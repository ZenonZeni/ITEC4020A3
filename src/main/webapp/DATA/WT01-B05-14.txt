PORTLAND, Maine - Nearly three thousand spectators cheered and shouted as the
winning electric vehicles crossed the finish line in downtown Portland on
Friday.<p>

 First vehicle across the finish was the Sunrise, a pre-production
prototype car built by Massachusetts-based Solectria Corporation which, one
day earlier, had set the event record, traveling 238 miles without
recharging. The Sunrise was also the overall top finisher in the week-long
American Tour de Sol national championship road rally for electric and solar
electric vehicles.<P>

        The second top finisher was a Solectria-built Force GT raced and 
sponsored
by a team from the Virginia Power Company. The third finisher and also the
top finishing utility vehicle in the event, was a Ford Ecostar sponsored and
raced by Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities. Both the Force GT and the
Ecostar are currently in production and available on the market.<P>

        Among students entries, the top scoring vehicles were from Mt Everett 
High
School in Sheffield, MA, Bolton (CT) High School and the Salisbury School in
Connecticut. The Mt. Everett vehicle was the top hybrid vehicle, one that
runs on electricity and also carries an on-board generator to recharge
batteries while on the road.<P>

        The Bolton High School entry was the top scoring student entry in the
Discovery Channel Commuter Category - the largest category in the American
Tour de Sol. This vehicle, called the Solar Bolt, also set an American Tour
de Sol record for vehicles powered by common, lead-acid batteries by
traveling 143 miles without recharging.<P>

        The other top student entry, built by students of the Salisbury School, was
the winning solar racing vehicle in this year's event. The solar racers are
designed with large "wings" covered with solar cells. These vehicles, built
specially for competition, run entirely on sunlight.<P>

        "This was the top field of electric vehicles we've ever had in the 
American
Tour de Sol," said race technical director Dr. Rob Wills. "There is no doubt
in my mind that what we've seen develop here is a technology and an industry
that can effectively meet transportation and environmental needs." Dr. Wills
said race officials were particularly impressed by the Solectria Sunrise.
"This may be the one everybody's been waiting for. Something that's clean
running, attractive and performs even better, in many ways, than a
gasoline-powered car."<P>

        Major sponsors of the 1995 American Tour de Sol include the United 
States
Department of Energy, the Waterbury (Connecticut) Region Visitor and
Convention Bureau, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the
Federal Highway Administration, the Maine Solar Blast and the Discovery
Channel.<P>

        The American Tour de Sol is organized by the Northeast Sustainable 
Energy
Association (NESEA), the nation's leading regional association involved in
promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting,
renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts,
NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields of
transportation, building construction and energy.
