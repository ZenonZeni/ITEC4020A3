BIOMEDICAL ETHICS IN U.S. PUBLIC POLICY

This (government issued) report covers biomedical
ethics in U.S. public policy.  It briefly reviews the
history of biomedical ethics and examines its potential
importance in public policymaking.  The report then
addresses: concerns about the many bioethical issues
that have not been analyzed at the federal level; the
prospect that these issues will arise more often in the
future; and the lack of a national institution to
explore the role of biomedical ethics in U.S. public
policy.

PLANNING WORKSHOP FOR DOE's ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL
TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE

The DOE has made major contributions in the biomedical
sciences with programs in medical applications,
instrumentation development, molecular biology, human
genome, and computational sciences.  In an effort to
help determine DOE's role in applying these
capabilities to the nation's health care needs, a
planning workshop was held (Jan. 11-12, 1994).  This
(DOE) document reviews the workshop, attended by
representatives of industry, medical research
institutions, national laboratories, and government
agencies.  The participants: defined the needs of the
health care industry; identified DOE laboratory
capabilities that address these needs; and determined
how DOE, in cooperation with other team members, could
begin an initiative having the goal of reducing health
care costs while improving the quality of health care
delivery through the proper application of technology
and computations systems.  Seven major technology
development thrust areas were considered, each
involving development of various aspects of imaging,
optical, sensor, data processing, and storage
technologies: (1) minimally invasive procedures; (2)
technologies for individual self care; (3) outcomes
research; (4) telemedicine; (5) decision support
systems; (6) assistive technology; (7) prevention and
education.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL COMPANY INNOVATIONS IN
BIOTECHNOLOGY

This work (by Bio-En-Gene-Er Associates) was undertaken
to help small businesses get on the fast track in
biotechnology research and development leading to the
spin-off of viable commercial businesses, probably with
the help of larger companies having the resources for
commercialization that are lacking in a small
enterprise.  Such resources could include financing and
positions in marketing, manufacturing, regulatory
affairs, and raw material supply.  In general,
biotechnology can be expected to have a major impact on
fundamental human needs engendered in the market
segments of: health care; agriculture; forestry; food
ingredients; industrial chemicals; plastics; energy;
mining; pollution control; and bioelectronics.

HIGH IMPACT-STRENGTH POLY(LACTIDE), A TOUGH
BIODEGRADABLE MATERIAL FOR MEDICAL AND OTHER USES

This translation of a Doctoral thesis from the
Netherlands (Groningen Rijksuniversiteit) covers
research on poly(lactide) aimed at gaining more insight
into the factors that determine the physical properties
and the applicability of these biodegradable polymers
in biomedical devices.  An important aspect is the
preparation of strong and tough amorphous materials
able to degrade in the human body by hydrolysis, to
yield harmless compounds.  The materials are primarily
designed for use as bone plates and screws in
maxillofacial surgery, but many other uses in medicine
and other fields are conceivable.  Materials based on
L-lactide are prepared by copolymerization with several
other cyclic esters, by blending amorphous
poly(lactide) polymers with degradable rubbers, and by
synthesizing block copolymers containing poly(lactide)
sequences.  Fundamental problems relating the
poly(lactide) chain stiffness and configuration in the
melt to the observed fracture behavior are addressed,
as well as more practical problems such as the
influence of processing variables on the properties of
poly(lactide).

STRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF PEPTIDE 6A FOR
INCREASING CORONARY PERFUSION FLOW

This translation from China (Beijing Medical
University) concerns structure modifications and
functions of Peptide 6A (P6A), one of the products
degraded from fibrinogen beta chain, that can increase
coronary perfusion flow (CPF) and inhibit thrombosis
significantly.  In this work, P6A was selected as the
lead compound and the residue Ala(sup 1) was
substituted.  Thus, the derivatives Lys(sup 1), Arg(sup
1), Asp(sup 1), Asn(sup 1), Glu(sup 1), Gin(sup 1) and
Gly(sup 1)-P6A were synthesized.  The bioassay
indicates that the substitution of amino acid with
acidic or basic side chain at position 1 of P6A will
decrease the vasodilation of P6A, and the substitution

ALCOHOL USE, ABUSE, AND ALCOHOLISM

Alcohol is a drug with potentially devastating effects
on the human body.  While no less dangerous than many
illegal drugs, society has accepted alcohol's negative
consequences.  Growing evidence indicates that alcohol
abuse and alcoholism jeopardize our economic base
through a loss of human resources, with a potentially
negative long-term impact on our nation's security.
Increased corporate and governmental focus is being
placed on prevention and rehabilitation.  This
(Industrial College of the Armed Forces) paper provides
a history of alcohol use and abuse, discusses the
characteristics of alcohol, and examines the economic
costs to American society.  It reviews the process of
abuser identification as well as the treatment programs
available in the military and civilian workforce.
Observations and recommendations are provided.

GENERATION OF TRANSGENIC CASSAVA HAVING REDUCED CYANIDE
TOXICITY

Cassava plants possess a cyanide toxicity that is
harmful to humans.  In fact, a correlation has been
demonstrated between the cyanide content of poorly
processed cassava and the occurrence of the
neurological disorder called Konzo.  This (Ohio State
University) report describes genetic research designed
to develop cassava plants having reduced cyanide
toxicity.  The strategy is to isolate and overexpress
the gene encoding linamarase, the enzyme that converts
linamarin into acetone cyanohydrin.  Most of the
research objectives are achieved, and some are even
expanded upon.  (This 1990 report was only recently
released for public use.)

EXTENDING THE VASE-LIFE OF CUT FLOWERS

This report (from the CAB Abstracts Database) concerns
methods and materials used to extend the vase-life of
cut flowers.  It covers, for example: the effects of
allelopathy, temperature, transpiration, and
supplementary light on vase-life; nutrient solutions;
growth regulators; silver compounds used as
preservatives; and more.  Many kinds of flowers are
covered, for instance: anemones; antirrhinums;
cinerarias; dahlias; cyclamens; dianthus; carnations;
freesias; gladiolas; iris; lilacs; lilies; and many
more, too numerous to list.  The report consists of a
collection of up to 250 abstracts of the latest
available reports, papers, studies, and other
documentation, with references for their acquisition
and extensive indexing to make it easy to find exactly
what you want.
