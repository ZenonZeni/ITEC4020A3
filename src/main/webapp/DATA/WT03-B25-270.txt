<I>A Multi-Sector View<BR>
David L B Jupp<BR>
CSIRO EOC Science Program Leader<BR>
<BR>
</I><HR><B>1. EARTH OBSERVATION IN CSIRO <BR>
<BR>
</B>CSIRO supports a significant effort in Earth Observation science (which
is basically the study and utilisation of data from instruments on remote
platforms - including aircraft and satellites) and its integration with
other data and models.<BR>
<BR>
Australia has a high international reputation for excellence and innovation
in this area and within Australia CSIRO has been a leader in creating that
situation.<BR>
<BR>
Earth Observation and remote sensing are generic technologies which cross
Sector and Divisional boundaries. They are also firmly engaged in the task
of meeting the objectives of the Sectors and Divisions that currently utilise
them. <BR>
<BR>
This mixed generic and applications oriented nature has sometimes lead to
duplication and fragmentation of effort as groups with different end user
communities tackle the same generic issues. This, despite the excellence
of individual contributions, can lead to overall under-achievement compared
with what is possible. Such fragmentation can only be overcome by increased
coordination and focus across Sector and Divisional boundaries.<BR>
<BR>
Despite such problems, it is clear from the presentations at the Sector
Outlook that Earth Observation and remote sensing are prominent in the plans
of a number of Sectors to meet the challenges of the future. This role is
especially clear in the growing needs for tools to measure, monitor and
evaluate environmental management systems The future opportunities and focus
areas for Earth Observation in the main Sectors which have included this
technology in their mapping and presentations are:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Biodiversity<BR>
</B><BR>
Advanced tools for environmental measurement ,monitoring and assessment
at many scales is a common theme which this Sector shares. Underpinning
this opportunity is the need for consistent data and standards of base processing
as well as operational tools for data analysis and integration with other
technologies, such as GIS. Many of the opportunities here will depend on
generic development of base information streams and the needs are shared
with other Sectors. It would be inefficient for these generic tasks to be
pursued in each Sector in isolation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Land &amp; Water<BR>
</B><BR>
Here, the opportunities and needs are clearly similar to those of Biodiversity
except that there are some special opportunities in large area assessment,
catchment management, water quality assessment and monitoring and soil moisture
and water balance studies. These tools are the basis for successful rapid
and large area monitoring capability. Again, there is a move throughout
the world to consolidate the 'pioneering' research of recent years and develop
objective standards and means to evaluate information quality. These standards
will need to use the skill base that is partly within the Sector but mostly
associated with other Sectors - such as Climate and Atmosphere and Marine.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Climate &amp; Atmosphere<BR>
<BR>
</B>The level of use of remote sensing and satellite borne measurements
in the Climate and Atmosphere Sector is very high. It is also set to grow
substantially as processed data streams enter the base of traditional meteorological
data with established standards and specific target measurements. The need
to establish processing technologies that exploit the physical basis for
remote sensing measurements underpins the successful incorporation of the
data streams into climate models and leads to a large proportion (possibly
60-70%) of the work being generic. The fact that these same generic technologies
are the ones that provide the consistent and standardised data streams needed
in other Sectors such as Marine, Land &amp; Water, Biodiversity and even
Mineral Exploration &amp; Mining should be carefully considered.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Marine<BR>
</B><BR>
There is considerable excitement in the Sector Outlook presentation when
it refers to the opportunities current and future streams of Earth Observation
data and associated instrumentation will provide for research and industry
in the Marine Sector. The scale of ocean and coastal processes can only
be consistently encompassed from remote platforms and the development of
new sensors and processing methodologies has provided information that makes
ocean surfaces, currents, productivity and the interactions of oceans with
other climate processes to be measured. Again, possibly 60-70% of the task
is generic and shared by the Climate and Atmosphere Sector, Land and Water
Sector, Biodiversity and the Mineral Exploration and Mining Sectors as they
utilise this technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mineral Exploration &amp; Mining<BR>
</B><BR>
In many ways, there is more maturity in the use of Earth Observation technology
in this Sector as mirrored in the way it is mentioned only in conjunction
with other instrumental and data processing technologies in the Sector Outlook
Forum papers. However, here there are emerging uses of new instruments with
very high spectral resolution and high sensitivity. Significantly, much
of the processing technology and methodology associated with estimating
surface mineralogy and abundances from remote sensing involves the same
fundamental physical science issues as are needed for exploiting high spectral
information in marine, coastal and inland waters or in searching for biological
resources.<BR>
<BR>
Other Sectors that might evaluate their utilisation of this technology are:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Forestry &amp; Forest Products<BR>
<BR>
</B>The needs here are similar to Biodiversity and there is currently close
collaboration between Divisions involved in these Sectors. Additional opportunities
come from the growth in high spatial and spectral resolution airborne technologies
and the convergence of traditional surveying and forest survey based on
aerial photography with digital 'geomatics' based processing and automated
'photo'-interpretation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Service Sector &amp; Information Technology &amp; Telecom Sector<BR>
<BR>
</B>Both of these Sectors are addressing the issues of data streams, communication,
pipeline processing and data 'mining'. These are primary technologies being
put to work in the standardisation of Earth Observation data. However, the
special needs of the processing technologies - being based on the physics
of environmental processes and instrument engineering makes them 'lessons'
for generic data processing that need to be learned.<BR>
<BR>
The following document supports these observations and outlines the way
the recently formed Earth Observation Centre (EOC) within COSSA is developing
Tasks that strengthen the strategic directions of Earth Observation and
overcomes the underlying impediments to success that have been present in
recent years. It is also proposed that the market for information based
on remotely sensed data products relevant to Australia and the Asia-Pacific
region will grow slowly, or at least the Australian share of the market
will grow slowly (or not at all) unless we move to ensure product quality
and standards. These standards can be productively and practically based
on the best science and achieve high quality. The groups that attain consistently
high quality and reliable information from these sources will win markets
in environmental monitoring and resource mapping that are already growing
strongly throughout the Asia-Pacific region.<BR>
<BR>
The means for CSIRO to address these questions is by consolidating our somewhat
dispersed activities and focussing and coordinating the generic activities
between Sectors whilst maintaining a strong capacity to address end user
needs and the needs of the suppliers of data and consultancies to end users
within Sectors. The Applications Oriented focus of groups directly addressing
Sector issues can be best enhanced by developing strong interactions with
the industry that will eventually deliver the quality products. The underpinning
generic developments can be best accomplished by coordinating and utilising
the existing skill base.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. THE EARTH OBSERVATION (EO) MARKET<BR>
</B><BR>
The EO Market in Australia in the past has been characterised by heavy government
investment and difficulties for the development of a true private industry
locally and in the Asia Pacific region.<BR>
Such characteristics are not atypical of the type of Market it has been
- an emerging market in a 'pioneering' stage. In the more mature areas of
EO and in many parts of the world, an Earth Observation industry is developing
which is moving from emergence to growth as characterised in the following
Table:<BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="market.gif" WIDTH="539" HEIGHT="827" ALIGN=bottom 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><BR>
This Table reflects the experience of Earth Observation and remote sensing
very well. The only point I think it does not emphasise enough is that in
the initial emerging phase there is often a lot of 'speculative' investment.
This is often by government. In a sense, there is easy money that encourages
growth of many small groups. In the growth phase the investment becomes
less speculative, groups need to consolidate and standards of product quality
are required. I believe this is happening in Earth Observation and we must
respond accordingly.<BR>
<BR>
If the growth phase is reached, it provides many opportunities. The main
opportunities for CSIRO to promote and share in this growth in our region
and to see Australian companies share in the growth are to develop standards,
quality, best practice from its wide experience and world recognised research
in past years. CSIRO can see these advanced methods transfer into the hands
of the market developers and the other (industrial) research groups who
provide the tools for the end users in the different Sectors. <BR>
<BR>
The main current problem for the early developers seems to be the reticence
of end users in the face of the prevalent 'pioneering' style of products
and the lack of objective standards. It is clear, however, that such standards
can emerge and the industry move from endless meetings of bureaucrats to
an active market of identified users and competent suppliers. CSIRO must
play an active role in this transition if Australia is to provide its share
of competent suppliers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3. SECTOR ACTIVITY<BR>
</B><BR>
The level of investment in Earth Observation and Remote Sensing in CSIRO
is high and spreads across many Divisions and Sectors. However, in any one
Sector, this activity is generally merged into the &quot;Chunks&quot; and
attached to the end purpose of the use of the technology. Identifying the
activity with its end use is not a problem, but low visibility is. It is
also hard to extract a total figure. <BR>
Some indication of the investment by Division is provided by the following
table giving numbers of people currently reached in the EOC mailing and
referred to as the Earth_Observing_Crew:<BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="table1.gif" WIDTH="413" HEIGHT="451" ALIGN=bottom 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>The COSSA Sector Mapping for the Sector Stocktake identified six Sectors
where support from COSSA as well as direct COSSA/EOC and Aircraft activity
could be mapped. These are: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Biodiversity<BR>
Climate &amp; Atmosphere<BR>
Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications<BR>
Land &amp; Water<BR>
Marine<BR>
Mineral Exploration &amp; Mining</BLOCKQUOTE>
The COSSA/EOC activity by Sector as defined for the Sector Stocktake is
presented in the following Table. It includes both a science component and
activity COSSA has pursued on behalf of the science activity in the form
of National and International liaison, management of missions, instrumentation
projects and communication. It mirrors the spread of scientists in the Earth
Observing Crew and is a level of underpinning investment that has produced
a level of high achievement in this area of CSIRO activity: <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="sector.gif" WIDTH="670" HEIGHT="244" ALIGN=bottom 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><BR>
This Table shows how COSSA (and the previous MDP19) invested in CSIRO Earth
Observation in a way that mirrored the centres of activity in CSIRO. Minerals
has greatest attention followed by Climate and Atmosphere, Marine and then
Land and Water and Biodiversity. This investment over the past 10 years
has supported the excellence that CSIRO and Australia are known for internationally.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4. SECTOR FORUM<BR>
<BR>
</B>The Sector Forum showed that remote sensing technology is seen as a
key element in a number of Sectors. The following excerpts are from the
Outlook Forum papers and show in what context the EO and remote sensing
activities were listed:<BR>
<BR>
<B>4.1 MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING SECTOR<BR>
</B><BR>
&quot;<I>3. CSIRO and the Sector<BR>
<BR>
3.2 CSIRO's Capabilities</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>CSIRO's core capabilities in support of the Sector's activities
encompass a range of disciplines and competencies including structural geology,
petrology, geochemistry, airborne and borehole geophysics, <I>remote sensing</I>,
computer modelling, mine planning, engineering, geomechanics, environmental
science and engineering. The Organisation's competitive advantage lies in
its ability to bring together multidisciplinary teams of sufficient expertise
and critical mass to address issues of national importance in a timely and
effective manner.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>With the exception of airborne gravity, airborne geophysics
is a relatively mature and highly competitive market<I>. The combination
of instrumentation on a single airborne or </I>satellite platform is likely
to be the next major advance, with significant potential for developing
commercially valuable intellectual property. Airborne gravity, on the other
hand is one of the last great frontiers in exploration geophysics - characterised
by high risk, significant cost, but potentially high returns.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>4.4 BIODIVERSITY SECTOR<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>&quot;3. CSIRO and the Biodiversity Sector<BR>
3.2 CSIRO's capabilities</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>CSIRO's size and the breadth of its disciplinary span provide
an in-house biodiversity research capacity unequalled in Australia. With
application to soils, water, plants, animals and microorganisms, disciplines
include ecology, genetics, biosystematics, microbiology, virology, biochemistry,
molecular biology, physiology, nutrition, pathology and parasitology. Skills
in GIS, <I>remote sensing</I>, survey design, modelling and expert system
design support the research and its application. Our skill base in sociology
and economics is small but expanding. Critical to the application of research
is the capacity to apply these skills in multidisciplinary teams to sector
needs; these teams also draw on skills from other CSIRO sectors, particularly
Land and Water. Important facilities include those for plant and disease
quarantine, including high biocontainment at AAHL, and the National Biological
Collections.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>4.5 CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERE SECTOR<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>&quot;2. Sector Outlook<BR>
Science and Technology Trends:</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>There will be increased use of communication and information
technology (including supercomputing) and of <I>remote sensing technology</I>.
The already strong emphasis on international collaboration and exchange
of information and technology will increase. There will be a continued increase
in the integration of disciplinary science and increased focus on research
applications. Developments in technology will enable a wide range of observations
(dynamical, analytical, microphysical, biological; both <I>in situ</I> or
by <I>remote sensing</I>) to be made with unprecedented resolution, precision
and coverage.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>3. CSIRO and the Sector<BR>
CSIRO Capabilities</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Scientific expertise and access to a wide range of facilities,
e.g. RV <I>Franklin</I>, RV <I>Australis</I>, GASLAB, ICELAB, Phytotron,
Airtrak and analytical chemistry facilities, LADM, DARLAM, SCAM, and other
local and regional models, TERSS and other <I>remote sensing </I>reception
and processing facilities, advanced instruments for surface boundary-layer
and cloud physics research, the CSIRO Climate Model, stratospheric chemical
model, advanced decision-support systems for management of rangelands, agricultural
production and rural fires.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Strategic Directions</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>A strong strategic research effort in atmospheric composition,
climate processes and climate modelling will be necessary to provide outcomes
on climate change adaptation and mitigation. There will be new contributions
to development and applications of <I>remote sensing </I>technology in both
strategic studies of the natural system and for natural resource management.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>4. Return to Australia Assessment <BR>
<BR>
Attractiveness<BR>
<BR>
</I>(2)<I> Australia's Ability to Capture</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is strong demand for the types of applications in air
pollution, climate change, climate variability and <I>remote sensing research</I>
that the Sector produces. Already the results are widely used and accepted
by government and industry. Public acceptance is very high and projected
to remain high. Prospects for future adoption of climate and atmosphere
research outcomes are excellent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Feasibility<BR>
<BR>
(3) R&amp;D Potential</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Scientific understanding in the Sector is well established and
is poised for rapid progress through the opportunities available from new
analytical<I>, remote sensing</I>, computing and information technology,
from the integration of disciplinary expertise and from increasing international
collaboration. There is a need to resolve underlying scientific uncertainties
in order to advance the science, its interpretation and its application.
Rapid and dramatic change in communication technology is expected to significantly
increase the opportunity to reach new users of research outcomes, particularly
through decision-support systems.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
This set of direct quotations indicates the pervasive view in these applications
oriented Sectors of the fundamental role of Earth Observation and Remote
Sensing to meeting their objectives. Perhaps the most obvious omissions
were the strong activity and opportunity for remote sensing of water quality
through optical models in the Water and Land Sector and the opportunities
for Radar and microwave remote sensing in a number of Sectors. There was
also no mention of the opportunities recent developments of geographic data
(such as digital elevation data) create through synergy with Earth Observation
data. It is clear, however, in all cases that physical measurements from
remote platforms (including aircraft and satellites) provide a primary set
of tools for future regional environmental monitoring and resource assessment.<BR>
<BR>
<B>5. THE CSIRO EARTH OBSERVATION CENTRE<BR>
<BR>
</B>The Simpson review of CSIRO Earth Observation infrastructure and activities
(Simpson <I>et al</I>., 1994 ) led to the formation of the of the CSIRO
Earth Observation Centre (EOC) as a science program in COSSA. The EOC has
been established to provide focus and leadership in Earth Observation science
for Australia and promote a coordinated and collaborative approach to generic
research and interactions in Earth Observation from satellites and aircraft
platforms in CSIRO. At the time of the Report, CSIRO Earth Observation was
achieving less than it could from problems of generic fragmentation and
unproductive duplication of effort. A new model was needed.<BR>
<BR>
The EOC has been established to pursue the generic Earth Observation science
that underpins the activities across many Divisions and Sectors through
coordination rather than by creating yet another competing group. It is
setting as its goal the exploitation of the high impact that physical sciences
can make on the Earth Observation market in this developed phase of its
growth and it uses a collaborative model in which the work is done by the
existing, in-place capacity in CSIRO.<BR>
<BR>
The Collaborative model defines outcome oriented projects, uses the best
teams from the applications (ie Sector) oriented Divisions as well as an
EOC 'core' group. By utilising existing structures rather than setting up
new ones the resources can be used efficiently and the benefits spread easily
back to the participating Divisions and their customers in their Sectors.<BR>
<BR>
The EOC Science Program has established its Science Plan and initial collaborative
Tasks based on this model. It has Focus areas in Applications Support, Measurement
Models, Data Systems and Sensor Systems. Information about the EOC can be
found on the WWW at: <BR>
<P><CENTER><A HREF="/eoc/eoc.htm">http://www.eoc.csiro.au/eoc/eoc.htm</A></CENTER>
<P>A primary problem facing CSIRO success in Earth Observation in every
Sector is, however. still generic fragmentation. As a result of it, in the
words of the Simpson Report, &quot;a given group's work attempts to cover
instrumentation development, ground station operations, algorithm development,
applications development, validation and product delivery. This task is
too big for small, geographically isolated groups.&quot; It was these attempts
in the past, within competing Divisional structures, that promoted the generic
fragmentation. Local beliefs in unique excellence were often simply duplication
of equally good activities at other sites. In the end, no-one was achieving
what they might through greater communication and collaboration.<BR>
<BR>
The EOC, as a science program in COSSA is seeking to map its collaborative
Tasks onto the Sectors in which the results create significant impact. Ultimately,
the main impact will be in the markets the Sectors support and it is this
impact that must feed back to justify the generic research. EOC Tasks are
aimed to bring the best teams of scientists together to tackle problems
that cross Divisional and Sector boundaries. In so doing, they impact on
the end users and markets in all of the relevant Sectors and create efficiency
of effort in achieving the impact. In a time of focus and consolidation
in the Earth Observation industry, we cannot afford to do less.<BR>
<BR>
<B>6. EOC TASKS<BR>
</B><BR>
The EOC is working with the Divisions involved to present a set of coordinated
and generic Tasks to the Sector process. By their nature, these Tasks will
be spread between Sectors and involve a number of Divisions. That is, they
need to be supported and resourced jointly by more than one Sector and allocate
the pooled support to more than one location. This is obviously not an easy
process. However, the efficiency and benefits of recognising and resourcing
the wide impact of coordinated underpinning Tasks in this area are clear
from the Sector Outlook Forum papers.<BR>
Among the generic Tasks being undertaken through the EOC are some which
underpin all of the Sectors above and some which may be in only a few -
or even one. However, they all benefit from the collaborative focus of people
and groups from different Divisions and with often diverse applications
and disciplines. The Tasks are truly cross Divisional and cross Sectoral
and underpin Earth Observation in all of these as well as their target industries
and markets.<BR>
<BR>
The initial Tasks being commenced this year through the EOC will involve
contributions from Divisions through the involvement of the existing CSIRO
base of Earth Observation skill and capacity as well as the EOC and (where
appropriate) outside contributors and are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Primary Thread:</B> <B>Earth Observation Data Consistency &amp; Standardisation</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Generic Task Areas:<BR>
<BR>
1. Instrumentation</B><BR>
The EOC is developing an information system to CSIRO capacity in field instrumentation
as well a common pool.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. Calibration Sites</B><BR>
Current and some new calibration sites based on land and marine targets
are being developed collaboratively and used to establish base consistency
for AVHRR, GMS and Landsat satellite data.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3. Scene Brightness</B><BR>
The issue of scene modelling and physics impacts on all scales of data and
is being addressed both empirically and from a scene physics base.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4. Algorithms and Processing</B><BR>
A common set of software tools and best selections of algorithms for processing
is being established and promoted among CSIRO and collaborating groups.<BR>
<BR>
<B>5. Validation Missions</B><BR>
Selected missions that validate algorithms, calibrations and products are
being promoted and coordinated to establish protocols and tools for the
assessment and maintenance of product quality.<BR>
<BR>
<B>6. Data management &amp; Communication</B><BR>
Base tools and demonstrations of data management and communication are being
coordinated with the other Tasks. The selected data streams are the means
of evaluating this technology for CSIRO benefit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>7. Product presentation, Quality &amp; Standards</B><BR>
For selected data streams of AVHRR, GMS and Landsat (in the short term)
provide the demonstrations of product quality that results from coordinated
generic processing Tasks and the collaboration of CSIRO best teams.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to these Task there are also some Working Groups planned. These
are providing the assessments needed the development of future Tasks.<BR>
<BR>
<B>EOC Working Groups:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Hyperspectral, Energy &amp; Water Balances &amp; Fluxes,
Optical Water Quality, Unmixing; Radar applications</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
These Tasks and Working Groups address needs of the growing market as well
as the research needs of CSIRO Divisions. They represent areas of activity
which, if pursued individually by Divisional groups in the current climate
of careful investment and limited resources will produce lower overall impact
than could be attained from the full base of excellence and research focus
that CSIRO can collectively provide. They must, however, be resourced in
the future through mapping into more than one Sector and on the basis of
support and promotion by (often) many Divisions. <I>Some mechanism is needed
to make this </I>feasible and attractive. <BR>
<BR>
EOC Tasks represent a form of generic underpinning and collaboration that
may seem to challenge the Sector structure but which must ultimately be
promoted by the Sector process if the clear efficiencies are to be captured.
Earth Observation and remote sensing are not the only generic technologies
in this position but they are a clearly defined example of the benefit of
supporting areas across the Sector and Divisional boundaries.<BR>
