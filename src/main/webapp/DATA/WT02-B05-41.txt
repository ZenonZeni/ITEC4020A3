<H3>I.	Overview</H3>
The first organizational meeting of the Internet Freedom Network was held
in Toronto, Canada on May 13, 1996 sponsored by the Open Society Institute
and organized by the Center for Democracy and Technology. The meeting was
held in order to:

<UL>
<LI>discuss online freedom of expression issues;
<LI>identify work being done in this area around the world;
<LI>establish a network of NGOs committed to free expression and the free
flow of information and the Internet; and,
<LI>plan means of sharing information regarding developments in online free
expression; and,
<LI>explore ways to participate in regional and international policy decisionmaking
forums which will affect the Internet.
</UL>

Attendees included NGO representatives from Africa, Asia, Western and Central
Europe, the United States, and Canada, as well as public policy specialists
from online service and Internet software companies.  Special thanks go
to the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX) whose directors
and staff provided guidance and logistical support for the meeting.<BR>
<BR>
The outcome of the meeting was a strong agreement that more coordinated
work is necessary among existing groups in order to advance and protect
free expression on the Internet.  The assembled organizations also agreed
that efforts should be made to help new advocacy organizations develop outside
the United States whose sole mission is to address Internet free expression
issues.  The remainder of the summary outlines the issues discussed and
lists action items agreed to by the participants.<A NAME="pubpolicy"></A><BR>

<H3>II.	Public Policy Issues Identified</H3>
Meeting participants raised a great diversity of Internet freedom issues
from every continent around the world.  Yet, in discussing Internet free
expression issues, a number of common policy issues emerged.  This is a
road map of the common policy themes that were discussed:<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>A. Internet Service Provider Liability: ISP as bottleneck and government
leverage point restricting the free flow of information</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) -- those entities which provide users
access to the Internet in each locality -- whether non-profit organizations,
government agencies, state telecom monopolies, or competitive businesses,
are the sole access point to the Internet for users large and small.  ISPs
may also maintain World Wide Web sites and Internet news servers for their
users, thereby increasing their importance in the functioning of the Internet.
 As such, ISPs have become key targets of government censorship efforts
directed at the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
Example:	The government of Zambia recently banned an edition of the Weekly
Post, an opposition newspaper published in the country.  The Weekly Post
has, for some time, published its work both on paper and on their World
Wide Web Site, on a server maintained by their Internet Service Provider.
 The ban made it a crime to be in possession of the any copies of the banned
material.  The government used this as a means to force the ISP to remove
the offending material from its Web server.  <BR>
<BR>
Issue: The critical place of ISPs in the Internet framework make them particularly
vulnerable to government intimidation and legally-sanctioned censorship.
 ISPs, however, are generally mere conduits of information or hosts for
web sites, simply offering the technical means for users to receive and
disseminate information.  In most cases, ISPs have no knowledge of the content
of the messages that they transmit, or even the World Wide Web sites which
they host.  ISPs are critical gateways for access to the Internet, as well
as for the flow of information from individuals in any one area to the rest
of the world.  If ISPs become fearful of government penalties arising from
information which is transmitted or hosted by the ISP, however, the ISP
may well be induced to restrict the free flow of information through its
facilities.  Though it is impossible to screen all of the numerous messages
and massive amounts of information on a typical web site, even the attempt
to do so would severely restrict the free flow of information on the Internet.
 <BR>
<BR>
Post script:  As it happens, before the banned articles were removed from
the Zambian Web site, an Internet user in the United States downloaded the
material.  The banned articles are still available on web servers in other
African countries and the United States.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>B. Internet Service Market Structure: State-run, private monopoly,
or competitive markets</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
As Internet services begin to develop around the world, a variety of market
structures are emerging.  In many cases, restrictive telecommunications
regulations, combined with the pattern that Internet services often originate
in university settings, lead to the result that Internet access is effectively
limited to certain classes of users in only small regions of the country.<BR>
<BR>
Examples: A number of countries place strict controls on the Internet market,
limiting access to the Net in general.  Here are a few examples discussed:
<UL>
<LI>Singapore: ISPs must be licensed as broadcasters, with numerous regulatory
requirements.
<LI>Equador: The State bank has the exclusive right to provide Internet
services in the country and the only international connection to the Internet.
 The conditions make it difficult for alternative access providers to develop
and provide services.
<LI>Botswana: ISP are banned altogether.
<LI>Zimbabwe:  ISPs exist but appear to be illegal under the national telecommunications
law.
</UL>
Issue: The regulatory structure of the Internet service market has a substantial
impact on the number of users in a country who have access to the Internet,
as well as the general free flow of information in that country.  If there
is only a single ISP, or merely a small number of them, the likelihood that
such services will be intimated by governments increases.  Moreover, if
Internet service are provided by state-run or state-controlled institutions
such as universities or telecommunications para-statals, the opportunity
for government control of content is also increased.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>C. Regulatory models for the Internet: Is it broadcasting, print,
or something new?</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
As the Internet increases in popularity around the world, national governments
and regional entities such as the European Union are wrestling with the
question of how to fit the Internet into the current regulatory structure
which governs traditional communications media, or whether to create new
regulatory models.  The outcome of these decisions are critical for the
free expression rights of all users online.  Yet, most policy makers are
deciding these issues in forum without any input whatsoever from the user
community.<BR>
<BR>
Examples:  Recent developments include:

<UL>
<LI>Singapore: The government has already decided to regulate Internet Service
Providers as traditional broadcasting entities, thus imposing numerous regulatory
burdens and content controls on ISPs.
<LI>United States:  With the passage of the Communications Decency Act,
the US Congress has imposed a variety of radio and television broadcast
indecency restrictions on Internet users, content providers, and service
providers.
<LI>Australia:  The Australia Broadcasting Authority is currently considering
what regulatory model to apply to ISPs.
<LI>European Union:  Actions now pending before various EU bodies (with
a first reading already having occurred in the Parliament) would impose
a variety of broadcast-like regulatory requirements on ISPs throughout Europe.
</UL>

Issue:  Imposition of broadcast-like regulations on the Internet would be
a fundamental impediment to the free flow of information online.  Regulations
which may have been appropriate and easily applied in the broadcast context,
simply make no sense when applied to the Internet.  Moreover, extension
of broadcast regulations give governments a great degree of censorship authority
over Internet content.<BR>
<BR>
Note:  Actions take by governments around the world will have an impact
on the free flow of information globally.  Of particular concern, however,
are actions that may be taken by the European Union over the next year.
 A number of Central European states are seeking EU membership.  So, decisions
taken by the EU regarding the Internet now will be binding on the new members
in the future.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>D. Citizen Access to Government Information</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The Internet can be a powerful enhancement of citizen's access to government
information such as the text of law, legislative proposal under consideration,
as well as judicial and regulatory decisions.  Especially in newly emerging
democracies, it is important to identify successful models for use of the
Internet to increase citizens participation in governing processes.<BR>
<BR>

<STRONG>E. Communications Privacy: Electronic Surveillance Online and the
status of Internet Wiretaps in International Law</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Free expression only exists where citizens feel that the privacy of their
communications and associations are sufficiently protected from government
intrusion.  Many uncertainties exist regarding the legal limitations on
electronic surveillance on the Internet.  Meanwhile, numerous national restrictions
on the use of encryption leave the Internet environment without basic security
protections.

<UL>
<LI>Lack of International Human Rights Standards:  At present, there is
no international law or international human rights standards that clearly
address the issue of electronic surveillance on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>European Union encryption policy:  The EC DG XIII is about to issue
a policy proposal regarding the use of encryption technology for privacy
protection and government access to electronic communications.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>United States encryption policy:  After the highly controversial Clipper
Chip proposal, the US is moving forward with policy alternatives aimed at
controlling the use of cryptography in order to assure law enforcement access
to private communications.
</UL><BR>
