<h1><center> Cephalon's timeline for NDA </h1> </center> <p>

NEW YORK -- Cephalon Inc. plans to file an NDA for Myotrophin (insulin-like growth factor-1) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the end of the year or in early 1996, according to President and CEO Frank Baldino Jr. <P>

The company on Monday revealed data from its pivotal Phase III trial of the drug, showing statistically significant, dose-related consistent success in slowing the progression of ALS with no related adverse safety issues <A HREF ="/BioCentury2/archive/1995/2qtr/061295ex.htm"> (see Monday's BioCentury Extra for details)</A>. <P>

CEPH shares climbed $7.875 to close at $18.375 on 6 million shares traded. <P>

On Monday, the company added details to its initial announcement of the clinical results and also released retrospective data pointing to a statistically significant higher rate of survival for patients taking the higher tested dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day of Myotrophin compared to the placebo group. <P>

<B><CENTER>'Heroic effort' </B></CENTER><P>

Baldino said the company will make a "heroic effort" to file an NDA before year-end, but it may not be able to do so until early 1996. He predicted that the FDA will take about one year to approve the drug. <P>

The agency has requested and received data disks from CEPH, in advance of its formal submission, and is working with the company to expedite the review, he said. <P>

William Rutter, chairman of partner Chiron Corp., said relatively minor changes will have to be made to CHIR's manufacturing facility in Vacaville, Calif., to permit commercial production of the drug. He predicted that it will take 18 months to adapt the plant to use a different yeast and receive FDA certification. Myotrophin is currently being manufactured at CEPH's pilot plant in Beltsville, Md. <P>

Manufacturing and marketing costs will be split evenly under the companies' agreement. CHIR will handle commercial manufacturing and CEPH will continue to provide product for trials. <P>

CHIR will receive 50 percent of the profits from U.S. sales of Myotrophin. CEPH's share will be minus an allocation of 11.5 percent of gross sales, which will go to Cephalon Clinical Partners L.P. <P>

The data presented Monday and at a scientific meeting in France on Saturday will be integrated into a formal scientific paper "within a few weeks," said Eugene Lai of the Baylor College of Medicine, a principal investigator in the trial. He told BioCentury that the paper will flesh out some of the scientific explanations for what occurred, but it will not include any data beyond what has been presented to date. <P>

The primary end point of the North American Phase III pivotal trial in 266 patients was the Appel ALS (AALS) Rating Scale, a six-point patient evaluation system designed to provide a quantitative measure of clinical status. CEPH cited medical literature indicating that a 20 point change in AALS score represents a clinically significant shift in patient well-being. <P>

<B><CENTER>Average baseline</B></CENTER><P>

The average baseline AALS score was 70. Patients with a score of 52 experience some weakness and other symptoms and frequently need minor aid such as a cane, but are independent and can live alone. At 74.5 points, patients are no longer independent and must restrict their diets to soft food; at 99 points speech is slurred and suction is required to compensate for decreased swallowing ability; at 119 points patients are homebound and wheelchair bound; and at 135 points patients have no ability to speak, are quadriplegic and require total care and tube feedings. <P>

Patients receiving the 0.1 mg dose progressed at a mean rate of 3.3 AALS points per month, while those on placebo progressed at a rate of 4.2 points (p = 0.01), said Michael Murphy, senior vice president for worldwide clinical research. The results are based on a last observation carried forward (locf) analysis, and a less rigorous analysis would produce more favorable results, he said. <P>

As a group, patients on placebo crossed through the AALS 20-point level of progression at six months, Murphy said. In contrast, patients on the high dose of Myotrophin did not cross that threshold during the nine-month trial. <P>

<B><CENTER>Secondary end point</B></CENTER><P>

The secondary end point was the sickness impact profile (SIP), an independent measure of patient perceived sickness. Telephone interviewers asked each patient 135 questions related to 12 physical and psychosocial categories assessing aspects such as sleep and rest, emotional behavior, body care and movement, home management, mobility, social interaction, ambulation, alertness behavior, communication, work, recreation, and eating. <P>

The SIP change from baseline at the end of the study was 5 for the high dose group and 9 for the placebo group (p=0.01). For the psychosocial component of SIP, patients getting the high dose registered a mean increase of 1, compared to 4 for the placebo group (p=0.03). The physical sub-component values were 8 for the drug group and 11 for the placebo group (p=0.1). <P>

CEPH hasn't conducted a detailed analysis of the AALS sub-components. <P>

Although death was not included in the protocol as an end point, a statistical analysis of survival was performed on a post hoc basis. The survival data show a statistically significant benefit from the Myotrophin high dose over the placebo arm, but several factors limit the utility of this analysis. <P>

Under the protocol, patients progressing beyond a threshold level were forced out of the trial and the nine-month duration limited the ability to study survival. There were 32 dropouts from the study. <P>

Murphy said evaluation of the protocol and the subsequent open-label study after 15 months on an intent-to-treat basis demonstrated a 16 percent trend in favor of the high dose Myotrophin arm over placebo (p =0.04). There were a total of 100 deaths during the trial. <P>

Baldino said Myotrophin has "three domains of effect -- muscle, motor neuron survival and peripheral nerve sprouting," but scientists have not determined its mechanism of action in ALS. <P>

Recently completed trials of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's Riluzole demonstrated an impact on survival, but not on quality of life, in ALS patients. <P>

Lai said "it makes sense for the sake of the patients" to conduct combination trials with Myotrophin and Riluzol. <P>

<B><CENTER>Phase IV</B></CENTER><P>

Murphy indicated that following an FDA approval, the company will initiate Phase IV trials of Myotrophin to determine if a higher dose has greater clinical effect. He said the 0.1 mg daily dose was well tolerated with few reported adverse events, so it is likely that a higher dose could be administered. <P>

For the 10 most significant adverse events, only one, injection site pain, presented a statistical difference between the Myotrophin and placebo arms, and it was in favor of Myotrophin. The placebo arm experienced 85.6 percent injection site pain compared to 77 percent for the high dose Myotrophin group. 
The only other adverse events with a statistical difference were not clinically important, said Murphy. These included: injection site inflammation (24 percent high dose, 7 percent placebo), hair growth/texture (15 percent high dose, 3 percent placebo), sweating (23 percent high dose, 12 percent placebo), knee pain (11 percent high dose, 1 percent placebo), and facial edema (9 percent high dose, 1 percent placebo). One patient was discontinued for non-compliance. <P>

UBS Securities analyst David Crossen said Myotrophin is potentially a billion dollar product. "There are 30,000 cases in the U.S., another 60,000 worldwide, and about 10,000 new cases are reported annually," he said. "So you could get 100,000 people taking it. If you can charge $10,000 for a year's therapy, you have a billion dollar market worldwide." <P>

He said the pricing might have to "crack" if competing products come to market. He mentioned development of CNTF for ALS by CytoTherapeutics Inc. (CTII) <P>

If physicians opt for combination therapy of Myotrophin and CNTF, Riluzole, or another compound, the price also could be forced down, Crossen said. <P>

The last ALS patient in a European trial of Myotrophin was treated on June 3. Murphy said the European trial will be officially closed on July 3. <P>
