<H2>A New Year...But It's The Same Old Bull Market!</H2>
</center>
Yes, it's a new year!  And we never cease to wonder at the number of
predictions of where the stock market will be a year from now.  Why so many
predictions?

<CENTER><h3>Imagine You're An Intelligent Farmer . . .</h3></CENTER>
<P>
Many decades ago we read a science fiction novel about the state of the
world, post-apocalypse.  Vegetation in the recovering world was so scarce
that when a roving band of survivors found a thin crop of corn, tended by a
solitary settler, they quickly devoured the shoots, leaving nothing but
dirt.  Understandable, perhaps, given the circumstances.  But how much
better they would have fared had they had the patience to wait for the
ripening of the real crop!
<P>
Imagine a farmer growing corn in Iowa today.  He plants various seeds in
various fields.  The crops in some fields, of course, develop faster than
others.  But if he's an intelligent farmer, he expects this.  And he knows
it would be the ultimate in foolishness to go out and harvest the small,
developing ears of corn in his best-performing fields in the early days of
their growth.
<P>
Yet this is what many investors do!  They buy a stock, believing it has the
potential to make them big money.  Then as soon as it increases 30%, 50% or
100% they go out and sell it!  To us, it's the ultimate in foolishness!
What these investors should be doing, if they want to make really big money
in the market, is buying more of their best performers.
<P>
By emphasizing your winners and maintaining a long-term attitude, you can
put yourself in a position to take advantage of the magic of compounding.
This way, your profits continue to work for you instead of for the tax man!
