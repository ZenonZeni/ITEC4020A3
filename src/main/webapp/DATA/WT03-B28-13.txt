CONTINENTAL, TACA GROUP SIGN CODESHARING/MARKETING ALLIANCE

      Continental Airlines and the Taca Group of Central American
airlines, which compete in numerous U.S.-Central American markets,
will team up in a new marketing and codesharing alliance.
      The pact will provide for the Taca reservations code on
Continental flights between its Newark hub and Miami, Houston and
Dallas, as well as Houston and Los Angeles. Continental's two-letter
code will appear on selected Taca Group flights between Panama City
and several destinations including Guayaquil, Quito and Santo Domingo.
      The agreement will become effective June 1, this year, subject
to the approval of the U.S. government and El Salvador.
      The Taca Group consists of Taca International Airlines,
Aviateca, Copa, Lacsa and Nica.
      "Central America and the northern tier of South America are
important markets for Continental and are obviously the home markets
of the Taca Group carriers," says David Grizzle, vice president-
alliance development for Continental.
      "This alliance will increase the presence of Continental in each
of the markets we already serve, add some additional markets, and will
improve the Taca Group's reach into the U.S."
      Grizzle says Continental will benefit from increased schedule
convenience for passengers, improved through check-in and seat
selection, and OnePass frequent flyer mileage accrual opportunities on
Taca airlines. The frequent flyer cooperation is reciprocal, so Taca
passengers flying on Continental flights also will be able
to accrue Taca mileage.
      What was unclear last week is if Taca customers may also accrue 
mileage through LatinPass, the 15-airline frequent flyer program whose
chief founder is Taca Group Chairman Federico Bloch. A Continental
spokeswoman did not know if mileage could be transferred to LatinPass,
and officials at Taca, including Bloch, were unavailable at our press
time.

LUFTHANSA, SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS SIGN COOPERATIVE ALLIANCE

      The chairmen of Lufthansa and South African Airways (SAA) signed
a cooperative pact that cements the alliance between the German and
South African flag carriers. Cooperation between the two airlines will
center initially on codesharing flights from April, the inter-linking
of frequent flyer programs and cargo operations, Lufthansa says.
      Members of Lufthansa's "Miles & More" frequent flyer program and
SAA's "Voyager" program will have their miles pooled. Customers will
be able to transfer mileage between accounts.
      The airlines are also planning to introduce joint ground
handling services during the summer of this year or early in the
1996/97 winter season, as well as through-checking and joint use of
each other's airport lounges. Lufthansa says the two airlines will
begin offering on April 1 a total of 29 codesharing connections to
three destinations in Germany, Frankfurt, Munich and Duesseldorf, and
to two in South Africa, Johannesburg and Cape Town.
      Lufthansa also codeshares with United Airlines and Thai Airways
International. Lufthansa will operate seven flights a week between
Frankfurt and Johannesburg, while South African Airways will operate
six fights per week between the two airport hub cities.
      Lufthansa will operate three flights a week between Frankfurt
and Cape Town and SAA five flights. In addition, SAA will offer two
flights per week from both Duesseldorf and Munich to Cape Town and
also from Duesseldorf and Munich to Johannesburg.

MALAYSIA AIR CHAIRMAN SAYS VIRGIN ATLANTIC STILL CODESHARING

      Malaysia Airlines (MAL) last week denied that Virgin Atlantic
Airways is considering pulling out of its code-sharing arrangement
with the national carrier in the London-Kuala Lumpur-Australia market.
Executive Chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said, "We have not heard any
implication of that sort." Tajudin was responding to reports
suggesting that Virgin Atlantic would formally request dissolution of
the code-sharing arrangement.
      Under the agreement, MAL and Virgin operate 14 weekly
frequencies from Kuala Lumpur to London, and seven weekly frequencies
to Australia using MAL aircraft. "Mr. Branson is a gentleman. If he is
not satisfied over something, I am sure he would have told us about it
himself," Tajudin said. "In fact, he is in constant contact with us.
We're very happy with the (code-sharing) arrangement."
      The code-sharing agreement, which came into effect last May, was
considered a coup by Malaysia Airlines, because it enabled the carrier
to market to passengers needing to fly through London onto the
European continent, or the opposite way to North America. Malaysian
officials have so far been frustrated by long-running attempts to get
authority from Britain or France for rights to pick up local
passengers at London or Heathrow on long-haul flights from the Far
East.

TAIWANESE COMPANY PLANS PANAMANIAN AIRLINE

      A Taiwanese airline company plans to begin an intercontinental
airline in Panama, sources say. Evergreen Marine Corp., which founded
Eva Airways, will boost its involvement in Panama in part because of
the connections Evergreen Chairman Chang Jung-fa has with the
Panamanian government, sources tell Airline Marketing News. Chang was
named an investment adviser to Panamanian President Ernest Perez
Balladares last year.
      The airline is expected to begin international service from
Panama by July, the sources say. Equipment being considered for the
venture include 767 and 757 equipment from Boeing and A340 and A330
aircraft from Airbus Industrie.
      Eva has applied with Panamanian authorities to begin an airline
that will fly to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia, sources
say, adding that the airline has long-term plans to operate to the
U.S., Europe and Asia. Eva also has asked Panama's incumbent
international airline, copa, to become a minority shareholder, the
sources say, but has not yet received any response. The offer was made
in November.
      Eva Airways now operates long-haul service from Taipei to Los
Angeles and last year began linking that daily trip with Panama.

BUSINESS TRAVEL PRICES WILL RISE 3%-4% IN 1996, AMEX PREDICTS

    Airlines should benefit from an increase of 3%-4% in air travel
prices in 1996, according to a publication released by American
Express (Amex) in December. The publication, 1996 Trends & Forecasts
for the Business Travel Industry, suggests the increase is on top of a
5% increase in average fares from 1994 to 1995, suggesting a minor
slowdown in price increases.
    For 1995, typical business fares were estimated to have risen 3%,
based on data from the first three quarters of the year.) For October,
the latest full month in 1995 of actual booking data available, the
average fare paid by business travelers rose 12% higher than October
1994, based on corporate reservations booked through Amex in the 215
routes tracked by its "Airfare Index" for business travel. 
    In addition, full-coach fares rose 3% from October to November,
while the lowest discount fares fell by 1%. The lowest discount fare
level, however, is 14% higher compared to November 1994.
    Discount fares will be difficult for business travelers to find,
Amex says, suggesting that average full-coach fares will continue to
rise. Amex says load factors are forecast to reach a record high of
67% by the end of 1996. "There's no relief in sight for 1996," Amex
adds, "as passenger traffic is expected to outstrip supply growth,
bringing fares back to nearly 1993 levels."
    Electronic distribution will play a larger role in streamlining
business travel and reducing costs, Amex suggests. "Travel agencies,
airlines and computer reservations systems providers are introducing
tools this year that enable booking travel by e-mail or Internet, or
direct computer dial-up to reservations services," Amex says. "If not
booked through a corporate preferred agency, however, employees may
find themselves paying 15% to 20% more than corporate rates.
    "These tools," Amex says, "along with electronic expense reporting
software, are expected to reduce the administrative burden on
travelers, and streamline accounting and data management associated
with travel."
    The publication estimates that the average company spends 43% of
its travel and entertainment budget on air fares, with 21% on lodging,
8% on car rentals, 25% on meals and 3% on miscellaneous expenses. Amex
believes U.S. companies spent approximately $140 billion on travel and
entertainment in 1995.

DELTA TO CRS VENDORS: LOWER FEES TO REDUCE DISTRIBUTION COSTS

    Delta Air Lines issued a plea to computer reservations system
vendors to help it reduce distribution costs incurred through agents'
booking practices.
    Since the option of electronic ticketing is rapidly becoming the
industry norm, "CRSs will be forced to offer product distribution for
lower participation fees, and the more efficient CRSs will have an
advantage over other systems," says Robert Coggin, executive vice
president-marketing for Delta.
    A recent rate increase will bring Delta's CRS distribution costs
to $250 million annually, the airline claims. "Continued rate
increases and other CRS marketing practices, such as productivity
pricing, which encourage abuse, will only encourage Delta and other
carriers to implement practices designed to minimize or eliminate the
distribution of their product through CRSs."
    Airlines have been increasingly concerned about "productivity
pricing," which offers substantial bonuses to travel agents who book a
certain number of segments in a given period on one airline. The
practice, airlines claim, encourage agents to make large numbers of
false bookings.
    "We are at a critical juncture in our effort to determine the most
cost-effective means of distributing our product," Coggin says. "While
Delta has long supported CRS distribution, we cannot support an
inefficient system which relies on increasing participant charges as
its primary source of revenues." Coggins says that if Delta cannot
reduce distribution costs "through dialogue," it will have no choice
but to find other avenues "that might be available to us." Coggin did
not say what those avenues might be.

ATLANTA-BASED NEW-START INDEPENDENCE AIR GETS NEW PRESIDENT

    Independence Air, the potential new-entrant airline that wants to
begin widebody transcontinental service using Airbus aircraft, has
named a new president whose goal is to begin service by the second
quarter of this year. Roy Hagerty, a 25-year industry veteran,
replaces Barry Harris, a former acting administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration, who decided to return to his consulting
business in Washington after less than two months with the fledgling
firm.
    It was the second such leadership change at Independence Air.
Before Harris, the Department of Transportation indicated to the
company that the appointment of Stephen Quinto, one of the airline's
founders, would be inappropriate due to the bankruptcy of his last
airline, Northeastern, in 1982.
    Hagerty, who most recently served as president of Airline
Development Group, a consulting firm based in Raleigh, N.C., says the
company needs some $6 million in startup funds to get off the ground.
The company is still looking at Airbus A300B4 aircraft, which can
carry some 270 passengers depending on configuration, but also is a
good cargo aircraft.
    Before his job at Airline Development Group, Hagerty was chairman,
president and CEO of CCAIR, Inc., a U.S. regional airline that
operated as Piedmont Commuter and later USAir Express. Hagerty grew
the business from a money-losing effort in 1983 to a $60 million firm
that reported profits of $4 million in 1991. Before CCAir, Hagerty ran
Coastal Air, which operated Southeastern Airlines, from 1972 to 1983.
    Hagerty told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week that he
plans to hire several former Eastern Airlines officials who had
recently left Independence Air after Harris resigned.

DELTA, AMERICAN EXPRESS LAUNCH CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD

    Delta Air Lines and American Express said Jan. 4 they are
launching a cobranded credit card that awards Delta frequent flyers
one mile for each dollar charged. The Delta miles will never expire.
In addition, Delta offers 1.5 SkyMiles for purchases of Delta and
Delta Connection tickets using the card, as well as for Delta Dream
Vacations.
    The card has an initial annual percentage rate of 8.9% for the
first six months of membership. After that the rate for purchases is
prime plus 9.4%, which under today's rates would equal 17.9%. Interest
rate for cash advances is prime plus 12.9%.
    Annual fee is $55, which is being waived for primary American
Express personal, Gold and Platinum cardmembers. Annual cap on
SkyMiles accumulation is $60,000 in charges, except for the bonus for
Delta purchases, which has no cap.

AMERICAN UNVEILS EXPANDED CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM

    American Airlines unveiled Jan. 9 a new corporate travel program
that includes a new MasterCard corporate charge card.
    The new card is being combined with the Air Travel Card, which has

marketing, "delivers a comprehensive billing and payment system to
better manage all of a company's business travel expenses."
    GE Capital Financial Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE
Capital, is issuer of the new card. The card features American's "AA"
logo along with the Air Travel Card symbol and the MasterCard logo. It
also doubles as a long-distance calling card.

FORMER KIWI EXECS FORM CONSULTING GROUP FOR START-UPS

    Prospective new-entrant airlines may find a friend in former Kiwi
International Airlines CEO Robert Iverson. Iverson and several of his
colleagues have formed a consulting group to help startup carriers get
off the ground. Turn Key Aviation Co. was formed in response to
interest airline executives had for Iverson's Kiwi start-up blueprint,
he says.
    Marketing is one of the key ingredients to key success for a new-
start airline, and Iverson tells Airline Marketing News that he tries
to "focus people on those marketing ideas and opportunities specific
to the startup environment." New-start executives waste a great deal
of money, he claims, on marketing programs tailored to major airlines
that don't apply to new entrants. "Marketing dollars are extremely
scarce for skimpily-funded airlines," he says. "Very often, there's
such a lack of marketing expertise with small airlines that they will
run to something that seems very sexy to the public, not realizing
what effects it will have on them."
    One of those areas is loyalty programs. Iverson warns new entrants
not to be lured into frequent flyer alliances with major airlines that
bring with them large per-passenger expenses. "Try to take a close
look at what your non-cash resources do for you in customer loyalty,"
he says. "Unfilled seats are one of those resources."
    As an example, he suggests that a new-entrant carrier offer one
free roundtrip for every five roundtrips. "You reward the customer for
frequency and make it simple for the airline," Iverson says.
    Iverson also advises airlines to shy away from large computer
reservations systems for distribution purposes. "Our feeling is,
looking at successes such as Western Pacific and ValuJet," he says,
"comes very definitely down on the side of an in-house, proprietary
reservations and yield management system. I think they allow
tremendous flexibility in the control of an airline's inventory."
    Citing Western Pacific as one of the most successful startups to
utilize good internal yield management, Iverson says, "Our
understanding is that they have the ability to almost instantaneously
reallocate fares and availability to maximize yields."
    An in-house system also allows an airline to much more easily
maximize revenues, and he cautioned against taking too much of a
simplistic approach to pricing. "Kiwi and UltrAir thought it would be
a wonderful idea for a single price, unrestricted ticketing scheme,"
Iverson recalls. "What wound up happening is that they turned over
their inventory to the major carriers, because all they [major
carriers] had to do was lower their fares in one of their `buckets,'"
a term used in the airline industry to describe a category of
restricted fares.
    "Kiwi ultimately had to approach it from a much more traditional
yield management system," Iverson says. Instead of buying an off-the-
shelf system, however, Iverson says the carrier "tried to do it
piecemeal." It hired individuals with yield management expertise from
other airlines "and then tried to meld it into the Kiwi process."
    It was not an easy cultural change to make, Iverson recalls, after
Kiwi reservations and sales employees had become accustomed to a
simplified pricing scheme. "When multi-tiered ticketing and
restrictions popped up," he says, "it was not accepted by the staff.
We had to show we were losing a significant amount of money per seat.
Then people started buying into it."
    Advertising and external promotions also are a critical element of
short-term success, Iverson says. He notes that ValuJet spent nearly
half of its startup capital of $3 million on advertising and related
promotions. "Southwest Airlines," he says, "spends something like 80%
of its annual advertising budget for a new market in the first couple
of months of a new service." For a three-aircraft startup, he
suggested a figure of some $1 million per year.
    He also advises startups to "take a non-traditional look at how to
get your name out to the public." Use innovative public relations to
maximize your free publicity. Southwest, ValuJet, Air South and
Western Pacific are all good examples of innovative publicity yielding
benefits nearly equal to that spent on advertising and sales
promotions.
    Sussex, New Jersey-based Turn Key says it is currently is working
with three start-up carriers that expect to launch service this year.
"Our group is different from other consulting concerns in that we have
arranged for sources of financing, have aircraft ready to be put on a
certificate and have a marketing and public relations team that made
Kiwi a household name," Iverson says.

MARKETING BRIEFS

    * Gulfstream International Airlines, the Florida-based U.S.
regional carrier, is introducing the "Sun Pak" ticket booklet this
month. It allows business travelers to purchase a ticket booklet for
10 or 20 one-way trips between selected Gulfstream city pairs. No
advanced reservations are required, and there are no cancellation
penalties.
    * Inflight amenity kits supplied by Wessco International for Delta
Air Lines passengers in first and business classes won a "Diamond"
award from Onboard Services magazine (see photo at right).
    The awards are presented annually to recognize outstanding and
innovative new programs or concepts to enhance passenger service and
safety.
    The Delta kits, designed by Wessco Vice President Anne Gittelson,
feature a small carrying pack, a document holder, a tie or scarf case
and a compact disc case in black leatherette. A fitness book describes
exercises a traveler may do in an airline seat, and how to use a
sample set of "Essential Elements" aromatherapy products said to
combat jet lag.

YIELD MANAGEMENT/RESEERVATIONS

    * Cardinal Airlines, Caribair and Dolphin Express Airlines are now
using mainframe hosting and technical services from Worldspan Travel
Information Services, a computer reservations system company, based in
Atlanta. Worldspan was formed when Delta's Datas II CRS and TWA's
system, which was called PARS. The two merged in the late 1980s to
form Worldspan.
    * ValuJet, the Atlanta-based DC-9 airline that started service on
Oct. 26, 1993, will open its third reservations center in Newport
News, Va., in February. The center will initially employ 200 with
eventual plans for 450. ValuJet awarded a contract to TAD Aviation
Services to staff and manage the center. It will operate the same
hours as existing centers in Atlanta and Savannah, Ga. -- 5 a.m. to 1
a.m. East Coast time.
    * Worldspan named a new chief financial officer. Samuel D. Horgan
replaces former CFO Mark S. Mulvany, who is retiring this month.
Horgan was previously CFO for Buffalo, N.Y.-based Computer Task Group
(CTG), a New York Stock Exchange information technology services
company.
    * United Airlines has completed programming and testing for its
participation in Worldspan's "Airline Source," which allows Worldspan
travel agents to directly access United's seat inventory and true
last-seat availability according to class of service. Agents receive
immediate acknowledgement of booking.
    * Covia Technologies, part of the Galileo International group that
operates the Apollo computer reservations system, sold its Distributed
Applications Products and Services business to Siemens Nixdorf
Information Systems of Burlington, Mass. The Covia unit joining
Siemens Nixdorf provides software and consulting services to airlines
worldwide, such as Delta Air Lines, Eva Air of Taiwan and Japan
Airlines.
    * Sabre Travel Information Network has begun offering electronic
ticketing to United Airlines passengers. With travel agents now able
to book United domestic tickets electronically through three of the
four major U.S. CRSs -- Sabre, Apollo and System One -- United's
electronic ticketing service is now available to the majority of
agents in the U.S. So far, however, Sabre has not yet developed an
electronic ticketing service for its sister airline subsidiary,
American Airlines.

AIR SOUTH TO START BUSINESS-CLASS SECTION; EXPANDS TO FLORIDA

    South Carolina-based start-up Air South will install a business-
class 'club' section in its aircraft, looking for an upgraded fare in
a low-cost market. The airline also will start new service to several
southern U.S. destinations, mostly in Florida.
    Air South Chief Financial Officer Tom Volz says the carrier will
charge $20 extra for an "up-front club section" seat. At the same
time, it will eliminate "lounge areas" it has had on its six Boeing
737s-200s. The airline has lowered costs from 14 cents per seat mile
when it first flew last year to about eight cents. It costs Air South
8.3 cents per seat mile to fly a 250-mile segment, Volz says.
    The airline is expanding southward, mostly to the new focus areas
of both Southwest Airlines and ValuJet Airlines: Florida. Air South
will soon start non-stop service from South Carolina to Atlanta,
Raleigh-Durham, Jacksonville and Myrtle Beach. New one-stops are
planned to Miami, Tallahassee and Tampa-St. Petersburg. 
    Air South executes a "hub-bypass strategy," says Volz, where the
airline, for example, will not fly through Atlanta unless we have to.
The airline also will go ticketless early in 1996 and expand into
larger markets, including Chicago, Florida, New York and Washington.
    "We have to be at least 11 units [aircraft] to realize advantages
of scale," says Volz, pointing to the carrier's need for five more
737s.
    Volz also says Air South, which received substantial assistance
from the state of South Carolina, has put $12 million back into the
state's economy in the past year.

CANADIAN PLANS BUSINESS-CLASS UPGRADE IN 737 FLEET

    Canadian Airlines International, having finished a sweeping
upgrade of business-class service in international markets last year,
is now focusing attention on its narrowbody fleet. The first segment
of the fleet to get upgraded business class sections will be the 737s,
37 of which are flown by Canadian.
    The 737s will be reconfigured and outfitted with 12 wider
business-class seats. The new seats will replace 20 economy-class
seats. In addition, the pitch between each of the 88 remaining coach
seats will be lengthened by an inch, to 34 inches. Pitch for business
class will be 39 inches.
    Gregg Saretsky, vice president-passenger marketing for Canadian,
says the move is partially prompted by last year's "open skies" U.S.-
Canada air services agreement, which opened up transborder services to
a variety of new markets and new entrants. "The bar has been raised to
maintain a superior business class on shorter-haul routes," he says.
    The reconfiguration program begins Jan. 28. One 737 per day will
be reconfigured through March 3.

BRITISH AIR SUBSIDIARY TO OFFER 25% INCREASE IN CLUB EUROPE SEATING

    British Airways' subsidiary in Europe, GB Airways, will increase
Club Europe business-class seating by 25% on most of its fleet of 737-
400 narrowbody aircraft. The change will bring a total of 36 Club
Europe seats in -400 aircraft. The fleet will be reconfigured by the
end of March. The increase in Club Europe seating is due to strong
demand in Club Europe cabins on flights to Spain, Tunisia and Morocco.
    "Demand remains buoyant, mainly as a result of the steadily
improving economy in Europe," says Peter Kenworthy, GB Airways general
manager-commercial, "and as more British companies look at the
investment opportunities in North Africa."
