<B>MNR Studies Walleye Populations In Lac Seul
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that MNR and a group of partners will conduct a three-year study of the walleye population in Lac Seul, one of the major recreational lakes in northwestern Ontario.<P>

"This study will ensure the regulations we have in place are sufficient to protect the lake's walleye population over the long term," said Mr. Hodgson.  "A healthy walleye population is important for the continued economic health of this area which is widely celebrated for its great fishing."<P>

This is the first year of the three-year project designed to monitor new fisheries regulations such as the slot size and trophy limits that came into effect in the early 1990s. <P> 

Ministry of Natural Resources staff from both the Sioux Lookout and Red Lake offices will work in partnership with the Lac Seul Advisory Committee (LSAC), the local chapter of the Federation of Ontario Anglers and Hunters, the Sioux Lookout/Hudson Tourist Association, the 
Ear Falls/Perrault Falls Tourist Association and more than a dozen area tourist operators.  The goal of this partnership is to protect the lake's walleye population for generations to come. <P> 

"The slot size and trophy regulations were recommended to the ministry to prevent an over-harvest situation from developing," said Gary Beardsley, a member of the LSAC and a tourist operator on the lake.  "The project has increased local interest in monitoring Lac Seul's high quality fishery. We are pleased to contribute to projects like this which will benefit everyone over the long term."<P>

In an effort to conduct an extensive two-week netting study of Lac Seul's walleye population this past September, ministry partners provided manpower and equipment totalling about $21,000.  MNR provided about $17,000 including the staff expertise to design and supervise the project and analyse the results.  Similar preparations are being arranged for the next two years of this study.<P>

During the random netting study this September, a few lodge guests who were present became interested and even asked to help out.<P>

"One of the lodge guests from Minnesota told us that the netting program was an incredible learning experience," said Al Mathews, MNR's Sioux Lookout District Manager.  "He wrote a note to MNR to thank the lodge owners for their efforts to keep Lac Seul the best fishing lake he had ever seen."  
Mr. Mathews commended MNR's partners for their commitment to get more involved in gathering information that is used to make fisheries management decisions.<P> 

Lac Seul is about 150 kilometres long and 1,500 square kilometres in area, making it the second largest lake wholly in Ontario. Due to its size, Lac Seul comprises the entirety of Division 30 as described in the Sport Fishing Regulations Summary. A variety of fish species is found within the seven management zones of Lac Seul, including walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and muskellunge.<P>  

Walleye is the favourite sport fish of the thousands of visitors who come to Lac Seul from all over the world to fish.  If data gathered from this project result in recommendations for changes to current regulations, the public will be advised and asked for comment through the Lac Seul Advisory Committee and the MNR.<P>
