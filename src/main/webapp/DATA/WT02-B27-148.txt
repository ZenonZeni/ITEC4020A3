<H1>Not just an issue of life and death - the British Social Attitudes
Survey</H1>

<H3>David Donnison</H3>

<H6>New statistics on support for euthanasia amongst the British public
show some startling trends. As part of probably the most influential and
respected official survey conducted in Britain, Professor Donnison, the
current Vice-Convener of VESS, authors the background work that VESS can
use as political ammunition in the fight for reform.</H6>

<P><BR>
<BR>
Euthanasia - helping people out of this world when they decide that they
want to leave it - has gone on since the dawn of time. But it was seldom
talked about. People usually died in their own homes. What happened in
their last hours was known only to their closest relatives and perhaps
to a doctor or nurse. But now decisions about death are seldom out of the
headlines for long. Why the change? <BR>
<BR>
The advance of medical technology is bringing a steadily growing majority
of deaths into hospitals where life, of a sort, may be prolonged for a
long time. Someone has to decide what nature used to decide for us. Those
decisions are no longer taken privately in a small family group but amidst
a constantly changing crowd of doctors, nurses, patients and technicians.
<BR>
<BR>
Death itself grows harder to define. In Britain at any one time there are
about two thousand people who have spent more than six months in a persistent
vegetative state from which they will never recover. Many dread the pointless
indignity of such a fate, and they are asserting their right to be heard
with growing confidence. Whose death is it anyway? <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, as drugs have been made less lethal suicide becomes harder to
arrange without professional help. Ten years ago you could get a prescription
for sleeping pills, go home and swallow the lot, and that was that. Now
you just wake up with a splitting headache. <BR>
<BR>
For these and other reasons, more and more decisions about the ending of
life are brought to the courts which are ill-equipped to handle them. Can
it be right that some people kill themselves while still capable of doing
so because they know they cannot ask anyone to help them once they become
incapable? Or that doctors are entitled to withhold treatment from dying
patients if &quot;best practice&quot; suggests it would not be &quot;in
their best interests&quot;, but cannot then withdraw it unless the treatment
has clearly failed? Or that a court should be asked to decide whether a
feeding tube which accidentally fell out should be replaced? Or that many
good doctors admit that they have risked their careers by helping patients
to die when they were asked for that last service? Such dilemmas have led
some of our best judges to conclude that it is high time Parliament reviewed
the whole issue. <BR>
<BR>
The increasingly angry debate about euthanasia helps to explain the reluctance
of politicians to tackle this hot potato. On the one hand are those who
say that &quot;Life is a gift from God and is not ours to do with as we
please&quot;. (Cardinal Winning's spokesman recently.) On the other are
those who say that &quot;There is a constitutionally protected interest
in determining the time and manner of one's own death&quot;. (A recent
decision by a U.S. Federal Appeals Court.) Both standpoints can be forcefully
argued. But what do the British people think of them?. <BR>
<BR>
The most thorough study yet made of their opinions appears in the latest
of thirteen annual reports on British Social Attitudes, published today.
This shows that the more extreme contenders on both sides speak for small
minorities of our people. Seven situations which might justify euthanasia
were described. Only 5 per cent of those interviewed would oppose euthanasia
in every one of them; and only 7 per cent would approve it in every one.
The great majority of our fellow citizens would approve it in some cases
but not in others. They are a cautious, pragmatic lot without clear-cut
principles: very British. <BR>
<BR>
When seeking explanations for profound differences of opinion in Britain,
the usual suspects are education, class, political allegiance and gender.
But these throw little light on this case. The most resolute opponents
of euthanasia are those who go regularly to church (of any religion); those
who oppose abortion, suicide and capital punishment; and those who worry
about the power of doctors and do not trust them. Other factors play a
part, but these are the most important. Those who chose &quot;the right
to life&quot; as their slogan may have tapped a deeply rooted seam of values
cutting across class and politics. <BR>
<BR>
But time is likely to be on the side of the reformers. Acceptance of abortion
and suicide, abandonment of church going and other patterns associated
with support for euthanasia are more often found among younger people than
among the older people whom they will steadily replace as time goes by.
<BR>
<BR>
Reform, when it comes, will have to be by private member's bill, for each
Party is pretty evenly split on the issue. Changes in the law will be piecemeal,
opening a way to euthanasia in some cases but not in others, and leaving
plenty of room for further argument. That may seem a disappointingly messy
outcome. But it may be no bad thing that we shall have time to monitor
what happens and make sure that proper safeguards are built in before we
go further. <BR>

David Donnison, Emeritus Professor at the University of Glasgow, wrote,
with Caroline Bryson, the chapter on euthanasia in British Social Attitudes.
the 13th Report, edited by Roger Jowell and others. (Dartmouth, 1996).
It was Donnison's connections which enabled euthanasia to be included as
a study area for the first time in this national Study. A lifelong champion
of the poor, the homeless and the unemployed, Donnison has focussed his
internationally renowned skills in Social Policy &amp; Administration to
the dilemmas presented in attempting reform for voluntary euthanasia to
the great benefit of VESS. His engagements on behalf of the Society have
included representing VESS at political party conferences and he has also
been active penning articles on euthanasia for the press. He joined the
VESS Executive Committee four years ago and presently serves as our Vice-Convener.
