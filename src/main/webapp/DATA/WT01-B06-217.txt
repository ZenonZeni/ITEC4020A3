<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Cross Creek has been making all of its high quality leisure
clothing in the U.S. since 1935. In fact, the company's dealer catalogue
boasts, "As always, the Cross Creek Collection is made proudly and completely
in the United States." Cross Creek is best known for its excellent men's
knit shirts. All Cross Creek knits are short-sleeved shirts sporting solids

Cross Creek also offers men's turtlenecks and a <I>Pro Collection</I> golf
line that features several women's knit skirts, Cross Creek logo knit tops

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Van Doren Rubber hand makes 100% of its Vans "tennis shoes"
in Orange, California. The company started out in 1966 manufacturing canvas
tennis shoes and selling them directly to the public in its own California
stores.</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The skateboard craze of the 1970s and the appearance of
a pair of black and white checked Vans on movie star Jeff Spiccoli in the
1980 hit "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" helped turn Vans into a virtual
nationwide craze.</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Today, Vans offers a dizzying array of 200 fashionable leisure
shoes for women, men, children and infants. From classic deck shoes and slip-ons
to trendy high tops and midcut shoes, all Vans combine CVO uppers and thick
bottom soles to create the Vans signature look. The shoes come in either
canvas or suede and are available in a variety of colors, including brights,
earthtones, neutrals, pastels, solids and prints. You can also custom order
a pair of your own design. A basic Vans canvas tennis shoe is a good alternative
to all-imported Keds.</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Vans are exported to 43 countries. They are available in
the U.S. in over 4,600 outlets nationwide and are modestly priced at between
$20 and $40.</FONT></B>
