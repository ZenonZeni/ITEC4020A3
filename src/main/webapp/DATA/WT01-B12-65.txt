<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>PROGESTERONE OVERLOOKED</H2>
  Thousands of women in the western world are now using natural progesterone, generally in the form of a non-prescription product that is applied to the skin. They consistently not only claim less "female" symptoms, but experience increased vitality, better skin and a renewed emotional balance.  Natural progesterone has unfortunately been almost totally overlooked by medical science while the erroneous focus has been placed heavily (almost completely) on estrogen. It is important in this modem day for us to have a much better understanding of progesterone, the important natural hormone that it is.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>PRECURSOR</H2>
   It has been little realized that progesterone, like DHEA, has been referred to as the "mother of hormones." Progesterone is an important  precursor  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  adrenal corticosteroids, which protect us against stress, and of all the sex hormones, including both testosterone and estrogen. This means that progesterone can be turned into one of many different hormones in the body as they are needed to maintain various metabolic functions in almost all of our tissues.  Unfortunately, most all the emphasis has been put on the importance of estrogen. However, it must be emphasized again that both estrogen and testosterone are made from progesterone.  Without adequate progesterone, both testosterone and estrogen would not be sufficiently available to the body.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>ESTROGEN DOMINANCE</H2>
   About 600,000 hysterectomies are performed every year in the USA alone.  According to Dr. Stanley West, noted fertility specialist and chief of reproductive endocrinology at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York and author of The Hysterectomy Hoax, about 90 percent of all hysterectomies are unnecessary. Dr. John Lee, long time medical practitioner and researcher of progesterone, has discovered a consistent theme running through women's complaints associated with PMS and menopause. That is, they experience estrogen dominance or put another way, they have too much estrogen in relationship to the amount of progesterone in their bodies.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>HRT</H2><P>
   These women, contrary to their actual needs, are given synthetic estrogen drugs.  In other words, when their estrogen levels are already too high when compared with progesterone levels, they are given more estrogen. It has become mainstream in modern medical practice to prescribe estrogen for menopausal and related symptoms.  This is referred to as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by doctors.  The delicate estrogen/progesterone balance is greatly upset by too much estrogen, so progesterone deficiency is exaggerated all the more. Doctors have been able to balance the estrogen-dominance effect through with progesterone.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>NATURAL PROGESTERONE<P></H2>
   Between 40 and 60 percent of all western women experience premenstnral syndrome(PMS). Natural progesterone is made from wild yams or soybeans, whose active ingredients are an exact molecular match of the body's own progesterone. It is interesting to note that in countries in Asia and South America, where women eat quantities of either wild yams or soybeans, the term "hot flash" doesn't even exist in their languages. They also rarely experience most of the female problems plaguing western women.  One researcher, Jerilyn Prior, chief endocrinologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, has demonstrated that osteoporosis occurs in athletes to the degree that they become progesterone deficient. She became convinced that loss of bone density (osteoporosis) could be the result of progesterone deficiency. This was later confirmed by a three year study including sixty-three post-menopausal women.
   Natural progesterone supplementation is not known to have any side effects and no toxic levels have been found to date.  When adequate levels of progesterone are present in the body, libido is increased, the skin stays hydrated and oxygenated, facial hair growth and hair thinning is prevented, less depression occurs, fat burning is encouraged and blood clotting remains normal. There appears to be less breast and uterine cancer among women with higher levels of progesterone as well as less menopausal and PMS problems, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.<P><P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN & PROGESTINS<P></H2>
  A New England Journal of Medicine article in 1995 involving 121,700 women revealed that women who used synthetic estrogens and progestins to offset the symptoms of menopause also increased their chance of developing breast cancer by up to 40 percent by taking them for more than five years.   Current knowledge is evolving that these synthetic products are not good. Not only are synthetic estrogens responsible for increasing the probability of breast and uterine cancer, but also of increased storage of body fat, fluid retention, depression, headaches, impaired blood sugar control, reduced oxygen in cells, gallbladder problems, decreased sex drive, increased probability of fibroids and bone loss.
   The attempt to offset the negative effects of synthetic estrogen with synthetic progestins, only complicates the problems all the more.  It is important to know that the group of drugs that are referred to as progestins  are not progesterone.   They  are compounds that have altered molecules of progesterone that can be patented by companies for profit.  Synthetic progestins are not exact replicas of progesterone and can cause numerous side effects, such as headache, depression, fluid retention, increased risk of birth defects (they are included in birth control pills), liver dysfunction, breast tenderness, acne, insomnia, swelling, weight changes and PMS-like symptoms. They are not progesterone!<P><P>
