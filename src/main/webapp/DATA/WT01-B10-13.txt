<h2>Clues from Your Menstrual History</h2>
The complexities of regulating ovulation remind me of the difficulty a musical conductor faces when combining a hundred individual performances into a symphony. Although each individual plays an important part in the production, the overall performance ultimately depends on the precise <i>coordination</i> of all the players. If even one instrument is unsynchronized or off-key, the delicately balanced harmony can turn into disorganized noise.<p>
In the "ovulation symphony" harmony can be disrupted by disturbances in the menstrual cycle. Instead of an unwavering pattern repeated from month to month, infertile women frequently complain that their periods are irregular or have stopped altogether, and some women have never experienced men-strual flow.
So, like the semen analysis, your menstrual history serves as a simple screening test to guide my investigations. It won't tell me precisely what the fertility problem is, but it will tell me where to look for further clues.<p>
<h2 align=center>The Three Types of Menstrual Patterns
</h2>
<b>The Regular Menstrual Period
</b><br>
The critical point about this category is that your period is <i>regular</i> from month to month, beginning like clockwork every twenty-five days or every thirty-five days, for example. If your periods are regular, you are probably ovulating. The <i>consistently irregular</i>  menstrual cycle, however, where one month you begin menstruating after twenty-five days, the next month after thirty-four, and the next in thirty, may indicate that you have a fertility Problem. If a woman reports a regular menstrual history, I'll usually look at other areas of the reproductive system for a breakdown in the fertility formula.<p>

<b>Irregular Menstrual Periods or Amenorrhea for Six or More Months</b><br>

This is the most common complaint found with fertility problems, The woman's menstrual periods occur infrequently and at unpredictable intervals. Some women, like Kathy S., even report that at some point their periods stopped altogether. Because these women are capable of menstruating (as demonstrated by their history), there is a good chance that with the proper treatment ovulation and a regular menstrual cycle will resume.<p>

<b>Nonexistence of the Menstrual Period</b><br>

Women who have never menstruated may have genetic abnormalities, congenitally deformed reproductive organs, delayed puberty, or a pituitary malfunction. If by the age of sixteen a woman has not started menstruating, she should be concerned. It is important to diagnose the problem early and to determine if such women will respond to hormonal therapy or surgical correction. The emerging new technologies offer the most promise to these people. More about that in <a href="ch21mb.html">chapter 21</a>.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>
What Is Ovulation?</h2>

Ovulation is a fascinating harmony performed by several different "players" — your hypothalamus, your pituitary gland, and your ovary. Your hypo-thalamus maintains the hormonal "tempo" by regularly pulsing GnRH (go-nadotropic-releasing hormone). These pulses stimulate your pituitary gland to produce LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). <h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2><img src="ch111.gif"><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
Your pituitary gland plays the chorus—a pattern repeated from month to month in a beautifully precise rhythm. Each month the pituitary secretes FSH to stimulate the development and growth of over one thousand eggs. This phase in the ovulation cycle is known as the follicular phase. At puberty a woman has about half a million primitive germ cells. Only four or five hundred, however, will ever reach maturity. Due to some mysterious mecha-nism which we don't yet understand, usually each month only one of the thousand developing eggs becomes dominant and grows to maturity. This egg, or ovum, is cradled within the ovary in a tiny, fluid-filled capsule called the follicle.<p>
During the follicular phase of your cycle, LH acts on the ovary's theca cells to initiate estrogen production by the granulosa cells. The estrogen makes the follicle even more responsive to FSH, which further stimulates follicular growth and development of the egg. As the follicle expands toward the surface of the ovary, the egg increases in size nearly forty times. The ovary tells the pituitary when it needs more or less FSH to finish the job of egg maturation by making a feedback hormone called inhibin (folliculostatin) .<p>
Shortly before ovulation, the genetic material (nucleus) in the egg divides (meiosis) to half the number of chromosomes in the cell. If the egg is fertilized a second meiotic division leaves the ovum with twenty-three chromosomes—a perfect complement to the sperm's twenty-three. To form an egg, the female germinal cell divides twice, as does the male germinal cell. During female germ cell divisions, however, the "surviving" ovum jealously hoards the bulk of cellular material (nutrients) and casts off the excess genetic material (polar bodies). The egg or (if the egg is fertilized) the embryo survives on these nutrients until the embryo successfully implants in the woman's uterus.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2><img align=center src="ch112.gif"><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
Estrogen also stimulates the uterine lining (endometrium) to become thick, lush, and filled with nutrients for the embryo. The cervical mucus responds to elevated estrogen by becoming clear, watery, and stringy. Normally impervi-ous to sperm, at midcycle the mucus welcomes the sperm and promises easy passage toward the egg. When dried on a slide, the "friendly" mucus shows a characteristic ferning pattern. <a href="ch152.gif">(See figure 15-2)</a><p>
When your estrogen level peaks at midcycle, the pituitary "knows" that the egg is ready to embark on its journey. The pituitary responds to the estrogen peak by producing a surge of LH, which releases the egg within eighteen to thirty-six hours. The outer wall of the ovary dissolves away from the bulging follicle, and within two to three minutes the ovum escapes into the woman's abdominal cavity. Surrounded by a sticky protective layer of cells (cumulus oophorus), the egg gently floats toward the fallopian tube. The expelled follicular fluid stimulates the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube to reach toward the ovum, grasp the ovary, and vacuum up the egg. The muscles and tiny hairs (cilia) lining the fallopian tube gently coax the egg on its three-to-four-day journey through the narrow passage. For conception to occur during this cycle, the sperm must fertilize the egg in the fallopian tube within twelve hours of ovulation. (See <a href="mb101.gif">figures 10-1</a> and <a href="ch151.gif">15-1</a>.)<p>
During the egg's journey, the ruptured follicle begins an amazing transformation into the corpus luteum. Stimulated by LH from the pituitary gland, this yellow-pigmented, glandular, ovarian structure enlarges to make up nearly a third of the ovary. During the <i>Luteal phase</i> (latter half of the cycle), the corpus luteum produces progesterone, a hormone that prepares the uterine lining for implantation of the embryo. Progesterone also acts on your body's temperature-regulating mechanism by raising basal body temperature (BBT) approximately one-half degree. Thus shortly after ovulation, you will see a rise on your BBT chart.
If fertilization does not take place, the corpus luteum deteriorates. Estrogen and progesterone levels decline rapidly in the week or so prior to menstruation. Deprived of these hormones, the endometrium atrophies and menstrual flow begins. At the site of the original follicle the corpus luteum
degenerates and leaves a minute piece of scar tissue as a reminder of its brief existence.
If fertilization takes place, a <i>corpus Irwteum of pregnancy</i> forms to maintain the uterine lining (endometrial bed) and support the implanted fertilized ovum (conceptus). I'll discuss more about fertilization and implantation in <a href="ch19mb.html">chapter 19</a>.<p>
The hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary must all work in perfect harmony. When they do not, the most obvious symptom is abnormal menses. And the nature of the abnormality clues me into the source of the problem. <a href="ch12mb.html#table125">Table 12-5, "Conditions That Can Interfere with Ovulation and Menstruation,"</a> gives an overview of which fertility problems are caused by malfunctions of the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, pituitary feedback system, and other related systems. The diagnosis and treatment for these disorders are discussed in the remainder of this chapter and in <a href="ch12mb.html">chapters 12</a> and <a href="ch13mb.html">13</a> .<p>

In the remainder of this chapter I will explain how I approach evaluating ovulation in the woman with a regular cycle. The next two chapters will explain how I approach evaluating women who have never had a period and women who have irregular periods or periods that have stopped.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>

<h2 align=center>Evaluating the Woman
with Normal Menstrual Periods
</h2>
"My period is so regular," Margaret B. explained, "that whether or not I've started, on the thirtieth day I insert a tampon before I go to work. By noon I'm always glad I did, because otherwise I would have had an accident."
When I hear this type of menstrual history, I'm almost certain that the woman is ovulating each month. My attention turns immediately to diagnosing other fertility problems. However, on the outside chance that nature is tricking us into complacency, I ask the woman to keep a basal body temperature (BBT) chart for a couple of months or monitor her urine for an LH-surge. When accurately kept, the BBT will confirm the timing of ovulation and will help me properly schedule other tests. <p>

<b>Interpreting the Basal Bobby Temperature Chart</b><br>
<img src="ch113.gif"><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<i>The normal ovulatory pattern:</i> Measure your basal (resting) body temperature first thing in the morning—even before getting out of bed. During the f follicular phase (the first half of your cycle) the "normal" BBT pattern should show only slight variations in your temperature (under 98 degrees). In response to progesterone produced at midcycle by the corpus luteum, your BBT will rise about a half degree (to about 98.4) and should remain elevated until your next period begins. The two or three days <i>preceding</i> the temperature elevation are your most fertile. After your temperature rises, the odds of initiating a pregnancy become minimal. By reviewing this data over two to three months, you can usually predict your most fertile days.
<i>Failure to ovulate:</i> If your temperature remains relatively constant throughout your cycle, you did not ovulate.<p>
<i>Short luteal phase:</i> If you are undergoing ovulation induction treatment, you will want to pay particular attention to the fourteen days following ovulation. Should your period start within ten days of the temperature rise, you may have a progesterone deficiency (luteal phase defect). Without an adequate progesterone supply the uterine lining will not develop properly and the embryo will fail to thrive.<p>
<i>Sustained temperature rise:</i> A sustained rise in your temperature—beyond the date for your next period—should make you jump for joy because you are probably pregnant!<p>
<i>Additional data:</i> Variations in temperature levels aren't the only data recorded on BBT charts. You can also indicate the days you menstruate (with an X), the days you have sex, the day you feel mittleschmerz (the twinge of pain associated with ovulation), and days when you are ill or out of sorts. When kept with care, this record can provide valuable information for planning your fertility treatment. Table 11-1 explains how to keep your chart.<p>
Don't get too uptight about keeping the BBT chart. If doing so causes you problems, discuss it with your doctor and consider urinary LH testing. Although the BBT can provide important supportive data, it isn't absolutely necessary. Your peace of mind is far more important than creating a graphic history of your sex and reproductive life. <p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>

<h3 align=center>Table 11-1</h3>
<a name="bbt"><h2 align=center>How to KeepYour Basal Body Temperature Chart</h2></a>

<dl><img align=top src="blue.gif">   Begin taking your temperature on the morning your menstrual period ends.<p>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Shake down the thermometer the night before and place it on a bedside table.<p>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   At your first waking moment take your temperature by inserting the thermometer in your mouth, vagina, or rectum for five minutes. Do not vary your procedure from day to day or month to month. Use a clock to time yourself. DO NOT smoke a cigarette, eat or drink, or get up to go to the bathroom or to go find your thermometer before taking your temperature.<p>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Record the <i>thermometer reading</i> on your chart under the correct day of your cycle (day 1 is the first day of your period). Record the <i>days you have sex</i> by placing an arrow at the bottom of the column. Record the <i>days of your menstrual flow</i> with an X. Record <i>mittleschmerz</i> if you feel it. <i>Note any exceptions</i> on your chart—for example, if you are ill, did not get a good night's sleep, or are running a fever. Also mark when your doctor performs any tests and what they are.<p>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Wash the thermometer with cool soapy water, rinse it, shake it down, and place it in its protective case beside your bed. Some people prefer to use alcohol or disposable plastic thermometer protectors.<p>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Repeat this procedure every day until your next period begins. Each month start taking your temperature on the morning your menstrual period ends.<p>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Take your charts to every doctor's appointment.</dl><p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<b>Living with BBT</b><br>
Keeping the BBT chart is an inexpensive method for observing your menstrual cycle and hormonal system at work and an indirect method for ballparking when ovulation will occur. BBT charts will help indicate your most fertile days, so you can plan sex at the "right" time of the month.<p>
I've had some women tell me in total frustration that they're ready to flush their thermometer down the toilet. "If I have to plot another flat line, I think I'll scream. Every morning the mercury reminds me that I'm a failure."
I have a few suggestions that may help you put BBT charting into proper perspective:<p><ol>
<li>Think of taking your temperature like brushing your teeth: you do it without even thinking. The BBT is more convenient because you don't even have to get out of bed to do it.<p>
<li>Make BBT charting into a game. see which one of you can guess the day that your temperature will rise. The one who wins gets taken out to eat (at the other's expense, of course!).<p>
<li>If you are the analytical type, use your calculator or personal computer to calculate median temperature during the follicular phase, percent differ-ence to the luteal phase, and standard deviations. Where else could you find so much data to analyze?<p>
<li>Compare BBT charts at your fertility support group meetings. Award ribbons for those with the flattest line, for those with the highest midcycle temperature rise, and for those couples who had sex even during their infertile days.</ol>

<b>Urinary LH testing</b><br>
Although serum progesterone tests BBT's and endometrial biopsy can indicate whether you have ovulated, these do not help pinpoint the actual day of ovulation. The BBT is not helpfu to tell you when you need to have sex or have an insemination in any particular month. <p>
The urinary LH test is a test picks up the rise in LH that occurs about 24 hours before ovulation. While older kits required up to one hour to perform, newer tests are more accurate and can be performed in a few minutes. The test kit can be purchased without a prescription and can easily be carried in the woman's purse. <p>
Testing begins a few days before expected ovulation. If you cycles last 28 days I recommend testing start on cycle day 12. When the woman is taking clomiphene testing can start four days after the last pill is taken. The testing is best carried out mid to late morning (for most kits).  I ask my patients to save all the sticks so they can be compared from day to day, or they can be brought to the office if there is a question about when the surge really started. <p>
If the LH surge stick does not change color after about six days, I recommend checking an ultrasound or blood progesterone levels to make sure the surge was not missed. <p>

<b>Taking an Endometrial Biopsy
</b><br>
By examining a tiny piece of uterine tissue, I can evaluate how well prepared your uterus is to accept an embryo. I use the LH surge test and your menstrual history to time the biopsy one to three days before your next period begins. I will have mny patients call the office when they detect an LH surge.  We will schedule the surge 12-13 days later. I recommend avoiding intercourse durig the month the biopsy is scheduled or recommending that a blood pregnancy test be checked to insure that an early pregnancy won't be interrupted. <p>
With few rare exceptions (where the egg remains trapped in the follicle, a condition called luteinized unruptured follicle or immunologic abnormalities), a normal endometrial biopsy confirms that you are ovulating, that you have an adequate luteal phase, and that your uterine environment will support an embryo. I'll discuss more about the endometrial biopsy in <a href="ch19mb.html">chapter 19</a>.<p><p>
If a woman's menstrual cycle appears normal, I proceed down different diagnostic paths. However, if any of these test results look suspicious, I treat her as I would a woman with abnormal menstrual periods. Read on to learn how I diagnose menstrual abnormalities.<h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2><p>
