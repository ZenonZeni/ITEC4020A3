</HEAD>Donor Embryo Program
<BODY>The donor embryo program was established in 1990 with teh intent to provide embryos to patients that do not have the possibility of obtaining a pregnancy with their own gametes (eggs and sperm).  These embryos are donted anonymously to the Cooper Center for IVF with the full knowledge that they will be transferred to a couple or person for the purpose of making them pregnant.  If available, a medical history is obtained from the donating couple.
<p>
After consultation and recommendation by the physician, the patient should contact Ms. Jennifer Carlson, BA (609) 751-5575 for further information.
