<H2>If You Suspect Your Family Pet<BR> Has Been 
Exposed to Rabies
</H2>
</CENTER>
Rabies is a viral disease carried in an animal's saliva.  Humans and other animals can be infected through a cut or scratch, or through contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes. <P>  

The arctic fox strain of rabies (spread mainly by red foxes and skunks) has been present in Ontario for decades.  A strain new to Ontario, spread mainly by raccoons, could enter the province later this year.<P>

Dogs and cats often get into fights with wild animals.  If you witness a fight, or if your dog or cat comes home with injuries from a fight and you have reasons to believe it may have been bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, please adhere to the following "Do's and Don'ts"!:
