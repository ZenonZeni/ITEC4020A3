<P> Downing's MazdaSpeed Kudzu Mazda placed 25th in the race, June 16,
1996.  The drivers were Terada, Downing, and Freon.  The car was halted
for five hours in a pit stop at the 13th hour (the results indicate
"refuelling", but that doesn't make sense).

de Le Mans) on June 22-23, 1991, at the Sarthe circuit, Le Mans, France.
<A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> was the first Japanese winner of the
race, and the only winner with a rotary engine.  The winners (Johnny
Herbert, Bertrand Gachot, and Volker Weidler) drove 362 laps and 4923.2
km (3059.1 miles), 27.2 km ahead of the second place car.  The average
speed was 205.3 kph.  They lead from lap 320 to the end (the last three
hours).

allowed.

<P> The R 26B engine that won was normally aspirated and had four rotors
and three sequential spark plugs per rotor.  It produced 700 bhp at 9000
rpm and 62 mkg torque at 6500 rpm (448 lb-ft).  Fuel was electronically
injected and consumption was 51.881 liters per 100 km at an average
speed of 213.58 kph (excluding pit stops).  The air intakes had
continuously variable geometry controlled by the engine electronics.
The transmission had 5 speeds (full synchromesh) from a Porsche design
gearbox and a limited slip differential.

The Mazda 787B car weighed 830 kg (1831 lb).  The chassis was designed
by Nigel Stroud and the body was carbon fibre.  Wheelbase was 2.66 m by
1.53/1.50 m and overall size 4.78 by 1.99 m.  It had 18 in wheels,
ventilated carbon fibre brakes.  Tires were Dunlop 300-640x18 front and
