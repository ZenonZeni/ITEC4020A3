<H1>PF Merges Onto the Superhighway</H1>

<B>By Tim Barngrover</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
According to Advertising Age magazine, the words "information superhighway" and "Internet" were mentioned more than 10,000 times in major newspapers in 1994, a ten-fold increase over the previous year. People are certainly talking about electronic communications, but what does it all mean to you?<P>

Well, we believe that the Internet and specifically the more commercial segment called the World Wide Web, is destined to profoundly alter the way publishers disseminate information in the future. (Not that the Internet or other forms of digital communication will take the place of the printed word. Our intent is to use electronic publishing to expand upon and enhance our print products.) The real question is, is that future now or in a few years?<P>

We're betting on sooner rather than later. That is why we are introducing our ownWeb site called GardnerWeb (http://www.gardnerweb.com opening in early October). The beauty of the World Wide Web, in addition to its democratic anarchy and infinite amounts of information, is that it is constantly changing and growing. That's the way GardnerWeb will be too. Think of it as a work in progress -- improving, reacting to your needs, growing as the technology grows.<P>

GardnerWeb will be a repository for the newest and best of what is happening in the finishing (and metalworking) industries. Breaking stories, industry events, new product information, links to other companies, even technical books will be available at GardnerWeb.<P>

We would like to take this trip on the "I-way" with you. That is why we have included opportunities for you to give us feedback as a key component of GardnerWeb.<P>

We are excited about this new method for communicating with the readers of Products Finishing. But we also recognize that this is new for us, too. We might even make a mistake or two as "newbies" (those new to the Net) are prone to do. But that's the nature of trying something new. There may be bumps (and slow modems) on this cyber-highway, but they will smooth out over time.<P>

Oh, and by the way, GardnerWeb is not our only venture into digital media. You may have already heard of the IMTS 96 CD-ROM Preview and Agenda Planner we are producing in conjunction with AMT -- The Association for Manufacturing Technologies. It's aimed at making attendees at IMTS 96 better prepared and more organized than ever before. And keep your eyes on these pages over the next few months for additional news of other exciting CD-ROM products that you won't be able to live without.<P>

As we sometimes say around here, "It's gonna be nice." <B>PF</B>
