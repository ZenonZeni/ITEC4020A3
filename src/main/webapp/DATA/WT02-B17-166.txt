<h2>BioPower for Rural Development</h2>

<b>Project Summary</b>

<p>The "Biomass Power for Rural Development" initiative is a 
five-year, collaborative effort, between the U.S. Department of 
Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
structured under the "Energy partnerships for a Strong Economy" 
Program.  Through competitive procurements, this initiative aims 
to demonstrate and deploy integrated biomass power systems that are 
economically and environmentally viable and sustainable.  
Additionally, the projects selected through this procurement must 
provide significant rural economic benefits.

<p>It is the mutual intent of DOE and USDA to successfully 
demonstrate the integration of biomass feedstock production with 
advanced high-efficiency power conversion systems which will 
produce power at cost-competitive rates.  These demonstrations 
will validate the many benefits associated with deploying 
integrated biomass power technologies, including job creation 
(especially in rural areas), the introduction of alternative 
energy crops as a means to offset federal agricultural subsidy 
payments, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

<p><b>FY 1996 Products</b>

<p>Through this competitive solicitation, a minimum of 2 (and up to 
5) integrated biomass power projects will be initiated through 
50/50 cost-shared cooperative agreements with private sector 
partnerships.  These projects will be the first step in 
demonstrating the successful integration of biomass feedstock 
production with advanced power conversion technologies.  The 
plants will utilize environmentally and economically sustainable 
biomass feedstocks consisting of an appropriate mix of dedicated 
energy feedstocks and/or waste/residue resources.

<p><b>Payoffs</b>
<p>It is anticipated that by the year 2000, each of the proposed 
integrated bioenergy systems will be operational, paving the way 
for future large-scale implementation of these rural energy 
systems.  The beneifts include:

<p>
1)  Demonstration of integrated feedstock supply systems with 
advanced power conversion technologies;<br>
2)  Economic revitalization of rural America;<br>
3)  Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;<br>
4)  Improvements in biodiversity and ecological health; and<br>
5)  Creation of a U.S. industry with significant export potential.

<p><b>Status</b>

<p>
The competitive procurement "Biomass Power for Rural Development", 
Solicitation No. DE-PS36-95GO10052, was issued on December 14, 
1994.  Final proposals were received as of May 9, 1995.  This 
collaborative effort between DOE, USDA and industry will exploit 
near-term, niche market opportunities for integrated biomass 
feedstock conversion and power production systems.  All proposals 
submitted in response to this solicitation include details 
regarding the rural economic benefits to be provided by the 
proposed project.

<p>In the first phase of this solicitation, the proposers will 
develop detailed engineering plans for both the conversion 
technologies and the feestock supply systems.  They will also 
obtain all necessary environmental permits and authority to 
construct their facility prior to the second phase of the 
procurement, which will award development funds for the 
construction and operation of the successful projects.  Direct 
cost-share funding is provided through DOE, and indirect support 
through existing USDA crop production and set-aside programs.  The 
goal for 1995 is the award of several first-phase financial 
assistance packages to proposers.  In 1996, final awards to 
selected projects will be issued along with permission to 
proceed.

<p><b>Related Programs</b>

<p>The Biomass Power Program, which is under DOE's Office of 
Utility Technologies, addresses the technology validation and 
evaluation of biomass power systems, with the participation and 
resources of national laboratories and industry.  The Biofuels 
Program, which is under DOE' Office of Transportation 
Technologies, addresses the development of liquid fuels from 
biomass, with a strong emphasis on the use of biotechnology to 
produce ethanol from lignocellulosics (materials such as wood or 
grass).  The "Biomass Power for Rural  Development" project 
addresses the coproduction of both ethanol and electricity and 
will further goals of the DOE Biofuels Program, as well as the 
Biomass Power Program.  Interagency cooperation between DOE and 
USDA has greatly facilitated the near-term pursuit of viable, 
integrated biomass power systems.  This program will help DOE and 
USDA achieve the mutual goals of rural infrastructure development, 
job creation, and opportunities to reduce federal subsidies 
provided to agricultural markets.

<p><b>Vulnerabilities and Issues</b>

<p>Since this initiative is focused on the creation of integrated 
biomass production and technology development, there is a strong 
need for continuous commitment to enable a full crop cycle to be 
evaluated.  Support from the USDA initially is through 
administrative rule-making on the basis of the 1990 Farm Bill 
legislation.  During 1995, the next Farm Bill is up for 
negotiation.  For DOE's program to be effective and for there to 
be adequate possibilities for commercial acceptance and 
follow-through on the systems developed under this initiative, 
there needs to be an accommodation of bioenergy crops under the 
1995 Farm Bill.
