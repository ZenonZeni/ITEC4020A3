<h1>Centre for Geotechnical Research</h1>
The Centre was set up within the University of Sydney in August 1987
with the primary aim of promoting industry-university cooperation in
furthering knowledge in the theory and application of geotechnics and
geomechanics.
<P>
It comprises staff and laboratories from the following departments,
schools and groups:
<ul>
<li>Civil and Mining Engineering
<li>Geology and Geophysics
<li>Geography
<li>Soil Science
<li>Ocean Sciences
<li>Ocean Sciences Institute
<li>Coastal Studies Unit.
</ul>
The objectives of the Centre are:
<ul>
<li>to serve as a focus for research in geotechnics and geomechanics
within the University of Sydney,
<li>to undertake specialised research, investigation, consulting, and
testing work for industry and government organisations,
<li>to foster inter-disciplinary research and teaching and geotechnics
and geomechanics,
<li>to develop techniques and equipment for geotechnical testing,
<li>to disseminate technical information on geotechnics and
geomechanics to industry.
</ul>
