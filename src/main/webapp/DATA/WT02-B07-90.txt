<title>Gingrich Says CDA is a "clear violation of free speech rights"</title>
<p>
<p>
Gingrich made these remarks on June 20 1995 on a national 
television show, the Progress Report carried on National Empowerment 
Television during a discussion with Rep. Bob Walker (R-PA) and Progress 
and Freedom Foundation Chairman Jay Keyworth.
<p>
Gingrich said:
<p>
"I think that the Amendment you referred to by Senator Exon in the 
Senate will have no real meaning and have no real impact and in fact 
I don't think will survive. It is clearly a violation of free speech 
and it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each 
other. I don't agree with it and I don't think it is a serious way to 
discuss a serious issue, which is, how do you maintain the right of free 
speech for adults while also protecting children in a medium which is 
available to both? That's also frankly a problem with television and radio, 
and it's something that we have to wrestle with in a calm and mature way 
as a society. I think by offering a very badly thought out and not very 
productive amendment, if anything, that put the debate back a step."
