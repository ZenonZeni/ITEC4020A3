<H3>Chula Vista Hydrogen Bus Project</H3>

<br>
<b>City of Chula Vista Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus Project;<br>

Barbara Bamberger, Principal Contact, Environmental Resource 
Manager,<br> City of Chula Vista, California</b>
<p>
The City of Chula Vista, California, has undertaken a $6.34 million 
collaborative project to
demonstrate zero-emission transit buses powered by hydrogen fuel cells.  
One of the objectives of this project is to compare the performance of 
buses powered by hydrogen fuel cells with the performance of today's 
diesel engine buses; another objective is to demonstrate and test 
hydrogen fuel cell buses in a real-world environment.
<p>
The proton exchange membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cells used in each bus 
combine
hydrogen and oxygen to form water; an intermediate step in this reaction 
produces electrons for the electric current used to run the on-board 
motor that propels the bus.  The PEM fuel cells demonstrated in this 
project will produce electricity using molecular hydrogen fuel and 
ambient air as a source of oxygen, providing a zero- emissions power 
source.  The PEM fuel cells, supplied by Ballard Power Systems, are 
smaller versions of the hydrogen fuel cells developed for NASA for the 
space shuttle program.
<p>
The buses are to be New Flyer H40LF low-floor vehicles fitted with 
Ballard 275 HP fuel cells
in the place of an internal combustion engine.  The performance of these 
buses meets Federal
Transit Administration criteria.  Each bus can hold up to 60 passengers, 
is fueled by compressed hydrogen gas, and has a range of 250 miles.  The 
vehicles perform as well as or better than a diesel equivalent.  The 
project members hope to demonstrate and test at least three of these 
vehicles.
<p>
The project will also gather and report data on the following, among 
other statistics:  fuel cell engine performance, cost, and reliability; 
fuel consumption; operating costs; service miles; passengers; fare 
revenue; road calls; and complaints.  The PEM technology demonstrated in 
the project should be of interest to operators of centrally fueled fleets 
covered by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program under the 1990 Clean Air Act 
Amendments.
<p>
<b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b>
<p>
The City of Chula Vista has been obtaining funds and developing strategic 
partnerships for this project.  Current partners include the California 
Energy Commission, the State of California Legislature, the Department of 
Energy, the local Transit Development Agency, and Praxair, Inc., which 
will supply the hydrogen fuel and assist the city in developing a fueling 
facility. The City of Chula Vista is currently developing  a world wide 
web site. Please check back for future links.
