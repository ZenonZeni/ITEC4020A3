<title>Changes to Federal Obscenity Statutes Added by HR 1555</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<h2>House Approves New Unconstitutional Indecency Statute</h2>
<p>
In addition to passing the Cox/Wyden amendment on August 4, 1995, the House of Representatives also approved changes to existing federal crimial laws covering the distribution of obscenity. The amendments, incorporated as part of the "managers amendment" to the telecommunications reform bill (HR 1555), seek to clarify that current federal law applies to computer networks.
<p>
These new provisions are inconsistent with the Cox/Wyden amendment, and are opposed by several prominant members of both the House and Senate, including Representatives Cox and Wyden as well as Senators Leahy and Finegold.
<p>
CDT believes that these amendments are unconsitutional and overly broad. They would criminalize constitutionally protected speach and would make service providers laible merely for providing access to the Internet to a minor. CDT will work vigoursly to ensure that these provisions are removed from the final telecommunications reform bill.
<p>
Below are the statuates as amended by the House bill:
