<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Advantages of a Bundled 401(k) Plan</STRONG></FONT><P>

Has your company's 401(k) pension plan become difficult to manage?  It started out as a nice
idea, but
it has since grown into an administrative nightmare.  If so, why not consider going from an
"unbundled"
to a "bundled" plan design?<P>

If yours is a classic "unbundled" plan, chances are you're quarterbacking a diverse team of
outside
vendors: obtaining investment services from one vendor, recordkeeping from another, and plan
communications from yet a third, while your plan trustee involves yet still another contact. 
Or perhaps
you keep some services in-house, while outsourcing others.<P>

One problem:  It can be confusing and inefficient.  Your plan may have little, if any,
systems integration. 
As a plan sponsor, you may have to make several contacts to conduct plan changes or obtain
information.  Plus, because noboby is responsible for the entire plan, there may be limited
accountability among vendors.  Not only are errors more likely, but the task of sorting them
out will likely
fall back on your shoulders.<P>

A second problem:  It can be unnecessarily expensive.  Because you have hired separate
"experts" for
each component of your plan, you should expect to pay more. Each "expert" comes with its own
profit
margin requirements, which you will have to pay for.  Additionally, since you have to manage
the
different players, your retirement plan can divert precious resources away from the business
of
running
the business. <P>

An attractive alternative:  "bundling" your pension plan.  Bundling enables you to
consolidate, or
bundle, as many aspects of your pension plan under one vendor as you deem necessary.<P>

As a result, you can offer your employees a quality 401(k) plan, for instance, that can
reduce your
recordkeeping costs by as much as 50%; provide enhanced benefit flexibility and service for
participants and let your human resource people focus on human resource issues - not pension
plan
management.<P>

Ten good reasons to learn more about what a bundled plan can offer. Companies that have gone
to
bundled plans often enjoy...<P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI><STRONG>Enhanced overall flexibility and operational efficiency.  </STRONG><BR>
	While many companies elect to purchase turnkey, full-service bundling options, in today's
market
you can decide to "bundle" part of your plan, and keep a portion of your plan with other
providers.  For
instance, many service providers offer bundled programs that offer investment options from
multiple
fund managers.<P>
		What types of services can you expect from a bundled program?  Companies using New
York Life Benefit Services Company 401(k) Complete<SUP>&reg;</SUP> enjoy such services
as...<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

</UL>
	<LI><STRONG>Fully-integrated systems.</STRONG><BR>
	All aspects of your retirement plan are consolidated under one common source.  This
allows
for less
human intervention resulting in more accurate, streamlined administration.<P>

	<LI><STRONG>Streamlined, professional administrative services and

well as learn
about other investment options and make plan changes with one phone call.<P>

	<LI><STRONG>Investment flexibility.</STRONG><BR>
