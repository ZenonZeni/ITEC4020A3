It was showtime. As a burst of applause and the show's lively
theme music filled the room, television talk show host Maury Povich made
his entrance. He stopped center stage, stared into one of the cameras and
began sharing a story that instantly riveted the audience.
&quot;When we first met Diana Rosenfeld,&quot; Povich began, &quot;she needed
an oversized wheelchair and a freight elevator just to make it into our
studios.<p>

As a montage of video clips showed astonishing images of Diana struggling
to walk, he explained that she had once weighed even more: 641 pounds.<p><BR>
&quot;Just getting around had become a major production,&quot; Povich continued,
&quot;and she tried just about everything to lose weight. Diana was desperate.
She had to do something. Finally, she found the Lindora Clinic.  It was working.
Diana's last-ditch diet was paying off.&quot;
Povich briskly recapped her three previous visits on the show while powerful
photographs of a steadily shrinking Diana appeared on the studio monitors.
&quot;I remember Diana well when she was 641 pounds, 409 pounds and 316
pounds. I wonder what she looks like now? I haven't seen her since she came
to our studio today on this trip to New York. Now everyone let's please welcome, the new Diana Rosenfeld.&quot;<p>

On cue, Diana emerged. She looked radiant. More to the point, she looked
healthy! Povich shrieked with delight when a beaming Diana stopped mid-stage
and did a spontaneous twirl to show off her new body. As she confidently
strolled past her lifesize &quot;before&quot; picture and toward the host's
open arms, the audience sprang  to its feet.<p>

More than a few of the onlookers were moved to tears. I was one of them.
I couldn't help but remember the day I first met Diana. Was this animated,
vibrant woman standing on stage in a Manhattan television studio really
the same person who had struggled through our front door at the Lindora
Medical Clinics in Costa Mesa, California just three years earlier?<p>

Over the years, from my first job with Lindora as a 19-year-old medical
assistant through today in my present position as its president, I've met
thousands of overweight people. Diana was, without question, the largest
woman I had ever met. None of the clinicians at Lindora had ever worked
with anyone her size, but that was no reason for us not to. While a majority
of the people who do our medically supervised weight-control program want
to lose between 30 and 60 pounds, we had been successful in helping many
people lose between 100 and 250 pounds.<P>

At 641 pounds, Diana had two choices: to lose weight or die. Other doctors
and programs had declined to work with her, writing her off as a lost cause.
But we believed we could help her. We knew that Diana's goal to lose weight
was realistic and achievable. We also knew that our program, which has evolved
over 25 years with five million patient treatments, is scientifically sound
and would be safe and healthy for her. What's more, we knew that if she
followed it, it would generate the results she said she wanted. The only
unknown was whether Diana possessed the desire, commitment and level of
enthusiasm it takes to achieve any goal.<P>

She certainly did. As her weight melted away, Diana's spirits soared. She
soon became a goodwill ambassador for Lindora, sharing her success story
on television and radio shows all over the world. Her story appeared in
magazines and newspapers nationally and internationally. She was, as they
say, &quot;hot copy.&quot;<P>

</TABLE></CENTER><BR>
With each new television appearance or newspaper story, interest in Diana
and our weight-loss program escalated. Thousands of phone calls, some from
as far away as Japan, England and Egypt, flooded our switchboard. We even
received a call from one of the entertainment industry's best known stars,
wondering whether we'd consider opening our clinic near Beverly Hills earlier every morning so she could slip in and out undetected on her way to the studio.<P>

<CENTER><B>&quot;ANYTHING YOU CAN SEND ME IS MORE  THAN I HAVE NOW&quot;<BR></CENTER></B>
Stacks-sometimes bags-of &quot;fan mail&quot; arrived for Diana nearly every
day. Whether the letters were postmarked from Seattle or Shreveport, there
was a common thread in every one of their stories: a sense of hope that
if Diana could do it, they could, too. What people wanted, pure and simple,
was the program Diana used. &quot;Anything you can send me,&quot; wrote
a woman from Detroit, &quot;is more than I have now.&quot;<P>

While the enormous outpouring of interest was heartening, it was also frustrating.
Every letter and call reminded us that behind the statistics-60 millions
Americans are obese; one of every three adults in this country weighs more
than 20% above their ideal body weight-there are people searching for solutions.
But since our program was offered exclusively in a clinical setting, we
couldn't help anyone who couldn't visit one of our Southern California clinics.<P>

Or could we? Was it possible to take a complex program that was currently
being provided by trained nurses and doctors in our clinics and simplify
it without compromising safety, quality or results? It was essential not
only that people do the program safely and comfortably, but that they achieve
results comparable to those our patients had come to expect.<P>

<center><B>&quot;AT HOME BUT NOT ALONE&quot;<BR></center></B>
We launched a Lindora &quot;At Home But Not Alone&quot; program to explore
the possibilities. Over 12 months, we worked with men and women ranging
in age from 24 to 68. Some lived thousands of miles away. Each received
an instruction manual that was far less comprehensive than this book, along
with a package of support products that included audio tapes, a step counter,
vitamins and an assortment of medical-grade protein supplements to be used
in addition to a healthy menu of lean meats, vegetables and fruit. We monitored
their progress by telephone.<P>

Within nine months, the verdict was in. The program was a success. People
throughout the country were enjoying impressive results. Ron, a computer
programmer from Dumfries, Virginia, lost 102 pounds. Candice, a 24-year-old
hotel executive living in New York City, dropped 30 pounds. Stan, a Mississippi
newspaper editor, lost 49 pounds and recovered from major surgery faster
than his doctors expected.<P>

And then there was Tommy McGruder. In May, 1995, we received a call from
Mary Grady, a television news reporter from KCBS, the CBS affiliate in Los
Angeles. She explained that a man weighing more than 800 pounds had been
carried out of his house by eleven firefighters and taken to County USC
Hospital. He was in respiratory distress and was literally being crushed
to death by his excess weight.<p>

Grady, whose station had done several stories on Diana Rosenfeld wondered
if anything could be done for McGruder. Though he lived just a few miles
from our Inglewood clinic, McGruder had been bedridden for two years, unable
to walk. He would need to be treated through our &quot;At Home But Not Alone&quot;
program.<p>

On May 8, 1996, Tommy McGruder celebrated one year on the program. So far,
he has lost more than 450 pounds. Tommy's experience was yet another validation
that we had successfully developed a way to provide the at-home guidance
and support so many thousands of people had sought.<BR>
As you read this book, you won't be alone, either. While it cannot duplicate
the support that our patients receive from trained professionals in our
clinics, this book is your gateway to a number of valuable resources, including
Lindora's site on the World Wide Web, our monthly newsletter and our telephone
resource center, where you can call for answers to any questions you may
have along the way.<p>

<center><B>THE LEAN FOR LIFE ADVANTAGE</B><BR></center>
As you'll discover, <I>Lean for Life</I> is much more than a book about
how to lose weight. It's a book about change: changing the way you eat,
the way you look, the way you feel and the way you think. It's a comprehensive,
personalized program in which you'll discover how your self-image and your
relationship with food have led to the weight problem you've decided to
address. You will <I>gain</I> awareness as you <I>lose </I>weight. You'll
learn how to become Lean for Life. And most importantly, you'll learn how
to <I>stay</I> that way.<p>
While writing this book, we asked Lindora patients for suggestions. One
woman, a patient in our Laguna Hills clinic, was adamant: &quot;Spare me
a lot of theory. Just show me how to lose the weight and show me how to
keep it off!&quot;<p>
That's exactly what this book does. <I>Lean for Life</I> guides you through
a straight-forward, results-oriented program designed to help you lose weight
rapidly, safely and comfortably. One month from today, you can weigh 15
pounds less than you do right now-and you can re-do the weight-loss phase
of the program until you lose all the weight you want!<p>
<center><B>THE THREE PHASE APPROACH TO 
BECOMING - AND STAYING-LEAN FOR LIFE</B><BR></center>
The Lean for Life program is divided into three phases: Weight Loss, Metabolic
Adjustment and Lifetime Maintenance. You'll do all three phases while eating
healthy, nutritious,<I> real</I> food from the grocery store.<p>
&quot;Phase 1: Weight Loss&quot; lasts 28 days or less, depending on your
weight-loss goal. During Phase 1, you'll be limiting your calories and your
intake of carbohydrates-your body's primary energy source-so that your body
will rely on its alternate energy system, body fat, for energy. <p>

As anyone who has ever dieted knows,<I> losing</I> weight is only the first
step. The challenge is<I> keeping</I> it off, which is exactly what the
second phase of the program is designed to help you achieve.<BR>
After<I> each</I> four-week weight-loss series you choose to do, you will
move on to &quot;Phase 2: Metabolic Adjustment.&quot; During this 14-day
period, you'll be increasing your body's metabolism-the rate at which you
burn calories-by gradually adding selected foods to your eating plan. Phase
2 is structured to help you retain the results you've achieved during the
weight-loss phase. When done properly, you will adjust your metabolism<I>
without</I> experiencing a weight gain.<p>

<CENTER>THE BENEFITS OF THE  LEAN FOR LIFE PROGRAM<BR></CENTER></B>
If you've ever tried traditional dieting-and who hasn't?-you know what an
uphill struggle it can be. You think about food and are nagged by cravings.
You often feel sluggish or irritable. And if and when you<I> do</I> lose
weight, it's typically a slow, tedious process.<BR><p>
On the Lean for Life program, you'll lose weight rapidly, burning excess
body fat as fuel at the fastest rate possible while maintaining your lean
muscle mass. What's more, you'll have fewer cravings and feel less hungry,
less often. You'll experience increased energy and feel terrific!<P>

After you've lost all the weight you want to lose and have successfully
completed &quot;Phase 2: Metabolic Adjustment,&quot; you'll graduate to
&quot;Phase 3: Lifetime Maintenance.&quot; This is as vital to your success
as the two earlier phases of the program. During Phase 3, the goal is specific:
to adjust your setpoint so that you can begin to eat &quot;normally&quot;
without gaining weight.<p>

The eating plan and success strategies featured in this book have been refined
over time. Since 1971, we have worked exclusively with overweight people.
Lindora nurses and doctors have logged more than 5 million patient treatments.
This book represents what we've learned along the way, and presents it in
a daily format that's easy to follow and fun to do. As you move through
the program day-by-day, you'll experience for yourself how the knowledge,
awareness and skills you gain will support you in becoming-and staying-Lean
for Life!<B><p>
<center>A PERSONAL JOURNEY</B><BR></center>
 The beauty of the program is that for every success story as compelling
as Diana Rosenfeld's or Tommy McGruder's, there are thousands of people
just like you who have succeeded in losing 10, 25 or 50 pounds.<BR><p>
Throughout every page of this book, my goal is to be your guide, to lead
you on a journey that will be both enlightening and effective. During this
process, I'll share with you dozens of stories of people who were once where
you are now, wondering how to begin the program and what to expect.<BR>
At Lindora, we've learned much of what we know from the experience and stories
of real people. But there's one person's story that's especially close to
my heart. If it weren't for her, it's unlikely the Lindora program would
have ever existed.<p>
A few weeks after I first started working on this book, I was sitting at
my dining room table, surrounded by reference material. But rather than

What distinguishes those who succeed from those who don't? Over the years,
Dr. Marshall Stamper, founder of the Lindora Medical Clinics, has noted
that Lindora patients who succeed in losing weight-and maintaining their
weight loss-share a number of qualities that clearly contribute to their
success on the program. Do you possess those qualities? It's time to

research, I found myself staring out the window and thinking about my Grandma
Angie, the woman whose battle with obesity is what ultimately inspired my
father, Dr. Marshall B. Stamper, to begin what was to become Lindora Medical
Clinics.<p>

My grandmother was a bosomy, robust woman with a rich Southern drawl, a
big laugh and an even bigger heart. For as long as I could remember, she
had always been a very large woman. Once, when I couldn't have been more
than five or six years old, I was sitting on the bed as she undressed. I
had never seen her without a dress on, and I remember being mezmerized by
her mammoth thighs.<p>

I was too young at the time to appreciate the health risks associated with
carrying so many extra pounds, just as I was too young to really understand
where the pounds came from in the first place. Grandma Angie was a fabulous
cook and I loved watching her prepare one of her specialties-large, soft,
white pieces of fat fried in a heavy, blackened iron skillet. I can still
taste the crisp, bacony pieces of fat and the squares of fried bread that
she prepared in the leftover liquid fat.<p>

Unfortunately, not all my memories of my grandmother are as pleasant. One
Christmas Eve, several years later, the holiday spirit was shattered when
she nearly died of congestive heart failure resulting from obesity. I remember
feeling totally helpless as the ambulance pulled away, its shrill siren
fading into the night. Not too long after that, my grandmother died from
complications of obesity.<p>

I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE TOLL EXCESS WEIGHT CAN TAKE. I'M THE
GRANDDAUGHTER OF A WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO DIED TOO SOON BECAUSE
SHE ATE TOO MUCH. I'M THE DAUGHTER OF A MAN WHOSE PASSION FOR
HELPING OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT IN SHAPING
THE WAY I THINK ABOUT DIET, HEALTH AND FITNESS. I'M THE MOTHER
OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, DETERMINED TO RAISE HER WITH
A HEALTHY BODY-AND A HEALTHY BODY IMAGE-IN A CULTURE THAT REVERES
FRIGHTFULLY THIN MODELS AS THE FEMININE IDEAL. I'M ALSO SOMEONE
WHO LOST WEIGHT ON THE PROGRAM 25 YEARS AGO AND WHO CONTINUES TO PRACTICE ITS PRINCIPLES TO MAINTAIN MY WEIGHT TODAY.  I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND AM PROUD AND DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE IT WITH YOU. </B><P>
<HR><HR>
<FONT SIZE=4><CENTER><B> FACING THE  FEAR </B><BR></CENTER>

Fear of failure. It's the single most common reason for not starting a weight-loss
program. If you've ever dieted and not lost weight-or regained whatever
weight you did lose-some degree of apprehension is natural.<BR><p>
The question is how to deal with that fear. Will you manage it or will it
manage you? It's easy to let fear surface in the form of excuses: &quot;I'm
too stressed and busy to start anything new right now&quot; &quot;I always
gain it back anyway, so what's the point?&quot; &quot;I don't really feel
that bad.&quot; But will statements like these help you achieve your weight
loss goal?<P>
The Lean for Life program offers a rare opportunity for you to practice
life-management skills while losing weight. Take a few minutes to read several
of the &quot;Lean for Life Success Stories&quot; featured throughout the
book. You can be sure every one of these people experienced episodes of
fear and self-doubt along the way. And yet they did it. They were determined
to overcome the fear of failure in order to earn the pride of accomplishment.
They succeeded.<BR>
You can, too.<BR>
<HR><HR>

<BR><CENTER><B>CREATING YOUR OWN  SUCCESS STORY</B><BR></CENTER>
This book is a collaborative effort in the truest sense of the word. It's
not only a collaboration between me and the thousands of Lindora patients
and &quot;Team Lindora&quot; employees whose wisdom and personal experience
it reflects, but ultimately it's a collaboration between us. You. And me.
That's because Lean for Life is not simply a book you <I>read</I>.
It's a book you <I>do</I>. And until you make it come to life by doing
the program it provides, it's merely paragraphs on a page.<P>

The most important story has yet to be written.  It's yours.  Unlike a novel,
in which the author's imagination determines the fate of the main character,
how this book ends is ultimately up to <I>you</I>. It's your success
story--one you are about to create.<P>

The first step is turning the page.<BR>
