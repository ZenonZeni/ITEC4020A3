<h2 ALIGN=center> Hurdle Setbacks in Record Time</h2>

Accidents happen all the time. Some situations get blown out of proportion and require immediate attention to prevent serious consequences. Obviously, true emergencies must be handled immediately, which means pushing aside planned activities and rearranging schedules to take care of the emergency. <p>

<BR>

 Here's a game plan that is sure to carry your organization or yourself over temporary hurdles and back to normal business:<p>



<ul>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stay calm. Tell yourself, "I've solved more difficult problems under pressure. I can solve this one, too." Your calm, matter-of-fact acceptance of the situation and the assumption that it can be handled keep both you and others calm and able to bring the situation under control.
<BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Isolate the major consideration. When a crisis occurs, something will probably be lost as a result of the situation – either time, money, or materials. Decide what loss can be tolerated and what loss must be avoided. Isolate the root of the problem so you can immediately respond to the real issue. Your objective is to solve the problem and regain control without a crucial loss.
<BR>

<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Return conditions to normal as soon as possible. Make the suggestion, take the action, give the instructions, and let everything return to normal. The objective for leaders in crisis management is to take personal charge of the situation for only as long as you're needed.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Learn something from the situation. The handling of the crisis situation should have a direct contribution to crisis prevention in the future.<BR>

<BR>


</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Direct Your Life With a Positive Outlook </h2>

Disagreeable experiences of any kind – inconvenience, trouble, embarrassment, delays, loss, or unexpected effort – are triggers for negative emotions. But, to be effective, achievers must deal with their negative emotions and project a positive outlook in all situations. <p>

<BR>


Achievers set goals, dedicate themselves to achieving them, concentrate on using their strengths, and work to turn weaknesses into strengths. Combining their positive qualities, achievers form an overall frame of mind, or positive outlook, that enables them to triumph over negative emotions. <p>

<BR>


Through practice and repetition, you can develop positive habits of thinking just as you can develop positive habits of behavior. Your mind believes what you tell it, and your body receives directions from your mind. Tell yourself constantly that you can overcome negative emotions – your mind and body will obey you. By applying this truth in your life, you will be well on your way to possessing a positive mental outlook. <p>

<BR>


Communicate more useful, positive emotions when you're faced with negative situations by using these suggestions:<p>



<ul>

<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Honestly evaluate your present attitude. Get a clear picture of how you view yourself, others, and various situations. Identify attitudes you admire and those you would like to change. Then, set goals to make positive changes.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Note people and situations that cause negative emotions to surface. Decide in advance how you intend to think, feel and act when an undesirable situation occurs. Visualize yourself handling the situation positively. <BR>


<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Think before you act. Deliberately act the part as you've planned and visualized, regardless of how you feel at the moment. Resolve to keep a level head no matter what others say or do.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid harboring ill feelings. Realize that people have sufficient reasons for whatever they do or say at any given time. Try to be more understanding of others in negative situations.<BR>
<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dispose of regrets. Discard false hopes, drop impractical expectations, and identify and present new options for the future. Work with others to find positive solutions to problems.<BR>

<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Put small, everyday pains out of your mind. Keep your thoughts focused on accomplishing your goals instead of on the pressures and obstacles that stand between you and reaching your goals. Let your positive outlook on life direct you to overcome negative emotions that stand between you and the success you deserve.<BR>

<BR>

</ul>
