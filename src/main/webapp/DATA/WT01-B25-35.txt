<p>National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse </p>

<p>801 19th Street N.W. </p>

<p>Washington, D.C. 20006<br>
</p>

<p>March 22, 1972<br>
</p>

<p>To The President and Congress of the United States: </p>

<p>As Chairman of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse, I am pleased to submit to you our first year Report in
conformance with the mandate contained in Section 601 of Public
Law 91-513, The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
Act of 1970. </p>

<p>This Report &quot;Marihuana, A Signal of
Misunderstanding&quot; is an all-inclusive effort to present the
facts as they are known today, to demythologize the controversy
surrounding marihuana, and to place in proper perspective one of
the most emotional and explosive issues of our time. We on the
Commission sincerely hope it will play a significant role in
bringing uniformity and rationality to our marihuana laws, both
Federal and State, and that it will create a healthy climate for
further discussion, for further research and for a continuing
advance in the development of a public social policy beneficial
to all our citizens. </p>

<p>Whatever the facts are we have reported them. Wherever the
facts have logically led us, we have followed and used them in
reaching our recommendations. We hope this Report will be a
foundation upon which credibility in this area can be restored
and upon which a rational policy can be predicated. </p>

<p>By Direction of the Commission </p>

<p>Raymond P. Shafer </p>

<hr>

<p>The President </p>

<p>The President of the Senate </p>

<p>The Speaker of the House<br>
