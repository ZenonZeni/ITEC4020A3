The Company's commitment to helping communities in which it does business can be traced back
to
1853 when it made its first contribution -- assisting the victims of yellow fever in New
Orleans.<P>
The Company's first formal contributions budget was established in 1951.  Since then, the
Company and, subsequently, the New York Life Foundation -- which was created in 1979 and is
now the Company's main vehicle for charitable giving -- have contributed more than $63 million
to a variety of national and local organizations across the country.  Today, the New York
Life Foundation supports a wide range of health and human service agencies, educational
institutions, arts and cultural groups, as well as civic and community organizations. 
Periodically, the Foundation selects areas of special focus within one or more of these
categories.  Its current priority areas are AIDS and literacy.<P>
The Foundation makes annual grants to more than 150 United Ways across the country in cities
where New York Life offices are located.  In 1995, recipients of other major grants included
the National AIDS Fund, Literacy Volunteers of America, the Life and Health Insurance Medical
Research Fund, Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, and Literacy Volunteers of New York
City.<P>
New York Life doesn't view its contributions program as one that "gives away" money.  Grants
are made as investments in organizations whose work enhances the quality of life of the
people they serve, thus ensuring a better future for society as a whole.<P>

Frequently, the Foundation is able to combine its financial support with the Company's
greatest asset -- the talent and expertise of its people.  For example, the Foundation for
Independent Higher Education (FIHE), which represents 600 independent colleges across the
country through its 38 state and regional associations, has received more than $5.2
million in grants.  In many instances, this support has been coupled with the involvement of
Company officers, managing partners, and agents in both the national and local FIHE
organizations.<P>
Whether it's through the Foundation's matching gift program for colleges and universities, or
its Local Volunteer Action Program, which makes grants to community groups where New York
Life employees and agents volunteer their time, the New York Life family consistently
demonstrates its commitment to community participation.
