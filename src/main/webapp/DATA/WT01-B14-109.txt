<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>

<P>
<B>The Bank of France is a potentially interesting candidate for
revenue enhancement because it currently has one of the lowest
rates of profitability of all European central banks.</B>  Its
balance sheet has assets of $143 billion compared to $234 billion
for the Bundesbank, $193 billion for the Bank of Italy, and $114.5
billion for the Bank of Spain.  Yet, the after-tax profits of
the Bank of France were only $280 million during 1995 compared
to $7.6 billion for the Bundesbank, $443 million for the Bank
of Italy and $1.8 billion for the Bank of Spain.  Despite much
smaller balance sheets, the central banks of Holland, Britain
and Austria also produced much larger profits than the Bank of
France.
<P>
It is difficult to compare central banks across national borders
because of differences in their functions and responsibilities.
 The Federal Reserve, for example, employs 23,700 people because
it manages the U.S. check clearing system while the Bank of England
has turned over such functions to the private sector.  Some European
countries have their central banks engage in bank supervision
while others turn it over to independent agencies.  Some central
banks may also subsidize their commercial banks by undercharging
for certain services compared to the central banks of other countries.
<P>
The Bank of France could be a tempting target for rationalization
because it is so labor intensive (17,632 employees) in relation
to the size of the French economy and a recent study found that
the cost of producing bank notes is four times higher in France
than in Britain.  France also has not taken advantage of the new
gold leasing market developed by the Bank of England to obtain
rental income for its gold nor has it attempted to boost its profits
by realizing some of the large holding gains on its gold stock.
<P>
Before World War Two, many European central banks were owned by
private investors and thus had to be sensitive to investor pressure
for dividends.  Today, only two central banks still have private
shareholders, the Bank of Japan and the Bank for International
Settlements.  The Bank of Japan has almost 4,000 shareholders
who own about 49% of the bank's equity.  The stock rose sharply
during the late 1980's when the government was privatizing other
state enterprises but it then declined by nearly two thirds during
the 1990's Tokyo bear market.  As the Bank of Japan distributes
only 5 million yen of its 700 million yen of profits as dividends,
investors have lost interest in the stock and it now sells at
a 90% discount to book value.  The Bank of International Settlements
is a central bank for other central banks and trades on the Swiss
stock exchanges.  As it has a large portfolio of gold, its share
price often correlates with the gold price but its current share
price is still equal to only about one half of its potential asset
value.  After the nationalization of other central banks during
the late 1940's, issues such as shareholder accountability and
profitability ceased to be discussed.  But with many European
countries now moving towards monetary union it is difficult to
believe that governments will remain insensitive to the huge resources
which their central banks now have available to them.
<P>
The five central banks which will be at the core of monetary union
in 1997 (France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria) have collective
assets of $480 billion and 46,934 employees.  The five other European
countries which are strong candidates to join the EM by 2002 (Italy,
Finland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal) have an aggregate balance sheet
of $356 billion and employment of 22,291.  Hence if all nine banks
were to merge, they would have collective assets of $837 billion
and total employment of 69,225 compared to the Federal Reserve's
assets of $410 billion and employment of 23,727 and the Bank of
Japan's assets of $453 billion and employment of 6,300.
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the countries of Europe will continue
to have independent central banks with voting rights on the council
of the new European central bank.  These central banks will also
continue to have control over a large share of their countries
foreign exchange reserves.  But in view of the pressure for reducing
public sector deficits which exists in Europe today, it is difficult
to believe that the central banks of Europe can remain immune
to the fiscal austerity engulfing other government institutions.
<P>
In addition to rationalizing their central bank operations through
staff cuts, some European countries should consider introducing
radical changes in their systems of monetary control during the
transition to EMU in order to enhance investor confidence in their
convergence prospects.   <B>Estonia's monetary regime could provide
an interesting role model for countries in a long transition to
EMU, such as Italy, as well as for countries outside of  EMU which
want to maintain a strong exchange rate link  to the new European
currency.</B>  In 1992, Estonia established a currency board which
has evolved into one of the most successful monetary regimes in
the world.  At present, Estonia has nominal interest rates of
only 8-9% despite an inflation rate of 17-18% and a current account
deficit equal to 6-7% of GDP.  The central bank is also highly
profitable and employs only 300 people.  After adjusting for loan
loss reserves to offset bad debts purchased during the banking
crisis which followed independence, the Estonian central bank
should earn a profit of $15-20 million on an asset base of $650-700
million this year.  Countries such as Italy and Spain, which are
strongly committed to EMU but may not qualify until the early
years of the next century should give serious consideration to
converting their central banks into de facto currency boards linked
to the new European currency.  If the markets took the currency
board regime seriously, their interest rates would fall sharply
and thus accelerate the process of deficit reduction.  It is possible
that Spain and Portugal will be able to achieve sufficient deficit
reduction to qualify for EMU in 1997, but their odds of success
would improve if they introduced an interim monetary regimes which
enjoyed so much investor credibility that their interest rates
fell sharply during 1997 and 1998.  The ratio of public debt to
GDP in many European countries is now so high that it will be
difficult to achieve small fiscal deficits without large interest
rate declines.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, if the U.S. economy shows signs of
reviving to a growth rate in excess of 3.0% after the third quarter
slowdown, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates again.  Fed tightening could come as early as the
October 4th employment report or it could be delayed until the
mid-November FOMC meeting.  The buoyancy of consumer confidence
and the U.S. equity markets suggests that the third quarter slowdown
in final sales will be temporary but there is sufficient disagreement
about the outlook that the Federal Reserve will want confirmation
of resilient final demand before it tightens.  The French government
has been successful in selling its budget strategy to the markets
because investors had become so pessimistic about the prospects
for deficit reduction during the summer that they regarded the
new budget as a positive surprise.  But investor confidence in
the outlook for European monetary union could fade again if the
French economy stalls during the fourth quarter or there is widespread
public hostility to the government's fiscal austerity.  France
will have parliamentary elections in ealry 1998 and economic policy
will not remain static in the face of conitnuing recession.
