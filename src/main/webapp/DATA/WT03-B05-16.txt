Japan Securities Finance to ease mortgage requirements+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan Securities Finance Co. said Monday it will ease mortgage
requirements in bond trading to lessen the burden on borrowers,
effective Jan. 5.
     Japan's leading securities financing company said the assessment
value of collateral to be offered by borrowers will be lowered to 102%,
above market value from the present rate of at least 105%.
     The company said the decision is in line with deregulation
implemented by the Finance Ministry and the Japan Securities Dealers
Association.
     Osaka Securities Finance Co. will take a similar step, company
sources said.

Stock market rebound reflects gov't policy, says official+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The recent rebound in stock prices reflects the government's
economic and financial policy, Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke
Shinozawa said Thursday.
     The market must have responded to the Finance Ministry's policy
actions, especially to policy for liquidating ailing housing loan
companies, Shinozawa told a news conference.  ''That's very
welcome,'' he said.
     The key stock market gauge topped 20,000 Wednesday in Tokyo for
the first time since October last year.

Kankaku Securities to shut down L.A. branch+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese brokerage house Kankaku Securities Co. said Thursday
it will shut down its branch in Los Angeles at the end of this year
in line with its restructuring program.
     The Tokyo-based company said operations at the branch, with a
staff of two, will be transferred to the head office of its U.S. unit
in New York.
     The closure will reduce the company's overseas business bases to
nine -- five subsidiaries, one branch and three representative
offices.

Greater disclosure needed by firms listing on new mart++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     More information needs to be disclosed by firms looking to list
their shares on a newly created section of the over-the-counter
(OTC) stock trading market as these companies may be fast-growing
but also have poor management, industry sources said Thursday.
     In addition to greater disclosure, brokerages will need to be
more discerning and more responsible when underwriting the shares of
these companies listing on the ''frontier market,'' they said.
     Already, two out of 31 companies expected to be registered for
OTC trading launched in July, have gone bankrupt after twice
dishonoring bills.
     The firms -- a Tokyo-based water processing plant operator and a
Yokohama-based computer development company -- were included in the
31 firms designated by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) as subject to a new law designed to promote venture
businesses.
     The ministry is unfazed by the bankruptcy of the two firms.
''They are venture businesses, and some are apt to fail,'' one
ministry official said.
     The company failures make it only clear, however, that it is
difficult for the ordinary investor to predict the future of venture
businesses, and that more corporate data is necessary, industry
sources said.
     The frontier market was launched by the Japan Securities Dealers
Association with the aim of making it easier for entrepreneurial
companies to raise funds by relaxing the rules of stock registration.
     Next year, similar markets will be set up within the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and other domestic exchanges.

Levi Strauss Japan to pay 120 yen per share dividend+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Levi Strauss Japan K.K., the Japanese subsidiary of the world's
largest apparel maker, said Thursday it will pay a year-end dividend
of 120 yen per share for its business year ended in November.
     The Tokyo-based company said the payment will consist of a 42
yen regular dividend and a 78 yen special payout.
     The dividend ratio is 2.4 times the par value of 50 yen.
     The company said the dividend amount was decided by taking into
account a fair distribution of profits, including a share for
internal reserves.

Local gov'ts to issue 13% more bonds in FY' 96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's local governments plan to issue a record 18,110.3
billion yen worth of bonds in fiscal 1996, which begins next April
1, up 13.0% over the current year, the biggest-ever growth rate, the
Home Affairs Ministry said Monday.
     The funds will be used to cover residential tax reductions of
1,642.5 billion yen and to invest in 2,030.0 billion yen worth of
public works, the ministry said.
     The public debt accounts for 15.2% of the local governments'
combined expenditures, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous
year, it said.
     The public works to be jointly carried out by central and local
governments include 270 billion yen for reinforcing buildings for the
public use against a big earthquake like the Jan. 17 Kobe quake,
according to the ministry.

Speculators buy bankrupt Hyogo Bank shares on TSE+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The bankrupt Hyogo Bank topped the list of most active stocks
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday as speculators engaged in a
heavy ''money game,'' traders said.
     They said an estimated 12.8 million shares were traded despite
the bank's delisting, set for Jan. 29 next year, boosting the price
of its stock to 2.00 yen per share, double its Friday closing of 1.00
yen.
     Hyogo Bank's operations will be transferred to newly inaugurated
Midori Bank early next year.

Long-tern bank forecasts 2.3% economic growth in FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan forecast Tuesday that
Japan's economy will grow 2.3% in real gross national product (GDP)
terms in fiscal 1996, led by recovery of capital investment.
     The bank report, however, said the recovery will be moderate.
     ''The recovery itself will make the transition from reliance on
public investment in the first half to self-sustainable recovery led
by private-sector demand in the second half,'' it said.
     The bank said capital investment will improve and the previous
adverse influence caused by an investment slump which has held back
growth in recent years will be eliminated.
     Public investment will support the economy through the first
half of fiscal 1996 while consumption, which has been restrained,
will improve.
     The bank, however, said the recovery depends largely on how well
the transition from a recovery supported by public investment to one
supported by private demand can be managed in the latter half of the
fiscal year.
     It said Japan's current account surplus will continue to shrink,
declining to 97 billion dollars in fiscal 1996 from 113 billion
dollars in fiscal 1995 and 124 billion dollars in fiscal 1994.
     In fiscal 1995, which ends March 31, 1996, the strong yen will
limit growth to 1.2%, compared with a 0.5% rise in the preceding
year, the bank said.

BOJ to inspect New York units of several Japanese banks++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Bank of Japan said Tuesday it will complete a series of
emergency inspections of the New York branches of half of Japan's 21
major commercial banks by the spring of 1996.
     Earlier this month, the central bank inspected three of the New
York branches of some 10 Japanese banks selected for an emergency
inspection, the central bank said.
     BOJ inspectors have detected some defects in the three banks'
risk management, central bank officials said.
     The planned inspections are designed to prevent a recurrence of
an incident similar to the Daiwa Bank scandal, in which Daiwa's
senior management is charged with ordering a cover-up for the 1.1
billion dollar bond trading loss at its New York branch.
     As a result, Daiwa was ordered by the Federal Reserve Board to
get out of the United States by Feb. 2.
     The 10 banks selected by the central bank have a relatively high
dependence on overseas banking operations.  The 21 banks comprise 11
''city banks,'' three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks.
     In a parallel step, the central bank will increase by seven to
20 the number of banks whose overseas branches are obligated to
accept a triennial inspection of their financial records and risk
management systems by BOJ inspectors, the central bank said.
     Among Japan's 21 major commercial banks, only Nippon Trust Bank
will be exempt from the new obligation, it said.
     The triennial inspection will cover the Hong Kong branches of
these 20 banks, on top of the central bank's current requirement that
the banks' New York and London branches be subjected to its triennial
examination.
     The central bank will draw up by next spring a list of checkup
points for reference by inspectors, according to which the inspectors
will examine the commercial banks' financial records and risk
management systems.
     The Bank of Japan will also make the ''check list'' available to
financial institutions, it said.
     The announcement came as Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura
unveiled a set of measures to help Japanese banks strengthen their
risk management and auditing systems as a way to prevent questionable
financial deals as in the Daiwa Bank scandal.

Creditors to be lenient toward failed Hyogo Bank+

OSAKA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Creditors have offered to allow the bankrupt Hyogo Bank to
recover about 20% of its claims on 16 nonbanking affiliates which
have applied for liquidation, financial sources said Tuesday.
     The sources said the creditors plan to hold another meeting next
spring to adopt a final agreement on the dismantling of the 16
affiliates of Hyogo Bank.
     Normally, the founding banks are required to abandon all claims
on the dissolved nonbanking affiliates to take responsibility for
their failures.
     The sources said Hyogo Bank may be allowed to lay claim to
about 20% of about 292.7 billion yen worth of loans to the failed
affiliates whose total liabilities are estimated at 1,545.1 billion
yen.
     The nonbanks have asked creditors to give up as much as 80% of
their claims due to a sharp fall in property prices, they said.
     The balance will be settled over a period of about five years,
the sources said.

Norinchukin Bank to go into red, farm minister says+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Norinchukin Bank, the core institution for agricultural
cooperatives, will plunge into the red in fiscal 1995 in connection
with the planned liquidation of housing loan firms, the farm
minister said Tuesday.
     Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries Minister Hosei Norota told
a regular cabinet meeting that about 20 financial organs under the
Mutual Credit Fund Association of Agricultural Cooperatives will also
lose money because of the housing loan firm fiasco.
     Financial institutions affiliated to agricultural cooperatives
are major creditors of the home mortgage loan companies, seven of
which are to be liquidated under a government scheme.
     The government's plan calls for the farm-linked institutions to
shoulder only some 530 billion yen of the liquidation losses
amounting to 6.41 trillion yen.
     The farm ministry will study the matter from early next year,
Norota said.
     In the past three years, 325 billion yen has been furnished to
the housing loan companies by the agricultural institutions in the
form of cuts in interest payments, Norota said.
     The burden of the 530 billion yen would undermine the farm
financial institutions' business standing as their internal reserves
are extremely small and their profit margins are also small, Norota
said.
     If they are required to take an additional financial burden,
they can not survive, which would create credit turmoil in Japan, he
said.

Tokai Bank may issue preferred stock+

NAGOYA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Tokai Bank may issue preferred stock if the domestic stock
market recovers in order to increase funds on hand, the president of
the Nagoya-based major commercial bank said Tuesday.
     By issuing preferred shares, the bank aims to keep its
capital-adequacy ratio from deteriorating in writing off
nonperforming loans to moribund mortgage companies, Satoru Nishigaki
said at a press conference.
     Preferred stock is guaranteed priority over common stock in
the payment of dividends to shareholders.
     Commenting on rumors that Tokai Bank may absorb Chuo Trust and
Banking Co. which belongs to the Tokai Bank group, Nishigaki said
''There is no likelihood of Tokai absorbing Chuo Trust in the
near future.''
     He said Chuo Trust's management condition will not worsen so
much in writing off its bad loans to the mortgage companies as trust
banks are expected to be allowed to use their special reserve funds
for guaranteeing the principals of their trust assets, in order to
make up for losses resulting from the write-offs.

IC, paper makers to enjoy good business in '96+

NAGOYA, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Tokai Bank predicted Thursday that Japanese integrated circuit
(IC) and paper makers will continue to enjoy a good business
environment in 1996.
     The bank's ''industrial weather forecast'' described the outlook
for IC makers as clear and that of paper makers as fair.
     The company based its forecast on brisk demand for personal
computers and paper for computer handling manuals and merchandise
catalogs.
     The business environment will improve slightly for automobiles,
machine tools and retail industries due to restructuring of their
operations and recovery of consumer spending, the bank said.
     Conditions will worsen for home electrical appliances and
housing industries in view of a continuing production shift overseas
and declining housing starts, it said.

Daiwa's N.Y. branch ex-manager indicted on conspiracy++

NEW YORK, Dec. 27 Kyodo

     A former manager of the New York branch of Japan's Daiwa Bank,
was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on charges of
conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board by allegedly
assisting in a cover-up of 1.1 billion dollars in trading losses.
     The federal indictment against former branch manager Masahiro
Tsuda includes a charge of failure to report a felony.  If convicted,
he faces up to eight years in prison and a fine of 500,000 dollars.
     Tsuda was arrested and first brought up on charges Nov. 2, which
led to an indictment against Daiwa Bank and the closing of its 15
branches in the United States.
     Tsuda was freed on a 500,000 dollar bond and is scheduled to be
arraigned Jan. 4.
     Wednesday's indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in
Manhattan, replaces the original criminal complaint filed by the U.S.
Attorney's Office and further details Tsuda's alleged role in the
conspiracy.
     The charges describe how Tsuda allegedly concealed 1.1 billion
dollars in trading losses incurred by the branch's former executive
vice president, Toshihide Iguchi, through unauthorized trading in
U.S. securities over a 12-year period.
     Iguchi was arrested Sept. 23 and later pleaded guilty to fraud
and embezzlement charges, and is awaiting sentencing.
     The indictment alleges that Tsuda failed to report Iguchi's
crimes to the Fed between July, when he first learned about the
losses, and September.
     Tsuda's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, called the charges ''unwarranted
and unjustified.''
     ''Mr. Tsuda sought to be law abiding...and act consistently with
what his employer and the Japanese Ministry of Finance determined was
the only appropriate course here -- that a thorough investigation of
Iguchi's extraordinary trading loss be conducted before a report was
filed with U.S. regulators,'' Arkin said in a statement.
     According to the indictment, Tsuda met with Iguchi and other
senior managers to discuss ways of further concealing the losses.  It
said Tsuda considered a plan to hide the losses through a Cayman
Islands entity and asked an employee to figure out a way to
repurchase securities that Iguchi had sold so that it would appear
the losses had not occurred in New York.
     Prosecutors allege that Tsuda postponed an internal audit in
late August by ordering Iguchi to take a vacation so that the losses
would not be discovered.  Iguchi did not actually take a vacation but
actually went to Tsuda's apartment to meet with a small group of
managers to review all the records of his unauthorized trading and
reconstruct the trading losses, the indictment claims.
     The indictment alleges that two Daiwa employees repeatedly
warned Tsuda that the bank was required to report the loss to the
Fed but that Tsuda refused, telling them he would take full
responsibility if the matter was discovered.

Ex-Im Bank to extend 24 bil. yen loan to Ukraine+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Export-Import Bank of Japan signed agreements Thursday to
extend a 24 billion yen loan to the Republic of Ukraine to help
stabilize the country's economy, the government-financed bank said.
     The bank said 18 billion yen will be an ''untied'' loan, which
allows the recipient nation to purchase necessary goods and services
from not only Japan but other countries.
     The remaining 6 billion yen will be used to finance the
country's exports, the bank said.
     The loan is in line with an agreement reached at the Naples
summit of the Group of Seven major industrial nations in July 1994 to
provide Ukraine with a total of 4 billion dollars in loans, the bank
said.  Japan pledged to put up 200 million dollars of the total.

S and P lowers Fuji rating, revises Sakura, IBJ outlooks+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Prolonged concern over Japan's banking system, plagued by bad
loans, led Standard and Poor's on Thursday to lower the debt ratings
of Fuji Bank and revise downward its outlook for the ratings of
Sakura Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
     S and P put Fuji Bank's senior debt rating at A-minus in light
of ''the length and severity of the problems facing the Japanese
banking sector'' as well as ''the bank's large problem loans,'' the
Japanese arm of the U.S. credit rating agency said.
     The outlook for the long-term rating is negative because the
bank's asset value could face further erosion and it is uncertain
when the nation's banking environment will improve, the agency said.
     Meanwhile, S and P revised its outlook for the senior ratings of
the IBJ and Sakura Bank to ''negative'' from ''stable'' due mainly to
the impact of a planned write-off of their exposure to ailing
mortgage lenders, it said.
     Sakura's long-term debt is currently rated A-minus by the
agency, while the IBJ's has an A-plus rating.

Bank managements looking to freeze salaries next spring++

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The managements of major commercial banks are intending to head
off rises in employee salaries during wage negotiations next spring
in hopes of keeping operating costs down, industry sources said
Friday.
     In addition to the need to stay competitive in the increasingly
globalized financial markets, the industry's unprecented plan to
freeze salaries is spurred by public criticism that salaries at banks
are high in comparison with other industries, the sources said.
     Criticism about the salaries of bank workers arose after the
government decided to use 685 billion yen in taxpayers' money to help
liquidate seven financially strapped housing loan companies.
     As a result of writing off losses stemming from the liquidation
of the mortgage firms, some banks are likely to post unconsolidated
pretax losses for fiscal 1995 ending March next year.
     At the same time, however, net operating profits at the
commercial banks are likely to rise to an all-time high due to
record-low interest rates which have reduced fund-raising costs.
     Labor unions at the banks are expected to strongly oppose the
attempts to freeze salaries.  ''They should first cut the bonuses of
executives,'' one labor union official at a major commercial bank
said.
     The labor unions are nevertheless expected to negotiate for much
smaller wage hikes than in the previous year as consumer prices have
declined.  In 1995, the benchmark Tokyo consumer price index fell for
the first time since 1970, declining 0.3% from the preceding
year.
     During spring negotations this year, the labor unions asked for
a rise of 1.0% and finally settled for a 0.5% increase.

Budget investment plan shows 2nd lowest rise++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government endorsed the fiscal 1996 investment and loan
program Monday, calling for the second lowest rise ever against the
background of weak corporate cash demand and a trend toward limiting
the role of governmental corporations.
     The investment and loan program for fiscal 1996 was approved by
the cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama at an extraordinary
cabinet meeting Monday.  The program will be presented for approval
by the Diet at a regular parliamentary session starting in late
January.
     The government plan earmarks 40,533.7 billion yen for the core
general category of the investment and loan program for the year
beginning April 1, up 0.7% from the initial program for fiscal 1995.
     The figure was revised up 80.4 billion yen from the 40,453.3
billion yen in the Dec. 20 draft program after relevant government
ministries and agencies renegotiated it with the Finance Ministry to
restore their requests.
     Still, the growth represents the second lowest year-on-year
rise since the program started in fiscal 1953, following the 1.2%
fall in fiscal 1985, a Finance Ministry official said.
     The core program expanded 7.7% in fiscal 1994 and 2.1% in the
current fiscal year.
     Under the investment and loan program, often described as a
second state budget, funds raised from state-run postal savings and
insurance systems as well as public pension programs are invested in,
or lent to, government-affiliated corporations.
     The overall investment and loan program -- the core program
plus financial investment operations -- totals 49,124.7 billion yen,
up 1.9% from the initial program for the current fiscal year, which
envisaged a 0.7% growth.
     The increase compares with a draft 0.3% rise.  The upward
revision came mainly because allocations for financial investment
were raised to 8,591 billion yen, up 700 billion yen from the draft
stage.
     The 700 billion yen goes into the new account of a government
corporation managing postal insurance funds to bring the total
allocation for the account to 1.7 trillion yen.
     The portfolio was established in 1992 to invigorate sluggish
share prices.  The government earmarked 2 trillion yen for this
purpose in fiscal 1993, but the figure slid to 1.5 trillion yen
in fiscal 1994 from 1 trillion yen in fiscal 1995.
     ''The account chalked up a turnaround from recent declines
because of current stock market conditions,'' the official said.
     By project, the government earmarks 12,143.3 billion yen in the
core program for housing-related projects, up 1.2%.
     Housing Loan Corp. will receive 10,909.8 billion yen, up 2.6%,
to provide loans for 630,000 home purchases in fiscal 1996 as
envisaged in the government's five-year home construction scheme
beginning next fiscal year.
     The budget for projects related to small businesses falls 12.6%
to 5,506.6 billion yen after a 5.1% growth in fiscal 1995, the
ministry said.
     Allocations to the government-affiliated Small Business Finance
Corp. are down 27.3% to 1.87 trillion yen for the first decline
since fiscal 1986.  The allocation was raised 3.4% in the fiscal
1995 budget.
     The Finance Ministry said the lower allocation resulted from the
downtrend in corporate cash demand.
     But the decline also reflects falling demand for funds from
public corporations, with the fiscal investment and loan program rate
-- at which the government borrows money from postal savings and
other sources -- hovering above the private-sector long-term prime
lending rate.
     To develop social infrastructure to improve daily life, the
government allocates 8.73 trillion yen to local authorities, up 21.5%.
     Of the figure, 450.3 billion yen will go to providing water
services, up 12.6%, 1,495.2 billion yen will be spent on sewage
treatment, a rise of 12.9%, and 213.8 billion yen will be used to
build public housing units, up 26.5%.
     Some government-affiliated corporations have been criticized by
the private sector, which is demanding that the corporations should
do no more than supplement private-sector operations.
     Under these circumstances, Japan Development Bank, whose
operations are to be scaled back, will receive 1,434 billion yen from
the investment and loan program under the ministry draft, down 24.8%
from fiscal 1995.
     The Export-Import Bank of Japan will have its allocation reduced
by 17.1% to 1.07 trillion yen.
     Meanwhile, the government earmarks 402.7 billion yen for Social
Welfare and Medical Service Corp., up 19.4%, to step up loans for
building nursing homes and other facilities for the elderly under
its 10-year ''gold plan'' welfare policy.
     On the transportation front, the government allots 21.3 billion
yen to Kansai International Airport Co., up 153.6%.  Of that amount,
700 million yen will be used to start constructing more runways at
the airport, which serves Osaka and opened in September 1994.
     The government sets aside 1,004.7 billion yen for JNR Settlement
Corp., up 10.4%.
     The corporation is disposing of a 26 trillion yen debt incurred
by the former state-run Japanese National Railways (JNR) by selling
land and shares in the seven private rail companies into which JNR
was split when privatized in 1987.
     In October, the government called off its plan to seek a stock
listing for West Japan Railway Co., one of the seven privatized
railway firms, within the current fiscal year to avoid upsetting the
sluggish equity market.

Gov't plans 4,845.5 bil. yen defense budget for FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government Monday proposed allocation of 4,845.5 billion
yen for the defense budget in fiscal 1996 starting April 1, allowing
a 2.58% increase over the initial budget for the current fiscal year.
     The year-on-year increase is a sharp rise compared with the
35-year low of 0.855% in the current fiscal 1995 that had an initial
defense budget of 4,723.6 billion yen.
     The rate of the year-on-year increase expanded for the first
time in six years after rises of 0.9% in fiscal 1994, 1.95% in 1993,
3.8% in 1992, 5.45% in 1991 and 6.1% in 1990.
     The increase is largely due to the 6.1% jump, to 1,778.8
billion yen, in payments for equipment bought previously but to be
paid for in fiscal 1996, such as aegis ships and the airborne
warning and control system.
     Other than the due payments, the proposed budget is composed of
2,076 billion yen for personnel expenditures and 990.7 billion yen
for other general expenses.
     Because of the sharp rise in the due payments, the government
has made efforts to restrain the defense budget as much as possible,
a Finance Ministry official said.
     The proposed budget sets aside 835.2 billion yen in fresh
contracts, a major part of which will be paid in fiscal 1997 or
later, to procure hardware such as tanks, fighters and destroyers, a
1.2% rise over contracts for fiscal 1995.
     The sum for such equipment shows its first increase in six
years, but if the effect of the planned rise of the 3% consumption
tax to 5% is excluded, the 1996 figure for such equipment is 820
billion yen, or a year-on-year decrease of 0.6%, the official said.
     The fiscal 1996 hardware procurement contracts include those for
11 F-2 planes -- once called the FSX next-generation support fighter
-- four F-15 fighter interceptor planes, 18 tanks, a destroyer and a
submarine.
     Under the government plan, Japan's host-nation support in fiscal
1996 for U.S. forces stationed in Japan will cost 273.5 billion yen,
a 0.8% increase over the current fiscal budget.
     The sum includes costs to move a U.S. night landing practice
site from the Atsugi base in Kanagawa Prefecture to Iwojima Island in
the Pacific, aside from wages for Japanese employees at U.S. bases
and utility fees for U.S. military facilities.
     The budget plan also consists of 153.9 billion yen in
expenditures for residents around military bases, a 2.9% decrease
over the current fiscal year, such as soundproofing their houses,
85.4 billion yen for training, 6.8 billion yen to build a central
command control system in a new Defense Agency building, 2.7 billion
yen to establish a unified information headquarters, and 201 million
yen for security dialogue and related works with nearby countries.
     The proposal includes 139.8 billion yen in contracts for
research and development of new midrange surface-to-air guided
missiles and rescue flying boats, 440 million yen in contracts to
research the so-called theater missile defense system, and 146.1
billion yen in contracts to improve facilities for housing personnel.
     The planned budget expenditure accounts for 0.968% of Japan's
500.7 trillion yen gross national product (GNP) as estimated by the
government for fiscal 1996.
     The 1996 defense outlays are the first annual defense budget
under the fiscal 1996-2000 Midterm Defense Buildup Plan, which calls
for a total of 25.15 trillion yen in defense expenditures during the
period.

Gov't ministers to discuss 'jusen' issues Tue.+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Government ministers concerned will meet Tuesday to discuss
measures to dispose bad loans on the nation's seven ailing ''jusen''
housing loan companies and disclosure of information related to the
problem, Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka said Monday.
     The government is under fire over its plan to use 685 billion
yen under the fiscal 1996 budget to liquidate the companies, saddled
with huge problem loans during the asset-inflated bubble economy in
the late 1980s.
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told Monday's meeting of senior
officials from the government and the three ruling parties earlier in
the day his cabinet will try to gain public support for the use of
taxpayers' money, according to Deputy Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki
Sonoda said.
     The cabinet needs to provide various types of information to
the public rather than just making arguments, Sonoda quoted Murayama
as saying.
     Masajuro Shiokawa, chairman of the Executive Council of the
largest ruling coalition member Liberal Democratic Party, asked the
government to set timetables for the bad loan disposal under the
liquidation scheme of the seven ailing home mortgage companies,
announced last week.
     Takanobu Nagai, chairman of the Diet Administration Committee of
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which is led by Murayama, said that
before an ordinary Diet session convenes on Jan. 22, the parliament
will discuss whether to set up a special committee on the housing
loan problem.
     The House of Councillors hopes to discuss the matter on Jan. 17
during a Finance Committee meeting, said Hisamitsu Sugano, chairman
of the upper chamber Diet Administration Committee of the SDP.

Gov't adopts 75.1 tril. yen budget plan for FY '96++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government adopted a 75.1 trillion yen budget for fiscal
1996 on Monday, calling for issuing a record 21.03 trillion yen in
government bonds that will further tighten Japan's already strained
fiscal conditions.
     The draft general account budget for the fiscal year beginning
next April totals 75,104.9 billion yen, up 5.8% from the initial
budget for fiscal 1995.
     The draft budget, adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the
cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in the afternoon, will be
submitted to the ordinary Diet session that starts in late January.
     At a press conference after the meeting, Finance Minister
Masayoshi Takemura said, ''The government has compiled the fiscal
1996 budget, basically giving consideration to the Japanese economy
which remains at a standstill.''
     ''There is a wide gap between expenditures and tax revenues and
how to remove it will be a task for budget compilation in fiscal
1997,'' he said.
     To help shore up Japan's sluggish economy, the budget calls for
relatively high growth of 4.0% in overall expenditures related
to public works projects.  The government will continue income and
residential tax cuts for the third consecutive year.
     Growth in general operating expenditures as a whole, however,
will be limited to 2.4%, the second lowest growth since fiscal
1989.
     General operating expenditures -- general account spending minus
such obligatory costs as national debt-servicing costs and tax grants
to local governments -- are used to cover government policy measures.
     To make up for a huge revenue shortage stemming from a plunge
in tax revenues during the prolonged economic slump, the budget calls
for issuing a record 21,029 billion yen worth of government bonds,
including 11,998 billion yen in deficit-financing bonds, also a
record high.
     Despite budget-streamlining efforts, the 5.8% rise in total
budget size is the biggest in five years.
     This reflects a sharp increase in national debt-servicing costs
and the government's decision to use general account funds for the
planned liquidation of moribund housing loan companies.
     Under the fiscal 1996 budget, the government earmarks 1,145.2
billion yen for official development assistance, a major pillar of
Japan's international contributions.  But this represents the lowest
growth ever at 3.5%.
     The defense budget, the first under Japan's new medium-term
defense guidelines aimed at compact but effective forces, will rise
2.58% to 4,845.5 billion yen, for the first increase of the
growth rate in six years.  The rise stems from increased payments for
defense contracts concluded in the past.
     Social security spending will rise 2.6% to 14,287.9 billion
yen, placing emphasis on measures for the disabled and steps under
the so-called ''Gold Plan'' for the promotion of health and welfare
for senior citizens.
     While increases in many spending items are limited to low
levels, public works-related expenditures will rise 4.0% to 9,719.9
billion yen to help lift the sluggish economy.
     The total includes projects to be implemented with the proceeds
from sales of government-owned shares in Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp.
     The budget earmarks 758.8 billion yen for science and
technology, an exceptionally high growth of 10%, in a bid to promote
restructuring of Japan's economy.
     The budget allocates 685 billion yen to help cover losses
stemming from the liquidation of housing loan companies which have
huge bad loans.  The government calls the allocation an emergency
step to help stabilize the nation's financial system.
     National debt-servicing costs, meanwhile, will rise as much as
23.9% to 16,375.2 billion, partly because the Finance Ministry will
be forced to resume regular allocations from the general account to
the National Debt Consolidation Fund for the first time in four
years.
     The ministry suspended fixed-amount allocations to the special
account, which was created to secure fiscal resources for the
redemption of outstanding government bonds, from fiscal 1993 to
fiscal 1995, in a bid to reduce the apparent growth of budgetary
spending.
     Since a huge amount of government bonds is in the pipeline for
redemption, however, the ministry will disburse 3,479.7 billion yen
to the national debt-servicing allocations.
     Tax grants to local governments will increase 2.9% to 13,603.8
billion yen.
     On the revenue side, meanwhile, fiscal 1996 tax revenues are
estimated at 51,345 billion yen, down 2,386 billion yen from the
estimate in the initial fiscal 1995 budget.
     To bridge the gap between revenues and expenditures, the
government will raise a total of 21,029 billion yen by issuing new
government bonds, up sharply from 12,598 billion yen in the initial
fiscal 1995 budget.
     This will bring the ratio of government bonds to overall
revenue from 17.7% in fiscal 1995 to a 16-year high of 28.0% in
fiscal 1996 on an initial budget basis.
     The outstanding balance of government bonds will come to some
240 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1996, equivalent to as much as
49% of the nation's gross domestic product.

Fiscal reform should not mean tax hikes: Takemura++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said Monday that while it
is necessary to reform Japan's fiscal system, that should not be
immediately associated with the idea of a tax increase.
     ''Revenues and expenditures should be discussed as a package,''
Takemura said at a press conference held after the cabinet of Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama endorsed a draft fiscal 1996 budget.
     ''Fiscal reform needs to be dealt with in wholesale debates from
the standpoints of how the government should function and how the
public-sector economy should relate to people's lives,'' Takemura
said.
     Under the draft fiscal 1996 budget, the government will spend a
total of 75.1 trillion yen in the year beginning April 1, with
general operation expenditures -- the core spending category --
totaling 43.1 trillion yen.
     The budget calls for a third income and residential tax cut in
as many years, a 4% rise in public works spending, and an allocation
of 680 billion yen to help clean up the huge debts amassed by
mortgage lenders.
     ''The government had to compile a budget addressing the economy,
which is still at a precarious juncture after four years of
stagnation,'' Takemura said.
     However, to finance the budget, the government had to decide on
the issuance of deficit-covering bonds totaling 12 trillion yen, of
which 1.9 trillion yen worth will be used for tax cuts and will be
compensated for with a future consumption tax hike.
     Takemura said he hopes to come up with good ways to improve the
current budget formulation system under which the Finance Ministry
sets limits on spending items.
     ''Given the huge discrepancy of more than 10 trillion yen
between revenues and expenditures, it is necessary to review the
ceiling-based system,'' he said.
     On the housing loan fiasco, Takemura conceded there were points
that were ''difficult to understand'' in the process of drawing up a
government scheme to dispose of problem loans using taxpayers' money.
     ''The government failed to map out an overview of the program
before putting the plan under discussion,'' Takemura said.  ''It
needs to disclose as much information as possible to win a final
consensus on the program.''

Hashimoto rates high FY '96 budget for MITI+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     International Trade and Industry Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
said Monday the budget allocated to his ministry for fiscal 1996 was
''satisfactory'' in light of economic conditions.
     Hashimoto said the 9.4 billion yen gain in the budget was a
''fruitful'' result for the ministry.  He made the comments at a news
conference after the government approved the fiscal 1996 budget plan.
     MITI is earmarked 394.7 billion yen, excluding spending for
structural adjustment in the energy sector, in the year starting
April 1996, up from 385.3 billion under the fiscal 1995 budget.
     Hashimoto said he hopes the new budgetary allocation will help
ensure smooth growth in the long term.
     The budget will be put toward four priority areas -- promoting
scientific research and development, boosting information-related
technologies, providing assistance to financially fragile small firms
and taking comprehensive steps for the energy sector, Hashimoto said.
     Hashimoto also said on the day that massive issuances of
deficit-covering bonds was an inevitable step.
     Such a move will pose a problem in the future by shifting the
burden of refunding to future generations, he said.  But a ''powerful
remedy'' is needed now with tax revenues sinking due to the slumping
economy, he said.

     Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful Federation of
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said he ''appreciated'' the

administrative functions from Tokyo as it reflected the federation's
request.
     Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said he welcomed appropriations for the development of new
businesses and technologies.
     The structural change of Japanese industry is an urgent task, he
said.
     Meanwhile, Jiro Ushio, chairman of the Japan Association of
Corporate Executives (keizai Doyukai), urged the government to
drastically change the pattern of expenditures and distribution of
funds for public works projects.

Prosecutors reindict 2 key figures in huge loan scandal+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prosecutors reindicted the former head of the now-defunct Tokyo
Kyowa Credit Association and the sister of detained former Labor
Minister Toshio Yamaguchi on Monday on charges of breach of trust in
connection with a giant loan scandal.
     Harunori Takahashi, 50, and Yoshie Yamaguchi, 60, were indicted
on charges of arranging some 1.9 billion yen in illegal loans from
the failed credit union for Yamaguchi's company.
     The move brought to five the number of indictments against
Takahashi, the central figure in the huge loan scandal that has
rocked political and business circles in Japan over the last year.
     Takahashi and Yamaguchi were earlier indicted for a similar
illicit loan case involving another failed credit union, Anzen Credit
Bank.
     The two have already admitted they arranged the 1.9 billion yen
collateral-free loans from Tokyo Kyowa to a golf course development
firm run by Yamaguchi from June 1994 to December 1994, prosecution
sources said.
     With the new indictment, the total amount of illegal loans
Takahashi is alleged to have arranged from the two credit unions
reaches about 22.1 billion yen, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors
Office said.
     Toshio Yamaguchi, who was arrested Dec. 6, is likely to be
indicted on Wednesday on four charges -- breach of trust,
embezzlement, fraud and perjury, prosecution sources said.
     The detention period for the 55-year-old independent member of
the House of Representatives will expire Wednesday.
     He was arrested on suspicion of breach of trust for having
arranged 2.7 billion yen worth of illegal loans from the two failed
credit unions for a company run by his sister.
     Toshio Yamaguchi will also be charged with embezzling some 180
million yen from a foundation to which he had served as a director,
the sources said.  He allegedly used the money as collateral for
loans to companies run by his relatives, they said.
     He will also be indicted on charges of fraud to the tune of some
170 million yen from a university in Kumamoto Prefecture, southern
Japan, in connection with a failed scheme to build a university in
the United States, they said.
     The politician will also be slapped with charges of perjury for
his statements made to the Diet in June in connection with the loan
scandal, the sources said.
     The Diet filed an accusation of perjury with prosecutors against
Yamaguchi Dec. 15 for giving false testimony before a lower house
committee.
     In the testimony, Yamaguchi denied any involvement in arranging
illegal collateral-free loans from the two failed credit unions.
     Yamaguchi denies he is guilty of breach of trust.
     In a related development, tax authorities have discovered that
three companies run by Yamaguchi's 52-year-old brother Katsuto Nemoto
underreported incomes by at least 420 million yen, tax sources said
Monday.
     The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has already instructed the
companies to revise their tax reports, the sources said.

Ministers agree on steps to collect housing loans++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Cabinet ministers agreed Tuesday on steps toward collection of
bad loans held by housing loan companies which are to be liquidated
by using taxpayers' money.
     The ministers agreed to ask the home mortgage companies to
maintain claims against bad loans and to rigorously seek to collect
them.
     They also agreed that the housing loan firms should inform the
finance and justice ministries, prosecutors and police authorities of
problems concerning their bad loans.
     The ministers held the unofficial meeting in response to public
criticism of the government plan endorsed last week to use 685
billion yen from the fiscal 1996 budget to liquidate the mortgage
firms.
     Justice Minister Hiroshi Miyazawa, Finance Minister Masayoshi
Takemura, farm minister Hosei Norota, National Public Safety
Commission Chairman Takashi Fukaya and Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken
Nosaka agreed that the government should do everything possible to
collect the companies' loans, Nosaka said.
     They also agreed that information about the housing loan problem
should be made available to the public, he said.
     Under Tuesday's agreement, the Finance Ministry, in cooperation
with other ministries, will start work on the gathering and
disclosure of information on the housing loan problem, and on ways to
help with the collection of loans, Nosaka said.
     The ministers are likely to meet again on the issue later this
year or early next year, he added.
     The ministers also agreed on measures to improve the functioning
of the Deposit Insurance Corp. and the establishment of a new
loan-collecting vehicle to take over debts and claims of the housing
loan companies.
     The Finance Ministry is to submit a bill to revise related laws
to the next Diet session so that the Deposit Insurance Corp. can set
up a section with enough staff to instruct the new vehicle on the
collection of loans .
     The new vehicle will have a loan-collecting division with strong
enforcement power.  Lawyers and real estate specialists will
participate in its activities.
     Both the Deposit Insurance Corp. and the new vehicle are
expected to keep close contact with Justice Ministry, prosecutors and
police authorities.
     In a related development, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told
reporters he instructed the ministers to cooperate toward fulfilling
the people's expectations.

Jan. fund surplus to shrink on slow public lending++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Tuesday predicted a net fund surplus
in January will shrink below the year-earlier level because of
reduced interest revenue from public-sector lending.
     The net liquidity surplus will amount to 5.11 trillion yen, down
from a 6.22 trillion yen surplus posted a year before, the central
bank said.
     Public-sector loans continue to decrease, as their interest
rates remain higher than those by private financial institutions as a
result of a series of cuts in the central bank's official discount
rate to a record low 0.50% per annum.
     Less lending by public financial organizations like the
governmental Housing Loans Corp. has trimmed interest revenues in the
banking system, the central bank said, expecting the fund shortage to
total 428.0 billion yen in January against a surplus of 70.9 billion
yen a year earlier.

Detained ex-minister made huge bad loans by stock deals+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, facing impending
indictment on charges of four counts of crime, caused huge bad loans
through stock trading on funds withdrawn from a firm affiliated with
a central figure in an aggravated loan scandal, investigation
sources said Tuesday.
     Yamaguchi withdrew as much as 38 billion yen from a nonbank
financial unit belonging to the EIE International group headed by
Harunori Takahashi, former head of the failed Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association, the sources said.
     The 55-year-old independent member of the House of
Representatives funneled about 90% of the funds into stock
trading, resulting in uncollectable loans totaling some 13 billion
yen.
     The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is expected to
indict Yamaguchi on Wednesday, the day his detention period is set to
expire, on charges of breach of trust, embezzlement, fraud and
perjury.
     Yamaguchi was arrested Dec. 6 on suspicion of breach of trust by
having conspired with Takahashi and his sister, Yoshie Yamaguchi, to
arrange 2.7 billion yen worth of illegal loans from Tokyo Kyowa and
another failed credit union, Anzen Credit Bank, for the sister's
company.
     The amount of loans Yamaguchi withdrew through accounts of eight
companies and two foundations he was affiliated with from the EIE's
financial arm reached a peak of 38 billion yen in 1989, the sources
said.
     Yamaguchi used most of the borrowed funds for stock trading, but
the prices of shares Yamaguchi had invested in fell sharply in tandem
with an overall bearish market.
     To salvage Yamaguchi from the snowballing bad loans, the
financial unit sold part of his stocks it had held as collateral,
succeeding in cutting the outstanding bad loans to about 28 billion
yen by November 1990, the sources said.
     Yamaguchi claims he is not guilty of breach of trust.

Shinozawa vows to tighten surveillance system+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa said Thursday the
ministry will proceed with a proposed reform of its inspection and
surveillance system in a bid to prevent illicit financial operations
like the Daiwa Bank scandal.
     ''The Daiwa Bank case taught the ministry a lesson and it will
do its utmost to flesh out measures proposed to make its banking
policy more transparent,'' Shinozawa said at a press conference.
     His comment came after a former manager of the New York branch
of Daiwa Bank was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on
charges of conspiring to conceal huge bond trading losses from U.S.
regulators.
     The ministry's response to the scandal drew strong criticism at
home and abroad over its obscurity.
     It only reported the incident to the U.S. banking authorities
some six weeks after Daiwa Bank notified the ministry of the losses
at the New York branch.
     While declining to comment on the indictment of the former Daiwa
Bank manager, Shinozawa said the ministry will make clear the
relations between its banking administration and inspection
activities, in line with reform measures announced by Finance
Ministry Masayoshi Takemura.
     Takemura announced on a set of measures on Tuesday to strengthen
the ministry's inspection and surveillance system, calling for a
shift in its banking policy to one based on market principles from
the current system of so-called ''administrative guidance,'' which
has been criticized for its lack of transparency.

Nov. tax revenues rise for 1st time in 4 months++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japan's tax revenues rose from the year-earlier level for the
first time in four months in November, supported by growth in
corporate tax revenues, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
     Overall November revenues totaled 6,804.35 billion yen, up 1.9%,
the ministry said.
     But cumulative revenues for the first eight months of fiscal
1995 that ends next March 31 fell 2.7% to 25,793.37 billion yen,
accounting for only 48.1% of the government's current fiscal 1995
tax revenue target of 53,593 billion yen.
     Under a proposed third supplementary budget which reduces the
tax revenue target by 2,912 billion yen to 50,681 billion yen, the
ratio will come to 50.9%.
     ''Income tax revenues were sluggish, but this was more than
offset by an increase in corporate tax revenues with returns from
companies that closed interim account books at the end of
September,'' a ministry official said.
     Many major Japanese companies settle their interim accounts on
Sept. 30 and annual accounts on March 31.
     ''Compared with results for the year-earlier period, companies
posted relatively favorable earnings growth and this led to the rise
in corporate tax revenues,'' the official said.
     November corporate tax revenues rose 7.6% to 3,142.99 billion
yen, accounting for nearly half of the total revenue in the month,
the ministry said.
     Income tax revenues, however, fell 7.8% and totaled 1,602.82
billion yen, including 1,118.76 billion yen from withheld income
tax, down 6.8%, it said.
     Among other items, liquor tax revenues, mainly from September
sales, dropped 10.1% to 156.34 billion yen in reaction to a
high level a year earlier, the ministry said.
     Revenues from the securities transactions tax advanced 56.2% to
36.76 billion yen as securities transactions became more active
compared with a year before, it said.

Shinozawa's resignation reflects poor year for MOF+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The sudden year-end announcement by Administrative Vice Finance
Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa that he will resign early in the new year
reflects a series of incidents that have shaken the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) in 1995.
     The ministry has come under a storm of criticism over a string
of cases during the year, ranging from the bad loan issue at housing
loan companies and the huge loss cover-up at Daiwa Bank's New York
branch to the involvement of ministry bureaucrats in improper
activities.
     Unusually, much of this criticism has focused on the nature of
the ministry itself, which has always enjoyed the position of king of
the Japanese bureaucratic system.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura on Friday accepted
Shinozawa's offer to resign.  The ministry's top-ranking bureaucrat
will formally quit on Jan. 5 and be replaced by Tadashi Ogawa,
director general of the National Tax Administration Agency.
     Shinozawa said, ''I have decided to step down to let some fresh
air into the ministry with the start of 1996 at a time when the
morale of ministry officials has been shaken by a series of
incidents.''
     Shinozawa stresses he is not quitting to take responsibility for
the ministry's responses to any individual case.
     But observers said he had little choice but to resign to
demonstrate his responsibility as the top bureaucrat.
     Critics said the MOF's usual method of trying to put a lid on
scandals by reshuffling officials would intensify public distrust of
the ministry.
     The MOF's poor public reputation has increased with the
revelation of close relations between some of its officials and
Harunori Takahashi, the central figure in an illicit loan scandal
involving two now-defunct credit unions in Tokyo -- Tokyo Kyowa
Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank.
     The MOF has also angered the public by its decision to use
taxpayers' money to help liquidate housing loan companies saddled
with huge bad loans, without seeking to pursue the people
responsible.
     The ministry has further come under fire from the United States
for its slow response to the Daiwa Bank case.  The MOF reported the
incident to U.S. regulators only six weeks after Daiwa Bank notified
it of its huge bond trading losses at the New York branch.
     This sparked criticism that the MOF, perceived to have cozy
relations with industry, tried to collaborate with the bank to
conceal the incident.
     Katsuto Uchihashi, a commentator on economic issues, said,
''Shinozawa's resignation does not mean an end to the series of
scandals that took place this year.''
     ''It should be the real start of the ministry's reconstruction
by clarifying its responsibility as an organization,'' he said.
     Uchihashi pointed out that one of the most pressing issues is
how to change the concentration of power on the ministry.
     The MOF currently deals with fiscal issues, while keeping an
eye on the banking and securities industries.  Such a concentration
of power has been often blamed for the ministry's often insalubrious
relations with industry.
     Uchihashi also said that relations between politicians and
bureaucrats should be discussed as part of the ministry's reform
efforts.
     Politicians have to take the leadership in decision making and
stop simply accepting policy measures set by bureaucrats, he said.
     There have been growing calls for Takemura to take
responsibility for the bad loan issue at housing loan companies and
other financial scandals.
     Takemura, however, said he currently has no intention of
resigning.  ''It is my responsibility to proceed with the liquidation
scheme recently mapped out by the ministry for debt-ridden mortgage
loan lenders,'' he said.
     In a bid to fend off mounting criticism of the ministry,
Takemura earlier this week announced a set of measures to strengthen
the ministry's inspection and surveillance system.
     He called for a shift in the ministry's banking policy to a
transparent one based on market principles, saying the current system
based on the so-called ''administrative guidance'' is internationally
unacceptable because it lacks clear objective criteria.
     But many analysts cast doubt on the ministry's ability to give
up behind-the-scenes policy management and adopt a more transparent
profile.
     Given the ministry's way of dealing with the scandals simply by
accepting Shinozawa's resignation, it is doubtful whether the
bureaucrats are even conscious of the MOF's responsibility, they
said.

Teramura quits as adviser to banking group+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Nobuyuki Teramura, former chief of the Finance Ministry's
Banking Bureau, quit the post of adviser to the Federation of
Bankers Associations of Japan Friday, industry sources said.
     Teramura assumed the post of special adviser to the banking
industry group Sept. 1.
     The reason for his retirement is not clear but is apparently due
to the strong public criticism of the Finance Ministry's policy of
using taxpayers' money for liquidation of housing loan companies
saddled with huge nonperforming loans, the sources said.
     Commercial banks which have been asked by the ministry to
shoulder heavy financial burdens for the liquidation are also
harboring resentment against the ministry.
     Teramura was involved in the management of the housing lenders
when he was head of the Finance Ministry's Banking Bureau.
     His resignation was revealed through letters sent to member
banks of the banking federation.

Shinozawa's resignation surprises financial sector+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Financial circles were taken aback Friday by Vice Finance
Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa's offer to resign his post just before
the Diet begins grilling the Finance Ministry over its plan to use
taxpayers' money to help clean up bad loans at ailing Japanese
mortgage lenders.
     Shinozawa, the top Finance Ministry bureaucrat, tendered his
resignation to ''refresh the ministry's personnel and boost its
morale.''  He is widely suspected to have made the decision to take
responsibility for the mortgage debacle and a series of scandals
involving senior ministry officials.
     The news came completely out of the blue at the end of the year,
of all times, a top executive of a major commercial bank said.
     The banking industry had expected the ministry would keep its
battle array intact for the time being, given the prospect of stormy
parliamentary debate on the contentious scheme involving 685 billion
yen from state coffers to help offset a 6.4 trillion yen loss
stemming from the writing off of irrecoverable loans amassed by the
mortgage companies.
     Under the program, creditors of the housing loan firms will
forego irrecoverable loans, with recoverable bad loans and performing
assets transferred to a planned debt collection vehicle.  But the
ministry has yet to work out a way to make up for losses generated
when the vehicle fails to recover such loans.
     Banks which founded the housing lenders harbor animosity toward
the ministry because the program forces them to forgive all their
outstanding loans to the companies to compensate for 3.5 trillion yen
of the 6.4 trillion yen loss on irrecoverable loans.
     ''How could he step down without clarifying bureaucratic
responsibility for the mortgage fiasco?,'' an official at one of the
founder banks fumed, fearing the resignation might now deflect
criticism to the private sector when the Diet convenes early next
year to discuss the matter.
     Meanwhile, some bankers appreciated Shinozawa's decision, saying
it indicates the ministry's intention to grapple with the New Year's
tasks in a fresh environment after losing public confidence both at
home and abroad in 1995, which Shinozawa describes as ''the kind of
year we never want to have again.''
     On top of the mortgage problem, two senior officials were found
earlier this year to have had cozy relations with and received
benefits from people related to the failed Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association and Anzen Credit Bank that were implicated in illicit
lending.
     Hiroaki Taya, former chief of the Tokyo customs office, was
demoted from the position in March because he had traveled to Hong
Kong on a private jet owned by Harunori Takahashi, former head of
Tokyo Kyowa.  Taya is to retire Sunday.
     Yoshio Nakajima, former head of the Finance Ministry-affiliated
Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, resigned from his post in
July as he had signed a sales deal for imported health drinks with a
business consultant who was close to Tokyo Kyowa's Takahashi, and
pocketed some 60 million yen in cash from another acquaintance.
     On the international front, a bond trading loss scandal at Daiwa
Bank's New York branch pit the ministry against U.S. banking
authorities.
     Toshihide Iguchi, then a bond dealer at the branch, had incurred
losses of 1.1 billion dollars over 11 years through unauthorized
trading.  The ministry infuriated U.S. authorities when it informed
them about the case six weeks after learning of the losses.
     Shinozawa's resignation, however, had little impact on stock
pri final trading day of
the year.  Foreign exchange and other financial markets were also
unaffected.
     ''A reshuffle of top Finance Ministry officials will not make
any change in the overall picture,'' a stock dealer said calmly.
''It will neither spur nor dampen equity prices.''

Grain prices could double by 2010, daily says+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Greater consumption in the developing world could cause
international grain prices to double by 2010 from the 1992 level, a
national daily reported Monday, citing a report by the agriculture
ministry.
     In a front-page story, the Yomiuri Shimbun quoted the report on
the world's food supply-demand outlook as forecasting that prices for
wheat in 2010 could be 2.12 times the level of those in the base year
of 1992 and those for rice could show a 2.05-fold climb.
     The report by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries will be made public at a cabinet meeting Tuesday, the paper
said.
     Japan relies on imports for 70% of its total grain demand.
     Given that household spending is greatly affected by
international grain prices, the Japanese may not be able to satiate
themselves with rich food in the next century, the daily said.
     The ministry's report prepared two scenarios, the paper said.
One of the scenarios envisages growth in grain production slackening
to half the present level in the next decade, while the other allows
for grain yield per hectare remaining unchanged.
     Under the first scenario, international grain prices would rise
steadily, reflecting net growth in consumption in the developing
world due to a rise in population and stronger demand for feed grains.
     This would lift prices for wheat and rice by more than two
times, while maize prices would increase by 1.95 times and soybean
prices by 1.81 times, the daily said.
     Under the second scenario, growth rates for international grain
prices would be limited to 10 to 18% over the period.
     In either case, however, grain imports by developing countries
will expand, mirroring greater consumption due to rises in population
and incomes, the paper said.
     According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
annual growth in the world's per-hectare grain harvest slowed down to
2.1% in the 1980s from 3.1% in the 1960s.
     Annual growth in grain output slackened to 1.8% from 3.6%, the
FAO says.

Gov't calls for keeping food self-sufficiency rate+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The government Tuesday unveiled a policy of keeping
self-sufficiency rates for food at current levels until fiscal 2005.
     The cabinet endorsed the policy, which is intended to stem any
further decline in the food self-sufficiency rates, in a long-term
prospect on demand and production of agricultural products.
     The overall rate should be maintained at 44-46% toward
fiscal 2005 on a caloric basis compared with 46% for fiscal
1992, according to the policy.
     The policy calls for the farm sector to expand productivity in
the coming decade by stepping up infrastructure improvement programs
and technological development.
     It also proposed diversification of farm products and cost-
cutting efforts by means of large-scale farming.
     At Tuesday's press conference, Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Minister Hosei Norota said the policy will help stimulate
incentives for farmers in the future.
     The new prospect said Japan's food self-sufficiency rate would
decline to 41-42% if the current situation is left unattended.
     The policy said the self-sufficiency rate for grain should be
maintained at the current level of 28-29%.
     Rice self-sufficiency target rates in fiscal 2005 are set for
96-97%, almost unchanged from the present rate, while targets are
fixed at 12-15% for wheat and 5% for soybean, both up slightly from
current levels.

'95 commodity futures trading volume hits record high++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The combined volume of futures trading on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange for Industry in 1995 increased 15% over the previous year
to hit a record high of about 35.12 million contracts, the exchange
said Thursday.
     Rubber futures trading volume surged 58% to 14.28 million
contracts while platinum futures trading climbed 31% to 5.97 million.
     The heavy trading was attributable to wild price fluctuations
caused by unstable foreign exchange rates and bad weather in
rubber-producing areas in Southeast Asia, exchange officials said.
     Another major factor was a rapid influx of operating funds into
the commodities market due to unprecedented low interest rates, they
said.

G-7 to keep dollar strong in '96, dealers say+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The pledge by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries
to promote an ''orderly reversal'' of the dollar's excessive
weakness will probably keep the U.S. currency firm against the yen
in 1996, dealers and economists said.
     In addition, the dollar will be supported by the downward trend
in Japan's current account surplus as well as by increasing
investments in foreign currency-denominated bonds by Japanese
investors, they said.
     They said they expect the U.S. currency to move in a range of
95 yen to 115 yen during next year, compared with 79.75-104.70 yen in
1995, as of Dec. 25.
     ''Cooperation among G-7 nations to keep the dollar from plunging
will continue next year, preventing the dollar from sliding against
the yen,'' said Hirokazu Kawai, chief economist in the investment,
research and strategy division of Nikko Securities Co.
     His expectation stems from a joint statement issued after the
G-7 meeting Oct. 7, Kawai said.
     The statement said the G-7 finance ministers and central bank
governors ''welcomed the orderly reversal in the movements of major
currencies that began following their April meeting.''
     The October G-7 meeting took place against the background of the
dollar's rebound to just above 100 yen, a rise of about 20%
from April when the G-7 nations confirmed their support of the U.S.
currency.
     Therefore, there is little prospect of the dollar falling much
below the 95 yen line, given the possibility of coordinated
dollar-buying interventions by Japan, the United States and Germany,
said Kawai.
     ''The downward trend of Japan's current account surplus is
established and is preventing the U.S. currency from losing much
ground against the yen,'' said Akira Narumi, assistant general
manager of the foreign exchange division of Sakura Bank.
     According to the Ministry of Finance, the surplus in October
plunged 51.8% to 4.31 billion dollars, posting the second
straight month of falls from year-earlier levels.
     The fall is the sharpest since a 59.0% plunge registered
in November 1990.
     Moreover, the surplus during the April-September period
decreased 7.4% from a year before to 58.30 billion dollars,
the fourth consecutive half-year-term decline, the ministry said.
     As a result, the dollar might rise to the 115 yen level sometime
in 1996, exceeding the highest level for 1995 of 104.70 yen, which
was posted Sept. 20, Narumi of Sakura Bank said.
     Japan's investors, especially individuals, are expected to
continue going after higher-yielding foreign bonds, putting selling
pressure on the yen, said Takemi Kaneko, general manager at the
foreign exchange section of Marubeni Corp., a major trading house.
     The Finance Ministry's yen-curbing package adopted Aug. 2,
which eased regulations to promote overseas investment and loans by
Japanese investors, will contribute to the expansion of Japan's
foreign investment, Nikko Securities' Kawai said.
     The dollar's rise against the yen, however, is expected to be
limited, said Toshikimi Kaneki, an economist in the research
department of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.
     ''Fear that the gap between Japanese and U.S. market interest
rates might be reduced in the face of a slowdown in the U.S. economy
will weigh down the dollar's topside,'' Kaneki said.
     Furthermore, the dollar will probably be pressured by U.S.
efforts to balance the budget, which could lead to a decrease in the
number of Treasury bonds issued and thus to a possible reduction of
the rate gap between the two countries, he said.
     Lingering doubts about the planned creation of a common currency
for European Union member countries might continue keeping the dollar
from rising much against the yen or the German mark, Kawai said.
     That is because the persistent doubts may draw investors to the
mark, Europe's safe-haven currency, causing the yen to strengthen
against the dollar at the same time, he said.
     In 1995 in Tokyo, the dollar briefly plunged below the 80 yen
line April 19 to 79.75 yen, the lowest level since the modern
exchange rate system was established in the late 1940s.
     Later, however, a series of concerted dollar-buying
interventions by central banks, in addition to the Japanese
government's pump-priming economic package in September, pushed up
the U.S. currency, sending it to a high for 1995 of 104.70 yen Sept.
20.
     The Bank of Japan's accommodative credit policies, including the
cut in the official discount rate Sept. 8 to a record low of 0.5%
per annum, also contributed to the dollar's recovery to above
the 100 yen line.

Fisherman sentenced to 6.5-year jail term over gun trade+

SHIZUOKA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Japanese fisherman was sentenced to six and a half years in
jail at the Shizuoka District Court on Monday for masterminding
large-scale gun smuggling from South Africa for supply to crime
syndicates.
     Prosecutors had sought an eight-year prison term.
     Presiding Judge Katsutoshi Suzuki said in his ruling that
Hideaki Soga, 27, of Kagoshima, who worked aboard a tuna trawler,
''had sold almost all the guns, smuggled into Japan on an
unprecedented scale, to members of organized crime, who used the
weapons in crimes.''
     According to the ruling, Soga conspired with Hiroshi Irabu to
load a total of 191 pistols during a port call at Cape Town, South
Africa, and to land the weapons in Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture,
southwest of Tokyo, on Aug. 23, 1991.
     Irabu's trial in connection with the gun smuggling is still
pending at the court.

Auctioned imported rice prices sag to 262 yen per kg+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The wholesale price for two U.S.-grown rice brands dipped to an
average 262 yen per kilogram in this year's second auctions for
imported rice, organized by the Food Agency on Tuesday.
     The two brands are Akitakomachi and Koshihikari.  The two
high-grade brands were originally developed in Japan, but the seed
was exported to the United States to be grown by U.S. farmers for
sale back in Japan.
     The price of 262 yen was about two-thirds the average price the
same brands fetched at the first auction in July.
     Even after their prices are marked up by various middlemen and
distributors, these U.S. brands are expected to be priced at about
the same level as middle-grade domestically grown rice brands -- and
certainly lower than top-quality domestic brands -- when they are
offered on shelves at Japanese retail outlets, agency officials said.
     The lower prices materialized because the initial margin --
which a wholesaler must pay to the agency to win a contract to buy
the rice -- plunged to 150 yen per kg from 292 yen paid to the agency
in the first auction.
     The auctions are held under a special price-setting mechanism
devised by the agency after Japan agreed in 1993 to scrap its ban on
rice imports as a part of compromise arrangements under the Uruguay
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  At the
time Japan vowed to allow foreign rice a ''minimum access'' of 4% of
the domestic market of 10 million tons a year, starting in 1995.
     The new system allows the Food Agency to buy all the rice
imported by trading houses and to resell it to wholesalers,
effectively preventing distributors from bypassing the agency.
     Under the simultaneous buy and sell (SBS) system, the agency
requires competing pairs of importers and wholesalers to submit two
bids simultaneously, one for the price at which the importer plans to
sell rice to the agency and the second that at which the wholesaler
offers to buy the same rice cargo from the agency.
     The auction mechanism mandates that the agency award contracts
to pairs offering the best profits to the agency through maximization
of the gap between the two bids.
     The agency-devised system allows an importer-wholesaler pair to
offer bids differing by up to 292 yen per kg of rice.
     Now that the final retail prices of the two brands are expected
to drop to levels matching those of middle-grade rice brands as a
result of the latest auction, they are likely to be competitive with
various Japanese brands, industry sources said.
     Japanese wholesalers and retailers who purchased imported rice,
including the two U.S brands, from the agency at the first auction,
suffered sluggish sales because the official markup system forced
their retail prices up, the sources said.
     In view of the development, the agency increased the volume of
imported rice offered for bids at the second auction from 2,800 tons
in the first auction to 10,000 tons.
     Bidders applied to purchase a total of 23,194 tons of imported
rice.  The government allowed the auctioning of a total of 7,894 tons
of imported rices in accordance with its preset mandatory standards
on auction prices.
     As a result, the ratio of the aggregate volume of rice which
bidders applied to buy on the one hand to the volume of actually
auctioned rice on the other came to 2.3 -- a sharp drop from the
previous auction's 9.6, agency officials said.

FY '95 crude steel output to fall below 100 mil. tons+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's crude steel output in fiscal 1995 is projected to fall
below 100 million tons for the first time in two years, the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said Monday.
     In fiscal 1995, crude steel production is likely to reach 99.24
million tons, down 2.1% from the previous year, because output
in the January-March quarter is expected to fall 9.2% to 23.2
million tons.  Fiscal 1995 ends March 31, 1996.
     According to the ministry, crude steel production is likely to
hit 101.58 million tons in the 1995 calender year.
     While the number of workdays will decline in the January-March
quarter, the ministry said steelmakers will continue to be urged to
adjust inventories, which piled up in the April-September period for
reconstruction of Kobe and the vicinity hard hit by the Jan. 17
earthquake.
     In the January-March quarter, the ministry projects domestic
consumption of steel materials will drop 1.7% to 16.16 million
tons.

Steel wholesaler Hiuka Sangyo applies for bankruptcy+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A steel materials wholesaler under the aegis of world leading
steelmaker Nippon Steel Corp. virtually went bankrupt Thursday, with
debts estimated at 24 billion yen, a credit research agency said.
     Teikoku Databank said Hiuka Sangyo Co., based in Tokyo, applied
to the Tokyo District Court for voluntary bankruptcy.
     The agency said Hiuka Sangyo was established in May 1950 as a
steel materials wholesaler designated by two steelmakers -- Nippon
Steel and Fuji Steel.  Nippon Steel's corporate name was later changed
to Yawata Steel which merged with Fuji Steel into Nippon Steel Corp.
     The company's U.S. subsidiary, Hiuka America Corp., has
suspended operations since three of its executives were arrested
recently on suspicion of fraud for allegedly forging documents to
obtain a 4.5 billion yen loan, the agency said.
     Beside Nippon Steel, the company also had business ties with
other major steelmakers and general trading houses, it said.
     The company's sales amounted to 20.85 billion yen in the peak
year, which ended in January 1991, the agency said.

Nov. supermarket sales fall 0.2% from year earlier+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Sales at supermarkets across Japan in November edged down 0.2%
from a year earlier to 1.3 trillion yen, declining for the second
straight month, an industry group said Monday.
     The Japan Chain Stores Association said that although food sales
were slow, sales of most other items were good.
     ''It still is too early to say that consumer spending has turned
upward,'' an association official said.
     Food sales fell 2.4% from a year earlier to 579.07 billion yen.
     Sales of clothing gained 0.5% to 308.10 billion yen while
household goods sales increased 1.4% to 290.88 billion yen.
     Sales of men's clothes rose 1.1% to 69.695 billion yen but
sales of women's clothes shrank 1.1% to 97.00 billion yen.
     The association said sales of home electrical appliances gained
4.0% to 48.45 billion yen while drugs and cosmetics sales climbed
6.2% to 36.20 billion yen.
     Supermarket store sales turned sluggish for the last two months
after making an upturn in September.

Average Tokyo CPI in '95 down for first time++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The average consumer price index (CPI) in the Tokyo
metropolitan area in 1995 dropped 0.3% from the previous year for
the first time since such an index was introduced in 1970 as a means
to monitor price movements, the Management and Coordination Agency
said Tuesday.
     The agency said this year's overall average CPI for Tokyo's 23
ward area stood at 107.0 against a base of 100 for 1990, compared
with 107.3 registered in 1994.
     In the preceding three years, the overall CPI was up 1.9% in
1992, up 1.2% in 1993 and up 0.7% in 1994, it said.
     Consumer prices in Tokyo in December remained unchanged from
the previous month but were down 0.5% from a year earlier, with the
preliminary CPI standing at 106.7, the agency said.
     ''Consumer prices were extremely stable,'' said an agency
official.
     The year-on-year decrease came for the third straight month,
following a decline of 0.9% in November and 0.9% in October.
     The agency official said the smaller decline in December was
caused by smaller falls in the prices of fresh vegetables, which
fell 14.8% in December from a year earlier compared with November's
26.7% drop.
     Excluding volatile prices for perishable foods, the prices fell
0.1% from the previous month and remained unchanged from a year
before.
     In December, prices for fresh fruit dropped 11.5% from a year
earlier and those for durable consumer goods such as word processors
and videocassette recorders shrank 11.8%.
     On the other hand, prices rose 7.1% in transportation and 2.6%
in school tuitions, according to the agency.
     The agency said overall nationwide consumer prices slipped 0.7%
in November from a year earlier and fell 0.4% from the preceding
month, with the overall index standing at 106.8 against the base of
100 in 1990.
     The year-on-year decline was the largest since February 1987,
the agency said.
     The agency attributed the steep decline mainly to bigger falls
in fresh fruit prices.
     Excluding such perishables, however, the index came to 107.7,
up 0.1% from a year earlier and unchanged from the previous month,
the official said.
     He said he expects the average nationwide CPI for 1995 to show
a decline of about 0.1%, also the first decline since the agency
began announcing such an index in 1970, because Tokyo-area prices
are considered an early indicator of nationwide price trends.

Nov. unemployment rate hits record at 3.4%++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hit a record high
since 1953 of 3.4% in November, with the recent trend of higher
jobless rates among young workers continuing, the Management and
Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
     The previous official record high rate was 3.2%, registered
first in April and remaining until October, except for May's 3.1%,
as a result of the prolonged slump in the national economy.
     In a separate report released on the same day, the Labor
Ministry said the seasonally adjusted ratio of job offers to job
seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, rose fractionally in
November to 0.63 from the preceding month's 0.61.
     The reporting month's level compared with September's 0.60, the
lowest level since 1986 when the Japanese economy was hit hard by the
sudden appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar.
     However, the November rate means there were still only 63 job
offers for every 100 job seekers.
     The agency and the ministry said Japan's employment situation
remained severe in November and is unlikely to show notable
improvement immediately.
     In the unemployment report, the agency said there were a total
of 2.18 million unemployed people in November, up by 330,000 or
17.8% from a year earlier.
     The unemployment rate for men stood at a record high of 3.4%,
up 0.2 percentage point from the previous month, while that for
women was 3.3%, unchanged.
     An agency official said the unemployment rate climbed to a new
high probably because there were more people resuming job-hunting,
believing that the economy might pick up.
     Corporations, however, especially large ones, were not offering
many jobs, the official said, adding this left more people in the
situation of seeking jobs unsuccessfully at the time of the survey.
     The unemployment rate in the month was also boosted by the fact
that there were more people, particularly among young male workers,
who wanted to change jobs, the official added.
     The agency survey showed that the unemployment rate for male
workers in the 15-24 age bracket stood at 6.3%, up 1.1 point from a
year earlier.  The rate in the 25-34 age bracket was 3.5%, up 1.0
point, while that for the 35-44 age bracket was 2.2%, up 0.5 point.
     On the job seeker-offer ratio, the ministry said the number of
job offers during the month nudged up 0.5% from the previous month
for the second consecutive monthly rise, following a 2.6% increase
in October.
     The number of job seekers dropped by 1.6% from the previous
month, a turnaround from a 0.8% increase in October.
     By industry, job offers increased 7.4% from a year earlier in
the service business sector, 4.4% in the construction industry, and
4.1% in the wholesale, retail and food industries.
     Such offers dropped 4.8% in the manufacturing sector, while
they rose 3.2% in the transportation and telecommunication sector,
the ministry said.
     Behind the surge to a record high 3.4% in the jobless rate for
November lies a sharp increase in unemployment among younger
workers, private-sector analysts said.
     Many graduates face difficulties in finding jobs, affected by
corporate restructuring efforts which have led to a fall in the
hiring of new graduates, they said.
     They also noted a greater number of workers in their 20s are now
out of work because they find it hard to find new hoped-for jobs.
     Masatoshi Moriyama, a researcher at the Sanwa Research Institute
affiliated with Sanwa Bank, observed, ''There's a mismatch between
businesses which are seeking those who are useful immediately and
young workers who have left jobs to hunt for new jobs despite their
inadequate vocational ability.''
     Given persistent restructuring efforts among businesses, the
nation's unemployment rate will remain on a high plateau in the
months ahead, analysts say.
     The ratio of workers in their 20s who left jobs in the first
half of this year increased from a year earlier, according to Labor
Ministry figures.
     That ratio is taken by some analysts as a bright indication of
economic recovery.  They say the burgeoning economic comeback is
prompting young workers to enter the job-changing market.
     But Hiromichi Kinouchi, general manager for management and
planning at the Students' Assistance Association, said the rise in
unemployment among young workers stemmed largely from a drop in
hirings of new graduates and a larger number of workers who left jobs
under stronger restructuring pressure.
     ''Some of them easily left jobs as they are taken care of by
their parents,'' Kinouchi said.
     The higher jobless rate is also accounted for by the nation's
changing industrial structure, analysts said.
     Manufacturing-sector employment is following a downward pace due
to an increasing shift of production from domestic bases to overseas
while employment in the service sector is on the upswing.
     The service industries such as retailers, wholesalers and
restaurants are dominated by low-wage part-timers and moonlighters.
     ''While employment in the service industries is increasing,
their workers tend to leave jobs because of lower wages.  This in
turn results in a higher jobless rate,'' said Moriyama of the Sanwa
Research Institute.

EPA chief expects jobless rate to stay at 3% level+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's top economic planner said Tuesday the nation's
unemployment rate will likely stay at the 3% level for some time as
the economy struggles to pick up.
     Isamu Miyazaki, director general of the Economic Planning
Agency, said during a press conference that deterioration in the
jobless rate is ''often the case at the initial stage of economic
recovery.''
     Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hit a record high
of 3.4% in November, the Management and Coordination Agency said
earlier the day.
     Meanwhile, Miyazaki sounded optimistic about economic indicators
for October, due out later in the day.
     ''There are coming favorable figures, showing brightness in the
economy,'' Miyazaki said.

Labor minister calls jobless rate increase temporary+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Labor Minister Shinji Aoki said Tuesday the rise to a record
high 3.4% in the nation's jobless rate for November is a temporary
phenomenon in the current process of economic recovery.
     ''I have little choice but to take a serious view of the
unemployment figure,'' Aoki said at a press conference after a
regular cabinet meeting.
     ''But the jobless rate tends to rise temporarily in the course
of an economic pickup because such recovery encourages some young
workers to seek new jobs,'' he said.
     On the job seeker to offer ratio, Aoki said the rise of 0.5%
in the ratio for the month under review indicates that the
economy is picking up to some extent, although he said the recovery
is not strong enough.

Rengo urges gov't to call meeting on employment+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's biggest labor union urged the government Tuesday to
hold a meeting of business and labor union leaders as soon as
possible to discuss job-security measures.
     The eight million-member Japanese Trade Union Confederation
(Rengo) made the call in a statement issued after the Management and
Coordination Agency announced that the nation's jobless rate hit a
record high 3.4% in November.
     The organization said the government should make clear at the
meeting a policy of putting top priority on securing jobs.
     In order to avoid an unemployment crisis in Japan, it is
indispensable for the government, corporate management and labor
unions to introduce bold steps to secure employment, it said.

Organized workers hit postwar low of 23.8% in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The ratio of labor union members to employees slid for the 10th
straight year in 1995 to a postwar low of 23.8% as the number of
organized workers fell for the first time in six years, the Labor
Ministry said Tuesday.
     A ministry official attributed the decline chiefly to a shift in
the nation's industrial structure toward service-oriented industries
and a subsequent decline in workers in the manufacturing sector, who
are better organized than those in the services sector.
     The latest rato of organized labor, tallied on statistics made
available as of June 30, was 0.3 percentage point lower than last
year's, the ministry said.
     The number of union members fell by about 85,000 to an estimated
12.61 million, the first decline in six years, with the number of
unions themselves down 835 to 70,839, it said.
     By industry, the number of union members in the manufacturing
sector was the biggest, totaling 3.92 million and accounting for
about one-third of the total union members, the ministry said.
     Union members in the services sector came in second with 1.93
million, followed by those in the transport-telecommunications sector
with 1.62 million, it added.
     Among major labor organizations, the nation's largest, the
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), saw its membership slide
by 98,000 to 7.72 million, it said.

Winter bonuses up 1.9%, banks, insurers boycott poll+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Winter bonuses paid by leading private- sector companies this
year rose 1.9% over last year to a weighted average of 798,848 yen,
the Labor Ministry said Tuesday.
     The ministry said it was the second straight year of rises in
winter bonuses, showing improvement in corporate business performance
in the wake of restructuring and the downturn of the yen's value.
     The growth rate for last year stood at 0.1%.
     The ministry said the report was based on a poll taken on major
corporations, mostly those listed on stock exchanges, with 291
companies responding.  It has been conducting the survey since 1965.
     Four commercial banks and two insurance companies covered in the
poll continued to boycott the survey, disregarding a request for
cooperation, the ministry said.
     By industry, the ministry said bonuses paid by oil product
distributors and dealers showed the highest growth rate of 8.8% to
762,867 yen, reflecting brisk exports of petrochemical products to
Asian countries.
     In contrast, the construction industry posted a 16.9% fall to
1,253,606 yen due to the protracted real estate market slump, the
ministry said.

Nov. overtime work hours post 1st gain in 3 months+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Overtime hours worked in November at Japanese manufacturers
with 30 staff or more picked up from October's level for the first
monthly gain in three months, the Labor Ministry said Thursday.
     Manufacturing workers put in an average 14.0 hours of overtime
last month, up 2.9% from the previous month after seasonal
adjustments, the ministry said in a monthly report on labor
statistics.
     Overtime hours had shrank 0.8% in September and 0.5% in October.
     The figure also represents a 4.5% increase from the same month
a year earlier, compared with a 3.0% rise in October.
     Overtime work hours are widely counted as an indicator of
economic trends.  The growth for the reporting month came in line
with Wednesday's announcement of a 1.3% month-on-month pickup in
industrial output for November.
     Meanwhile, jobs at manufacturers with a workforce of 30 or more
totaled 7.78 million, down 2.3% from a year earlier and the largest
fall since October 1994, when the tally slid by the same margin, the
ministry said.
     Overall industrial employment contracted 0.8% year on year to
23.34 million, the ministry said.
     Service-sector jobs turned up 1.5% to 6.56 million, while
wholesalers, retailers and restaurateurs saw the number of workers
on their payrolls dip 1.0% to 3.55 million.
     Of the 7.78 million manufacturing jobs, 7.84% were part-time
positions, down 0.36 percentage point from November 1994. The
part-time ratio for industries overall stood at 11.81%, up 0.23
point.
     Monthly wages averaged 329,165 yen in the manufacturing sector,
down 1.0% year on year, and came to 296,095 yen overall, up 0.6%,
the ministry said.
     Inflation-adjusted pay gained 1.7% from a year earlier in the
manufacturing industry and rose 1.6% overall, the ministry said.

Labor, management at odds over small business workweek+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Labor and management remain at odds in a government panel
discussing whether to extend a moratorium designed to ease smaller
businesses into a 40-hour workweek set by the Labor Standards Law,
Labor Ministry sources said Thursday.
     The legal workweek was shortened to 40 hours in fiscal 1994.
But the law has allowed smaller businesses, which find it hard to cut
working hours due to labor shortages, to apply a 44-hour workweek on
condition that they shift to a 40-hour week in fiscal 1997.
     In a separate interim measure, minor enterprises in the commerce
sector and three other sectors are entitled to continue with a
46-hour workweek beyond fiscal 1997.
     While the Labor Ministry wants the panel -- the Central Labor
Standards Council -- to file a report by February, neither employers
nor employees are in the mood to climb down.  The report is not
likely to mention big reforms involving labor law revisions, the
sources said.
     Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the
three ruling parties, is poised to set up a task force early next
year to study an extension of the moratorium at a request of lobby
groups representing merchants and industrialists.
     The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), meanwhile,
adopted a resolution calling for full implementation of a 40-hour
workweek when they convened earlier this month to boost their morale
for ''spring offensive'' wage negotiations.
     The ministry, which will effectively compile the panel report,
hopes to achieve smaller businesses' transition to a 40-hour workweek
as planned.  ''Our stance is to make an effort to realize what has
been decided under the law,'' said Vice Labor Minister Kunihiko Saito.
     Given the yawning gap between labor and management, however, the
ministry suspects it will be difficult to guide arguments toward
presenting a bill to revise the labor law during the next regular
Diet session early next year, the sources said.

Employment of foreigners with skills on rise+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau approved the entry
into Japan of 6,564 foreigners in 1994 who planned to work in the
country using their skills, up 14 from the previous year, officials
said Thursday.
     The foreigners received permission to work in Japan as language
teachers, interpreters or other technical jobs, the officials said.
     The increase shows that foreigners with certain skills are not
affected by the country's prolonged economic slump, which is
deteriorating the domestic employment condition, they said.
     Of the total, the largest single group was 2,063 from the United
States, followed by 890 from Britain, 710 from Canada and 704 from
China.

Construction works head cases of local gov't corruption+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Some 30% of corruption cases discovered during fiscal 1994
among local government officials were related to public construction
works, a Home Affairs Ministry survey released Friday said.
     A total of 106 cases were discovered in the fiscal year from
April 1 1994 to March 31, 1995, representing a decrease of three from
the previous year, the ministry said.  Of these, 33 involved
construction projects.
     A total of 124 local government heads and officials were
implicated in the cases, down 11 from a year earlier, but the number
of local governments involved in the cases increased by two to 99.
     Of the 106, embezzlement accounted for 52 cases and graft 41.
     The cases included one in which a vice governor of Aichi
Prefecture was arrested in May last year for receiving 20 million yen
from a contractor in exchange for favorable treatment over a public
works project.

Homeless in Japan face hard times due to economy, cold+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Tokyo's homeless face a particularly grim few months now that
the metropolis is in the grip of winter.
     In an underground passageway used by thousands of people daily
near the western exit to Tokyo's busy Shinjuku Station stands a small
makeshift altar.
     It was placed beside a cardboard box whose former occupant, Jiro
Takahashi, 53, a homeless man and sometime poet, died a week ago from
hepatic cirrhosis.
     One of Takahashi's poems ironically became his own epitaph.
     ''Autumn's blossom, the Chinese bellflower has bloomed.
     ''To bloom and fall in underground passageways is a commonplace
in the world of people.''
     These days, Takahashi's colleagues pause to pay their respects
as they pass the altar.
     Sachiyo Ikeda and her group of some 30 volunteers who call
themselves the ''Shinjuku Egg Patrol'' regularly distribute boiled
eggs and other food to the occupants of the area's cardboard boxes.
     ''There are no people here who are homeless solely because they
like it,'' Ikeda said.  ''They all say they are here because they
have to stick with their friends, or because they can learn from the
more experienced ones.''
     The passageway is the future site of a moving walkway the
metropolitan government plans to install, but which homeless people
and welfare groups say is merely a way to get rid of them.
     The metropolitan government says it wants to move the 200 or so
homeless people now using the passageway to facilities it is building
on a reclaimed island on the edge of Tokyo Bay.
     Faced with continued complaints from pedestrians and owners of
shops near the passageway about the foul smell in the area, the
metropolitan government says the moving walkway must be installed and
that it is to assist elderly people.
     Toshiya Sasaki, a pastor with the United Church of Christ in
Japan and a member of a newly formed citizens' group working for the
homeless, said the numbers began to increase in Japan from 1990.
     That was the year when the so-called ''bubble economy'' began to
falter and opportunities for work in the construction industry
decreased.  Hardest hit were those 50 years and more.
     In August, the Tokyo metropolitan government claimed there were
some 3,300 homeless people in the 23 central wards in the metropolis.
     Local administrations and citizens' organizations familiar with
the problems of the homeless say there are an estimated 700 in
Shinjuku, and 200 in the Sanya area, a large concentration of cheap
flophouses for low-wage earners and unemployed people.
     Elsewhere, the homeless are a visible presence in and around
many of the larger stations like Shibuya and Ueno, where they can at
least stay warm and shelter from the elements during the day.
     In Osaka, the largest city in western Japan, the Airin quarter
in Nishinari Ward is currently home to about 150 homeless people
among the estimated 20,000 day workers there.
     There were twice as many homeless there this time a year ago.
     Police say the decline is attributable to increased employment
opportunities due to the recovery effort after the Jan. 17 Great
Hanshin Earthquake which devastated nearby Kobe and surrounding areas.
     But workers at a welfare center in the area say older homeless
and the sick still face the prospect of unemployment.
     Kawasaki which adjoins Tokyo's southern boundary in July
inaugurated a system of coupons which the homeless can exchange for a
daily meal.  The city has as many as 600 homeless.
     But residents near centers where the meals are supplied complain
that the homeless have begun settling in their neighborhoods.
     Sasaki said society's contradictions are encapsulated in the
problem of the homeless.
     ''They are not doing it because they are lazy,'' he said.  ''For
a start, the state and local bodies should adopt policies which give
them work.''

Corporate entertainment spending down 9%+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     In a sobering reminder of the nation's protracted economic
slump, Japanese companies spent less on entertainment expenses in
the year through January 1995 than the previous year for the second
straight year, official figures showed Tuesday.
     Japanese businesses spent an estimated 5,408.7 billion yen for
entertaining customers and business partners in the reporting year,
down 9.0% from a year earlier, the National Tax Administration
Agency reported.
     The agency surveyed tax reports by 61,365 companies nationwide
which closed their books between February 1994 and January 1995,
selected according to capital and business sectors.
     The total number of companies edged up 1.1% to 2.37 million,
but their total revenues fell 5.6% to 1,417.4 trillion yen.
     Corporate entertainment expenses dropped in the year through
January 1994 for the first time since 1961 to 5.95 trillion yen,
after peaking at a record 6.2 trillion yen the previous year.  The
agency started compiling such figures in 1961.
     In the latest year for which the statistics are available,
companies spent an average of 3.82 yen on entertainment for every
1,000 yen in operating profits, down 3.5% from the previous year.
     Companies capitalized at less than 10 million yen shelled out
7.63 yen, while those with capital of 1 billion yen or higher spent
2.28 yen.
     The construction industry topped the list of the most lavish
spenders on entertainment, followed by printing and publishing
enterprises and real estate firms.
     Expenditures on donations also dropped, for the third
consecutive year, by 8.9% to 477 billion yen.
     The most generous spenders were real estate companies, at 70.6
billion yen, followed by chemical producers and construction firms.

Firms pay 36,000 yen a month for transfers+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese companies pay on average 36,420 yen a month as a
special allowance to section chiefs who are transferred to local
branches and choose not to take their families with them, a private
research institute said Thursday.
     On top of this allowance, 21% of companies pay such workers a
sum for transportation enabling them to have family reunions twice a
month, and about half pay for such tickets once a month, the
Industrial Labor Research Institute said.
     Four percent of the 215 surveyed companies pay transportation
fees for family reunions only six times a year, according to the
survey.
     Asked why they could not take their family members to the new
locations, 63% of the workers said they did not want their children
to change schools.
     An institute researcher cited the difficulties faced by senior
high school students who accompany their parents to local cities of
finding schools with curricula corresponding to those of their
previous schools and that readily accept students who have not sat
Japan's usual yearly entrance examination.
     Fifty-eight percent of the surveyed workers said their elderly
parents who live with them refused to move to new communities.
     Forty percent replied they did so through reluctance to sell
their homes and buy new ones in local cities, the institute said.
     The companies said on average for transferred workers choosing
not to take their families with them, they give three days off
before they start at the new office.  However, 27% said they do not
give such time off.
     The average special allowance paid to senior managing directors
who are transferred to local offices was 40,275 yen, while that for
managers came to 39,143 yen, the institute said.
     Such allowances for rank-and-file employees came to 32,067 yen
on average, it said.
     Seventy-six percent of the companies said they continue to pay
these special allowances until the assignments come to an end.
Usually such assignments are for a period between two and five years,
the researcher said.
     The survey was conducted in September and October and included
66 large companies whose workforces exceed 1,000.

Yamazaki Baking expected to see lower pretax profit+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Yamazaki Baking Co. is expected to post an 8% fall in
unconsolidated pretax profit to 22 billion yen in the 1995 business
year ending Dec. 31 from the previous year for the second straight
year of decline, a business daily reported Friday.
     The top Japanese baking company's expected profit fall is
attributable to lower sales of bread and other products due to
intensified competition and increased distribution costs, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said.
     Overall sales for 1995, including rice products, are estimated
at 563 billion yen, up 3%, the daily said.
     For the 1996 business year, the company is likely to post a
pretax profit of 24 billion yen, up 10% from this year, due to a
streamlined distribution system, it said.
     Sales are also expected to rise 3% to 578 billion yen, the
daily said.

Microbrewers bubbling but local gov'ts still thirsting+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Private microbreweries have been making heady progress in the
market for local beers but local public bodies are having trouble
tapping into schemes to launch small-scale breweries to revitalize
their economies.
     In early December, the first nationwide festival of locally
brewed beer was held at the Tokyo International Fairgrounds.
     More than 15,000 beer fans rushed to the site during the
three-day festival to sample some 11 different beers presented by
local microbreweries in places ranging from Hokkaido to Okinawa
prefectures.
     The government's revision of the Liquor Tax Law last April eased
the license requirements for commercially brewing beer.
     The revision included lowering the minimum beer production
volume from 2,000 kiloliters a year to 60 kl, a measure which has
prompted a growing number of entrepreneurs, beer enthusiast groups
and even local governments to apply for permission to begin producing
local beers on their own.
     After issuing the first licenses to a Japanese sake maker in
Niigata Prefecture and a business group in Hokkaido in December last
year, the National Tax Administration Agency has granted 18 such
licenses to local breweries and provisional licenses to another six
within the first year.
     ''Private microbrewers which have started operations so far are
doing well in the business,'' said Tomoyasu Ishikawa, an organizer of
the first Tokyo local beer festival.
     ''The variety of tastes in such beer is one of the reasons for
its popularity.  Major beer brewers sell many brands that have quite
similar taste but with different labels,'' said Ishikawa, also an
official of Japan Travel Bureau's special team designated to support
private microbreweries.
     ''I think local beers will take root in the country in the
future, just like 'jizake' (locally brewed Japanese sake),'' Ishikawa
said.
     ''The boom in local beers is expected to continue for a while,
and the number of private microbrewers will grow to about 50 by the
end of next year and to about 100 within the next three years,'' said
Motoki Takahashi, an official at the microbrewery public relations
section of Sapporo Breweries Ltd.
     The nation's four giant breweries are all helping local
microbreweries launch their new businesses.
     Sapporo Breweries, Japan's third ranking brewer, has set up the
section to provide local makers with know-how on beer brewing and
beer hall management.
     ''We expect the local beers to stimulate the whole domestic beer
market, which has an annual production of 7 million kl and has
recently seen a slowdown in growth,'' he said.
     Kojiro Hagi at the Promotion Conference of Brewery, Community
and Package Proposal, a business group consisting of eight companies
including Itochu Corp., a giant trading house, established to offer
assistance to local public bodies, is taking a brighter view of the
future of microbreweries.
     ''In the United States, where local beers are quite popular,
such beer occupies about a 1% share of the overall beer market.
Supposing local beers grab the same share in Japan, and taking into
account the break-even point for microbrewers, there could be some
200 to 300 (such breweries) within five years,'' Hagi said.
     In contrast with the solid start by private microbrewers, local
public bodies are facing difficulties getting into the business.
     ''Though many local governments have a keen interest in beer
brewing, not even one has applied for a license,'' Hagi said.
     One of the major obstacles public entities face is the
difficulty of securing a consensus within an assembly to break into
the business, Hagi explained.
     ''A business plan often develops into a political issue in a
local assembly and gets scrapped in the end,'' said Hagi, citing a
case in the town of Kubokawa, Kochi Prefecture, where the local
assembly voted down a 376 million yen brewery construction plan
proposed by the town last March.
     The city of Sanda, in Hyogo Prefecture, is another typical
example.
     As Sanda is the birthplace of Komin Kawamoto, a Japanese scholar
of Dutch studies who introduced beer during the Edo period in the
19th century, city authorities had planned to set up a semiprivate
brewery and produce an original beer to attract more tourists.
     The plan, however, is still pending and the prospects for
launching the business have lost a lot of fizz.
     ''Concern over profitability prevented the local community from
coming to a consensus.  It is difficult for the city to pour tax
revenues into a business for which profits are uncertain,'' said an
official at Sanda city hall.
     ''The rejection by Kubokawa's local assembly also affected our
decision to suspend the plan,'' he added.
     The official said the central government should take some
measures, such as a liquor tax cut, to help local public entities
trying to launch breweries to stimulate local economies.
     Hagi's group is currently providing consulting services to five
local governments still hoping to tap into the beer business.
     Hagi said, however, that it would be the middle of next year at
the earliest before any local government-affiliated microbrewery
tries its hand in the market.

Budget holds ODA spending to record low 3.5% growth+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government Monday approved a 1,145.2 billion yen budget for
foreign aid in fiscal 1996, with its growth restricted to a record
low of 3.5%.
     The rate of growth is the lowest since the government started
allocating budgets for foreign aid or official development
assistance (ODA) in 1976.  The previous low was the 4.0% increase
allowed in the current fiscal year ending March 31.
     It is the third consecutive year since fiscal 1994 for the
growth of the ODA element in the national budget to hit an all-time
low.
     The low rate of increase in the overseas aid budget is largely
attributable to the nation's severe fiscal condition and the need for
the growth of the overall budget to be curbed, government officials
say.
     The cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama gave its stamp
of approval to the ODA outlay, contained in the overall general
account budget for the next fiscal year.  The overall budget will be
submitted to a regular parliamentary session expected to open Jan. 22.
     The proposed ODA spending makes it look likely that Japan will
not achieve its fifth medium-term target of disbursing 70-75 billion
dollars in aid to the developing world between 1993 and 1997.
     Japan remained the world's top foreign aid donor in terms of
total amount for the fourth consecutive year in 1994, disbursing
13.24 billion dollars.  The United States ranked second with 9.85
billion dollars, followed by France with 8.45 billion dollars.
     In its budgetary request for fiscal 1996, the Foreign Ministry,
along with other government ministries and agencies, sought a 7.3%
rise in ODA spending, arguing that a high growth rate is necessary
to accomplish the five-year target.
     The government paid out 1.1 billion dollars in foreign aid in
1993 and 1.3 billion dollars in 1994, a slower pace of disbursement
than hoped for, according to Foreign Ministry officials.
     In the breakdown of the next fiscal year's ODA spending, the
government set aside 277.3 billion yen for bilateral grant aid, up
1.8% over the current fiscal year.
     Of the sum, the budget for small-scale ''grassroots''
grant-in-aid amounted to 4.5 billion yen, up 50.0%, in view of the
need to meet a wide variety of local demands and to promote
cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
     The government also set aside 1.5 billion yen for fresh
emergency grant aid projects to help rehabilitate war-devastated
areas such as former Yugoslavia and some African countries.
     The ODA budget calls for a 5.7% rise to 348.5 billion yen in
bilateral technical cooperation funds.
     Such funds will be used for, among other things, inviting and
training students, engineers and researchers from developing
countries.
     As part of technical assistance, 1 billion yen is set aside for
subsidies to NGOs, up 31.6% from the initial budget for the current
fiscal year.
     The ODA budget recommends that low-interest yen loans, a key
component of Japan's ODA program, be increased 2.1% to 390.7 billion
yen.
     The proposal also included 76.3 million yen for new programs to
tackle global issues as part of the ''common agenda'' of Japan and
the U.S.
     The government also proposed 8.6 billion yen, up 5.0%, for the
''Peace, Friendship and Exchange Initiative'' to promote exchanges
between Japan and its Asian neighbors.
     The 10-year, 100 billion yen project was started in the current
fiscal year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World
War II and express the nation's remorse for its wrongdoing before and
during the war.
     The government allocated 2 million dollars worth of assistance
to women in developing countries, up 100%, and 390 million yen for
programs of the Foreign Ministry-affiliated Japan International
Cooperation Agency to tackle population problems and AIDS, up 66.6%.
     The budget proposal also calls for 4.1 million dollars for U.N.
efforts to expand women's roles in society, up 96.2%, 6.7 million
dollars for U.N. efforts to control drugs, up 11.7%, and 1.2 million
dollars to help the United Nations protect human rights, up 9.1%.

Cambodian resident in Japan gets award for education aid+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Cambodian resident in Japan has been given an award by King
Norodom Sihanouk for his contribution to reconstructing the
education system in Cambodia, wrecked during the 1975-1979 Khmer
Rouge communist regime of Pol Pot, his Japanese supporters said
Monday.
     Kong Vorn, 58, of Yokohama, received a first class medal for
national construction earlier this month.
     Kong Vorn had filed news reports for Kyodo News Service from
Phnom Penh until the last moment the Cambodian capital was taken over
by the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975.
     Although he was forced to work in rural area by the Khmer Rouge,
he managed to escape from so-called ''killing field'' to his home
town in Prey Veng Province on Cambodian-Vietnam border and hid there
until the Vietnamese invasion and installation of an anti-Pol Pot
rebel communist government in 1979.
     Kong Vorn, who survived Pol Pot's liquidation of ''educated
people,'' came to Japan in 1981 as an immigrant.  He settled in
Yokohama and has been working at a Japanese company since then.
     In 1990 when he temporarily returned to Cambodia, he was shocked
to observe the desperate state of education in his home country.
     He organized the ''Cambodian Education Assistance Fund'' in 1993
and launched a fund-raising campaign for the reconstruction of
education, his supporters said.
     The fund so far has financed the building of two junior high
schools and an elementary school in Prey Veng Province, and has also
donated more than 100,000 U.S. dollars for school projects.

UNHCR pondering special fund for Rwandan refugees+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is considering
setting up a special fund for Rwandan refugees whose houses became
in need of repairs while they were away, its chief said Monday.
     Sadako Ogata, the high commissioner of the U.N. body, revealed
the planned 30 million dollar fund at a meeting with Foreign Minister
Yohei Kono, a Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
     The fund, to be launched within the UNHCR, will appeal to the
international community for contributions and help for repairing
dilapidated houses of Rwandan refugees.
     Ogata, a Japanese national, is back in Japan for a winter
vacation.
     She also expressed appreciation for Kono's pledge earlier this
month of some 20 million dollars in humanitarian aid for refugees in
the war-torn former Yugoslavia, the official said.
