<p align="left"><font size="1"><b>In light of next week's vote
regarding a California ballot initiative to allow physicians to
prescribe marijuana to seriously ill patients, NORML is forgoing
its usual weekly news release to spotlight the following *special*
report.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Making The Case For Medical
Marijuana</b></font><font size="4"><br>
</font><font size="3"><b><i>by NORML Publications Director Paul
Armentano</i></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Marijuana is medicine.&nbsp; It
has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of ailments.&nbsp;
Marijuana was legal in the United States and prominent in the
pharmacopoeia until 1937, when possession and use of marijuana
was outlawed by the federal government.&nbsp; Today, eight patients receive
marijuana legally from the government; for all other Americans
who could benefit from its therapeutic value, it remains a
forbidden medicine.&nbsp; The passage of Proposition 215 in California,
the Medical Marijuana Initiative, would be a first step in
amending this grievous and unnecessary crisis. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Contrary to popular belief, there have been
hundreds of studies on the medical uses of cannabis since its
introduction to western medicine in the mid-nineteenth
century.&nbsp; The best established medical use of smoked
marijuana is as an anti-nauseant for cancer chemotherapy.&nbsp;
During the 1980s, smoked marijuana was shown to be an effective
anti-emetic in six different state-sponsored clinical studies
involving nearly 1,000 patients.&nbsp; For the majority of these
patients, smoked marijuana proved more effective than both conventional
prescription anti-nauseants and oral THC (marketed today as the synthetic
pill, Marinol).&nbsp; For example, in a 1988 study by Dr. Vincent Vinciguerra
published in the <b><i>New York State Journal of Medicine</i></b>,
78 percent of patients who had shown no improvement with standard
anti-emetics responded favorably to marijuana.&nbsp; In addition,
29 percent of those patients who did not respond to oral THC did
respond to smoked marijuana.&nbsp; Vinciguerra concluded that the
results of the pilot study &quot;demonstrate that inhalation marijuana
is an effective therapy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting
due to cancer chemotherapy.&quot;[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#1"><font size="3"><b>1</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Similar findings were noted in state-sponsored
studies in New Mexico, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, and California.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#2"><font size="3"><b>2</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Currently, many oncologists are recommending marijuana
to their patients despite its prohibition.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#3"><font size="3"><b>3</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">In addition to its usefulness as an
anti-emetic, there exists evidence -- both scientific and anecdotal
-- that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering
for patients with a variety of other serious ailments, and that
it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for which
it may be substituted.&nbsp; For example, marijuana alleviates
the nausea, vomiting, and the loss of appetite caused by the AIDS
wasting syndrome and by treatment with AZT and other drugs without
accelerating the rate at which HIV positive individuals develop
clinical AIDS or other illnesses.&nbsp; Reportedly, 75 percent of the
12,000 members of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club were
Patients With AIDS (PWAs) and a recent survey of HIV-positive
patients in Australia found that one-quarter were using marijuana
therapeutically.[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#4"><font size="3"><b>4</b></font></a><font
size="3">,</font><a href="96-10-30.html#5"><font size="3"><b>5</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">It is generally accepted -- by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) and others -- that marijuana reduces
intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients suffering from glaucoma,
the leading cause of blindness in the United States.&nbsp; This
was first shown in a series of experiments by Robert S. Hepler of
UCLA, stemming from research aimed at finding out whether
marijuana dilated pupils.&nbsp; Hepler found a
&quot;statistically significant&quot; drop in IOP in 429 subjects
treated with marijuana or THC, 29 of which showed continued
benefits during 94 days of treatment with no signs of tolerance.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#6"><font size="3"><b>6</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Currently, three of the eight patients who
receive medicinal marijuana legally use it to treat glaucoma. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">There also exists historical evidence that
marijuana is effective in treating a variety of spastic conditions
such as multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, epilepsy, and
quadriplegia.&nbsp; In the book, <u>Marijuana: The Forbidden
Medicine</u>, Dr. Lester Grinspoon of Harvard Medical School
describes several case histories of patients suffering from
multiple sclerosis and other disorders whose condition improved
while they smoked marijuana and deteriorated after they stopped smoking.&nbsp;
In addition, a number of animal studies have supported
marijuana's ability to suppress convulsions.&nbsp; These studies
specifically indicate cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive ingredient
of marijuana unavailable in Marinol, to be a potent
anti-convulsant.&nbsp; This latter fact was recently reaffirmed
by the government's premiere marijuana expert, Dr. Mahmoud
ElSohly of the Marijuana Project at the University of
Mississippi, who stated during an interview with the <b><i>Journal
of the International Hemp Association</i></b> that, &quot;CBD
[cannabidiol] is famous for [its] anti-convulsant
activity.&quot;&nbsp; ElSohly concluded that, &quot;There is no
question about the use of cannabis for certain conditions.&nbsp;
It does have a history.&nbsp; It does have utility.&quot;[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#7"><font size="3"><b>7</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Marijuana is also used to treat those who seek
relief from chronic pain.&nbsp; Historically, marijuana was used
as an analgesic from ancient times through the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; This usage declined with the introduction of
faster acting and more potent, yet sometimes addicting, opiates
such as morphine.&nbsp; However, anecdotal reports demonstrate
that some patients currently receive their most effective pain
relief from using marijuana.&nbsp; Limited scientific studies on
nearly 100 patients have shown marijuana to be a potent
analgesic.[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#8"><font size="3"><b>8</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Evidence in support of marijuana's medical
value has existed for centuries and has been validated by
numerous studies, researchers, committees, health organizations,
and even the Drug Enforcement Agency's Chief Administrative Law
Judge, Francis L. Young, who in 1988 declared marijuana to be
&quot;one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
to man.&quot;[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#9"><font size="3"><b>9</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Unfortunately, patients who could benefit from
marijuana's therapeutic value have been held hostage by a federal
government that continues to treat the issue as a political football.&nbsp;
American medical patients deserve better and Proposition 215 is a genuine
and encouraging step to address their needs. </font></p>
