The Department continues its involvement in all clinical psychopharmacological research protocols involving drug, drug metabolites, and endogenous compounds of current interest in biological psychiatric research. The laboratory is currently the core laboratory for two NIMH center grants (Drs. Klein and Mann) and one NIDA center grant <BR>
(Dr. Kleber).

Analytical development work during the past year has involved assay of neurotransmitters and metabolites in urine, plasma, and spinal fluid in studies of aggression and stress in adolescents and adults. Neuroendocrine response studies to challenge medication e.g. fenfluramine, mCPP, methylphenidate, pindolol, etc. have been evaluated as probes into serotonergic and other neurotransmitter responsivity. Studies involve assays of drugs and metabolites, melatonin, growth hormone, cortisol, prolactin, dexamethasone, catecholamine, indolamines, platelet binding analysis of drugs have been completed. This aspect of the workload is the responsibility of Ms. Novacenko, Ms. Fein, Ms. Huttinot, and Mr. Green.

Dr. Raymond Suckow has received a second grant-in-aid from Ciba-Geigy Corp. to begin another phase of a pharmacokinetic study of reserpine comparing two formulations at a reduced dose. The application of a highly sensitive HPLC method previously developed in this laboratory and further modified to enhance the sensitivity (femtomole) permitted the monitoring of the elimination of reserpine in human subjects for several days following <BR>
a single dose.

Studies involving the isolation, identification, and quantitation of the major metabolite of bupropion were performed using a highly specialized semi-preparative chiral column. Both isomers were isolated and the optical rotation of each was determined. A purity <BR>
&gt;97% was achieved which will permit future in vitro and in vivo biological testing. This work was supported in part by a Psychiatric Institute Research Support Grant.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
New analytical procedures and modifications of existing methods were applied to the quantitation of risperidone and the 9-hydroxy metabolite, and paroxetine in anticipation of future clinical studies and grant applications. Other drug assays performed on a routine schedule included, but were not limited to, fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, as well as the  tricyclic antidepressants and their respective active metabolites.

Dr. Hungund continues his NIMH-supported research in attempting to understand the biochemical mechanisms of alcohol tolerance and dependence. We have extended these studies to examine the possibility of the existence of multiple forms of phospholipase PLA2 specific for selected phospholipids in the plasma membrane. Based on these ongoing studies, we believe this key enzyme may play an important role in adaptation mechanism to various amounts of alcohol consumption. Similarly acyltransferases responsible for the incorporation of acyl groups into lysopholipids generated by activation of PLA2s appear to be involved in repair mechanism. Our results so far indicate that both substrate specific PLA2s and acyltransferases exist in CNS membrane and that both enzymes are affected differentially in response to various doses of alcohol exposure in adult mice.

The results of studies on the mechanism of fetal alcohol affects (FAE) are very encouraging. We have shown an aberrant ganglioside profile in the fetal brain that was exposed to alcohol in utero on GD7 and 8. We have also shown that similar alcohol exposure led to accumulation of FAEEs, nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol, in various fetal organs. FAEEs are implicated in organ injury in chronic alcoholics. It is also interesting to note that treatment of pregnant rats prior to alcohol exposure prevented/reduced both aberrant ganglioside composition and FAEE accumulation. Thus GM1 may have a therapeutic value in prevention of fetal alcohol effects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a collaborative study with Dr. Patrick McGrath, a marker for chronic alcohol abuse has been developed. Preliminary studies suggest that polyunsaturated FAEEs accumulate in significant amounts in the blood of alcohol abusers. Similar accumulation of FAEEs but of saturated origin are reported to be found in the blood of acutely intoxicated human subjects. Thus, these markers may serve as an useful tool in diagnosing chronic vs. social drinkers and also in monitoring patients undergoing detoxification since no FAEEs are formed in the absence of alcohol in the system.

Dr. Barkai has continued his studies on the effects of haloperidol on calcium binding in localized areas of the rat brain. The results indicate that pretreatment of rats with this psychoactive drug enhanced calcium binding in several limbic structures, particularly in the hippocampus. These effects appear to be due to an increase in binding affinity involving cooperativity to calcium binding.

Dr. Barkai is currently engaged in a study of the effects of several antidepressants on the dynamics of local cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the rat following electrically-induced cerebral activation. These studies are designed to test the hypothesis that continuous treatment with antidepressants would cause differential alterations in rCBF responses to activating stimuli. Preliminary results indicate that the magnitude of rCBF responses to a single electroshock treatment and their return to 'baseline' values, varied in different brain regions. In some regions, the rate of decay of rCBF increments was significantly slower in rats treated with antidepressants. Such a slower decay in rCBF responses represents a compensatory increase in rCBF that is present for a longer period of time in treated animals. These preliminary results provided a basis for a grant application entitled "Local Cerebral Blood Flow and Antidepressants."

In addition, Dr. Barkai has continued the collaboration with Dr. Hungund in studies on the acylation and deacylation of neuronal membrane phospholipids. These studies are aimed at understanding mechanisms of ethanol effects on the nervous system.

Dr. Lo has focussed upon the development of highly sensitive HPLC techniques for the assay of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in human plasma, spinal fluid, and urine. These procedures are currently being applied to an NIMH-funded study of stress in heart transplant patients (Drs. Shapiro, Sloane, Liaison Psychiatry). Dr. Lo has also published studies on the pharmacokinetics of betamethasone using transdermal patches. This work was made possible because Dr. Lo had developed a highly sensitive polyclonal antibody to dexamethasone which cross-reacted with betamethasone. After optimizing the assay for betamethasone we were able to obtain full kinetic profiles of this compound formulation for the first time.

Dr. Lo, in collaboration with Dr. K.S. Hui (NKI), has pursued his long standing interest in enkephalins. A NIDA-funded study has resulted in the purification of brain Arg0-Met5- enkephalin to homogeneity with further identification by RIA, ELISA, HPLC, micro- sequencing, inhibition of amino-enkephalinase and suppression of contraction of vas deferens. Results indicate that this peptide is an immediate precursor and endogenous inhibitor of met-enkephalins.

Mr. Trivedi has developed an assay for the stereoisomers of methylphenidate in plasma. The assay has picogram/ml sensitivity and is suitable for application in studies in children (collaboration with Dr. Greenhill).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The unit continues to collaborate with investigators within the medical school and at many academic research centers in the USA, Canada, and Israel. The development of mass spectrometric procedures for cocaine and its five major metabolites in plasma, tissue, and other body fluids has made possible a NIDA-funded collaboration with Dr. Morishima (Department of Anesthesiology) investigating the hemodynamics and behavioral response to cocaine and cocaethyl in the pregnant sheep and rat. This study includes investigation of the pharmacokinetics of maternal-fetal and fetal-maternal transport of these toxic compounds.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Collaborative work on clozapine blood levels and therapeutic response has been most productive. Two separate studies (Dr. Potkin of the University of California at Irvine and Dr. Lieberman of Hillside  Hospital, Long Island Jewish Hospital) have demonstrated threshold blood levels above which clinical response is optimal. This has major importance in the management of clozapine treatment in this difficult treatment-refractory population.
