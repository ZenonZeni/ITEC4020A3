ALREADY-AGREED MEASURES </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>A great deal of environmental legislation is already agreed at either
the European or National level, but is not yet fully implemented. Legislative
measures that affect emissions of ozoneforming chemicals were examined
and included in the EMEP modelling to predict future air quality. The 'do
nothing more' picture for 2010 is certainly encouraging. Figure 1b gives
the Auto/Oil Programme's predictions for the year 2010 given already-agreed
measures. The exceedances of the 99 percentile 180 &#181;g/m3 hourly value
are much reduced but still centred in northern Europe. These already-agreed
measures would bring the EU into 99 percentile compliance with, for example,
the alert threshold 1-hour standard of 240 &#181;g/m3 used in Germany.
</P>

<P>More would need to be done to reach the ambitious goal of 180 &#181;g/m3
in 2010. The EMEP modelling work showed that a 70 per cent reduction in
emissions of ozone-forming chemicals (NOx and VOCs) was needed from both
mobile and stationary sources (Figure 3a and 3b). </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>PROPOSED NEW MEASURES</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>A wide range of different emission reduction measures were carefully
examined which covered the following: </P>

<UL>
<LI>improved vehicle technology; </LI>

<LI>improved fuel quality; </LI>

<LI>better vehicle maintenance and annual inspection tests; and </LI>

<LI>local initiatives such as road pricing and public transport.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The individual cost-effectiveness of each measure was then calculated
and ranked (Figure 4). Then the most cost-effective emission reduction
measures were selected, first to attain the NOx air quality target, secondly
the particulate matter target, and thirdly the ozone target. It was the
ozone target which proved the most difficult to achieve and brought about
the selection of the most stringent emission control measures. </P>

<P>Figure 1c shows the effects of the Auto/Oil Programme measures on ozone
concentrations, provided the precursor emission reductions achieved in
the transport sector from 1990 are matched by those from the stationary
sector. Figures 1d, 3a and 3b all reinforce the need for equivalent measures
from stationary sources. There would be widespread exceedances of the ozone
air quality target in 2010 without these equivalent measures. </P>

<P>For 2005, the European Commission has proposed a second set of even
more stringent standards for vehicles, and a study to determine the need
for further tightening of fuel measures in 2005. This 'second step', with
the most severe measures on fuels, has a minimum impact on air quality
in 2010. This is demonstrated in Figures 3a and 3b, but the impact on overall
costs is very high. A far more certain and necessary path to attaining
air quality targets in Europe is to tackle the emissions from stationary
sources in a cost-effective way. CONCAWE has already expressed its willingness
to help explore the cost-effectiveness of measures to reduce oil industry
stationary source emissions to meet air quality targets and is encouraging
other industry sectors to follow suit. </P>
