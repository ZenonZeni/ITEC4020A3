querying and information retrieval approaches that will
allow varied databases to be accessed with a single query
and retrieval of different types of data into a common
information space; research on visualization and
manipulation of data about the brain and behavior; research
on integration and synthesis of data that increasingly is
highly specialized and narrowly focused; development of
tools for electronic collaboration that would enable teams
at different sites to assemble quickly and address specific
scientific questions; and research that builds bridges
across existing information tools and resources.

Areas of interest in brain and/or behavioral research
include development of tools for dealing with data from
different biological levels of organization, such as
molecules, genes, cells and systems of cells, and from
behavioral constructs such as attention and perception; and
research that taps structure-function relationships at all
levels of organization.  Research should be generalizable;
sophisticated and performed on sophisticated platforms;
extensible and salable; and designed to assess progress.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE: THE FEDERAL REGISTER

The Federal Register -- the federal government's 60-year-old
regulatory affairs reporter -- remains a key grantseeking
tool, even in the electronic age.

The Register last month announced free access to its own
searchable electronic version.

And despite increased use of the Internet by agencies to
advertise funding opportunities directly, the Register is
the forum of choice for certain health-related funders.

In addition to running grant notices, the Register also
updates readers daily on critical rules, regulations and
actions that shape grant competitions.

By following official developments, grantseekers can stay on
top of changes that could affect their eligibility under a
grant program or effect new procedures and requirements.

In its electronic form, readers can have a custom-tailored
Register.  Instead of slogging
through pages of extraneous text dealing with agencies in
which readers may have no interest, readers can key into
only the information they need.

"It's what they've always asked for," says Richard
Claypoole, director of the Federal Register.


And the electronic version has caught on, he says.  Even
before the Register went public,  subscribers logged 558,369
document retrievals from November to December.

In whatever form, grantseekers can use the Federal Register
to:

*  Mine grant nuggets:  The Health Resources and Services
Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Energy
Department regularly use the Federal Register to announce
grant competitions.

Browsers will find health-related Education Department
notices and health and life science notices from the
Agriculture Department and the Environmental Protection
Agency.*  Check on winners:  A few agencies, such as the
Housing and Urban Development Department, use the Federal
Register to announce recent awards.  Announcements are
occasional, but they can provide insights about program
constituents and reveal subgrant and subcontracting
possibilities.

*  Respond to proposed program rules and funding priorities:
Laws creating grant programs often require agencies to
publish regulations before getting down to grantmaking.
Grantseekers can influence program direction by commenting
on the proposals appearing in the Federal Register.*  Keep
up with grant-related policies:  The Register provides the
full text on government-wide policies affecting grants and
contracts, such as Office of Management and Budget circulars
related to university research costs.*In fact, revisions to
OMB Circular A-21, which deals with university costs, could
hit the Register late this month. *  Learn about meetings:
Agencies publish announcements for meetings, ranging from
preapplication workshops and advisory group sessions to
policy-setting forums, including meetings on grantseekers'
home turf.  Notices specify when and where meetings will be
held and which parts will be open to the public.

But the Federal Register also has its drawbacks -- for hard
copy and electronic users.  Agencies used to soliciting
grant applications via the Register sometimes bypass the
publication these days, finding it faster and easier to go
with electronic announcements.

For example, EPA's 1996 grant competition, announced on the
Internet last month, has yet to make it into the Register.
Unless their announcements have regulatory impact, says
Claypoole, agencies are not required to publish application
notices in the Register.

And whether users are hard copy or on-screen readers, they
routinely must trudge through pages of often confusing
legalese.  To make things easier, the Federal Register
office regularly holds workshops on how to use the Federal
Register system.  The 1996 schedule includes workshops in
and out of Washington.

Other efforts to make life easier include a new column on
regulations taking effect that day and a daily reminder of
impending closing dates for comments on proposed rules.
