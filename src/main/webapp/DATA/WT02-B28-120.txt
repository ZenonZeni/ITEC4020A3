<STRONG>Looking Toward Tomorrow</STRONG><BR>
According to a recent survey<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, more people between the
ages of 18
to 34 believe in
UFOs  more than they believe that there will be money left in Social Security when they
retire. 
One could dismiss this
merely as the voice of a cynical generation but many financial experts have also
expressed reservations
regarding the future of the U.S. Social Security system.  With working baby-boomers
comprising a large
portion of the U.S. population, the current Social Security system, funded by the
nation's workforce, is
fine.  But what happens when today's boomers retire, and become tomorrow's
recipients of Social
Security benefits?  What if there are more people receiving benefits, in the next
century, than there are in
the workforce funding those benefits?  
<P>
Many individuals in their twenties and thirties aren't wasting time speculating -
they're planning for the
future.  According to the June 15, 1995 Wall Street Journal, 61% of
"twenty-somethings" responding to a
survey sponsored by Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (a Chicago based money
management firm)
stated that they or their spouse had put money aside for retirement.  The article
also revealed that many
respondents "were prepared to cut personal spending now in order to save for
retirement."  Even more
so than the boomers before them, today's under-35s are planning for the long-term
future.  With a
responsible mind focused on the future, it's also important to keep an eye on
today, as well.
<P>
Perhaps this is why one of the preferred long-term financial vehicles named by the
respondents of the
Kemper poll was life insurance.  It's wise to want to preserve future assets as
long as it does not turn
into a situation of "putting the cart before the horse."  While the baby boomer
generation may have been
inclined to ignore insurance in favor of financial products with potentially
quicker and higher returns,
more and more consumers under thirty-five have recognized the long-term advantages
of products
such as whole life insurance. The first asset that younger consumers should seek to
protect -
perhaps the most important asset - is themselves, and what they have today.  Whole
life is a smart
step in that direction.
<P>
<STRONG>Starting With Today</STRONG><BR>
The beauty of whole life insurance is that it not only offers the long-term
benefits of cash value and
tax-deferred accumulation, but it also offers immediate coverage in the event of a
tragedy.  For a married
individual, the need for life insurance is obvious; so much rides on an income the
family is counting on:
the mortgage payments, living expenses, child care costs - even the future plans
for a child's
education.
<P>
For young single individuals, the life insurance need is sometimes less obvious,
but just as real.  A
crucial step toward true independence lies in making sure that no one else will be
forced to shoulder
the consequences of choices that we've made.  Many people in their twenties have to
borrow money
from their families, or from financial institutions.  Frequently, young singles
with student loans, car
loans, or mortgages on a condo are only able to secure these funds by having a
loved one co-sign the
loan, as well.  If something were to happen to the young single person, the person
who co-signed the
loan would be fully responsible for the debt repayment.  What if there were not
enough liquid resources
to pay off the debts and loans?  Losing a loved one is difficult enough; combined
with having to deal
with exorbitant financial debts and struggles, it quickly becomes a devastating
experience. 
<P>
Whole life insurance protects against the financial consequences of these potential
tragedies, and it
also gives the younger consumer a financial foundation to build on for the rest of
his/her life.  With cash
value, tax deferred growth, and the accumulation potential of dividends<A
HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>, whole life
insurance can easily evolve from today's protection plan to the beginning of
tomorrow's retirement plan. 
What's more: the younger the insured, the more affordable insurance is.  Since
everyone needs this
coverage sooner or later, it's
a good idea to get it when it's more affordable - and when good health will usually
assure coverage. 
Unfortunately, once health has declined, insurance is often no longer an option. 
Ironically, this could be
when people need it the most.
<P>
Whether anticipating the future or focusing on today, the under-35 consumer should
always keep this in
mind: the ideal plan allows for today's protection as well as tomorrow's
possibilities. The financial
choices made today impact the rest of one's life.
