<title>The Northern Miner - Indonesian partners file suit -- Placer fires shot in battle for Busang</title>
<h2>The Northern Miner Vol. 82 No. 47 January 20, 1997</h2>
<h3>Indonesian partners file suit -- Placer fires shot in battle for Busang</h3>
<p>
<strong>by James Whyte</strong><p>
Claiming that his company is "the best company to develop Busang," PlacerDome (PDG-T) President John Willson fired the opening round in what he hopeswill become a bidding war between his company and Barrick Gold (ABX-T) forthe Busang gold deposit in Indonesia.
<p>
Deprived of a chance to make a deal with Bre-X Minerals (BXM-T) to develop
the gold deposit in East Kalimantan, Placer Dome is offering Bre-X a merger
on essentially equal terms.
<p>
Placer made its bid in a Jan. 13 letter to Walsh, inviting Bre-X to open
negotiations for a merger. The letter, signed by Willson, said in part that
Placer Dome wants "to enter into a tax-effective, stock-for-stock `merger of
equals' at a significant premium to the current market price." The proposed
share swap does not include a cash component.
<p>
At the close of trading on Jan. 15, Placer Dome shares were valued at $28.10
and Bre-X shares at $24.45. A merger offer would likely entail a share
exchange ratio of about one-to-one. Willson suggested the merger offer would
be more attractive to Bre-X shareholders than the company's Dec. 16
development deal with Barrick. "It will give them the opportunity to decide
what happens to their company," he said.
<p>
To qualify for pooling treatment under Canadian accounting rules, the
combined company would have to be owned roughly equally by Placer Dome and
Bre-X. "In effect, the final ownership of the company has to be within the
45-55% range," said Willson. That, in turn, would make Bre-X President David
Walsh the largest single shareholder in Placer Dome.
<p>
The merger proposal comes as the Indonesian Ministry of Mines and Energy
considers the development deal between Bre-X and Barrick, mandated by the
Ministry in late November. The government's action -- in effect, handing the
project to Barrick without a bidding process -- brought criticism from the
international mining industry and from a number of quarters in the country,
including environmental organizations and influential businessmen. Barrick's
joint-venture agreement with an industrial conglomerate headed by Indonesian
President Suharto's eldest daughter also brought criticism.
<p>
Willson intimated that Placer Dome had received some signs from the
government that other bidders might be considered after all. "We have sensed
a desire by the Indonesians to do this thing in the right way, and most
recently have received some encouragement." Willson also asserted that Placer
Dome would not be looking for favors in Indonesia: "We don't expect that we
will be making agreements with any people within the Suharto family, or
within top government circles, for services."
<p>
The proposal also dangles a 40% net interest for the government and for
Indonesian-based minority shareholders in the Busang land package that covers
the Bre-X deposit. One of those companies, Kreung Gasui, has a 10% interest
in the Busang Central property and contends that it is entitled to between
10% and 30% of the rest of the project.
<p>
On the day following the release of the Placer proposal, lawyers acting for
Kreung Gasui and its controlling shareholder, Indonesian businessman Jusuf
Murukh, filed suit in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench seeking an order
that Bre-X recognize the company's interest in the larger Busang Southeast
property.
<p>
The suit names Bre-X and 19 other parties as respondents, including Bre-X
executives David Walsh and John Felderhof, Indonesian partner Askatindo Karya
Mineral and two of its principals, and Minorca Resources (MAR-M), which has
an agreement to earn 70% of Askatindo's interest.
<p>
Central to the claim is Kreung's 10% equity interest in Westralian Atan
Minerals, the joint-venture company that Bre-X absorbed when it took up the
Busang project in 1993. Kreung maintains that it has an option to acquire an
additional 20% of the joint venture. "The participation in Westralian is key
to the claim to the interest [in Busang Southeast]," said lawyer Aleck
Trawick of Blake Cassels & Graydon, the firm retained by Kreung.
<p>
Bre-X's immediate reply to the suit was a press release in which company
President David Walsh described the action as "frivolous, completely without
merit," and stated the company would contest the action. At presstime,
Minorca's president, Roland Horst, said the company had not received any
notice that it, or Askatindo, had been named in the suit.
<p>
Placer Dome's proposal tries to protect the company against the property
dispute, stating the merger can only go ahead if Bre-X can show "receipt of a
suitable Contract of Work, satisfactory resolution of ownership issues, and
regulatory and shareholder approvals." Placer stated its willingness to enter
negotiations with the Indonesian government and with Bre-X's partners to
resolve the ownership claims and to ensure the project will get a Contract of
Work. Because Placer is basing its merger proposal only on public
information, the proposal stipulates that Placer can do its own due diligence
investigation before the deal closes.
<p>
Kreung Gasui and Murukh, who had been virtually silent while it appeared that
Barrick had secured Busang, are believed to have picked Alberta as a venue
because Bre-X is based in Calgary and an order could be enforced there
against the company. The plaintiffs could file actions in Indonesian courts
that might have jurisdiction over the property. But if reports that the
government's sentiment is shifting away from the Barrick deal are accurate,
court action in Indonesia could be unproductive.
<p>
Barrick Gold had no comment on the lawsuit but considers the bidding process
to be closed and sees no future for other bids. Vice-president Vincent Borg
said "the Placer proposal misses the mark," adding that "the government
decided [on Barrick] based on our superior track record."
<p>
If the bidding process were to be opened, Newmont Gold (NGC-N), Teck (TEK-T)
and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold (FCX-N) could also be potential suitors
for Bre-X. Recent drill results from the property, from two section lines in
the extreme southeastern part of the deposit, returned gold grades mainly in
the 2-to-7-gram-per-tonne range, but also some "bonanza" intersections,
including a 396-metre interval grading 12.6 grams.
<p>
Other drill intersections included 373 metres grading an average of 7.4
grams, 347 metres grading 3 grams, and 324 metres grading 5.9 grams. Bre-X
has not revised the resource figure for the deposit, which stands at 780
million tonnes grading 2.3 grams gold (equivalent to 57 million contained
ounces of gold).
<p>
Placer's letter to Walsh also sketched out a development plan for Busang,
proposing a 4-year construction schedule that would proceed in stages. With
an initial daily capacity of 50,000 tonnes, the project would be expanded
50,000 tonnes at a time to a total of 200,000 tonnes per day, provided
engineering studies supported the expansion. The first stage would incur a
US$600-million capital cost, and bringing the mine to a 200,000-tonne
capacity is expected to run about US$1.7 billion.
<p>
Placer believes the construction schedule would allow production as early as
1999, since engineering staff can be moved on to the project immediately.
<p>
Placer also plans to use recent design work from its Las Cristinas project in
Venezuela. "There is no question we can handle a 200,000-tonne-per-day
project," Placer's letter states. "This is a simple mill, a simple process;
it's a question of size. There's no new technology, and there's no doubt it's
do-able. The work that we have been doing to design Cristinas is going to
give us an immediate advantage in putting together the 50,000-tonne-per-day
modules."
<p>
If the bid to develop Busang succeeds, the big Indonesian project will assume
top priority. "Clearly, with a first-class project like this we will be able
to focus on our very best quality assets," said Willson. Placer's Cristinas
project, the Pipeline deposit in Nevada, and the Musselwhite mine in Ontario
(a joint venture with TVX Gold [TVX-T]), are all nearing production, so
development at Busang should not interfere with their progress. But projects
at earlier stages, such as Cerro Crucitas in Costa Rica and Donlin Creek in
Alaska, may find themselves shuffled aside, at least in the early stages of
development at Busang.
<p>
In the meantime, the parties will be waiting for the government's reaction to
the Barrick deal and to Placer's proposal. Willson said the company had
already placed its proposal to Bre-X before the government: "It's with the
president and the top ministers . . . It could take weeks, and perhaps
months."
