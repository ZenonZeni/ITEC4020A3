<H1>CORRECTED SALT: Pleasant Tasting Balanced Condiment Containing Magnesium </H1>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<H3>10 Shakes from an average salt shaaker equals approximately 1 gram of CORRECTED SALT and contains:</H3>
<TABLE BORDER=10>
<tr>
<td>Sodium 14.7 milliequivalents</td>
<td>Chloride 14.8 milliequivalents</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sulfur 0.16 milliequivalents</td>
<td>Magnesium 1.10 milliequivalents</td>
</tr>
<td colspan=2>Pure Sodium Chloride and Elemental Magnesium as PolyMagPlex<sup>TM</sup> which is a proprietary blend of high quality magnesium sources including magnesium citrate, aspartate gluconate and glyerophosphate plus Sulfur and Sea Salt for trace amounts of other minerals.</td>

</TABLE>


 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PLAQUE </H2>
<P>Hardening of the arteries is caused by a build-up of "plaque," a deposit made up of fats, cholesterols, proteins, minerals, especially calcium, toxins and heavy metals. Plaque reduces the size of the arteries, making it more difficult for the blood to flow through them properly. It reduces their elasticity. High blood pressure can result, and therefore the heart must work harder to pump our blood. Eventually, the heart wears out and serious health problems arise. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the Western World.</P>
<P>  Laboratory tests have shown that both table salt and regular salt substitutes contribute heavily to the build-up of plaque in the arteries.  Regular table salt contains sodium chloride and as many as forty other ingredients such as acids, sugar, silicates for flowing characteristics and others. Commercial salt substitutes usually contain potassium chloride plus the same additional ingredients contained in table salt. Both sodium chloride (when its effect is not offset with magnesium) and potassium chloride are strongly anabolic substances and their continued use can contribute heavily to the build-up of plaque in the blood vessels.  When people develop arterial plaque or when high blood pressure develops, the first thing their doctors tell them is to cut down their salt intake.</P>
<P> CORRECTED SALT is one of the most revolutionary  nutritional products ever developed.  Some of the negative effects of both sodium and chloride are balanced by a unique formula of magnesium and sulfur.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW CORRECTED SALT WORKS</H2>

<P> There are two  general  classifications  of normal chemical reactions in the body: (1)Anabolic, which are constructive and "build-up"; and (2) Catabolic, which break substances down. Research has proven that our metabolism shifts, or cycles back and forth, from anabolic to catabolic, depending on which type of reactions may be dominant in the body at that time.  To maintain optimum health, our metabolism should cycle back and forth daily. If it doesn't, certain conditions are more likely to develop if we are "stuck" in an anabolic mode, yet others are more likely to develop if we are catabolic most of the time.
 According to theory, the depositing of plaque in the arteries is an anabolic process, because it is characterized by a "build-up". It so happens that both sodium and chloride (the ingredients in table salt) are strongly anabolic and stimulate anabolic processes in the body. The same is true of potassium. Therefore, potassium chloride (the most common salt substitute) can be just as damaging.</P>
<P>  CORRECTED SALT contains a predetermined balance of both anabolic and catabolic minerals.  The anabolic  nutrients,  sodium  and  chloride  in CORRECTED SALT are balanced by the catabolic minerals, magnesium and sulfur. CORRECTED SALT also contains trace elements from natural sea salt.  It tastes like salt, because it contains salt; but instead of being heavily anabolic, it is balanced because of its formulation. You get the same great flavor of regular table salt but you don't have to be concerned about the bad effects of regular salt.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P> CORRECTED SALT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.  Other salt products contain numerous other ingredients, but CORRECTED SALT is 100% pure with only the PhytoZyme base added.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE CORRECTED SALT</H2>
<P>  CORRECTED SALT is intended to be used as you would normally use table salt. Simply throw out all your regular salt and fill your salt shakers with CORRECTED SALT. Use it in cooking or baking. It does not contain any preservatives, acids, starches or flowing agents. It has a tendency to "cake up" in high humidity after it has been opened. Therefore, it is recommended that you place it in a dry place. If it does cake up, simply place it in the oven (not the microwave) for a while to drive off the moisture. Then, simply break the clusters apart so it will flow through your salt shaker.</P>


<P>Suggested Use: Use freely as a condiment a the table or in cooking and baking as you would regular table salt.</P>
