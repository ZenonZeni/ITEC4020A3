<blockquote>
<P>


<tt>By TODD G. DAVIS &amp; CORAZON IBARRA-ILARINA, M.D.</tt><p>

	Vision is something that everyone takes for granted until you wake up one morning and find yourself suddenly going blind. <p>
	When I looked in the mirror and saw a small spot in front of my eyes, I quickly convinced myself it was nothing to worry about. I went to work as usual but by the afternoon the spot had grown larger and I went to an eye doctor. My left eye tested normal, but my right eye showed a vision loss of 25%.  A follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist revealed that the retina was not detached or torn. By the next day, my visual loss was about 30% and continuing to degenerate and I was beginning to panic. <p>
	A month went by and my visual loss was now 60%. I had seen several M.D.s, two neural ophthalmologists, a rheumatology specialist, and a retina surgeon, yet all I had was a mountain of medical bills and a battery of negative test results. Except for the antinuclear antibody blood test that checks the condition of the immune system: this came back abnormal. Meanwhile, I was on large doses of solumedrol, a steroid that the doctors hoped would activate my immune system. <p>
	There was no improvement, however, and at 6 weeks my right eye was 96% blind and its vision split and blurred.<p>
 	The doctors still had no answers when the vision in my left eye began to deteriorate much more quickly than the right. Two weeks later, I had lost almost 75% of the vision in that eye.  With both eyes almost blind, I was no longer able to care for myself. I could not drive, cook, clean the house, or do everyday things. My medical bills were in excess of $50,000 and I had given up hope of ever knowing what was wrong. <p>
	Then I heard about a homeopathic medical doctor in Reno, Nevada, who might be able to help me. Corazon Ibarra-Ilarina, M.D, was the only person I talked to who said she had seen something like this before and had actually achieved some success in treating it. <p>
	My other doctors did not see how a homeopathic doctor could help me when conventional medicine had not made any progress. They were at the point of believing that my blindness was purely psychosomatic. I went to Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina’s clinic expecting some type of “voodoo” to fix what was in my mind.<p>
	Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina tested my “circulation efficiency” and toxicity. She did this by measuring the electrical tension of the skin on my fingers and toes, a process called electro-dermal screening. I thought this was crazy at first, but then Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina told me something that proved to me this was not a hoax.  <p>
	She said that my body was registering radioactivity and wanted to know if I had been around anything that would cause this. “No,” I replied, but then I remembered the test the doctors had given me in the hospital which required me to take a pill that was radioactive.  So there was something to this screening test after all. <p>
	My toxicity levels topped the scales. I had a severe “circulation efficiency” problem on account of the toxins in my body. This was strange to us both because I had no history of toxic exposure and had never been sick except for a pseudo-stroke I had when I was 18. But I fully recovered from that in 6 weeks. <p>
	Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina said that if she could correct these problems, I might have a chance of regaining some of my vision. So I began a daily supplementation program of vitamins, herbs, homeopathic remedies, hydrogen peroxide, and chelation therapy. <p>
	In 10 days the vision in my left eye began to return and the blurriness disappeared. My vision continued to improve. In all, I spent a month at the clinic receiving treatments daily, after which time the vision in my left eye was at almost 100% and the vision in my right eye was 60%. Now, four months later, my vision has stayed the same.  I am back at work and leading a normal life.  I have adjusted to having only 60% vision in one eye because it is 60% more than I had six months ago. The remaining 40% may not return on account of possible nerve damage to the eye, Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina speculates.<p>
	But because of Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina’s treatments, I can live my life again as normally as any fully sighted person.<p>
