<H2>Factory construction</H2>
<P>
Equally as important as the cost of land, is the cost of constructing
a factory, and the time taken for construction. Melbourne is very
competitive on both counts.
<P>
<I><B>Melbourne's factory construction costs are 41% lower and
construction time is 80% shorter than in Singapore. Compared
to Bangkok, it costs 28% less and takes 33% less time to
build
a factory in Melbourne.</B></I>
