<CENTER><H1>Chernobyl and Soviet Reactors</H1>Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 22<P>December 1995</CENTER><P><HR><B>
<UL><LI>The Chernobyl accident was the result of a flawed reactor design that
was operated outside authorised procedures.
<LI>The resulting steam explosion and fire released 3-4 per cent of
the reactor core into the atmosphere.
<LI>31 people were killed, and there have since been ten deaths from
thyroid cancer due to the accident.
<li>Other similar reactors continue to operate, at the Chernobyl site and also
in Russia and Lithuania.</UL></B>
<HR><P>The April 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Ukraine was the product of a very flawed Soviet reactor design
coupled with serious mistakes made by the plant operators who during a test,
violated procedures intended to ensure safe operation of the plant. <P>

The accident destroyed the reactor, killed 31 people almost immediately (28
from radiation exposure), caused radiation sickness in a further 200-300, and 
contaminated large areas of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and beyond.<P>

About 130,000 people received significant radiation doses (ie above
internationally accepted ICRP limits) and are being closely monitored.  
A much larger number received some radiation exposure from the accident. 
About ten deaths from thyroid cancer have occurred, and further deaths from
leukaemia and other cancers are expected. <P>The Chernobyl accident was a
unique event and the only time in the history of commercial nuclear power that
radiation-related fatalities occurred. <P>
The Soviet-designed RBMK-type reactor of 950 MWe unit uses a large mass of
graphite to moderate the reaction and water flowing through channels
holding the fuel elements to cool it.  There is no containment structure on
this kind of reactor. 
<P><B>WHAT HAPPENED</B><P>On 25 April the reactor crew at Chernobyl 4 began
preparing for a test to determine how long turbines would spin and supply
power following a complete shut down of the reactor.  Similar tests had
already been carried out successfully at Chernobyl and other plants.<P>

A series of operator mistakes including the disabling of automatic shutdown
mechanisms preceded the attempted test early on 26 April. 
As water flow diminished, power output increased.  
When the operator moved to shut down the reactor from its unstable condition
arising from his previous errors, a peculiarity of the design caused the power
to surge dramatically.<P> 

The fuel elements ruptured and the resultant steam lifted off the 
cover plate of the reactor, releasing fission products to the atmosphere.  
A second explosion threw out fragments of burning fuel and graphite from the
core and allowed air to rush in, causing the graphite to burst into flames.  
The graphite burned for 9 days, causing the main  release of radioactivity
into the environment. <P>

Some 5000 tonnes of boron, dolomite, sand, clay and lead were dropped on to
the burning core by helicopter in an effort to extinguish the blaze 
and limit the release of radioactive particles.<P>

<B>IMMEDIATE IMPACT</B>
<P>It is estimated that about 3 to 4% of the total radioactive material
in the Chernobyl 4 reactor core was released from the plant. Most of this 
was deposited as dust close by, the rest was carried by wind over the 
Ukraine and Europe.<P>

The main casualties were among the firefighters who
attended the initial small fires on the roof of the turbine building, 
which were all put out in a few hours.<P>

The next task was cleaning up the radioactivity at the site so 
that the remaining three reactors could be restarted, and the 
damaged reactor shielded more permanently.  According to Soviet 
estimates 600,000 people involved in the recovery and clean up immediately 
after the accident received high doses of radiation.

<P>Some children in the surrounding areas were exposed to radiation 
doses sufficient to lead to thyroid cancers, (which themselves 
are not usually fatal if diagnosed and treated early).  Early
radiation exposure was due to iodine-131; later, caesium-137 was the main
hazard.<P>

Initially some 45 000 residents were evacuated from a 10 km radius of the
plant.  In May 1986, all those living within an 30 kilometre radius of the
plant - a further 100 000 people, had been relocated.<P>

<B>ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS</B>

<P>Several organisations have reported on the impacts of the Chernobyl
accident, but all have found difficulties in assessing the significance 
of what they have observed because of the paucity of reliable 
statistical information on health matters prior to 1986. <P>

In 1989 the World Health Organisation (WHO) raised concerns that local
medical scientists were not well versed in radiation effects and had
incorrectly attributed various biological and health effects to 
radiation exposure.  A Red Cross team in 1990 raised similar concerns
regarding thyroid problems encountered in the population.<P>

An IAEA study involving more than 100 experts in 1991 was more 
substantial, and in the absence of pre 1986 data used a control 
population to compare those exposed to radiation.  They found 
significant health disorders in both control and exposed groups, 
but at that stage none was radiation related. 

<P>Studies in the Ukraine, Russia and Belarus since have confirmed 
a rising
incidence of thyroid cancer among exposed children.  Late in 
1995, WHO linked nearly 700 cases of thyroid cancer among children and
adolescents to the Chernobyl accident, and among these some ten deaths are
attributed to radiation from it. <P>Psycho-social effects among those
affected by the accident are emerging as a major concern, and are similar to
those arising from other major disasters such as earthquakes, fires amd
floods. <P>

<B>CHERNOBYL TODAY</B><P>The Chernobyl unit 4 is now enclosed in a 
concrete sarcophagus which allows continuing operation of the other 
reactors at the plant. However, the structure has been weakened by
radioactivity.  A feasibility study is examining remedial work including
possible replacement of the whole structure.<P>

Numerous safety deficiencies remain in the other reactors at Chernobyl.
However, worsening energy shortages necessitate the continued operation 
of those reactors. <P>The Ukraine is dependent upon, and deeply in 
debt to, Russia for energy supplies, particularly oil and gas, and 
these have been drastically reduced.  Continued operation of its 
nuclear power stations, which supply about 30% of its electricity, 
has become even more important and the country is pursuing the 
development of nuclear fuel cycle facilities which will increase its 
energy independence.<P>

<B>SOVIET-DESIGNED REACTORS</B><P>
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the safety 
of nuclear power plants in the former Eastern bloc is a problem of 
continuing concern.  The current energy demand in these countries is 
such that there is little flexibility to allow for closing even those 
plants which are of most concern. <P>There are currently 63 nuclear 
plants in operation in the former Eastern bloc countries and others 
under construction.  They include:

<UL>
<LI>11 first generation VVER-440/230 pressurised water reactors which 
have serious design deficiencies (4 in Bulgaria, 4 in Russia, 2 in 
Slovakia, 1 in Armenia).  Four such units in 
eastern Germany have been permanently shut down. 
<LI>14 second generation VVER-440/213 pressurised water reactors with 
some major design deficiencies which have been partly remedied.  
(Two more in Finland have been greatly modified.) 
<LI>20 third generation VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors with a 
full containment structure.  These have some instrumentation and control
system deficiencies.
<LI>15 RBMK light water graphite reactors such as at Chernobyl, in 
operation in (and unique to) Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania.  The five 
oldest of these were commissioned in the 1970s at Kursk (2), 
Leningrad (2) and Chernobyl (1), and are of most concern. 
<LI>4 small GBWR reactors in eastern Siberia, constructed in the 1970s.
</UL>

Significant assistance has been initiated by the OECD, IAEA and 
Commission of the European Communities to bring these reactors up to 
western safety standards, or at least to effect significant 
improvements.  This involves plant modifications, identification and 
remedying of safety deficiencies, training of staff and audits of the 
status of plant components. <P>

The national, bilateral and international safety initiatives being 
undertaken are concentrating on the first generation of Soviet-built
VVER-440/230 pressurised water reactors and the RBMK reactors, which 
have  the most serious deficiencies.

<P>Modifications have already been made to overcome deficiencies in the 
15 RBMK reactors still operating.  In these, originally the nuclear 
chain reaction and power output would increase if cooling water were 
lost, in contrast to Western designs.  It was this effect which caused 
the uncontrolled power surge that led to the destruction of Chernobyl 
unit 4.  Automated inspection equipment has also been installed in 
these reactors. <P>

The other  class of reactors which has been the focus of 
international attention for safety upgrades is the VVER-440/230 
reactors.  One of these, in Armenia, was restarted late in 1995 after 
a six-year shutdown.  However it had been substantially upgraded 
and an IAE A inspection had then approved it. <P>

<CENTER><H3>Chernobyl Accident Health Effects - WHO Facts & Figures</H3></CENTER>
<P>The following is the text of a briefing paper issued in May 1995 
to officials of the World Health Organisation on the known health 
effects of the 1986 Chernobyl accident.<P>

<CENTER><H4>THE CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT</H4>26 April 1986</CENTER><P>

In connection with the anniversary of the Chernobyl accident I have 
received a number of requests for information about the health effects 
that have followed the accident.  The following is an extract from a recent
report giving details of the health effects that have been verified so 
far and those that might be expected in the future, which may prove 
useful to members of WHO's European Centre for Environment and Health.<P>

"In the accident about 200 persons among the operating staff and the 
fire fighting crew suffered acute effects of radiation.  About 115,000
residents were moved from the 30 km radius exclusion zone surrounding 
the reactor, and there is the possibility that an additional 200,000 
or more will be relocated in the future.  Some 650,000 persons involved 
in the clean up of the plant site and the 30 km zone were exposed.  
Very extensive areas of
the former Soviet Union and beyond its 
frontiers were affected by radioactive fallout. <P>

"At the present time, nine  years later, many of the expected 
potential health effects of exposure to radiation have not become 
apparent because of the latencies for some radiation-induced cancers.  
The full impact of the accident will become apparent only after several
decades.  So far the health consequences are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>acute radiation sickness and burns to the skin from beta 
radioactivity to some 200 persons, causing 28 deaths from acute 
radiation syndrome; 
<LI>childhood thyroid cancer in children living in Belarus,
the northern districts of the Ukraine and parts of the border of the 
Russian Federation with Belarus and the Ukraine.  So far nearly 500 
cases of childhood thyroid cancer have been detected in a 
population of about 3 million children particularly at risk;
<LI>psycho-social effects from stress-related conditions, through 
lifestyle changes, to near complete social disintegration of communities. 
Some 10 million persons live in the most affected regions.
</UL>

<P>On the basis of past experience of exposure to radiation further 
effects may be observed.  The tissue most sensitive to radiation 
exposure, in addition to the thyroid and bone marrow, is the breast of 
young women. Populations within 100 km would be particularly at risk.  
The isotopes of iodine could contribute to breast dose at certain 
stages of development or during and after pregnancy. <P>

"The effects of beta-emitting hot particles on the induction skin and 
lung cancers is also a matter for concern.  Such hot particles were 
observed as far afield as Finland and animal experiments have shown 
them to be capable of inducing lung tumours."<P>

Due to the size of the exposed population, hitherto unrecognised effects 
of radiation resulting from the incorporation of the less well studied 
fission products may well become evident in due course.
