<H3>Disturbance By Grazing </H3>
<HR>

<P>
For the ELZ, these two facets of landuse, grazing and burning,
dominate. However within the ILZ, and particularly along the boundaries
of the two zones, grazing, and to a much lesser extent, burning,
assume dominance over clearing as disturbance agents. Therefore
even though the assessment was notionally reported only for the
ELZ, the condition of the uncleared grazing land on the outer
margins of the ILZ was taken into account.
<P>
Tenure as well as landcover type boundaries were used in the assessment.
By definition, the disturbance status of all Unused land was assessed
as the lowest class, slight.
<P>
This assessment was reported simply as a table of the absolute
and relative areas in the four disturbance classes: slight (little
or no detectable impact); substantial (detectable but localised
impact); significant (widespread significant landscape change);
indeterminate (unable to interpret).
<P>
These four classes were assigned disturbance ratings of 0, 1,
2, and 0, respectively. A numeric measure was calculated as the
sum of the products of the proportional distribution of areas
and the respective disturbance ratings above and has a potential
range of 0-200. The rating and score were then assigned thus:
0-50 was low (*); 50-100 was moderate (**); &gt;100 was high (***).

<P>
<B><A NAME="table14"></A>Table 14</B>: The distribution of relative
area (%) of the four disturbance levels for all landcover types
within the ELZ. The score was based on the sum of the products
of the percentage areas and the disturbance ratings, slight (0)
to significant (2), and assigned 0-50 was low (*); 50-100 was
moderate (**); &gt;100 was high (***).
