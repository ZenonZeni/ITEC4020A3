<p><font size="5">End the War</font><font size="6"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>New York Times</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">November 3, 1995<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">BOSTON -- </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Million Man March on Washington, a largely
middle-class gathering, left tormenting questions about the black
underclass. What can be done to break the cycle of despair in our
inner cities? What, especially, can be done for their lost young
men?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If we are prepared to look past shibboleths,
one answer should come to mind. That is to end the so-called war
on drugs. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Drugs are terrible. But it is not drugs that
have done the real damage to our society. It is the misbegotten
effort to use the criminal law against them.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We tried Prohibition to end alcohol abuse. It
brought so much crime that we quickly gave up the Noble
Experiment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition of drugs began in 1915. The
experiment has been going for 80 years now. and by every rational
test it is a ghastly failure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The huge amounts of money spent in recent years
on the drug war have not reduced addiction. Per capita use of
cocaine has in fact increased.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">And the effort to stop drug use by harsher and
harsher criminal penalties has had devastating side effects. It
has made importation and distribution of the forbidden products
immensely profitable. That in turn has lured large numbers of
young men, even children, into the trade.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We're giving these kids a criminal
identity,&quot; Joseph D. McNamara, former police chief in
Calif., said, &quot;when we should be trying to find every
possible way to keep them in school and get them into
employment!&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Mr. McNamara is now a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution in Stanford, Calif. Last May, Hoover put on a
conference about drug policy. The participants Included George
Shultz, the former Secretary of State, Milton Friedman, the
economist - both also at the Hoover Institution - and dozens of
police officials. The participants ended by favoring.
overwhelmingly, medical and educational alternatives to the war
on drugs. &quot;Any objective group that studies the war on drugs
has to recognize that it's a disaster.&quot; Mr. McNamara told
The Palo Alto (Calif.) Weekly. &quot;It is not stopping the
spread of drug abuse, It's causing a good deal more crime and
violence than we'd otherwise have, and it's having severe
negative effects on race relations in America.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Another terrible cost of the drug war is the
incarceration of enormous numbers of people. This country now has
more than one million prisoners, many of them sentenced to long
terms, for nonviolent drug crimes. It costs upward of $20,000 a
year for each one - and it will cost hundreds of billions to
build new prisons.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The racial impact of the drug war is
particularly devastating.. One third of this country's black men
between 20 and 29 are now in prison or under supervision of the
criminal justice system, most of them for drug crimes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Then there is the murderous quality of life in
urban ghettos. Guns accompany the drug trade, and small children
are incidental victims of the street battles that result. By one
estimate, we have 10,000 drug-related homicides a year.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If we began to decriminalize our drug laws.
there might be an increase, perhaps temporary, in casual use. But
against that possibility one has to weigh the great gains for
society in taking the profit out of the trade.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">That is one point. made in a compelling piece
on drugs in the October issue of The Washington Monthly. by
Joshua Wolf Shenk. It argues that we must try to limit drug use -
but not use methods that do more harm than good.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cigarettes have been found to addict young
users more than any other drug, Mr. Shenk points out; and 400,000
Americans die prematurely each year because of tobacco use. But
we fight that problem not by criminal prohibition but by rules
and, education, which have substantially reduced smoking.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Politically, it is very hard to talk sense
about drugs. President Clinton has just signed legislation
rejecting a recommendation of the Federal Sentencing Commission
to end the grotesque disparity of sentences for crack and regular
cocaine: up to 100 times more for the former.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But some day we may have political leaders
brave enough to do what most of the police authorities and judges
who are on the front line-have concluded is essential - stop the
self destruction of the war on drugs. <br>
