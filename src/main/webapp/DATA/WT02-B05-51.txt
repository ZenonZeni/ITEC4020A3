<center><h3>CDT LED COALITION SENDS LETTER TO<br>

SENATORS EXON AND PRESSLER <p></h3>

<b>MESSAGE:  <blink>REMOVE S. 314 FROM FAST TRACK</blink></b></center>





<p>The Interactive Working Group (a coalition of public interest 

organizations, members of the computer and communications industry, and 

associations representing librarians and the press, chaired by the 

Center For Democracy and Technology) today sent a letter to Senators 

Pressler, Exon, and the Senate Commerce Committee. The letter expresses 

serious concerns about S. 314 (the "Communications Decency Act of 1995") 

from the standpoint of the First Amendment and the viability of the 

entire communications industry. Because of these and other concerns, the 

coalition asked Senator Pressler and Exon not to incorporate S. 314 into 

Senate telecommunications reform legislation which is expected to be 

introduced later this month.<p>



The letter and a list of signatories are attached below. <p>



S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and harassment on 

telephone services to all telecommunications providers and expand 

criminal liability to all content carried by all forms of 

telecommunications networks. The bill would amend Section 223 of the 

Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take 

steps to prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and 

criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate telephone lines.<p>



If enacted, S. 314 would compel service providers to severely restrict 

your online activities. Your access to email, discussion lists, usenet, 

the world wide web, gopher, and ftp archives would be substantially 

reduced or cut off entirely. The bill would also force providers to 

closely monitor and pre-screen your electronic mail, and refuse to 

transmit any message or other content which may be considered to be 

indecent.<p>



This bill poses a significant threat to freedom of speech and the free 

flow of information in cyberspace. The bill also raises fundamental 

questions about the right of government to control content on 

communications networks, as well as the locus of liability for content 

carried in these new communications media.

<center><b>INTERACTIVE WORKING GROUP LETTER</b></center><p>





March 2, 1995<p>



Chairman Larry Pressler<br>

Senate Commerce Committee<br>

United States Senate

Washington, DC<p>



Senator James Exon<br>

United States Senate<br>

528 Hart Senate Office Building<br>

Washington, DC<p>



Dear Chairman Pressler and Senator Exon:<p> 



We write regarding the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314), 

introduced recently by Senator James Exon and Senator Slade Gorton. We 

request that such legislation not be considered as part of the fast 

track telecommunications reform measure now before the Commerce 

Committee. The undersigned members of the computer and communications 

industry, the press, and the public interest community believe that this 

legislation raises fundamental questions regarding the involvement of 

government in content regulation in new interactive media. <p>



Developing means for detecting and holding wrong-doers responsible for 

illegal activity, and permitting parents to control access by their 

children to adult material while still preserving our constitutional 

liberties, are important goals shared by many in our society. However, 

the choice of methods for achieving these goals raises serious free 

speech and censorship problems. Our commitment is to work with you and 

your colleagues to resolve these issues in ways which will enable 

individual and parental choice, without impairing the free flow of 

information or stifling development of emerging technology through 

bureaucratic regulation.<p>



In recognition of the seriousness of these issues, the undersigned 

organizations have formed a working group to identify legal and 

regulatory options that maximize parental control, individual 

accountability, and the free flow of information in new communication 

technologies. We are encouraged that new interactive communications 

technologies -- including online services and interactive television 

offered by cable, telephone companies, and others in the public sector 

-- already offer technological means to give consumers choice over the 

content that they receive and enable parents to control access to 

controversial material. Many more such features are in development. 

Market signals already indicate to those of us who are building the 

Information Superhighway that users want choice of programming and 

control over the materials to which their children are exposed. 

Information providers in the public and private sector are working to 

meet these needs.<p>



We plan to devote intensive effort toward developing comprehensive 

solutions to the problems raised by S. 314. Desirable solutions will 

take advantage of the empowering potential of new technology for 

increased user control over programming and information content. 

However, we must emphasize that we strongly disagree with the approach 

embodied in this legislation that would in effect require those who 

merely provide the means of transmitting messages to censor the content 

of such materials, as well as become liable for the criminal actions of 

others based solely on the content of the messages transmitted. Applying 

the regulatory models developed for today's mass media to the 

interactive media of tomorrow, will only serve to thwart the development 

of new media.<p>



In the coming year, we hope to have the opportunity to work diligently 

with you and other policy makers to assure that the empowering potential 

of interactive media is achieved, and to arrive at comprehensive, 

forward looking solutions to the issues before us without jeopardizing 

fundamental First Amendment values.<p>
