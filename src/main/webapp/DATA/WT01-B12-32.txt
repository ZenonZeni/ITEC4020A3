 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for the health and well being of entire civilizations. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits here and now.</P>
<P>  To the best of our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kind of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.   These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, antioxidants, and at times, concentrated tissue nutrients when appropriate.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</H2>
<P>  Problems associated with the respiratory tract are among the most common health problems today. These maladies arise because of allergies, air pollution, smoking, infection, decreased immunity and poor nutrition, to name a few.</P>
<P>  Oxygen is the most important nutrient of all. The lungs pick up oxygen from the air we breath and expel carbon dioxide from the blood stream. Without adequate supplies of oxygen to the tissues, health simply cannot be maintained.  In our highly industrialized society, our lungs are exposed to much higher levels of pollutants than before. This excessive strain causes our lungs to become irritated, and they begin to malfunction or degenerate. When they do not function properly, lungs cannot absorb oxygen from the air efficiently to nourish our bodies.</P>
<P>  The major percentage of our population lives in large cities,  where  the  smog  and  air pollution  levels  are extremely high. If you live in Los Angeles, Denver, or Chicago, the pollution in the air you breath is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. Keep in mind that even one puff of cigarette smoke supplies about one hundred billion anti-oxidant hits, and the first hit is on the cells of the lungs as air is inhaled. Tons of lead are put into our atmosphere every year from automobile exhaust. It is known that if you live within 500 feet of a busy highway, the lead levels in the air are more than 50 times higher than average.</P>
<P>  Anyone who has suffered from colds, cough, flu, bronchitis, asthma, or pneumonia knows what a blessing it is to have healthy lungs and proper breathing.</P>
<P>  Vitamin A deficiency can be one of the major reasons for lung deterioration. It is the most important nutrient that supports epithelia tissues including the lining of the lungs.  The Vitamin A in LUNG FORMULA is in the form of its natural plant source, Beta-Carotene. Life Plus LUNG FORMULA contains a representative amount to insure it is presented concurrently with the herbs in LUNG FORMULA. Larger amounts are intentionally not included to guard against obtaining too much Vitamin A from your overall nutritional supplement program.  More can easily be obtained by taking <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>, an ideal companion to LUNG FORMULA.</P>
<P>  LUNG FORMULA contains five natural herbs that have long been used because of their special nutritional values for the lungs. These herbs include Pleurisy Root, Slippery Elm, Fenugreek, Thyme and Yerba Santa. Smokers and individuals who live or work in large urban areas  should  consider  taking  Life  Plus  LUNG FORMULA.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Life Plus LUNG FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LUNG FORMULA</H2>
<P>   It is usually recommended to take one or two tablets three times a day.   More can be taken if needed, especially in special times of need. For long term usage, it is recommended to take Life Plus LUNG FORMULA with additional sources of vitamin A, vitamin C, other antioxidants  and  enzymes.    This  can  best  be accomplished by taking <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>  , <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> and <A HREF="msoma.htm">SOMAZYME</A>.</P>
