<LI> <B>Curriculum:</B> Examination of the curriculum is important to determine appropriate instructional objectives and activities suitable for cooperative learning<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>Instruction and Materials:</B> Cooperative learning activities can be used as guided practice activities as part of direct instruction or as an independent practice activity. In the former, students need practice opportunities to achieve mastery with teacher monitoring of newly introduced skills or concepts. In the latter, students understand the skill or concept and do not necessarily require constant teacher monitoring. The following should be considered:<BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> how long the activity will last<BR>
<LI> how many activities (and/or weeks) will be necessary to teach or reinforce a skill or concept<BR>
<LI> how frequently during the week activities will be scheduled<BR>
<LI> when during the day such activities will occur<BR>
<LI> what the cooperative learning goals will be in academics, oral language, and/or  social/collaborative skills<BR>
<LI> how positive interdependence will be fostered<BR>
<LI> how students will be held accountable for the activity<BR>
<LI> how group processing will be evaluated<BR>
<LI> what materials and resources will be needed<BR>
</OL><BR>
<LI> <B>Student roles:</B> Roles are important because they define appropriate actions and behaviors. They also provide participants with ownership in the activity.  Each role should be defined clearly, and they should be rotated so that students have opportunities for the various responsibilities.  Suggested roles include:<BR>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> leader<BR>
<LI> materials person<BR>
<LI> record keeper<BR>
<LI> time keeper<BR>
<LI> spokesperson<BR>
<LI> runner<BR>
</OL><BR>
<LI> <B>Environment:</B> The idea is to ensure that students are in social groupings (e.g., the furniture should be physically situated so that students can look at each other).<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>Student groupings:</B> researchers suggest that heterogeneous groupings work best because higher-ability students can be paired with lower-ability students. Teacher must consider the academic, behavioral, and social strengths and weaknesses of each student. When initiating cooperative learning activities, start with smaller groups until students learn how to work together within their assigned roles. The following questions should be considered when designing student groupings:<BR>
<OL>
<LI> What are my goals for the cooperative learning activity?<BR>
<LI> What are each student's strengths and weaknesses?<BR>
<LI> How many students do I want on each team?<BR>
<LI> How many materials and resources do I have available?<BR>
<LI> Do I have a role for each member group?<BR>
<LI> How long will these cooperative groupings stay together?<BR>
</OL><BR>
<LI> <B>Management:</B> Effective management techniques are critical in any instructional setting, especially during cooperative learning activities. Teachers can address the following questions when planning their management program:<BR>
<OL>
<LI> What will the rules and consequences be for cooperative learning activities?<BR>
<LI> How will students move to and from cooperative groupings (transition)?<BR>
<LI> How will materials distribution be handled?<BR>
<LI> What will students do with completed work?<BR>
<LI> How will inappropriate behavior be handled?<BR>
</OL>
