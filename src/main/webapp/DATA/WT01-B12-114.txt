Kemper manages seven closed-end funds designed to meet varying financial goals. Six funds invest in the fixed-income or municipal markets while one fund invests primarily in Spanish equities. 
<P>
A closed-end fund differs from an "open-end" fund (commonly referred to as a "mutual fund") in several important ways:<BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>A closed-end fund is usually capitalized through a one-time public offering. New shares may be created only in certain circumstances -- to satisfy dividend reinvestment plan requirements with respect to income and capital gains distributions and occasionally rights offerings, for example. By contrast, an open-end fund continuously issues new shares.
<LI>Once issued, the shares of a closed-end fund are not redeemable by the fund and are exchangeable only in the open market, generally by a listing on a recognized stock exchange.  Shares of Kemper's closed-end funds are traded on the <A HREF="http://www.nyse.com/">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.chicagostockex.com/">Chicago Stock Exchange (CSE)</A>. Shares of an open-end fund, by contrast, are redeemable by the fund at any time.
<LI>Because the supply of shares of a closed-end fund is finite, the market price of a closed-end fund share is based upon the forces of supply and demand. 
Shares may trade at either above or below their net asset value (NAV) based on their perceived value in the marketplace. This price differential is referred to as a premium or discount to NAV.  Again, by contrast, an open-end fund stands ready at all times to redeem its shares at their current NAV.
<LI>Because all trading of a closed-end fund's shares takes place in the open market, the portfolio manager of a closed-end fund does not need to worry about maintaining cash balances to fund share redemptions. This tends to give the manager more latitude to fully invest the portfolio and to consider a broader range of portfolio securities.
