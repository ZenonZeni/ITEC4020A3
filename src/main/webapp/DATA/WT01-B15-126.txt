Dear Reader:
<p>
Enclosed is a copy of the <a href= "pplan1.htm">draft Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan-Revision 1.</a> 
This revised Plan would supersede the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan
dated December 1994.  The revised Plan reflects the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget
request for the Program, as well as the guidance provided by the Congress in the Fiscal Year 1996
appropriations legislation.
<p>
This Administration is committed to resolving the complex and important issue of nuclear waste
in a timely and sensible manner.  The President's budget request for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997
supports an aggressive and efficient program to reach an early decision on the suitability of the
Yucca Mountain site in Nevada as a geologic repository.  Such a decision advances the Nation's
long-standing goal to achieve permanent disposal of radioactive waste.  The out-year budget
levels in the revised Plan will be accommodated within the Administration's overall discretionary
out-year budget levels identified in the President's FY 1997 request.
<p>
The strategy outlined in this revised Plan requires that activities be prioritized to enable the
Program to resolve the most important remaining technical questions concerning the viability of a
repository at Yucca Mountain by 1998.  If the Yucca Mountain site proves to be viable, then
implementation of this revised Program Plan would result in a formal application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for the permit to begin constructing the repository in 2002. 
Emplacement of nuclear waste would begin in 2010.
<p>
The ability to focus on the most critical scientific and technical questions at the Yucca Mountain
site is made possible by a decade of scientific work at the site, which includes extensive
underground exploration.  The approach outlined in the revised Plan will enable the Program to
reach a license application for about one billion dollars less than the previous Program Plan would
have required.
<p>
With regard to the issue of interim storage of commercial and Naval Reactor spent fuel, the
Administration strongly believes that any siting decision for such a facility must be based on
objective science-based criteria and that such a decision should not be made prior to the
completion of the scientific work necessary to determine the viability of the Yucca Mountain
repository site.  Prior to the completion of this scientific and technical work, the Administration
believes any activities related to the development of an interim nuclear waste storage facility must
be limited to non-site specific design and engineering activities.
<p>
This revised Plan is intended to ensure that the momentum that has been achieved in the Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program will be maintained and enhanced in the years ahead.  
However, the Department of Energy recognizes that the assumptions underlying this revised Plan
may turn out not to be valid.  Should this occur, the revised Plan will be updated and modified as
appropriate.
<p>
If you have any questions about our revised Program Plan, please contact Charles Teclaw, Office
of Program Management and Integration, Planning Division at  (202) 586-7292.
