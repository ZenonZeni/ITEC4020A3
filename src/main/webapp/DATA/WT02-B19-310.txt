Dr. Pat Morrissey<BR>
Subcommitee on Disability Policy<BR>
422 Dirksen Senate Office Building<BR>
Washington, D.C.  20510<P>
Dear Dr. Morrissey:<P>
The Council for Exceptional Children commends the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy for their dedication and thoughtfulness in crafting a reauthorization proposal for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  CEC appreciates the Subcommittee's openness and accessibility to the disability and education communities in its deliberations on complex and difficult issues.  We have forwarded our comments on the overall reauthorization draft and hope that they were constructive and helpful to you.  In responding to the discipline language that the Subcommittee has recently released, we are hopeful that our comments will again be taken into serious consideration when crafting the final reauthorization bill.<P>
CEC was pleased to have been invited and taken part in numerous discussion groups on the issue of the discipline of children with disabilities.  It was beneficial to have both leaders in the disability community and in the education community to discuss a delicate and highly controversial issue as a group.  Because we are both disability advocates and primarily school-based, CEC has always promoted the interaction between these two overlapping communities.  We thank the Subcommittee for proposing the forum and providing necessary leadership.   CEC hopes that the forum model will be used throughout the reauthorization of IDEA to discuss important issues affecting the education of children with disabilities.<P>
Although CEC believes that progress has been made in addressing the discipline of children with disabilities in the Senate's draft language, we continue to have major concerns with some of the directions taken.  CEC has been in the forefront of addressing the need for amendment language to allow alternative procedures for disciplining children with disabilities who pose a safety concern in the classroom.  In our January 1995 document <I>Recommendations for the Reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act </I>we called for an expansion of the existing alternative procedures for children with disabilities who bring firearms into school, to include a 45-day alternative education setting for a child with a disability who is a "danger to self or others." <I> </I> We continue to believe that there needs to be alternative procedures for children with disabilities who bring a weapon to school or present a danger to self or others.  We commend the Subcommittee for addressing these issues; however, we strongly oppose portions of the Subcommittee's draft language that may have unintended negative consequences.  Following are our major concerns:<BR>
   <I>      </I><BR>
o<B>     Expansion of Behavior that Would Elicit Alternative Procedures.</B>  As mentioned above, CEC strongly supports alternative procedures for disciplining children with disabilities who present a danger in the classroom.  The Subcommittee language, however, would go much farther by allowing alternative procedures to be used for children with disabilities who bring drugs into the classroom or who are "seriously disruptive."  CEC believes that current provisions under IDEA provide adequate procedures for children with disabilities involved in these behaviors.  We believe that the term "seriously disruptive" is vague and could be misused to pull children with disabilities out of appropriate educational environments.  For instance, to have a successful inclusion program, schools must provide the necessary support to<BR>

teachers to include a child with a disability in a regular classroom.  Assisting a child with a disability to adapt to a new setting takes time, patience, and understanding.  We are afraid that if a placement setting is not immediately successful, the alternative discipline procedures could be used to terminate the placement precipitously.  For those students for whom the placement is clearly not appropriate, IDEA currently provides a framework for parents and schools to work together to find an appropriate setting. <BR>
<BR>
o<B>     Cessation of Educational Services</B>.  The Subcommittee language would allow the cessation of educational services for a child with a disability who is determined to be involved with dangerous weapons or drugs.  CEC opposes any language that calls for the cessation of educational services to children with disabilities.  We strongly believe that a child with a disability remains entitled to a free, appropriate public education whether or not the child is being disciplined.  In fact, to those who argue that there should not be a dual system that treats a child with a disability differently from a child without a disability in this area, we heartily agree.  No child should be expelled from school and unable to receive educational services, whether the child has a disability or not. <BR>
<BR>
o<B>     Involvement of Local School District Director of Special Education</B>.   The Subcommittee draft language would require a principal to determine if a child with a disability has been involved with dangerous weapons, drugs, behavior resulting in serious injury, or is seriously disruptive, in consultation with individuals with knowledge of the child's disability, the chair of the child's IEP team and, <I>if appropriate</I>, the agency's director of special education.  CEC strongly believes that the local school district's director of special education should be required to be a part of this determination process.  The expertise and knowledge the special education director would bring to the process will be invaluable and will promote sound and balanced decision-making.<BR>
<BR>
o<B>     Manifestation Determination</B>.  CEC is concerned with the Subcommittee's draft language addressing the  manifestation determination of a child with a disability.  Our members who are involved in such determinations currently have indicated how difficult it is to determine whether the behavior of a child with a disability stems from that disability.  It is extremely problematic, even with the best expertise, to separate the behavior of a child with a disability from the disability itself.  For this reason, CEC opposes amending the current statute to require that such a manifestation determination take place.  We join with the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities in believing that the ultimate result of attempting to make such a determination will be children with disabilities inappropriately denied educational services, as well as an escalation of wasted time, funding and other resources.<BR>
<BR>
CEC hopes that our comments and concerns will be helpful to you in crafting the final legislation.  Once again, we wish to state our admiration for the Subcommittee's leadership and endurance on this very difficult issue.  CEC  continues to believe that the final modifications to the 20 year old IDEA will be beneficial and will assist in furthering the education of children with disabilities.  We look forward to continuing to work with you on the discipline issue and any other issues involving the education of children with exceptionalities.<P>
Sincerely,<P>
<BR>

Assistant Executive Director
