<H2>PRELIMINARY PROTOCOL FOR TASK 2</H2>
<P>
PRELIMINARY PROTOCOL FOR TASK 2
<P>
IMR - TASC method Protocol
<P>
1. Hydrographic measurements
<P>
1.1 CTD. A 12 pp manual is available presenting 
<UL>
<LI>a) Procedure for identification and logging of the state of
CTD systems, salinometers and water water sampling equipment 
<LI>b) Procedure for handling of CTD systems and water sampling
bottles (f.ex. Niskin bottles) 
<LI>c) Procedure for transfer of standards for measuring temperature,
conductivity, and pressure 
<LI>d) Procedure for field calibration of CTD-systems 
<LI>e) Procedure for transfer of calibration data to data files
</UL>
<P>
Data on temperature and salinity will be collected with CTD (Sea
Bird or Neil Brown) or water sampling bottles (Nansen or Niskin
bottles) equipped with reversing termometers. Calibration is carried
out according to the IMR standard and involves the taking of salinity
samples for calibration at each station. The CTDs used at IMR
at present are Neil Brown Instrument Systems, NBIS MkIII, and
Sea-Bird's 911plus
<P>
1.2 ADCP<BR>
R/V &#171;Johan Hjort&#187; and &#171;G.O.Sars&#187; are equipped
with ADCP model R.D.Instruments RD-VM 150 kHz. The instrument
is operated according to the IMR protocol.
<P>
2 . Nutrient measurements<BR>
Water for nutrient analyses is sampled by a rosette system carried
on the CTDs, and on deck collected into 20 ml polyethylene vials,
added 0.2 ml chloroform and kept refrigerated at 4oC in the dark
until analysis is carried out. Nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, and
silicic acid are analysed using standard methods (Strickland and
Parsons, 1972) adapted to an autoanalyzer (F&oslash;yn <I>et al</I>.,
1981). Equipment improvements in relation to the 1981-paper are
mainly new autosampling, detection and computing units from SANplus
Segmented Flow Analyzer, Skalar Analytic B.V., the Netherlands.
Also a new modification has been applied in the analysis of nitrate.
The Cd-reduction column has been replaced by a Cd-tube manufactured
by Alpkem Inc. and the segmentation of the flow was achieved by
pumping nitrogen gas instead of air as in the previous version
of the method.
<P>
The precision of the analyses has been monitored by running ten
fresh replicate samples from a single Niskin bottle several times
during some cruises. The precision obtained for the different
analyses at full scale was better than 0.1% for nitrite, 0.25%
for nitrate, 0.5% for phosphate and 0.2% for silicic acid.
<P>
The reproducibility of the analyses has been assessed by running
onboard a set of control samples which were newly made every day
from stock solutions prepared ashore. The control samples were
prepared in low nutrient sea water and were run in the same way
as the other samples. The obtained reproducibility for a particular
cruise (one standard deviartion) for the different analyses usually
is as follows:

3. Measurements for chlorohyll a and primary production
<P>
3.1 Chlorophyll a and paheopigments<BR>
Water samples for chlorophyll a (263 &Iuml; 3ml) are filtered
through glassfiber filters (GF/F) and kept frozen (-18 oC) for
a maximum period of four weeks until analysis ashore. In the laboratory
the filters are extracted overnight with 10 ml of 90% acetone
in the dark and at 4oC. Periodic shaking assures a complete extraction.
The extracts are then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 5000 g and
measured fluorometrically with a Turner Designs 10 AU-R (exication
filter CS 2-60; emission filter CS 2-64) both before and after
acidification with one drop of 5% v/v hydrochloric acid. The fluorometer
is calibrated against a pure chlorophyll a (Sigma Inc) extract
which concentration is measured spectrophotometrically using the
equations of Jeffrey and Humphrey (1985). The final calculations
of chlorophyll a and phaeopigments are done using the equations
proposed by Lorenzen (1966).

3.2 Primary production<BR>
Primary production is measured by the in situ technique (SIS)
with an incubator that simulates both light quality and intensity.
The incubator is cooled with running sea water from about 5 meter
depth. Samples (120 ml) are obtained at 9 light depths from Niskin
bottles, poured carefully into class bottles, added redioactive
carbon ( &#184; 4&#181;Ci per sample) and incubated for 24 hours.
The samples are then filtrated through membrane filters (0.45
&#181;m pore size) and kept frozen into scintillation vials until
analysis ashore. In the laboratory the sampels are fumed for 30
minutes under concentrated hydrochloric acid, added scintillation
cocktail (Optima Gold) and then measured in a Packard Tri-Carb
scintillation meter using the channel ratio method for correcting
for quenching.

4. Collecting zooplankton
<P>
4.1 Sampling devices<BR>
4.1.1 MOCNESS 1m2<BR>
A description of the MOCNESS (Multiple Opening Closing Net and
Environmental Sensing System) is given in Wiebe et al.(1976, 1985).
Calibration of the TSK (Tsurumi-Seiki-flowmeters takes place at
the start of each cruise, following a protocol at IMR. The MOCNESS
is usually equipped with 8 nets (180 &#181;m mesh size). In routine
surveys the MOCNESS is used to 700 m depth, by oblique hauls the
following depth intervals are sampled

At shallower echo depths the number of nets in use is usually
reduced accordingly.

the MOCNESS, an apparatus for sampling zooplankton and micronekton.

<P>
4.1.2 Plankton nets<BR>
In routine plankton surveys in addition to MOCNESS we use an WP-2
net, 180 &#181;m mesh size, 56 cm diameter. The nets are usually
neither euipped with closing mechanisms nor flowmeters. Both closing
devices and flowmeters (TSK or General Oceanics) can be mounted
if so desired. The WP-2 net is towed vertically from the desired
depth and up to the surface at a speed of c. 30 m min-1.
<P>
4.1.3 Multinet (Multi plankton sampler)<BR>
The Multinet is an opening/closing net equipped with five nets
180 &#181;m mesh. The mouth opening is 0.25 m2. At present the
device is not equipped with flowmeters. The MPS is towed by a
multiconductor cable and the nets changings are controlled with
a Deck Command Unit from on board the ship. For depth information
a Scanmar pressure sensor unit is mounted on the Multinet, i.e.
the depth is read from the Scanmar deck unit on board the ship.
At IMR the Multinet is towed vertically from about 1000 m to surface,
at a speed of c. 30 m min -1. Within the TASC project we would
prefer using the Multinet to at least 2000 m depth, depending
upon finance another cable might be provided. 
<P>
4.1.4 Plankton pumps<BR>
A small ITT Flygt pump ( FLYGT GP 51, capacity c. 100 l min-1
at lifting height 6 m) is used for collecting copepod nauplii
at disrete depths down to about 50 m. The pump is connected to
a filtering system on board the ship, where the water is filtered
over 90 &#181;m mesh for retaining copepod (i.e. <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>)
nauplii. Usually a 26 liter water sample is filtered from each
depth.
<P>
4.1.5 Niskin water bottles<BR>
Small organisms (copepod nauplii) are commonly sampled by means
of Niskin water bottles, size 5 and 30 liters. The filtering takes
place in a net placed within a large jar on deck. With this rather
simple equipment samples may be taken from any depth irrespective
of hose lenghts, pressure allowance of pumps etc.
<P>
5. The treatment of zooplankton samples
<P>
5.1 Samples for biomass estimation<BR>
At once the sample is on deck scyphozoans, ctenophores etc. are
removed, identified, and measured (volume). The remaining sample
is parted into two equal parts (Motoda plankton splitter). One
half is preserved in 4 % formaldehyde, the other part is parted
into size fractions by filtering through 2000 &#181;m, 1000 &#181;m
and 180 &#181;m sieves. From the 2000 &#181;m fraction large organisms
as euphausiids, fish, and shrimps are removed and measured (length).
The three different size fractions, euphausiids, fishes, and shrimps
are transferred to preweighed alumina trays and dried for 20 hours
at 70 oC, before weighing using a Cahn microbalance. 
<P>
5.2. Samples for RNA/DNA analyses - lipid analyses<BR>
Samples are carried out on live material, usually from MOCNESS.
Single animals are identified and length measured, transferred
to cryotubes and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen or in a
-80 oC freezer. During sorting (species and stage identification)
the animals are kept in a cold stage by means of ice blocks. In
case of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> we use cop. stage IV and V. The
same procedure is followed for lipid analyses. When analysing
several specimens are pooled to obtain sufficient quantity for
lipid analyses. 5.3 Samples for genetic analyses<BR>
Live organisms are dried for excess seawater. In some cases a
part of the MOCNESS sample is used without previous identification
of specimens, identification etc. takes place ashore at a later
stage. In other cases the live organisms are identified to species
before further treatment. The organisms are transferred to small
glass bottles in 95% ethyl alcohol. After 24 hours the alcohol
is drained off and replaced with fresh alcohol. The analysis takes
place ashore, at IMR. In case of <I>C. finmarchcicus</I> the analyses
are performed on adult females.The total procedure is according
to Ann Bucklin/Rolf Sundt.
<P>
5.4 Samples for taxonomic analyses<BR>
Large gelatinous organisms are already removed and identified
before preservation onboard the ship. The preserved sample is
filtrated on a 2000 &#181;m sieve, large organisms as euphausiids,
fish (usually lanternfish and pearlside), shrimps (usually Sergestes
spp. and Pasiphaea spp), amphipods (usually Themisto spp.) are
removed identified, measured and counted. Except when the sample
is very small the remainder is then split a number of times with
a Motoda splitter and a aliquot is identified for species or higher
taxonomic groups. The splitting with the Motoda splitter usually
takes place in two steps: 1) A moderate splitting with regard
to the most important species ( priority 1) 2) A further splitting
for analysing the usually numerous smaller organisms (priority
2)
<P>
In priority 1 we usually split the total sample appropriate times
to ensure a sufficient numbers of <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>
in the final aliquot, at least 100 specimens. In priority 2 further
splitting takes place so that the numerous smaller organisms like
copepod nauplii, Oithona etc. can be effectively enumerated and
identified.
<P>
Most copepods in the sample are identified to species. <I>C. finmarchicus,
C.hyperboreus, C.glacialis </I>are also indtified to cop.stages.
Most other copepods (Metridia, Pseudocalanus, Euchaeta a.o.) are
identified to genus and cop.stage, while in routine surveys crustacean
nauplii are identified to class. At present <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
and <I>C. glacialis</I> are separated by means of length frequency
distributions, however, since they to some extent overlap in size,
attemps are now made to discriminate between the species by genetic
analyses. <I>C. helgolandicus</I> is rather scarce in our waters,
no attempts have been made to discriminate between <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
and <I>C. helgolandicus</I>.
<P>
Other organisms are identified to class or family; euphausiids
and some amphipods also to species.
<P>
The above mentioned procedures constitute a brief extract of several
protocols or manuals at IMR, of which most are written in Norwegian
only.
