<STRONG>Lie: </STRONG>Marijuana is an effective medication for nausea associated
with cancer chemotherapy. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Truth: </STRONG>Oncologists overwhelmingly reject the idea of prescribing
smoked marijuana. Crude marijuana contains over 400 different chemicals
THC, the main active ingredient in crude marijuana, is available as the
prescription drug Marinol, for the treatment of nausea associated with medications
are available and preferred by oncologists. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><STRONG>Lie: </STRONG>Marijuana is a beneficial treatment for glaucoma.
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Truth:</STRONG> There is no scientific evidence that marijuana prevents
the progression of visual loss in glaucoma. While marijuana, as well as
alcohol and a host of other substances, can lower intraocular eye pressure,
the medication must be carefully tailored to the individual to prevent further
eye damage. Besides numerous adverse side effects of smoking marijuana,
the dose cannot be controlled. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><STRONG>Lie: </STRONG>Crude marijuana is effective in treating the wasting
syndrome associated with AIDS. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Truth: </STRONG>Smoking marijuana compromises the immune system
and puts AIDS patients at significant risk for infections and respiratory
problems. Current scientific studies show that Marinol (oral THC), which
is available to treat AIDS wasting syndrome, is effective in increasing
appetite but is ineffective in increasing weight gain. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><STRONG>Lie: </STRONG>The government is withholding important medicine
from suffering patients by not allowing the prescribing of marijuana. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Truth: </STRONG>Crude marijuana does not meet the scientific requirements
for efficacy, quality, purity and safety necessary to be considered medicine.
It is neither compassionate nor medically responsible to prescribe harmful
impure substances to ill people. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><STRONG>Lie:</STRONG> Smoking marijuana reduces the spasticity associated
with multiple sclerosis. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Truth:</STRONG> In a recent double-blind scientific study, the latest
hi- tech electronic monitoring equipment was used to determine if smoked
marijuana had any benefit in treating spasticity in patients with MS. The
study found that all patients receiving marijuana rather than placebo perceived
their spasticity to be lessened, when in actuality, it was made worse. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><STRONG>Lie:</STRONG> Many doctors want crude marijuana available so
they can prescribe it to their patients. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Truth: </STRONG>Most doctors want the best medicine possible for
their patients. Although synthetic marijuana (THC) in a pure and standardized
form is available by prescription, it is often the last choice of doctors,
because many better medicines are available. The American Medical Association,
the Federal Drug Administration, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society,
the American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and
the American Cancer Society have all rejected the use of smoked marijuana
as a medicine. Marijuana is not recognized as a medicine in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references or textbooks. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>BY ANY MODERN MEDICAL STANDARD, MARIJUANA IS NO MEDICINE. </CENTER>
</H3>
<H2><CENTER>Drug Watch International Position Statement on Medical Marijuana
Use. </CENTER>
</H2>
Leaf marijuana is not medicine. It is a harmful psychoactive drug, composed
of over 400 different chemicals, which should not be used by anyone, especially
by people who are ill. <BR>
<BR>
BACKGROUND: <BR>
<BR>
In the last several years, the public has seen the issue of the therapeutic
applications of leaf marijuana reach the level of discussions of public
policy. This movement has been fueled by the forces seeking to legalize
marijuana. By having marijuana listed as medicine, they hope to &quot;legitimize&quot;
marijuana use. <BR>
<BR>
RATIONALE:<BR>
<BR>
Smoked marijuana is neither an acceptable medical treatment nor an alternative
medical treatment for any illness. <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana use has serious health consequences. Concentration, motor coordination,
memory, lungs, reproductive and immune systems are all adversely impacted
by marijuana use; marijuana is addictive. <BR>
<BR>
Physicians who treat people for cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and other diseases
do not favor the use of marijuana. <BR>
<BR>
Not one American health organization accepts marijuana as medicine. These
include the American Medical Association, National Multiple Sclerosis Society,
American Glaucoma Society, American Academy of Ophthalmology and American
Cancer Society. <BR>
<BR>
FDA/DEA have repeatedly rejected marijuana for medicinal use Marijuana fails
to meet any of the Drug Enforcement Administration's requirements or Federal
Drug Administration's eight criteria for approving drugs for medical use.
<BR>
<BR>
Even Marinol, a synthetic form of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), available
by prescription for treating nausea, has far more negative health effects
than other available agents. <BR>
<BR>
There are numerous safer and more effective anti-nausea agents These include
prochlorperazine (Compazine), metaclopramide (Reglan), lorazepam, corticosteroids,
thiethylperazine (Torecan), ondansetron (Zofran), promethazine (Phenergan),
perphenazine (Trilafon), and chlorpromazine (Thorazine). <BR>
<BR>
The pro-drug lobby exploits the suffering of patients with chronic illness
with false promises about marijuana as a medicine. They have stated that
they are pushing marijuana as medicine and using it as a &quot;red herring&quot;
as part of a strategy to legalize marijuana for general use. <BR>
