<BLOCKQUOTE><H1>Conclusion</H1>
The American metropolis is at a turning point. In many
cities, the very convenience of the car has begun to
turn on itself, as congestion keeps those 100
mile-per-hour cars crawling along at 10 or 15 miles per
hour. In Los Angeles, average highway speed is only 28
miles per hour, and it is projected to slow to 18 mph
early in the next century. The real, grisly glimpse of a
car-saturated 
future lies in today's Bangkok, where car toilets are
becoming popular, since commutes can take many hours.
<P>
It is possible to reverse the trends that are locking us
in cars and isolating us in our own communities. It will
take major policy changes and a willingness to abandon
parochial concerns; instead we need to embrace an
approach that integrates a broad range of solutions.
Perhaps most important, reviving the American metropolis
will require courage, will, and a collective vision; we
need a sense that it is possible to shape our common
destiny.
<P>
The staff and board of the Energy Foundation recognize
the difficulty of changing the transportation system,
and we understand how tightly our economy and mobility
are interwoven. But we are committed to supporting
efforts that can solve difficult problems without making
others worse, that can untangle the gridlock on the
street and in the legislatures, and that can help make
the nation's cities and communities more livable.
