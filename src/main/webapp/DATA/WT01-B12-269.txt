The daily news is filled with economic reports that could conceivably
affect the value of your investments. What should keep you up at night
and what can you afford to ignore? We'll attempt to turn the lights on
some of the risks that could threaten your sleep.
<P>

Risks are inherent in all our activities. As individuals and as
investors, we must understand those risks particularly as they apply to
an economic forecast. At Kemper, our outlook is for steady economic
growth without a rapid rise in inflation. 
<P>

But what are the risks associated with this forecast? How can we
recognize the risks? If risks become realities, what are we likely to
see? Three risks to our forecast are associated with inflation
expectations, the dollar and consumer confidence.
<P>

Inflation expectations are a key factor influencing the trend in
long-term interest rates. Recent data suggest that Americans expect
inflation to rise at a rate of three percent or so. The risk is that
inflation could rise by more than that. 
<P>

You've probably heard or read the news that prices on commodities,
particularly those used in the production of goods for consumers and
businesses, have risen recently. Prices paid and prices received by
purchasing managers have been higher in recent months. Energy prices are
also up. 
<P>

If these commodity prices are perceived as becoming widespread or begin
to filter into consumer products, then inflation expectations may rise.
Investors can be expected to start to factor higher inflation into their
pricing and they'll require higher interest rates to compensate for the
risk of such higher inflation. If that happens, interest rates could
rise higher than our forecast expects and this could reduce economic
growth more than expected.
<P>

Another recent economic newsmaker has been the value of the U.S. dollar.
For some time, financial markets were concerned about the dollar's
depreciation against the Japanese yen. 
<P>

Dollar fluctuations are normal. Each year the dollar appreciates against
some currencies while it depreciates against other currencies. 
<P>

What happens if the dollar continues to depreciate against the same
currency? This depreciation would tend to discourage
foreign investors from buying U.S. securities - particularly U.S.
Treasury bonds. When foreigners think the dollar is weak, they expect to
be compensated with higher interest rates. When higher rates have to be
paid and the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing rises, interest rates
rise across the board. This hinders both U.S. economic growth and investment
performance.
<P>

Consumer confidence is a third risk. From 1991 through mid-1994, consumer
confidence rose in an environment of improving job growth and lower
interest rates. 
<P>

Spending by consumers represents approximately two-thirds of total
spending in the economy - so you can see that consumer confidence is
important. But when interest rates are rising and job growth is slowing,
there is a risk that consumer confidence will falter. A decline in
consumer confidence, then, has the result of slowing growth further.
<P>

Over the next year, these three risks - inflation, the dollar and
consumer confidence - do not appear sufficiently high to threaten
continued economic growth. Consider them benign boogiemen. 
<P>

But the threat they represent can change over time and, of course,
non-economic risks (such as politics and war) can make them even
scarier. Because the risk profile of the economy for 1996 remains low
and the probability of continued economic growth high, we think that now
is a good time for you to get your sleep.
