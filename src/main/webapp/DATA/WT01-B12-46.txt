 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> REPAIRING THE SKIN </H2>

<P>The ingredients in the FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX take advantage of the circadian rhythm characteristics of the body. Nighttime is reserved for repair of body tissues and the rebuilding of damaged systems, plus conserving and replenishing energy stores.  Cell division and growth occur at a much greater rate at night than during the day. This serves two purposes. The energy required for cell division need not be diverted for other causes, and the exposure to ultraviolet rays is less at night than during the day, which protects the vulnerable mitotic cell from radiation injury.</P>
<P>  The skin needs more nutrients to supply the raw materials for repair. These nutrients include amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fuel to make it all happen. During the skin's repair process, the increased metabolic rate in some cells generates more free radicals through oxidative phosphorylation.  Antioxidants are needed to keep cellular damage in check; therefore, adequate antioxidants must be available both internally and topically as well. Vitamin C and Vitamin E are not well supplied to the skin by the body, so supplements are very worthwhile for the skin. As a matter of fact, the overall  nutritional  status of an  individual can be evaluated by looking at the skin.   The use of Proanthocyanidins   and   glutathione   provide   a cytoplasmic and extracellular source of super potent antioxidants that work with and support activity of other antioxidants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN A</H2>
<P>  High levels of Vitamin A in FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX provide retinol, which is ultimately converted to retinoic acid. It, then, acts as an inducer and controller of cell proliferation and creates a delicate balance of maintenance and new growth for repair of the skin. The beta glucans contained in   FOREVER  YOUNG   Marine  Concentrate  act primarily as a Langerhans cell stimulator which initiates a cascade of events that activates helper T-cells. This, in turn, activates macrophages that send out specific interleukens to turn on fibroblasts, enthothelial cells and kerationcytes.  This action results in a comprehensive physiological repair process that is an essential part of the biological surveillance and maintenance system of the body. New blood vessels and new connective tissues are laid down along with a renewal of epidermal cells. This stimulation of the Langerhans cells is a daily process, for they are the sentinel cells of the skin. In sun damaged skin they are markedly reduced so that the effectiveness of beta glucan is also reduced. This is a major reason that it is best to avoid extensive exposure to the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ELASTIN FORMATION </H2>
<P>The FOREVER YOUNG Marine Concentrate contained in the DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX stimulates the formation of elastin by an unknown mechanism. It stimulates epidermal growth and repair and balances skin tones for a smooth, even complexion.   These physiological responses are most likely immune in nature, and function through second messenger relays. Most of the reactions we see with the FOREVER YOUNG Marine Concentrate are immune reactions representing a complex series of steps that are largely unknown at this time, but are mainly mediated through helper T-cells and macrophages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE THE DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</H2>
<P>  After using <A HREF="mfyem.htm"> FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A> and applying  <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>, you are ready to apply the DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX.  It is a very highly concentrated cream and can produce fantastic results if used on a consistent basis. Apply lightly and easily over the entire face.  Do not get it in the eyes.  The day application is important to provide protection from the free radical action from exposure to the environment. The nighttime application enhances the body's ability to repair the facial skin while this process is most active. Gently massage FOREVER YOUNG DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX to the neck area as far back as the ears.   It will penetrate into the skin leaving no unpleasant residue. You will love its soft, pleasant feel and appreciate its non-greasy clean, smooth feeling.</P>
