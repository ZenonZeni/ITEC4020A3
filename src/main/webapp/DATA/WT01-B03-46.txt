<p><img src="/gifs/why.gif" width=59 height=28 alt=WHY?> NOAA's <b>climate-change and weather-prediction models</b> require measurements of wind speed and direction, as well as heat and moisture fluxes, over the global ocean surface. Since the required number of in-situ instruments would be impossibly expensive to deploy and maintain, <b>remote sensors</b> that could do the job from <b>satellites</b> are being developed. Prototype passive (<b>radiometric</b>) and active (<b>radar</b>) ocean sensors have already been placed in orbit by several nations. However, preliminary results from these instruments reveal <b>gaps in our understanding</b>, both of the detailed structure and dynamics of the ocean surface itself, and the physics of how electromagnetic waves interact with it. </p>

<p>Because the desired sea-surface properties cannot be measured directly by <b>radars</b>, and because the scattering of radar signals is determined almost entirely by sea-surface roughness, the first problem is to find out what statistical properties of sea-surface roughness are most closely related to wind and fluxes. This problem lies in the realm of hydrodynamics, and is under study in another related ETL project. The second problem is to <b>find out how these statistical properties of the sea surface can be extracted from backscattered radar echoes</b>.  Before this <b>inverse problem</b> can be solved, however, the <b>direct problem</b> (what is the scattering from a sea-like surface?) must first be well in hand.</p><hr>

<h3>What is the Direct Scattering Problem?</h3>
<img src="gifs/scat.jpg" border=2 align=right hspace=10 width=300 height=178>The main reason this problem has not yet been satisfactorily solved is the very <b>complex nature of the sea-surface roughness</b>. The short, centimeter-scale waves that are responsible for backscattering microwave radar signals are superimposed on a continuum of longer waves, ranging in scale from tens of centimeters to hundreds of meters, which travel in various directions. Even numerical solutions of this statistical problem in three dimensions are beyond the abilities of today's computers. 

<p>To <b>simplify</b> the problem, "two-scale" or composite-surface models have been tried. This approach combines two "classical" methods of wave-propagation theory:  the method of small perturbations and the semi-classical approximation. However, in addition to lacking the necessary accuracy for quantitative predictions, this method uses a somewhat arbitrary scale-dividing parameter that makes the solution of the inverse problem ambiguous. Many important characteristics of scattering, such as polarization, angle, and dependence of cross sections on wind speed, cannot be accounted for over realistic ranges of parameter values. <b>A more accurate theory is required</b> that is free of fitting parameters.<p>

For a long time, no solutions to this problem were known. During the last decade, a number of new <b>"unified" theories</b> were advanced, in particular by D. Winebrenner and A. Ishimaru (the "phase perturbation approach"), M. Milder ("operator expansion"), E. Bahar ("full-wave approach"), and A. Fung and K. Chen ("integral equation model"). Numerical simulations have shown that these approaches  <b>extend the utility of "classical" methods</b> significantly. However, validity regimes of these approaches are not always clear, and their applicability to real sea roughness is not well established.<p> <hr>

<h3>What have we done?</h3>
The method developed at ETL uses surface slope as a small parameter. (Sea roughness slopes usually do not exceed 0.1-0.2.) A. Voronovich uses the "<a href="http://www1.etl.noaa.gov/pubs.htm#oceas">small-slope approximation</a>," and V. Tatarskii uses the "<a href="http://www.etl.noaa.gov/et0pubs.htm">quasi-slope expansion</a>." The small-slope approximation was recently generalized to incorporate the case of multiple reflections ("non-local small-slope approximation"). The quasi-slope expansion was developed by V. Tatarskii and M. Charnotskii in "tilt-invariant" form, which is not restricted to small slopes and is associated instead with small roughness curvatures. <p> <hr>

<h3>Present research areas</h3>
These methods now have to be applied to <b>realistic models of the sea surface</b>, i.e., ones that are expressed in terms of a wave directional spectrum.  The problem here is that the "unified" models require subtle statistical characteristics of the sea waves that are not easily calculated for non-Gaussian height distributions. Now, a statistical model of sea surface roughness is being developed by V. I. Tatarskii and V. V. Tatarskii, which will permit calculation of the required statistical functions from empirical information about sea-wave spectra. This model is being tested in numerical simulations.<p>

We are also working on the problem of scattering at small grazing angles of incidence, which is important practically but difficult to treat theoretically. Present models disagree greatly with observations, possibly because <b>diffraction by long ocean waves</b> is being ignored. Preliminary calculations suggest that such effects may be important for grazing angles less than about 20 deg.<p><hr>
