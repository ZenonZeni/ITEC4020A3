<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Mainstream medicine ignores the lymph system, but its activity is crucial 
        to the health of the immune system and for recovery from illness. When 
        Dr. Marika von Viczay gets the lymph moving, breast cancer, back pain, 
        prostatitis, fibromyalgia, and hormonal imbalances start to clear up.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Aging is  a slow poisoning, a lifetime accumulation of toxins
in the body, states Marika von Viczay, N.D., Ph.D., medical director of the
Isis Health and Rejuvenation Center in Asheville, North Carolina. A primary
reason for this toxic buildup is a lymphatic system that does not do its
proper work of drainage, Dr. von Viczay says. She spent 12 years
researching the most effective way to restore lymph circulation before she
was ready to announce, in 1990, that  Electro-Lymph-atic Therapy&reg; (her
creation) and the use of Lymphtech (a unique device she invented), is the
answer.

<P>Not only is lymphatic drainage a key to disease prevention and
rejuvenation, Dr. von Viczay says it is the means to reverse and contribute
to the natural healing processes of the human system for a host of
illnesses, including breast cancer, breast congestion, prostatitis,
fibromylagia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and lupus.
&quot;You will always see a lymph system that is sluggish in its circulation in
these conditions,&quot; Dr. von Viczay says. People do not die so much from
cancer as from an excess of toxins and sludge-like lymph. Lack of exercise
and aging contribute to this clogging of the lymph nodes with toxins and
proteins, says Dr. von Viczay.  
<P>When the lymph fails to function properly,
it becomes stagnant. The clear lymph fluid becomes cloudy and thick,
changing from a condition like water to milk to yogurt then cottage cheese.
Thickened, stagnant lymph overloaded with toxic wastes is the ideal
condition for the onset of numerous illnesses, including cancer. &quot;When the
collecting terminals become blocked, it's like a bottleneck: lymph starts
backing up in the system creating a toxic, oxygen-deprived environment
conducive to degeneration. It can develop into a tumorous condition.&quot; Toxic
lymph can be stored for a long time in the system, just the way the
intestines &quot;store&quot; fecal matter, often for years. This is not a healthy
condition. &quot;I have not seen a person who could not benefit from lymph
therapy.&quot; Moving the stagnant lymph flow is a key to rejuvenation.  
<P>The
equipment used for Electro-Lymphatic Therapy resembles a flashlight with a
long, extensible housing. Noble gases such as argon and neon are stimulated
by an electrical current to emit a diffuse orange light through the
treatment  &quot;flashlight&quot; head. Dr. von Viczay projects the light upon the
skin, first concentrating on opening up the two drainage sites in the upper
chest and neck where lymph dumps into the bloodstream.  
<P>Lymph therapy is a
whole-body approach. After these sites are opened, the natural flow of the
lymph throughout the body is stimulated. The light breaks up the protein
congestion in the lymph, turning it from &quot;cottage cheese&quot; back to &quot;milk;&quot;
then precise hand-delivered massage gets the lymph moving again, draining
into the bloodstream with its toxic wastes. Thus the treatment detoxifies
the tissues by freeing up the lymph circulation.  
<P>&quot;Detoxification in this
way, by reestablishing free lymphatic circulation throughout the body, is a
vital part of any healing process,&quot; Dr. von Viczay explains. Once you clear
up the lymph flow, which is an essential component of the immune system,
you enhance the body's natural healing ability to help clear up nearly any
illness, as these cases show.  
<P>&quot;My entire health has improved dramatically
since receiving the treatment and observing the follow-up therapy,&quot; says a
patient named Alice. She had been a &quot;candidate&quot; for chemotherapy,
radiation, and maybe mastectomy for breast cancer, but after light emission
treatment her mammograms showed no trace of the cancer. Two holes in her
right retina disappeared. Long-standing bowel problems, including
hemorrhoids, diverticulitis, and a post-surgical intestinal swelling, all
disappeared and her bowel movements became regular. After enduring back
pain for 40 years and after having tried numerous treatments, including
surgery, she found herself, finally, symptom-free. In addition, Alice was
able to abandon all allergy and hypertension medicines that she had needed
for years.

<P>Another woman had fibromyalgia, a condition of muscular and
nerve pain throughout the body. After one 60-minute treatment, she was
visibly better (her double chin started to recede) and her pain was greatly
reduced. Typically, patients with fibromyalgia get relief in one treatment.
A nurse came to Dr. von Viczay with a mammogram showing a breast lump. The
day after her first Electro-Lymphatic Therapy treatment, there was no trace
of the lump on a follow-up mammogram.

<P>Dr. von Viczay regularly clears up
basal congested breast (breasts swollen and painful, with fibroid tissues,
worse during menstruation) in only 2-3 treatments. Benign prostatitis may
take 6-10 treatments because a great deal of drainage throughout the body
is required. In nearly every case of breast cancer Dr. von Viczay has
treated, there has been a lymph circulation blockage in the chest and
underarms and an excess of toxic fluid. &quot;If you catch cancer in its early
stages, I believe lymphatic treatment can restore the body's metabolism and
clear up the cancer,&quot; states Dr. von Viczay.  
<P>Even though Dr. von Viczay
focuses on freeing up lymph circulation, her approach involves the entire
body. She assesses the patient's overall condition with a preliminary blood
test. Then she gets them on a nutrient supplementation program and Chinese
herbal medicines to strengthen the immune system, liver, and kidneys,
central to the detoxification process. She also advises them to bounce on a
trampoline for 10-15 minutes a day to stimulate lymph movement.  
<P>There are
many interlinked conditions that contribute to sluggish lymph circulation
and are improved by lymphatic treatment. These include hormonal imbalances;
chronic constipation and intestinal blockages; muscle and tissue tension
and structural misalignment in the neck and shoulders; and mental confusion
and emotional disorder. Wearing a bra can seriously hinder lymph drainage
through the chest, adds Dr. von Viczay.  
<P>The lymph system is the beginning
and end of all disease, she states. &quot;Once you get the lymph circulating
freely again, this enhances recovery from any illness by reversing the
slow, possibly lifetime, poisoning your body has endured.&quot;

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Your Lymph System at a Glance
<BR><IMG border=1 SRC="images/lymph-illus.gif" ALIGN=bottom WIDTH=334 HEIGHT=383></CENTER></H2>
   The human body has 4 circulatory systems-blood, nerve impulses,  lymph, and
energy (Qi). The lymphatic system includes a vast network of capillaries that
transport the lymph; a series of nodes throughout the body (primarily in the neck,
groin, and armpits) that collect the lymph; and 3 organs, namely, the tonsils,
spleen, and thymus gland, which produce white blood cells (called lymphocytes), vital
to the immune system. 

<P>The space between cells occupies about 18% of the body. Fluid containing plasma
proteins, foreign particles, and bacteria that accumulate in these spaces between
cells, is called lymph. Thus the purpose of the lymphatic system is to collect the
lymph and to return its contents to the bloodstream. More specifically, the lymph
system collects waste products and cellular debris from the tissues. 

<P>The lymph flows slowly upward through the body up to the chest (at the rate of 3
quarts per 24 hours) where it drains into the bloodstream through two large ducts.
Lymph also flows down from the head and neck into this drainage site. Unlike the
heart, the lymphatic system does not have a pump to move it along; rather, its
movement depends on such factors as muscle contraction or manual manipulation. The
lymph circulation is also a one-way circulation: it only returns fluid to the
bloodsteam. The lymph system becomes particularly active during times of illness
(such as the flu), when the nodes (particularly at the throat) visibly swell with
collected waste products.
