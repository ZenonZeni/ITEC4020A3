</H1>
 <P>
<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
The forest products sector has sales of around $8 billion and employs 88,000 
people.
<P>
Output of paper and paper products, including printing, have increased strongly
since mid-1993 reflecting increased demand for paper packaging and containers.
<P>
Production of wood and wood products increased strongly in 1994 due to increased
 demand for timber in residential construction.
<P>
Australia exports $900 million of forest products. Exports of forest products 
have increased on average by 10% over the past three years, including strong 
growth in the export of paper containers.
<P>
R&D spending by the forest products sector in 1992-93 was $55 million.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
Victoria's forest products industry has sales of about $3.2 billion and employs 
23,000 people. Victoria has 26% of the national industry including 34% of paper 
and fibreboard container production, 29% of furniture production and 21% of wood
and wood products output.
<P>
The hardwood timber industry continues to undergo extensive restructuring and 
reinvestment with the number of mills having fallen by 80% over recent years. 
Long-term contracts have facilitated restructuring and a shift toward greater 
value-adding for both import substitution and export.
<P>
Softwood timber production has increased as the softwood plantation resource has
 matured.
<P>
The wood-based panel products sector includes a hardboard factory at Bacchus 
Marsh, particleboard plants at Ballarat and Benalla and a plymill at Myrtleford.
<P>
The pulp and paper industry in Victoria is dominated by Australian Paper, a 
division of Amcor, which has pulp and paper manufacturing plants at Maryvale 
(the largest in Australia), Fairfield and Broadford.
<P>
The pulp and paper industry is subject to intense import competition and 
economies of scale are such that new mills need to export a high proportion of 
output to be viable.  
<P>
Pratt Industries manufactures cardboard boxes at its Coolaroo and Reservoir 
facilities. Bowater manufactures tissue products at its Box Hill plant and 
mechanical pulp at Myrtleford. Australian Newsprint Mills at Albury and 
Kimberley Clark at Millicent in South Australia are significant users of 
Victoria's forest resources.
  <P>
Exports of forest products, consisting mainly of woodchips and pulp, were $180 
million in 1993-94. Pulp and paper exports are mainly destined for New Zealand 
and woodchips are mainly sold to Japan.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</B></I>
<P>
The sawn timber industry remains largely dependent for sales on residential 
construction activity, although opportunities do exist and are being pursued for increased sales in the international market and for import replacement.
<P>
Opportunities for the industry in Victoria include Australian Paper's upgrading 
of its operations as part of Amcor's proposed $1 billion investment in Victoria 
over the next 5-6 years, as well as a number of developments for processing 
associated with the increasing availability of both softwood and hardwood 
resources in
 the State which will focus on overseas market demands for forest products.
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics forecasts that sales of wood and paper products
 will grow at just over 3% through to 2005-6, with most of the growth coming 
from sales of paper.
