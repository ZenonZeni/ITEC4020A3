Ml
</H1>

<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Ml or multilooking has two main functions. 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Square the pixels. ASF SLC (Single Look Complex) images have a resolution of 
approximately of 20m by 4 meters. The most noticeable effect of this pixel 
resolution is the stretching of the image as seen in the example of the program 
<a href="igram.html">igram</a>. Multilooking will <I>square</I> the pixels to 
create a pixel resolution about 20 meters by 20 meters.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Perform a minor filter of the interferogram. As ml steps through the image 
squaring the pixels, ml averages the pixels in its step area which is by default 
1 column by 5 rows. We can increase the area from which ml averages its pixels 
by increasing the look line and look sample attributes. Increasing the look area 
does not change how ml steps through the image nor does it change the output 
image size. However, it does change the pixel resolution. (<I>Note: When 
processing, if you change the look area, make sure the dimensions are maintain 
the same ratio. by default the look area is 1 column by 5 rows. If you want to 
double the look area, you should increase the look area to 2 columns and 10 rows 
and not 10 columns and 2 rows.</I>)</LI>

<DT><H2>Description</H2></DT>
<DD>
We pass asc12.amp as our amplitude file and asc12d.phase as our phase file. Ml 
transforms the float-valued amplitude file into the byte range 0 - 255. In order 
to do this, ml calculates the average value of the amplitude file and converts 
this value to 128. Ml then creates a ratio where
<P><PRE>
                   pixel value             byte value
                   -----------      =      ----------
                     average                  128
</PRE><P>
<I>Pixel value</I> is the value of the current pixel and <I>byte value</I> is 
the corresponding value between 0 and 255.
<P>
This amplitude determines brightness whereas the phase determines color. <img 
src="wheel.gif" width=128 height=128 alt="[Color Wheel]" Align=right></img>The 
phase which has a value between 0 and 2 pi is divided into 6 colors. 0 radians 
starts on the right hand side and increases counter clockwise. See image to 
right.
<P>
In this example we have increased the number of look lines from 5 to 10 and the 
number of look samples from 1 to 2. From previous experience I know that the 
CCSD data is a tad noisy and I want to perform a filter in order to increase 
coherence. This will also decrease the number of singularities and increase 
integration when I perform unwrapping with <a href="escher.html">escher</a>.
<P>
I could have also increased the number of step lines and samples to 10 and 2 
respectively. However, I wanted to keep my pixel spacing at 20 meters by 20 
meters. Do not confuse pixel spacing and resolution. Resolution determines how 
far apart 2 objects on the ground have to be in order for the satellite to 
distinguish them as 2 discrete objects. Pixel spacing refers to the amount of 
ground each pixel covers. Whenever you filter an image, you decrease your 
resolution. However, filtering does not always destroy your pixel spacing. Also, 
pixel spacing cannot be greater than your resolution.
<P>
The two images above are the outputs from ml. If you are using the test data set 
and following the same naming convention, you will find them as ml12.img and 
ml12.amp. Ml also creates two more files ml12.ddr and ml12.phase. Ml12.phase is 
your phase file which you will need for unwrapping, and ml12.ddr is a data 
display record used with the <b>Xid</b> imaging program. The greyscale image was 
converted into a byte file, then into a PGM file using <b>rawtopgm</b>, and 
finally displayed with <b>xv</b>. While brightness and contrast may differ, you 
should get the same general image regardless of which imaging tool you use.
<P>
The colorized interferogram shows a lot of banding across the image. (<I>The 
resampled version here may be hard to see. Either download the full size gif 
version or look at your own image if you are using the test data set.</I>) These 
bands are the result of incorrect baseline parameters. We will need to refine 
our baseline parameters using a program called <a 
href="refine.html">refine_base</a>. (To view a correctly deramped interferogram, 
see the page <a href="iter.html">Iterations</a>. However, if you are new to 
interferometry, I would suggest you not skip ahead.) Once we correct our 
baseline and deramp again, our interferogram should show us some "pretty" phase 
bands. 
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
The next step in interferometry processing is <a href="escher.html">escher</a>. 
Escher will unwrap your phase file, ml12.phase, and get us ready for refining 
our baseline parameters. Escher is also run if you wish to determine an 
elevation from our interferogram. DEM generation from interferograms require the 
use of an unwrapped phase file.
