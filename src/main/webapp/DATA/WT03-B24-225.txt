Desmos Inc. is focusing on tissue engineering and cell therapy, concentrating on internal applications of tissue adhesion.<P>

In tissue engineering, the company is looking at the way epithelial cells are organized, attach to the skin, and differentiate. In cell therapy, Desmos is working on pancreatic islet cell transplantation and in vivo use of implanted cells. The company also is working on periodontal uses of cells.<P>

Desmos was founded to commercialize discoveries in epithelial cell growth and attachment by Vito Quaranta of the Scripps Research Institute and Jonathan Jones of the Northwestern University Medical School.<P>

Although epithelial cells account for more than 90 percent of the body's cell types, many kinds are difficult to culture and grow. Desmos' founding scientists have discovered a novel laminin, a class of proteins found in the extracellular matrix. The protein, Desmosin, plays a role in helping epithelial cells attach to the extracellular matrix, signal other cells and organize into body tissues.<P>

<CENTER><B>How it works</CENTER></B><P>

Desmosin is found in the basement membrane of epithelial tissues and, with another protein, a cell adhesion receptor called integrin alpha6-beta4, anchors the epithelial cells to the matrix. In addition, alpha6-beta4 may signal cells to stop growing, or to spread, or to refrain from migrating. <P>

This receptor and desmosin work together like two halves of a zipper to hold epithelial cells to their framework, resulting in the formation of attachment sites called hemidesmosomes. Company scientists discovered that certain epithelial cells cultured on Desmosin matrices spontaneously develop hemidesmosomes.<P>

The company is developing a Desmosin matrix, similar to that found in the body, for growing epithelial cells to be used in medical applications involving a wide variety of epithelial cells. According to Desmos, because the matrix provides an attractive environment for cells, it can be used to grow such cells in greater numbers than ever before from a small number of donor cells, and also to coat synthetic implants or prostheses for increased biocompatibility.<P>

Initially, Desmos will use Desmosin to treat periodontal disease: Desmosin will be employed to reattach gum epithelia to teeth, and to titanium dental implants. <P>

The second planned application is the treatment of Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes by expanding healthy porcine pancreatic islet cells and subsequently implanting them into patients -- eliminating the need for insulin injections.<P>

The two initial applications were chosen because of market potential, said Charlotte Clark, vice president of business development. According to Clark, more than half of all Americans over 45 have periodontal disease, and about 500,000 receive implants each year. Of these, 5-10 percent of patients experience poor tissue attachment, and there are no known protocols for managing this problem.<P>

<CENTER><B>Insulin program</CENTER></B><P>

Clark estimated that 2.5 million Americans use insulin, including Type I and some Type II diabetics. Some 500,000 of these individuals could benefit from pancreatic islet cell transplantation, but transplant rejection and donor scarcity have limited the efficacy of such an approach.<P>

Both programs are in the research/early preclinical phase. In the periodontal program, titanium implants coated with Desmosin connected to the bone and gum after 30 minutes, said Director of Research Scott Glaser. Desmos is aiming to file its first IND, for use of Desmosin with dental implants, in late 1996 or early 1997. <P>

A second indication would be to treat gums and teeth affected by periodontal disease with Desmosin to promote reformation of the gum epithelia around the treated teeth.<P>

In its pig islet transplantation program, Desmos has succeeded in growing adult pig cells in the Desmosin medium, and is talking to potential corporate partners about delivery systems for the cells.<P>

Eventually, Desmos hopes to develop human islet cells for transplantation. On average, 500,000-800,000 islet cell clusters would be needed, with an average of 2,000 cells per cluster, Glaser said. IND timing for the diabetes program will depend on the choice of delivery system and the corporate partner.<P>

"We believe our technology is also transferable to neurons, hepatocytes, cartilage, and other cell types," Clark said. <P>

<CENTER><B>Extending the technology</CENTER></B><P>

Over the long term, Desmos will explore additional technology applications, including liver tissue engineering for transplantation, and the use of Desmosin to coat a range of implantable devices to improve biocompatibility and reduce formation of blood clots or fibrotic tissue at the implantation site. These programs will most likely be developed through corporate partnerships or licensing agreements, Clark said.<P>

Desmos plans to license its Desmosin matrix to companies and researchers for use in other applications requiring epithelial cells. It currently is supplying seven academic institutions with Desmosin for research purposes only, including the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Helsinki, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.<P>

Desmos received seed financing of $1.5 million from Sanderling and Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. in 1994. It is raising a second venture round from the original funders and new sources, and hopes to raise about $5 million.<P>
