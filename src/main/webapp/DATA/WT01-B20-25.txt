<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Arrests For 1994 Near Half Million
Mark</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 19, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
An estimated 481,098 total arrests were made by state and local
law enforcement during the year 1994, according to the the latest
edition of the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.&nbsp; This figure
pushes the total number of marijuana arrests under the Clinton administration
to a staggering 861,788. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of the 481,098 arrests made for marijuana in 1994, approximately
83.7 percent (402,717) were for simple
&quot;possession.&quot;&nbsp; The remaining 16.3 percent (78,381
arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot; a category that
includes all cultivation offenses -- even those intended for personal
use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This data affirms that the federal govemment's war on
marijuana consumers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime,&quot; says NORML'S Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Not surprisingly, those individuals who possess
marijuana for personal use are being the hardest hit.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">USA Today noted that total drug possession arrests reached a
record 1 million in 1994.&nbsp; This figure is nearly a 43
percent increase from just three years earlier when the number of
Americans arrested for possession of controlled substances stood
at less than 700,000.&nbsp; The FBI report further reveals that
the number of individuals arrested for marijuana possession in
1994 virtually equaled the combined total number of individuals
arrested for possessing heroin, cocaine, and/or their
derivatives. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre or Paul Armentano
of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> @ (202) 483-5500.&nbsp; To receive
a copy of the FBI's 1995 Uniform Crime Report, please call (202)

<p align="center"><b>New York State Senator And NORML Board
Member Joseph L. Galiber Dies</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">State Senator Joseph L. Galiber, a Bronx New York
Democrat who took unpopular stands on crime and drug policy and
remained a power in New York City and state politics for three decades,
died recently of a heart attack. He was 71. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. Galiber was first elected to the state senate in 1968.&nbsp;
He was an early supporter of methadone-maintenance programs and
an early and vocal opponent of mandatory sentencing laws.&nbsp;
He favored the legalization of marijuana and joined the <b>NORML</b>
board of directors in September of 1994.&nbsp; His essay,
&quot;Marijuana Prohibition: A Mistaken View Of Reality,&quot;
recently appeared in the June issue of <b>NORML</b>'s monthly
publication, Ongoing Briefing. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harvard professor and fellow NORML board member Lester Grinspoon, M.D.,
said: &quot;Sen. Galiber will be sorely missed by all who work in
drug reform.&nbsp; He was a wise and compassionate man and one of
the few elected public officials courageous enough to speak out
against the 'war on drugs.'&nbsp; His valuable counsel will be
sorely missed at <b>NORML</b>.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Exaggerated Claim Of Pot's Potency Reaches
Most Absurd Level Yet<br>
Illinois Lieutenant Governor Purports Today's Marijuana To Be<br>
One Thousand Percent More Potent</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 19, 1995, Illinois:</b>&nbsp; In a
press release condemning the release of HEMPILATION: Freedom Is
NORML -- a benefit CD for the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws -- Illinois Lieutenant Governor Bob
Kustra claims that, &quot;According to research conducted by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the marijuana sold
on the streets today is 1,000 percent more potent ... than what
many parents experimented with in the l960s and 1970s.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Contrary to Kustra's allegations, annual marijuana potency
figures supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse indicate
that marijuana today is essentially no stronger than in the
past.&nbsp; NIDA data taken from a 1994 report monitoring yearly
cannabis potency demonstrates that ordinary marijuana has contained
approximately 3 to 4 percent THC for at least the last 13
years.&nbsp; NIDA only began measuring marijuana potency in the
mid-l970s. <br>

<p align="center"><b>International Medical Journal Publishes
Editorial<br>
Calling For The Decriminalization Of Cannabis</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 11, 1995, Great Britian:</b>&nbsp;
The prestigious British medical journal, <i>The Lancet</i>, printed
an <a href="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/lancet.html">editorial</a>
in its November 11 issue calling for the decriminalization and
regulation of cannabis similar to the Dutch model.&nbsp; The
November <a
href="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/lancet.html">editorial</a>
-- entitled &quot;Deglamorising cannabis&quot; -- asks the question:
&quot;Where is the harm in decriminalizing cannabis?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After weighing the evidence, the <a
href="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/lancet.html">editorial</a>
concludes that: &quot;The smoking of cannabis, even long term, is
not harmfal to health.&nbsp; ...[Yet] cannabis has become
political football, and one that governments continually
duck.&nbsp; Like footballs, however, it bounces back.&nbsp;
Sooner or later politicians will have to stop running scared and
address the evidence: cannabis per se is not a hazard to society
but driving it further underground may well be.&quot; <br>
