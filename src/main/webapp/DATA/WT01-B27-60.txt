<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marijuana</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and School Children </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most serious accusations leveled against marihuana
by special feature writers has been that it is widely used by the
school children of this nation. These authors have claimed that
it has so detrimental an effect on development that it is a major
factor in juvenile delinquency. This phase of the marihuana
problem was deemed serious enough to merit primary consideration
in our study of the marihuana problem in New York City --
specifically in the Borough of Manhattan. We decided to attack
this aspect of the problem along the following lines: </p>

<ol>
    <li>To observe schools in order to see if pupils bought
        marihuana cigarettes from any peddlers operating in the
        neighborhood. </li>
    <li>To investigate thoroughly complaints made by parents to
        school and police authorities relative to marihuana and
        its use by school children. </li>
    <li>To interview principals, assistant principals, and
        teachers of many of the schools in New York City with
        reference to our project. </li>
    <li>To gather relevant statistics from various city bureaus
        and private agencies. </li>
</ol>

<p>Unknown to the school authorities, our investigators had under
surveillance many of the schools in the Borough of Manhattan.
They would observe a particular school for a number of
consecutive days, watch loiterers and suspicious characters in
the locality, and, under certain circumstances, follow some of
the children. This procedure was repeated at varying intervals in
different localities. From time to time the investigators would
return to some of the schools which they previously had kept
under surveillance. Attention was naturally concentrated upon
those schools from which emanated the most numerous complaints
and which were located in suspected neighborhoods. We must admit
that it would have been possible for such sales to have taken
place during the time that our investigators were not on duty,
but we came to the conclusion that there was no organized traffic
on the part of peddlers in selling marihuana cigarettes to the
children of the schools we observed. </p>

<p>Certain of the school authorities deserve special commendation
for their alertness in singling out suspicious characters
loitering in the vicinity of their schools. While investigating
one of the suspected schools, our investigators who were
loitering in the neighborhood were suspected and treated as
&quot;suspicious characters&quot; by the school authorities. </p>

<p>During the period of this survey the Police Department while
engaged in an entirely separate criminal investigation received a
lead indicating the sale of marihuana to children in a certain
high school. As a result, one pupil was arrested and convicted
for selling cigarettes to his classmates. </p>

<p>In the Harlem district we discovered a few places where school
children gathered during and after school hours for the purpose
of indulging in smoking ordinary cigarettes, drinking alcoholic
beverages, and engaging in homosexual and heterosexual
activities. </p>

<p>One of our investigators, having gained entrance to such a
place, ostentatiously displayed marihuana cigarettes which he had
with him. The madam of the place promptly cautioned him against
using the &quot;weed&quot; and insisted that at no time did she
permit any person to smoke it on her premises. </p>

<p>A surprising number of school children smoking ordinary
cigarettes were noted. A checkup revealed that these cigarettes
were being illicitly sold by men on the street and in candy
stores in the &quot;loose&quot; form. It is possible that this
trade in ordinary cigarettes is occasionally misinterpreted as
trade in &quot;reefers.&quot; </p>

<p>Interviews with school authorities were very significant, and
it is of value to summarize briefly some of the statements
actually made by them. The locations of the schools and the names
of the persons quoted are in our official files. </p>

<ol>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;The school has never had any connection with
        marihuana, not even a rumor.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal at first
        appeared to be evasive and did not readily volunteer
        information, but after repeatedly being pressed with the
        question stated that the school &quot;had not had any
        difficulty with the subject of marihuana.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal
        emphatically stated, &quot;I have had no trouble with
        marihuana in my school.&quot; </li>
    <li>A vocational school in the Borough of Queens. Mixed.
        &quot;I have never heard the slightest thing about
        marihuana in connection with this school.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Queens. Mixed. &quot;We never had the
        slightest connection with marihuana in any way.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Harlem. Predominantly Negro and
        Latin-American. The principal stated that there had been
        a few marihuana cases among the boys about eighteen
        months ago. His assistant volunteered the information
        that there had been some boys in the school who had
        &quot;reefers&quot; in their possession. On other
        occasions some of the boys appeared to be intoxicated and
        when examined confessed to having smoked
        &quot;reefers.&quot; He further stated, &quot;It was
        difficult to be sure if sleepy, perspiring,
        pallid-looking boys were feeling the effects of marihuana
        or were just recovering from too much 'partying' or
        drinking.&quot; He volunteered the opinion that since
        marihuana was an acute problem among the adult population
        in that particular district, it could be assumed that
        marihuana could occasionally become a problem in the
        school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Latin-American. On the
        fringe of Harlem. Principal and assistant principal
        stated that they have never had the slightest difficulty
        arising from marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Negro. Bordering on Harlem.
        The principal, because of his short tenure of office, was
        unable to express his opinion on the subject. The chief
        clerk stated that marihuana had never been a problem in
        the school. She was certain, however, that it was sold in
        the neighborhood. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White, with a high percentage of
        Negro and Latin-American. The principal stated, &quot;As
        yet we have had no contact with marihuana although,
        considering the neighborhood, it would not be
        unlikely.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American, Negro, and some
        white. The principal stated, &quot;We have had no trouble
        with marihuana.&quot; He was of the opinion that because
        of the locality it would be possible for some older boys
        to smoke it without anybody being cognizant of it. He
        added that he would let us know if any boys were detected
        smoking. During the period of the survey no such report
        was made. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American predominating. The
        principal stated that she had not had any trouble with
        marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White predominating. The principal
        stated, &quot;I have had no contact with it.&quot;
        However, due to the location of the school, which was
        near Harlem, she stated she would notify the Juvenile Aid
        Bureau if such a problem arose. During the period of the
        survey no such report was received. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that no
        information concerning the use of any narcotics had ever
        come to his attention and was equally insistent that
        teachers would have reported any such information to him.
    </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that she
        had never found anything to indicate the use of any drug
        in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and mixed. The principal stated
        that last year he had suspected that a group of chronic
        truants were using marihuana but he was unable to obtain
        any direct evidence. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal and his
        assistant stated that they had no real evidence of any
        marihuana problem in the school, and they do not believe
        that the drug is used to any extent. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        although she had no tangible evidence of marihuana
        smoking among the students, she has problem groups that
        gather in premises where she is inclined to think that
        marihuana could be obtained if they wished to get it. She
        is certain no marihuana is used in the school itself. We
        investigated thoroughly the suggestions made by the
        principal as to premises where marihuana might be sold
        but we were unable to gather any evidence of its sale. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The acting principal and a
        teacher in the school who had been there for a number of
        years stated that there had never been any evidence of
        the use of marihuana or any other drugs in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The health director of this
        school stated that any evidence concerning the use of
        narcotics by pupils would have been called to his
        attention, but none had been. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had been no traces of marihuana smoking. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had never been the slightest suggestion of
        marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The assistant principal stated
        that he knew of no marihuana problem in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        because of the publicity given to marihuana smoking she
        had been on the alert to discover indications of its use
        in her school but had found no evidence of marihuana in
        the school or of anything that would lead her to believe
        that any one of her students used marihuana outside of
        the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        nothing pertaining to the use of narcotics had been
        reported to him in all the years he had been there. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. Authorities, including
        the medical department, stated that no student had ever
        been reported for being under the influence of marihuana.
    </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;There is no indication of a marihuana problem in
        the school.&quot; </li>
    <li>Grammar School. The principal stated that anonymous
        letters had been received from time to time from pupils
        in the school in reference to marihuana. One letter was
        actually signed by a pupil of the school, who reported
        the sale of marihuana in a candy store in the vicinity.
        The principal with held the name of the pupil but
        requested us to investigate the report. We kept this
        school, the immediate neighborhood, and all candy stores
        in the vicinity under strict surveillance, but were
        unable to gather any evidence which would indicate that
        the pupils of this school were obtaining marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Queens. The assistant
        principal stated that he had never heard anything about
        marihuana being a problem in his school. We had received
        a complaint about this school and one of our
        investigators had an informal chat with one of the
        teachers of this school who, because of her interest in
        the school children, appeared to be more conversant than
        anyone else with general problems at the school. She
        stated that she was certain marihuana was used by some of
        the students. She elaborated on the subject and recalled
        that a few months prior to the interview she had sent
        home five students (three Negroes and two Italians) whom
        she had noticed acting &quot;dopey&quot; in the classroom
        after the noon recess. She was not positive they were
        under the influence of marihuana but was fairly certain
        that they were under the influence of some drug. A
        student had told her that these boys used
        &quot;reefers&quot; and, noticing their stupor, she had
        concluded that they were under the influence of
        marihuana. Superficial examination showed her that their
        condition was not due to drinking whisky or any alcoholic
        beverage. In this school it was not necessary to notify
        the principal if a student was sent home. The teacher did
        so on her own account, arriving at a diagnosis without
        informing the principal of the condition. There was no
        doctor or nurse to examine the students. </li>
    <li>Grammar School. Negro. The principal and the social
        worker attached to this school stated that some time
        prior to the interview they had heard that cigarettes
        were being sold to children in Harlem. We were told of a
        certain man who was suspected of selling them to the
        children. The social worker was certain that a year
        before the interview marihuana cigarettes were sold on a
        certain street in Harlem to school children, but she had
        no knowledge as to whether the condition existed at the
        time of our investigation. While working on another part
        of the survey, we interviewed a young Negress,
        approximately 20 years of age, who was a marihuana
        smoker. She stated that she and another girl started to
        smoke marihuana cigarettes while attending this
        particular school. </li>
    <li>High School. Mixed, predominantly white. The principal
        stated that he was positive that there was no marihuana
        problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. A student was arrested
        for selling marihuana cigarettes to other pupils. We kept
        this school under surveillance after the arrest. Although
        we heard rumors that the sale of marihuana would start
        again, we were unable to gather any evidence of this. Our
        investigators attended the dance of the graduating class
        of this school at one of the hotels in the city. The
        dance was well conducted and had a large attendance.
        There was no evidence of smoking at this affair. The
        principal was cooperating with the Juvenile Aid Bureau of
        the Police Department in conducting the investigation of
        the marihuana problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. White and Negro. Although rumor is
        widespread that &quot;reefer&quot; smoking is common at
        this school, thorough investigation did not produce
        evidence of it at the time of our investigation. We did
        obtain information, which we consider authoritative, that
        in 1935 a man was offered the concession to sell
        marihuana cigarettes to the students of this school. He
        refused the offer. The principal of this school stated
        that there had never been any trouble as a result of
        marihuana smoking and he knew of no actual cases. </li>
    <li>High School. White, Negro, and Latin-American. The
        director of health education, who was conversant with the
        subject, stated that the school had no problem with
        regard to marihuana smoking on the premises but that a
        Puerto Rican student who lived in Harlem had informed him
        that he could obtain marihuana cigarettes in his
        locality. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. We did
        not interview the authorities. Observation of the be
        havior of and conversation with students did not reveal
        any marihuana problem. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. This
        college is located near one of the famous
        &quot;tea-pads&quot; of Harlem. Many of the students pass
        the house regularly. Continued observation did not reveal
        any student attendance. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Most of the boys of this
        school were familiar with the subject of marihuana. The
        pupils of the school are incessant smokers of ordinary
        cigarettes. We were unable to obtain any information
        which would indicate that they used &quot;reefers.&quot;
        Some students were observed entering a house in which
        there was a &quot;tea-pad,&quot; but we never found any
        of the occupants of this &quot;tea-pad&quot; to be pupils
        of the school. The counselor at the school stated that
        during the previous term there were suspicions regarding
        the use of marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. The principal, who is
        considered qualified to discuss this subject, stated that
        for the three months prior to the interview there had
        been no marihuana problem. She ventured the opinion that
        a few cases do arise in the spring and summer.
        Observation of this school reveals that practically every
        day young boys between the ages of 18 and 20 loitered
        near the gates of the schoolyard at the close of the
        session. Some of these boys were known to our
        investigators as &quot;reefer&quot; smokers, and they
        associated with the girls of the school. Two young girls
        known by our investigators to be &quot;reefer&quot;
        smokers stated that they started to smoke marihuana while
        at that school. </li>
    <li>High School. White, many Negroes and Latin-Americans.
        Many students smoked ordinary tobacco cigarettes.
        Numerous complaints and rumors were associated with this
        school. The principal stated that in 1934 they had an
        acute marihuana problem but that at the present time they
        did not think it existed. They are constantly on guard,
        especially at the beginning of a term, because they get
        many new students from the Harlem district. We are of the
        opinion that there are definite signs indicating that
        there is some marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>High School. Negro and white. The principal of this
        school stated that they did not have a marihuana problem.
        We are certain, however, that this school does to some
        extent present an acute problem for we have observed a
        few students smoking &quot;reefers&quot; away from the
        school. We have reason to believe that some of them smoke
        it while at school. The girls attending this high school
        have a very low moral standard. </li>
</ol>

<p>On the basis of the above statements and findings, we feel
justified in concluding that although marihuana smoking may be
indulged in by small numbers of students in certain schools of
New York City, it is apparently not a widespread or largescale
practice. In the belief that actual facts concerning the role
played by marihuana in the production of juvenile delinquency
could best be revealed in the records of the Children's Court of
New York City, we interviewed the proper authorities on this
subject. On the basis of the Children's Court records for 1939,
marihuana is not an important factor in the development of
delinquency. </p>
