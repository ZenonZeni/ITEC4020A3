Partnership for a Drug-Free Iowa <br>

<br>
<br>
Dear Dale, <br>
<br>
Enclosed are letters from <a href="../HELMERS/helmers1.html">
Allen Helmers</a> and his <a href="../HELMERS/verduyn.html">
doctor</a>.&nbsp; The letters are self-explanatory.&nbsp; I'd
appreciate anything you can do to help Allen, particularly by
writing a letter to the Black Hawk County District Court pleading
for mercy.&nbsp; The address is 316 East 5th Street, Waterloo,
Iowa 50703. <br>
<br>
Allen's case number and caption are: Case No. FECR047575, State
of Iowa v. Helmers, Allen Douglass, PIN #483567994. <br>
<br>
I've also enclosed a letter from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy
Examiners explaining the history of Iowa's therapeutic marijuana
research program.&nbsp; Obviously, we'd like to see such a
program re-instated in Iowa.&nbsp;: It appears that the previous
one never got off the ground.&nbsp; We would appreciate any
support you can give us in the upcoming legislative session. <br>
<br>
Finally, I've enclosed a <a href="olsen-01.html"> letter</a> that
I wrote to U.S. Senator Tom Harkin.&nbsp; We would appreciate
your help in asking Senator Harkin to support medical marijuana
legislation in the U.S. Senate and to use his influence on the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee to pressure the National
Institute on Drug Abuse to allow the use of marijuana for medical
research. <br>
<br>
Thank you very much. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
<br>
<br>
