<p> The tide has turned in the war against the War on Drugs. It
is a tough fight, but those who support drug policy reform have
begun to carry the day. There have been three major television
specials on the issue in less than a year and the DEA openly
admitted their arguments were in trouble when they called a
special conference last August to try to find ways to argue
against reform. They have been getting pretty well shellacked in
every single debate over the last few years and the media has
begun to seriously question the wisdom of the drug war. The drug
warriors are in retreat and they know it. </p>

<p> The big question for those who support reform is: Where do we
go from here? Activists from around the world have been
discussing this on the Internet, and here are some of the
answers. </p>

<h2>The Internet </h2>

<p> Rapid communication is critical to this movement. Activists
from around the world have joined together on the Internet to
discuss ideas and provide support for each other in a wide
variety of ways. There are plans for a bigger and better presence
on the Internet where news, research, and ideas will be available
to anyone with a computer, and where people from around the world
can work together. We need more people on the Internet. We also
need someone in every city who is plugged in to the network and
can distribute the news on a timely basis to those who are not
yet on the Internet. </p>

<h2>Unity </h2>

<p> The Internet has also brought unity. The biggest single
thrust of the DEA in their public relations campaign is that we
lack unity. The DEA tells the public that those who support
reform don't even agree among themselves on what they want and,
therefore, they could never build a credible public policy. For
many years it was true. We have a number of organizations and
groups around the country who have always agreed on their
opposition to the drug war but have usually worked alone to
pursue their goals. As a result, we looked like a mob, rather
than a team. </p>

<p> Through the internet, we have held lengthy on-line
&quot;meetings&quot; where many of the leading activists and
organizations have discussed where we agreed and disagreed, and
how we could work together toward the goals we all shared. As the
result of those meetings, we have formulated a basic statement of
our objective and the principles which should be the basis for a
better drug policy. They are: </p>

<h2>Our Objective </h2>

<p> Our objective is to bring drugs within the law. </p>

<h2>Principles for a Solution. </h2>

<p> We believe that a better drug policy should be based on three
basic principles: </p>

<p> 1) Decisions on the medical use of drugs should be the sole
province of the medical profession in consultation with its
patients. </p>

<p> 2) Punishment should not be used to control private drug use.
</p>

<p> 3) We must have a consistent policy for all drugs of
potential abuse. </p>

<p> We ask all interested people and groups around the nation to
join us in a recognition of our common goals and present a united
front to the world. We all agree that we need reform now. The
first step toward reform is to press for open and honest
discussion of the issue. </p>

<h2>Better Public Relations </h2>

<p> When it comes to funding for media, we are clearly outgunned
by the drug warriors. But, over the last few years we have just
as clearly beaten them with a better, more sensible message. We
need a grass roots effort to educate the media at all levels.
Keep track of your local newspaper, television, and radio
stations and make sure that the old hysterical lies and
half-truths of the drug war do not go unchallenged. We have
proven that the media will come our way if they know the facts. </p>

<h2>Recruitment </h2>

<p> We all know people who are not members of the DPF but should
be. Many of them are not members simply because no one has asked
them to join, or they don't know the DPF is there. No one has
told them that their support is important. We should all make a
commitment to recruit at least one new member in the coming
month. It's easy. All you need to do is ask them. When you leave
the house tomorrow morning, carry a membership application and a
stamped envelope addressed to the DPF. I will bet you find a new
ally before noon. </p>

<h2>The Next Step </h2>

<p> We have already demonstrated that when the evidence is
examined the drug warriors don't have a leg to stand on. They
have lost every debate in the last few years because of the
evidence, so the last thing they want now is a public discussion
of the evidence. Their &quot;anti-legalization&quot; resolution
even says so, in so many words. Even the mere discussion of
possible alternatives, they say, will cause a massive increase in
drug addiction. </p>

<p> We want to talk about alternatives. We want to review the
evidence. We want openness, honesty, and objectivity in a public
review of all we know about drug policy. We want to lay the cards
on the table and let the chips fall where they may. The drug
warriors do not. Therein lies the difference between us. </p>

<p> Our mission is to draw the drug warriors into a public
debate. We must ask the media to ask them: &quot;What's wrong
with the truth? Why don't you want to read the evidence? Why
won't you discuss it? If you are right, the evidence will surely
show it.&quot; We have nothing to fear from the truth. <br>
