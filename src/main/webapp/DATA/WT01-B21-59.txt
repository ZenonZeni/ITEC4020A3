<p>[Docket No. 86-22]</p>

<p>Marijuana Scheduling Petition;</p>

<p>Denial of Petition; Remand</p>

<p>AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration</p>

<p>ACTION: Final Rule</p>

<p>SUMMARY: This is the final rule of the Administrator of the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) concluding the plant
material marijuana has no currently accepted medical use and
denying the petition of the National Organization for Reform of
Marijuan a Laws (NORML) to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I
to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.</p>

<p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Office of Congressional and
Public Affairs, </p>

<p>202-307-7363.</p>

<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</p>

<p>Background</p>

<p>On December 21, 1989, the former Administrator of DEA,
following rulemaking on the record, which included a hearing
before an administrative law judge, issued a final order
concluding the plant material marijuana has no currently accepted
medical use, and denying the petition of NORML to reschedule
marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled
Substance Act. 54 FR 53767. On April 26, 1991, the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded
the matter to the Administrator for clarification of DEA&#146;s
interpretation of the term &#147;currently accepted medical use
in treatment in the United States.&#148; Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936.</p>

<p>Following a review of the entire record in this matter, and a
comprehensive re-examination of the relevant statutory standard,
I conclude that marijuana has no currently accepted medical use
and must remain in Schedule I. Further hearings are unneces sary
since the record is extraordinarily complete, all parties had
ample opportunity and wide latitude to present evidence and to
brief all relevant issues, and the narrow question on remand
centers exclusively on this Agency&#146;s legal interpretation o
f a statutorily-created standard.</p>

<p>Summary of the Decision</p>

<p>Does the marijuana plant have any currently accepted medical
use in treatment in the United States, within the meaning of the
Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801, et seg.? Put
simply, is marijuana good medicine for illnesses we all fear,
such as multiple sclerosis (MS), glaucoma and cancer?</p>

<p>The answer might seem obvious based simply on common sense.
Smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases. Americans
take their medicines in pills, solutions, sprays, shots, drops,
creams and sometimes in suppositories, but never by smoking. No
medicine prescribed for us today is smoked.</p>

<p>With a little homework, one can learn that marijuana has been
rejected as medicine by the American Medical Association, the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the American Glaucoma
Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American
Canc er Society. Not one American health association accepts
marijuana as medicine.</p>

<p>For the last century, drug evaluation experts at the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been responsible
for protecting Americans from unsafe and ineffective new
medicines. Relying on the same scientific standards used to judge
all other drugs, FDA experts repeatedly have rejected marijuana
for medical use.</p>

<p>Yet claims persist that marijuana has medical value. Are these
claims true? What are the facts?</p>

<p>Between 1987 and 1988, DEA and NORML, under the guidance of an
administrative law judge, collected all relevant information on
this subject. Stacked together it stands nearly five feet high.
Is there reliable scientific evidence that marijuana is me
dically effective? If it has medical value, do its benefits
outweigh its risks? What do America&#146;s top medical and
scientific experts say? Would they prescribe it for their
patients, their families, their friends?</p>

<p>As the current Administrator of Drug Enforcement, and as a
former United States District Judge, I have made a detailed
review of the evidence in this record to find the answers.</p>

<p>There are significant short-term side effects and long-term
risks linked to smoking marijuana. Marijuana is likely to be more
cancer-causing than tobacco; damages brain cells; causes lung
problems, such as bronchitis and emphysema; may weaken the bod
y&#146;s antibacterial defenses in the lungs; lowers overall
blood pressure, which could adversely affect the supply of blood
to the head; causes sudden drops in blood pressure (orthostatic
hypotension), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), and heart palpitati
ons; suppresses luteinizing hormone secretion in women, which
affects the production of progesterone, an important female
hormone; causes anxiety and panic in some users because of its
mind-altering effects; produces dizziness, trouble with thinking,
trou ble with concentrating, fatigue, and sleepiness; and impairs
motor skills.</p>

<p>As a plant, marijuana can contain bacteria capable of causing
serious infections in humans, such as salmonella enteritidis,
Klebsiella pneumonia, group D streptococcus and pathogenic
aspergillus.</p>

<p>Several of these risks stand out. The immune systems of cancer
patients are weakened by radiation and chemotherapy, leaving them
susceptible to infection. If they experiment with marijuana to
control nausea, they risk weakening their immune systems further
and exposing themselves to the infection-causing bacteria in the
plant. It is estimated, for example, that at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 60 patients die each year from
pathogenic aspergillus infections.</p>

<p>Glaucoma patients face possible blindness caused by very high
fluid pressures within their eyes. If they experiment with
marijuana to lower their eye fluid pressure, it can cause
dramatic drops in their blood pressure and reduce the blood
supply to t heir heads. Glaucoma experts testified this reduces
the blood supply to the optic nerves and could speed up, rather
than slow down, their loss of eyesight.</p>

<p>MS, glaucoma and cancer patients who have undiagnosed heart
problems risk heartpalpitations, very rapid heart beats and
sudden dramatic drops in blood pressure if they experiment with
marijuana. For MS and glaucoma patients who must take medications
for the rest of their lives, experimenting with marijuana poses
the additional risks of lung cancer, emphysema, bladder cancer
and leukemia.</p>

<p>Many risks remain unknown. Marijuana contains over 400
separately identified chemicals. No one knows all the effects of
burning these chemicals together and inhaling the burnt mix. Are
these risks outweighed by medical benefits?</p>

<p>There are scientific studies showing pure THC
(Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol), one of the many chemicals found
in marijuana, has some effect in controlling nausea and vomiting.
Pure THC is pharmaceutically made in a clean capsule form, called
Marinol, and is available for use by the medical community. More
information on Marinol can be found in the &#147;Physicians&#146;
Desk Reference,&#148; available in most libraries.</p>

<p>Since marijuana contains THC, you might think marijuana also
would be effective. However, the effect of taking a drug in
combination with other chemicals is seldom the same as taking
just the pure drug. As already noted, marijuana contains over 400
o ther chemicals, not just THC. There are no reliable scientific
studies that show marijuana to be significantly effective in
controlling nausea and vomiting. People refer to the Sallan study
as proving marijuana&#146;s effectiveness. They are mistaken. The
Sallan study involved pure THC, not marijuana. People refer to
the Chang study to support marijuana&#146;s effectiveness. They
also are mistaken. Doctor Chang tested the combination of pure
THC and marijuana to treat nausea and vomiting. The prel iminary
results he got were probably due to the THC, not the marijuana.
Because he tested the combination, we cannot tell just what
effects can be attributed to marijuana alone. People cite a third
study, done by Doctor Levitt, as proof marijuana is eff ective.
They are mistaken. Doctor Levitt compared marijuana to THC in
controlling nausea and vomiting, and he concluded that THC was
the more effective drug.</p>

<p>A librarian can help locate copies of these studies should you
want to see them for yourself. Sallan, et al., &#147;Antiemetic
Effect of Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannibinol in Patients Receiving
Cancer Chemotherapy,&#148; 293 New England Journal of Medicine
795-797 (1975); Chang, et al., &#147;Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol
as an Antiemetic in Cancer Patients Receiving High-Dose
Methotrexate,&#148; 91 Annals of Internal Medicine 819-824
(1979); Levitt, et al., &#147;Randomized Double Blind Comparison
of Delta -9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Marijuana as
Chemotherapy Antiemetics,&#148; (Meeting Abstract) 3 Proceedings
of the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology 91 (1984).</p>

<p>During the 1970's and 1980's, a number of states set up
research programs to give marijuana to cancer and glaucoma
patients, on the chance it might help. Some people point to these
programs as proof of marijuana&#146;s usefulness. Unfortunately,
all research is not necessarily good scientific research. These
state programs failed to follow responsible scientific methods.
Patients took marijuana together with their regular medicines, so
it is impossible to say whether marijuana helped them. Observa
tions or results were not scientifically measured. Procedures
were so poor that much critical research data were lost or never
recorded. Although these programs were well-intentioned, they are
not scientific proof of anything.</p>

<p>Some people refer to a study by Doctor Thomas Ungerleider as
proof marijuana reduced nausea in bone marrow transplant
patients. Unfortunately, Doctor Ungerleider neglected to follow
responsible scientific methods in his study. Like the state
program s, it proves nothing. Doctor Ungerleider chose not to
publish his study evidently because of its serious weaknesses. He
admitted as much when questioned under oath.</p>

<p>Those who say there are reliable scientific studies showing
marijuana is an effective drug for treating nausea and vomiting
are wrong. No such studies exist.</p>

<p>Our nation&#146;s top cancer experts reject marijuana for
medical use. Doctor David S. Ettinger, a professor of oncology at
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an author of
over 100 scholarly articles on cancer treatment, and a nationall
y respected cancer expert, testified:</p>

<p>There is no indication that marijuana is effective in treating
nausea and vomiting resulting from radiation treatment or other
causes. No legitimate studies have been conducted which make such
conclusions.</p>

<p>Doctor Richard J. Gralla, a professor of medicine at Cornell
University Medical College, an associate attending physician at
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and an expert in
cancer research, testified:</p>

<p>Most experts would say, and our studies support, that the
cannabinoids in general are not very effective against the major
causes of nausea and vomiting.</p>

<p>Doctor Gralla added:</p>

<p>I have found that because of the negative side effects and
problems associated with marijuana..., most medical oncologists
and researchers have little interest in marijuana for the
treatment of nausea and vomiting in their patients.</p>

<p>Doctor John Laszlo, Vice President of Research for the
American Cancer Society, an expert who has spent 37 years
researching cancer treatments, and who has written a leading
textbook on the subject, &#147;Antiemetics and Cancer
Chemotherapy,&#148; tes tified there is not enough scientific
evidence to justify using marijuana to treat nausea and vomiting.
Not one nationally-recognized cancer expert could be found to
testify on marijuana&#146;s behalf.</p>

<p>To be an effective treatment for glaucoma, a drug must: (I)
lower the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure), (ii)
for prolonged periods of time, and (iii) actually preserve sight
(vidual fields). Five scientific studies are cited as evidence
marijuana is an effective glaucoma treatment. Those who cite
these studies are mistaken. These studies tested pure THC, not
marijuana. W.D. Purnell and J.M. Gregg,
&#147;Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, Euphoria and Intraocular
Pressure in Man,&#148; 7 A nnals of Ophthalmology 921-923 (1975);
M. Perez-Reyes, D. Wagner, M.E. Wall, and K.H. Davis,
&#147;Intravenous Administration of Cannabinoids on Intraocular
Pressure,&#148; The Pharmacology of Marijuana 829-832 (M.C.
Braude and S. Szara eds. 1976); J.C. M erritt, S.M. McKinnon,
J.R. Armstrong, G. Hatem, and L.A. Reid, &#147;Oral
Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Hyperogeneous Glaucomas,&#148; 12
Annals of Ophthalmology 947 (1980); K. Green and M. Roth,
&#147;Ocular Effects of Topical Administration of Delta-
9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Man,&#148; 100 Archives of
Ophthalmology 265-267 (1982); and W.M. Jay and K. Green,
&#147;Multiple-Drop Study of Topically Applied 1%
Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Human Eyes,&#148; 101 Archives of
Ophthalmology 591-593 (1983). </p>

<p>Three studies show very heavy doses of marijuana, taken for
short periods of time, can reduce eye pressure. R.S. Hepler, I.M.
Frank, and T.J. Ungerleider, &#147;Pupillary Constriction After
Marijuana Smoking,&#148; 74 American Journal of Ophthalmolog y
1185-1190 (1972); R.S. Hepler, I.M. Frank, and R. Petrus,
&#147;Ocular Effects of Marijuana Smoking,&#148; The Pharmacology
of Marijuana 815-824 (1976); and J.C. Merritt, W.J. Crawford,
P.C. Alexander, A.L. Anduze and S.S. Gelbart, &#147;Effect of
Marij uana on Intraocular and Blood Pressure in Glaucoma,&#148;
87 Ophthalmology 222-228 (1980).</p>

<p>Unusually large doses of marijuana were needed in these three
studies to achieve the desired effect. Heavy marijuana use
produces dizziness, trouble with thinking, impaired motor skills,
fatigue and sleepiness. The 1976 study by Doctors Hepler, Fran k
and Petrus emphasized &#147;Our subjects were sometimes too
sleepy to permit measurement of intraocular pressures...3 hours
after intoxication.&#148; If a glaucoma patient were to smoke
marijuana 8 to 10 times every day for the rest of his life, would
h e be alert and energetic enough to live a relatively normal
life? Would he develop other diseases? No scientific studies
exist to answer these questions. Robert Randall claims to have
saved his sight by smoking 8 to 10 marijuana cigarettes every
day. U nder oath he admits he stays at home most days, follows no
daily schedule or routine, and has not held a regular job in over
15 years. He also has avoided having a comprehensive medical
examination since 1975.</p>

<p>No scientific studies have shown marijuana can reduce eye
pressure over long periods of time.</p>

<p>No scientific studies have shown marijuana can save eyesight.</p>

<p>America&#146;s top glaucoma experts reject marijuana as
medicine. Doctor Keith Green is a professor of Ophthalmology who
serves, or has served, on the editorial boards of eight
prestigious eye journals (Ophthalmic Research, Oftalmo Abstracto,
Current Eye Research, Experimental Eye Research, Investigative
Ophthalmology, American Journal of Ophthalmology, Archives of
Ophthalmology, and Survey of Ophthalmology). Doctor Green has
conducted extensive basic and clinical research using marijuana
and THC to treat glaucoma patients. He has authored over 200
books or research articles in ophthalmology and is a highly
respected expert on this subject. Doctor Green testified:</p>

<p>There is no scientific evidence...that indicates that
marijuana is effective in regulating the progression of symptoms
associated with glaucoma. *** It is clear that there is no
evidence that marijuana use prevents the progression of visual
loss in gla ucoma. *** The quantities of the drug required to
reduce intraocular pressure in glaucoma sufferers are large, and
would require the inhalation of at least six marijuana cigarettes
each day. *** Smoking is not a desirable form of treatment for
many reason s...[M]arijuana...has little potential future as a
glaucoma medication.</p>

<p>Doctor George Spaeth is the Director of the Glaucoma Service
at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, the largest service in the
United States devoted to researching and treating glaucoma and to
teaching other doctors about this disease. Doctor Spaeth is
President of the American Glaucoma Society. He is a professor of
ophthalmology, the editor of a scholarly eye journal (Ophthalmic
Surgery), and the author of over 200 research articles on
glaucoma. He testified:</p>

<p>I have not found any documentary evidence which indicates that
a single patient has had his or her natural history of the
disease altered by smoking marijuana.</p>

<p>Amputees and victims of MS can suffer from extreme muscle
spasms. It is claimed marijuana is useful in treating spasticity.
Three unusually small, inconclusive studies have tried using pure
THC, not marijuana, to treat spasticity. D.J. Petro and C.
Ellenberger, &#147;Treatment of Human Spasticity with
Delta-9-Tetrahydro-cannabinol,&#148; 21 Journal of Clinical
Pharmacology 413S-416S (1981) (included only nine patients). Two
of the studies are mere abstracts, or short digests, without much
detail. Hanigan, Destee &amp; Troung Abstr. B45, Clin. Pharmacol.
Ther. 198 (1986) (included only five patients), and Sandyk,
Cannoe, Stern and Snider Abstr. PP 331, 36 Neurology 342 (1986)
(included only three patients).</p>

<p>No scientific studies exist which test marijuana to relieve
spasticity. </p>

<p>National experts on MS reject marijuana as medicine. Doctor
Kenneth P. Johnson is chairman of the Department of Neurology at
the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He manages the
Maryland Center for MS, one of the most active MS research and
treatment centers in the United States. He sits on the editorial
boards of noted medical journals related to MS (Neurology and
Journal of Neuroimmunology). He is the author of over 100
scientific and medical articles on MS. Doctor Johnson has spent
mo st of his long career researching MS and has diagnosed and
treated more than 6,000 patients with MS. Doctor Johnson
testified:</p>

<p>At this time, I am not aware of...any legitimate medical
research in which marijuana was used to treat the symptoms of
multiple sclerosis. *** To conclude that marijuana is
therapeutically effective without conducting rigorous testing
would be professi onally irresponsible.</p>

<p>Doctor Stephen Reingold is Assistant Vice President of
Research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which
spends over $7 million each year on MS research. Only the Federal
Government spends more. Doctor Reingold testified:</p>

<p>I could find no actual published research which has used
marijuana.... In the existing research using THC, the results
were inconclusive.... In the absence of any well-designed,
well-controlled research..., the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society...d oes not endorse or advocate its use....</p>

<p>Doctor Donald H. Silberberg is Chairman of the Department of
Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
and Chief of the Neurology Service at the Hospital of
Pennsylvania. Doctor Silberberg is on the editorial board of
Annals of N eurology and is President of the National Medical
Advisory Board for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He
has been actively researching and treating MS for most of his
career, has written over 130 medical articles on MS and is
Co-Director of a lar ge MS research center at the University of
Pennsylvania. Doctor Silberberg testified:</p>

<p>I have not found any legitimate medical or scientific works
which show that marijuana...is medically effective in treating
multiple sclerosis or spasticity. *** The long-term treatment of
the symptoms of multiple sclerosis through the use of marijuana
could be devastating. *** [T]he use of (marijuana), especially
for long-term treatment...would be worse than the original
disease itself.</p>

<p>The only favorable evidence that could be found by NORML and
DEA consists of stories by marijuana users who claim to have been
helped by the drug. Scientists call these stories anecdotes. They
do not accept them as reliable proofs. The FDA&#146;s r
egulations, for example, provide that in deciding whether a new
drug is a safe and effective medicine, &#147;isolated case
reports...will not be considered.&#148; 21 CFR 314.126(e). Why do
scientists consider stories from patients and their doctors to b
e unreliable?</p>

<p>First, sick people are not objective scientific observers,
especially when it comes to their own health. We all have heard
of the placebo effect. Patients have a tendency to respond to
drugs as they believe is expected of them. Imagine how magnifie d
this placebo effect can be when a suffering person experiments on
himself, praying for some relief. Many stories no doubt are due
to the placebo effect, not to any real medical effects of
marijuana.</p>

<p>Second, most of the stories come from people who took
marijuana at the same time they took prescription drugs for their
symptoms. For example, Robert Randall claims marijuana has saved
his sight, yet he has taken standard glaucoma drugs continuously
since 1972. There is noobjective way to tell from these stories
whether it is marijuana that is helpful, or the proven,
traditional medicines. Even these users can never know for sure.</p>

<p>Third, any mind-altering drug that produces euphoria can make
a sick person think he feels better. Stories from patients who
claim marijuana helps them may be the result of the mind-altering
effects of the drug, not the results of improvements in the ir
conditions.</p>

<p>Fourth, long-time abusers of marijuana are not immune to
illness. Many eventually get cancer, glaucoma, MS and other
diseases. People who become dependent on mind-altering drugs tend
to rationalize their behavior. They invent excuses, which they ca
n come to believe, to justify their drug dependence. Stories of
marijuana&#146;s benefits from sick people with a prior history
of marijuana abuse may be based on rationalizations caused by
drug dependence, not on any medical benefits caused by the drug.
Robert Randall, for example, admits under oath to becoming a
regular marijuana user in 1968, four years before he showed the
first signs of, and was diagnosed as having, glaucoma. Since then
he has smoked marijuana 8 to 10 times every day.</p>

<p>A century ago many Americans relied on stories to pick their
medicines, especially from snake oil salesmen. Thanks to
scientific advances and to the passage of the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) in 1906, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seg., we now
rely on rigorous scientific proof to assure the safety and
effectiveness of new drugs. Mere stories are not considered an
acceptable way to judge whether dangerous drugs should be used as
medicines.</p>

<p>There are doctors willing to testify that marijuana has
medical uses. NORML found over a dozen to testify in this case.
We have a natural tendency to believe doctors. We assume their
opinions are entitled to respect. But what if a doctor is giving
an opinion beyond his professional competence? Evaluating the
safety and effectiveness of drugs is a specialized area. Does the
doctor have this specialized expertise? Is he familiar with all
the published scientific studies? Or is he improperly basi ng his
opinion on mere stories or anecdotal evidence? Does he really
know what he is talking about? Does he have a personal motive to
exaggerate or lie? Questions like these led the United States
Supreme Court, in 1973, to warn about the opinions of do ctors
concerning the value of drugs as medicine, when not supported by
rigorous scientific testing,</p>

<p>Weinberger v. Hynson, etc., 412 U.S. 609, 639:</p>

<p>[I]mpressions or beliefs of physicians, no matter how
fervently held, are treacherous.</p>

<p>Nearly half the doctors who testified for NORML are
psychiatrists. They do not specialize in treating or researching
cancer, glaucoma or MS. One is a general practitioner who works
as a wellness counselor at a health spa. Under oath he admits to
us ing every illegal, mind-altering drug he has ever studied, and
he prides himself on recommending drugs that would never be
recommended by medical schools or reputable physicians. Another
is a general practitioner who quit practicing in 1974. He admits
h e has not kept up on new medical and scientific information
about marijuana for 18 years.</p>

<p>Only one of the doctors called by NORML is a
nationally-recognized expert. Doctor John C. Merritt is a
board-certified ophthalmologist and researcher who has authored
articles on the use of marijuana and cannabinoids to reduce eye
pressure. He is in private practice and sees mostly children who
suffer from glaucoma. Doctor Merritt testified, &#147;[M]arijuana
is a highly effective IOP-lowering drug which may be of critical
value to some glaucoma patients who, without marijuana, would
progressively go blind.&#148; The last scientific study using
marijuana in glaucoma patients, published by Doctor Merritt in
1979, concluded:</p>

<p>It is because of the frequency and severity with which the
untoward events occurred thatmarijuana inhalation is not an ideal
therapeutic modality for glaucoma patients.</p>

<p>One year later, in 1980, Doctor Merritt gave the following
testimony, under oath, before the United States Congress, House
Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control:</p>

<p>For me to sit here and say that the lowering pressure effects
occurred repeatedly, day in and day out, I have no data, and
neither does anyone else, and that is the real crux of the
matter. When we are talking about treating a disease like
glaucoma, w hich is a chronic disease, the real issue is, does
the marijuana repeatedly lower the intraocular pressure? I have
shown you no...studies and to my knowledge there is no data to
that effect.</p>

<p>Doctor Merritt was unable to explain, under oath, the
contradictory positions he has taken on this subject.</p>

<p>Each of NORML&#146;s doctors testified his opinion is based on
the published scientific studies. With one exception, none of
them could identify under oath the scientific studies they swore
they relied on. Only one had enough knowledge to discuss th e
scientific technicalities involved. Eventually, each one admitted
he was basing his opinion on anecdotal evidence, on stories he
heard from patients, and on his impressions about the drug.</p>

<p>Sadly, Doctor Ivan Silverberg, an oncologist from San
Francisco, exaggerated while on the witness stand. At first he
swore &#147;there is voluminous medical research which shows
marijuana is effective in easing nausea and vomiting.&#148;
Pushed on c ross-examination to identify this voluminous
research, Doctor Silverberg replied, &#147;Well..., I&#146;m
going to have to back off a little bit from that.&#148; How far
would Doctor Silberberg back off? Was he aware, at least, of the
approximate number of scientific studies that have been done
using marijuana to treat nausea? Under oath, he replied, &#147;I
would doubt very few. But, no, I&#146;m not.&#148;</p>

<p>Beyond doubt, the claims that marijuana is medicine are false,
dangerous and cruel.</p>

<p>Sick men, women and children can be fooled by these claims and
experiment with the drug. Instead of being helped, they risk
serious side effects. If they neglect their regular medicines
while trying marijuana, the damage could be irreversible. It i s
a cruel hoax to offer false hope to desperately ill people.</p>

<p>Those who insist marijuana has medical uses would serve
society better by promoting or sponsoring more legitimate
scientific research, rather than throwing their time, money and
rhetoric into lobbying, public relations campaigns and perennial
litigati on.</p>

<p>Clarification of Currently Accepted Medical Use</p>

<p>The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 divides the universe of
all drugs of abuse into five sets or schedules. Drugs in Schedule
I are subject to the most severe controls, because they have a
high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States. 21 U.S.C. 812 (b) (1). Drugs of
abuse which have currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States are placed in Schedules II, III, IV and V.
Regrettably the Controlled Substances Act does not speak directly
to what is meant by &#147;currently accepted medical use.&#148;</p>

<p>A century before the Controlled Substances Act was enacted,
the determination of what drugs to accept as medicine was totally
democratic and totally standardless. Each patient and each
physician was free to decide for himself, often based on no more
than anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>This state of affairs became unsatisfactory to a majority of
the American people. In 1906, Congress intervened with the
passage of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). A shift began
away from anecdotal evidence to objectively conducted scientific
research, away fromuninformed opinions of lay persons and local
doctors to expert opinions of specialists trained to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of drugs, and away from totally
democratic decision-making to oversight by the Federal
Government.</p>

<p>By 1969, Congress had developed detailed Federal statutory
criteria under the FDCA to determine whether drugs are acceptable
for medical use. Those deemed acceptable can be marketed
nationally. Those deemed unacceptable are subject to Federal
seizur e if marketed interstate. The FDCA is a very complex
regulatory scheme not easily summarized. However, it is fair to
say that drugs falling into one of four FDCA categories were
accepted by Congress for medical use.</p>

<p>First, Congress accepted new drugs which have been approved by
FDA&#146;s experts as safe and effective for use in treatment,
based on substantial scientific evidence. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and
355 (so-called &#147;NDA-approved drugs&#148;).</p>

<p>Second, Congress accepted those drugs &#147;generally
recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as
safe and effective,&#148; based on substantial scientific
evidence. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and 355; Weinberger v. Bentex
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U.S.645 (1973). An acronym for this
category is &#147;human GRASE drugs&#148; (Generally Recognized
As Safe and Effective). These drugs achieve acceptance through
rigorous scienti fic proof, through a past history of widespread
use in treatment in the United States, and through recognition by
a consensus of drug experts outside the FDA.</p>

<p>Third, Congress accepted for use in veterinary medicine those
drugs &#147;generally recognized, among experts qualified by
scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective,&#148; based
on substantial scientific evidence. 21 U.S.C. 321(w) and 355. An
acronym for these is &#147;animal GRASE drugs.&#148; They achieve
acceptance through rigorous scientific evidence and through
recognition by a consensus of drug experts outside the FDA. U
nlike human GRASE drugs, animal GRASE drugs need not have a past
history of widespread use.</p>

<p>Finally, Congress accepted those drugs marketed prior to 1938
which had been subject to the 1906 provisions of the FDCA,
provided these very old drugs retain their exact formulations and
are never promoted for new uses. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and (w). The se
are politically &#147;grandfathered&#148; drugs. They need not
meet modern standards for safety and effectiveness.</p>

<p>A fifth group of drugs was accepted for research use only, not
for use in treatment of patients. 21U.S.C. 355(I) (so-called
&#147;IND or approved investigational new drugs&#148;).</p>

<p>Drugs intended for medical use and shipped interstate are
subject to Federal seizure under the FDCA if they do not fit
within one of the above accepted sets or groupings. It seems fair
to say that seizable drugs were rejected by Congress for medical
use.</p>

<p>In enacting the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, could
Congress have intended to create a totally new Federal standard
for determining whether drugs have accepted medical uses? Or did
Congress intend to rely on standards it had developed over the pr
ior 64 years under the FDCA? There is nothing in the Controlled
Substances Act, its legislative history, or its purposes that
would indicate Congress intended to depart radically from
existing Federal law.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems likely that the core standards developed
under the FDCA represent a long-term consensus of expert medical
and scientific opinion concerning when a drug should be accepted
by anyone as safe and effective for medical use.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a way to corroborate what Congress
intended. Congress did more than just announce criteria for
scheduling drugs of abuse under the Controlled Substances
Act;Congress applied those criteria to an initial listing of
drugs that it placed into the original five schedules of the Act.</p>

<p>NDA-approved drugs were placed by Congress into Schedules II,
III, IV and V of the Act. For example, pethidine (also known as
meperidine) received New Drug Application (NDA) approval in 1942.
Congress put it into Schedule II(b) (14). Methamphetamin e had an
approved NDA. Congress put it into Schedule III(a) (3). I am not
aware of any drug with an approved NDA that Congress originally
put into Schedule I.</p>

<p>Drugs with medical uses, but without approved NDA&#146;s also
were placed by Congress into Schedules II, III, IV and V. For
example, cocaine was put into Schedule II(a) (4). Codeine
combinations were put into Schedules III(d) (I) and V. Morphine
co mbinations were put into Schedule III(d) (8). Phenobarbital
was put into Schedule IV(11). Barbiturates were put into Schedule
III(b) (1). Amphetamines were put into Schedule III(a) (1).</p>

<p>The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was correct when it
decided in Grinspoon v. DEA, 828 F.2d 881 (1987) that NDA
approval is not the only method by which drugs can achieve
Federal recognition as having medical uses. Congress put both
GRASE an d pre-1938-grandfathered drugs into Schedules II, III,
IV and V of the CSA.</p>

<p>Drugs recognized under the FDCA for research use only, not for
use in treatment, such as alphacetylmethadol and marijuana, were
placed by Congress into Schedule I.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Federal records are not complete enough to do a
comprehensive mathematical mapping, tracing every drug in the
initial Controlled Substances Act schedules back to its legal
status under the FDCA. Nevertheless, determining legislative in
tent does not require mathematical certainty. Probability based
on circumstantial evidence, on samplings, and in inductive
reasoning can suffice, especially when there is nowhere else to
turn.</p>

<p>The pattern of initial scheduling of drugs in the Controlled
Substances Act, viewed in light of the prior legal status of
these drugs under the FDCA, convinces me that Congress equated
the term &#147;currently accepted medical use in treatment in the
United States&#148; as used in the Controlled Substances Act with
the core FDCA standards for acceptance of drugs for medical sue.</p>

<p>This is not to say that every FDCA requirement for GRASE
status, or for NDA approval, is pertinent to scheduling
determinations under the Controlled Substances Act. There are
differences. But the core FDCA criteria appear to have guided the
Congress in the decisions it made concerning the initial
scheduling of drugs in the Act.</p>

<p>These same core FDCA criteria served as the basis for an
eight-point test used by my predecessor as Administrator to
describe drugs with currently accepted medical uses.</p>

<p>54 FR 53783 (December 29, 1989):</p>

<p>1.Scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its
chemistry;</p>

<p>2.The toxicology and pharmacology of the substance in animals;</p>

<p>3.Establishment of its effectiveness in humans through
scientifically designed clinical trials;</p>

<p>4.General availability of the substance and information
regarding the substance and its use;</p>

<p>5.Recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references, journals or textbooks;</p>

<p>6.Specific indications for the treatment of recognized
disorders;</p>

<p>7.Recognition of the use of the substance by organizations or
associations of physicians; and </p>

<p>8.Recognition and use of the substance by a substantial
segment of the medical practitioners in the United States.</p>

<p>Some uncertainty remains over the precise meaning and
application of parts of this test. Therefore, the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded these
proceedings for a further explanation. In addition to addressing
those parts o f the test that concerned the Court of Appeals, it
would be useful to clarify the entire test, pinpoint its origins,
and identify which elements are both necessary and sufficient to
establish a prima facie case of currently accepted medical use.
This is not an effort to change the substantive law. The
statutory meaning of currently accepted medical use remains the
same as enacted by Congress in 1970. My purpose simply is to
clarify this Agency&#146;s understanding of the law.</p>

<p>A. The Drug&#146;s Chemistry Must Be Known and Reproducible.</p>

<p>The ability to recreate a drug in standardized dosages is
fundamental to testing that drug and to using it as a medicine.
Knowing the composition, properties, methods of production, and
methods of analysis of a drug is essential to reproducing it in
standardized dosages. To be GRASE or to receive NDA approval, a
drug&#146;s chemistry must be known and reproducible. See e.g.,
21 CFR 314.50(d) (1) and 314.126(b) (7) (d); Dorovic v.
Richardson, 749F.2d 242, 251 (7th Cir. 1973). The listing of a
drug in a current edition of one of the official compendia
normally satisfies this requirement. 21 U.S.C. 321(j); 21 CFR
314.50(d) (1).</p>

<p>The first element of our eight-point test, namely,
&#147;scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its
chemistry,&#148; should be clarified to read:</p>

<p>The substance&#146;s chemistry must be scientifically
established to permit it to be reproduced into dosages which can
be standardized. The listing of the substance in a current
edition of one of the official compendia, as defined by Section
201(j) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(j), is
sufficient generally to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>Acceptance of this knowledge will be discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p>B. There Must Be Adequate Safety Studies</p>

<p>No drug can be considered safe in the abstract. Safety has
meaning only when judged against the intended use of the drug,
its known effectiveness, its known and potential risks, the
severity of the illness to be treated, and the availability of
alter native therapies. Hess &amp; Clark Division of Rhodia, Inc.
v. FDA, 495 F.2d 975, 993 (D.C. Cir. 1974). To know the risks,
there must be adequate studies, by all methods reasonably
applicable, to show the pharmacological and toxicological effects
of the drug. 21 CFR 314.125(b) (2). This includes animal studies
and clinical trials in large numbers of humans. 21 CFR 312.21.
The studies need not be well-controlled, but they must be
adequate. Edison Pharmaceuticals Co. v. FDA, 600 F.2d 831 (D.C.
Cir. 1 979). Short term (acute) studies of a drug intended to
treat long term (chronic) illness, such as glaucoma or MS, are
clearly inadequate. United States v. Naremco, Inc., 553 F.2d
1138, 1143 (8th Cir. 1977). The second element of our eight-point
test, n amely, &#147;the toxicology and pharmacology of the
substance in animals,&#148; should be clarified as follows:</p>

<p>There must be adequate pharmacological and toxicological
studies, done by all methods reasonably applicable, on the basis
of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded, by experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of drugs, that the substance is safe for
treating a specific, recognized disorder.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that while the existence of adequate
safety tests is a separate analytical question, the ultimate
determination of whether a drug is safe for a specific use is not
adistinct issue. Safety and effectiveness are inextricably linked
in a risks-benefits calculation. A determination that a drug is
ineffective is tantamount to a determination that it is unsafe.
United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544 (1970).</p>

<p>The scheduling criteria of the Controlled Substances Act
appear to treat the lack of medical use and lack of safety as
separate considerations. Prior rulings of this Agency purported
to treat safety as a distinct factor. 53 FR 5156 (February 22,
198 8). In retrospect, this is inconsistent with scientific
reality. Safety cannot be treated as a separate analytical
question.</p>

<p>C. There Must Be Adequate and Well-Controlled Studies Proving
Efficacy.</p>

<p>Since 1962, Congress has prohibited the FDA to approve an NDA
unless the applicant submits adequate, well-controlled,
well-designed, well-conducted, and well-documented studies,
performed by qualified investigators, which prove the efficacy of
a drug for its intended use. 21 U.S.C. 355(d); 21 CFR 314.126.
Similarly, a drug cannot be considered GRASE unless it is
supported by this same quantity and quality of scientific proof.
21 CFR 314.200(e) (I); Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc. , 412 U.S. 609,
629 (19 73).</p>

<p>Studies involving related, but not identical, drugs are
irrelevant. United States v. Articles of Food &amp; Drug, 518
F.2d 743, 747 (5th Cir. 1975). Studies involving the same </p>

<p>drug combined with other drugs are irrelevant. United States
v. Articles of Drug...Promise Toothpaste, 826 F.2d 564, 570 (7th
Cir. 1987). Incomplete studies are insufficient. United States v.
Articles of Food &amp; Drug, supra. Uncontrolled studies a re
insufficient. 21 U.S.C. 355(d); Cooper Labs v. FDA, 501 F.2d 772,
778 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Statistically insignificant studies are
insufficient. 21 CFR 312.21, 314.50(d) (6) and 314.126(b) (7).
Poorly designed studies are insufficient. 21 CFR 314.126( b) (2).
Poorly conducted studies are insufficient. 21 CFR Part 58 - -
Good Laboratory Practices. Poorly documented studies are
insufficient. 21 CFR 312.58 and 314.200(e) (4). Studies by
investigators who are not qualified, both to conduct and to eval
uate them, are insufficient. 21 U.S.C. 355(d). Moreover, since
scientific reliability requires a double examination with similar
results, one valid study is insufficient. There must be two or
more valid studies which corroborate each other. See l J. O
&#146;Reilley &#147;Food and Drug Administration&#148; 13-55 n.12
(1985).</p>

<p>Lay testimonials, impressions of physicians, isolated case
studies, random clinical experience, reports so lacking in
details they cannot be scientifically evaluated, and all other
forms of anecdotal proof are entirely irrelevant. 21 CFR
314.126(e); Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 630 (1973).</p>

<p>Element three of our eight-point test, namely,
&#147;establishment of its effectiveness in humans through
scientifically designed clinical trials,&#148; should be restated
as:</p>

<p>There must be adequate, well-controlled, well-designed,
well-conducted and well-documented studies, including clinical
investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, on
the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded
by such experts that the substance will have the intended effect
in treating a specific, recognized disorder.</p>

<p>D. Acceptance by Qualified Experts Is Required.</p>

<p>The opinions of lay persons are totally irrelevant to whether
a drug is GRASE or meets NDA requirements. The observations and
opinions of medical practitioners who are not experts in
evaluating drugs also are irrelevant to whether a drug is GRASE
or meets NDA requirements.</p>

<p>Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 619 (1973). By
explicit requirements in the FDCA since 1938, the only body of
opinion that counts is that of experts qualified by scientific
trainingand experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
of d rugs. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and (w).</p>

<p>From this, one would conclude that expert acceptance of a drug
as safe and effective for its intended use is essential to a drug
having a currently accepted medical use under the CSA. How
widespread must this expert acceptance be?</p>

<p>To be GRASE, a drug must be &#147;generally recognized&#148;
among experts as safe and effective for its intended use. The
drug must be known or familiar to the national community of
relevant experts. United States v Articles of Drug...Furestrol
Vag inal Suppositories, 294 F. Supp. 1307, 1309 (N.D. Ga. 1968)
aff&#146;d, 415 F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1969). To determine if a drug
is known to the community of experts, courts have looked to
whether there is widely available scientific literature about the
dru g, Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc. v. United States,
629 F.2d 795, 803 (2d Cir. 1980), whether it is widely taught in
medical schools, Lemmon Pharmaceuticals Co. v. Richardson, 319 F.
Supp. 375, 378 (E.D. Pa. 1970), and whether it is widely discus
sed by experts. United States v. Bentex Ulcerine, 469 F.2d 875,
880 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>

<p>The recognition of a drug as GRASE need not be universal.
General recognition is sufficient. United States v. 41
Cartons...Ferro-Lac, 420 F.2d 1126, 1132 (5th Cir. 1970). The
Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean a consensus of experts
is fami liar with and accepts a drug as safe and effective.
Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 629 (1973). However, if
there is a serious dispute among the experts, a drug cannot be
considered GRASE. United States v. An Article of Food...Coco
Rico, 752 F.2d 11, 15 (lst Cir. 1985); Merrit Corp. v. Folsom,
165 F. Supp. 418, 421 (D.D.C. 1958).</p>

<p>During the NDA process, the FDA may reach out to the expert
community for its views. 21 CFR 314.103© (3). The FDA need not
determine that a drug is generally known and accepted by the
expert community. Nor must the FDA develop a consensus of op
inion among outside experts. The FDA has both the experts and the
statutory mandate to resolve conflicts over the safety and
efficacy of new drugs. Weinberger v. Bentex Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., 412 U.S. 638, 653 (1973).</p>

<p>In drafting the Controlled Substances Act, Congress appears to
have accommodated, rather than chosen from these different FDCA
standards. Clearly, the Controlled Substances Act does not
authorize the Attorney General, nor by delegation the DEA Admini
strator, to make the ultimate medical and policy decision as to
whether a drug should be used as medicine. Instead, he is limited
to determining whether others accept a drug for medical use. Any
other construction would have the effect of reading the wo rd
&#147;accepted&#148; out of the statutory standard. Since
Congress recognized NDA-approved drugs as having currently
accepted medical uses, without any need for a national consensus
of experts, FDA acceptance of a drug through the NDA process
would see m to satisfy the Controlled Substances Act. And, since
Congress recognized GRASE drugs as having currently accepted
medical uses, without the need for NDA approval, acceptance of a
drug by a national consensus of experts also would seem to
satisfy the Ac t.</p>

<p>When a drug lacks NDA approval and is not accepted by a
consensus of experts outside FDA, it cannot be found by the
Attorney General or his delegate to have a currently accepted
medical use. To do so would require the Attorney General to
resolve comp lex scientific and medical disputes among experts,
to decide the ultimate medical policy question, rather than
merely determine whether the drug is accepted by others.</p>

<p>Because the recognition of a drug by non-experts is irrelevant
to GRASE status, to NDAapproval, and to currently accepted
medical use under the Controlled Substances Act, points seven and
eight of our eight-point test should be combined and restated a s
follows:</p>

<p>The drug has a New Drug Application (NDA) approved by the Food
and Drug Administration pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. Or, a consensus of the national community of
experts, qualified by scientific training and experience to
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, accepts the
safety and effectiveness of the substance for use in treating a
specific, recognized disorder. A material conflict of opinion
among experts precludes a finding of consensus.</p>

<p>This restatement also incorporates the component of part one
of our eight-point test concerning &#147;accepted knowledge of
its chemistry.&#148;</p>

<p>E. The Scientific Evidence Must Be Widely Available. </p>

<p>Nothing in the FDCA, nor in FDA&#146;s regulations, requires
that scientific evidence supporting an NDA be published. This
stems from the fact that a consensus of experts outside FA is not
required for NDA approval. In contrast, most courts have hel d
that a drug cannot be considered GRASE unless the supporting
scientific evidence appears in the published scientific and
medical literature. Without published studies, it would be
difficult for the community of experts outside FDA to develop an
informe d acceptance of a drug for medical use. Cooper Labs Inc.
v. FDA, 501 F.2d 772, 786 (D.C. Cir. 1974).</p>

<p>Point four of the eight-point test focuses, in part, on the
&#147;general availability of information regarding the substance
and its use.&#148; This should be clarified to read:</p>

<p>In the absence of NDA approval, information concerning the
chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and effectiveness of the
substance must be reported, published, or otherwise widely
available, in sufficient detail to permit experts, qualified by
scientifi c training and experience to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of drugs, to fairly and responsibly conclude the
substance is safe and effective for use in treating a specific,
recognized disorder.</p>

<p>F. General Availability of a Drug Is Irrelevant.</p>

<p>The second component of point four of the eight-point test
involves the &#147;general availability of the substance&#148;
for use in treatment. The second component of point eight focuses
on &#147;use of the substance by a substantial segment of the
medical practitioners in the United States.&#148; These elements
justifiably concerned the Court of Appeals, leading to the remand
in this case.</p>

<p>Under the FDCA, a human GRASE drug must have a material
history of past use in treatment in the United States. 21 U.S.C.
321 (p) (2) (which has..., otherwise than in such investigations,
been used to a material extent or a material time); Weinberger v.
Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 631 (1973). Rigorous scientific
proofs and current unanimous acceptance by the medical and
scientific community are not enough for a human drug to be GRASE.
Tri-Bio Labs, Inc. v. United States, 836 F.2d 135, 142 n.8 (3d
Cir .. 1987). The general availability of a drug for use in
treatment is a factor courts have considered to determine if a
human drug is GRASE.</p>

<p>In contrast, a drug can achieve current acceptance for human
medical use through the NDA process without a past history of
medical use in treatment. Also, animal drugs can become accepted
as GRASE without any past history of medical use. Given this
conflict in FDCA standards, which did Congress choose when
drafting the CSA?</p>

<p>As the Court of Appeals points out, requiring a material
history of past use in treatment before recognizing a drug as
having a currently accepted medical use, would permanently
freezeall Schedule I drugs into Schedule I. 930 F.2d at 940.
Clearly, C ongress did not intend this result. Moreover, the use
of the word &#147;currently&#148; before the term &#147;accepted
medical use&#148; would indicate Congress rejected the human
GRASE requirement of past material use in treatment. I conclude
that the general availability of a drug is irrelevant to whether
it has a currently accepted medical use in treatment within the
meaning of the Controlled Substances Act.</p>

<p>G. Recognition in Generally Accepted Texts Is Irrelevant.</p>

<p>Point five of the eight-point test deals with
&#147;recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references, journals or textbooks.&#148;
The listing of a drug in an official compendium is sufficient to
show its chemist ry is scientifically established. This appears
in my clarification to point one. The requirement that
information concerning the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology
and effectiveness of the substance be reported, published or
otherwise widely available, is explained adequately in revised
point four. To the extent the scheduling of a drug directly
influences its recognition in publications, this element is
subject to the same criticism identified by the Court of Appeals
concerning point four. Therefore , this should not be treated as
a distinct requirement.</p>

<p>H. Specific, Recognized Disorders Are the Referent.</p>

<p>It is impossible to judge the safety and effectiveness of a
drug except in relation to a specific intended use. A drug cannot
obtain NDA approval or GRASE status except in relation to the
treatment of a specific, recognized disorder. This is an esse
ntial aspect of whether a drug has currently accepted medical
use. Rather than standing alone, this requirement will be more
clearly understood by incorporating it into the other critical
elements.</p>

<p>To summarize, the five necessary elements of a drug with
currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States
are:</p>

<p>(I) The Drug&#146;s Chemistry Must Be Known and Reproducible</p>

<p>The substance&#146;s chemistry must be scientifically
established to permit it to be reproduced into dosages which can
be standardized. The listing of the substance in a current
edition of one of the official compendia, as defined by Section
201(j) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(j), is
sufficient generally to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>(ii) There Must Be Adequate Safety Studies</p>

<p>There must be adequate pharmacological and toxicological
studies done by all methods reasonably applicable on the basis of
which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded, by experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the
sa fety and effectiveness of drugs, that the substance is safe
for treating a specific, recognized disorder.</p>

<p>(iii) There Must Be Adequate and Well-Controlled Studies
Proving Efficacy</p>

<p>There must be adequate, well-controlled, well-designed,
well-conducted and well-documented studies, including clinical
investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs on
the b asis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded
by such experts, that the substance will have its intended effect
in treating a specific, recognized disorder. </p>

<p>(iv) The Drug Must Be Accepted by Qualified Experts</p>

<p>The drug must have a New Drug Application (NDA) approved by
the Food and Drug Administration, pursuant to the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act. 21 U.S.C. 355. Or, a consensus of the national
community of experts, qualified by scientific training and experi
ence to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, must
accept the safety and effectiveness of the substance for use in
treating a specific, recognized disorder. A materialconflict of
opinion among experts precludes a finding of consensus.</p>

<p>(v) The Scientific Evidence Must Be Widely Available</p>

<p>In the absence of NDA approval, information concerning the
chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and effectiveness of the
substance must be reported, published, or otherwise widely
available in sufficient detail to permit experts, qualified by
scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of drugs, to fairly and responsibly conclude the
substance is safe and effective for use in treating a specific,
recognized disorder.</p>

<p>Together these five elements constitute prima facie evidence
that a drug has currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States. In the interest of total clarity, let me
emphasize those proofs that are irrelevant to the determination
of currently accepted medical use, and that will not be
considered by the Administrator: </p>

<p>(I) Isolated case reports;</p>

<p>(ii) Clinical impressions of practitioners;</p>

<p>(iii) Opinions of persons not qualified by scientific training
and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
substance at issue;</p>

<p>(iv) Studies or reports so lacking in detail as to preclude
responsible scientific evaluation;</p>

<p>(v) Studies or reports involving drug substances other than
the precise substance at issue;</p>

<p>(vi) Studies or reports involving the substance at issue
combined with other drug substances;</p>

<p>(vii) Studies conducted by persons not qualified by scientific
training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
of the substance at issue;</p>

<p>(viii) Opinions of experts based entirely on unrevealed or
unspecified information</p>

<p>(ix) Opinions of experts based entirely on theoretical
evaluations of safety or effectiveness.</p>

<p>Bad Medicine By Any Standard</p>

<p>My predecessor as DEA Administrator developed and relied upon
an eight-point test to determine whether marijuana has accepted
medical uses. 54 FR 53783 (December 29, 1989):</p>

<p>1.Scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its
chemistry;</p>

<p>2.The toxicology and pharmacology of the substance in animals;</p>

<p>3.Establishment of its effectiveness in humans through
scientifically designed clinical trials;</p>

<p>4.General availability of the substance and information

<p>6.Specific indications for the treatment of recognized

<p>7.Recognition of the use of the substance by organizations or
associations of physicians; and</p>

<p>8.Recognition and use of the substance by a substantial
segment of the medical practitioners</p>

<p>in the United States. </p>

<p>The Court of Appeals remanded the decision of my predecessor
for clarification of what role factors (4), (5) and (8) of the
initial eight-point test played in his reasoning. For ease of
discussion, these factors can be divided as follows:</p>

<p>(4) (a) General availability of the substance...;</p>

<p>(4) (b) General availability of...information regarding the
substance and its use;</p>

<p>(5) Recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia; medical references, journals or textbooks;</p>

<p>(8)(a) Recognition...of the substance by a substantial segment
of the medical practitioners in the United States; and</p>

<p>(8) (b) [U]se of the substance by a substantial segment of the
medical practitioners in theUnited States.</p>

<p>I have found no evidence indicating initial factors (4) (a) or
(8) (b) played any role in my predecessor&#146;s decision. In
light of my understanding of the legal standard involved, these
factors are irrelevant to whether marijuana has a currently a
ccepted medical use.</p>

<p>My predecessor emphasized the lack of scientific evidence of
marijuana&#146;s effectiveness, and the limited data available on
its risks, as reflected in the published scientific studies. He
also emphasized the importance of this data to the conclusi ons
reached by experts concerning the drug. 54 FR 53783. I take this
to mean that, under initial factor (4) (b), he believed the
information available to experts is insufficient for them
responsibly and fairly to conclude that marijuana is safe and
effec tive for use as medicine</p>

<p>Marijuana is not recognized as medicine in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references and textbooks, as noted by my
predecessor. 54 FR 53784. I take this to mean, under initial
factor (5), that he determined that marijuana&#146;s chemistry is
neither known, no reproducible, as evidenced by its absence from
the official pharmacopeia. Finally, my predecessor concluded,
under initial factor (8) (a), that the vast majority of
physicians does not accept marijuana as having medical use. 54 FR
5 3784. Along the way, he found that highly respected oncologists
and antiemetic researchers reject marijuana for use in
controlling nausea and vomiting, 54 FR 5377, that experts
experienced in researching glaucoma medications reject marijuana
for use in t reating glaucoma, 54 FR 53779, and that noted
neurologists who specialize in treating and conducting research
in spasticity reject marijuana for use by MS patients, 54 FR
53780. I take this to mean my predecessor found no national
consensus of qualified experts accepts marijuana&#146;s value as
medicine.</p>

<p>Certainly I cannot know my predecessor&#146;s unstated
reasoning. However, I have reviewed the entire record de novo,
and I am convinced that his application of the initial
eight-point test to this record correctly resulted in the
conclusion that mar ijuana has no currently accepted medical use
in treatment in the United States. Therefore, I adopt in their
entirety the findings of facts and conclusions of law reached by
the former Administrator in his final order of December 21, 1989,
54 FR 53767.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the remand of the Court of Appeals, I have
condensed and clarified the initial standard into a five-point
test. My application of the refined, five-point test to this
record is set out briefly below.</p>

<p>First, marijuana&#146;s chemistry is neither fully known, nor
reproducible. Thus far, over 400 different chemicals have been
identified in the plant. The proportions and concentrations
differ from plant to plant, depending on growing conditions, age
of the plant, harvesting and storage factors. THC levels can vary
from less than 0.2% to over 10%. It is now known how smoking or
burning the plant material affects the composition of all these
chemicals. It is not possible to reproduce the drug in dos ages
which can be considered standardized by any currently accepted
scientific criteria. Marijuana is not recognized in any current
edition of the official compendia. 21 U.S.C. 321(j).</p>

<p>Second, adequate safety studies have not been done. All
reasonably applicable pharmacological and toxicological studies
have not been carried out. Most of the chronic animal studies
have been conducted with oral or intravenous THC, not with
marijuan a. Pharmacological data on marijuana&#146;s
bioavailability, metabolic pathways and pharmacokinetics is
inadequate. Studies in humans are too small and too few.
Sophisticated epidemiological studies of marijuana use in large
populations are required, si milar to those done for tobacco use.
Far too many questions remain unknown for experts fairly and
responsibly to conclude marijuana is safe for any use.</p>

<p>Third, there are no adequate, well-controlled scientific
studies proving marijuana is effectivefor anything.</p>

<p>Fourth, marijuana is not accepted for medical use in treatment
by even a respectable minority, much less a consensus, of experts
trained to evaluate drugs. The FDA&#146;s expert drug evaluators
have rejected marijuana for medical use. No NDA has bee n
approved by FDA for marijuana. The testimony of nationally
recognized experts overwhelmingly rejects marijuana as medicine,
compared to the scientifically empty testimony of the
psychiatrists, a wellness counselor and general practitioners
presented by NORML.</p>

<p>Fifth, given my conclusions on points one, two and three, it
follows that the published scientific evidence is not adequate to
permit experts to fairly and responsibly conclude that marijuana
is safe and effective for use in humans.</p>

<p>A failure to meet just one of the five points precludes a drug
from having a currently accepted medical use. Marijuana fails all
five points of the test.</p>

<p>NORML has argued, unsuccessfully, that the legal standard for
currently accepted medical use should be whether a respectable
minority of physicians accepts the drug. The key to this medical
malpractice defense is that the minority opinion must be rec
ognized as respectable, as competent, by members of the
profession.</p>

<p>In the absence of reliable evidence adequately establishing
marijuana&#146;s chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and
effectiveness, no responsible physician could conclude that
marijuana is safe and effective for medical use. To quote Doctor
Kenneth P. Johnson, Chairman of the Department of Neurology at
the University of Maryland, and the author of over 100 scientific
and medical articles on MS: &#147;To conclude that marijuana is
therapeutically effective without conducting rigorous testing
would be professionally irresponsible.&#148;</p>

<p>By any modern scientific standard, marijuana is no medicine.</p>
