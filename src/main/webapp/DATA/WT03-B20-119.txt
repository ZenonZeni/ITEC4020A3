<h1>Renewable Energy: Wind</h1><p>
<p>
Wind has become a viable source of electric energy for utilities. 
Utility-scale
wind power plants consist of 100 to 1000 wind turbines that are located 
close
to each other, have a single electrical connection to the utility grid, 
and can
be managed from a single control room.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Excellent wind resources are widely dispersed throughout the world.  
Almost
every country has some areas with good wind resources.<p>

Power in the wind is proportional to the cube of the wind speed.  
Therefore,
locations with higher average wind speeds have much higher energy 
resources.
The windier the location, the more kilowatt-hours (kWh) can be produced 
by the
same equipment, and the lower the overall cost of energy.<p>

The total U.S. wind resource is very large.  Although every region in the

country has some windy areas, much of the U.S. wind resources are 
concentrated
in the Great Plains.  For example, <b><i>the state of North Dakota alone 
has
enough energy from good wind areas to supply 36% of the 1990 electricity
consumption in the lower 48 states</i></b>. <p>

Many windy locations are in remote areas, far from load centers, and do 
not
have transmission lines nearby.   <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
Wind power plant electricity generating costs have gone from $0.30/kWh in 
1981
to $0.05/kWh in 1990--an 84% decrease in cost.<p>

In California, 1700 megawatts (MW) of rated capacity is installed (as 
much as
that of two large coal-fired power plants); in Europe, another 1000 MW is

installed (as much as that of one nuclear power plant).  The wind power 
plants
in California produce 3.1 billion kWh/year; this is 1.2% of the
electricity used by California or 0.1% of the electricity used by the 
United
States--enough to supply a residential city the size of San Francisco and

Washington, D.C., combined.  <p>

Existing wind power plants produce electricity at a levelized cost of 
$0.05 to
$0.08/kWh at a site with an average annual wind speed through the rotor 
of
15.4 miles per hour (mph).  Those turbines have a first cost as little as

$1,000/kW and last as long as 20 years.  New turbines are coming on line 
that
produce electricity at less than $0.05/kWh; they cost as little as 
$750/kW and
have expected lifetimes of 20 to 30 years. Turbine availability of power 
plants
is 95% or more, better than that of most conventional power plants.  
Operation
and maintenance costs are typically lower than those for conventional 
power
plants.<p>

Existing wind power plants exploit very windy locations with average 
annual
wind speeds of at least 16 mph.  The United States could supply 20% of 
its
electricity from these very windy locations with existing 
technology--producing
560,000 million kWh per year.  These areas cover 18,000 square 
miles--0.6%
of the lower 48 states.  Less than 5% of this land would be used by the
equipment and access roads; most of the existing land use, such as 
ranching and
farming, would continue as it is now.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
In the United States, 2000 to 5000 MW of new capacity are planned or are 
under
construction. A similar amount is planned or under construction in 11 
countries
in the European Union. Worldwide, sizable wind power plants are on the 
drawing
boards in Argentina, Chile, China, India, Mexico, and the Ukraine.<p>
By 2000, wind-generated electricity will cost as little as $0.04/kWh.  At 
this
price, it can compete with any type of conventional generation.<p>

<h2>Technology Development</h2>
Costs will be reduced through employing advanced wind technology; further

reducing operation and maintenance associated with new, larger power 
plants;
and manufacturers taking advantage of economies of scale in unit size,
purchasing, and production.<p>

New wind technologies to improve reliability and reduce costs include 
improved
aerodynamic performance of blades; improved design of mechanical 
components;
variable-speed and/or low-speed generators; and controls that increase 
system
efficiency and lifetime.<p>
