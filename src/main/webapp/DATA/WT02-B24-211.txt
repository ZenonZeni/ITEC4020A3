<H3>Dear Karen,
</H3><P>Being an egg donor has been a very special experience. Since I was
a teenager I wanted to do something that would make a difference in someone
else's life. Helping a mature\responsible couple have a baby who are unable
to conceive seemed an excellent way to fulfill my desire.
<P>The process requires time, involvement, perseverance, and personal dedication.
I was very fortunate because my family was completely supportive. At times
I questioned my involvement in the procedure because I had to devote myself
to helping a couple (that I didn't know) have a baby.
<P>As a mother of two beautiful children I understand the longing to be parents
and I hope that my personal involvement will help the recipient couple realize
their dream to have a family. Personally I feel happy with the decision I
have made and which that each one of us would do something positive to make
a difference in this world.
<P>
