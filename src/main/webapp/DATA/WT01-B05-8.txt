<H3>The American Tour de Sol</H3> The American Tour de Sol is an eight day
electric and solar vehicle road rally event from Connecticut to Maine,
with free public displays in nine different communities. It was started in
1989 by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association of Greenfield, MA to 
bring practical electric vehicles into everyday use.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/gas.gif" WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=205> The
event has grown from a back-yard event with six solar racing cars, to a
rally of international significance, showcasing 50 vehicles built by major
auto manufacturers, electric vehicle manufacturers, individuals and
students from North America and abroad. With over 55% of the air pollution
in the Northeast caused by fossil-fueled transportation, electric
transportation offers a practical solution today.<p>

There were thousands of interested spectators along the route and you can
read about the impressive results through these web pages.  NESEA wishes
to thank <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/">NREL</A> and its director, Dr.
Charles Gay, for supporting this web site.<P>
