<b>Trends in Teacher Entry, Retention, Turnover, Attrition, and Shortage in Special Education
</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40102 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will comprehensively analyze trends in the entry, retention, turnover,
teaching field transfer, and attrition of special education teachers (SETs) on the national
level.<P>

METHOD:  Project research is based on three iterations of two sets of sample surveys conducted
by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), USDE, which will include the Schools
and Staffing Surveys (SASS), and the Teacher Follow-up Surveys (TFS).  The SASS are
composed of several basic questionnaires administered by mail with extensive telephone
follow-up.  A stratified systematic probability proportionate-to-size selection procedure was used
to draw the SASS sample.  The TFS provides the only database at the national level for the study
of attrition from the teaching profession with a representative sample of teachers.  A major
feature
of the database is the inclusion of follow-up interviews of teachers who: (1) were retained in their
teaching positions; (2) transferred to different teaching positions; and (3) left the teaching
profession entirely.  This project provides the application of a multidimensional model for
tracking
teacher career transitions using three iterations of two national sample surveys.  All statistical
analyses will be based on the national estimates of teachers computed by applying appropriate
weights to the numbers of teachers in their respective samples.  The project will continue for a
42-month period, and the pace of the project has been designed in relation to the amount of
personnel resources budgeted and the availability of the SASS and TFS data bases for
research.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As a result of this project, a large amount of new information
will
be provided about the national status of, and trends in SET entry, retention, turnover, teaching
field transfer, attrition, and shortage.  The project will also result in considerable insight into the
dynamics of the SET teacher force and the teacher shortage problem. <P>

<b>The Role of Paraprofessionals in Quality Inclusive Educational Programs</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50016 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will study the role of the paraprofessional in quality inclusive education
programs, building an empirical base for this role and examining critical job competencies and
components of job descriptions.<P>

METHOD:  This study will examine the roles and responsibilities of eight paraprofessionals
working in grades 2-5.  Participants will be drawn from four elementary schools from four school
districts in New York State that have participated in a larger scale evaluation of their inclusive
programs.  Data collection will include interviews and direct observations of paraprofessionals,
as
well as interviews with the principals of participating schools, the director of special education
for
each district, parents of students with special needs who are being supported by
paraprofessionals,
and the general and special education teachers who work with these paraprofessionals.  In
addition, relevant district documents will be examined.  Study questions will address: (1) how
the
teaching team views the role and responsibilities of the paraprofessional; (2) paraprofessional
involvement in individual program planning; (3) types of job training paraprofessionals receive
to
prepare them to carry out their duties; (4) in what ways teaching assistants might be assigned to
work one-on-one with students with disabilities versus a support role within the class that
includes
work with students with and without disabilities.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research results could serve as a reference for paraprofessional
staff development and contribute to the national discussion of appropriate roles and
responsibilities for paraprofessionals in inclusive education.  Project staff hope to disseminate
findings through a presentation at one national conference.<P>

<b>Teacher Preparation for Diverse Classrooms: Performance-Based Assessment of Beginning
Teachers</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50041 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 10/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will use a performance-based assessment model to examine the effects
of preservice preparation factors on the degree to which beginning teachers use culturally
responsive teaching (CRT).<P>

METHOD:  The primary tool of assessment will be Praxis III, a performance-based assessment
for beginning teachers developed at the Educational Testing Service.  Research staff will
examine
how the following three preservice factors impact the practice of CRT by beginning teachers: (1)
preparation in general vs. special education teacher education programs; (2) levels of preservice
teacher preparation in cultural issues; and (3) preservice university preparation.  Using Praxis III,
investigators will gather records of evidence for 70 beginning teachers from general and special
teacher education programs at four universities in Florida.  Evidence will be gathered from
teacher and classroom profiles, pre- and post-observation interviews, and observations.  These
records will be analyzed with both qualitative (MANOVA) and quantitative methods.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings are expected to enhance the knowledge base of
teacher educators regarding preservice factors that may affect the practice of CRT by beginning
teachers.  Final products of the study will be disseminated through professional journals and
conference presentations to enhance the research base and provide methodological information to
researchers in cultural diversity, teacher education, and teacher assessment.<P>

<b>The Paraprofessional Role in Inclusion </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023A50092 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a study of the extent to which paraprofessionals are
currently involved in inclusion of children with disabilities and the nature of their roles.  The
project will also construct a framework that guides the range of ways in which paraprofessionals
could be constructively involved in the inclusion of students within the school and in the larger
community.<P>

METHOD:  Research will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods, including a mail
survey of 150 paraprofessionals working in inclusive classrooms at various grade levels and
locations to determine the nature and extent of their involvement in the educational process and
semistructured interviews with a smaller sample of 30 paraprofessionals to follow up on survey
findings in depth.  Follow-up interviews will focus on a purposeful sample of survey respondents
reflecting a range of ethnicity, roles in inclusion, awareness of issues, types of disability, and
geographic location.  Three separate focus groups will also be conducted to gain the unique
perspectives of parents, classroom teachers, and special education teachers.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Expected outcomes include a better understanding of the roles
paraprofessionals currently play and practical ways for school to improve inclusion practices
through the use of paraprofessionals. Findings will be distributed through written products and
conference presentations to families, educators, researchers, and paraprofessionals.<P>

<b>Development and Validation of a Partnership-Consultation-Collaboration-Professional 
Development Model to Bridge the Gap Between Research and Practice</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will articulate, implement, evaluate, and disseminate an existing model
designed to improve the practices of special and regular education teachers and of parents in
inner-city communities.<P>

METHOD:  Participants in the project will include 975 students (195 with disabilities), their
parents, 36 teachers and administrative staff of three school buildings in three school districts,
and
10 researchers.  Two of these schools will be from economically disadvantaged (over 35% in
poverty) urban communities.  Key components of the model to establish and maintain sustained
research-practice relationships between researchers and practitioners will address partnership,
collaboration, consultation, and professional development. Using a multiple baseline design
across
schools and a multi-method (qualitative and quantitative) measurement model, functional
relationships between use of the model and changes in implementation of practices, instructional
processes, and products/outcomes on students with and without disabilities will be examined. 
Additional participants will include the staff and students of a third, out-of-state replication
school
that will serve as an independent replication site for the model prior to national
dissemination.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to direct benefits to participants, the project will
result
in new knowledge in the form of empirical and qualitative findings concerning the model, its
components, processes, products, and outcomes.  This knowledge will be published in the
professional literature and used in preservice teacher training.  This knowledge will also be
represented in a "blueprint" of training, materials, media, and technology for replication in local
schools.<P>

<b>Collaborative Co-Planning Between General and Special Educators</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50063 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  1/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will evaluate the effectiveness of a structured collaborative co-planning
model for general and special educators. <P>

METHOD:  The model to be employed has been designed to: (1) increase the number of
instructional interventions generated and implemented by general and special education teachers
for students with learning disabilities included in the general education classroom; (2) increase
the
on-task classroom behavior of students with learning disabilities; (3) increase the number of
positive interactions between general and special educators and their students with learning
disabilities; (4) increase the number of positive interactions among students with learning
disabilities and their peers; (5) increase the general and special education teachers' perceptions of
positive academic achievement for students with disabilities; and (6) increase self-perceptions of
positive academic achievement among students with learning disabilities.  Forty-eight general
and
special education teachers from four local education agencies will participate in the project
through team or co-teaching arrangements in sixth grade classrooms.  Each teacher "team" will
have a minimum of two students with learning disabilities.  Qualitative and quantitative sources
(e.g., interviews, classroom observations, teacher reflections in journals and logs, and Likert-type
ratings instruments) will be utilized to examine the results of the project and the effectiveness of
the program.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings will have implications for LEA personnel in the
planning
and implementation of inclusive school or collaboration programs in which general and special
educators team or co-teach.  Additionally, results will impact preservice and inservice teacher
trainers as they attempt to replicate the model in developing new collaborative or inclusive
school
programs or refining extant programs.  Project results will be disseminated at the college level to
preservice teachers to provide them with valuable collaborative skills.  Project findings will also
be
disseminated through journal articles, conferences presentations, and inservice workshops.<P>
