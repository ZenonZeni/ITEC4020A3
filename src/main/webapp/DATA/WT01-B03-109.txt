<P>Critical for an analysis of how the recent decisions of the U. S. Supreme
Court affect gaming in Indian country and throughout the nation is an
understanding that Indian reservations are on federal trust land. The only laws
are federal or tribal. States have no jurisdiction over Indian reservations,
unless specific jurisdiction is specifically authorized by Congress.<BR>
<BR> Accordingly, unless prohibited by federal law, each Indian tribe or
nation, as a sovereign nation, can decide for itself what gambling may be
conducted on that reservation. When the state of California sought to prevent
the Cabazon tribe from conducting high stakes bingo on its reservation in the
1980's the U. S. Supreme Court held that California did not have that power.<BR>
<BR> In response to the Cabazon decision, Congress passed the Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA), and attempted to balance the interest between the
state and tribal sovereignty. The law states: &quot;Indian tribes have the
exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands, if ... not
specifically prohibited by federal law, and is conducted in a state which does
not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming
activity.&quot; IGRA established three classes of gaming. Class I, traditional
Indian games, was left unregulated. Class II, including bingo, lotto, pull tabs
and non-banking card games, was placed under federal supervision by the National
Indian Gaming Commission. Class III, includes all other forms of gaming.<BR>
<BR> To provide states with the opportunity to have input in the establishment
of Class III gaming IGRA provided that gaming could only be offered to the
public on Indian lands in a state that &quot;permits such gaming for any purpose
by any person, organization, or entity ... &quot; and then only in conformance
with a tribal/state compact entered into by the tribe and the state. Responding
to tribal concerns that a state may not negotiate in good faith if requested,
IGRA provided the tribes with federal court jurisdiction to enforce &quot;good
faith&quot;, and established the Secretary of the Interior as the ultimate
arbiter and regulator if an agreement could not be reached on a compact.<BR>
<BR> In September 1991, the Seminole Tribe of Florida sued the state and its
governor in federal court, alleging refusal to enter into negotiations for a
tribal/state compact. Florida moved to dismiss the suit on ground that suit
against the sovereign state of Florida was barred by the 11th Amendment to the
U. S. Constitution, which states in part: &quot;The judicial power of the United
States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced
or prosecuted against one of the United States ... &quot;<BR>
<BR> The 11th Circuit Court felt that the suit by the Seminoles against the
state of Florida wads barred by the 11th Amendment. The Court's decision also
addressed the question of remedies available to the tribe when its judicial
remedy is barred: &quot;The answer gleaned from the statute, is simple ... The
tribe may file suit in the District Court. If the state pleads an 11th Amendment
defense, the suit is dismissed and the tribe ... then may notify the Secretary
of the Interior. ... The Secretary then may prescribe regulations governing
Class III gaming on the tribe's lands. This solution conforms with IGRA and
serves to achieve Congress' goals.<BR>
<BR> The Seminole Tribe petitioned the U. S. Supreme Court for centiorari on
the main question, and the state of Florida cross petitioned, seeking reversal
of the 11th Circuit's substitute remedy. The U. S. Supreme Court hold that suit
against the state of Florida saying: &quot;Notwithstanding Congress' clear
intent to abrogate (in IGRA) the states' sovereign immunity, the Indian Commerce
Clause does not grant Congress that power, and therefore (IGRA) cannot grant
jurisdiction over a state that does not consent to be sued.&quot;<BR>
<BR> On the question of substitute remedy, the court merely noted that: &quot;We
do not here consider, and express no opinion upon the portion of the decision
below that provides a substitute remedy for a tribe bring suit.&quot; However,
one week later on, April 15, 1996, the Supreme Court denied the cross-petition
of the state of Florida, leaving in place the lower court's substitute remedy.<BR>
<BR> If the Secretary of the Interior meets his responsibility to the tribes as
carved out by the 11th Circuit, the State of Florida, and all states similarly
situated may have won the battle which lost the war, since a refusal to
negotiate or waive the state's immunity may lead to the imposition of a tribal
regulatory system <I>with no input from the state</I>. President Clinton has on
several occasions pledged his support of tribal sovereignty to Indian leaders
from around the country. This offers an opportunity for his administration to
demonstrate its good faith.<BR>
<BR> If Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt does not respond to the suggested
substitute remedy, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which has a host of
regulatory amendments ready for introduction, will undoubtedly try its hand at
salvaging the situation. Meanwhile expect a rush on the capital by tribes that
have been stalled by their respective state governments.<BR>
<BR> In apparent recognition of that fact the Secretary has published advance
notice of a proposed rulemaking, requesting public comments to the Bureau of
Indian Affairs by June 21. 1996.<BR>
<BR> If neither the Secretary nor Congress responds, the result would be a
stalemate that could be interpreted as a revision to the tribes' basic sovereign
rights.<BR> <BR>Although the Supreme Court has held that a state can not be
required to negotiate, any state that fails to waive its 11th Amendment rights
and negotiate, could find itself on the outside looking in.<BR>

<H4>by <A HREF="TGCAcji.html">Charles J. Irwin, Esq.</A>, General Counsel,
<BR>
<A HREF="TGCA.html">Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc.</A> and
<A HREF="tgmlaun.html">Tribal Gaming Management, Inc.</A></H4>
<P>The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, passed by Congress in response to the
decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Cabazon v. California, recognizes the
right of Indian tribes to conduct Class III gaming activities on their
reservations under certain conditions and the Act provided two mechanisms for
establishing the parameter within which Class III gaming can be offered by an
Indian Casino.<BR>
<BR> The first mechanism is via a tribal/state compact, negotiated by the tribe
or nation with the State, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.<BR>
<BR> Regulatory parameters can also be established by a regulation, prescribed
by the Secretary of the Interior when efforts to obtain a tribal/state compact
are unsuccessful.<BR>
<BR> Congress could have recognized the right of tribes to conduct Class III
gaming without State involvement, just as they did for Class II gaming. However,
when the legislation was being formulated, States were insisting that some state
control over gaming activities conducted within the borders of their State was
necessary. Tribal representatives urged that since their operations were on
federal trust land, the State should have no jurisdiction. Once the compromise
of a negotiated tribal/state compact was introduced, there was a need to answer
the question, &quot;Suppose the State refuses to negotiate, or does not
negotiate in good faith?&quot;<BR>
<BR> Congress, in its wisdom, responded that Class III gaming would be lawful
only if it is conducted:<BR>
<BR> (a) By a &quot;recognized&quot; tribe;<BR>
<BR> (b) in accordance with a tribal resolution or ordinance, approved by the
National Indian Gaming Commission;<BR>
<BR> (c) in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person,
organization or entity; <BR>
<BR> (d) &quot;...in conformance with a Tribal-State Compact entered into by
the Indian tribe and the State under paragraph (3) that is in effect&quot;.<BR>
<BR> Section 2710(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides that upon receipt of a request
for compact negotiations from a tribe, &quot;...the State shall negotiate with
the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.&quot; (Emphasis
added).<BR>
<BR> In an attempt to satisfy the concerns of the tribes, Congress made the
State's obligation to negotiate in good faith judicially enforceable in Sections
2710(d)(7)(A)(i) and (B)(i) as follows:<BR>
<BR> &quot;(A)(i) The United States District Courts shall have jurisdiction
over any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failure
of the State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of
entering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct such
negotiations in good faith....<BR>
<BR> &quot;(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described in
subparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on the
date on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiations
under paragraph (3)(A).&quot;<BR>
<BR> In September 1991, the Seminole Tribe sued Florida and its governor for
refusing to enter into negotiations for a Tribal-State compact. Florida's motion
to dismiss the Seminole suit as violating the State's sovereign immunity from
suit was denied by the Federal District Court.<BR>
<BR> The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and held
that the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution barred the Seminole suit against
the State.<BR>
<BR> The Eleventh Amendment provides:<BR>
<BR> &quot;The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to
extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the
United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any
Foreign State.&quot;<BR>
<BR> The U.S. Supreme Court in the case at hand held (5 to 4) that:<BR>
<BR> &quot;Notwithstanding Congress' clear intent to abrogate the States'
sovereign immunity, the Indian Commerce Clause does not grant Congress that
power, and therefore Section 2710(d)(7) cannot grant jurisdiction over a State
that does not consent to be sued. We further hold that the doctrine of Ex parte
Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), may not be used to enforce Section 2710(d)(3)
against a state official.&quot;<BR>
<BR> Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down the tribal right to force
the State to the bargaining table to compact, what mechanism, if any, is
available to establish legal regulatory guidelines for Class III gaming?<BR>
<BR> There may be situations where the State will willingly waive its immunity
from suit in order to obtain, through negotiations, accommodations from the
applying tribe or nation. In such cases, great care must be taken to guarantee a
valid waiver and to minimize and neutralize third party legal challenges to the
process.<BR>
<BR> If, however, the State stands on its constitutionally guaranteed immunity,
what mechanism is available to the tribe?<BR>
<BR> The Eleventh Circuit answered that question in its decision below as
follows:<BR>
<BR> &quot;The answer, gleaned from the statute, is simple. One hundred and
eighty days after the tribe first requests negotiations with the state, the
tribe may file suit in the District Court. If the State pleads an Eleventh
Amendment defense, the suit is dismissed, and the tribe, pursuant to 25 U.S.C.
2710(d)(7)(B)(vii), then may notify the Secretary of the Interior of the tribe's
failure to negotiate a compact with the State. The Secretary then may prescribe
regulations governing Class III gaming on the tribe's lands. This solution
conforms with IGRA and serves to achieve Congress' goals, as delineated in
Section 2701-02.&quot;<BR>
<BR> However, when the U.S. Supreme Court considered the decision of the
Eleventh Circuit, they did not specifically adopt the above language. Instead,
the Court in what at first glance almost appears to be an afterthought, included
as a footnote at the end of the majority decision, said.<BR>
<BR> &quot;FN18 We do not here consider, and express no opinion upon, that
portion of the decision below that provides a substitute remedy for a tribe
bringing suit...&quot;<BR>
<BR> Did the Court ignore the question of a substitute remedy because the
majority was not unanimous on that question? If so, perhaps the answer will come
in a separate decision.<BR>
<BR> Presently pending before the Court is a cross-petition filed by the State
of Florida which seeks to have the U.S. Supreme Court specifically overrule the
Eleventh Circuits' outline of an alternative procedures.<BR>
<BR> That petition is pending at this writing. Perhaps the Court will respond
to that petition, or by denying it, leave in place the Eleventh Circuit
position.<BR>
<BR> It is also possible that the Court decided to leave the resolution of the
question of alternative procedures for Congress to resolve through amending
legislation. It is a long standing tradition of the Court not to provide answers
unless compelled to do so by the central issue of the case, and the present
Court seems sensitive to the philosophy of separation of powers.<BR>
<BR> Until either the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress speaks on this issue, the
law within the Eleventh Circuit will be as announced and tribes who have been
unable to negotiate compacts may act accordingly.<BR>
<BR> Whether a tribe now has a compact in place, is presently negotiating a
contract, is in the Court attempting to resist legislative attempts to overturn
a compact negotiated with a governor, or is about to otherwise seek to pursue
Class III gaming, a whole new series of questions, including those relating to
waiver, State Court jurisdiction, Justice Department enforcement procedures and
standing of third parties to challenge existing compacts are now upon us.<BR>

created by Seminole case. If you have questions concerning the status and
development of the law and how it affects you, please call at my Atlantic City
