<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Frequently Asked Questions</STRONG></FONT><P>

<STRONG>What is an IRA?</STRONG><BR>
An IRA provides you with an option to invest up to $2,000 or 100% of your earned income,
whichever is less, in your IRA each year. You can have an IRA whether or not you are an
active participant in any other retirement plan. However, you may not be able to deduct all
of your contributions if you or your spouse are covered by an employer retirement plan.<P>

<STRONG>What is a Rollover IRA?</STRONG><BR>
Participants entitled to a qualified lump sum distribution from their employer's retirement
plan can rollover their distribution to an IRA, thereby eliminating the mandatory 20% tax
withholding requirement. This move from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to an IRA can
be accomplished through a direct rollover IRA.  The various rules regarding rollover IRAs are
discussed in the Custodial
Agreement and the Disclosure Statement.  You can request a New York Life Rollover IRA Program Kit. 
Click on the "What's My Next Step?" link below.<P>

<STRONG>What is the minimum initial investment required to open a Rollover
IRA?</STRONG><BR>
The total minimum initial investment is $1,000.<P>

<STRONG>Can I receive periodic distributions from my IRA?</STRONG><BR>
Yes, you can request monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual payments from your account.
These payments will be subject to ordinary income taxes and if you're under 59 1/2, you may
be subject to an IRS-imposed 10% penalty tax. The funds remaining in your IRA continue to be
tax deferred until withdrawn or distributed.<P>

<STRONG>Will I receive written confirmation?</STRONG><BR>
Yes. Each time you make an investment or an exchange, a confirmation will be sent to you.<P>

<STRONG>Will I receive statements and how frequently?</STRONG><BR>
Each month we will send you a consolidated statement that shows the total value of
your account, the holdings in your account, and the activity in the account during the
month.<P>

<STRONG>What tax information is furnished to the IRS with respect to my IRA?</STRONG><BR>
Each year during tax reporting season these forms will be filed with the IRS and a copy will
be sent to you.<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Form 5498 shows regular and rollover contributions and the value of your account at year
end.
	<LI>Form 1099R shows all amounts paid to you during the year from your IRA.<P>
</UL>

<STRONG>What happens if I withdraw funds from my IRA?</STRONG><BR>
You may, of course, take a distribution from your IRA at any time. However, if this is done
before age 59 1/2 (and you are not disabled), you will have taken what is called a "premature
distribution" and you may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. After age 59 1/2, you can withdraw
all or part of your IRA assets without penalty. Of course, these withdrawals will be taxed as
ordinary income.<P>

<STRONG>At what age must I withdraw from my IRA, and how much should I
withdraw?</STRONG><BR>
According to IRS requirements, you have to begin withdrawing money from your IRA by April 1
of the year following the year in which you turn age 70 1/2. All subsequent required
distributions must be taken annually by December 31.<P>
The minimum required withdrawal is based on two factors: the previous year-end balance of
your IRA, and your life expectancy or the life expectancy of you and your designated
beneficiary. However, if you elect a beneficiary who is not your spouse, for calculation
purposes, your primary beneficiary will not be considered to be more than 10 years younger
than you.<P>
Life expectancies are initially determined using standard IRS tables. All subsequent years
may be determined using two different methods; straight-line or recalculation. Once you
choose your method of calculation, your election becomes irrevocable.<P>

<STRONG>What withdrawal options do I have?</STRONG><BR>
Your distribution can be paid to you either as a lump sum or, using the systematic withdrawal
option, we can send you a check monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually.
Required Minimum Distributions may be rolled over into a regular non-IRA brokerage account in
your name. Please note that funds will be taxed under this option and any growth in this
account is no longer tax deferred.<P>

<STRONG>What happens if I die before receiving the money in my IRA?</STRONG><BR>
If you die before withdrawing any or all of your assets from your IRA, the remaining amount
will be distributed to your designated beneficiary(ies). If you have not designated a
beneficiary, or a beneficiary dies before you, your beneficiary will be your estate.<P>
