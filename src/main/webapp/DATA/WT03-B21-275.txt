The 
United 
States 
is 
relatively 
well 
endowed 
with 
water. 
Annual
precipitation 
averages 
nearly 
30 inches 
or 
4,200 
billion 
gallons per day
(bgd) throughout the conterminous forty-eight states .

Two-thirds of the precipitation is quickly evaporated and transpired back
to the atmosphere; the remaining one-third flows into the nation's lakes,
rivers, groundwater reservoirs, and eventually to the ocean .
These flows provide a potential renewable supply of 1,400 bgd, which is
nearly fifteen times current daily consumptive use -- the quantity of water
withdrawn from but not returned to a usable water source. Moreover, much
larger quantities of freshwater are stored in the nation's surface and
groundwater reservoirs. Reservoirs behind dams can store about 280,000
billion gallons (about 860 million acre- feet), even larger quantities are
stored in lakes, and water stored in aquifers (subterranean bodies of
unconsolidated materials such as sand, gravel, and soil that are saturated
with water and sufficiently permeable to produce water in useful
quantities) within 2,500 feet of the earth's surface is at least 100 times
the reservoir capacity. These stocks are equivalent to more than fifty
years renewable supply.

The United States has invested large sums of private and public money to
adapt to the vicissitudes of the hydrologic cycle. A vast infrastructure of
dams, reservoirs, canals, pumps, and levees has been constructed over the
years to collect, control, and contain surplus flows and to distribute
water on demand during low as well as high flow periods. As a result, most
water users take for granted that virtually unlimited quantities of
freshwater will be available at the turn of a tap. Moreover, the nation's
water use patterns have come to reflect a disregard for the limits of
natural hydrological conditions; the highest levels of use and the lowest
prices are often found in the more arid areas of the country. But, as
droughts and floods frequently remind us, water often is not where we want
it, when we want it.

More than 75,000 dams and reservoirs with a storage capacity of about 860
million acre-feet help convert the United States' naturally varying water
resources into more reliable and controlled supplies. Even though currently
developed storage represents only about 70 percent of the potential
reservoir capacity, dam construction has slowed to a trickle in recent
years. Moreover, future increases in assured water supplies for municipal,
industrial, and irrigation use through the addition of surface reservoir
capacity are likely to be modest for several reasons.

First, sedimentation is reducing existing reservoir capacity each year by
about 1.5 million acre-feet (maf). Second, sizable investments are required
to rehabilitate, maintain, and in some cases, remove dams. A 1992 national
dam inventory classified almost a third of all dams in the United States as
hazardous: more than 10,000 dams as having a high hazard potential and
another 13,500 with a significant hazard potential. The consequences of a
dam failure can be catastrophic. In 1972, 125 people died and more than
3,000 were left homeless when Beaver Creek Dam in West Virginia failed. In
1977, 14 were killed and more than $1 billion in damages resulted from the
failure of Teton Dam in Idaho, and 39 were killed when Kelly Barnes Dam in
Georgia failed.

<DD>Third, the best sites for storing water are the first to be developed
within a river basin. Consequently, subsequent increases in storage
generally require an ever larger investment. A study of decadal changes in
reservoir storage capacity per unit volume of dam for the 100 largest dams
in the United States suggests that sharply diminishing returns are already
the case: the average reservoir capacity produced per cubic yard of dam
declined 35-fold between the 1920s and 1960s.

<DD>Fourth, there are diminishing returns in the "safe yield" produced by
successive increases in reservoir capacity within a river basin. At some
point the increase in evaporation losses due to increased reservoir surface
area can more than offset any gains in safe yield associated with
additional surface storage. A study of U.S. river basins suggests that safe
yield reaches a maximum when the ratio of storage to average annual
renewable supply is in the range of 1.6 to 4.6. By this criterion the point
of negative returns may have already been reached in three major basins --
the Lower Colorado, the Upper Colorado, and the Rio Grande, where the
ratios of storage to average renewable supply are now within this range.

<DD>The fifth, and perhaps most important, reason for the inevitability of
rising water costs is that the remaining opportunities for adding storage
are now far more restricted by environmental concerns: the environmental
costs of storing and diverting water increase as the number of free-flowing
streams declines and as society attaches more value to water left in a
stream. To the extent that water projects control flooding and capture
water that otherwise would be lost to human use as a result of evaporation
or runoff to the oceans or other unusable sinks, such facilities increase
usable freshwater supplies. However, as water development expands and the
resource becomes increasingly scarce (that is, when using water for one use
adversely affects its availability for other uses), construction of another
dam and reservoir on a river may add little, if anything, to the overall
supply. Rather, the project may only provide a means of allocating supplies
among alternative uses, usually from instream uses such as fish and
wildlife habitat and recreation to withdrawal uses such as irrigation or
domestic supplies. Examples are found in basins where the flows are already
highly controlled and intensively used, such as the Colorado River Basin.
The value of the water that is taken from instream uses (such as
hydroelectric power generation and habitat for fish and wildlife) when more
water is withdrawn becomes an important factor in the economic costs (both
financial and environmental) of augmenting a region's effective supply of
water for domestic, industrial, or agricultural use.

Public resistance to the high financial and environmental costs associated
with the traditional means of augmenting water supplies has forced
suppliers to consider a number of alternative approaches to increasing
reliable supplies such as recycling wastewater, desalination, and more
exotic schemes.

<DD>INSTITUTIONAL SHORTCOMINGS

<DD>The opportunities as well as the incentives to use, abuse, conserve, or
protect water supplies are the result of many fragmented local, state, and
federal water institutions. These institutions determine how tradeoffs
among alternative water uses are made and whether high- quality water is
likely to be available for drinking, new development opportunities,
water-based recreation, or fish and wildlife habitat. Water adequacy would
be less of a concern were these institutions more effectively interlinked
and more capable of efficiently protecting the quality of drinking supplies
and valued aquatic ecosystems and of allocating scarce supplies to higher
value uses in response to changing supply and demand conditions.

<DD>High rates of water withdrawals are a legacy of past laws and policies that
historically favored offstream over instream uses. During the first
two-thirds of this century water policy was dominated by the view that it
is wasteful to leave resources unused that are capable of producing crops,
power, or other products. Water was free for the taking, and most users
enjoyed virtually unlimited supplies at low cost during all but the most
extreme droughts. But the environmental costs of ignoring the impacts on
instream flows were high; thousands of miles of once free-flowing streams
were lost and the quality of many streams and lakes deteriorated such that
they were unusable for most purposes. The engineering and diversion of the
nation's rivers contributed to the sharp decline in the nation's wetlands,
which store floodwater, control erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat,
improve water quality, and furnish recreational opportunities.

<DD>During the last quarter century, the policy focus has shifted almost 180o
toward protecting remaining flows and recovering some of the environmental
and recreational benefits that were sacrificed in the drive to provide
homes, factories, and farms with inexpensive water. This shift is evident
in a number of legislative acts. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968
precludes development activities that might significantly alter an area's
natural amenities on thousands of miles of rivers and streams. The National
Environmental Policy Act of 1970 requires all federal agencies to give full
consideration to environmental effects in planning their programs. The
Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 (commonly known as the
Clean Water Act) together with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and
other legislation regulating the use and cleanup of toxic materials have
made water quality rather than water supply the driving force behind the
nation's water-related investments. The expenditure of more than $500
billion on water pollution control since 1972 has produced major
improvements in the quality of U.S. surface water resources in the face of
increasing population and economic pressures.

<DD>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 has come to dominate water
management and investment decisions in the Pacific Northwest. Since 1982
the Northwest Power Planning Council has supervised the expenditure of more
than $1.7 billion for measures to rebuild salmon stocks. Despite these
costly efforts, three stocks of salmon that spawn in the Snake River are
listed as threatened or endangered, petitions have been filed for listing
several other stocks, and as many as eighty-five salmon stocks throughout
the Columbia River basin are so weakened that they could be granted
protection under the ESA.

<DD>The ESA could have a similar impact on water management in California where
the Delta smelt, whose prime habitat is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
has been granted protection. Protecting the habitat of the smelt or other
Delta species that are under consideration for protection would limit the
ability to export water from the Delta to the millions of people in central
and southern California who depend on its supply for domestic, industrial,
and agricultural uses. The ESA has been invoked to alter water investment
and management decisions in other areas, including putting a hold on the
$590 million Animas-La Plata project in the Colorado River Basin.

<DD>The Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 (ECPA), which requires the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to give power and non-power benefits
equal consideration in its licensing and relicensing decisions, has made
hydropower relicensing another battleground in the struggle over
alternative water uses. The United States has more than 2,300 hydroelectric
power plants with a total capacity of 73,500 megawatts; annual production
in 1993 of 265 billion kilowatt hours accounted for about 9% of U.S.
electrical power generation. Most of these plants operate under federal
licenses that were issued as many as fifty years ago, when fewer questions
were raised about the effects of hydropower on fish and wildlife habitat.
As the licenses expire, the utilities are faced with a complex, costly, and
time-consuming relicensing process under ECPA that is likely to require a
detailed environmental assessment of a plant's impacts on fish and wildlife
habitat, water quality, recreation, land use, local communities, and
cultural resources. If a new license is eventually granted, it is apt to be
encumbered with restrictions that diminish the value of the plant's power
output.
