<H2>Australia</H2>
The engineering sector contributes around 2.5% of national GDP of which 40% is from basic metal products (excluding aluminium), 40% is from fabricated metals and 20% from industrial machinery and equipment.
<P>
Exports of metal products and equipment have increased strongly over recent years to reach $4.7 billion.  Exports of engineering services by Australian companies have increased to $200 million.
<P>
R&D spending by the engineering sector (including basic non-ferrous metals) in 1992/93 was $410 million.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
The manufacturing part of the engineering sector has turnover in excess of $8 billion and employs 48,000 people in Victoria, with 34,000 of these in basic engineering, mainly in fabricated metal products, and 14,000 employed in industrial machinery and equipment.  Engineering services employs around 5,000.  Victoria has around 20% of national iron and steel production, compared with 30% of national fabricated metals production and 34% of industrial machinery and equipment.
<P>
The tendency for local firms to be smaller and less specialised than those overseas offers some advantages.  Victorian firms are increasingly competitive in short production runs for specialised machinery.  They can use this experience to exploit a market niche for short run production.
<P>
Victoria has well developed engineering skills in areas such as automotive tooling and the production of special purpose machinery.  Victoria's cost competitive automotive tooling sector is becoming increasingly export conscious.
<P>
Engineering exports from Victoria are around $1.3 billion, the main products including steel, metal products and machinery. Rapid economic development in Asia will provide export opportunities for Victoria's consulting engineers and for local engineering companies as suppliers or collaborative partners.
<P>
R&D spending by the engineering sector in Victoria in 1992/93 was $115 million or 28% of the Australian total.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected equipment production to grow by 5 % through to 2005/6, metal products to also grow at 5 % compared with only 1 % for steel production.
<P>
Investment opportunities are available for the engineering sector to provide production equipment and tooling, ancillary equipment to major equipment manufacturers overseas, general process equipment and refurbishing and engineering services.
<P>
The sectors most likely to require these inputs are automotive, processed food, TCF, CPR, waste management and forest products.  <P>
