<P>Toronto, Ontario, January 9, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc announces today that a fatality was sustained at its Deep Development project at the Casa Berardi Mine.

<P>Olivier-Levi Gauvin, 52, a miner with 30 years experience was fatally injured at Les Mines Casa Berardi, at 6:15AM, Saturday, January 7, 1995.  Mr. Gauvin is survived by his spouse Lucille Whynott Plourde.

<P>Mr. Gauvin, a former mining supervisor and instructor, was fatally injured during an underground safety inspection at a drift face in the Deep Development project of the mine.  It was determined by the Company's investigation, performed in conjunction with Worker Health & Safety representative of the Joint Occupation Health Committee, that Mr. Gauvin was struck by a second piece of loose that was released as he was scaling a primary target of loose.  The accident was witnessed by a fellow miner who is also experienced in this job function.  All proper authorities were contacted immediately after the accident and have visited the site.  Pending completion of normal investigations, the Company temporarily suspended all work in this heading of the Development project.  Regular mining operations at Casa Berardi were not affected and continue normally.
