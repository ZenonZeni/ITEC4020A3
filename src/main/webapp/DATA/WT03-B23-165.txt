<P>
Stocks have their share of risks just like
any other investment except they are more visible. There isn't
a day that the market is open that an investor can't find out
how stocks performed for the day. It's not the price of the Treasury's
30-year bond, the price of a commercial office tower in Boston
or the price of your house that people want to hear about --
it's the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average always
gets its daily dues on the evening news because millions of people
are interested in the stock market.
 
<P>
Although the daily changes in stock prices may seem to have no explanation to a novice investor, they are the result of a number of risks:

<UL>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="econ">Economic</A></B> ---
the strength of the economy will influence whether or not a company
and the market will be able to meet investors' earnings expectations.
However, each industry and type of stock will be affected differently.
Growth stocks and cyclical stocks will rise with an expanding
economy and fall as times get tough.  Defensive issues like
food, beverage and drug companies, on the other hand, will have a tendency to outperform
other stocks during periods of economic slowdown or uncertainty.</LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="interest">Interest Rate</A></B>
--- higher rates affect stocks in
several ways. First, higher rates will cause borrowing costs to
go up, thus making it more difficult for companies to grow and
increase their profits. Second, higher rates also mean that money
will be attracted away from the stock market and into other investments,
such as bonds, which many investors will perceive as safer. Lower
rates will have the opposite effect.</LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="market">Market</A></B>
 --- ever notice that when
the stock market rallies, most stocks post gains and when the
market falls off sharply, most stocks will decline. This fluctuation is known
as market risk. A change in &quot;market psychology&quot; can
cause a stock or the market  to decline regardless of any fundamental
change in the company's earnings outlook.</LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="business">Business</A></B>
 --- these are the risks that are
company specific. What's the competition and how are they doing?
How is management doing? What's the outlook for the company next
year? All of these factors will determine if the stock will attract
buyers or sellers.</LI>

a financially healthy company. It's very difficult for a company
to grow if it is burdened by an unreasonable amount of debt and
the company's financial health is deteriorating.</LI>
