<p> The fiscal costs of California marijuana law enforcement
began to escalate dramatically in the mid- 1960's as mainly
young, White, middle-class marijuana offenders flooded the
criminal justice system, replacing older, nonWhite heroin addicts
as the typical drug offenders in the state (Aldrich, Mikuriya
&amp; Brownell 1986: 2-9). California marijuana arrests leaped
tenfold from 1962 (3,743) to 1967 (37,514), with corresponding
increases in the number and cost of court dispositions,
incarcerations in county jails and state prisons, and probation
and parole caseloads. As shown in Table I, by 1972 there were
approximately 76,561 marijuana-related arrests, of which 73,061
were felony arrests, mostly for possession offenses. By 1974
there were nearly 100,000 felony marijuana-related arrests, and
these comprised one quarter of all the felony arrests in the
state (Aldrich, Mikuriya &amp; Brownell 1986). </p>

<p> The steep increase in the number of arrests, the change in
drug-offender characteristics, and the felony status of marijuana
possession offenses led legislators to adopt several different
strategies to cope with the burden on the criminal justice
system. These included the so-called wobbler bills of 1968 and
1969, which allowed first offense felony marijuana possession
cases to be disposed of as misdemeanors, and since 1972, a
diversion program that has allowed charges to be dropped against
first offenders if they complete a drug abuse treatment program
(Brownell 1988). Nevertheless, the cost of marijuana law
enforcement continued to explode, from approximately eight
million dollars in 1960 to over $100 million a year in 1972
(California Senate Select Committee 1974: 97-118). </p>

<p> The crux of the problem faced by legislators was that
possession of marijuana was a felony offense. In terms of law
enforcement time, personnel. and budgets, a felony offense
receives top priority. It frequently involves the following:
investigation by more than one officer; transporting, booking,
and incarcerating the offender; hours of paperwork; and time
spent in court by the arresting officers. In addition, a felony
drug offense often involves the use of paid informants, gathering
evidence and reliable witnesses, a budget for drug purchases,
undercover work, and interagency cooperation. Even under the
wobbler provisions of Penal Code Section 17, a felony charge
required adjudication in a lower court or Superior Court,
investigation of the defendant's prior criminal record, and some
expenditure of public funds at every level of the criminal
justice system. This may include the cost of grand juries, public
defenders, prosecutors, judges, bailiffs, juries, hearings,
trials, appeals, county jails, state prisons, and/or probation
and parole systems, depending on how each case proceeds (Aldrich,
Mikuriya &amp; Brownell 1986; Calof 1968). </p>

<p> On the other hand, a misdemeanor offense generally requires
less expenditure of time and money by law enforcement agencies,
can often be adjudicated in the lower courts, and punishes the
convicted offender with a fine, probation or a year or less in
county jail rather than a year or more in state prison. A
citation offense, which involves giving the offender a ticket
with a fixed bail that can be forfeited as a fine, is the least
expensive offense category because it can be disposed of with a
minimum of police </p>

<p> *Data provided by Bureau of Criminal Statistics and Special
Services, California Department of Justice. Misdemeanor marijuana
arrest figures were not recorded by the Bureau between 1972
through 1977, and am estimated based an the averages of the three
preceding years and the two following years. al. 19 87). </p>

<p> It was this reality-based observation of the criminal justice
system that Senator George Moscone, then Majority Leader of the
State Senate, recognized when designing California's unique
misdemeanor citation system for possession of marijuana in small
amounts (Brownell 1988; Aldrich et al. 1987; Atkeson 1987; Budman
1977; Uelman 1976; Moscone 1974); and it is this reality that is
recognized in the present article in-estimating the savings
attributable to that law. At present (under the Moscone Act),
almost all misdemeanor marijuana offenses are citable, and are
valued in this article at one third the cost of felony marijuana
arrests. </p>

<h2>METHODS</h2>

<p> The methods utilized are presented in detail, with annual
tables and formulas used for calculations, by Aldrich and
colleagues (1987) and Aldrich, Mikuriya and Brownell (1986).
California marijuana arrest data from 1960 through 1985, and
court dispositions and law enforcement expenditures from 1972
through 1985 were obtained from the Bureau of Criminal Statistics
and Special Services of the California Department of Justice. </p>

<p> Marijuana arrest expenditures were calculated according to a
method designed by Post, a former legislative analyst (California
Senate Select Committee 1974: 99) who determined that
approximately one quarter of police time is devoted to the
detection and apprehension of criminals, and therefore that
arrest expenditures are approximately one quarter of all law
enforcement expenditures. Weighting felony arrests at dime times
as expensive as misdemeanor arrests, the average cost per felony
was determined by dividing total arrest expenditures by the
number of felony arrests plus one third of the number of
misdemeanor arrests. Felony marijuana arrest expenditures from
1972 through 1985 were then calculated by multiplying the number
of felony marijuana arrests by the cost per felony arrest for
each year. The average cost per misdemeanor arrest was obtained
by dividing the cost per felony arrest by three, and misdemeanor
marijuana arrest expenditures were calculated by multiplying the
number of marijuana arrests by the cost per misdemeanor arrest
for each year. Total marijuana arrest expenditures for each year
were obtained by adding felony and misdemeanor marijuana arrest
expenditures (Aldrich et al. 1987). </p>

<p> The method used to calculate the cost of marijuana
court-disposition relies on a time-weighting technique used by
the Judicial Council of California (1985: 112ff) to determine the
number of judgeships needed in the state. This technique
recognizes the wide variance in judicial time needed to dispose
of different types of cases, and gives a much more accurate
picture of court costs than would be obtained using raw numbers
of dispositions. In 1984, for instance, criminal case
dispositions were 10 percent of the total dispositions filed in
Superior Court, but took up 33 percent of Superior Court time.
For comparison, juvenile delinquency cases were also 10 percent
of Superior Court dispositions, but took up only seven percent of
its time (Judicial Council of California 1985: 114). Using
timeweights and budgets published annually by the Judicial
Council, the costs, of adult felony marijuana cases were
calculated by ascertaining the costs of criminal cases in the
lower courts and Superior Courts, along with court-related costs
in each, for each year from 1972 through 1985, and then
multiplying the result by the percentage of those cases that
involved marijuana. </p>

<p> Annual prison and parole population counts and expenditures
were obtained from the California Department of Corrections,
dividing the latter by the former to determine per capita costs.
These costs were then multiplied by the number of prisoners and
parolees whose most serious convicted offense was a marijuana
charge (also provided by the Department of Corrections) to
determine the cost of marijuana-related prison and parole for
each year from 1974 through 1985. </p>

<p> The State and Local Government Implicit Price Deflation a
federal index available from the Commission on State Finance that
is frequently employed by state agencies for budget analysis, was
used to adjust marijuana law enforcement expenditures for
inflation. Savings attributable to the Moscone Act (expressed in
1986 dollars) were calculated by subtracting the
inflation-adjusted arrest, disposition, prison and parole
expenditures for each year after the law took effect (January 1,
1976) from a baseline average of these expenditures in the two
years (1974 and 1975) immediately before the law took effect. </p>

<h2>RESULTS</h2>

<p> As shown in Table I and Figure 1, the major ongoing effect.
of the Moscone Act has been to reduce felony marijuana arrests
from 92,677 a year (the average for 1974 and 1975) to 20,068 a
year (the average for 1976 through 1985). Thus the new law saved
California the expenses of 72,609 felony arrests every year for a
decade, a 78 percent decrease in felony marijuana arrest
expenditures. </p>

<p> At the same time, making possession a citable misdemeanor
caused a tenfold increase in misdemeanor marijuana arrests: from
an average of 3,500 per year for 1974 and 1975 to an, average of
39,113 per year from 1976 through 1985-an average increase of
35,613. However, these misdemeanor citations were not nearly as
expensive to issue or to adjudicate. The cumulative effect was to
cut total marijuana-related arrests by 39 percent over the
decade: from an average of 96,177 for 1974 and 1975 to an average
of 59,128 from 1976 through 1985-an average decrease of 37,049
marijuana arrests per year. </p>

<p> The massive reduction in felony arrests, in tandem with a
more modest increase in misdemeanor arrests, produced an
extraordinary drop in statewide law enforcement expenditures
since 1976, as shown in Table IL Total expenditures (in 1986
dollars) on marijuana arrests, court dispositions, prisoners and
parolees dropped from an average of $157.6 million for 1974 and
1975 to an average of $61.8 million per year during the following
decade. </p>

<p> As shown in Table 111, the State of California has saved
nearly half a billion dollars ($464,552,353 or $46 million below
100 in 1980. This resulted in considerable savings in prison and
parole expenditures (see Table II), which totaled more than $52
million since 1976 (see Table HD. </p>

<h2>SUMMARY, DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h2>

<p> The State of California has saved a minimum of one billion
dollars since 1976 as a result of making possession of an ounce
or less of marijuana a citable misdemeanor instead of a felony.
The present study considered savings from 1976 through 1985 in
four major areas: arrest costs, court costs, prison costs and
parole costs. Together they amounted to a total savings of $958
million, or nearly $ 100 million per year (see Table III). When
these savings are compared with the $100 million a year being
spent on marijuana law enforcement in 1971 and 1972 (California
Senate Select Committee 1974: 118) and the average of $157.6
million spent in 1974 and 1975 (see Table 11), it is evident that
the Moscone Act has been quite successful in achieving two of its
main objectives: (1) reducing law enforcement expenditures
related to possession of small amounts of marijuana to a minimum;
and (2) relieving an overwhelming burden on the state judicial
system. </p>

<p> One billion dollars should be considered a minimum estimate
of savings because the present study did not include savings in
the cost of county jails, prosecutors, public defenders,
probation departments, misdemeanor court dispositions, juvenile
facilities, or peripheral parts of the criminal justice system
involved with marijuana law enforcement, such as the cost of
collecting statistics. Nor were any savings in expenditures by
individual arrestees or defendants considered. Savings are also
underestimated because the total amount of fines paid for
marijuana misdemeanor citations is not recorded. If all of the
40,671 people cited for possession of an ounce or less of
marijuana in 1985 (Aldrich et al. 1987: 1) paid a $100 fine, that
revenue amounts to more than four million dollars per year. </p>

<p> When the Moscone Act was being debated in the California
Legislature in 1974, some opponents of the bill were concerned
that reducing penalties for possession for an ounce or less of
marijuana to a maximum $100 fine would be a &quot;green
light&quot; for drug users across the state (Budman 1977).
Senator Moscone pointed out that a 1974 study of marijuana use in
Oregon, which had passed a similar statute in 1973, had found no
increase in statewide use of the drug, while 40 percent of the
marijuana smokers surveyed reported a decrease in their use
(California Senate Select Committee: 6-7). A follow-up survey in
Oregon in 1976 (Drug Abuse Council 1977) showed only a very
slight (three percent) increase in the number currently using
marijuana, and also reported that fear of prosecution </p>

<h2>ENFORCEMENT COSTS</h2>

<p> mum $100 fine) of these offenses with alternative fine/jail/
prison penalties would obliterate the citation system and all the
savings brought about by using this system. Either of these
legislative changes would at least triple, and more likely
quadruple, statewide marijuana law enforcement and criminal
justice system expenditures in every future year (Aldrich et al.
1987). </p>

<p> It is rare that taxpayers can congratulate lawmakers for
saving a considerable amount of money in any area of law
enforcement The present system is accomplishing the purposes for
which it was designed by Senator Moscone, by keeping possession
of small amounts of marijuana a criminal offense while
significantly reducing the criminal justice expenditures related
to that offense. </p>
