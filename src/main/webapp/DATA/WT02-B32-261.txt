Infopreneur relies on NewsNet to <BR>
keep clients current on marketing trends</H2><BR CLEAR=ALL>

Currency of information is NewsNet's strongest attribute.And, the more current the information an online service can provide, the more valuable it is.For Amelia Kassel, owner and co-founder of MarketingBase, a California information brokerage, it is precisely this currency and speed of retrieval that keeps her coming back to NewsNet.<P>

When Amelia needs quick delivery of information to her clients, she turns to NewsNet.<P>

But its not just the currency of information Amelia finds useful.It is also the depth of the archived data that makes NewsNet an excellent service for retrospective searching."Of all the available systems," she said, "NewsNet's information goes back the furthest for many newsletters.I frequently access Telecommunications Reports and Telecommunications Reports International on NewsNet because I know it has the most current and the most historical telecommunications information."<P>

Requests for marketing information, trends within specific industries, company background information and market analysis remain the primary focus for the majority of MarketingBase clients.Amelia finds information her clients need by turning to NewsNet's industry-specific newsletters.<P>

Amelia especially likes the headline searching feature of NewsNet.Viewing headlines after a search accelerates the article-selection process and enables her to get information into her clients hands even faster.<P>

NewsFlash is another great feature important to Amelia.According to her, there is a growing trend for an alert service such as NewsFlash.She feels that clipping services like NewsFlash have a lot of potential for growth among business executives who need to keep up to date on industry news.<P>
