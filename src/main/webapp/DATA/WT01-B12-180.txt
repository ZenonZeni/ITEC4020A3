Career change. Health concerns. Money issues in a relationship.
<P>
Chances are that either you or someone you know is experiencing
one or more of these issues in everyday life. If so, you may benefit
from viewing one of the new self-help videotapes produced by WETA
in Washington, D.C., in conjunction with the new public television
series &quot;In the Prime.&quot; &quot;In the Prime,&quot; a 26-part
television series dealing with issues and topics for people who
are in the prime of their life, was underwritten by Kemper Funds
Group. 
<P>
<I>Couples and Money</I> Psychotherapist Olivia Mellan is a ground-breaker
in the field of money psychology and conflict resolution. Mellan
explains what makes people irrational about money and identifies
money myths, money personalities and the dynamics of couples and
money.
<P>
<I>The Mind-Body Connection</I> James S. Gordon, M.D., a Harvard
Medical School graduate, takes an approach that emphasizes the
power of self-care through self-awareness, meditation, relaxation,
self-hypnosis, nutrition and exercise. This video shows how these
techniques and approaches -- from acupuncture to herbalism, from
meditation to massage -- improve health and treat serious illnesses.

<P>
<I>Changing Careers</I> Through a series of simple exercises,
motivational speaker, author and career specialist Carole Hyatt
helps viewers identify their own &quot;strands&quot; and explore
how to reweave them into new patterns to create their next careers.
<P>
As the national underwriter of &quot;In the Prime,&quot; Kemper
Funds Group can offer these videos at a significant discount.
When offered through normal channels, the videos sell for $24.95
each with postage and handling. But you can purchase each for
only $14.95 with postage and handling by calling (800) 498-4041.
That's a $10 savings on each video.
<P>
 &quot;In the Prime&quot; can be seen weekly throughout most of
the country on the local PBS affiliate. <A HREF="intheprime_times.html">Check local listings</A>
