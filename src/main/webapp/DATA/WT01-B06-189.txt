Knight, Nike and the Mafia</B>


</H1><P>


<P><B>Phil Knight is the godfather of the Nike Mafia. Knight started Nike

in the 1960s with a $500 investment and is now worth $4.5 billion because

of his successful, ruthless strong-arm tactics.  He has built his massive

empire on worker exploitation and child labor, coupled with massive payoffs

to superstars like Michael Jordan to pimp for his products. Nike has paid

off the U.S. Olympic Committee, major colleges and their coaches, and well-known


players and celebrities to solicit impressionable children to buy its products.


Nike bought Michael Jordan for $20 million, but its hundred-million dollar

Cosa Nostra spokesmodels include Andre Agassi, Spike Lee, Pete Sampras, Dennis


Rodman and the Dallas Cowboys. </B>


<P><B>Nike was named one of the worst ten corporations in the world by the


Multinational Monitor, but it is far worse than a bad corporate citizen.

It is corrupt and corrupting our youth and the nation. While ten-year-olds

made Nike products for peanuts in the Third World, teenagers in this country

are shooting each other for their Nike shoes.</B>


<P><B>The Nike Mafia operates primarily in those countries that tolerate

worker exploitation and bribery, including South Korea, Indonesia, Pakistan,


China, and Vietnam. The Progressive said "Labor in Indonesia is cheap, after

all- so cheap that it costs an employer less to hire uniformed goons to rough

up would-be labor activists than to negotiate."  When labor got too expensive

in Korea, Nike picked up and left, continuing to use its Korean thugs to

run operations in Indonesia. This allows Nike to deny hiring child labor

and operating sweat shops by saying, "We just don't do it- the Koreans own

the plant."</B>


<P><B>Even Nike apologist Donald Katz, who wrote a puff piece on the company


called "Just Do It" explained the Nike system:  "Management by terror and


browbeating led to strikes by  Indonesian workers who were fed up with former


South Korean Tiger Division types yelling at them. It was suggested that

some of the authoritarian managers from Pussan might have been acting out


frustrations with Korean line workers whose demands for better pay were chasing


the domestic shoe scene away. 'They yell at us when we don't make the production


quotas and if we talk back they cut our wages,' one female line worker at

an Indonesian factory making Nikes told a reporter for the Far Eastern Economic


Review."  Sweltering in 90 degree heat, a young female worker named Eni dabs


paint on the soles of freshly moulded shoes. Presses thump at a deafening

pace while glue and rubber burns young lungs. But the Nike advertisement

posted on the wall next to her admonishes, "Just Do It."  Eni said, "If we

made a mistake, they call us dogs and prostitutes and sometimes they hit

us." </B>


<P><B>Workers in Indonesia have protested the abominable working conditions,


exhausting overtime, and child labor. When they complain, Nike's henchman

have the workers fired. Of course these practices are illegal in the United


States, but Nike does little production work where workers have rights. Even

in Indonesia, Nike has lost a court case when it fired protesting workers.

One major case against Nike's lieutenants is now before the Indonesian Supreme


Court.</B>


<P><B>The Nike College mafia is corrupting our universities and students.

Nike buys college coaches, like Georgetown's John Thompson, who requires

his amateur players to wear Nike shoes.  Other colleges have done the same,


shilling for Nike, intoxicating impressionable youngsters into believing

that wearing Nikes is the key to an NBA or college basketball future. The

U.S. Olympic Committee prostituted itself by selling Nike the right to call


itself an Olympic sponsor.  The &nbsp;USOC sells sponsorships to the highest


bidder, working conditions be damned. The Olympic Committee prays to the

altar of the almighty dollar without regard to where a company makes its


products.</B>


<P><B>Nike is a hollow company, much the way that the Mafia is hollow.  Neither


actually produces anything. They both use their money and muscle to take

what others have made by the sweat of their brow.  Nike has others make shoes

for it in Indonesia and elsewhere for $5.  These same shoes retail for $100

or more.  This is not unlike the Mafia buying illegal drugs and marking them

up by 2000%.  Street value for shoes bears a striking similarity to street

value for crack cocaine. For inner city kids they are the only games in


town.</B>


<P><B>A few brave souls have stood up to the Nike Mafia.   One of those is

my nominee for hero of the year:  Joseph Tam. Tam grew up in Hong Kong where

as a child he made little plastic flowers and plastic Christmas trees in

a sweatshop. Now Tam is a member of the Portland, Oregon School Board. When

he learned that Nike was using six-year old Pakistani children to stitch

soccer balls for six cents an hour, he told Nike that he didn't want their


$500,000 contribution. "I asked myself," he said, "Nike contributed this

money so my children can have a better education, but at whose expense? At

the expense of children who work for six cents an hour? Children were beaten

and branded. One child only wanted to see his mother." </B>


<P><B>Nike, in order to counter the bad press it is getting for using sweatshops


and child labor, set up a phoney organization called PLAY: Participate in

the Lives of American Youth.  The only way Nike participates in the lives

of American youth is buying millions of dollars in ads targeted to children

to buy their overpriced, overrated sneakers.  </B>


<P><B>Nike will keep doing it to us until we do it to them.  The only way

to do it to Nike is to Just Say No.  Like Joseph Tam did.  Don't take dirty

money from Nike and don't buy their products.</B>
