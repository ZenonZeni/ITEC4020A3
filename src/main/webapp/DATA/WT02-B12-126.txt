Over the past several months a debate has been raging here about the Clipper
Chip. It has been marked by name-calling, incivility, the mocking of
rational arguments when writers were unable to respond, and much barnyard
behavior in general. Through it all I've been making a number of arguments,
and presenting a number of hypotheses based on simple logic and common
sense. Having no access to "inside" information, I've had to rely on that
approach, which is based on the simple notion that my teachers had something
worthwhile to impart to me during my student days. <p>

Now the NSA has spoken out officially. In The Wall Street Journal of March
22, 1994, on page B1 there is an interview with the Clipper Chip project
leader, Clinton Brooks of the NSA. The interview officially confirms the key
points of my advocacy. <p>

1. The original purpose of the Clipper Chip was to protect U.S. civilian
communications. The escrow is laid on top of that for law enforcement
purposes. <p>

"the NSA is consumed with the 'equities problem'--how to balance privacy
rights against the needs of law enforcement, national security, and private
industry." <p>

"began discussion about how to improve computer security without making it
impenetrable to police" <p>

2. The Clipper Chip algorithm, Capstone is algorithmically highly secure. <p>

"The team decided against using a weak encryption code. ...it had to be good
security." <p>

3. The Clipper Chip does not contain a trapdoor. <p>

"it also rejected a so-called trapdoor approach in which the computer code
would be designed so it would have a weak spot--a trapdoor--that federal
agencies could enter via computer to tap the communications. Someone else
could discover the trapdoor, they decided." <p>

4. The reason the algorithm is secret is so that others cannot use such a
strong algorithm without escrow. <p>

"It would defeat the purpose [of the project] if we gave the knowledge of
how the algorithm worked" to the public..."It was going to have to be kept
classified." "Otherwise engineers could use the algorithm to design
computer-security systems that the government's encryption keys couldn't
unlock." <p>

5. The reason for the NSA's involvement is that they're the best experts we
have and not because of some sinister secret plot. <p>

"The only reason we're involved is that we have the best
cryptomathematicians in the country." <p>

Now it's possible he's lying in his teeth. But such a hypothesis would also
require lots of people up and down the NSA, the NSA's reporting
organizations, NIST, the civilian review board, the White House, and the
President all to be lying or systematically lied to. <p>

That's far too complicated a hypothesis to be credible compared with the
simpler one that he and everyone up the line is telling the truth. There are
too many cooks in this one for a "plot" to be sustained, and the damage if
there were a plot and anyone "leaked" too great. The many people involved
are not going to stake their personal credibility and that of the President
on this one. <p>
