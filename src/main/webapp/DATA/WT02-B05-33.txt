<H3>FACT SHEET ON ADMINISTRATION ANTI-TERRORISM PROPOSALS</H3>
<BR>
July 29, 1996
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Multi-Point Wiretaps</STRONG> - These were authorized by the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act of 1986 (as amended), codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2518 (11).
 We propose harmonizing the standards for obtaining a roving microphone
and a roving electronic intercept.  Under existing law, roving microphone
interceptions require only a demonstration of probable cause that it is
&quot;impracticable&quot; to use a standard uni-point order, while roving
electronic interceptions require a demonstration of probable cause that
the subject is attempting to evade surveillance by changing telephone devices.
 This latter standard is extremely difficult to meet in the investigative
phase of a case.  By way of example, an individual switching between multiple
cellular telephones, all of which he can carry in a brief case, may be doing
so to defraud a cellular carrier rather than to evade surveillance.  Since
the burden is on the government to demonstrate probable cause, an absence
of proof means that the burden is not met.  Absent a court order, multi-point
surveillance like nonconsensual uni-point intercepts is punishable as a
crime or a civil offense and evidence gained through the illegal surveillance
is subject to suppression.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Pen Registers and Trap-and-trace devices for foreign intelligence investigations</STRONG> - Pen registers are devices which record numbers dialed on a telephone.
 Trap and trace devices record the incoming number, similar to Caller ID.
 Neither records the content of the conversation.  Both may be issued on
a representation by an attorney for the government - generally an Assistant
United States Attorney - that the information is &quot;relevant to an ongoing
criminal investigation,&quot; 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3123(a). In FISA investigations,
a full electronic intercept order, approved by the Attorney General must
be sought.  We seek to harmonize the FISA and criminal standards so that
a FISA application may be made on the same showing and representation. Under
existing law, a FISA pen register could not be authorized under the criminal
standard and the use of a pen register without a court order may result
in criminal and/or civil penalties.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Taggants</STRONG> - Congress should fund at $25 million a six-month study of
identification taggants-- microscopic particles which are identifiable and
which are designed to survive an explosion -- and thereafter permit the
Treasury Department to promulgate regulations -- subject to a 45 day review
period --which would criminalize the possession of untagged explosives,
including black powder and smokeless powder.  The 1996 Terrorism Act expressly
excludes the study and regulation of black powder.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Common Carrier and Public Accommodation Records</STRONG> - We seek authority
for the FBI to issue administrative requests - National Security Letters
- to common carriers, hotels, communications providers and storage facilities
for records in foreign counterintelligence (FCI) cases. Under existing law,
grand jury subpoenae may be issued in criminal cases, see Fed. R.Crim. P.
6(e), the Attorney General has authority which she has delegated to certain
Federal agents in narcotics cases to issue administrative subpoenae. We
seek the same authority as exists in routine criminal cases for the FBI
in FCI cases.  Under existing law, carriers need not comply with an FBI
request and there is no sanction for them not doing so.  Those who fail
to comply with a valid grand jury and/or administrative subpoena are subject
to penalties which may include criminal contempt.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Emergency Wiretap Authority</STRONG> - These are authorized in ECPA in 18 U.S.C.
Sec 2518(7) and permit the Attorney General (and Deputy) to authorize an
emergency wiretap without a court order for 48 hours in certain limited
situations involving organized crime, national security or immediate risk
of injury.  At the conclusion of the 48 hours, a standard application must
be presented to a Judge and if the  intercept order is not approved by the
judge, evidence gained during the 48-hour period cannot be used. We seek
to expand the emergency situation to those which are clearly-terrorist related
but which do not trigger one of the exceptions. An emergency order granted
outside of the specified statutory criteria would constitute an illegal
intercept and would subject the interceptor to criminal and civil penalties
and the evidence to suppression.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Terrorist Offenses as RICO Predicate</STRONG> - The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) provides severe criminal, civil and forfeiture
penalties for organizations engaged in certain conduct.  Although most serious
violations are RICO predicates, terrorist acts are not.  We propose to make
terrorism offenses RICO predicates to [sic] that investigators and prosecutors
can utilize the proven tools of the statute which include freezing assets,
lengthy sentences of imprisonment and favorable case law.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Expanded Predicates</STRONG> - ECPA limits the Federal felonies which can constitute
a sufficient predicate for an intercept order, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516(1).
 We propose that any Federal felony ought to constitute a Section 2516(1)
predicate when there is a nexus to terrorist activity.  While most crimes
which are likely predicates in terrorism cases are already listed, in the
early stages of a terrorism investigation, it is entirely possible that
the only predicate may be a relatively technical crime. By way of example,
explosives shipped to a terrorist in the United States but labeled on a
Customs declaration as &quot;medical supplies&quot; give rise to a putative
violation of Customs statues. While more serious violation may become apparent
through further investigation, investigators may only have the relatively
technical false statement violation in the first instance. Under existing
law, a court order could not issue. If an intercept were conducted, it would
be illegal and could lead to criminal and civil penalties as well as the
suppression of evidence.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Statute of Limitations On Unregistered Firearms/Explosives Devices</STRONG> -
We propose extending the statute of limitations for firearms registrations
offenses -- crimes designed to prohibit the possession of machine guns and
short-barreled firearms -- from 3 to 5 years. The five-year statute of limitations
applies to virtually all other Federal crimes, including the misuse of the
Smokey the Bear emblem.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Encryption</STRONG> - We will seek legislation to strengthen our ability to prevent
terrorists from coming into possession of the technology to encrypt their
communications and data so that they are beyond the reach of law enforcement.
 We oppose legislation that would eliminate current export barriers and
encouraging the proliferation of encryption which blocks appropriate access
to protect public safety and the national security.<BR>
