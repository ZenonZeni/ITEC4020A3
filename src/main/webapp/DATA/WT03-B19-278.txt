Echuca and District encompasses the towns of Tongala, Echuca,
Rochester and the NSW Shire of Murray.  The region's workforce
has grown by 11 per cent since 1986, making it one of the fastest
growing in Victoria.
<P>
Echuca and District is strategically located on the Murray River
just 210 km north of Melbourne and in the heart of one of the
richest and most diverse agricultural and processing areas in
Victoria.
<P>
Its manufacturing sector is expanding, with more than $85 million
worth of large plant and equipment upgrades recently completed
or committed.
<P>
The region's substantial tourism industry employs 9 per cent of the workforce.
<P>
The wholesale and retail trade sectors, employing 17 per cent
of the workforce, are also expanding.
<P>
The construction industry has been given a boost with a $12 million investment
in the Moama Bowling Club and $1 million invested in the R.S.L.
Club.  A $3.2 million Aquatic and Leisure Centre
has also been constructed.

<H2>Sustainable agriculture</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/echuca1.gif" align=right>
Agriculture is a significant industry and employs 26 per cent
of the workforce in farming and services to farms.
<P>
While dairy farming, fruit, vegetables, rice and cattle provide
the basis for much of production, the region has recently developed
a new, multi-million-dollar floriculture export industry.  This
industry has benefited from $3 million worth of onfarm and processing
investment over the past eighteen months.
<P>
The region is fast becoming recognised for its efforts in ensuring
sustainable economic and environmental development and for the
long-term future of its agriculture and related industries.
<P>
This is demonstrated by an innovative project turning salt-laden
ground water into an asset by producing high quality salt suitable
for food processing.
This project is also addressing one of the greatest threats facing
sustainable agricultural production in Victoria, by significantly
reducing the water table and returning salt-affected land to production.

<H2>A feast of attractions</H2>

<P>
Tourism in Echuca and District generates more than $100 million
