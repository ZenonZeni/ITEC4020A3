<H4><a name="3.11">Enhancing the Effectiveness of Markets for Efficiency Investments</H4> </a>
Markets remain the primary vehicle for energy decisions. However, reforms in both regulated and
unregulated markets can significantly improve the performance by which markets deliver
convenient, reliable, and affordable energy to the buildings sector. The Administration supports
market-oriented efforts to promote cost-effective investments in energy efficiency. <BR>
<P>
Recent changes in Federal law and State regulation have initiated substantial changes that will lead
to increasingly competitive and less regulated markets for the supply of electricity and natural gas.
The Administration strongly supports these developments where they are likely to improve the
overall productivity and efficiency of the utility sector and provide energy users with better price
signals and more types of utility service from which to choose. The Administration expects that
appropriate changes in the utility sector will lead to the further evolution of utility and independent
efforts to increase end-use efficiency and load management as a means of meeting the consumer
demand for reliable and affordable energy services.<BR>
<P>
Utility Integrated Resource Planning.  Regulated electric and natural gas utilities provide more than
86 percent of the energy used in residential and commercial buildings. However, retail utility rates
often differ markedly from both the marginal costs of supplying electricity and natural gas and the
marginal social costs of using energy. Therefore, consumers often do not receive accurate energy
price signals. Utility demand-side management programs, which exist in a number of States to
encourage efficiency investments, may partly compensate for the distortions created by regulated
prices in this sector. In the 5-year period ending in 1993, with the regulatory and technical support
of Federal and State government agencies, utilities spent almost $9 billion on residential and
commercial demand-side management programs. These programs will save consumers several
billion dollars annually over the next decade.<BR>
<P>
To bolster the effectiveness of utility ratepayer funds spent on the development of residential and
commercial technologies, the Federal Government has supported the establishment of a
consortium of utilities willing to coordinate their efforts in this area. The first project of this
consortium was the support of a "Golden Carrot" competition among manufacturers of
refrigerators, which resulted in the design and production of refrigerators that are 30 percent more
efficient than the current standard for comparably sized conventional units. Similar approaches are
being used for products such as high-efficiency gas and geothermal heat pumps in the Department
of Energy's Technology Introduction Partnerships.<BR>
<P>
Residential Energy-Efficiency Financing. Information on the energy efficiency of a new or
existing home is generally not available to prospective buyers, and home prices and mortgage
financing options generally are not differentiated to reflect the lower energy costs of energy-
efficient housing. The Department of Energy, together with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, private lenders, builders, and others, has helped develop and apply home energy-
rating systems that provide buyers and sellers of residential real estate with information regarding
the energy performance of homes and the economics of potential improvements. This effort is
coupled with programs to expand the availability of mortgages that explicitly recognize the link
between lower energy bills and a homeowner's ability to afford monthly mortgage payments.<BR>
<P>
Efficiency Investments in Commercial Buildings. Energy costs in commercial buildings typically
represent less than 2 percent of the total costs of the businesses or public institutions that occupy
them, which limits sustained management attention to energy-efficiency opportunities. Lacking
standardized methods for measuring and verifying the resulting energy savings, vendors of
energy-efficiency technology and energy-performance contractors are only slowly gaining market
shares in the commercial building sector. Combined with limited monitoring by building
managers and little market information on investment options, many commercial buildings harbor
profitable but yet unrealized efficiency gains.<BR>
<P>
Beginning with the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star programs (including Green
Lights and Energy Star Buildings) that target efficient commercial lighting investments and other
profitable building energy-efficiency upgrades, and continuing with the Rebuild America initiative
and other Department of Energy programs, the Federal Government has been extremely effective
at encouraging commercial building owners and tenants to lower energy consumption and bills.
Voluntary agreements to examine operations, combined with public recognition of the
environmental benefits of lowering energy use, have proven to be a powerful extra incentive for
profitable investment in energy-efficient technologies for commercial building. These programs
are coordinated with utility and State efforts to maximize the impact of modest Federal resources.<BR>
<P>
Energy-Efficiency Product Labeling.  Building energy users, especially individual consumers,
often lack the basic price and performance information necessary to make sound energy
investment and use decisions. Since the late 1970s, the Federal Government has required
performance labels on major energy-using products or building materials to help consumers make
more informed decisions. Major appliances and other home equipment have had such labels since
the program's inception, but efficiency labels for windows have only recently become widely
available. A variety of labeling and recognition programs are currently under development with the
building products industry.<BR>
<P>
Although commercial building managers and equipment purchasers tend to have access to more
information than do individual consumers, there continue to be significant gaps in this information.
For example, office equipment is a major source of increasing energy demand in this sector, but
there is still very little information available on the comparative energy efficiency and use of
different products. To fill this void the Environmental Protection Agency developed the voluntary
Energy Star office equipment labeling program. The personal computer industry has widely
adopted this program, which recognizes and highlights products with superior energy
performance.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.12">Developing New Technologies To Improve Building Efficiency</H4></a>
The Administration supports efforts to develop<a name="nt"></a><a href="ch3bx3.html"> new technologies</a> that can improve energy efficiency in buildings. The building construction industry is highly fragmented, with more than 157,000 home builders, 342,000 home improvement contractors, and tens of thousands of commercial building contractors. As a result, the industry does not support the R&D or training necessary to develop and rapidly adopt new technologies. R&D in the construction industry is just 0.5 percent of revenues, compared with 3.4 percent of revenues for other industries, on average.  Since the mid-1970s, the Federal Government has supported the successful development of a number of building energy technologies that are now in widespread use or beginning to enter the marketplace. This support remains a key element in reducing energy demand from the building sector.<BR>
<P>
The major technologies now under development in private industry and national laboratories with
the support of the Department of Energy include the gas-fired absorption (GAX) heat pump,
electrochromic window glazings, the sulfur lamp, and the 30/30 roof. Compared with other high-
efficiency heating and cooling technologies, the GAX heat pump has several significant
advantages. The system is approximately 40 percent more efficient than current technology and is
expected to reduce primary energy use for space heating, space cooling, and water heating in U.S.
residences by 0.3 quad by 2020, while reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other
environmental pollutants by more than 40 percent. Powered by natural gas, the GAX heat pump
could also reduce the electric utility peaks associated with summer cooling loads by about 18
gigawatts.<BR>
<P>
Electrochromic window glazings that switch between opacity and transparency when an electrical
charge is applied may be used to control the level of direct solar radiation admitted to a building's
interior. Such windows could offer significant energy savings and may become commonplace.<BR>
<P>
The recently developed sulfur lamp can replace conventional high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps
in many commercial applications. National annual energy savings from achieving a 10-percent
share of the U.S. HID lamp market by the year 2000 would amount to 8.7 billion kilowatthours,
worth $600 million to U.S. industry and other consumers of HID lamps. Another example is the
30/30 roof, so named for its R-30 insulation rating and expected life of 30 years. Widespread
installation of such roofs would save a minimum of 20 percent of the energy used for heating and
cooling commercial buildings across the Nation, with many buildings achieving savings of 50
percent or more. <BR>
<P>
To date, a total Federal investment of $600 million in buildings research has resulted in $23 billion
in energy savings.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.13">Cooperating With State and Community Programs That Encourage Building Efficiency</H4></a>
The Administration supports cooperative programs that effectively encourage or require improved
efficiency in buildings by linking Federal efforts with the considerable capabilities and unique
authorities of State, regional, and local government agencies.<BR>
<P>
State Programs. The Department of Energy helps fund State programs that support energy
efficiency in residential markets, and works in partnerships with State energy offices in critical
areas such as updating and enforcing building energy codes, supporting home energy rating
systems, and establishing related financing programs. Direct State support for energy-efficiency
projects has decreased considerably as a result of the gradual expenditure of oil overcharge monies
that have been used for years as a funding source for States. However, Federal financial assistance
continues to enable States to implement a broad range of unique and effective conservation
programs. <BR>
<P>
Community Programs.  In several areas, communities play a key role in leading or coordinating
the implementation of important building energy-efficiency measures. For example, the heat-
absorbing nature of many buildings and pavement surfaces can raise outdoor temperatures by 5 to
10 degrees Fahrenheit in many communities. Reducing such temperature increases can improve
outdoor comfort, reduce smog and related health effects (heat is a major contributor to smog
formation), and reduce the energy required for cooling. Without community-level action, there is
little incentive for individual building owners to invest in the lighter surfaces and strategic tree
planting that would benefit the entire community. The Administration, through its Cool
Communities initiative, provides the technical information and support needed by local
governments to promote the use of "cool" or reflective building and paving surfaces through
planning or zoning actions. <BR>
<P>
Urban development or redevelopment can also create opportunities for coordinating heating,
cooling, and electric loads in ways that substantially reduce overall energy use. District heating and
cooling systems, sometimes called community energy systems, use the "waste" heat from
electricity generation to heat or cool nearby buildings.<BR>
<P>
Recently, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and other agencies have
assisted communities that have been devastated by natural disasters, such as the Midwestern
floods of 1993, to rebuild in more sustainable ways. This technical assistance helps communities
relocate in less vulnerable areas and build infrastructure and housing that is more energy-efficient
and makes greater use of renewable resources. This new program helps communities in
immediate distress to apply their rebuilding efforts toward a long-term vision of a more secure and
prosperous life.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.14">Establishing Minimum Efficiency Standards for New Buildings and Appliances</H4></a>
Although the Administration recognizes that policies that use market forces or market-based
incentives are preferable in most circumstances, appropriate regulatory intervention can achieve
efficiency gains that will benefit consumers, businesses, and the Nation. This strategy is employed
where market barriers are particularly severe and where durable investments in equipment or
buildings will dictate energy performance over long periods of time.<BR>
<P>
Building Codes and Standards. Since the mid-1970s, most State and many local building codes
have imposed significant energy-efficiency requirements on new homes and commercial
buildings, and model codes have been upgraded several times. However, despite considerable
efforts by professional organizations, national building code organizations, and Federal agencies, a
considerable gap remains between what is considered to be economically desirable building
construction and actual practice. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires States to ensure that new
nonresidential buildings meet or exceed the efficiency standards recommended by the American
Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and it requires
States to consider requiring new homes to meet or exceed the Model Energy Code of the Council
of American Building Officials (CABO). The Department of Energy assists States and local code
jurisdictions in upgrading their building standards and improving their implementation and
enforcement. Effectively implementing updated building codes will produce substantial long-term
benefits.<BR>
<P>
Implementation of ASHRAE commercial standards is expected to reduce energy bills by $2.1
billion annually by 2010.<BR>
<P>
Effective October 1994, the Department of Housing and Urban Development  established thermal
performance requirements for manufactured housing, such as trailer homes. The Rural Housing
and Community Development Service of the Department of Agriculture is reviewing these
requirements for conformity with Department of Agriculture standards for such housing in an
effort to reduce potentially duplicative regulatory requirements on the manufactured housing
industry while maintaining adequate thermal design and construction.<BR>
<P>
Appliance and Equipment Efficiency Standards. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a number
of States established efficiency standards for major home appliances, and appliance manufacturers
petitioned the Federal Government to establish uniform preemptive national standards in the
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act in 1987. There are now national efficiency standards
for most categories of home appliances and equipment, and the Department of Energy periodically
reviews and updates these standards. The efficiency standards are established at levels where
higher purchase prices are fully offset by energy cost savings to consumers in a few years of
operation.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.15">Supporting Efficiency Investments</H4></a>
Despite Federal and other efforts to improve markets focused on the energy efficiency of
buildings, major barriers to the rapid and widespread use of economically desirable efficiency
technologies in some market segments warrant direct support. The Administration is using Federal
facilities to demonstrate leadership in energy efficiency. In addition, where appropriate, the
Administration assists low-income households in private and public buildings to weatherize and,
in some cases, to help defray high energy bills.<BR>
<P>
Federal Energy Management. The Federal Government is the largest user of energy in the United
States and probably the single largest purchaser of energy-efficient products and services. Federal
facilities ranging from offices to military apartments to hospitals use about 2.5 percent of all
energy used in commercial and residential buildings. The Federal Government has the
responsibility to set an excellent example in its own facilities and transfer lessons learned to
industry, other governments, and communities. <BR>
<P>
To "reinvent" Federal energy use, the Administration has begun to implement programs to reduce
Federal energy consumption in 2005 by 30 percent per square foot in Federal buildings, relative to
an agency's 1985 energy use. The specific actions for realizing these savings include changes in
procurement practices for everything from computers to new buildings, new ways to fund
efficiency investments, and incentives and training for energy managers.<BR>
<P>
These initiatives are being coordinated at the Federal level by the Department of Energy's Federal
Energy Management Program. About $250 million per year is being invested to improve the
energy efficiency of existing Federal buildings, which will save taxpayers billions of dollars in
future government costs. In addition to these direct investments, agencies may now use special
"energy savings performance contracts" that allow private companies to make the up-front
investments and be paid over time through the resulting cost savings. Federal agencies are also
being encouraged to participate in utility-sponsored efficiency programs. The energy code for new
Federal building construction is being revised to conform to the model codes that are familiar to
private contractors. Finally, a "procurement challenge" for Federal purchases of everything from
computers to light bulbs will encourage further energy and costs savings.<BR>
<P>
On average, every dollar invested in efficiency improvements through the Federal Energy Management Program results in $3 in savings.<BR>
<P>
Assistance to Low-Income Households. Most low-income households do not have access to the
financing necessary to support cost-effective home efficiency improvements. There are
approximately 27 million low-income households, which use about 24 percent of total energy in
the residential sector. These homes tend to be older, in worse states of repair, and substantially less
energy efficient than the rest of the housing stock. Furthermore, low-income households are
especially vulnerable to rapid price increases or severe weather that forces up utility costs. Utility
and fuel bills account for 14 percent of low-income household expenditures, compared with under
5 percent for all U.S. households. <BR>
<P>
To help low-income households achieve lasting reductions in their energy bills, the Federal
Government has supported the direct weatherization of low-income households since the mid-
1970s. Funds provided by Congress through the Department of Energy have been supplemented
by funds from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, State oil-overcharge monies,
and utilities. Through 1994, it is estimated that more than 4 million homes have been weatherized.
Ninety percent of the households served by the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance
Program have annual incomes under $15,000. For two-thirds of the households, income is under
$8,000. In 1992, the Department of Energy completed a careful evaluation of the actual energy and
cost savings resulting from the weatherization of low-income homes. Results indicated that the net
benefits of the program significantly exceeded its costs.<BR>
<P>
Energy costs for public and assisted housing, paid by the Federal Government through the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, are about $4 billion per year. These units are
substantially less energy efficient than similar market-rate dwellings and the energy costs represent
a sizable portion of their Department of Housing and Urban Development operating subsidies. To
increase the quality and affordability of low-income housing, the Department of Energy and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development have recently joined in Energy Partnerships for
Affordable Homes with the goal of 30 percent energy-efficiency gains in more than 1 million
Department of Housing and Urban Development-assisted housing units by the year 2000.<BR>
<P>
Additionally, since 1979 Congress has provided funds to the States through the Department of
Health and Human Services to assist low-income households pay energy bills, especially bills for
essential energy services, such as heating. The program has enabled hundreds of thousands of
households to avoid cutoffs of energy supplies and has enabled many others to afford minimal
levels of comfort in their homes. The program has been especially vital during periods of rapidly
rising energy costs, such as the steep rise in fuel oil costs during the 1990-91 winter, or the severe
cold of the 1993-94 winter. Currently, the Federal Government provides about $1.3 billion per
year for this purpose, which is supplemented by many utilities and some States.<BR>
<P>
Assistance for Schools, Hospitals, and Other Public Buildings. The Administration supports
efficiency investments in public and nonprofit schools and hospitals through a matching grant
program for these institutions. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, these funds were
supplemented substantially by oil-overcharge funds available to States. This program has
supported efficiency investments of $1.8 billion since 1979, and the affected institutions report
savings of $5.6 billion through fiscal year 1994. </BODY>
