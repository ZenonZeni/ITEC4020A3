                      Contract DE-FC01-94RW00295 (Since 1986)
</H3><P>
The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) is comprised of all 50 states, two U.S.
Territories (Guam and American Samoa), twelve Canadian Provinces and Territories, and Mexico. 
CVSA objectives are to enhance safety of commercial vehicles, improve commercial vehicle
operation, minimize schedule delays, ensure effective allocation of resources, and provide
reciprocity for vehicle inspections between states to avoid duplication of efforts. CVSA members
are responsible for the administration and enforcement of motor carrier safety laws. The alliance is
supported by organizations and business enterprises involved in motor carrier safety whose
interests are mutual or compatible with CVSA and its objectives.  There are more than 200
associate members which facilitate the maintenance of an industry perspective.  In cooperation
with the U.S. Department of Energy, CVSA developed uniform inspection standards for drivers,
vehicles, and loads to be used for inspection of spent fuel, high-level radioactive and transuranic
waste transportation campaigns.  It is presently involved in training inspectors as well as conducting
a pilot program to test the standards.
