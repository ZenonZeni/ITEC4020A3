BioNumerik: Super simulations<p>

Frederick Hausheer has been thinking about how to use supercomputers to design drugs since 1986, when he first used a Cray computer while at the National Cancer Institute and Johns Hopkins, and saw the potential of computer simulation to develop drugs.<p>
He reasoned that drug development is a numbers game. In cancer, for example, Hausheer estimates that if 1 in 10,000 molecules makes it into the clinic, and 1 in 40,000 shows a 20 percent response rate, it would take a century to find the 1 in a million that constitutes a cure. <p>
<b><center>'A different approach'</b></center><p>
Most companies play that numbers game by generating large numbers of molecules via traditional or automated screening methods. The problem, Hausheer says, is the resulting drugs can have major toxicities. "Shoe polish and jet fuel will kill cells," he said. "We need to address the problems of toxicity up front, and the only way to do that is to use a different approach."<p>
While rational drug design is useful, it too isn't sufficient in his view. "Crystal structure isn't a real structure, it's an average structure," he said. "Patients are not crystalline. There's no question it's important to know how the nose cone impacts on the target, but it's no less important to know how the drug gets there in the first place."<p>
Hausheer founded BioNumerik in 1992 to focus on mechanism-based drug discovery, breaking down drug targeting, metabolism and delivery to the atomic level to characterize mechanism and optimize molecular leads. BioNumerik focuses from the start on delivery, targeting, biochemical pathways and formulation. The company begins with existing compounds to re-engineer or optimize existing drugs that have problems with toxicity, delivery or efficacy. The analysis of diseases and drugs on a molecular basis is made possible through the use of supercomputing.<p>
The supercomputing functions as a way of running "human" trials on millions of compounds before ever getting into real people. "The idea is to use computers to simulate how the drug is operating in the patient's body," Hausheer said. The company can use its Cray computers to test the behavior of up to 1030 molecules in models of the human system.<p>
This approach relies on complex computational software models running on parallel supercomputers to simulate the molecular interactions and transformations of compounds in the body.<p>
 BioNumerik has relationships with Cray Research and with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Under a 1994 agreement with Cray, BioNumerik is acting as a pharmaceutical beta-test site for Cray and receives the use of supercomputer hardware and software support. A 1994 CRADA with Lawrence Livermore is developing pharmaceutical discovery software for use on massively parallel computers. The company has exclusive rights to all software developments arising from both relationships.<p>
<b><center>Analyze before committing</b></center><p>
"It's a way to get at the truth about a drug's mechanism of action faster and more reliably," said Hausheer. "This is an attempt to analyze compounds in advance of committing significant laboratory resources." The approach isn't intended to replace the work of bench scientists, but to make that work more efficient and productive.<p>
BioNumerik has 10 products in development, of which it estimates five will be in the clinic in the next 24 months. The company's first drug, MDAM, is a nonpolyglutamylatable antifolate whose parent, methotrexate, is a widely used anticancer agent. <p>
Methotrexate is toxic to healthy cells because it is polyglutamylated in the body -- successive glutamic acid groups are added to the molecule, causing methotrexate to be retained in the cell -- while MDAM is nonpolyglutamylatable. MDAM is taken up by tumor cells 3-12 times more rapidly than methotrexate, and can be given to animals in doses 4-50 times greater with the same level of toxicity. <p>
In mouse models of bowel cancer, tumor doubling time was 8.4 days with MDAM versus 4.6 days with methotrexate. There were 25 percent complete and 50 percent partial responses with MDAM versus none for methotrexate, and maximum weight loss was 8.9 percent for MDAM versus 14 percent for methotrexate.<p>
MDAM was in-licensed from Gopal Nair at the University of Alabama College of Medicine in Mobile, and BioNumerik performed the preclinical work in 18 months at a cost of $1.5 million. The compound is in Phase I trials at Johns Hopkins.<p>
The company's second compound is a novel cisplatin formulation (BNP7787) containing a protective agent designed to protect against the kidney toxicity associated with existing versions of the drug. A potential competitor to U.S. Bioscience Inc.'s Ethyol, the compound is 100 percent protective in a Fischer rat model, which is highly correlated with human toxicity. <p>
Rats treated with cisplatin alone experienced significant weight loss (10.5 percent) and reduced white blood cell counts (64,000), enlarged kidneys and other signs of acute kidney failure. Rats treated with BNP7787 gained 5.5 percent of body weight, with white blood cell counts of 105,000, and no evidence of kidney damage. The toxicity of Ethyol in rats is eight times greater than BNP7787, according to the company.<p>
Studies in tumor-bearing rats indicate that the compound retains and even increases the anti-tumor activity of cisplatin. BioNumerik plans to file an IND this quarter. The company designed and developed the compound in-house in 13 months.<p>
BioNumerik also has developed lipophilic camptothecin derivatives for cancer, with greater activity than existing water soluble camptothecins. Use of camptothecins, which are topoisomerase I inhibitors, has been limited by their high toxicity and difficulty to administer due to their poor solubility in water, as well as the high variability in effects from patient to patient. Existing compounds also are susceptible to multiple drug resistance, but Hausheer said BioNumerik's compounds are insensitive to MDR and MRP drug resistance. <p>
BioNumerik's small molecule lipophilic camptothecins potentially are orally deliverable, and would be suitable for chronic low-dose therapy. The company projects filing an IND on a lead compound in the second half of the year.<p>
A fourth program is developing small peptide inhibitors of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP). The compounds have shown prolonged elevation of HDL (high density lipoprotein) in baboons. BioNumerik also is developing a small molecule that has shown the ability to significantly raise HDL and lower LDL when administered orally in baboons.<p>
The company has raised $16.5 million and is spending $300,000 a month.<p>
