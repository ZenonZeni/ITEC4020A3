<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PC-Based Robotic Simulation Software Available to Rent or
Lease</H1>
<P><B>Fort Myers , FL</B> (November 10, 1995):  WORKSPACE&#174;, the
revolutionary robot simulation software that runs on a personal computer (PC),
including notebooks, is now available to rent or lease.  That means the already
low-priced software can be installed immediately by manufacturers who thought
they had to wait for another budget cycle.</P>
<P>Robotic Workspace Technologies (RWT), Inc., exclusive North American
marketers of WORKSPACE, recently added the rent and lease options, said CEO
Walter K. Weisel.  &quot;For an average of $1,500 a month, a manufacturer can
lease this highly sophisticated software that creates and simulates robotic
workcells and other production processes with its own 3D CAD system.&quot;  The
lease fee converts to $8-10 an hour for a single shift, and less than $5 an hour
for a double shift.</P>
<P>WORKSPACE features include simulation, a 3D CAD modeler, off-line
programming in the robot's native language, and on-line robot and workcell
calibration.  &quot;For the first time, manufacturers have the ability to prove
out the feasibility of robotic workcells before they commit to hardware,&quot;
Weisel said.</P>
<P>In addition to the lease program, which can be converted to a purchase at
any time, RWT rents WORKSPACE for individual simulation projects.  RWT also
provides support to get new users up and running, and a three-day training
period is included in the lease fee.</P>
<P>&quot;There are many advantages to the rent/lease opportunities,&quot;
Weisel said.  &quot;Two are critical.  First, a manufacturer who cannot
authorize a $28,000 capital investment to buy the system today can lease now
rather than wait to convert to this cost- and time-saving system in six months,
a year or more.  Second, there are still some who just can't believe how
accurate and easy it is to operate WORKSPACE.  They now have a chance to work
with the PC-based simulation software before they decide to install the system
permanently.&quot;</P>
