<p><strong>Domestic Applications</strong>
<P>
Through program-sponsored projects for domestic applications, manufacturers gain experience
supplying potential markets, buyers gain experience with PV systems, and researchers obtain
technical feedback to improve products and processes. These projects validate PV systems for
grid support, demand-side management, grid-connected applications, and remote applications. 
<P>
Utility PhotoVoltaic Group (UPVG)
<P>
<a target=_parent href="http://www.ttcorp.com/upvg">UPVG</a> was formed in 1992 to accelerate utility acceptance of PV in grid-tied applications
and cost-effective small-scale applications. By 1995, the group contained 89 member utilities
that produce almost half of the electricity consumed in the United States. The program provides
financial and technical support to the group to test PV systems in domestic utility applications.

Photovoltaics for Utility-Scale Applications (PVUSA)
<P>
Under this project, we study and validate utility-scale applications.  We installed and continue to
support the world's first transmission and distribution system powered by PV at the PVUSA test
site in California.
<P>
Building Opportunities in the United States for Photovoltaics (PV:BONUS)
<P>
Buildings use about two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States. There is also a
great deal of space on the roofs and walls of these buildings that could support PV generation
capacity. According to one study, between 270 and 320 megawatts of PV would be cost-effective on buildings at a system cost of $3000 per kilowatt. Incorporating PV into buildings at
the design and construction stage lowers costs and increases the value of the electricity
generated. 
<P>
Through PV:BONUS, we help teams from the building industry develop prototype PV products
that could replace conventional windows, skylights, and walls while generating electricity.
Because incorporating PV into building materials is technically complex, we also help industry
develop the technology for <a href="award.html">PV roofing material</a>, <a href="pvbatcase.html">PV modular homes</a>, an alternating-current PV module, and <a href="utilitycase.html">peak-shaving PV</a> that utilities can dispatch. 
<P>
Photovoltaics for Federal Agency Applications
<P>
Federal agencies have been directed to reduce their energy consumption and their use of fossil
fuels, opening a large potential market for PV. The Strategic Environmental Research and
Development Program (a joint program of DOE, the Department of Defense, and the
Environmental Protection Agency) has estimated that more than 3000 megawatts of PV&#151;mostly
grid-connected systems larger than 500 kilowatts&#151;could be justified for military uses today. We
support federal agencies interested in deploying PV systems. Federal government procurement
procedures require information and certification of PV systems, and we're working on
performance testing and certification projects to provide uniform, long-term performance data.
