        </center> A Message to Subscribers from Kenneth B.
        Swenson, Chairman of The Virginia Insurance Reciprocal
        Board of Directors, and William F. Jacobs, President of
        The Virginia Insurance Reciprocal.</font> <p> The changes
        in the healthcare field now are well documented. How the
        Virginia Insurance Reciprocal (TVIR) responds to the
        changes will determine its future. If 1995 is an
        indicator, TVIR will continue to be a successful
        organization. In spite of the dramatic changes, TVIR
        enjoyed an outstanding year. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer satisfaction is high, with 93 percent of
                customers renewing their policies in 1995. </li>
            <li>Net income increased to more than $10 million,
                the 10th consecutive year of profits. </li>
            <li>Policyholders' surplus has grown to $78.7
                million. </li>
            <li>Approximately $6 million in equity was returned
                to hospitals in Virginia, Tennessee and
                Mississippi last year. Since 1980, the total
                equity returned to subscribers exceeds $50
                million. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#800000">TVIR moved out in front of change
        in 1995 through bold new initiatives:</font> <ul>
            <li>We encouraged the formation of The Reciprocal
                Alliance, a new insurance company that will meet
                the needs of healthcare systems in the managed
                care era. </li>
            <li>A system was developed to designate Preferred
                Agents in selected markets, to expand marketing
                efforts in areas not served directly by our
                marketing staff. </li>
            <li>Internally senior management initiated a
                strategic thinking process, enabling us to
                conduct business based on a continuous evaluation
                of current information about customers and
                markets. </li>
            <li>The staff was involved in surveys, task forces
                and more focused communication to become a more
                customer-driven, well-trained organization. </li>
        </ul>
        The results demonstrate the work. Three prestigious
        healthcare systems became new subscribers, and AHA
        Services, an affiliate of the Arkansas Hospital
        Associate, gave its exclusive endorsement to TVIR.
        Management is confident that the forward momentum of TVIR
        will continue in 1996 with favorable results from a full
        year of the Preferred Agents system, the Arkansas
        endorsement and the impact of the Alliance. As a
        customer-owned organization, TVIR is focused on customers
        and driven by them. TVIR is innovative and flexible, and
        meeting the needs of the healthcare field. <p> Our
        success is due to how well the people affiliated with
        TVIR work together. The advice and counsel of our
        governing organizations offer enormous benefits, helping
        us to stay a step ahead of changes in the industry. At
        the same time, senior management provides outstanding
        leadership, initiating marketing strategies that reflect
        the vision of TVIR. Carrying out these initiatives are
        the officers and staff of VPUI professionals who have
        committed themselves to fulfilling our customer-focused
        mission. Together, the TVIR team is prepared for the
        future, and we are excited about helping our customers
        meet the needs of the people and communities they serve. </p>
