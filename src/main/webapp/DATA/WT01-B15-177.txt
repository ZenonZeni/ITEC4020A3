<BODY>
The Yucca Mountain Project has always provided an open door to the public. One way it has
done so has been by making the Yucca Mountain personnel and various information resources
and facilities very accessible to the public. <P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, the Yucca Mountain Project conducted over 167 tours of the mountain
and its facilities. In 1995, over 3,574 people set aside an entire day to see for themselves how
scientists are studying the geology, hydrology, weather patterns, and flora and fauna of this area.
Included among the visitors during 18 fact-finding tours were 12 members of Congress and over
200 congressional staff members. 

<H3>Mountain Tour Highlights</H3>

During a typical mountain tour, visitors can:<P>
<UL>
<LI> Visit the crest of Yucca Mountain and learn how the mountain was formed<P>

<LI> See ancient volcanic cinder cones and discuss the prospects (extremely slim) that they'll erupt
in the next 10,000 years<P>

<LI> Talk to scientists about the geologic features of Yucca Mountain and how they might
contribute to the isolation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste<P>

<LI> Stop by the entrance to the construction of a sophisticated underground laboratory called the
Exploratory Studies Facility (the facility now provides scientists with an underground view of the
rock where a repository could be built)<P>

<LI> View exhibits that explain the various studies.<P>
</UL>


<H3>Science Centers: A Place To Ask Questions</H3>

The Yucca Mountain Project operates three science centers in Las Vegas, Beatty, and Pahrump,
Nevada. These are designed to offer the public an opportunity to explore the complexities of a
large-scale scientific project such as this one. In 1995, these science centers attracted over 15,000
visitors.<P>

Tours through the science centers are intended to help answer questions and address public
concerns about the Project. At the Las Vegas Science Center, visitors can even take an elevator
ride down to the Climax Mine Spent Fuel Test, a replica of a test conducted more than a decade
ago. Results of this test showed how spent nuclear fuel could be placed underground, stored, and
then retrieved successfully.<P>

There are other exhibits, displays, and specialty rooms, such as a geology room where visitors
learn about volcanoes, earthquakes, the travel time of water moving through the mountain, and
minerals. Individuals wishing to engage in independent research, meanwhile, may avail
themselves of resource areas containing collections of reading and audiovisual material pertinent
to the Project, including print information from public-domain sources.<P>
<P>
Science center visitors also attend a variety of scientific lectures offered as part of a year-round
speaker series. Topics range from earthquakes and geologic faults to desert wildflowers; from the
movement of water through rocks to the effects of light, sound, and electromagnetic waves.
People engage with experts in assorted fields; view informative illustrations, photographs, and
videos; ask questions; and broaden their knowledge on various subjects of general and specific
interest.<P>
<P><P>

"Discovery Day" events are scheduled yearly at these centers, providing an opportunity for the
public, and particularly for parents and children, to engage in shared, hands-on learning
experiences. At a Discovery Day with a geology theme, for instance, people built volcanoes,
made fossils, learned what a geologic fault is, and found out about the best locations to look for
gold. Last year's event attracted over 225 people.<P>

The point of all of these activities &#150 tours of the mountain and visits to Project science centers &#150 is
to provide avenues to access information. Visitors come because they want to see for themselves
what's going on, because they recognize an opportunity for public and personal involvement, and
because the resources at their disposal make it possible to use all the information available to
draw their own conclusions.

<H3>Tours of Yucca Mountain</H3>

The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management's Yucca Mountain Project invites you to
take tours of the Yucca Mountain area and to talk to scientists and staff members about ongoing
studies.<P>
<P>

<img  Alt="[Photograph:  Public tours of Yucca Mountain begin at the Las Vegas Science Center where there are many hands-on exibits that help people understand how Yucca Mountain and other geologic features were formed.] " src="outrch2.jpg " Align=right height=225 width=200>



Reservations should be made at least 14 days in advance by calling (702) 794-7104 during
business hours. Tours will be filled on a first-come, first served basis.<P>
<P>
Yucca Mountain is about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. To visit the site, information such as
full names, addresses, social security numbers, dates and places of birth, and telephone numbers
must be provided when making a reservation. Tours are open to any U.S. citizen over the age of
14. Non-U.S. citizens must allow for about a month between applying and receiving
authorization to take the tour.<P>
<P>
Box lunches will be provided for $4 per person. Lunches come with beverages, but sodas can be
purchased for an additional 60 cents.<P><HR>
