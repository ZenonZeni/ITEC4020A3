<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Financing Your Children's Education</STRONG></FONT><P>

Millions of Americans, especially the "Baby Boomers" born in the 20 years following
World
War II, now
have children of their own and are starting to think about how to pay for future
educational
expenses.
Four years at the best universities can now cost close to $100,000, and these
expenses
have been
rising faster than inflation. Middle-income families that do not expect to benefit
from
scholarships or
receive substantial financial aid must save this money in advance or borrow it
later. The
simplest way to
save money is in a savings account at a bank, but more sophisticated investments
may
provide better
returns. <P>

<P>
One factor that slows the growth of savings is income taxes, which apply to
ordinary bank
interest.
Consider a long term certificate of deposit paying 7 percent interest. If $10,000
were
invested and
accumulated tax-free for 15 years, it would grow to $27,590. However, if Federal
and state
income taxes
took 35 percent of the interest every year, the initial $10,000 investment would
grow to just
$19,492. The
difference, $8,098, is significant. Even if the taxes on interest had to be paid
when the
money was
withdrawn, after 15 years, the $27,590 would be reduced to $21,434, still $1,942
ahead of
paying the
taxes annually. The difference is due to interest earned on the tax dollars that
were not paid
until
later.<P>

For many years, the tax laws provided numerous ways to defer income taxes on
investment
earnings.
(Deferred taxes are not paid immediately but are paid later, usually when funds are
withdrawn. Income
taxes cannot normally be avoided forever, except at death.) During the 1980s, most
of those
special
rules were repealed. Three notable, but by no means the only, exceptions involve
life
insurance, mutual
funds, and U.S. savings bonds.<P>

Life insurance proceeds paid at death have always been free of income taxes. Less
well-known, but
equally important, is the fact that the growth in cash value of insurance policies
is also
tax-free for
individuals as long as the funds remain in the policy and are not withdrawn. Thus,
the cash
value
accumulates without any tax reduction and can be borrowed when needed to pay for
education (or for
other reasons) without tax consequences in most cases.<P>

A special rule applies to so-called "modified endowment contracts," policies that
are strongly
investment-oriented. Check with your agent to see if your policy qualifies as a
borrowed
when needed to
pay for education (or for other reasons) without tax consequences in most
cases.modified
endowment
contract.<P>

Mutual funds can also provide tax advantages. Even if the mutual fund pays
currently
taxable interest or
dividends, income taxes can be reduced by putting assets in a child's name. Until
1987, this
technique,
which relies on the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA), was very effective in
reducing
income taxes,
because all income was taxed at the child's rate, which normally is low. Then
Congress
changed the
law, so that so-called "unearned" income (which includes interest and dividends)
received
by children
under age 14 is partly taxed at the rate applying to the child's parents. Even so,
children
under 14 can
receive up to $550 in unearned income without paying any income tax. The
next
$550 is taxed
at the child's own tax rate, typically 15 percent. Any unearned income exceeding
$1,100 is
taxed at the
parents' rate.<P>

Another investment possibility with tax advantages is U.S. Savings bonds. These
bonds are
purchased
for half their face amount and pay variable market-based interest rates if held for
five years
or longer.
The interest rate is 85 percent of the rate on certain Treasury securities and
varies every six
months.
Federal income tax is normally not paid until the bonds are redeemed, and they are
complete exempt
from state income taxes.<P>

education in
most cases, ask your tax adviser about your own situation.
