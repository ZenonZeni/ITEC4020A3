<p><font size="3">AN &quot;OPIUM JOINT&quot; RAIDED.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">LEE YOUNG'S PLACE ON PARK STREET CLEANED OUT BY
THE POLICE.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">All the Chinese resorts in the Sixth Precinct
are closely watched to note visits of girls of tender age, who
are, in a certain sense, wards of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. So last evening, when a girl of twelve
years halted in front of Lee Young's opium joint, 104 Park
Street, looked up and down the street in a half- scared way, and
went swiftly into the place, which is one step down, Detective
Joseph Schirmer was alert, and when, ten minutes later, she came
out she was followed until out of sight of those who were
lounging about the den, and then accosted and taken to the
Elizabeth Street Station House.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">She began to tell a number of stories and
endeavored to make Capt. Brooks believe that she was enticed into
the place. No harm befell her, she said, but a Chinaman chatted
with her while she watched a number of his countrymen who were
smoking opium. This was evidence enough to warrant a raid, and
the reserve force of the precinct was called out and a descent
was made on the den.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Lee Young and fourteen other Celestials were
arrested and locked up. Eleven pipes, 15 bowls, 8 pots, and 5
boxes of opium, 6 &quot;lay outs,&quot; 4 trays, scales, 2
revolvers, and $82 in money were seized. Then the girl, who is
Catherine Schuyler of 123 Monroe Street, was again questioned and
she admitted that she was sent to the den to buy 10 cents worth
of opium for Annie Golden of Jefferson and Monroe Streets. No
such person was found and after Catherine's parents had been
visited the police were of the opinion that a woman in their
house sent the child for the drug.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Catherine was sent to the headquarters of Mr.
Gerry's society, and will be at the Tombs today, when the
prisoners are arraigned.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Young's &quot;joint&quot; was raided a short
time ago, when it was kept by Hung Lung. Nineteen persons were
arrested, and six of them who were found smoking opium were fined
$25 each. No one was smoking when the police burst into the
place, which is about 8 by 14 feet.</font></p>
