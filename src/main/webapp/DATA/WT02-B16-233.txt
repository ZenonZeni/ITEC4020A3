<p><font size=+2>W</font>here utility power is available, a grid-connected PV system 
can supply some of the energy needed and use the utility in place of batteries.

<P>Some homeowners, considered pioneers in the energy field, are
using PV systems connected to the utility grid. They are doing so
because they like that the system reduces the amount of
electricity they purchase from the utility each month. They also
like the fact that PV consumes no fuel and generates no
pollution. 

<P>The owner of a grid-connected PV system can not only buy, but 
can also sell, electricity each month. This is because electricity generated by
the PV system can be used on site or fed through a meter into the
utility grid. When a home or business requires more electricity
than the PV array is generating (for example, in the evening), the
need is automatically met by power from the utility grid. When
the home or business requires less electricity than the PV array
is generating, the excess is fed (or sold) back to the utility.
Used this way, the utility backs up the PV like batteries do in
stand-alone systems. At the end of the month, a credit for
electricity sold gets deducted from charges for electricity
purchased.
