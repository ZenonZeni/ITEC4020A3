Spring Cleanup Resumes on Alaska's Beaches

     On 1 May, Exxon deployed its first five cleanup squads,
totaling 100 workers from Seward and Valdez, back to the beaches
in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA.  The beaches were polluted
by nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil that spilled from the
tanker Exxon Valdez in March 1989.
     For the past several weeks, survey teams walked these beaches
to determine both surface and subsurface oiling conditions.  The
teams -- made up of Exxon employees, state and federal
representatives, scientists, and land owners -- recorded their
observations with maps, sketches, and questionnaires that asked
about location, oil coverage, oil characteristics, and their
suggested method of cleanup.  Thus far, two out of three
surveillance phases are complete: crews have studied close to 480
miles of beach in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska.
The third phase will begin this week and will address the
remaining priority areas in the Gulf of Alaska (86.4 miles).
     At the end of each day, the groups faxed their findings back
to Exxon's command center in Anchorage where a Technical Advisory
Group (the TAG team) in Anchorage plugged the information into a
decision matrix.  The TAG teams are made up of representatives
from Exxon, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation
(ADEC), the US Coast Guard (USCG), and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
     Days before cleanup was to begin, crews deployed boom in
environmentally sensitive areas, near commercial fishing areas and
where wildlife has begun to migrate for the spring.  The squads
sent out on 1 May will begin removing tar mats and debris from:
Herring Bay; Seal Island; northwest Prince William Sound; south
Prince William Sound; and Kenai and the Gulf of Alaska.
     Officials have not yet established a general cleanup plan,
especially for subsurface oil.  The disagreement has, for the most
part, centered around the use of bioremediation.  Though there are
few practical alternatives to bioremediation, and although the
USCG, NOAA, and Exxon agree that it is the best solution for this
summer's cleanup, ADEC, which has undergone agency personnel
changes and claims there is not enough time and information to
make a knowledgeable decision, has not yet approved its use.  ADEC
is expected to give its answer within the next few days.

Bulgarian Vessel Sinks, Spills Diesel Fuel Near Stornoway,
Scotland

     At 0022 LT on 25 April, the 2,654-ton Bulgarian motor stern
fish factory ship Kondor sank three kilometers east of Kebock Head
(Lat 58 0.25N, Long 06 18.4W), south of the town of Stornoway, on
the Isle of Lewis, Scotland.  The vessel, owned by Okeansky
Ribolov of Bourgas, Bulgaria, was under tow following a grounding
on Sgeir Graidach (Lat 57 48N, Long 06 28W).  At 1600 LT, the crew
of the fishery protection vessel Sulisker confirmed that the
sunken vessel was leaking diesel oil and lubricating oil.  The
Kondor's masters estimated that there were 17,000 to 24,000
gallons of diesel oil and 1,500 to 1,800 gallons of lubricating
oil in the vessel's bunkers.  "Although there are no estimates of
the actual amount that has spilled thus far, all of it will
eventually seep out," said Ian Stephen, an officer with the
Stornoway Coast Guard.
     Officials were concerned about the proximity of the spill to
local fish farms and the use of dispersants in this location, even
though it was a "fairly light spillage," David Deas of the British
Marine Pollution Control Unit (MPCU) in London told OSIR.  The
MPCU finally gave permission for the Sulisker to apply 2.1 cubic
tons of dispersant at 2145 LT on the evening of 25 April.  The
MPCU, after approval from local authorities, the Nature
Conservancy Council, and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries in Scotland, applied an additional four tons of
dispersants from aircraft over the next two days.  The MPCU has
taken no further action after 28 April, according to Deas.
     Stephen told OSIR that the diesel fuel slick was surveyed
twice in the last two days -- once by a Coast Guard boat and once
by a Nature Conservancy boat.  Both surveys showed the 1.9- by
3.7- kilometer slick to be breaking up and moving north and south
away from the coastline of the Isle of Lewis.  "There was great
concern about the large number of fish farms in the sea lochs
along the coast," said Stephen, "but it may not be as bad as
originally feared."
     The Kondor, which was a part of a large fleet of "Klondikers"
that buy mackerel and herring fish from local fishermen during
on-sea transactions, will continue to leak what remains of its
fuel oil, according to Stephen.  "It is hoped that nature will
take its course and disperse the fuel oil naturally," Deas told
OSIR.

USCG Tanker Safety Study Group Releases Final Report

     The US Coast Guard (USCG) recently released its final report
of the Tanker Safety Study Group.  The five USCG officers in the
study group, headed by USCG Rear Admiral H.H. Bell, meant the
45-page report to be an internal working document.  However, the
report, dated October 1989, was made public two weeks ago.
     The report is a comprehensive review of the USCG's US and
foreign tankship inspection programs, a review that has not taken
place for over a decade.  Among the problems outlined in the
report, the study group found that: there are too few inspectors,
many of whom are overworked or inexperienced; present-day ships
are made with less steel and travel at higher speeds, making them
more vulnerable to cracking; and crews have been reduced, making
crewmembers fatigued and overworked.  "The age-old problem of too
few people and not enough fully qualified inspectors still exists.
These problems have been around for years although their magnitude
has increased rapidly since 1982.  Decreased budgets, manpower
cuts, larger ships, more sophisticated shipboard systems, quicker
turn-around times, and the shifting emphasis of USCG duties from
safety to law enforcement have had far-reaching effects on the
program."
     For a copy of the report, contact the OSIR Hotline.

US EPA Extends Compliance Dates for UST operators

     The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently
extended the financial responsibility compliance dates for two
petroleum underground storage tank (UST) owners and operators.
Petroleum marketers owning between 13 and 99 tanks who were
required to comply by 26 April 1990, now have until 26 April 1991.
Those owning between one and 12 USTs, those having fewer than 100
at one site, non-marketers with less than $20 million tangible net
worth, and local governments have until 26 October 1991 to comply
instead of 26 October 1990.
     The requirements fall under subtitle I of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which demands that owners and
operators of USTs meet certain financial responsibilities in
cleanup and third-party damages resulting from leaks.  Petroleum
marketers owning 1,000 or more USTs and non-marketers with more
than $20 million in tangible net worth were required to comply in
January 1989; and petroleum marketers owning between 100 and 999
USTs were required to comply in October 1989.
     The EPA recognizes that those in the third and fourth
compliance groups, however, need more time to comply.  Many of
them cannot obtain insurance because they cannot meet insurers'
underwriting requirements.  "We heard loud and clear ... about
unnecessary hardships that would be imposed by the earlier
compliance dates," said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly.  "In
some cases, the affected service station or store is the only
available facility for miles around and without adequate assurance
funding would have had to close.  The challenge we face along with
Congress and the states is to protect groundwater and the
environment from leaking USTs while making sure that mom-and-pop
gas stations and other small operators are not subjected to
needless economic hardships because of real problems in securing
the required insurance arrangements.  This is a problem that we
intend to solve in order to make this important program succeed."
     To date, 34 states have enacted legislation creating state
assurance funds to help owners comply with the requirements and to
clean up releases.  However, the EPA has approved only seven of
these to be used as compliance mechanisms.  The states and the EPA
will use the additional time to approve the funds and make them
operational.

Amoco Pipeline Ruptures in Texas

     On 24 April, an Amoco pipeline ruptured and spilled an
estimated 50,000 gallons of crude oil into Millsap Lake, in
Millsap, Texas, USA.  Amoco spotted the four-inch-thick slick from
the air, and immediately hired local contractors to begin cleanup
efforts with sorbent booms and vacuum trucks.  Though workers
placed boom around the water intakes, heavy rains and local
flooding caused some oil and sorbent pads to be washed past the
booms and into the nearby Brazos River.  The Texas Department of
Health sampled the lake water, which services 300 customers, and
determined that Millsap's water requirements can be safely met by
adjusting the water intake to a depth of 30-48 inches.  Officials
expect environmental damage to be minimal.

US Barge Spills 10,000 Gallons in Texas

     The 246-foot US tank barge MGM 2001 leaked approximately
10,000 gallons of #2 diesel fuel into the Colorado River at the
Way Energy dock, Texas City, Texas, USA, on 22 April.  Workers
from Georgia Transporters of Panama City, Florida, USA -- the
operator of the tug that was pulling both the MGM 2001 and the MGM
2002 -- noticed the leak near the #1 starboard tank.  Divers
confirmed reports of a crack three to ten inches wide and five to
six feet long.  The barge carried a total of 500,000 gallons.
     The tug's operator first contacted the two companies in the
area, Way Energy and Hoechst Celanese Chemical, for assistance.
Celanese sent out about 300 feet of boom until Martin Gas Marine,
the owner of the barges, hired Garner Environmental Services of
Houston, Texas, to set up an additional 2,500 feet of containment
and sorbent boom around the barge, and at two locations across the
entrance to the Colorado River turning basin.  With the help of
sorbent pads and sweeps and vacuum trucks, crews were able to
recover about 44,000 gallons of oil/water.  Salvage crews pumped
the remaining oil in the tank to barge MGM 2002.  "This cleanup
went better than the one a month ago in Freeport, Texas (OSIR, 29
March)," Richard Rhodes, USCG investigation officer in charge of
pollution, told OSIR.  "This time we had better weather and tides
 ... and it was in an ideal area.  In the Freeport spill, the
tides switched three times on us."
     The barge is currently undergoing permanent repairs at the
Channel Shipyard in Channelview, Texas.  An investigation into the
cause of the accident is underway.  "The captain says he didn't
hit anything," said Rhodes, "but I can't imagine how that crack
got there."

Exxon Rejects Environmental Proposals

At Exxon's annual shareholders meeting on 25 April in Houston,
Texas, USA (OSIR, 24 April), Exxon overwhelmingly rejected six
proposals by a small portion of the 1,850 shareholders present to
establish "responsible" environmental policies, including a
proposal to adopt the "Valdez Principles," a set of corporate
guidelines to safeguard the environment.  Exxon further implied
that the company has no intention of voluntarily replacing its
tanker fleet with double-hulled vessels.

Judge Rules Against Limited Liability in Glacier Bay Spill

     US District Court Judge H. Russel Holland recently ruled that
the owner (Trinidad Shipping Co.) and operators of the tanker
Glacier Bay, which spilled 160,000 gallons of crude oil into Cook
Inlet, Alaska, USA, in 1987 may not limit their liability to $6.6
million, the value of the ship and its cargo, under the Liability
Limitation Act of 1851.  In its complaint, Trinidad claimed that
the 1851 law held precedence over the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
Authorization Act (TAPAA), which holds a spiller liable for $14
million and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund liable for
another $86 million.  But Holland ruled that TAPAA repealed the
Limitation Act in this instance.

Comprehensive US Contingency Plan Review Due Out Shortly

     In an October 1989 US General Accounting Office study on the
adequacy of preparation and response of the US Coast Guard (USCG)
to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the USCG reported that it had
initiated a nationwide study of contingency plans, "because of the
President's concern about the nation's ability to respond to major
spills."
     The USCG study has since evolved into a review by the entire
federal government including the fourteen agencies that make up
the National Response Team -- the Environmental Protection Agency,
the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the
Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the
Department of Transportation, the State Department, the Department
of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Department of the Interior, the Federal
Emergency Management Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission -- and all the USCG Regional Response Teams, according
to Commander Doug Lentsch of the USCG Chief Pollution Response
Branch in Washington, DC, USA.  The review includes a total of 75
reports from these various agencies.  "It will be a snapshot in
time, as to where we stood at the time the report was done,"
Lentsch told OSIR.  "The basis of it is well-founded.  What the
politicians will do with it is unknown."  According to Lentsch,
the nationwide US contingency plan review, still awaiting the
signatures of the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Secretary of Transportation, is due out in a few weeks.

Barge Spills 18,000 gallons of Gasoline in Kentucky

     On 23 April, the 206-foot US barge Chotin 2880 struck a
submerged object and spilled an estimated 18,000 gallons of
unleaded gasoline while mooring at the Southern States Petroleum
facility on the Ohio River, Owensboro, Kentucky, USA.  According
to the USCG Marine Safety Office in Louisville, Kentucky, the
submerged object, believed to be a "D" ring off of the mooring
cell, caused an 18-inch by 2-inch crack in the vessel's hull,
approximately six inches below the waterline.  Although crews
smelled gasoline, they did not observe a sheen, since most of the
gasoline evaporated in the warm weather.  A local cooperative,
Owensboro Cooperative, deployed boom around the vessel and
offloaded the remaining product.  The lightering of the vessel
caused the crack to rise above the waterline, which stopped the
discharge.  The vessel is currently on its way to Owensboro River
Service for permanent repairs.
     To prevent barges from hitting the "D" rings in the future,
USCG Lt. Terry Hoover told OSIR, the local towing company will
install fenders between the barges and the mooring cells and
Southern States will weld metal beams outside the mooring cells.
