<H2>NAMI And Young Families</H2>
<HR>

"It is imperative that we do more outreach to young families facing the 
difficulties of raising a child with a neurobiological disorder," Laurie 
Flynn stated last winter in The Journal, a quarterly publication of the 
California Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  From its inception, NAMI has 
worked to provide support, education, and advocacy for individuals of all 
ages with serious and persistent mental illnesses.  
<p>
Yet, today, in our 16th year, families of children under the age of eighteen
constitute a relatively small percentage of our organization's membership. 
This is troubling for two reasons.  The first is what NAMI has to offer 
young families.  When looking back to the age of onset of their ill family 
member's symptoms, at least half of NAMI families admit that their child or 
sibling was under eighteen.  Their experiences can help young families as 
they face the challenges of finding services and making the transition from 
childhood's school-based systems to the adult-services sector.  The second 
reason is that NAMI needs young families to continue its work of advocacy 
and support into the future.  An aging NAMI membership must give serious 
consideration to the long-term prospects of NAMI's existence and its 
continued ability to advocate on behalf of the persistent and severely 
mentally ill.
<p>
To continue renewing NAMI's fellowship, the referral of young families and 
efforts to meet their unique needs must be a priority.  Unlike older 
families who in many instances are retired and looking primarily for 
support-group services, young families are in need of a greater array of 
assistance from those already experienced in obtaining services for their 
family member.
<p>
In particular, young families require assistance in linking up with 
experienced healthcare professionals who will provide a diagnosis and 
treatment for their youngster with a neurobiological disorder.  These 
families also need detailed information about how to deal with the local 
school systems that significantly impact the education and related services 
available to their child.  They may also require referrals to local 
family-service agencies.
<p>
Serving families of children and adolescents with neurobiological disorders 
is a challenge for many NAMI affiliates, especially at the local level.  
Active members may feel unable to provide the level of support and 
information young families need.  Addressing this issue, NAMI's board of 
directors decided that the national headquarters should include one staff 
member devoted exclusively to young family outreach.  Mrs. Brenda Souto was 
appointed in mid-November as the young family outreach coordinator.  Mrs. 
Souto, a professional outreach specialist, has been active in the child and 
adolescent network of AMI of Montgomery County, Maryland. 
<p>
During the next months the new family outreach coordinator will provide 
affiliates with information they can use in answering inquiries from young 
families with a child or adolescent identified with a neurobiological 
disorder.  She is developing a NAMI brochure welcoming young families and 
a NAMI Rolodex card.  (A fact sheet for young families is already in 
distribution through the NAMI Helpline.)  One of Mrs. Souto's early efforts 
will provide affiliates techniques to increase referrals from healthcare 
professionals who see young families.  She also plans to elaborate on a 
start-up manual for children and adolescent groups that will build on the 
NAMI-CAN Start Up Kit Carol Howe developed a few years ago.  The manual will
provide AMI affiliates with resources to assist young family members and to 
grow the young family groups within affiliates.  This resource is expected 
to be available at the July 1996 NAMI convention in Nashville.
