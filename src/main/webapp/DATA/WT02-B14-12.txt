Action on Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
The House Judiciary Committee, completed its markup of the 364-page Immigration
in the National Interest Act, HR 2202, on October 24, 1995, voting 23-10 to
send the bill to the full House.  According to primary author Rep. Smith
(R-TX), HR 2202 represents a consensus on what to do about legal and illegal
immigration.<p>
Republican leaders say the House may not consider HR 2202 until 1996, when it
may inject the immigration issue into the 1996 campaign.<p>
There were two major fights in the markup.  The first, in September, was
whether to establish a national registry that includes data on persons legally
authorized to work in the US.  The registry stayed in the bill on a 17-15 vote,
but it would begin as a pilot program in five states, sunset on October 1,
1999, and could be expanded nationally only by a vote of Congress.<p>
The second major issue was resolved on October 11.  The Committee voted 20-14
along party lines to not to divide the immigration reform legislation into
separate legal and illegal immigration bills.  Treating legal and illegal
immigration together increases the chance that Congress will approve the
reduction of places for family members by 30 percent.<p>
Extra slots would be made available during the first five years to reduce the
backlog of one million spouses and children of legal immigrants waiting to be
unified with their families in the US, so that legal immigration is expected to
be about 700,000 per year over the next five years, down from 800,000 in 1994
and 1995.<p>
The debate on reducing family immigration was marked by Democratic assertions
that most immigrants are hard-working "super Americans," while Republicans
claimed that many legal immigrants live in the US "at taxpayers' expense."<p>
On October 12, the committee voted to require asylum applicants to request
asylum within 30 days of arriving in the US, an effort to deter applications
from aliens apprehended in the US.  HR 2202 sets a target of first 75,000, and
later 50,000, refugees per year.<p>
Near the end of the markup, the Committee added 27,000 diversity immigrant
slots for persons from countries that have not sent many immigrants to the
United States in recent times.  An amendment that would have required all
ceremonies for the swearing in of new citizens to be conducted in English was
defeated.<p>
Title 1 of the eight-title bill deals with deterring illegal immigration, which
the bill would attempt to do by mandating a 14-mile triple fence on the
US-Mexican border south of San Diego, and adding another 1,000 Border Patrol
agents. <p>
Title 2 increased penalties on illegal aliens who falsely claim to be US
citizens in order to vote, and Title 3 requires most persons in the US
illegally for one year or more to remain outside the US for at least 10 years
before immigrating legally.<p>
Title 8 of the House bill deals with non-immigrants.  Under the marked-up bill,
US employers wanting to bring foreign workers temporarily to the US would be
divided into two groups: those that were "H-1B dependent," and other employers.
<p>
H-1B dependent employers -- those with 10 percent or more H-1B workers in their
labor forces -- would be required to file certain attestations, but employers
with fewer foreign workers would not need to provide such documentation.  This
represents a considerable loosening of the regulations under which
non-immigrant workers enter the US.<p>
Most newspaper editorial boards support immigration reform.  For example, most
California newspapers endorsed the House bill in October, praising its emphasis
on nuclear family unification, and asserting that stopping the admission of
extended family members was a reasonable trade-off.  Liberal papers often made
their endorsement contingent on removing from the bill provisions that, e.g.,
bar even naturalized citizens from some federal welfare programs.<p>
Opponents of HR 2202 include businesses that benefit from immigration, ethnic
groups, and civil liberties advocates. Ethnic and religious groups opposed<b>
</b>reductions in annual immigration and refugee admissions--some 50 Latino
groups announced the formation of the "96 Coordination" to oppose HR 2202.<p>
The major new entry in the coalition against immigration reform are high
technology businesses<b> --</b> they want to easily bring immigrant and
non-immigrant professionals to the US.  Microsoft, for example, asserts that
1,000 positions remained vacant in 1994 because the company could not find
qualified workers.<p>
Libertarian admissionists such as Wall Street Journal columnist Paul Gigot
attacked immigration reform on September 29, 1995 because of the national
registry. <b> </b>Under Congressional plans, US employers would supply the name
and Social Security number of each new hire, and then be informed if that
worker was legally authorized to work in the US.<p>
Gigot and other Libertarians characterize the registry as an attempt to
deputize US employers as immigration agents.  They point out the potential for
error. With an estimated 65 million hires each year, including first entrants
and persons who change jobs, there may be millions of times in which
individuals are denied jobs because of government computer errors.<p>
Another Libertarian,<b> </b>Glenn Garvin in Reason magazine, asserts that
President Reagan in the early 1980s followed the advice of domestic policy
advisor Martin Anderson, rather than accepting that of Attorney General William
French Smith to explore the development of a work authorization system.
According to Garvin, the INS currently has a 19 percent error rate in a pilot
program under which employers submit the A- or immigration numbers of non-US
citizens to verify their right to work in the US.  <p>
If there is a 19 percent error rate<b> </b>in a national registry --sometime
after the year 2000-- errors could cause severe inconvenience for over 12
million of the 65 million new hires each year.  Supporters of immigration
reform assert that the error rate would decline with experience.<p>
Restrictionists such as FAIR, Carrying Capacity Network, and some state
chapters of Ross Perot's United We Stand Organization argue that HR 2202 does
not go far enough to reduce legal and illegal immigration.  CCN has called for
a moratorium on immigration, permitting a maximum of 100,000 immigrants per
year to enter, including 70,000 spouses and children of US citizens, 5,000
priority workers, and 25,000 refugees. <p>
Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) will soon introduce a bill patterned after the
House version.<b>  </b>Simpson's bill would reduce the number of immigrants
admitted for economic/employment reasons from 140,000 to 75,000, require US
employers to pay permanent immigrants admitted to fill vacant US jobs at least
10 percent more than the prevailing wage, and to also pay 30 percent of the
first year's salary paid to the immigrant into a US fund dedicated to training
US workers to fill vacant jobs.<p>
Foreign-born persons were about 12 percent of the scientists and engineers in
the US in 1990, and up to half of all persons earning PhDs from US universities
in fields such as computer science were born abroad.  Even though foreign-born
engineers are typically less than five percent of the engineers at computer
companies such as Microsoft and Sun, these companies insist that they need the
foreigners to remain competitive.<p>

The House and Senate in October approved budget proposals for FY96, that began
October 1, 1995, that are projected to reduce federal spending by about $1
trillion over seven years.  Over one-third of these projected savings come from
changes in the federal medical program for older residents, Medicare, and in
the federal-state program that provides health care for poor residents,
Medicaid.<p>
About 10 percent of the projected savings come from changes in federal welfare
programs.  The federal government will make "block grants" to states, and
states will in turn have more discretion to decide who gets cash and other
assistance and how much recipients get.  Most aid to non-US citizens is either
banned, or limited to five years.<p>
The exclusion of immigrants from many welfare programs reflects the addition of
a third question to two classic questions about newcomers--to the questions of
how well do immigrants integrate and what impacts do immigrants have on the US
economy and society, the question of do immigrants pay their way in the welfare
state has loomed large in the 1990s.<p>
At one level, it would seem that the concerns about immigrants and welfare are
misplaced.  In 1970, about six percent of all households headed by a
native-born person received some form of cash assistance in 1969, and this
welfare rate for natives rose to eight percent in 1980, and was seven percent
in 1990.<p>
About six percent of the households headed by foreign-born persons reported
receiving cash assistance in the 1970 Census.  The share of foreign-born
households receiving foreign assistance rose to nine percent in 1980, and
remained at nine percent in 1990.  <p>
However, cash assistance accounts for only about one-fourth of the roughly $180
billion in federal expenditures for poor residents in 1990.  Data from the
Survey of Income and Program (SIPP) participation, which follows households for
32 months, suggest that the gap between households headed by a foreign-born
person, and households headed by a native-born person, is larger for non-cash
assistance such as Medicaid and food stamps than for cash assistance such as
AFDC.<p>
For example, in 1990, SIPP<b> </b>data indicate that about eight percent of all
households headed by a native-born person received in-kind federal assistance,
versus 21 percent of households headed by a foreign-born person.  In
California, about 14 percent of households headed by a US-born person, and 40
percent of households headed by foreign-born persons, received federal in-kind
benefits.<p>
Analysis of these data by George Borjas of Harvard suggests that the gap is
widening for more recent arrivals, leading him to conclude that immigrants are
"assimilating into welfare."  Borjas also believes that, once immigrants begin
obtaining cash and in-kind federal assistance, they stay on the welfare rolls
longer than native-born recipients, a tendency he attributes in part to their
relatively low educational level.  <p>
If current trends continue, Borjas believes that, in California, the welfare
population will increasingly be an immigrant population.<p>
Medicaid is the most expensive in-kind program that provides benefits to poor
people, including immigrants, accounting for about half of federal welfare
expenditures in 1990.  Medicaid reform pending in Congress would eliminate the
requirement that states help to pay for the cost of emergency medical care for
unauthorized immigrants.  Under current law, the federal and state governments
share 50-50 the cost of providing health care to poor people, including
unauthorized immigrants.  <p>
For California, this means that, in FY95, the state and federal governments
will each spend about $414 million to cover the cost of emergency health care
for unauthorized aliens.  House Speaker Gingrich on October 20 indicated that
states with large numbers of illegal aliens would receive funds to cover their
costs of providing emergency care for illegal aliens--some  $6 billion
nationwide over seven years, or $400 million per year to California.<p>
Instead of paying Medicaid bills on a 50-50 basis after they are submitted by
health care providers, the federal government would make block grants to the
states, and they could--but would not have to--use some of their block grant to
provide emergency health care to unauthorized aliens.  However, the block grant
will be about 25 percent less than projected federal spending.<p>
The California Senate Office of Research released a report on October 11 that
concluded<b> </b>that federal welfare and health care reforms would eliminate
federal help for 500,000 of the state's four million legal immigrants who are
not US citizens, costing California $6 to $7 billion over five years.  Under
legislation pending in Congress, non-citizens now getting SSI would lose their
payments beginning on January 1, 1997.<p>
In California, counties are the providers of last resort, required to offer
services to poor people regardless of legal status.  An effort may be made to
copy the Congress and refuse to provide benefits to non-US citizens, but such a
measure might be held unconstitutional under the California and US
Constitutions.<p>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on
Immigration Reform, offered an amendment to HR 2202 that would prevent parents
who are illegal aliens from accepting federal benefits, except for medical care
and child nutrition benefits, on behalf of their US citizen children.<p>
On October 25, Gallegly introduced a new study by Donald Huddle that argues
that the 22 million legal and illegal immigrants who settled in the US since
1970 imposed costs on the US that were $51 billion larger than the taxes they
paid.  This would imply that each immigrant, on average, generated costs that
were $2,300 greater than revenues.  <p>
The Urban Institute and other studies dispute these cost-revenue estimates,
finding that immigrants pay more in taxes than they cost in taxes, and that the
cost-benefit ratio shifts in favor of US residents the longer immigrants remain
in the US. <p>
George Borjas estimated that the net benefits from immigration to the US are
about $7 billion per year, or about one-tenth of one percent of the $7 trillion
US GDP.  <p>

On October 1, 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper--a system to prevent
illegal entry by deterring aliens from attempting to enter the US with fences,
lights, and three lines of agents-- on the US-Mexican border south of San
Diego.<p>
Attorney General Reno announced in mid-October, 1995 that the US Attorney for
San Diego, Alan Bersin, would be a "border czar" responsible for coordinating
US law enforcement efforts along the 2,000 mile US-Mexican border.  The INS
will open its first-ever courts at the port of entry, and prosecute
smugglers.<p>
In 1995, the INS has prosecuted 1,039 illegal immigrants for "felonious illegal
entry," more than in the previous nine years combined.  Most of those charged
are persons with criminal records in the US attempting to reenter the US
illegally.  To hold them in jail until their trials, Reno announced that the US
Navy had agreed to make space available in its San Diego brig.<p>
Reno also announced that the INS would<b> </b>crack down on US employers who
hire illegal aliens, presumably by adding investigators to do more workplace
inspections.<p>
As illegal immigrants attempting entry shift from the westernmost section of
the border further east, homeowners in what were previously isolated areas have
in a few instances taken vigilante action against them in retaliation for
cutting fences etc.  Several cases of homeowners beating aliens are under
investigation.<p>
In mid-October, six New Jersey police officers who removed foreigners from a
private detention camp in June after they rioted to protest mistreatment were
charged with abusing the asylum seekers while transferring them to a local jail
(Migration News, July 1995).  An investigation suggests that the police beat
the foreigners, and made them chant "America is number one."<p>

In October 1995, the 32,000 machinists at the Boeing Company's US factories
went on strike, in part to protest Boeing plans to move some skilled jobs
overseas in order to win plane orders from certain foreign airlines.  The
complaints of Boeing workers, who earn an average $20 per hour or $3,500 per
month, include fears that US workers are cooperating in the export of their
jobs by training replacements who come to Seattle to learn how to do their
jobs.<p>
Boeing counters that, in order to win airplane orders from countries such as
China, it must subcontract the production of components to China.  Chinese
aerospace workers earn 1,000 yuan per month, or $120.<p>
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said that the Boeing workers have legitimate
complaints, and the Department of Labor is working to tighten the system that
permits non-immigrant foreign workers to enter the US.  In addition to
aerospace machinists, other skilled jobs that are gradually moving overseas
include computer programmers, physical therapists and cinematographers.  <p>
Many skilled US workers are astonished to learn that foreigners can come to the
US from India or the Philippines, learn their jobs, and then the company can
shift those jobs without penalty to the newly trained workers abroad.  US
employers are not required to justify shifting jobs overseas, or to retrain
laid-off US workers. <p>
In many cases, skilled foreigners in the US receive less than US prevailing
wages.  For example, DOL found many cases of foreign physical therapists
earning much less than prevailing US wages--in one case, 54 therapists were
receiving $500 a month in wages, compared with the prevailing US wage of
$2,800.  Foreign technicians working in the US for "half pay" have reportedly
been employed on 200 US films so far in 1995.<p>
US employer groups are resisting any tightening of laws and regulations that
govern the entry of non-immigrant foreigners.  A common assertion is that the
world's supply of brilliant workers is limited, and to remain at the forefront
of global competition, US employers need access to the world's best brains, as
defined by employers.<p>
Some employers in the electronics industry lobbied Congress to relax rules
governing the admission of professional foreign workers under the H-1B program.
In the computer industry, occupations often filled by H-1B foreign workers are
programmers--about one-fourth of all such workers--and engineers.<p>
In January, 1995, DOL issued regulations that require close monitoring of an
H-1B worker's activities and repeated written notification of the worker's
status and salary to his or her colleagues.  Some US employers are trying to
get this tougher enforcement relaxed, asserting that tight enforcement will
make the H-1B program "unworkable."  A maximum of 65,000 H-1B workers can enter
the US each year, but each can remain up to six years, so that the program can
permit up to 390,000 skilled foreign workers to be employed in the US at any
one time.<p>
Reich continued to put pressure on US retailers who buy clothes from some of
the 20,000 US sewing shops, employing 800,000 workers, that supply about half
of US garments. <b> </b>Many of these shops employ unauthorized workers.
According to some sources, DOL plans to step up its raids in the next few
months, and to announce the names of retailers whose labels are found in the
sewing shops.  DOL has 816 inspectors to enforce federal labor laws in about
6.5 million US firms that employ about 110 million workers.<p>
In the continuing debate over the economic benefits and costs of immigration,
the home-building industry released data that suggests about half of all
immigrant households own their homes, so that immigration adds jobs in the
currently one million strong home construction work force, where earnings
average $13 per hour.<p>

Pending</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
One year after its approval by a vote of 59 to 41 percent, California's Prop.
187 remains tied up in court.<p>
There are two distinct cases pending.  Sections 7 and 8, which prohibit illegal
aliens<b> </b>from obtaining tuition-free public education, is being challenged
in a San Francisco state court by opponents who assert that the denial of free
K-12 education to illegal alien children violates the California constitution's
equal protection clause.  Many observers expect the judge to strike down these
sections.<p>
A second case is pending in federal court in Los Angeles.  All sections of
Prop. 187 are being challenged there as an unlawful effort by California voters
to regulate immigration, which is solely a federal responsibility.  The state
of California is defending Prop. 187 on the grounds that it has the right and
responsibility to allocate its limited resources to provide services to those
voters deem most deserving.<p>
On October 23, the federal judge in Los Angeles indefinitely postponed a
decision on whether some parts of Prop. 187 can take effect even if other
sections are found to be unconstitutional.  Opponents of Prop. 187, including
state-paid attorneys representing the elected State Superintendent of
Education, are arguing that the initiative should be declared unconstitutional
because it is a state effort to interfere with federal immigration policy.<p>
If the Prop. 187 case goes to trial, social science research may take center
stage, much as it did in the 1954 US Supreme Court that ended "separate but
equal" schools for blacks and whites.  Among the issues to be resolved are
questions such as the role of benefits and services in attracting illegal
immigrants and their families to California, or encouraging them to stay, the
impacts of illegal immigrants on US citizen and legal immigrant workers, and
the effects of denying services to illegal immigrants on the quantity and
quality of services available to other state residents.  <p>
For example, if illegal immigrant children were denied K-12 public education
services, California might argue that, given other propositions approved by
voters, implementing Prop. 187 might increase the funds available for K-12
education by five percent, or $1 billion over three to five years.<p>
In Hispanic commentary on the Million Man March, it was noted that the largest
demonstration staged in the US by Hispanics involved 70,000 opponents of Prop.
187 in Los Angeles in October 1994.<p>
In Sacramento, a law pushed by Democrats to head off Prop. 187 has led to
protests from some immigrants.  In 1993, California enacted a law that required
applicants for drivers' licenses to prove that they are legal residents.  The
law was interpreted to make the validity of drivers' licenses coincide with the
length of time the INS permits a foreigner to be in the US.  But visas are
often renewed, forcing Japanese businessmen and foreign students to renew their
drivers' licenses several times, and generating complaints from them about the
time and expense involved .<p>
A California poll found that 55 percent of the state's residents were
"extremely concerned" about illegal immigration, versus about 75 percent who
were concerned about AIDS, public schools, and crime.<p>

On October 10, Mexican President Zedillo came to Washington, where he repaid
ahead of schedule $700 million of the $12.5 billion Mexico borrowed from the US
in March 1995.  The US made available up to $20 billion to Mexico, part of a
$50 billion international loan package.<p>
The meeting included an announcement that, in order to discourage illegal
Mexican entrants from attempting to re-enter the US,  the federal government
would pay to return up to 10,000 apprehended aliens to their homes in the
interior of Mexico, instead of merely taking them across the border.  Mexico
also announced on October 27, that it plans to increase Mexican agents along
the border to protect migrants from being victimized by smugglers and thieves.
The Mexican agents will not try to prevent the migrants from illegally crossing
the border into the US.<p>
Before Zedillo's arrival, the Mexican ambassador to the US on October 4 decried
the "demagoguery" of American presidential candidates who he said are trying to
attract votes by pandering to voter fears of unstoppable waves of illegal
Mexican migrants.<p>
According to Amb. Silva-Herzog, Americans ignore the "economic benefits" of
Mexican immigrants in the US.  For example, he said, since most California farm
workers are Mexican immigrants, "what would happen if that flow of workers
would be interrupted?"  A North Carolina grower told Silva-Herzog that, without
Mexican workers, he "would be out of business."<p>
Silva-Herzog said that the number one security problem facing Mexico are drug
cartels, which are now capable of landing commercial jets in Mexico filled with
cocaine.<p>
Mexican President Zedillo's October 10 visit to Washington prompted reviews of
NAFTA 21 months after enactment.  NAFTA linked the Mexican economy to the US,
and promised economic benefits to both countries.  In urging Congressional
approval of NAFTA in November 1993, the Clinton Administration predicted that
NAFTA would lead to the creation of a net 170,000 US jobs in its first full
year, 1994.  <p>
Most commentaries noted that NAFTA has not created many net new jobs, in the US
or Mexico, in part because of the peso crisis of December 1994 and the
subsequent recession in Mexico.  In the US, the DOL has certified that 42,000
US workers lost their jobs due to NAFTA-related imports since January
1994--21,500 of these workers are drawing special unemployment benefits from
DOL.  Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics estimates
that, since NAFTA went into effect, the US lost 225,000 trade-related jobs.<p>
The Clinton Administration argues that exports to Mexico and Canada created
340,000 new jobs since January 1, 1994.<p>
NAFTA sharply divided US public opinion and the US Congress.  Most supporters
of NAFTA point to signs that NAFTA is working, increasing the efficiency of,
for example, auto plants on both sides of the border, as factories specialize
in one model for a bigger market, rather than producing several models.  In
other instances, US jobs that would probably otherwise have gone to Asia went
to Mexico, which increases the likelihood that US workers will produce parts
for the Mexican plants.<p>
NAFTA illustrates how freer trade produces winners and losers, and the losers
tend to be more vocal and visible than the winners.  <p>
In Mexico, the first new "pacto" in 10 months was announced in late October.
The pactos are agreements between government, unions, and businesses that
include growth, inflation and wage targets.  The pacto envisions economic
growth of three percent in 1996, 20 percent inflation, and two-ten percent
hikes in the minimum wage.<p>
In Mexico, manufacturing employment has dropped every month since September
1990, and one million Mexicans lost their jobs in 1995, especially as large
companies streamlined their operations to become globally competitive.  In
rural Mexico, over two-thirds of the farmers questioned in one survey reported
that their incomes had been reduced by a NAFTA-induced influx of corn,
processed meat and milk products that lowered the prices they received for farm
products in Mexico.<p>
The maquiladora industry is booming--employment rose 100,000 or 20 percent
since January 1, 1994, and today tops 600,000.  Maquildora wages fell as a
result of the peso devaluation--from an average $2.54 per hour, including
benefits, to $1.80 hourly-- many workers take home $25 to $45 per week.<p>
Mexican horticultural exports to the US rose about 30 percent in the first half
of 1995 versus 1994, enabling producers who had planted tomatoes in Fall 1994
expecting a $1=3.5 peso exchange rate to reap windfall profits.  But profits
were restrained by the fact that many costs of producing fruits and vegetables
for the US are in dollars.<p>
In a few cases, NAFTA increased US production for the Mexican market in a
manner that increased the US demand for Mexican workers.  Several large US
vegetable growers, for example, moved production from Mexico to California,
finding that they could supply the Mexican market at lower cost from California
than from Mexico.  Since Mexican workers pick most of the produce on both sides
of the border, this raised the US demand for Mexican workers, possibly
increasing illegal immigration.<p>
As a result of Operation Gatekeeper, more immigrants are attempting to enter
the US illegally at the port of entry.  A few have simply rushed the border,
attempting to run or drive past inspection stations.  But most are attempting
to pass themselves off as US citizens or legal immigrants--the number of
persons who were detected attempting to enter the US using fraudulent documents
rose 44 percent in 1995 versus year-earlier levels.  <p>
Women and children are now more likely to try to enter the US illegally with
false documents or by being smuggled in vehicles, so that they can avoid
crossing at night through the canyons.  US officials complain that Mexico
permits smugglers selling documents to operate openly near the border,
including Mexican police who have been seen giving false documents to motorists
waiting to cross.<p>
In Mexico, the outlook for jobs is mixed.  Banamex estimates that a two percent
increase in real GDP growth has been associated with a one percent increase in
paid employment in Mexico since 1980.  There were a net 1.6 million paid jobs
created in Mexico between 1988 and 1994--the total number of paid jobs rose
from 22.1 million to 23.7 million (Banamex, July 1995, 244)<p>
Over these years, Mexico's population rose from 78.4 million to 90.5 million,
and its economically active population rose from 28.9 million to 35.4 million
(persons 12 and older engaged in productive activity or seeking work).  Another
measure of the gap between labor force and job growth can be found in Mexican
Social Security Institute IMSS data--the number of permanent and temporary
beneficiaries rose from 8.3 million in 1988 to 10 million in 1994. <p>
Some 950,000 additional persons are expected to become economically active in
1995, a year in which economic growth is expected to drop by over five percent,
and the number of paid jobs by over one million.<p>
Mexico is experiencing a "silent revolution" as "tens of thousands" of peasant
families move to Mexico City and northern industrial cities. Many of the new
migrants are moving directly to northern border states, where they can find
work as grape- or orange-pickers, and from there move on to the United States.
<p>
In Mexico City, rural-urban migrants are sometimes forced to sleep on the
streets and make a living selling chewing gum to motorists, washing windshields
or begging.  In some instances, the migrants work at night to avoid extortion
by the police; in September 1995, thousands of mostly Indian street-vendors
were banned from the city's central Zocalo square.<p>
According to the College of the Northern Frontier, more than half of all
undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States come from the central and
southern states of Michoacan, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Zacatecas and Oaxaca--an
estimated 1.8 million Mexicans moved north in 1994, and 800,000 entered the
US.<p>

There is a significant amount of migration within Central and Latin America.
Peruvians are found in Mexico and Mexicans in Canada.  NAFTA has removed trade
barriers and many of the psychological barriers to<b> </b>moving across
borders.  <p>
At a seminar on immigration attended in October by immigration officials from
various Central American nations, the participants agreed that to halt
immigration, countries need to impose harsher fines on traffickers.<p>
Some Latin Americas countries have decided to take measures to curb
immigration.  Argentina and Chile, which have traditionally welcomed
immigrants, are closing the door as unemployment rises in their countries.
Nearly one million Paraguayans and Peruvians are reported to live illegally in
Argentina. <p>
Police in Buenos Aires have been raiding buildings where illegal immigrants are
squatting.  The Argentine government is also trying to stop "false tourists" at
the Bolivian and Brazilian borders. <p>
In a meeting in Mexico on September 20, the foreign ministers of El Salvador
and Mexico recommended creating a commission to propose measures to protect
Latin Americans who suffer discrimination in the US because of Prop. 187.<p>
The Nicaraguan government estimates that every day about 200 aliens, primarily
from Peru, Ecuador, India and China transit through the country without visas
on their way to the US.  Only one percent are captured by authorities.  <p>
An estimated 175,000 Nicaraguans migrate to Costa Rica every year to harvest
sugar cane and coffee and, in 1995, Costa Rican employers will issue them
six-month work permits that guarantee "a decent salary and social security
contributions."  The Costa Rican government, complaining of welfare costs,
recently began deporting Nicaraguans, which led to tensions because many
Nicaraguans are unemployed as a result of a wave of strikes there.<p>
In April, it was disclosed that Honduran government officials accepted $450
million to naturalize illegally about 18,000 Russians, Chinese, Iranian and
nationals of other countries.  The officials collected about $25,000 per person
for Honduran passports, ID cards and naturalization papers.  <p>
"200 illegal aliens head from Nicaragua for US per day," Xinhua News Agency,

<a name="RTFToC10">British
Immigration Reform</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
An Immigration and Asylum Bill that strengthens immigration controls and makes
it harder for asylum applicants to settle in the UK is expected to be included
in the Queen's Speech to Parliament on November 15--the speech is Prime
Minister John Major's legislative plan for 1996.  The proposed controls include
a measures to stop income support payments, council tax benefits, housing
benefits, family credits and medical treatment to those who have been denied
asylum.<p>
There are about 50,000 to 60,000 legal immigrants to the UK annually.  There
were 33,000 asylum applicants in the UK in 1994, and a backlog of 70,000 asylum
applicants.  The estimated number of illegal aliens ranges from 25,000 to 1
million.<p>
The Home Office obtained Cabinet approval to include penalties on employers in
Britain's immigration control system.  The Labour Party has opposed the
proposal because they believe it would increase racial discrimination.
Immigrant and business organizations, including the Confederation of British
Industry, oppose the idea because it would force businesses to verify an
immigrant employee's legal status. <p>
The spread of temporary employment agencies has made it easier for illegal
workers to find jobs.  Most employers check to ensure that workers have
National Insurance numbers, and then send them straight to cleaning or
restaurant jobs.<p>
Despite repeated denials by the Home Office, Howard confirmed on October 25
that he also plans to introduce as part of the Immigration and Asylum Act a
list of countries that are considered "safe" from political persecution, so
that applications from asylum-seekers from those countries can be fast tracked.
The Home Office scaled down the plan, which originally included 100 countries,
to a short trial list composed of Ghana, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Romania and Poland.  Since January 1995, over 6,000 from Nigeria and Sri Lanka,
have applied for asylum in Britain.  Downing Street continues to deny knowledge
of the existence of the list. <p>
Human rights organizations say that such a list would be a violation of the
1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, which requires signatories to treat
every application for political asylum--wherever it comes from--on its
individual merit. <p>
Opposition Labour Party leaders claim that in offering the reported new
proposals, the government was "playing the race card" in order to gain votes.
<p>
British officials report that over 100 immigrants per day have claimed
political asylum in 1995.  If this rate continues, it will be a 46 percent
increase over 1993.  Government officials say that the increase of asylum
seekers is due to the perception that Britain is a "soft touch," offering
liberal welfare benefits which continue throughout the appeal process.  The
immigration department estimates that each asylum seeker cost the taxpayer L100
per week in income support and housing benefits.<p>
Former Minister of Immigration Nicholas Baker wrote in an article appearing in
a British newspaper that Britain acts a magnet to asylum-seekers fleeing
extremely poor countries and that the asylum process is being overrun by bogus
asylum claims.  He called for urgent action to halt the flows by strengthening
asylum controls as Germany did,  resulting in significant decreases in the
number of asylum seekers.<p>

A mayor in southern France has asked the government for permission to prevent
immigrants from settling in his city.  The city council of Beaucaire, in the
Gard region of southern France, passed a resolution demanding that Paris
designate the Gard region as off-limits to all new immigrants, both those
coming from other countries and those who are moving to Gard from other parts
of France.  The mayor of Beaucaire has refused to register the children of
foreigners in local schools.   <p>
Although racist language is illegal in France, a member of the Regional Council
in Toulon says the National Front substitutes the word "immigration" for "North
African", using anti-foreign prejudices to create the image of a white race
under threat by outside forces.  The National Front argues that it wants curbs
on immigration, not restrictions on the immigrants themselves.<p>
On October 17, the eighth bomb exploded in what may be a terrorist campaign to
protest France's support of the current Algerian government, who canceled a
1992 election that the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.  In
September, French police killed an Algerian immigrant suspected of planting an
earlier bomb.<p>

Under pressure from the Northern League and the Democratic Party of the Left
(PDS), Italy's biggest party, Italy's coalition government in mid-October
agreed to crack down on criminal illegal aliens. <p>
The draft law in the Italian Parliament includes provisions that would
immediately expel illegal immigrants; an identity card for workers with
permits; a certificate from the country of origin testifying that the foreigner
has not spent longer than 30 days in prison for any crime; the introduction of
a new offense-- trafficking in immigrants, carrying a sentence of up to 15
years; heavy sanctions penalizing those employing illegal labor; delaying the
entry of family members until an foreign worker has been employed two years and
demonstrated that they can be supported.  <p>
The bill will be amended to include an amnesty for some illegal aliens,
accelerated procedures for deporting criminal aliens, and an immigration system
that permits the unification of families in Italy.<p>
If the controls are introduced, the government believes that an estimated
60,000 illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Brazil will be
expelled. <p>
Italy's 1986 and 1990 immigration laws were adopted as emergency measures and,
after a rape committed by two Romanians in daylight in early October prompted
calls to enact the 1995 crackdown as an emergency measure.<p>
Caritas estimates that there were 922,000 legally registered immigrants in
Italy in 1994--37 percent came from Europe, 25 percent from Asia, 19 percent
from Africa, and 18 percent from the Americas.  Legal immigrants in the work
force are mostly maids-60 percent--or in the public sector--18 percent--or in
agriculture--16 percent.<p>
A member of the right-wing National Alliance has demanded an investigation of
the community aid program that gives money to non-EU immigrants.  The National
Alliance wants to halt the distribution of if it is being given to illegal
immigrants.  <p>
North Africans have been brought in to Italy as seasonal agricultural workers
on permit.  Many stay in Italy because they are afraid that if they leave, they
cannot return.  Italy reported that 21,500 foreigners were employed temporarily
in agriculture in 1994, up from 17,000 in 1993.  Another 30,000 are believed to
be working illegally in Italian agriculture.<p>
Expulsion procedures allow 14 days to elapse between a court order and its
execution, except in the case of serious crimes. This permits the poorly
surveyed illegals to destroy documents and disappear. Thus, of 60,000 expulsion
orders issued last year no more than 12,000 were carried out.<p>

</a></h2>
Many Czech companies are complaining of labor shortages, prompting some,
including electrical equipment plants, to bring in foreign workers.  Prague,
with an unemployment rate of just one percent, is a particularly hard place to
find workers.  A new automobile plant on the outskirts of the capital city says
it is having a hard time finding skilled workers.  <p>
Housing presents another problem.  Workers who are laid off cannot move to
another area because of a severe lack of housing.  The government approved a
plan to subsidize mortgages to relieve the housing crisis. <p>
There are an estimated 45,000 legal foreign workers, and an unknown number of
illegal workers.  Apprehensions of illegal foreign workers have been on the
rise.  <p>
In 1993, 750 foreigners without proper permits were expelled.   In 1994, some
982 were apprehended.  Between January and October, 1995, some 1,025 foreigners
working illegally in the Czech Republic were expelled.  According to the Czech
Interior Ministry, most of the illegal foreign workers are Ukrainians in the
construction industry.  Czech construction companies are said to earn large
profits because of low labor costs, and nonpayment of taxes and insurance.<p>
The Labor Office inspects companies for illegal workers every six months, and
the police foreign department inspects more often.  Foreign workers without a
work permit can be banned form the Czech Republic for one year.  Employers
found employing workers without residence or work permits are fined between
$9,600 and $38,500. <p>

</a></h2>
Joerg Haider, leader of the Freedom Party, in mid-October called for Austria's
562,000 immigrants to be repatriated so that they could be "reunited with their
families." Elections are scheduled for December 17, and the Freedom Party is
expected to get between 27 and 30 percent of the votes, which may enable the
Freedom Party to join a coalition government.<p>
There are believed to be 100,000 unauthorized immigrants in Austria.  Haider
demands tough laws to free the country of illegal immigrants,  wants to empower
the police to make systematic identity checks and has suggested using air force
planes to fly  foreigners  back to their country of origin.  Haider's biggest
appeal though, is to those who are tired of the cronyism propagated by the
Social Democrats and People's Party that has governed the country since 1945.
<p>
Some observers argue that although many fear the resurgence of the right wing,
the rise of the multi-party system in countries such as Austria and Italy, is
necessary to strengthen democracy.  And, they say, the far right parties will
only win a small share of the power. <p>
Two letter bombs exploded in separate incidents on October 16, injuring an
Iranian-born doctor and a social worker who deals with immigration.  A letter
bomb sent to a South Korean-born doctor was deactivated prior to explosion.
The attacks are similar to a series of letter bombs sent in 1993 to people
involved in immigration. <p>

The Dutch city of Rotterdam, where nearly a quarter of the residents are
foreign, is offering $16,000 to each immigrant who returns home to start a
business.  The city government will also pay for a return ticket if the
immigrant fails in his/her native land. <p>
There are 30,000 immigrants from Morocco, 50,000 from the former Dutch colony
of Surinam and 15,000 from the Cape Verde Islands in Rotterdam.<p>
Dutch government auditors call the country's asylum policy insufficient because
there is a backlog of nearly 50,000 applications from asylum seekers hoping to
settle in the Netherlands.  A 1994 legislative amendment to reduce the number
of immigrants seeking asylum and reducing the processing time has not had the
intended effect, according to the Regional Planning Bureau in a report issued
on October 5.<p>
The report indicates that part of the reason for the long processing time,
typically about 11 months, was delays in the exchange of information between
Immigration and Naturalization Services, and the office in charge of housing
refugees. <p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Hong
Kong</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>to
Reduce Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
In mid-October, Hong Kong cut its foreign worker quota from 25,000 to 5,000
because of an unemployment rate that hit a 10-year high of 3.5 percent of the
2.7 million strong labor force, or 105,000.  Not content with this reduction,
six members of the Hong Kong legislature hope to pass a bill that would halt
all importation of workers.  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has said he will
veto the bill if it is passed.  Hong Kong began to import foreign workers in
1989 because of labor shortages.<p>
Unions welcomed the move, and employers criticized it.  The maximum 17,000
foreign workers employed on the new airport are exempted, as are the 1,000
Chinese professionals allowed to work in Hong Kong.<p>
There are now 19,062 foreign workers employed in Hong Kong--including 3,500 as
cooks and waiters--plus 3,509 foreign airport workers, and 203 Chinese
professionals.<p>
There are also about 130,000 foreign maids in Hong Kong.  The Immigration
Department is reportedly considering the issuance of a special identity card
for maids, so that they do not move from household work to stores and
factories, and requiring all foreign workers to surrender their identity cards
upon their departure to help prevent their use by illegal immigrants.  The
Asian Domestic Workers' Union, which represents maids, has been organizing
demonstrations in support of an increase in the minimum wage for maids.<p>
Beginning January 1, 1996, Hong Kong employers wishing to employ foreign
workers will have to prove that local workers are not available by registering
their vacancies with the local Employment Service office and advertising for at
least two months for local workers.<p>
Emigration has averaged over 60,000 per year since 1990, up sharply from 20,000
annually in the early 1980s.  An estimated 500,000 of Hong Kong's 6.5 million
people have passports that would allow them to emigrate.  In 1994, some 43,400
Hong Kong residents emigrated to Canada. <p>
Polls suggest that almost half of all Hong Kong residents may have or develop
the means to emigrate; 35 percent of Hong Kong residents are related to someone
living abroad.<p>
Several countries are attempting to encourage at least some Hong Kong residents
to emigrate.  Some 40,000 Hong Kong residents have the right to immigrate to
Singapore, although only 6,500 have moved.<p>
There continues to be debate over the fate of 3.3 million residents who are
considered British Dependent Territory Citizens and not entitled to immigrate
to the UK.  The British Parliament has refused to consider permitting more than
50,000 Hong Kong heads of households to immigrate, leaving an unknown fate for
some Hong Kong residents, such as East Asians, who will not automatically be
entitled to either Chinese or British citizenship.  <p>
Despite heavy lobbying by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, the British
government is not expected to yield on this matter because of the government's
concern with reducing immigration (see story on British Immigration Reform in
this issue). <p>
Chinese law currently permits non-Chinese to acquire Chinese nationality only
if the meet one of the following criteria: 1) they are close relatives of
Chinese nationals; 2) they settle in China or 3) they have other valid reasons.
Many ethnic minorities may meet the criteria of having lived in Hong Kong for
many years, but most non-Chinese living in Hong Kong do not want Chinese
nationality.<p>
The number of Chinese allowed to immigrate to Hong Kong increased in 1995 from
105 to 150 pre day.  Increasing, Chinese mainlanders are finding that Hong Kong
is not the economic heaven they envisioned.  Many mainlanders with high level
education find that they must take lower status jobs when they move to Hong
Kong.  The language barrier also makes it more difficult to find adequate
employment.  Mainlanders must also make do with small apartments because of the
expense of housing in Hong Kong. <p>
The Hong Kong governor acknowledged that the transition from the mainland to
the territory is not easy and that the government should help provide a smother
integration.  Many mainlanders are not aware that there are social services
available for them. <p>
Portugal is turning Macao over to China in 1999, and offering 100,000 of the
467,000 residents the right to immigrate to Portugal.<p>
On October 24, 84 Vietnamese spent nine hours on the tarmac at Hanoi Airport,
refusing to disembark from a forced repatriation flight.  Finally, the
Vietnamese consented to get off the plane with the assistance of uniformed
Vietnamese immigration police.  Observes say that some of those being forcible
repatriated had to be restrained when they were being placed on the plane in
Hong Kong.  <p>
Hong Kong is under pressure from China to repatriate the 20,000 boat people
before 1997. Since 1989, more than 45,000 have returned to Vietnam.<p>

Migrant Workers and Growth in

</a></h2>
Estimates of the number of migrant workers in Asia range from two million to 13
million.  Whatever the exact amount, the number of migrants is up sharply from
100,000 in the early 1970s.  <p>
Many of the migrant receiving countries do not regard themselves as
"immigration countries," encouraging them to see migrant workers as trainees
and students or to tolerate the presence of illegal workers.  The Migrant Forum
in Asia, a coalition of 50 support groups, asserts that the major problems of
migrants flow from the inability of host countries to decide what role migrants
will play in their societies and economies.<p>
Labor-importing governments are reluctant to acknowledge any long-term need for
foreign workers and to make plans for the immigration, and possibly
integration, of foreigners.  For this reason, the legal status of foreign
workers is often unclear, and there are more announcements of new drives to
curb illegal immigration than there are of bilateral labor agreements.<p>
Many fast-growing labor importers fear being swamped by immigrants from
populous nearby nations.  Unlike North America and Western Europe, in Asia
labor importers are typically dwarfed in size by labor exporters--there are
about 10 Chinese for each Japanese, and 10 Indonesians for each Malay.  This
means that some Japanese and Malaysians see immigration that may get out of
control as a national security threat.<p>
Labor-exporting countries are increasingly concerned about the treatment of
their nationals abroad.  As a result of capital punishment being meted out to
migrant workers from the Philippines and Thailand, most governments have agreed
not to permit workers under 25 to emigrate or to immigrate.  However, it has
proven very difficult to enforce age limits--Malaysian and Filipinos reportedly
complained when it was proposed that only women 35 or older could be maids in
Malaysia.<p>
There is some dispute about the sustainability of fast growth in East Asia.
The Fall 1994 issue of Foreign Affairs carried an article by Paul Krugman
entitled "The Myth of Asia's Miracle," which argued that many of the
fast-growing Asian economies grew by adding labor and capital, but not by
increasing total factor productivity, or the increased output that results from
using scarce resources more effectively.  <p>
In other words, according to Krugman, Asian economies grew fast because they
mobilized resources, Stalinist style--they did not work smarter, which, Krugman
argues, is the only way to achieve rapid growth in the long run.<p>
Since TFP is the residual factor that explains economic growth, after measures
of labor and capital, much of the argument about Krugman's thesis that Asia has
experienced little growth in TFP hinges on how labor, capital, and thus TFP are
measured.  Asia is expected to have higher growth rates than the US and Europe
in the decades ahead, due mostly to rising education levels and high savings
rates, but the "Asian edge" in growth may be only one or two percent rather
than three or four percent.<p>
A study of manufacturing productivity and compensation in the US and several
NICs showed that Korea narrowed the gap with the US fastest between 1970 and
1990--output per Korean worker rose from 22 percent of the US level to 45
percent.  In Mexico, labor productivity in manufacturing was about 30 percent
of US levels in both 1970 and 1990, and in the Philippines, it fell from 30 to
15 percent of US levels.<p>
Compensation rose relative to US levels in most NICS--in Korea, from 10 to 30
percent of US levels, and in the Philippines from 15 to 17 percent--due to
rising real wages and currency appreciation.  Only in Mexico did compensation
fall--from about 30 to 25 percent of US levels.<p>
This means that labor costs per unit of output rose in all the NICS studied
except Mexico.  The unit costs of manufacturing goods fell from US levels in
Mexico, but the US gained in relative efficiency compared to Asian NICs.  For
example, Korean unit labor costs rose from about 45 percent of US levels to 75
percent, and Philippine costs rose from 50 to 110 percent of US costs.<p>

Fights Illegal Workers, Increases Foreign

</a></h2>
Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs has launched an aggressive campaign to
enforce the nation's immigration laws against illegal foreign workers and their
employers.  As of September 1, 1995, almost 17,000 foreign workers who had
completed their work contracts had disappeared without leaving the island, and
12,000 remain in Taiwan, presumably working illegally.  The "runaways" included
11,000 Thais and 5,000 Filipinos.<p>
The National Police Administration plans to apprehend 1,000 illegal alien
workers each month, largely by offering police who arrest three illegal alien
workers cash awards.  Previously, police reportedly had little incentive to
apprehend illegal alien workers.<p>
According to Taiwan authorities, about seven percent or 1 in 14 foreign workers
have illegally broken their contracts, by not staying with their assigned
employers, or by not leaving Taiwan after the contracts expired.  About 220,000
foreign workers have been admitted to Taiwan since 1992.<p>
Despite this problem with illegal foreign workers, the Taiwan government plans
to allow in by the end of the year an additional 30,000 foreign nationals to
work in various manufacturing companies and factories.  This will be the
largest quota ever extended to the manufacturing sector by the Council of Labor
Affairs. <p>

Sees Rise in Illegal Alien
Employment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Singapore has about 300,000 foreign workers employed under one of the strictest
guest worker programs in the world, but illegal alien employment in Singapore
seems to be increasing, and authorities have stepped up their enforcement
efforts.<p>
In Singapore, two employers were jailed the first time they were found to have
hired illegal aliens--a construction employer who hired 18 foreign workers who
did not have work permits was sentenced to 26 weeks in jail--the illegal
foreign workers had been at work from one day to two months.<p>
First-time violators of Singapore's employer sanctions laws can be fined the
equivalent of two to four years of the foreign workers' levy, or be jailed up
to one year or both.  According to police, an average 41 employers per month
are prosecuted for hiring illegal alien workers.<p>
In Singapore, the construction industry can hire five foreigners for every
Singaporean employee.<p>
Even though controls are tight, illegal immigrants and overstayers made up more
than 17 per cent of the people arrested last year for committing crimes at
construction sites.  Some 1,065 foreigners were charged with committing crimes
in Singapore in the first half of 1995.<p>
The Singapore government in October announced that it would raise the
retirement age to 67 to avoid over-reliance on foreign workers.  According to
the government: "We are short of workers, and it is better for Singaporeans to
work longer than for us to rely more heavily on foreign workers.  Hence the
Government's long-term objective is to raise retirement age step by step to
67."  The retirement age was raised from 55 to 60 in 1993.<p>

China is the world's most populous country, with 1.2 billion residents, and one
of the fastest growing countries--growth averaged 10 percent or more since
1992.  Economic growth is very uneven within China--privately-owned businesses
in the five economic zones of the southeast and urban areas are growing
fastest--and an estimated 50 to 100 million internal migrants within China have
taken advantage of higher wages in the coastal areas and largest cities by
moving there, at least temporarily.<p>
China has about 180 million urban workers, and 450 million working age farmers.
Officially, 2.8 percent of China's urban workers are unemployed--about 95
million urban workers are covered by unemployment insurance-- and 130 to 150
million farmers are "surplus."<p>
Farmers are migrating to urban areas despite recent analyses that suggest urban
unemployment is far higher than three percent, making China's job creation
challenge formidable.  Recent estimates put the urban unemployment rate at 12
to 20 percent--20 percent unemployment would imply 35 million jobless urban
workers.  <p>
Over the next five years, China expects an average five million young workers
to enter the labor force each year, four million state workers to be laid off,
and 24 million farmers to head for the cities, so that about 30 million jobs
must be created annually to prevent unemployment from worsening.  If China
grows by 10 percent annually, there would be about 13 million new urban jobs
created each year.<p>
Many Chinese cities include large numbers of recently-arrived rural migrants.
For example, about 20 percent of Shanghai's 15 million residents are believed
to have arrived from rural areas within the past five years.<p>
Chinese cities have taken different approaches to dealing with what some call
"liumang" or troublemakers, blaming them for crime and crowding urban
transportation systems.  Many cities such as Beijing require migrant workers,
most of whom are 17 to 35 year-old men, to buy temporary work permits, with
sanctions imposed on workers and their employers if migrants are caught without
work permits.<p>
Until the late 1980s, China's household registration system prevented
large-scale internal migration, since persons not registered could not secure
subsidized housing or food coupons.  As China has permitted markets and prices
to substitute for rationing, Chinese residents were freer to
migrate--three-fourths of China's 1.2 billion people live in the northern and
inland areas that have not boomed with the rest of China.<p>
Today, well established networks guide young rural men to particular
construction sites and, increasingly, young rural women to particular
factories.  China is attempting to dampen the demand-pull of urban jobs by
charging ever higher prices for urban work permits, and reduce the supply-push
of low rural wages by accelerating rural growth.<p>
Even though unemployment in China is low--three percent of China's 160 million
urban workers are jobless--at least 100 million Chinese workers are considered
free to look for jobs because they are not needed on the farms to which they
are assigned, or they work for a state factory that has stopped paying them.
In Shanghai, where 400 state firms closed in 1995, laid off workers require an
average three years to find a new job.<p>
An inspection of joint venture operations in Shanghai found that many firms are
violating China's labor laws by forcing employees to work overtime, not giving
them contracts, and not paying insurance.  Many workers earn monthly salaries,
and they are supposed to be limited to 36 hours of overtime each month, but one
firm ordered its workers to work 80 hours of overtime--it received a fine of
3,000 yuan ($360). <p>

In September 1995, Libya announced that it was ending its dependence on foreign
workers to open up jobs for Libyans, and to reduce illegal immigration.  There
are believed to be one to two million foreigners and five million Libyans in
Libya.<p>
Libya began to expel Palestinians to expose "Israel's plan to create a
Palestine without Palestinians."  Libya has begun dismissing many of the 30,000
Palestinians from their jobs in Libya, confiscating their houses, and ordering
them to leave the country.  Libya's leader Qadafi says that he is not deporting
the Palestinians, but pushing them to return to their own country.
Unemployment in Libya is unofficially put at 30 percent, middle class salaries
have been steadily falling, and there is reported to be unrest.<p>
Egypt does not permit Palestinians without permission to enter Jordan or the
West Bank to enter its territory, which led to the creation of a camp on the
Libyan-Egyptian border that held 1,000 Palestinians in tents in mid-October.<p>
In mid-October, Libya asked the United Nations for permission to fly home up to
1.2 million foreigners from various African countries--Libya has been under a
UN air embargo since 1992.  By then, some 5,000 Palestinians, 13,000 Sudanese
and 7,000 Egyptians had been expelled from Libya.<p>
Libya told the UN that it wanted to fly home 500,000 Sudanese, 300,000
nationals of Chad, 250,000 persons from Mali, and others from Niger, Ghana,
Nigeria, Benin, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau.  Diplomats said
that Libya ordered the foreigners expelled so that African countries would
support the country's request to lift or soften the UN sanctions.<p>
The foreigners in Libya include 8,000 hotel employees, 26,000 truck drivers,
70,000 masons, 300,000 factory workers and 500,000 agricultural workers.
Iraqis are reportedly eager to work in Libya--teachers can earn $200 per
month.<p>
Qadafi says that the foreign workers, who have no permits or identity cards,
may be allowed to return later because of the country's dependence upon them.

Israel is a country peopled largely by immigrants.  Since its establishment in
1948, some 2.5 million immigrants arrived, and 70,000 per year are expected to
arrive in the next decade, meaning that immigration will add 1.3 percent to its
5.5 million population every year via immigration, one of the highest rates of
immigration in the world.<p>
Some 700,000 immigrants, mostly from the ex-USSR, arrived in the past five
years.<p>
There are currently 72,000 mostly Thai and Romanian guest workers on two-year
contracts in Israel, including 43,000 in construction and 12,000 in
agriculture.  The Romanians report that the $550 monthly they earn in Israel is
almost six times the $100 monthly they could expect to earn at home.<p>
Israeli employers began to import Arab workers from the West Bank and Gaza
after the 1967 war.  At the peak, 120,000 Arab workers from these areas were
employed on a daily or weekly basis in Israel, including 72,000 legal commuter
workers.  Beginning in 1994, Israel turned to non-Arab foreign workers, after
failing to get unemployed Israelis to substitute for the banned Arab workers.
<p>
Some question Israel's replacement of Arabs with other foreign workers, arguing
that Israel can never be secure if it has thousands of unemployed Arabs on its
borders.  Even the new guest workers cause problems--Romanians have taken to
drinking beer in their off hours in Jerusalem.<p>
Each day in Gaza, a rectangle of 147 square miles, the 16,800 workers who do
have permits to work in Israel but are barred from entering Israel cost the
territory $1 to $2 million.  It has been estimated that each Arab worker
employed in Israel supports 20 dependents.<p>

Pakistan arrested or detained nearly 2,000 Bangladeshis the week of October 23
as the government imposed new rules to reduce illegal immigrants in Karachi,
where they are considered a "security risk." The government considers illegal
immigrants a threat because of their involvement in drug trafficking and
weapons and they are a drain on the country's limited social services and jobs.
<p>
Illegal immigrants make up about 16 percent of Karachi's 12 million
inhabitants.  About 80 percent of the immigrants are from Bangladesh.  <p>
The fishing industry is the largest employer, though some are employed as
domestic workers or set up roadside stands selling sugar cane juice or
cigarettes.  <p>
To keep immigrant workers out of the fishing industry, the government declared
that foreigners were not allowed in the harbor area without permission.  But
the government admits that it is difficult for employers to know who is legal
or illegal, especially since fake Pakistani identity cares and passports are
readily available. <p>
Work at the Karachi Harbor has come to a near standstill because more than
10,000 Bangladeshis, representing more than 60 percent of the harbor workforce,
have avoided work since October 21 for fear of being arrested.  <p>

Restricts Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
New Zealand, a country of 3.5 million, announced revisions to its immigration
policies that will reduce the influx of immigrants, leading to charges that the
country is turning its back on Asians.  The official target for immigrants is
25,000 annually, but 50,000 immigrants arrived in the 12 months up to June
1995.<p>
Most New Zealand immigrants came from the UK and Australia until the 1990s.
Since 1990, South Africans and immigrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, South
Korea, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore have arrived.  New Zealand is trying to
forge a bicultural system which recognizes the rights of the indigenous Maori,
who fear being swamped by Asian immigrants.<p>
Asian immigrants are criticized for using New Zealand to obtain cheap
English-language education's for their children.  According to critics, Asians
with established businesses deposit funds in New Zealand banks, move their
families to New Zealand, and then commute to Hong Kong or Singapore, using New
Zealand as a "bolt hole." New Zealand, it is alleged, is stuck with educating
the children of immigrants who do not intend to integrate.<p>
A recent survey found that more than half of the New Zealanders do not want
more Asian and Pacific Island immigrants.  Opposition to those from Australia,
Britain and South Africa is less, ranging from 15 to 24 percent.  The survey
found that the elderly and low-income New Zealanders are the least tolerant
toward immigrants. <p>
Beginning October 1, 1995, immigrants to New Zealand must post a bond of
US$13,000 that is forfeited if the principal immigrant cannot pass an English
test, and immigrants entering under the business investment program will have
to put at least one-fourth of their funds in a local enterprise, rather than
leaving it in certificates of deposit.<p>

Residency</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Following a request form the National Union of Mineworkers, South African
President Nelson Mandela held talks with several senior government officials on
October 27 to determine if foreign mineworkers should be allowed to vote in the
November 1 local elections.  On October 28, he announced that the more than
90,000 mineworkers will be granted permanent residency.  The agreement was
reached to late to allow them to vote in the November 1 elections. <p>
The National Union of Mineworkers claimed that immigrants from European
countries were being favored over the mostly black migrant workers form
southern African nations.  The union says that the workers from other African
nations are being treated the same way they were under apartheid. <p>
According to the Chamber of Mines, more than 400,000 gold and coal miners are
employed in South Africa.  It estimated that 45 percent of its 1994 workforce
and 44 percent of its 1993 workforce were hired from outside the country,
primarily from southern Africa. <p>
The union challenged the Aliens Control Act, under which workers are entitled
to permanent status after five years of working in South Africa.  The union
argued that many black workers have worked in South Africa for 20 years and are
denied permanent status.<p>

Maid</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a></a></a></h2>
The United Arab Emirates will not execute a Filipina maid who was found guilty
of killing her employer.  The maid claims that she killed her employer in
self-defense after he raped her.  <p>
The Philippines government is still working to secure her release from jail and
repatriation.   Although the death penalty has been dropped, the court may
impose a jail term and award damages to the family. <p>
There are an estimated 27,000 Filipino overseas contract workers in the UAE.
With a population of between 2.5-3 million, nearly 70 percent of the population
is foreign. Estimates from Asian embassies in Abu Dhabi and consular officials
in Dubai suggest there are more than 1.5 million Asian and Egyptian workers in
the UAE sending about $ 2.5 billion a year back to their own countries.  <p>
Many workers are recruited by illegal agencies who offer a sponsor to an
employee, but the employee may be passed along to yet another employer.  In the
UAE, it is particularly difficult because of the ruling sheikdoms of the seven
emirates often interpret federal legislation to suit themselves.  Federal
officials admit that the existing labor and immigration laws are not being
applied and it is only a matter of time before a crisis erupts. <p>
