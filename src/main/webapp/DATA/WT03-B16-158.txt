<img src="../caps/icap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">n August, 1994, a group of five Vietnamese economists from the State Bank and MPI stood on the steps of the New York Stock Exchange, took a deep breath, and went inside. That month, they also visited exchanges in San Francisco and Chicago, as well as the Federal Reserve Bank and other financial institutions. At the end of their visit, one official confidently declared that San Francisco's relatively small market was the most appropriate model for Vietnam's first exchange.<p>

Of course, building an actual stock market is a bit more involved than picking the right model. Now, two years later, even some of Vietnam's most productive and efficient companies find the notion of equitization (privatization with the State maintaining a majority of the shares) "a bit strange."<p>

Nevertheless, within the past several months, Vietnam's leadership has taken steps towards equitizing Vietnam's largest firms and now seems willing to address some fundamental issues that have log-jammed equitization in the past. By the first quarter of next year, 200 firms will have been selected for equitization. These firms, along with some 1,800 others, qualified for the selection process because they had assets over $300,000 and had already sold 10% ownership in the company to employees.<p>

In addition, private firms are seeking to find a place to stand alongside their soon-to-be equitized comrades, and some are finding success.<p>

Aside from the reported results of many companies, there are statistics which reveal extreme overall vulnerability. First, the average capital of Vietnam's 20,000 registered private sector businesses is $35,000 with less than 10% at over $50,000. Second, the average for the 6,000 state-owned firms is $725,000, skewed by several very large SOEs such as PetroVietnam and Vinacoal.<p>

In addition to the low capitalization of these companies, it is also not accurate to say that they are enjoying a smooth transition toward competing on the world market, or even its own market in the face of foreign firms. However, a review of domestic firms did reveal many that are repeatedly cited as promising.<p>
<br>
<font size=+2>
What Makes a Good Company
</font><p>


<img src="../caps/gcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="G">overnment economists from MPI, People's Committees, the tax department, foreign investors and others surveyed mentioned the same hundred or so firms--private and state-owned, large and small--based almost exclusively in HCMC which they would characterize as "promising."
Assets relative to their competitors commonly include superior distribution, price or quality competitiveness, access to loans, a focus on the domestic market and a strategy to deal with competition.<p>

Vietnam is opening its borders at a time of unprecedented global competitiveness and the risks of competition are extreme. The 100%-owned Vietnamese companies that are fighting to keep, and even gain, market share for their products and services often must make hard and sometimes unpopular decisions. In addition to these day-to-day business issues, managers of these firms must also concentrate on the politics necessary to hold on to the best business asset any company could have, a monopoly.<p>

The majority of these promising enterprises are manufacturing companies which are able to access low-cost labor and materials as well as protective tariffs. They are also competing more against foreign brands. But while they don't tend to face much domestic competition, they are going head-to-head with foreign brands which are increasingly more affordable as foreign capital comes to Vietnam.<p>
<br>
<font size=+2>
On the Right Track
</font><p>



<img src="../caps/ccap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="C">anned goods are an example of an industry on the right track. While HCMC markets are filled with foreign canned goods, Ha Long and Vissan canned goods are there too and often less expensive by a third. Ha Long's HCMC branch enjoyed 100% growth last year, according to a local market paper. It expects a turnover of ten times that this year. Low prices also enable Viet Can Co. to sell up to 300,000 canned products monthly.<p>

According to Le Quang Nuong, director of Vissan, consumption of canned and processed food reached 2,000 tons in 1995. Vissan now exports to Germany, and HCMC-based Tuyen Ky exports to Taiwan. The news isn't all good. Outdated equipment and a shortage of freezer space could force product costs up as a result of increased capital spending. But with few JVs in the canned goods industry, sales are expected to continue rising as canned foods become more popular.<p>

The instant noodle business has a similar story to tell, with Vi Huong, Vifon and Miliket competing against higher priced competition from Japan and Singapore. However, Vietnamese firms are adding local foods, including bun and pho, to their product lines. A local press source said that, "the domestic industry has completely defeated the high-price imported products on the market."<p>

An export success story, for this year anyway, appears to be the Vietnamese leather and footwear sector. In 1995, the sector exported 86 million pairs of shoes and 4,200 tons of leather and imitation leather to reach a $300 million turnover. About $18 million of that was reinvested into new equipment between 100 footwear enterprises. At the third congress of the Vietnamese Leather and Footwear Association in September, industry members declared they would aim to produce about 300 million pairs of shoes and 9,000 tons of imitation leather, worth $1 billion, by the year 2000.<p>

Yet another example is Finance Promotion Technology (FPT) run by Mr. Truong Gia Binh, the son-in-law of the well-known General Vo Nguyen Giap. FPT, a state-owned firm under the Ministry of Science and Technology, is Vietnam's largest personal computer distributor. The company services many state-owned and foreign companies and is appreciated by foreign computer-makers, like IBM, who must distribute through state-owned firms.<p>
<br>
<font size=+2>
Choosing a Strategy
</font><p>


<img src="../caps/scap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="S">ome firms, especially in HCMC, are succeeding by finding a niche markets. For example, a decade ago, Viet Than and Phuoc Long textile mills upgraded machinery to improve the weaving of kate, a fabric that is popular in Vietnam. Domestic fabric traders now turn to these firms for material instead of foreign sources.<p>

Others do the opposite. Take garment-maker Minh Phung, an up and coming private company. Minh Phung reports $100 million in assets and $60 million in export turnover. Minh Phung's managers decided to branch out into construction and real estate. Looking for investments and opportunities beyond their core business activities is another pattern of promising firms.<p>

<br>
<font size=+2>
Focus on Product, Not Capital
</font><p>



<img src="../caps/ccap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="C">emaco is a well known raw-material supplier for soaps and shampoos according to Mr. Le Van Kha, general director of the state-owned company. Mr. Kha said that up to 80% of its clients are private companies and that he hopes to earn 200 billion dong this year. Cemaco is already exporting rubber and processed agricultural products to Russia, China, Korea, Singapore and Europe. Nevertheless, he admits that the future holds concerns. "The biggest challenge for us now is the pressure of competition from foreign companies," said Mr. Kha. "Because of this," he said, "the company cannot plan for the future."<p>

Vinachem's international officer, Mr. Nguyen Thieu, has similar trepidation about the future. The state-owned fertilizer company executive said that "our policy for the next five years is to concentrate on calling for investment. We have never thought about equitization or joining a stock market," he said. "The concept about the stock market is quite new and strange to us. We do not have any policy to deal with this." Considering that Mr. Thieu's company is making a profit, he probably has more pressing business than to learn about PE ratios. In fact, it is probably more profitable for Mr. Thieu to maintain the status quo than try to raise capital through a fledgling capital market.<p>

Why? One reason is that currently 65% of a SOE's profit is disbursed to employees (35% reinvested), sometimes equaling more than six-month's pay. If those same employees were to equitize, Decree 28/CP prohibits workers from owning shares equaling more than six-months pay, nor can they hold more than 10% of the enterprise. And, the interest rate at which shareholders can sell is lower than the inflation rate, currently about 4%. If they are allowed to sell (some equitized firms aren't), and could find a buyer, they will earn less than if the profitable SOE remained state-held. While orchestrators of the present equitization scheme dispute these comments, nevertheless, business people continue to doubt the wisdom of switching, especially now. Said one, "it would take the endorsement of Do Muoi (Secretary General of the Communist Party) for equitization to be seriously considered." A deputy prime minister is to be named soon to direct the process.<p>

A local newspaper noted another problem. "One doubts the public is interested in buying company shares. There's practically no information on the State enterprises to be equitized."<p>

<br>
<font size=+2>
Equitization or Not, Competition Heats Up<br>
</font><p>

<img src="../caps/acap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">t a recent business conference, Nguyen Duy Khien, general director of the ASEAN department at Vietnam's Chamber of Commerce (VCCI), stressed that even those firms which are enjoying success might be fooled into thinking their success is wholly derived from their business acumen, rather than the safe harbor of high tariffs that ASEAN and AFTA will soon remove.<p>

"Vietnam has been a member of ASEAN for more than a year and there is little sign that people understand what it means," he said. "Opportunities and challenges exist only as general concepts. Vietnam is the only country in ASEAN with a majority of state-owned enterprises."<p>

Mr. Khien proposed that the government focus on developing several key competitive markets without "expanding protection to too many companies."<p>

A recent trend that Khien might consider to be in the wrong direction is the tendency for domestic companies to lobby the government for more protection. Mr. Khien, on the other hand, recommends that frustrated businessmen should look at themselves. A shoe manufacturer needs to decide whether there is a market for cheap shoes or expensive ones, then serve the market, he advised.<p>

Mr. Khien also said that the National Assembly should allow foreigners to buy shares in local companies. That just might give the foreign investor the chance to buy equity into the next <a href="../december96/related1.html">BITI'S</a>.<p>
