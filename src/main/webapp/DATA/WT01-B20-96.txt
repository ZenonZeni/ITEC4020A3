<P>Press Release:

<P>The Quad City Hemp Coalition announces that I will be holding a press conference Monday July 22, 1996 10:00 A.M. on the South lawn of the Scott County Court House, 416 West 4th St., Davenport, IA.

<P>The purpose of this conference is to update the press on events that occured at the Hemp Festival held at Credit Island, Davenport, IA on May 18th 1996, where I was accused of breaking a police officer's leg and police maced, then beat those in attendance.&nbsp; The charge against me of breaking the officer's leg has been dropped, thereby negating the excuses used the police to mace and beat people.&nbsp; In addition, I will announce a demonstration against the war on drugs, to be held Saturday July 27, 1996.  We will be joined by the UNITING SPIRITS, a group of like minded individuals marching across America for PEACE, FREEDOM, and an end to THE DRUG WAR!&nbsp; Their march ends at THE FESTIVAL OF LIFE, being held during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

<P>For more information, feel free to contact me at my home, phone (309) 794-9107.

<P>Sincerely,

<P>Chris Rice
