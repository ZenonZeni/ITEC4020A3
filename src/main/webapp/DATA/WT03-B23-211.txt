<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than half of the people in local jails on
driving-while-intoxicated (DWI) charges in 1989 had prior sentences to jail
or prison for drunk driving, according to Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) study released today.  The bureau, a Department
of Justice agency in the Office of JusticePrograms,
reported that about one in six had served at least three such prior DWI sentences
in a jail or prison.<BR>     
<P>During 1989, more than 1.7 million drivers were arrested for driving
under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI), and between 1980 and 1989
the number of arrests for DUI increased almost 22 percent, whereas the number
of licensed drivers grew by about 14 percent.<BR>
<P>
     DUI is the general term for drivers operating a vehicle under the influence
of alcohol or drugs.  The BJS study concentrated on jail inmates charged
with driving while intoxicated from alcohol and refers to them as DWI
offenders.<BR>
<P>
     "Jailed drunk drivers were found to have an extensive history of abusive
drinking and chronic contact with the criminal justice system," commented
BJS Director Steven D. Dillingham.<BR>
<P>
     "The study also found that DUI arrest rates for drivers under 21 years
old dropped substantially during the last decade," Dillingham noted.  "The
1989 DUI arrest rate for drivers 16 and 17 years old was 25 percent lower
than their 1980 rate, and drivers 18 through 20 years of age had a 9 percent
lower arrest<BR>
rate than in 1980."<BR>
<P>
     Almost half of the people confined on DWI charges who were interviewed
in jail were already on probation or parole or in<BR>
some other criminal justice status for a DWI or other criminal offense at
the time of their arrest.  About one-third of them<BR>
were on probation from an earlier criminal conviction.<BR>
<P>
     Half of the people in jail who had been convicted of DWI charges were
estimated to have consumed at least six ounces of<BR>
alcohol (about equal to the amount of alcohol in 12 bottles of beer) in a
five-hour period.  About 29 percent said they had<BR>
consumed 11 ounces or more of alcohol (approximately equal to 22 bottles
of beer) before their arrest.<BR>
<P>
     More than half of the inmates charged with or convicted of DWI described
themselves as alcoholics.  Forty-four percent of<BR>
the alcoholic DWI offenders reported that they usually drank alcoholic beverages
daily and almost 80 percent reported having<BR>
participated in an alcohol treatment program.<BR>
<P>
     The findings are based on data from interviews with a nationally
representative sample of 5,675 inmates in 424 jails<BR>
during the summer of 1989.  As of June 30 of that year there were about 395,000
people in 3,312 local jails throughout the country.<BR>
Other significant survey results:<BR>
<P>
     --During the 1980-1989 period the number of DUI arrests per capita grew
by almost 7 percent--from 982 per 100,000 licensed<BR>
drivers to 1,049.<BR>
<P>
     --About 9 percent of all people in local jails on June 30, 1989, were
charged with or had been convicted of DWI offenses,<BR>
and of this group, 86 percent had a prior sentence to probation, jail or
prison for a DWI or other criminal offense.<BR>
<P>
     --Of the convicted DWI offenders, 61 percent said they had been drinking
only beer, 18 percent only liquor and 2 percent<BR>
only wine.  Twenty percent said they had been drinking more than one type
of alcohol.<BR>
<P>
     --Almost a third of the jailed DWI offenders said they had been drinking
with others in a bar, tavern or inn before their<BR>
arrest and about a quarter said they had been drinking at a friend's house.
 About one in nine said they had been drinking<BR>
alone at home or in their vehicle.<BR>
<P>
     The study also examined the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of the
jailed drivers measured by the number of grams of<BR>
pure alcohol present in 100 milliliters of blood. It estimated
that DWI offenders in jail averaged 0.21 grams at the time of<BR>
arrest, compared to an average of 0.16 grams for drinking drivers
involved in fatal accidents during 1989.<BR>
<P>
     Fifty percent of the DWI offenders sent to jail were sentenced to six
months or less.  Among first-time DWI offenders,<BR>
half received sentences of 115 days or fewer.  For offenders with
two or more prior DWI convictions, half were sentenced to 181<BR>
days or fewer.<BR>
<P>
     The survey also found substantial differences in the racial and ethnic
composition of DWI defendants compared to other jail
inmates.  Of the jail inmates charged with a DWI offense, 67.7 percent were
white non-Hispanics, 8.2 percent were black non-Hispanics, 19.5 percent Hispanics
and 4.6 percent were from other groups, including Asians, Pacific Islanders,
American Indians and Alaskan natives.  Of the jail inmates charged with
other<BR>
offenses, 36 percent were white non-Hispanics, 45 percent black non-Hispanics,
16.9 percent Hispanics and 2.1 percent were from<BR>
other backgrounds.<BR>
