<p>
<h3>I.  OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>
My name is Janlori Goldman and I am the Deputy Director of the 
Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT).  I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify before you today on behalf of CDT in support of  the 
Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995, (S.1360).  
<p>
CDT is a non-profit, public interest organization founded by civil 
liberties advocates to advance public policies protecting civil liberties and 
democratic values in the development of new media.  One of CDT s 
primary goals for the 104th Congress is the passage of federal legislation 
that establishes strong, enforceable privacy protection for personally 
identifiable health information.  We believe the need for such legislation is 
the most critical information privacy issue facing our country today. 
Further, the passage of a medical records confidentiality bill should be 
viewed as an essential stepping stone to achieving other health care 
reform goals. The public will not have trust and confidence in the emerging 
health information infrastructure if  their sensitive health data is 
vulnerable to abuse and misuse. We strongly support  S.1360, and applaud 
Senators Robert Bennett and Patrick Leahy, as well as the bill's co-
sponsors for their strong leadership towards enacting medical 
confidentiality records legislation this Congress.
<p>	
At present, there is no comprehensive federal law to protect peoples' 
health records. However, a Louis Harris survey found that most people in 
this country mistakenly Êbelieve their personal health information is 
currently protected by law.  And most people mistakenly believe they have 
a right to access their own medical information.  In fact, only 28 states 
allow patients access to their own medical records and 34 states have 
conflicting confidentiality laws.  A federal privacy policy is urgently needed 
to address the fact that the traditional doctor-patient relationship is being 
intruded upon by increasing demands for health information.  CDT 
believes Congress must act to protect personally identifiable health 
information so that the reality of our laws will finally conform, to some 
extent, with the perception and desires of the American public.
<p> 	
To that end, CDT has been working with a diverse coalition of 
privacy and consumer advocates, health policy specialists and industry 
representatives, to develop a consensus on privacy policy for personally 
identifiable health information (see attached letter to Senator Bennett).  
This consortium of groups has operated with a keen understanding of the 
advances in technology today.
<p>	
The societal impact of technological innovations,  including those 
that allow medical records, data and images to be transferred easily over 
great distances, is felt across our country in significant ways.  The 
development of a national information infrastructure and information 
superhighway are changing the ways we deal with each other.  
Traditional barriers of distance, time and location are disappearing as 
information and transactions become computerized, and few relationships 
in the health care field will remain unaffected by these changes.  In the 
absence of any Congressional action on S.1360, the collection and use of 
personally identifiable health information will continue to occurr within 
electronic networked environments without privacy protections.  
<p>	 
 But while this information revolution may hold great promise for 
enhancing our nation's health, CDT and others who support S.1360 
believe that personal health information, in both paper and electronic 
form, must be handled within enforceable privacy rules.  Even useful 
technologies  pose potential risks, as conflicts may arise between an 
individual's  need to keep health information confidential and the 
economic opportunities posed by the computerization of health records, 
from lowering the cost of processing insurance claims to selling personal 
medical records for marketing purposes. 	
<p>	
Confidentiality must not be an afterthought in the design and use of 
information systems.  A provision known as "administrative 
simplification" has been included in the House-passed budget 
reconciliation bill and mandates that certain personal health information 
be reported in standardized, electronic form.  Although"administrative 
simplification" fosters the development of networked health information 
databases, the provisioin is silent on privacy.  Without protections such as 
those incorporated in S.1360, CDT believes the "administrative 
simplification" section should not become law.  
<p>	
CDT strongly supports the Medical Records Confidentiality Act as 
the most comprehensive and strong privacy bill the Congress has yet 
considered in this area.  Similiar legislation was widely supported by both 
Republicans and Democrats during last Congress' effort to enact health 
care reform.  We commend Senator Bennett,  Senator Leahy and this 
Committee for the leadership and commitment you have shown on this 
important legislation.  Our testimony today outlines the need for this 
legislation, discussion of S.1360, and our recommendations for 
<a name = "need">strengthening and clarifying several sections of the bill.</a> 
<p>
<p>
<h3>II.  THE NEED AND DEMAND FOR FEDERAL PRIVACY PROTECTION</h3>
<p>
<b>A.  Consensus Exists</b>
<p>
A consensus exists that federal legislation is needed to protect the 
privacy of personal health care records.  At a conference in Washington, 
D.C. two years ago, co-sponsored by the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs, 
the American Health Information Management Association, and Equifax, 
nearly every panelist and member of Congress supported the need for 
making privacy an integral part of the health care reform effort underway 
at that time.  In agreement were panelists from the American Medical 
Association, CIGNA Health Care, the U.S. Public Interest Research 
Group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and IBM.
<p>	
At the conference, Louis Harris and Associates released their Health 
Information Privacy Survey, prepared with the assistance of Dr. Alan 
Westin, a privacy expert at Columbia University.  The survey found that 
the majority of the public (56%) favored the enactment of strong 
comprehensive federal legislation governing the privacy of health care 
information.  In fact, eighty-five percent (85%) said that protecting the 
confidentiality of medical records was absolutely essential or very 
important to them.  Most people wanted penalties imposed for 
unauthorized disclosure of medical records (96%), guaranteed access to 
their own records (96%), and rules regulating third-party access. 
<p>	
A 1992 Harris survey showed that while a large majority of people 
recognize the benefits to society of innovative technology, nearly nine out 
of ten people believe computers make it easier for someone to improperly 
obtain confidential personal information.  Twenty-five percent of the 
public believe they have been the victim of an improper disclosure of 
personal medical information.
<p>	
In addition, a number of federal studies have concluded that a 
federal law is needed to protect peoples' medical records. In 1994, the 
Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) issued a report entitled  Protecting 
Privacy in Computerized Medical Information,  which addresses the 
effects of the computerization of medical records on people's privacy.  In 
recommending comprehensive federal legislation, OTA found that:
<p>
<blockquote>[t]he expanded use of medical records for non treatment purposes exacerbates the shortcomings of existing legal schemes to protect 
privacy in patient information.  The law must address the increase in 
the flow of data outward from the medical care relationship by both 
addressing the question of appropriate access to data and providing 
redress to those who have been wronged by privacy violations.  Lack 
of such guidelines, and failure to make them enforceable, could affect 
the quality and integrity of the medical record itself.  (OTA Report, p.  
44).</blockquote>
<p>
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science 
released a study that focused on the risks and opportunities associated 
with protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personally-identifiable 
health data.  The IOM report recommended that Congress enact 
legislation to preempt state laws to establish a uniform requirement for 
the confidentiality and protection of privacy rights for personally-
identifiable health data, and specify a Code of Fair Health Information 
Practices to ensure a proper balance between required disclosures, use of 
data, and patient privacy.  
<p>	
Most recently, Professor Larry Gostin concluded that a federal 
preemptive statute based on fair information practices was necessary to 
protect personal privacy as networked health information databases are 
growing. (80 Cornell Law Review 451 (1995). 
<p>	
 All these efforts represent a tremendous pulling together of the 
public and private sector to achieve a critical goal -- the passage of a 
health records confidentiality law.  Nearly twenty years ago there was 
similar pressure to craft a medical records privacy law.  In 1977, the 
federal Privacy Protection Study Commission issued a report 
recommending legislation to protect private sector records, including 
medical and insurance records.  The Commission's recommendations 
sparked a Congressional effort to enact a medical records privacy bill.  In 
1980, due in part to pressure from the law enforcement community for 
unfettered access to health records, the legislative effort failed.
<p>
<b>B.  Negative Consequences</b>
<p>
The unauthorized disclosure of personal health information can 
have disastrous consequences.  New York Congresswoman Nydia 
Velazquez won her House seat only after overcoming the results of an 
unauthorized disclosure.  Her medical records -- including details of a bout 
with depression and suicide attempt -- were faxed to a New York 
newspaper and television station during her campaign.
<p>	
More common, and in some ways more troubling than the well-
publicized privacy invasions of public figures, are the consequences 
suffered by ordinary individuals whose privacy has been compromised by 
the disclosure of medical information.
<p>	
In one instance, a journalist disguised himself as a doctor, obtained 
an actress  medical record and published that she had been treated for a 
sexually transmitted disease.  In another case, a physician at a large New 
York City medical school logged on to a computer system, discovered that 
a nurse was pregnant, and proceeded to publicize that information.  Also, 
a Colorado medical student sold medical records to attorneys practicing 
malpractice law.  These are just a few of the more well known stories; 
undoubtedly there are millions of similar breaches that occur either 
without the knowledge of the individuals harmed or outside the media's 
spotlight.  	
<p>	
Further, errors in peoples  medical records have been difficult to 
correct and control.  For instance, Mary Rose Taylor of Springfield, 
Massachusetts went without health insurance for a year and a half 
because of a computer error at the Medical Information Bureau (MIB), a 
clearinghouse of medical information kept by insurance companies.  MIB 
reported that Ms. Taylor had an abnormal urinalysis, even though she had 
only undergone a blood test.  Ms. Taylor was forced to go to the insurance 
commissioner of her state to have the error corrected before she could 
finally receive health insurance.
<p>	
Despite the public and private horror stories, many Americans trust 
that the information they share with their doctor is kept private.  Indeed, 
the traditional nature of the doctor-patient relationship is intended to 
foster trust and to encourage full disclosure.  However, once a patient's 
information is submitted to a third-party payor, or to any other entity, the 
ethical tie between doctor and patient evaporates.  In fact, in a particularly 
telling statistic, 93% of those termed  "leaders"  in the Harris survey, 
including hospital CEOs, health insurance CEOs, physicians, nurses, and 
state regulators, believe that third party payors need to be governed by 
detailed confidentiality and privacy policies.
<p>	
Within our current health care system, many people try to protect 
themselves against potential privacy violations.  Some people routinely 
ask doctors to record a false diagnosis because they fear their employer 
may see their health records.  Some people don t even tell their doctors 
everything about their medical condition for fear of losing control over this 
sensitive information.  In psychiatric practices, it is common for many 
patients to ask doctors not to take notes during sessions for fear such notes 
could be leaked or even obtained legally with a subpoena.  And some 
people try to avoid the creation of a record altogether by paying for 
medical services out-of- pocket, even though they are entitled to insurance 
coverage.
<p>	
A few insurers have been candid enough to concede that their 
primary business relationship is with the employer/customer and not the 
employee/patient.  These insurers may be reluctant to disclose 
individually-identifiable health information if requested by an employer, 
but they will comply if pressed.  No federal law prevents disclosures by 
insurers to employers.  Most patients, of course, believe the fiduciary 
relationship is between themselves and their doctors, and don't realize 
that a third party with no direct relationship to their medical treatment  
actually controls the information.  It is intolerable to support a system in 
which an employer's payment of a portion of employees  health care 
premiums, a normal part of most American employees  compensation 
packages, amounts to employers controlling their employee's  health 
records.
<p>	
The problems that arise because of a lack of uniform, federal privacy 
protection for identifiable health information are often exacerbated by 
advances in technology.  For example, at the state and local level today, 
employers, insurers, and health care providers are forming coalitions to 
develop automated and linked health care systems containing lifetime 
health histories on millions of Americans.  The primary goals of these 
projects are cost reduction and improved quality of care.  
<p>	
Attempts are being made in some state coalitions to address the 
privacy, confidentiality and security of health data by crafting internal 
guidelines, regulations and contracts.  In addition, in those states where 
the automation of health care information is seen as a key component of a 
state's health care reform package, state legislatures and public agencies 
are attempting to enact legislation that establishes a right of privacy in 
personally identifiable health care information.  These states are also 
attempting to design effective enforcement penalties and oversight 
mechanisms to monitor the information practices of these newly created 
health data systems.
<p>	
The outcome of this piecemeal, state by state, approach to protecting 
the privacy and security of health care information will be conflict among 
the states and a setback for the overall goal of privacy protection.  
Relegating the protection of health care information to the states'  
different guidelines, policies and laws leaves individuals subject to 
differing degrees of privacy depending upon where they receive their 
health care.  In some instances, this means that individuals traveling 
across county or state lines to receive necessary medical treatment may 
lose their ability to control how their personal medical information is used.  
Moreover, states and local governments with different rules governing 
the use of health care information may be prevented from sharing health 
care information contained in their systems with neighboring states that 
insufficiently protect privacy.
<p>	
Health care records, in both paper and electronic form, deserve 
privacy protection.  But the vulnerability of information to unauthorized 
use grows exponentially as the computer makes possible the instant 
sharing of information.  As a 1992 study by the Workgroup for Electronic 
Data Interchange (WEDI) pointed out:  "The paper medium is cumbersome 
and expensive . . . Ironically, it is the  negative  impact of the paper 
medium . . . that has minimized the risk of breaches of confidentiality.  
Although a breach could occur, if someone gave access to health records or 
insurance claim forms, the magnitude of the breach was limited by the 
sheer difficulty of unobtrusively reviewing large numbers of records or 
claim forms. "
<p>	
Nevertheless, technology itself  is not the evil.  Information systems 
can actually be designed to promote the confidentiality and security of 
personal information.  For instance, a computerized system can sometimes 
be more closely guarded through technological devices than paper systems 
can sometimes be protected from prying eyes.  The key is to recognize 
technology's potential to enhance privacy, not simply to focus on the risks 
technology poses to undermine privacy. There is widespread agreement 
among privacy and security experts that protections must be built in on the 
front-end; it is too difficult and risky to try to add them after the fact.  
Privacy and security must be viewed as the foundation on which health 
<a name = "act">information networks are created.  Only then can we</a> acheiveÊthe potential for enhancing privacy and security. 
<p>
<p>
<h3>III.  THE MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY ACT</h3>
<p>
CDT strongly supports the Medical Records Confidentiality Act.  In 
particular, we support provisions in the bill that:
<p><ul>
<li>Gives people the right to see, copy, and correct their own 
medical records;
<p>
<li>Limits disclosure of personal health information by requiring 
an individual's permission prior to disclosure of his or her 
health information by doctors, insurance companies, and other 
health information "trustees";
<p>
<li>Requires the development of safeguards for the use and 
disclosure of personal health information;
<p>
<li>Creates a warrant requirement for law enforcement access to 
peoples' health records;
<p>
<li>Imposes strict civil penalties and criminal sanctions for 
violations of the Act, and provides individuals with a private 
right of action against those who mishandle their personal 
medical information; and
<p>
<li>Preserves state and federal laws that may be more privacy protective in certain areas, such as public and mental health.</ul>
<p>
 Without protections such as those embodied in S.1360, the rise of 
patchwork regulation and the widespread electronic transmission of 
records will produce the worst of both worlds--confusion and red tape for 
<a name = "recs">legitimate data users, asÊwell as debilitating fear and mistrust for people </a>seeking medical care.  
<p>
<h3>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<p>
CDT  believes that the Medical records Confidentiality Act 
represents a vast improvement on current law. Nevertheless, we urge that 
the bill be strengthened and clarified in a number of area, most notably by 
1)requiring consent for disclosure to health researchers; 2)heightening the 
warrant requirement for law enforcement access; and 3)narrowing the 
scope of the oversight section.  
<p>
<b>A. Health Research</b>
<p>
S.1360 currently allows researchers to receive protected health 
information without first obtaining an individual's authorization. We 
believe this is an unnecessarily broad exception and should be rewritten to 
incorporate a consent model.
<p>	
We acknowledge that in some instances the use of records for health 
research may be a legitimate exception to the bill's authorization 
requirements.  But CDT does not believe that the exceptions for research 
should be made broadly or routinely.  Research does not usually require the 
release of identifiable data; anonymous non-identifiable data are often 
sufficient.  In fact, research does not usually require the release of 
identifiable data without consent; it is often possible to get consent easily 
and prospectively.  
<p>	
CDT recommends that the research section be amended to require an 
individual's authorization prior to disclosure of personally identifiable 
information. We urge the committee to consider an analagous situation in 
which federal regulations that apply to NIH-funded biomedical research 
presume that consent will be obtained for use of personal medical records.  
Under those regulations, the nonconsensual release of records is only 
allowed when such records are required for the research to be effective, 
consent would be infeasible, and the project s significance outweighs the 
intrusion into privacy.  
<p>
The regulations have worked well for years at institutions funded by 
the NIH.  Since they acknowledge an individual's privacy interest while 
recognizing the value of research, we would urge the Committee to 
review them and to incorporate similar provisions in the bill.
<p>
<b>B.  Oversight</b>
<p>
We believe that the use of records for authorized oversight functions 
may be a legitimate exception to the general rule of nondisclosure.  
However, we are concerned about the breadth of the exception currently 
in S.1360.  As drafted, the oversight provisions of the bill have an almost 
undefined reach and could be over zealously extended.  We recommend 
tightening this section by requiring oversight officials to obtain an 
administrative summons or subpoena for access to identifiable records.
<p>	
We want to emphasize the importance of the general and specific 
limitations that are already in the bill.  Under the general privacy rules of 
the bill, health oversight agencies cannot re-disclose identifiable 
information for other purposes not specially authorized.  In addition, a 
health oversight agency may not use the information gathered in its 
oversight role for any actions against an individual other than those 
arising out of receipt or payment for health care or fraud.  
<p>	
With the inclusion of a legal process for access to identifiable 
information, CDT believes the bill will come closer to striking a fair 
balance between individual privacy and the government's legitimate needs 
to conduct audits and control fraud.
<p>
<b>C.  Law Enforcement </b>
<p>
CDT strongly supports the creation of warrant requirement for law 
enforcement access to personal health records currently in S.1360. 
However, we urge that the proposed probable cause standard be 
heightened to equal the standard now in place for access to cable 
subscriber records. Under the Cable Communications Act of 1984, a 
warrant can not be issued for access to subscriber records until law 
enforcement can show "clear and convincing evidence that the subject of 
the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity 
and the information sought would be material evidence in the case." We 
believe that federal privacy protection for peoples' medical records should 
<a name = "concl">be at least as strong-- if not stronger-- than we apply to peoples' cable</a> records.
<p>
<b>V.  CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
CDT believes the protection of personally identifiable health 
information is critical to ensuring public trust and confidence in the 
emerging health information infrastructure. Health care reform cannot 
move forward without assuring the American public that the highly 
sensitive personal information contained in their medical records will be 
protected from abuse and misuse. As the Harris surveys indicate, people 
are highly suspicious of large scale computerization and believe that their 
health records are in dire need of privacy protection. If people are 
expected to embrace and participate in a reforming health environment, 
the price of their participation must not be the loss of control of sensitive 
personal information.
<p>	 
In the end, any system that fails to win the public's trust will fail to 
win the public's support, and we risk having individuals withdraw from 
full and honest participation in their own health care. To allow people to 
fall through the cracks because their privacy is not fully protected is too 
serious a matter to continue to go unaddressed by the Congress. We urge 
you to continue your commitment to moving forward with this critical 
legislation.
<p>	
We have come a great distance in achieving broad consensus on the 
principles of health information privacy  and we look forward to working 
with you to refine and enact S. 1360.
