<p>AND NOW comes the PETITIONER, John M. Grubor, J.D., <u>pro</u> <u>se</u>,
pleading for Allocatur Allowance of Appeal as follows:</p>

<p>Petitioner pleads for relief from the <u>PER CURIAM</u> order

<p align="center"><u>QUESTIONS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW</u></p>

<p>The circumstances of this case involve the bona fide medical
use of a controlled substance for a life threatening medical
necessity (deadly seizures), which was justified under section
503 of the Crimes Code, and which justification should be a
complete defense to all other sanctions. The suspension of the
Defendant's Driver's License in the instant case is the Political
Subjugation of Medicine, which is an issue of immediate public
importance, justifying this Honorable Court's assumption of
plenary jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The three main questions presented for review by this
Honorable Court are questions of substance not heretofore
determined by this Honorable Court. There are two other questions
which this Court has &quot;apparently ruled upon&quot; but which
are included in the proposed PETITION FOR CERTIORARI contained in
the Appendix of this pleading. The two other questions are
subsidiary questions fairly comprised within the three main
questions and shall not be discussed in this pleading. However,
argument on the two other questions, as set forth in paragraphs
one and two of the aforementioned CERTIORARI, is hereby reserved
for subsequent pleadings and oral argument. The three main
questions are as follows:</p>

<p>A. Whether the commonwealth can suspend the driver's license
of Defendant, who is a bona tide medical user of a controlled
substance, for a plea bargain to a crime which had nothing to do
with the Motor Vehicle Code.</p>

<p>B. Whether the Commonwealth can refuse to consider the
issuance of an occupational Limited License to the Defendant.</p>

<p>C. Whether the Defendant was denied his constitutional right
to Procedural Due Process by being required to present his entire
case to the lower court in five minutes.</p>

<p align="center">2 </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><u>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</u></p>

<p>This case involves the bona fide medical use of a controlled
substance for a life threatening medical necessity. After having
bloody nocturnal Epileptic seizures for almost five years, the
PETITIONER (Defendant) began using the only substance that could
stop his seizures, Cannabis. Defendant was treated with Dilantin
and other drugs by three Neurologists for 4 1/2 years, but the
conventional drugs prescribed by the Physicians did not stop the
Defendant's bloody nocturnal episodes.</p>

<p>In 1986, Defendant read in the medical literature that
Cannabis (&quot;Marijuana&quot; in Spanish) was known to be the
only substance to actually &quot;stop&quot; Epileptic seizures.
Defendant was in fear of death from his nocturnal Epileptic
seizures for two reasons. The first was the possibility of ending
a seizure &quot;on his back&quot; and thereby suffocating on the
&quot;swallowing of the tongue&quot; effect. But he was also
fearing death from &quot;drowning on his own blood.&quot; On many
a morning, Defendant woke up with blood all over his pillow and
sheets. His tongue was severely bitten into on both sides and the taste
of blood would last for days. Sometimes it would take weeks for
the tongue to heal and the pain resulting from the back spasms
during the seizures would last for months.</p>

<p>Because Defendant had no other legal alternative, he began
using Cannabis for his life threatening medical necessity in
1986. His actions were and continue to be justified under the
criteria set forth in section 503 of the Crimes Code. Defendant
has had no seizures for nine years and his termination of the use
of the controlled substance is not Medically indicated.</p>

<p>In 1988, at the St. Louis University Medical School, and in
1989, at the National Institute of Mental Health, cannabinoid
receptors were discovered and located in the human brain. This
new evidence gave the answer as to why Cannabis was so effective</p>

<p align="center">3 </p>

<hr>

<p>in the treatment of Epilepsy. We already knew why the miracle
drug cannabis was effective in Glaucoma, AIDS, Cancer, Asthma and
other diseases, but the existence and location of the brain receptors
now explained it's tremendous effectiveness in Epilepsy,
Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other spastic
disorders. It seemed that the law should recognize these new
medical developments, but it did not. Instead, politicians caused
the POLITICAL SUBJUGATION OF MEDICINE.</p>

<p>In 1989, with George Bush playing &quot;tough on crime,&quot;
the &quot;Federal Mandates&quot; came in like gangbusters. The
mandates required the States to pass these new laws in order to
get the new &quot;Federal Money.&quot; The two statutes at issue
in the instant case are the results of the &quot;Federal Mandates.&quot;
No one paid any attention to the needs of the Medical Necessity
Users.</p>

<p>In March of 1992, Defendant plead guilty to the possession of
1/3 ounce of cannabis in return for &quot;one year probation and
no other penalty.&quot; Defendant never knew or was told of the
mandatory driver's license suspension during the court Colloquy.
When the Bureau of Motor Vehicles tried to suspend Defendant's
Driver's license in April of 1992, Defendant filed a Statutory
Appeal in the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court.</p>

<p>On November 4, 1992, the lower court dismissed Defendant's
Appeal and Defendant filed a timely appeal to the commonwealth
court. (The lower court order is attached hereto as &quot;Exhibit III.&quot;)
Oral Argument was not granted by the commonwealth Court and a
written &quot;OPINION NOT REPORTED MEMORANDUM OPINION&quot; was
filed by the commonwealth court on October 28, 1994. (Exhibit
II.) After consideration of a Petition for Reconsideration, the
Commonwealth Court denied same on January 10, 1995.</p>

<p>A timely Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal was filed
and is presently at issue before this Honorable Court.</p>

<p align="center"><u>REASONS FOR ALLOWANCE OF APPEAL</u></p>

<p>This may be the most important case this Honorable Supreme
Court has ever considered, because it deals with the Political
Subjugation of Medicine. This recently identified PSM phenomenon
has caused an increase in the crime problem, the drug problem and
the domestic violence/abuse problems in the last seven years. In
essence, an overwhelming issue of immediate public importance is
at hand: This Honorable Court is obligated to be a non-political
entity, and it must therefore consider and rule upon this PSM
which has invaded the Legislative and Executive branches of
Government. If the Judiciary does not do it's duty, then we lose
our only hope for a decent Government: The Statutes at issue in
the instant case were passed without the slightest regard for the
then current medical information, a prime example of the
Political Subjugation of Medicine. All three main questions
presented for review in the instant case are ramifications of
this PSM and are questions of substance not heretofore determined
by this Honorable Court.</p>

<p>The Petitioner is a member of a &quot;suspect class&quot; of
Medical Necessity users of the Controlled substance Cannabis, who
deserve &quot;greater protection&quot; than other offenders,
because their actions are Justified under section 503 of the
Crimes Code. This &quot;suspect class&quot; involves millions of
people in this commonwealth who use Cannabis daily for Epilepsy,
Glaucoma, AIDS, Cancer, Asthma, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple
Sclerosis, Emphysema, Muscular Dystrophy and other diseases, and who's
driver's licenses are put in jeopardy by their medical
necessities.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays to this Honorable
Court for Allocatur, Permission for Appeal and for oral argument.</p>

<p>Respectfully Submitted, by: John M. Grubor, pro se, PETITIONER</p>

<p>&quot;Proposed Pleading&quot; (not to form):</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</u></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>PETITI0N FOR CERTIORARI</u></b></p>

<p>Questions to be presented to the Court:</p>

<p>1. Whether a State may rule that a sanction passed under a
&quot;Crimes Code&quot; is merely a &quot;civil penalty.&quot;
(thereby denying the consideration of constitutional rights
applicability to the sanction).</p>

<p>2. Whether a State may deny Due Process to a Defendant who has
executed a plea bargain by later demanding additional penalties
(license suspension and over $10,000 in costs) which were not disclosed
to the Defendant at the time of the Court colloquy. (Defendant
would not have plead guilty if he had known of the driver's
license suspension)</p>

<p>3. Whether a Defendant in a Driver's license suspension case
is denied Procedural Due Process by being required to present his
entire defense in five minutes in a courtroom that was a
&quot;joke&quot; because of apparent case fixing by the tipstaff.</p>

<p>4. Whether a State may take away ones liberty (driver's
license suspension) because of a Defendant's use (justified under
503 of crimes code) of a controlled substance which had nothing to
do with an automobile or the Motor vehicle Code.</p>

<p>5. Whether a State may refuse to consider the issuance of an
occupational Limited License to those individuals in the suspect
class of Medical Necessity Users of a controlled Substance who's actions
are justified within the definitions set forth in Section 503 of
the Uniform Crimes Code.</p>
