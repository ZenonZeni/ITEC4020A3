Not only were our students captivated by your robot, but the teachers and faculty, too, thoroughly enjoyed the presentation. We had nearly 300 parents and children at a Friday night event.<BR>

I also appreciated the use of excellent teaching techniques, which included repetition, rhyming words and an organized format that children could follow and remember. These concepts can now be easily reinforced by classroom teachers, using the curriculum guides they were given.<BR>

As I watched our students, I could see that each one was enthralled by your robot and his antics. Since he was able to capture their attention so completely, it was easy for him to get his message across to the students on how important it is for them to take care of their "million dollar machines", their bodies. <BR>

Our teachers also commented on how much they enjoyed the assembly. One said "No matter how hard you try, you’ll never find an assembly that would be as good!" It was certainly time well spent.<BR>

Caledonia Elementary School<BR>
