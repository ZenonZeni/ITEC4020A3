BOTSWANA
POLITICS

Ethnic and regionally based tensions within the ruling Botswana
Democratic Party (BDP) look set to heighten over the coming year
following recent changes to the party's constitution that will limit
a president to two successive terms in office.

The new restriction is borne out of a dispute that has raged between
the northern-based Merahfe and primarily southern Kwelagobe factions
of the BDP since mid-1994.  During the last presidential and
legislative elections - held in October 1994 - the Merahfe gained
control of a larger number of seats in the 40-seat National Assembly
than the Kwelagobe faction.  This led to calls from the Merahfe for
changes to the constitution that would ensure all tribes would be
given equal status.  However, these calls were rejected by the
Kwelagobe, which enjoys the support of President Masire, and has,
since the country's independence from the UK in 1966, been the
faction from which the ruling elite has predominantly been drawn.

Masire's continued support of the Kwelagobe position caused a good
deal of anger amongst the Merahfe.  The ensuing row resulted in the
Merahfe collaborating with the opposition Botswana National Front
(BNF) to install Moutlakgola Nwako, a long-time opponent of Masire,
as speaker of the House.  The subsequent limiting of presidential
terms is a result of both the renewed vigor of the Merahfe in
pursuing their aim and a recognition on the part of Masire that,
despite the next elections being some four years off, without some
degree of internal reconciliation, the BDP faces the possibility of a
split so damaging that it would end its 29 year-old hold on power.

Just how far the recent change will go in lessening the Merahfe's
belief that it is treated as a second class faction within the BDP is
unclear.  Any hopes that they may have had that Masire, who has held
office since 1980, far in excess of two terms, would resign in order
that a new, Merahfe, president could take over, were quickly dampened
when Masire said that changes to the constitution were not meant for
an individual and that he retained the right to resign when he
pleased.

Masire's position was underlined by BDP chairman, Ponatshego
Kedikilwe, when he responded to a press report in The Botswana
Gazette that suggested that Masire would leave office at the end of
this term as a result of the constitutional change.  According to
Kedikilwe, the two term restriction will only apply from the 1999
elections and will not be retrospective.  Neither does the resolution
prevent someone who has been president before continuing for the two
term period.  This leaves the Merahfe facing the prospect of Masire
remaining in office until 2009 should the BDP continue to maintain
electoral success.

Given that prospect, and the growing resentment in the
Merahfe-controlled north of the country that the bulk of the
Botswana's impressive GDP growth over the last ten years has
benefited a tiny proportion of the population that happen to live in
and around the southern capital, Gabarone, the possibility of a
formal split along regional and ethnic lines remains very much alive.

The danger to the BDP as it now is, is compounded by the growth in
popularity of the opposition BNF.  The BNF quadrupled its support in
the 1994 elections to come out holding 13 of the 40 available seats
in the National Assembly.  Of the remaining 27 seats, the majority
are held by the Merahfe.  Should that faction decide to leave what
looks increasingly more like an uneasy coalition than a unified
party, the 1999 elections could prove to be wide open.

BOTSWANA
ECONOMY

Many of the political problems faced by Masire's government are the
result of problems with the economy.  Despite GDP growth of around 6%
a year for the last five years and, at US$2,600, a relatively high
annual GDP per head, the figures mask vast inequalities in the
distribution of both wealth and jobs.  Some 75% of the population
live in impoverished rural areas and are dependent on the subsistence
agriculture and cattle farming that tends to be omitted from economic
performance figures.  Botswana's geography is particularly
unforgiving to farmers in that much of the countryside is made up of
the sandy lands of the Kalahari desert.

The modern sector of Botswana's economy suffers from the fact that it
is highly dependent on its minerals sector.  The country is the
world's leading producer of top quality diamonds and also exports
copper-nickel ore, coal and soda ash.  This dependence on mining
leaves the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for its
commodities.  Such fluctuations were responsible for the downturn in
growth experienced during 1992/93.

While development of the mining sector has been responsible for the
country's impressive GDP figures, distribution of that growth in
wealth has been restricted by the fact that the mining sector only
employs some 4% of the labor force.  In addition, the country's three
largest mines are in private, South African, ownership.

In the modern sector of the economy as a whole, unemployment runs at
around 25%.  In an attempt to keep the lid on the situation, the
government has become the country's largest employer, taking up some
30% of the modern sector workforce.  This has resulted in an
inefficient collection of parastatals which, according to a recent
report from the auditor general's office, are losing millions of pula
a year.  The report says that the Botswana Agricultural Marketing
Board has lost some Bp4 million this year alone and is unlikely to
continue trading without continued government support.

Attempts by the government to draw foreign investors into sectors
other than mining in order to diversify the economy and reduce its
vulnerability to commodity price changes have met with little
success.  Manufacturing still accounts for less than 10% of exports.

In addition to creating employment in the public sector and trying to
draw in foreign investment, the government actively encourages
workers to find jobs abroad.  Estimates suggest that some 40,000
Botswanans follow this path every year.  The vast majority find work
in neighboring South Africa, source of some 85% of Botswana's
imports.

While a modest rise in the price of diamonds on the world markets
this year has helped Botswana to some extent, the government fears
that if diversification does not come quickly, a possible saturation
of the market by Russian diamond sales may do considerable harm to
both the economic and political stability of the country.  Should
that turn out to be the case, the likelihood of foreign investors
moving in to the country will diminish.

COTE D'IVOIRE
POLITICS

Coming hard on the heels of  President Konan Bedie's controversial
presidential reelection of October 22, the ruling Democratic Party of
Cote d'Iviore - African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA) is sure to have
maintained, albeit at a slightly reduced level, its hold on power
following the November 26 parliamentary polls.

Unlike the presidential elections, which were subject to a boycott by
the country's two main opposition parties, both the Ivorian Popular
Front (IFP) and the Rally of Republicans (RDR) took part in the
legislative poll.  With counting completed for 151 of the 172
contested, the PDCI-RDA had secured 133 with both the IFP and RDR
claiming nine each.  The figure of 172 seats is three short of the
full National Assembly complement of 175 seats.  The three remaining
seats were not contested during the election because of the high
levels of violence that have taken place in them since the October
presidential poll.  Elections in these constituencies are to be held
at a later date.

All three of the postponed constituencies lie in the Gagnoa region,
stronghold of the IFP, and as a result of the postponements, IFP
leader Laurent Gbagbo was effectively prevented from taking part in
the elections.  According to government sources, the violence in
Gagnoa has resulted in dozens of deaths and thousands of displaced
persons.  Of the four constituencies within Gagnoa, the only one
deemed by the government to be stable enough for elections to take
place was, by coincidence, the only one in which the PDCI-RDA was
victorious in the 1990 parliamentary elections.

However, the government's success was not repeated there this time
round and the seat was won by the IFP.  Gbagbo, whose IFP joined the
RDR in a boycott of the presidential elections, described
postponements in the other constituencies as a cynical move to
prevent him from being present in the National Assembly when the
Speaker was elected.  In rejecting these claims, Interior Minister
Emile Bombet said that some 18.6% of Gagnoa voters had fled the
region as a result of the violence and, as such, were unable to vote
until peace returned there.  Be that as it may, weight was added to
the allegations of a government conspiracy against leading opposition
members by the earlier decision, by the Constitutional Council, not
to allow RDR secretary, Djeny Kobina, to stand as a candidate in the
elections.

Just days before the elections were due to take place, Kobina was
denied candidacy by the Interior Ministry on the grounds that his
parents were Ghanaian and that he could not produce a certificate of
Ivorian citizenship.  Despite his claims that the government had
deliberately lost his citizenship paperwork in an attempt to throw
the opposition into disarray, the Court upheld the government
decision and Kobina was barred from standing.  This was a similar
move to that which was used to prevent Alassane Ouattara from
standing as RDR presidential candidate against Bedie.  It was that
decision that led to the violence in Gagnoa and other regions.

Possible manipulations aside, the opposition parties were further
hindered by their inability to decide on joint candidates for the
parliamentary poll.  This left many seats with both an IFP and an RDR
candidate in the contest.  To what degree this split the opposition
vote is not clear, but it may well have had a bearing on the final
results.

Within those results, initial analysis would tend to suggest that
both the opposition parties' support remains localized.  The RDR
appears to be essentially entrenched in the north while the IFP is
best established in the center-west region of the Adzope enclave,
which includes Gagnoa.  The PDCI-RDA took all seats in the western
and south-western regions and were predominant in the central region.

Of the five PDCI ministers that stood for election only one, Alphonse
Djedje Mady, was defeated.  Francis Wodie, leader of the Ivorian
Workers Party and sole opponent of Bedie in the presidential poll,
was defeated by the PDCI candidate in the Cocody electoral district
of Abidjan.

Voting was said, by government sources, to have taken place with few
incidents, although independent reports on levels of fraud and/or
violence have, at the time of writing,  yet to be released.  It
cannot be ruled out, however, that in the light of the results,  the
opposition stance toward the government will harden and with that
will come increased , if generally localized, levels of violence.
Should that prove to be the case, a security clampdown may well
result.

Meanwhile, the December 17 municipal elections look set to be
postponed as a result of insufficient time in which to process
candidacies.

GABON
POLITICS

After 28 years as the ruling party, President Omar Bongo's Gabonese
Democratic Party (PDG) look to be increasingly at risk of losing
control of government in the forthcoming March legislative elections.

Much will now depend on whether Bongo and his party make good on
their stated commitment to ensure free and fair elections or follow
the same path as in 1990 when, in the country's first multi-party
elections, the opposition were denied victory by vote rigging and
fraud.  The ensuing hostilities between government and opposition
resulted in several changes to the country's political structure.

The Movement of National Recovery (MORENA), led by Mba Abessole and,
in 1990, the major threat to Bongo and the PDG, split into several
factions following differences of opinion over how to deal with
Bongo's devious behavior.  Abessole carried the bulk of MORENA's
support with him to his new National Assemblage of Woodcutters (RNB)
party.  The remainder followed two other factions known as MORENA and
MORENA-Originel.

Aside from the opposition split, the 1990 result also gave rise to a
series of measures aimed at reducing the Bongo's power.  Most
important of these was the move toward a new constitution that would
enshrine the necessary checks and balances to avoid a rerun of the
1990 electoral fraud.  Despite apparent agreement between the
government and opposition over the so-called Paris Accord, Bongo
continued to dispute opposition claims that the National Assembly was
the country's de facto government until the new Senate, provided for
under the French-brokered agreement, came into being.

Bongo lost his case before the Constitutional Court in mid-1995.  The
Court's decision, however, prevented the National Assembly from
ratifying the Paris Accord without a referendum.  This was duly held
and resulted in a 95% vote for ratification.  A further result of the
Court's ruling was the extension of the current period of office of
the National Assembly by six months, putting the date of elections
back until March 1996.

Going in to these elections, the PDG has 66 seats in the 120 seat
National Assembly.  The opposition Gabonese Progress Party (PGP),
headed by Pierre-Louis Agondjo-Okawe, has 19 seats and the RNB, 17.
The remainder are taken up by minority opposition parties.

Despite the RNB's apparent position of third, it must be remembered
that the results of the 1990 elections that determined this pattern
are widely believed to bear little resemblance to the voting that
actually took place.  The fact that the socialist and secular PGP
holds the main opposition position is more to do with the PDG
tampering less with its voting figures than a genuine lead over the
RNB.

The PGP draws most of its support from the Myere ethnic group and
urban workers.  Since the 1990 elections, the Myere have become less
important electorally as high levels of urbanization have left them
as minority groupings.  In addition, many of the urban workers upon
whom the PGP has depended for support are from the Nbazi ethnic
group.  There is some evidence from the 1993 presidential elections
that this group have undergone a shift in support toward Bongo.
Although the figures for the presidential election, in which Abessole
did not take part and Bongo was returned to office, are probably as
unreliable as those of the 1990 elections, the fact that Agondjo
received little support as a presidential candidate tend to support
the theory that the PGP can no longer rely as heavily on the urban
worker vote.

Far more worrying for the PDG than the loss of support for the PGP is
the fact that much of the shift toward urban areas has been
undertaken by the Fang ethnic group which broadly supports Abessole
and the RNB.  The broad conclusion to be drawn from these factors
would tend toward being that, provided the March elections are free
from the shenanigans of 1990, the RNB should see a considerable rise
in its support, possibly even enough to force the PDG in to a
position of minority within the National Assembly.  In addition to
the Fang, the RNB also draws support from the Bapunu ethnic group and
the urban middle classes.  Unlike the PGP, whose support is largely
regional and based around Port Gentil, the RNB is nationally
organized.

The PDG's problems are compounded by the possibility of an alliance
between the RNB and Bongo's son, Ali.  Although he has not openly
criticized his father, Ali Bongo, is known to be in favor of seeing
fair elections this time round and would like to see a shedding of
the old style PDG loyalists in favor of younger technocrats.  Ali
held discussions with Abessole in the aftermath of the 1993
presidential elections and it is believed that he is not averse to
seeing his father replaced if such an event would further his own
ambitions.

Further important dimensions to Gabonese politics come in the form of
the military and the (former colonial) French government.  Both these
actors have given strong support to Bongo in the past.  While the
French government has been critical of the lack of democracy in the
country, it was not above sending military support to the President
to help in the putting down of widespread demonstrations against the
regime in 1990.  France also trains and equips the Presidential Guard
(PG) which has been responsible for violent repression of the
opposition culminating in the destruction of Abessole' home and the
MORENA radio station Liberte in late 1994.

Despite former French President Mitterrand announcing a policy of
tying development aid to democratization in 1990, no French
government has yet implemented such a policy.  Relations between
Gabon and its former colonial power have improved considerably since
the May 1995 election of French President Jacques Chirac.  So far, it
is unclear to what degree the current French government is committed
to the Paris Accord brokered by its predecessor.

Coincidentally, Elf-Aquitaine, the oil company owned largely by the
French government continues to enjoy preferential treatment at the
hands of the Gabonese government.  In yet another coincidence, French
criticism of Bongo's administration has tended to become more muted
when rumors of the loss of Elf-Aquitaine's leases have surfaced.

Should the March elections suffer from the same irregularities as
their predecessors, it remains to be seen whether the French
government will turn a blind eye, or even exercise its moral
responsibility in aiding the Gabonese security forces in restoring
stability on the streets once more.  What is equally unclear,
however, is the degree to which the military would be prepared to
subdue the opposition as a matter of course.

On balance, the outlook for the PDG and Bongo is not good.  Attempts
by the regime to construct a more broadly-based government which
includes Fang members have done little to soften opposition desires
to rid the country of PDG rule.  If the results are again tampered
with, it is next to impossible, even with French help, to see how a
period of considerable political unrest could be avoided.

GABON
ECONOMY

Unfortunately for Bongo and the PDG, Gabon's economic position leaves
little room for maneuver.  The country suffers from an overly heavy
dependence on the oil sector and high levels of imported labor,
expertise and investment.  The falling price of oil since the mid
1980's coupled with excessive government spending has left the
country in a position in which it is heavily reliant on international
lenders such as the IMF.  Adjustment programs sponsored by the IMF
have met with little success in the past as attempts to implement
austerity measures have resulted in widespread popular protests.

The latest in a series of structural adjustment programs was
negotiated with the donor organization in 1994 following a
devaluation of the CFA franc.  The effect of the devaluation has been
to push prices up by some 40% since the beginning of 1994, but the
government's hands are tied in trying to offset this by wage
increases because of the terms of the agreements made with the IMF.
The problem of inflation as a result of devaluation is brought into
sharp focus by the fact that Gabon is dependent on imports for some
85% of its food needs.

In addition to the devaluation problem, siphoning funds off to
feather the nests of the ruling classes during the boom times of the
early 1980's has resulted in a crumbling infrastructure and growing
difficulties in supplying basic health, education and housing
services to the population.  These problems, in particular the
deteriorating road links needed to maintain the supply and export of
food and agricultural produce, have resulted in a large population
shift toward urban areas.  This has, in turn compounded the problems
already faced in urban centers and has given rise to unemployment
rates of some 12%.  This latter is of acute importance socially in a
country where the average wage earner supports ten people.

The one relatively bright spot for the economy is that the timber
industry is gaining ground as a result of Asian countries restricting
excessive logging and dangerous deforestation.  Wood and wood
products are second only to crude petroleum in terms of export
earnings.

1996 Budget
The cabinet recently adopted a budget of CFAfr817 billion for 1996.
This figure represents a 5% increase on the 1995 budget of CFAfr780
billion and conforms to the three year program signed with the IMF.
Given that inflation is currently running at an annualized 15% and
GDP growth is unlikely to exceed around 1.5%, it is difficult to see
how such a budget target can be met without considerable spending
cuts taking place.

Suspicion surrounded two major fires that took place at the Queen's
Palace and Finance Ministry in Antananarivo in mid-November.  The
fire at the Palace left the building razed to the ground, and the
loss of what was an historical landmark has been described as a
national tragedy.

Perhaps more immediately significant, however, are the rumors that
the Palace fire was set deliberately to divert attention from another
fire which started in offices within the Finance Ministry.  These
were not just any old offices, but the rooms which contained files on
tax and customs investigations, as well as highly sensitive cases of
embezzlement involving several well known figures.

Four of these are alleged to have been close associates of the
outgoing prime minister, Francisque Ravony, including the finance
minister in the first Ravony cabinet.  This was the time at which
Ravony was still very much involved in the business of "parallel
financing".  The subsequent row between Ravony and President Albert
Zafy  over an end to the practice led to the former's eventual
resignation.  Another alleged subject of the files was the former
President, Didier Ratsiraka.

The Finance Ministry issued a statement following the fire to the
effect that tax and customs files had not been damaged.  Rumors are
rife, however, that the most important of these documents have
disappeared.  Several senior luminaries in Antananarivo are said to
be breathing a collective sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, who replaced Ravony
following the latter's defeat in a nationwide referendum on
presidential powers in October, announced his new cabinet on November
10.

Rakotovahiny kept many of the central figures of Ravony's Cabinet in
place in what he described as a Cabinet aimed at continuity and
reconciliation.  The full Cabinet is as follows:

Interior, Decentralization and Territorial Security - Charles Severin
(retained post);
Civil Service, Administrative Reform and Labor - Henri Rakotovololona
(retained post);
Budget, Finance and Planning - Jean-Claude Raherimanjato (not in any

MALI
POLITICS

The peace that descended in the north of Mali following the August
decision of the Azaouad (Arab) Islamic Front (FIAA) to unilaterally
end hostilities with the government appears to be holding.

The FIAA was the last of the Arab Tuareg groups to be involved in
fighting the government since hostilities between the two sides broke
out in 1990.  Estimates suggest that during the intervening period,
some 50,000 Mali citizens have fled the country and sought safety in
neighboring Algeria and Mauritania.  Most recent reports suggest that
these refugees are now returning to Mali in large numbers, some
20,000 alone in the first two weeks of November.

In response to the improving security situation in the country,
President Konare, has signaled that conditions for the implementation
of the agreements made as part of the National Pact signed between
the government and Tuareg groups in 1992 are now in place.  The
return of Mali's refugees was central to the national pact and now
that this process would appear to be taking place, Konare has been
commenting on the means by which the remainder of the pact might be
instituted.

In addition to the return of the refugees, the 1992 agreements
envisaged a large degree of decentralization of powers and the
forming of autonomous Tuareg regions in the north of the country.
According to Konare, however, the government has decided that, in
order to facilitate the formation of these regions and achieve the
goal of widespread devolution, provincial boundary changes will need
to be made.

Konare has also been at pains to point out that such decentralization
will not be a quick process and has urged that dialogue on the issue
be continued for some time to come.  In addition, Konare sees the
overriding priority at the present time to be the rebuilding of the
infrastructure in the north of the country and the resumption of
basic services that have been impossible to provide during the
conflict.

The potential problem within Konare's suggestion of redefined
boundaries is that the original National Pact made no mention of
them.  Konare's response to this has been to say that fresh
boundaries are central to the task of decentralization and that the
new regions will be delineated in such a way as to allow the people
to unite along ethnic, cultural and historical bases.  What Konare
also concedes, however, is that the line-drawing operation will not
be without a mind toward the economic consequences for the country as
a whole.

So far, the FIAA have made no comment on Konare's proposals, but
should the redefined boundaries be such that the new regions are
denied access to means of economic production that the Tuareg feel
are rightly theirs to operate, there is a definite potential for a
return to conflict.  Whether this potential becomes realized or not
will depend, to a large extent, on the attitude to the changes of the
Libyan regime of Mu'ammar al-Qhadafi.  It was Qhadafi, reportedly,
who was behind the FIAA's decision to cease hostilities and recent
visits to Konare by the Libyan security minister suggest that there
is a high level of cooperation between the Mali government and the
ideological mentors of the Tuareg rebels.  Provided that this
cooperation continues, there must be a reasonable chance that the
peace in Mali will hold.

MALI
ECONOMY

Despite being offset to some extent by the end of hostilities, the
return of so many refugees to Mali will undoubtedly put pressure on
the government's coffers.  This will be of particular importance as
Mali is halfway through an IMF/World Bank sponsored structural
adjustment program (SAP).

The SAP has already caused considerable anxiety in the country, which
resulted in anti-government demonstrations throughout 1995.  The
depth of feeling about the austerity measures that have been put in
place have percolated through to the National Assembly.  This was
underlined during the adoption of the 1996 budget at the beginning of
December.  At the beginning of the year, the budget for 1995 was
passed unopposed but with one abstention.  Eleven months on, the 1996
budget still passed, but was subject to seven No votes and eleven
abstentions.

Overall spending for the financial year to end 1997 was placed at CFA
Fr380.327 billion.  Revenues are projected at CFA Fr333.853 billion,
leaving a budget deficit of CFA Fr46.486 billion.  The deficit, down
from CFA Fr54.127 billion in 1995, is to be financed from external
assistance and the mobilization of domestic savings.  The government
points out that earnings projections now show a CFA Fr524 million
surplus in relation to the 1993-1997 financial program.

While encouraging, this relatively small figure will almost certainly
be swallowed up by the government's stated intentions of rebuilding
the north of the country.  Spending to offset the effects of the SAP
in areas such as health and education has already fallen from CFA
Fr13 billion in 1994/95 through CFA Fr10 billion in 1995/96 to CFA
Fr8 billion in 1996/97.  Given the added expenditure required to
ensure a successful transition to peace, the government's chances of
staying within its target deficit must be seen as slim.

MOZAMBIQUE
POLITICS

Hostile rhetoric and equally hostile actions have marked the
relationship between President Joaquim Chissano and Mozambique
National Resistance (Renamo) leader, Afonso Dhlakama, ever since the
former's victory in Mozambique's first multi-party elections in 1994.

Over the past few months, however, the situation has deteriorated
still further.  The gap between Mozambique's two main political
protagonists has widened to chasm proportions that make the outlook
for an already fragile peace continuing through 1996 less likely than
at any time since the end of the country's 16 year long civil war.

The chances of a return to an all out civil war remain slim because
of Renamo's lack of external funding or over-border base camps, but
there is a distinct possibility that Dhlakama is moving toward making
good on his February 1995 threat to split the country by establishing
Renamo control in the five central provinces in which the party won
electoral victory.

Mid-October saw Nobre Meque, district Administrator of Maringue in
Sofala province, abandon his office and the district capital after
reportedly being mistreated by Renamo members.  Meque was originally
nominated by Renamo and appointed by the government, but has
subsequently been accused by the former rebel group of collusion with
the ruling Frelimo party.  In addition to Meque, it has been reported
that several other Maringue district officials have also been forced
to flee.

Other reports, some of which have been supported by independent
verification, have surfaced of Frelimo officials being beaten and
arrested by Renamo members in Gorongosa district (also in Sofala
province) and Dombe.  The violence committed against these officials
suggests that at least some Renamo members have chosen to forego
continued political argument over the government's decision to place
Frelimo officials into previously Renamo-controlled areas in favor of
direct action to remove them.

If so, a deal of significance can be given to Dhlakama's recent
admission that there are indeed arms caches still hidden throughout
the country and that the process of demobilization of former rebels
remains incomplete.

Despite continuing to refute suggestions that Renamo is considering a
return to war, these latest admissions contradict earlier statements
by Dhlakama which denied the presence of hidden arms.  In dealing
with this contradiction, Dhlakama now says that he would like to see
the arms caches that do exist collected and destroyed.  Given that,
it would seem reasonable to assume that Dhlakama could institute such
a process, but there appears to be some confusion over who has
control of these loose weapons.

Dhlakama claims that they are caches that belonged to the former
Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM), but gives no
suggestion as to who is in control of them now.  The State
Information and Security Service (SISE), on the other hand, says that
they are in the control of Renamo units which are unwilling to give
them up.  Just who is telling the truth is unclear.  What does seem
clear, however, is that there are arms available and, increasingly,
there is the possibility that they may again see active service.
As if to raise the temperature still further, rumors of an alleged
coup attempt by former Renamo soldiers now serving in the Mozambique
Defense Armed Forces (FADM) were rife during November.  The rumors
were denied to have any substance by both Prime Minister Pascoal
Mucumbi and FADM General and former Renamo rebel, David Mongero.
According to Mongero, the FADM was concerned by the rumors and did
not want the image of former Renamo soldiers now serving with FADM to
be tarnished by suggestions that they would take part in any such
action.

For his part, Dhlakama went much further in his denial of an alleged
coup plot, accusing the government of putting the rumors about in
order to justify the security clampdown he says is taking place in
the country.  Much of the violence that has recently taken place is,
according to him, the result of provocation by members of the Frelimo
controlled Mozambique Police Force as opposed to being spontaneous
acts of aggression by Renamo supporters.  He does however, concede
that in his visits around the country he is constantly being asked
why, when Renamo won majorities in the central and northern provinces
of Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Tete, the government has
insisted on putting Frelimo governors into office.

There is no suggestion on Dhlakama's part that the frustrations
caused by this situation have led Renamo members to switch from
political lobbying to direct action.  The fact that the question is
being asked, however, does underline the feelings amongst rank and
file Renamo members that they are being denied a voice in the
supposedly democratic system they expected in return for laying down
their weapons.

These feelings have been accentuated by the government's continued
refusal to allow nationwide local elections.  Despite the government
claiming, with some justification, that it has no money to hold such
elections, Renamo members suspect a thoroughly different motivation.
As far as Renamo and Dhlakama are concerned, the government is simply
plain scared to hold nationwide elections for fear of being badly
defeated by Renamo.

Given the startling success of Renamo in capturing 112 of the 250
legislative seats in the October 1994 polls, there would appear to be
some justification for this theory.  Renamo further sees the policy
of installing Frelimo officials in important provincial positions in
the disputed provinces as a means by which the government is
attempting to extend its influence prior to eventual local elections.
In this manner, goes the argument, the government hopes to limit the
damage done to Frelimo when the local elections do come.

How realistic this assessment is remains to be seen, but the
situation looks set to worsen following the government's decision to
withdraw the local election bills from parliament in response to what
it described as a "lack of consensus" within the National Assembly.
According to the announcement which accompanied the decision, the
Assembly will now establish a working committee which will, in
cooperation with the government, set new dates for the elections.

This does not mean, however, that the elections will necessarily now
take place simultaneously throughout the country as demanded by
Renamo.  The government has made clear its preference for a staggered
approach to the elections and is unlikely to permit deviation from
that.  In addition, the likelihood is that they will not now take
place as scheduled during 1996, leaving an even longer period before
frustrated Renamo supporters have the opportunity to test their
theory of a local government landslide.  Dhlakama has asked the
international community to give Mozambique financial help in order to
speed the electoral process along.

The success of such a plea will depend in large part on what happens
in the meantime.  If attacks on Frelimo officials continue, Chissano
has warned that there are (unidentified) voices within the government
that are calling for a tough line to be taken.  A possible descent to
a state of emergency cannot be ruled out.

Commonwealth Membership
Meanwhile, a fresh row has broken out between the government and
Renamo over Mozambique's admission to the Commonwealth.  Mozambique
was admitted as a "special case" to the organization in mid-November
despite being neither a former British colony, nor an anglophone
country.  Commonwealth secretary-general, Emeka Anyaoku, explained
the decision to accept Mozambique's application for membership when
he pointed out that the country has had associations with the
Commonwealth since 1975 when it joined in sanctions against the
minority white government of the then Rhodesia.

Reactions to Mozambique's admission were swift.  Renamo led the
condemnation on the grounds that it was not consulted over the
decision to apply.  According to Renamo member of parliament (MP)
Jafar Gulamo, given that Mozambique has no anglophone tradition the
country's admission posed a fundamental question and, as such, should
have been subject to wide public discussion and possibly a
referendum.

Gulamo went on to say that Renamo would, however, give its full
support to the formation of a lusophone (Portuguese-speaking)
commonwealth because the Portuguese language was one of the few
binding factors within an otherwise varied country.   He criticized
the former colonial power, somewhat unfairly, for its lack of
cooperation with Mozambique to date and called on the new Portuguese
government to do all in its power to neutralize the effects of the
new membership.

Opposition ire aside, Mozambique's membership of the Commonwealth
should bring much needed economic rewards, especially given that many
of its neighbors are former British colonies and, as such, already
long standing members.  In addition to advantages in terms of trade,
the country should also benefit from technical assistance through the
Commonwealth fund for technical cooperation.

MOZAMBIQUE
ECONOMY

Work has now begun on refurbishment of the Cabora Bassa hydroelectric
scheme in Mozambique.  The scheme, operated by a joint committee with
members from Portugal, South Africa and Mozambique, has now secured
the necessary funding from both committee members and the European
Community.  No date has yet been set for the completion of the work,
but when finished, the scheme is expected to produce some 2,000 MW
which will be supplied to countries throughout the southern African
region.

Meanwhile, higher import costs as a result of devaluation of the
metical have been blamed by the Mineral Resources Ministry for the
18% rise in fuel prices over the last quarter of 1995.  As a result
of the increases, the first since June 1995, diesel will cost
MM3,500/liter, paraffin MM2,690/liter and gasoline MM5750/liter.
News of the changes will come as a disappointment to the country's
industrial sector which, according to Industry Minister, Oldemiro
Baloi, is on line to outperform target growth for 1995 by some 1.5%.
The original estimate for the sector's growth has been revised from
2.5% to 4.0%.

Banking Sector
President Chissano inaugurated the Mozambique International Bank at
the beginning of November.  The bank has an initial capital of US$10
million and shareholders include Portugal's Banco Comercial Portugues
- Banco Portugues do Atlantico group with 50%, the Mozambican
government with 32.5% and the Mozambican Insurance Enterprise with
12.5%.  The remaining 5% is taken up by the Community Development
Fund.

The new bank will have its headquarters in Maputo and will open two
branches, one in the capital and one in the city of Beira -
incidentally in Sofala province.  Former Prime Minister, Mario
Machungo is the bank's chairman.

TANZANIA
POLITICS

Tanzania's first multi-party presidential elections finally came to a
close on November 19 with the reruns of the earlier faulty elections
in Dar es Salaam.  Opposition attempts to have the entire electoral
process nationwide declared null and void were rejected by the High
Court and in a result which came as no surprise to anyone, Benjamin
Mkapa of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) was deemed to have won
the presidency with 61.8% of the valid votes cast.

Prior to the Dar es Salaam polls, nearly all opposition parties
declared a boycott in response to the elections throughout the
remainder of the country, which are now widely accepted as having
been riven by fraud.  This boycott was subsequently declared illegal
by the National Electoral Commission on the grounds that the
opposition candidates could not boycott elections in 3% of their
constituencies after having competed in the remaining 97%.

Be that as it may, opposition leaders and parties went on to boycott
the new parliament and the inauguration of the new president.  So
strong were the indications of widespread vote tampering that many
foreign diplomats joined the opposition in failing to attend the
inauguration ceremony.

While individual diplomats may have succeeded in sending a message of
discontent over the proceedings to the CCM, the community of
international donors at large has not taken any action against the
ruling party's apparent willingness to cheat in order to protect its
30-year long reign in power.

A joint statement issued by Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany,
Ireland, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, the USA and UK following the
election results said that the donors believed that the result was in
line with the wishes of the people of Tanzania.  Given the sheer
amount of substantial evidence suggesting that the result bore
little, if any, resemblance to the actual voting that took place, it
is difficult to determine how these countries can be sure of such an
assertion.

Equally ineffectual was the statement released by the UN, which
provided the umbrella under which some 450 observers oversaw the
elections.  The organization recommended to the authorities that they
"correct anomalies" that had been found to be present.

It would be unfair in the extreme to suggest that international donor
and observer countries have an easy task in these situations.  The
end of the one party state is proving problematic throughout
sub-Saharan Africa.  It is questionable, however, whether it makes
long-term sense for those who promote democracy then to abdicate the
responsibility they have taken on.

The message that appears to be being sent to African countries in the
throes of forming democratic systems is that provided they "go
through the motions" of a democratic election, whether or not it is
actually democratic doesn't really matter.  This is a dangerous
message in a continent where the hope and belief in democracy is so
young and fragile.

The eventual outcome of smiling ruefully as if at some wayward
youngster is more likely to be the death of democracy in Africa than
its promotion.  Too many countries teeter on the brink of a return to
civil war for the international community to blithely disregard the
undermining of democracy.  If democracy is perceived to be a sham,
what realistic alternative is there for former rebel groups such as
Mozambique's Renamo, or Angola's Unita, other than a return to arms?

So far, Tanzania's international donors, who provide some 70% of the
country's national budget, have given little indication as to any
financial penalties that may ensue from the election irregularities.
The only government yet to break the silence has been the Dutch.
They have decided to resume balance of payments support suspended as
a result of CCM corruption in 1994.  Another resounding victory for
democracy.

The New Government
To some extent, all this is now academic.  Mkapa and the CCM are in
office for the next five years.  Shortly after his inauguration on
November 23, the new president announced that, given the CCM's
overwhelming victory in the general elections, he saw no requirement
to include members of the opposition in his government.

In line with this and his earlier pledge to slim down the Cabinet
from 29 to 22 ministers by merging some ministries, the new Cabinet
was announced at the end of November.

The vice-president is Omar Ali Juma and the Prime Minister, Frederick
Sumaye.

Under the President's office there are two Ministers of State, Mateo
Karesi and Danile Yona, the latter of which is responsible for
planning.

The vice president's office has one Minister of State, Mohammed Seif
Khatib and the Prime Minister's office has two, Bakari Mbonde and
Juma Mkangaa.  The remaining Ministers are as follows:

Home Affairs - Ali Amer Mohammed; Finance - Simon Mbilinyi (former
principal secretary to the Ministry of Finance);  Industries and
Trade - Abdalla Kigoda;  Communications and Transport - William
Kusila;  Agriculture and Cooperatives - Paul Kimiti; Health - Zakia
Meghji (who retains her position); Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation - Jakaya Kikwete (formerly minister for finance);

Development - Pius Ng'wandu; Natural resources and Tourism - Juma
Ngasonga; Lands, Housing and Urban Development - Gideon Cheyo;

Anna Abdalla (former Minister of State in the vice-president's
office); Labor and Youth Development - Sebastian Kinyondo; Community
Development and Women's Affairs - Mary Nagu; Justice and

(a former deputy minister).

TOGO
POLITICS

The opposition Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) reacted with dismay
to Prime Minister Edem Kodjo's early December reshuffle.  The CAR's
Yao Agboyibo described the reshuffle, in which the number of cabinet
ministers was increased from 21 to 23,as a massive entrance into
government of the barons of the country's former sole ruling party,
the Rally of the Togolese People.

Agboyibo went on to say that the reshuffle came at a particularly
difficult time as the National Assembly is set to begin debates on
the formation of a National Electoral Commission and Constitutional
Court.

It would appear that, in making the cabinet changes, Kodjo has caved
in to pressure from President Gnassingbe Eyadema to install as many
of his cronies as possible prior to the formation of bodies that will
oversee the development of democracy in the country.  The new cabinet
is as follows:

Foreign Affairs and Cooperation - Barry Moussa Barque;

UGANDA
POLITICS

Despite reports of talks between President Yoweri Museveni and Libyan
leader, Mu'ammar al-Qhadafi, on ending the dispute between Uganda and
neighboring Sudan, tension around the border region looks to be
returning to the levels experienced at the end of 1994.  This latest
worsening of relations began in early November when, according to the
Sudanese government, Ugandan troops took part in a military attack on
the southern border areas in collusion with the Sudanese rebel
organization, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).

Sudan has made similar claims in the past, which have been matched in
frequency by Ugandan accusations of cross-border attacks into its
territory by the Sudan-based rebel forces of Joseph Kony's Lord
Resistance Army (LRA).  The situation plunged to alarming depths at
the end of 1994 when Sudanese aircraft bombed a village in the north
of Uganda.  Qhadafi intervened at that time as well, and the
so-called Tripoli Declaration was signed by both governments.  Under
the terms of the declaration, both countries agreed to stop aiding
the other's rebel forces, but the agreement fell apart following a
further massacre inside the Ugandan border by soldiers of the LRA.
Although Sudan denied involvement, Museveni unilaterally broke off
diplomatic relations.

Since the two countries pulled back from the brink of war, Sudanese
government forces' have experienced considerable successes in
advancing into areas formerly controlled by the SPLA and its splinter
group, The South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM).  These Sudanese
advances have virtually wiped out the SSIM, but completing the
mopping up operation against the SPLA is proving more difficult than
Sudan's President Omar Beshir would like.  Ending Sudan's civil war
in the south was one of Beshir's pledges when he ousted the former
Sudanese government in a coup in 1989.  His signal failure to do so
has caused considerable political pressure on him at home and he
would dearly love to see a resolution to the problem.

In the SPLA, the Sudanese forces have met an enemy that, despite
being overwhelming outnumbered and having suffered some stinging
defeats over the past two years, refuses to lie down and die.  The
reason the SPLA has been able to string things out so long, according
to Sudan, is that Uganda is providing the rebels with arms and
technical assistance.

According to Sudan, the latest attacks inside its territory were
carried out by the Fourth Ugandan Division aided by tank crews from
Eritrea, which President Museveni requested during Eritrean
President, Isayas Aferwerki's, recent visit to Uganda.  Eritrea broke
off diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1994 after accusing the Sudan
regime of training Islamic fundamentalists to destabilize the
country. The evidence of Ugandan and Eritrean involvement in the
latest attacks is said to have come from prisoners captured by
Sudanese forces. Museveni, however, denies the involvement of Ugandan
troops and maintains that Ugandan interest in the Sudan's civil war
is limited to observation only

Ominously, President Beshir has said that having overcome this latest
attack by the SPLA/Ugandan forces, the Sudanese army is now intent on
"repaying the visit of those who visited".  A further deterioration
in the situation cannot be ruled out.

ZAIRE
POLITICS

A date for the elections that will bring to an end the country's five
years of transitional government is still not set.  It would now
appear, however, that such elections may be held sooner than was
expected after the government's August decision to extend the period
of transition by a further two years.

That decision caused widespread dismay among opponents of President
Sese Mobutu who want to see a return to the premiership of Etienne
Tshisekedi, the prime minister ditched by Mobutu in 1994.  In
response to the decision members of the Sacred Union of the Radical
Opposition and Allies (SUR), which has Tshisekedi at its head,
carried out a series of ghost-town operations in the country aimed at
forcing a government rethink.

Such actions appear to have borne fruit.  The Electoral Commission
responsible for the organization of the elections was presented to
the Transitional Parliament at the end of November.  The Commission
consists of 44 members, half of whom are drawn from the Political
Forces of the Enclave (FPC) which supports Mobutu and the remaining
half from SUR.  According to government sources, the Commission would
have been ready for presentation earlier had it not been for the SUR
squabbling over who should sit on it.  The SUR is divided into two
main factions, that which supports a return of Tshisekedi and that
which supports Frederic Kibassa-Maliba.

Now that the Commission is in place, there is a reasonable chance
that the elections, originally scheduled for July 1995, will take
place within the two year extension period.  This view is supported
by the allocation of funds to do just that in the 1996 draft budget.

Mobutu claims to see this as good news.  According to him, he is the
only politician in Zaire who has been pressing for early elections.
Those within the SUR that have cast him as a dictator who is
deliberately stalling the path toward democracy are apparently
misguided.  Nothing could be further from the truth in fact.  Mobutu
welcomes the prospect of international observers for the elections
and believes that it is the opposition, not he, that is afraid of the
eventual outcome of the polls.  Just how long this new-found
enthusiasm will last remains to be seen, but Mobutu is doubtless
aware that the divisions within the opposition do, indeed, enhance
the likelihood of him retaining power after the elections.

Meanwhile, Zaire's budget estimates for 1996 were submitted to the
transitional parliament in mid-November.  The draft projects a
balanced budget of Zz5,700 billion.  To achieve the 70% rise in
revenue in real terms to meet the budget target, Zz1,428 billion
would be raised by an 88% increase in customs and excise duties and a
further Zz1,350.4 billion by way of a 107% hike in local taxes.  Oil
revenue is expected to grow by 53% to Zz698.2 billion and earnings
from the General Quarries and Mines and Bakwanga Mines Companies is
expected to reach ZZ678.3 billion despite a slowdown in diamond
production.

Expenditure is set to rise by 54% in real terms.  Interestingly, the
expenditure figures include a Zz606.9 billion package for the holding
of elections.  This is expected to be supplemented by external
assistance.  Other major expenditures within the draft budget include
Zz178.1 billion in capital expenditure and Zz1,178.1 billion in
public debt payments.
