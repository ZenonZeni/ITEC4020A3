This FESTSCHRIFT is a collection of sixteen original essays published to mark the retirement

of Sheldon L. Messinger. The topics covered are central to the study of formal social control

theory and practice; the authors include some of the foremost contemporary critics of social

control, writing on subjects for which they are well known. <BR>

<BR>

That this is an impressive volume is due in large part to the stature of the contributors and the

importance of their chosen topics.  Among the writers and their topics are David Rothman on the

modern history of justice reform, Gresham Sykes on imprisonment, Egon Bittner on policing,

David Garland on penal postmodernism, David Matza on drug policy, Richard Berk and Richard

Freeman on the measurement of crime, and Alfred Blumstein on punishment trends.  The other

contributors are as able and well-known.  The result is a valuable and original set of essays that

will be enjoyed by student and established scholar alike.<BR>

<BR>

The versatility of this collection will recommend it as a supplemental text to undergraduate

classes on various topics of crime control.  The sophistication of many of the papers means the

book will also serve the well as a graduate-level text.  It is unusual to find a book with such

broad usefulness, but this anthology accomplishes the difficult trifecta of coverage, creativity,

and depth.<BR>

<BR>

Some of the selections are closely related to previously published work.  Gary T. Marx's

assessment of undercover policing, Andrew von Hirsch's commentary on the future of

proportionate sentencing, Alfred Blumstein's revisit to the stability of punishment hypothesis,

and Jonathon Simon and Malcolm Feeley's critique of the new penology fit into this group.  Each

is an extension of previous work, offering palatable refinements to well-developed arguments. 

Scholars will find these selections reliable extensions, while students will be stimulated to

ponder more thoroughly the contributions they augment. <BR>

<BR>

In a volume of valuable essays, three stand out as remarkable, for quite different reasons:

Garland's commentary on postmodernism, Berk and Freedman's exposition on crime

measurement, and Gilbert Geis's account of the demise of the School of Criminology at

Berkeley. <BR>

<BR>

Garland writes with his usual easy confidence, putting into theoretically accessible order the

hodge-podge of trends and programs that has been our modern penal experience.  He links

together with a critical eye the managerial frame of reference of correctional administration, the

risk-management technologies of line practice, and the politicization of penal policy to argue for

a POSTMODERN view of penality.  He then criticizes the accuracy of this conclusion.  One

detects a hint of whimsical romanticism about the good old days of "rehabilitation"<BR>

<BR>

Page 63 follows:<BR>

<BR>

 MODERNISM, a subtext that is not only curious, given his earlier writing, but also a bit

annoying.  (Compare it to Pat Carlen's complaint immediately following that penal policy about

women uses repressive ideologies of "rehabilitation" to reconstruct the women into models

acceptable to male hegemony.) Yet the treatise holds together, placing today's penal knowledge

into a broader theoretical paradigm dominant in the social sciences and philosophy.<BR>

<BR>

Berk and Freedman's essay on the statistical assumptions underlying the measurement of crime is

a delightful exposition on selected analytic problems in the mathematics of crime.  The paper

discusses various statistical concerns: assumptions about the nature of the sampling population,

spatial interdependence, dependence in sampling probabilities, correlated error terms, and

aggregation biases.  They are better at pointing out the problems than at suggesting solutions, but

in a volume dedicated to ethereal considerations of social theory, this frank, grounded side-trip

into the numerology of quantitative crime research is refreshing and noteworthy.<BR>

<BR>

Geis's chronology of the demise of the Criminology School at Berkeley is at once gripping story-telling and shocking stuff.  He describes the way the political activity of faculty at Berkeley

became linked to the electoral politics in California and led eventually to the dismantlement of

the School.  By naming names, he gives substance to a distressing violation of academic

freedom.  The story -- which he admits may be disputed in some of its particulars by persons

named in his story -- puts us all on notice as to the ease with which circumstances can conspire

to overcome precious freedoms of the academy.  Scholars can use being reminded of this fact,

and students will be the wiser for knowing the tale.<BR>

<BR>

What binds this varied collection together is its thematic interest in social control contradictions:

policies devised as ways to protect the rights of individuals or communities result in their further

subservience to the state; new programs conceived as alternatives to formal social control

succeed in strengthening the apparatus of control; interventions developed to prevent crime

become institutionalized despite their proven insignificance in this regard; crime measures

designed to inform us inevitably reinforce biased understandings of crime and social control; the

exercise of freedom contains the kernels of its own demise. <BR>

<BR>

We are reminded that the study of social control systems is largely a meditation on the socio-political functions of contradiction.  This is an important, enduring lesson, one ably brought to

bear by these worthy advocates and scientists.<BR>

<BR>

My only quibble is a nagging concern about the audience of such a volume.  In the advertising

notes, Professor Emeritus James Short (current President of the American Society of

Criminology) says the book should be on the bookshelf of every politician and indeed every

citizen.  I am left to wonder, "Why?" For one thing, the language in most of the selections is

technical, jargonistic, or both, with special usages of ordinary terms such as "modern" or

"narrative," and the recurrent reliance on in-group terms such as <BR>

<BR>

Page 64 follows:<BR>

<BR>

"representation, "penality," and "discourse." Our penchant to speak in tongues to one another

tends to create a side-show to the main event going on around us, and it ensures that any lessons

we believe we may have to impart will remain closely guarded, as though a type of inviolable

wealth to be hoarded. <BR>

<BR>

It is also convenient.  The fact that our unremitting criticism of the actions of the world can

never make it into the action and language of the world protects us from accountability.  Social

control becomes something "they" do and "we" remark upon.  So as much as I liked this volume,

I am also tempted to wonder why it was necessary and whom it helped.<BR>

<BR>

Aside from the fact that Sheldon L. Messinger deserves so richly these accolades.<BR>
