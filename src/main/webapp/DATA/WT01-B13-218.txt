<BR>

It's Saturday morning and you're indulging in a little daydreaming.
While your financial advisors would prefer to think that you're dreaming
about financing your retirement, your dream this morning is about how to
get that new car...or how to swing a week or two in the islands...or how
to achieve just about any number of short-term investment goals.
<BR><BR>

At one point or another, we all have to make some decisions about how to
invest for the short term. In the case of a bonus or inheritance or lump
sum distribution, you may have a plan for how you're going to use money
that suddenly becomes available - yet you don't want it sitting idle in
the interim. On the other hand, you may want to set aside funds toward a
certain goal you expect to reach in the not-so-distant future, such as a
new car or vacation, and you want them to be earning until you need to
access it.
<BR><BR>

What do you do? Whatever you do (and you'll want to consult your
financial representative for specific advice), be sure to recognize that
your approach to investing for the short-term will vary somewhat from
what you'd do as a long-term investor.
<BR><BR>

<B>These are just a few points that you'll want to keep in mind:</B>
<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> In all likelihood, you are counting on a specific dollar amount to
achieve your goal. The stability of your principal, then, will have to
be more important to you than its return. Remember that the pursuit of
higher returns implies a higher level of risk. Because of your imminent
need for your money, you may not be able to withstand the degree of
volatility that would be acceptable to someone who has committed his or
her funds for the long term. You'll need an investment whose objective
is preservation of capital.
<BR><BR>

<LI> Access may be more important to you as a short-term investor. You'll
want to avoid investments that restrict (and these restrictions could be
in the form of penalties on withdrawals or limited service hours) your
ability to withdraw funds at any time. 
<BR><BR>

<LI> Pay attention to the fees that accompany investments. The fee
structure of some investments assumes that you have an extended
investment horizon and expect to remain invested for years. 
<BR><BR>
</UL>

That's true, for example, of mutual fund shares purchased in Class A and
Class B of Kemper mutual funds. Class C shares of Kemper funds may be
most appropriate for investors who anticipate a relatively short
investment period. 
<BR><BR>

Investors in Class A shares pay an upfront sales charge, and investors
in Class B shares purchase their shares with the understanding that
redemptions during the first six years may be subject to a contingent
deferred sales charge. Class B shares also pay an annual distribution
services fee of 0.75 percent for six years. Class C provides an
alternative for those who want to be able to redeem their shares at any
time without charge. In lieu of a sales charge, an annual distribution
services charge of 0.75 percent is assessed on Class C shares. (These
somewhat higher expenses will result in lower income and capital gain
distributions on a per share basis than are earned on Class A shares,
and the distribution fee for Class C shares remains in place regardless
of how long a shareholder owns the shares.) 
<BR><BR>
