<H2>SSDI--Beneficiaries To Lose?</H2>
<hr>



by Robert Bohlman, Director, NAMI Government Relations
<P>
	The House Ways & Means Committee Subcommittee on Social Security has held a hearing on the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program.  The chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. Jim Bunning (R-KY), is expected to go forward with legislation that would limit the time beneficiaries would have in the program without re-application.<P>
	The initiative is the result of the rapid and continuing rise in the number of cases found eligible and because success in getting these beneficiaries into (or back into) the workforce has been dismal.  (NAMI agrees, but believes that, in large part, the poor success rates reflect the strong disincentives for disabled persons to leave their safety net behind.)  Benning's proposal is to put recipients off the rolls after three years, but allow them to reapply.<P>
	This design turns the current system on its head.  Now there are "continuing disability reviews" that the Social Security Administration is supposed to conduct on multi-year schedules specific to disability categories.  (Acknowledgedly, these are not performed anywhere near as extensively as called for.)  The burden is on the agency to demonstrate that a person no longer meets the strict Social Security definition of disability.  The effect of the proposal would be to shift the burden to the individual, who would have to prove every three years that he or she is still disabled.  Some persons would not be inclined to reapply, and others with cognitive or socialization deficits would have a very difficult time applying all over again.
	<P>Once it gets to the full Ways & Means Committee, the proposal may well be extended to Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  This could have an immediate effect on housing for persons disabled by a severe brain disorder.  Many SSI recipients turn over their SSI checks to the group home where they live.  Interruption in the checks could cause many group homes to close.
	<P>It is still a possibility that Rep. Bunning's bill could distinguish by diagnosis certain disabilities that are irrefutably lifetime disorders.  These disorders, then, could be excluded from the requirement of a three-year limit and reapplication.
