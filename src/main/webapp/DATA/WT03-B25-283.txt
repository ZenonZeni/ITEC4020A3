<H2>Poes User's Symposium</H2>
<H3>Fourth international satellite direct broadcast services symposium for
NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES).<BR>
Annapolis, Md, USA June 10 - 12 1996</H3>
<HR><BR>
<B>Symposium Themes</B>
<UL>
  <LI>To inform users of current and future plans of US and international
polar satellite systems 
  <LI>To discuss the changes in NOAA's upcoming satellites (NOAA K, L &amp;
M), including changes in their direct broadcast systems. 
</UL>
<HR><BR>
The U.S. Congress has reaffirmed &quot;free access&quot; to the data. There
has been a significant increase in the number of amateur users of the data.<BR>
<BR>
Currently NOAA 14 is the primary afternoon satellite &amp; NOAA 12 is the
primary morning satellite.<BR>
<BR>
The Search &amp; Rescue Processor (SARP) on NOAA 14 has been inoperative
since launch. The backup computer failed.<BR>
<BR>
The next series of satellites, NOAA K to N will be the fifth generation
of NOAA satellites. The changes include: 
<UL>
  <LI>the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and Stratospheric Sounding Unit
(SSU) will be discontinued 
  <LI>the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, AMSU-A &amp; AMSU-B will be
added 
  <LI>the AVHRR/2 has been updated (to AVHRR/3) by adding a sixth channel
at 1.6 microns. It will be known as channel 3A; channel 3B corresponds to
ch3 of the AVHRR/2 instrument. These two channels will be operated alternately,
3A during the day &amp; 3B at night, although there was much discussion
of this during the meeting. Due to limited bandwidth A &amp; B cannot be
operated simultaneously. The use of data compression is being examined.
  <LI>additional sunshield for calibration, more solar panels, extra instruments
= increased weight of satellite 
  <LI>HIRS/2 replaced by HIRS/3 - a change in the calibration sequence.
  <LI>increased data transmission rate (1200 to 2560 bits/sec). 
  <LI>after NOAA K, command encryption will be used. 
</UL>
<BR>
With these changes the stored and real-time data formats have changed. For
details see <A HREF="http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/noaasis.html">http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/noaasis.html</A><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NOAA K may be launched sometime in 1997, but could be much later. Launch
dates will be dependent on failure of operating satellite for this series.
Some discussion of what &quot;failure&quot; meant, as in the case of NOAA
11 where the decayed orbit rendered much of the Earth observation data unusable.<BR>
<BR>
NOAA &amp; Eumetsat plan a joint polar program beginning 2001. NOAA to provide
afternoon spacecraft (NOAA N &amp; N'), Eumetsat to provide morning spacecraft
(METOP-1 &amp; -2). The METOP satellites will carry the same instruments
as the NOAA series, with additional European instruments.<BR>
<BR>
Eumetsat is developing a standard software package (EARP - Eumetsat ATOVS
Retrieval System) for processing locally received ATOVS &amp; AVHRR data
from the HRPT stream of the NOAA K, L, M satellites, and the future METOPs.
It is a combined effort between Meteo France, KNMI, UK Met Office, DWD,
ECMWF and ARA/LMD. This software will be freely available.<BR>
<BR>
There is a planned convergence of the NOAA POES program and DMSP, to become
the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).
It will be a co-operative effort between the Dept of Commerce, the Dept
of Defence, and NASA. This has been prompted by US budget savings, and was
directed by the President in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
The increased use of radio frequencies is creating interference between
the metsats &amp; other users. The World Radio Administrative Conference
(WRAC) in 1992 allocated two bands used by APT &amp; HRPT to the Mobile
Satellite Service (MSS). NOAA is monitoring the situation.<BR>
<BR>
Applications of POES data were presented at the symposium, including biomass
burning and aerosol detection, snow applications, coastal zone hazards and
the Global 1km project.<BR>
<BR>
Some educational programs in earth observation systems and satellite technology
were described. <BR>
