<title> Energy Efficient Mortgages</title>

<H3>4. Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) Can Provide Necessary Retrofit 
Financing</H3>

<BR>
The Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, various 
lenders, and numerous utilities have introduced new financing products for 
energy-efficiency upgrades. Home buyers are being encouraged to install 
efficiency improvements at the time of purchase through Energy Efficient 
Mortgages (EEMs) - which provide financing for efficiency upgrades as 
part of a home mortgage package. EEMs allow home buyers to automatically 
qualify for a larger mortgage to pay for efficiency 
improvements - improvements which then more than pay for the added cost 
of the mortgage through energy savings. Lenders provide EEMS under the 
rationale that the mortgagee will have greater disposable income from 
savings on utility bills and can therefore afford a greater monthly 
mortgage payment.<a href="#218" name="r218"> [ 218 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     The Federal Housing Administration.</B></I> The Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA) is authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 
1992 to offer up to $8,000 above the qualifying loan amount for 
cost-effective219 efficiency retrofit measures at the time of home resale. 
In October 1995, the FHA announced that it is expanding its EEM program 
nationwide. The FHA EEM will apply not only to retrofits but also to new 
construction.<a href="#220" name="r220"> [ 220 ] </a>A borrower can finance through the mortgage 100 percent 
of the cost of eligible energy-efficient improvements - which may 
include energy-saving equipment as well as active and passive solar 
technologies - without an appraisal of the energy improvements and 
without further credit qualification of the borrower.<a href="#221" name="r221"> [ 221 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="FannieMae">Fannie Mae <a> and <A NAME="FreddieMac">Freddie Mac<a>.</B></I> In Colorado, Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac have a loan program that allows borrowers to finance 
energy upgrades in both new homes and resales as long as the increase is 
less than or equal to the present-value calculation of the rated energy 
savings. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have expressed an interest in 
taking the program nationwide. Under Fannie Mae's Community Home Buyers 
Program, purchasers with incomes at or below the national median can 
finance efficiency upgrades with a 3 percent down payment. Freddie Mac has 
a similar program known as the Affordable Gold Program that reduces the 
cash required for the down payment. These programs qualify low or median 
income home buyers for energy-efficient homes using cash from utility 
rebate programs as part of their down payment.<a href="#222" name="r222"> [ 222 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     Pacific Gas and Electric.</B></I> In California, Pacific 
Gas and Electric has teamed with three lenders to automatically qualify 
buyers for an additional 10 percent mortgage, at below-market interest 
rates, for homes that are rated 10 to 25 percent more efficient than the 
California state energy code. Loan demand has exceeded all expectations. 
The lenders involved are now marketing these new incentives nationwide to 
utilities and ratings organizations interested in promoting 
energy-efficiency financing.<a href="#223" name="r223"> [ 223 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      Fannie Mae is pilot testing an unsecured home-improvement loan 
at below-market interest for up to $15,000 with the same California 
utility. This energy loan program is operated with a utility partner and a 
third-party consumer loan originator. If successful, Fannie Mae says it 
will take the program nationwide.<a href="#224" name="r224"> [ 224 ] </a>
