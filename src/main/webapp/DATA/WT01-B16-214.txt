<b>BRAIN SUPERHORMONE<br>
Age-Proof  Your Brain
with a DHEA Precursor</b><p>

Although many assume that with aging comes an inevitable decline in mental abilities, there are alternative approaches that can forestall any diminishment in brain power. One such promising approach is the use of a hormone called pregnenolone, says hormone and antiaging expert William Regelson, M.D., professor of medicine at the Virginia Common-wealth University in Richmond.<p>
According to Dr. Regelson, adequate research now supports pregnenolone's ability to enhance memory, improve concentration, reduce mental fatigue, and generally keep the brain functioning at peak capacity. Pregnenolone is a hormone produced in the brain and adrenal cortex from cholesterol; in turn, pregnenolone is the "parent" hormone for DHEA and other key hormones. Usually, starting at age 45, pregnenolone production slows down, and by the time one turns 75, the body is producing 60% less pregnenolone than in one's youth, says Dr. Regelson.<p>
Indications that pregnenolone could improve brain power were first demonstrated in experiments with students and factory workers in 1945. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts found that giving students once daily 50-mg doses of pregnenolone noticeably improved their psychomotor performance, hand-to-eye coordination, learning, memory, and stamina.<p> 
The biggest improvement in these skills occurred after 2 weeks on this dosage, indicating pregnenolone's benefit to mental function may be cumulative, says Dr. Regelson. Factory workers taking the same dosage experienced improved productivity and stress reduction, and felt happier.<p> 
Rahmawhati Sih, Ph.D., a researcher at St. Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri, has experimented with 500-mg doses of pregnenolone with elderly men and women. Dr. Sih found that in as little as 3 hours after taking the hormone, the subjects performed better in memory tests, visual-spatial tasks, and verbal recall. A 1992 study involving mice showed that pregnenolone is several hundred times more potent than any other memory enhancer previously tested. The researchers also reported that pregnenolone is able to restore normal levels of hormones vital to memory, which otherwise decline with aging.<p>
As Dr. Regelson sees it, an ideal memory-building agent would be one that is so effective that only a miniscule amount would be required to produce the desired effects. "Recent studies in both animals and humans indicate that pregnenolone may be this ideal memory-enhancing drug and also that it is the most  potent memory-enhancing substance known."<p> 
Dr. Regelson advises that the usual dose for pregnenolone for brainpower enhancement is 50 mg daily, best taken in the morning. To find out if your pregnenolone levels are too low, Dr. Regelson recommends a blood test or a salivary hormone profile; also, watch for specific signs of a pregnenolone deficiency, such as impaired thinking, the sense that you are not as sharp or smart as you once were. Generally, one can expect a "modest improvement" in brain power within hours after taking pregnenolone, he says, but, as this hormone's effect is cumulative, the "true beneficial effects" will emerge over time.<p>

<b>GET FAST HEADACHE 
RELIEF WITH TIGER BALM</b><p>

The next time you find yourself with a tension headache, consider daubing a little Tiger Balm ointment on your temples instead of popping an aspirin. Tiger Balm is a popular Asian-originated pain-relief formula containing camphor, menthol, cajuput, and clove oil.<p> 
According to a report published in Australian Family Physician, when 57 individuals with tension headaches applied Tiger Balm topically to their heads, they had significantly greater pain relief in as quickly as 5 minutes and lasting up to 2 hours. Even better, Tiger Balm was particularly effective at relieving headache discomfort during the first 5-15 minutes of onset, in comparison both to placebo and acetaminophen (Tylenol), taken orally.<p>

<b>FLOWER ESSENCES TO SOOTHE THE EMOTIONS OF MENOPAUSE</b><p>

Flower essences provide strong support for the mental and emotional issues that women encounter during menopause, says Patricia Kaminski, a leading practitioner of flower essence therapy and cofounder of the Flower Essence Society in Nevada City, California. Here are Kaminski's recommendations for flower essences to help women deal with menopause's emotional issues.<p>
<ul>
 <li>Alpine Lily—This helps women integrate the bodily experience of menopause, to move through the physical sensations of pain or discomfort toward a deeper sense of one's femininity.<p>
 <li>Black Cohosh—This herb is well-known for its estrogen-balancing qualities, says Kaminski, but when used as a flower essence, it works more energetically to open up blocked energy in the pelvic region, especially for women who feel anger, rage, or violence during the transition.<p>
 <li>California Wild Rose—This essence helps women who feel drained or exhausted or who tend to look back to their earlier life rather than forward.<p>
 <li>Fairy Lantern—This flower essence is helpful to women who find themselves resisting the developmental aspect of menopause, especially expressed as a fear of aging or a psychological need to remain inappropriately young.<p>
 <li>Hibiscus—Women who feel emotionally "dry" or who have reduced sexual sensation and response and who need to redefine their sexuality will benefit from this essence, Kaminski says.<p>
 <li>Pomegranate—This essence can help women redirect the psychological and physical forces of procreativity and reproduction into a new level of inner creativity.<p>
 <li>Sage—"Water" problems can manifest as increased sweating or urination as well as an overabundance of "watery" emotions, says Kaminski. Sage can help refine these into calmer, more objective feelings.<p>
 <li>Sagebrush—This es-sence is important during menopause because it can help cleanse and release accumulated physical and psychic toxins and instill a sense of inner stillness, or "pause."<p>
 <li>Scarlet Monkeyflower—The qualities of this flower essence help a women understand the emotional message of hot flashes.<p>
 <li>Walnut—When stability is needed and a woman needs to break old links or drop dysfunctional identities and move forward with new purpose, this essence is useful.<p>
 <li>Yarrow—Kaminski advises that this essence helps a woman who feels emotionally over-expanded and hypersensitive during menopause.<p>

<b>7 HERBS TO PREVENT YOUR NEXT COLD OR FLU</b><p>
"The best way to take care of colds and flu is to prevent them in the first place," says herbalist Daniel Gagnon, executive director of the Botanical Research and Education Institute and owner of Herbs, Etc., an herbal manufacturing company, both in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Here's what Gagnon recommends:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Astragalus—This herb is excellent for strengthening the immune system before a cold or flu shows any evidence of developing. Gagnon advises 15-30 drops of liquid astragalus herbal extract daily for 1 month as a preventive measure.<p>
 <li>Schisandra—The berries of this shrub, native to China, are effective in helping the body cope with stress and in enhancing its immune resistance. Gagnon advises taking a preventive dose of 15-30 drops, twice daily for 1 month.<p>
 <li>Echinacea/Garlic—Despite the best-laid plans, it is not always possible to permanently forestall a cold, so when the earliest signs appear (scratchy throat, stuffed nose), Gagnon recommends taking the following for 1 day: Echinacea (30-50 drops of liquid extract every 2 hours), vitamin C (500 mg, every 2 hours), garlic (1 capsule every 2-3 hours, enteric-coated for digestion in the small intestine), and the proverbial chicken soup or vegetable broth (1 bowl, 3-4 times daily). If you prefer fresh raw garlic, Gagnon says to use 4 g or about 1 medium-sized clove, but not to exceed 5 cloves daily to avoid heartburn or flatulence.<p>
 <li>Elderberry—The extract of the elderberry fruit can be effective in halting the advancement of flu. Gagnon recommends 40 drops taken every 4 hours.<p>
 <li>Goldenseal—If your cold has advanced to the stage in which your throat, sinuses, and lungs are inflamed, the phlegm you cough up is thick, your chest feels tight and sore, and your cold seems to have taken up residence in your lungs, it is still not too late for goldenseal to be of benefit. This herb can help relieve the inflammation of mucous membranes which, under these conditions, no longer can protect the body against the influx of bacteria and viruses. Gagnon suggests taking 20-30 drops of goldenseal extract every 2-3 hours until the inflammation is relieved.<p>
 <li>Osha—Also known as Porter's lovage, the root of osha has been used traditionally for sore throats and lung congestion. According to Gagnon, osha stimulates the lungs to remove accumulated debris-laden mucus, and move it into the throat for elimination from the body. Gagnon recommends taking 30 drops of liquid osha extract every 3-4 hours, or up to 5 times daily. Pregnant women should not use osha or goldenseal, he adds.<p>

<b>HERBS TO REDUCE AN
ENLARGED PROSTATE</b><p>

Men between the ages of 40 and 59 have a 50-60% chance of having a benign swelling of the prostate gland, states naturopathic physician Donald J. Brown, N.D., director of Natural Products Research Consultants.<p> 
One of the prime symptoms of this condition (called benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH) is difficulty in urinating, including pain, hesitation, strain, decreased force, increased frequency, incomplete emptying of the bladder, or dribbling after urination, says Dr. Brown. He offers the following naturopathic recommendations for reduction of prostate enlargement:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Saw Palmetto—European studies have shown saw palmetto liquid extract to be as effective as Proscar, the conventional BPH drug, but with far fewer, if any, side effects, says Dr. Brown. The extract also reduces the effect on the prostate of the hormones estrogen and testosterone.<p> 
     Saw palmetto tends to be quick acting, he adds, citing a 28-day study in which 110 BPH patients took 320 mg daily after which their painful urination was much reduced. In another study, a 43% increase in urine flow was produced after only 60 days of taking saw palmetto at 320 mg daily, and when 305 BPH patients took 160 mg twice daily for 3 months, 88% rated their treatment a success. <p>
     Dr. Brown recommends taking 320 mg daily, either in 1 or 2 doses, for 4-6 weeks, then evaluate the results; if favorable, add saw palmetto to your daily supplement program, he says.<p>
 <li>Stinging Nettle—Also known as urtica, this herb works to reduce inflammation and congestion of the prostate gland. In a 12-week study involving 2,080 BPH patients, taking 160 mg of saw palmetto extract and 120 mg of stinging nettle extract produced a 26% increase in urine flow, 44% reduction of residual urine, 62% reduction in pain upon urinating, 53% reduction in dribbling after urination, and a 50% reduction in nighttime urination.  Dr. Brown advises taking 120 mg twice daily of stinging nettle.<p>
 <li>Pygeum—Dr. Brown recommends 50-100 mg twice daily of a liquid extract made from the pygeum bark.<p>
 <li>Minerals—Daily dosages of 30 mg zinc and 100-200 mcg of selenium help prevent BPH and prostate cancer, says Dr. Brown.<p>
 <li>Diet—Dr. Brown advises men to keep their dietary intake of saturated fat low, including red meat, milk, and fried oils. They should emphasize fresh vegetables, fish, soy foods, and olive oil instead; even better, a vegetarian diet can reduce the amount of circulating hormones in the system (believed to be involved in BPH).<p>
 <li>Know Your Prostate—Dr. Brown cites a poll published in the London Times (March 26, 1995) indicating many men and women have no idea where the prostate is located in the male body. Specifically, 89% of men polled did not know where the prostate gland is, 62% mistook it for the bladder, only 50% of the men knew that prostate problems were only possible in male bodies, and only 41% of women were able to correctly identify the prostate gland.<p>

<b>STEMMING A HEAVY 
MENSTRUAL FLOW</b><p>

Many women experience an abnormally heavy menstrual flow, often on the first or second day of their period, a condition called menorrhagia, says women's health expert Christiane Northrup, M.D. If unchecked, regular heavy bleeding can lead to anemia, she adds.<p>
<ul>
 <li>Causes—Heavy menstrual flow  can be caused by a hormonal imbalance such as too much estrogen and insulin and too little progesterone, or an imbalance of a prostaglandin hormone called F2 alpha, says Dr. Northrup. Physical factors such as a uterine fibroid or a condition called adenomyosis (endometrial glands lining the uterus grow into the uterine muscle) can produce heavy blood flows each month.<p>
 <li>Preventive—As a first step, Dr. Northrup advises women with overly heavy menstrual flow to rule out all other factors by having a physical exam and a Pap smear.<p>
 <li>Diet—You can regulate your hormonal environment through diet, says Dr. Northrup. If you are a carbohydrate-sensitive woman (you crave sugar or salty snacks, are overweight, or have type O blood), it is advisable to reduce your consumption of these foods. They increase insulin levels in the blood and can lead to excess body fat; this in turn is associated with excess circulating estrogen, and this can upset the estrogen-progesterone balance. If necessary, limit your carbohydrate intake to once daily and make sure they are complex, not simple carbohydrates, she says.<p> 
     Specifically, Dr. North-rup recommends soy foods (miso, tofu, tempeh, soy sauce) and certain green vegetables (broccoli, kale, collard greens, Brussels sprouts).<p>
 <li>Exercise—The goal here is to reduce body fat as a way of controlling excess estrogen, says Dr. Northrup. She advises 30 minutes of aerobic exercising 3 times weekly.<p>
 <li>Natural Progesterone—Dr. Northrup advises applying 1/2 teaspoon of a natural progesterone cream (such as 3% ProGest) to your palms or skin 2 times daily beginning 2-3 weeks before menstruation. Results should be apparent within 3 months, she says. <p>
     If a stronger dose is required to counteract the estrogen, micronized oral progesterone tablets (by prescription) can be helpful, when taken at 100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks before menstruation, says Dr. Northrup. Two weeks after the period is finished, resume at this dosage, she adds.<p>
     According to Dr. Northrup, it occasionally may be necessary to use a synthetic progesterone such as Provera especially if you have a bleeding fibroid and the other natural remedies have failed to stem the heavy flow. Here Dr. Northrup suggests a dosage of 10 mg Provera 1-2 times daily for the 2 weeks preceding the period, followed by 2 weeks off, then continuing the cycle for a total of 3 months.<p>
 <li>Iron Supplement—If anemia is suspected as a result of heavy flows (and especially in thin women), Dr. Northrup recommends ANR Iron 27+. This provides 27 mg of time-released iron, which comes buffered with 120 mg of vitamin C and 75 mcg of vitamin B12. This iron formulation also contains amino acids and is designed to reach the small intestine before it is digested.<p>
 <li>Castor Oil Packs—Castor oil benefits the lymph system and liver and may help balance hormone levels. Starting 2 weeks before menstruation, Dr. Northrup suggests applying a castor oil pack to the lower abdomen for 1 hour, 3 times per week. To prepare your own pack, heat (but do not boil) enough castor oil sufficient to soak a small flannel cloth; wring out excess oil, fold the flannel into squares, then place it on the abdomen. To keep it warm, you may place a hot water bottle (wrapped in a towel) on top of the castor oil pack.<p>
 <li>NSAIDs—It may be necessary to resort to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), says Dr. Northrup, beginning 1-2 days before menstruation and continuing through the days of heaviest flow. She advises using the lowest possible dose (Advil, Orudis, or Aleve) at which effects are apparent and to take the NSAIDs with bananas to prevent stomach upset.<p>
