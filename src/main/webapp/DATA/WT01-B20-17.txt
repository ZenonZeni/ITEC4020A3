<CENTER><B>Circuit Judge's Dissent In Urinalysis Case Could Spur Supreme Court Review</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 24, 1996, Atlanta, GA:</B>&nbsp;  The 11th Circuit Court has ruled that a Georgia law requiring all political candidates running for state office to undergo drug screening urinalysis is constitutional, but it is the dissent that has attorney Walker Chandler talking. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"It's a great decision," Walker said.&nbsp;  "Have you read the 
dissent.&nbsp;  It hits the nail right on the head." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a scathing 11 page dissent, Circuit Judge Rosemary Barkett writes, "I do not believe that the suspicionless search in these circumstances serves any special governmental need beyond the normal need for law enforcement, and, if it did, I believe that the candidates' privacy interests outweigh the governmental interests. ..." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">...We are not merely dealing with the denial of a job opportunity, but with the denial of opportunity to participate in our democratic form of government." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barkett's dissent also calls into question apparent First Amendment violations posed by the controversial Georgia law.&nbsp;  "The majority maintains that the government's purpose [in passing this legislation] is not suppression of free expression.&nbsp;  Yet, it supports its holding by citing the importance of ensuring that elected officials are 'persons appreciative of the perils of drug use' and 'sympathetic to drug interdiction efforts.' 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Establishing a certain ideology as a 'qualification' for holding public office appears to be a content-based restriction on free expression." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Chandler, who filed the action against the Georgia statute and served as his own legal counsel maintains that he will forgo an "en banc" review of his case and will attempt to take his appeal directly to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;  He intends to argue that the law  violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp;  Referring to the Court's decision last year to uphold the constitutionality of a Washington state law mandating random and warrantless searches of high school athletes partly on the notion that school children live under fewer constitutional 
protections than adults, Chandler fires, "The only way the Supreme Court could [then] approve of Georgia's law is by affirming that all Georgians are [children.]" 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>NORML</B>'s recently reformed Amicus Curiae Committee is currently reviewing the 11th Circuit Court decision and will consider filing an amicus brief if the Supreme Court decides to hear the case.

<CENTER><B>Activists Intending To Sell Marijuana At The Super Bowl Gain National Exposure</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 14, 1995, Tempe, AZ:</B>&nbsp;  The rumor that marijuana will be sold openly during this year's Super Bowl has garnered the attention of the national media in recent weeks and has even made it to the pages of Time Magazine. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Representatives from the Richard M. Davis Cannabis Hemp Co. plan to be on hand selling marijuana, states the magazine.&nbsp;  "I plan to have a press conference in the parking lot," says longtime marijuana activist and R.M. Davis spokesman Ron Kiczenski, "[I will] tell people where they can buy [marijuana] in the vicinity of the Super Bowl.&nbsp;  Not within the secured zone you have to get a special venue license for, but outside of that zone.&nbsp;  They'll be able to buy legal marijuana." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Kiczenski and Davis have openly sold marijuana in Arizona before.&nbsp;  Ironically, on one occasion, the activists boldly set up shop in front of the Arizona State Capitol. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The activists latest plan stems from a ruling by Northwest Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp;  Basing his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the Arizona Department of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp;  Under Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license and 
tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information, please contact either Ron Kiczenski @ (602) 894-8994 or AZ4NORML @ (602) 921-2724.</I>

<CENTER><B>Defense Fund Established To Aid Man Charged With Marijuana Trafficking</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 24, 1996, Oregon, OH:</B>&nbsp;  <B>NORML</B> chapters in Cleveland and Fremont Ohio have united to establish a defense fund for 
medical marijuana user Daniel Asbury.&nbsp;  Asbury is a quadriplegic who has been charged with trafficking in marijuana for growing his own medical cannabis. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use marijuana as a therapeutic after prescription drugs proved to be ineffective at controlling his pain and muscle spasms.&nbsp;  Marijuana made me "fe[el] like a human being again," he said. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury was arrested in September of 1995 for growing his own marijuana to treat his medical condition.&nbsp;  Asbury's lawyer, Terry Lodge of Toledo, Ohio, will invoke "medical necessity" as the basis for his defense.&nbsp;  The trial is scheduled to begin February 26 at the Lucas County Court House. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The medical necessity defense is expensive and requires expert testimony to establish the foundation for the defense.&nbsp;  Asbury's legal fees, including the cost of flying in expert witnesses such as <B>NORML</B> board member Dr. John Morgan, will total in the thousands of dollars. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>NORML</B> will forward all moneys received for the Daniel Asbury 
Defense Fund to Mid-American Bank in Toledo, Ohio where an account has been set up to assist Asbury. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>Concerned parties can mail checks or money orders made payable to Daniel Asbury to: NORML Defense Fund, PO Box 771154, Cleveland, Ohio, 44107 or call (216) 521-9333 for more information.</I>

<CENTER><B>National Review Advocates Legalizing Drugs</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 21, 1996:</B>&nbsp;  The latest issue of National Review, a weekly conservative journal headed by syndicated columnist William F. Buckley, asserts that the "war on drugs is lost" and recommends that the time has come to make narcotics legal. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 15 page section of the political weekly, Buckley and a half-dozen other legalization proponents including Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore argue that America's "present prohibitive policy has failed, flatly and without serious question." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a telephone interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Buckley said that he hopes that the attention garnered from National Review will encourage the thinking community to begin seriously facing the issue of legalization. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Buckley, who just recently debated DEA head Thomas Constantine on the January 23 edition of "The Today Show," intends to follow up on the subject with three televised debates on his PBS program, "Firing Line."
