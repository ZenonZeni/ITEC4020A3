FOODSTUFFS: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL AGREE ON LABELLING

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Delegations from the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers
reached a compromise on October 16 - through the Conciliation Committee -
on the labelling and advertising of foodstuffs, thus settling a row over
the proposed amendments to Directive 79/112/EEC). The Parliament claims
the agreement reflects its commitment to the principle of free trade in
the Union, as stated in the ruling by the European Court of Justice on
October 26, 1995 in the "bearnaise sauce case", and whose scope the
Council appeared anxious to limit. By contrast, negotiations between the
Parliament and Council on the labelling of novel foods have yet to be
concluded and are being pursued.

On June 15, 1995, the Council of Ministers adopted a common position on
the amendment of Articles 3 (list of requisite details for inclusion in
labelling), 6 (single ingredient foods), 7 (quantitative declaration of
ingredients), and 14 (language used on labelling) of the proposal for a
Directive. On October 25, 1995, the Schnellhardt report (EPP, Germany) was
approved in second reading by the European Parliament, which adopted five
amendments: one to Article 1 of Directive 79/112 (trade name of a food),
three to Article 6 (list of ingredients), and one amendment to Article 7
(quantitative declaration of ingredients). With the Council unwilling to
accept three of the five amendments tabled by the plenary session, the
conciliation procedure was initiated on December 22, 1995.

In its ruling on the "bearnaise sauce" case, the Court of Justice deemed
Germany to be in breach of Article 30 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits
quantitative restrictions on imports, and all measures having equivalent
effect. In Germany, the traditional recipe for bearnaise sauce is based on
butter and eggs. The authorities demanded that imported sauces
manufactured according to a different recipe should bear the mention
"bearnaise sauce made from vegetable oil" and not the generic name
"bearnaise sauce". The Court ruled that Germany has no right to demand
such an indication on labelling of the product, as the term "bearnaise
sauce" is quite sufficient.

The joint text to emerge from the conciliation talks provides for a
product to be sold in other Member States under the legal name it carries
in the Member State of production - except in very exceptional cases. The
compromise takes account of pressure from certain Member States following
the "bearnaise sauce" ruling, by stipulating that the trade name can be
complemented by additional information printed adjacently. On the express
demand of the European Parliament delegation, these provisions are however
included under certain conditions: the list of ingredients (and other
provisions of the Directive) must not prevent consumers in the Member
State where a product is marketed from determining the real nature of the
food, and there must be no risk of confusion with other products.

MEPs believe this provision will have little impact in practice, as the
"bearnaise sauce" ruling clearly indicates that a list of ingredients
should be sufficient to prevent any confusion on the part of the consumer.
Moreover, the text of the Treaty must take precedence over secondary
legislation.

In respect of people suffering from allergies, the Parliament secured
Council approval for clear labelling of the specific vegetable origin of
starches entering into the composition of products and likely to contain
gluten.

It now remains for the two institutions to formally adopt this compromise,
the Council by qualified majority, the European Parliament by a simple
majority. However, the Parliament's delegation emphasised that it will not
recommend its adoption by the plenary session unless the European
Commission pledges to bring forward a specific proposal on the labelling
of alcoholic beverages, which are not covered by the present Directive.

Novel foods.

Are novel foods (a term covering genetically-modified products: soya
beans, sugar beet, flavour-saver tomatoes, etc.) different from
traditional foods and if so, to what extent? This question fuelled a first
exchange of views between delegations from the European Parliament and the
Council on October 16 at the Conciliation Committee.

Parliament is demanding that food labels should inform consumers of all
the characteristics and properties that distinguish a novel food or food
ingredient from an existing equivalent food or ingredient. The Council of
Ministers believes such information is only justified where there is a
"significant" difference with the traditional food.

The Conciliation Committee will have to settle the issue and, under the
context of co-decision procedure, draw up a compromise text for a proposal
for a Regulation on the marketing in the Community of novel foods and food
ingredients. In second reading on March 12, 1995, the European Parliament
adopted six amendments to the common position approved by the Council on
October 23, 1995. Compromise proposals are currently being examined and
the delegations may reach an agreement in the coming weeks.

This Regulation must guarantee that novel foods and food ingredients
present no risk to public health or the environment and are the object of
detailed labelling. It will also define procedures on the European level
for the marketing of these products throughout the Community. It says that
genetic engineering must only be used to improve the taste, flavour and
shelf life of products, or to protect against insect attack or ensure
resistance to herbicides.

DEREGULATING PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Just as France was reaffirming the importance of the inclusion of public
services in the Maastricht Treaty, at the European Council in Dublin on
October 5, Rome was hosting an International Forum on "the deregulation of
public and consumer services", organised on the initiative of the European
Commission and Italy's competition and markets authority. Following on
from its recent Communication on general interest services in Europe, the
Commission was anxious to relaunch the deregulation debate by emphasising
European citizens' interests (and expectations), in the presence of
representatives of institutions, industry, utilities and consumer
associations. Faced with the reticence of certain Member States and
sectors concerned, the Commission has put its faith in the
citizen-consumer to support the ongoing process. But the man in the street
still has to be convinced of the advantages to be gained from deregulating
public services, and reassured of the maintenance of "unalienable" general
interest services. The Rome meeting was intended at a first step towards
this goal.

CRESSON PUTS CASE FOR BETTER FOCUSED RESEARCH PROGRAMME

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

Addressing a gathering at the University of Bonn, in Germany, on October
16, Edith Cresson, the European Commissioner with responsibility for
Research, argued that the 5th European Framework Programme on Research and
Technological Development (RTD) (1999-2002) must not be a mere extension
of its predecessors. The Commissioner emphasised the importance of
evolving away from research focusing exclusively on technological
performance, and towards research focusing better on economic and social
needs. The Commission guidelines for the 5th Framework Programme were
presented in September in the form of a working paper ("Inventing
tomorrow") designed to launch the debate.

Mrs Cresson highlighted her own creed on European research policy which
should, first and foremost, serve the needs of society. She insisted this
goal is not at variance with the need for strong basic research in Europe:
contemporary research is indeed characterised by an increasingly rapid
convergence of theoretical breakthroughs and practical results.

Turning to the place of research/industry Task Forces in the 5th Framework
Programme, Mrs Cresson indicated they should in principle remain as
support structures for projects targeted at themes of great social and
economic importance. She also highlighted the relations between RTD
policy, regional and cohesion policy, an issue of much concern in Germany,
insisting that "while Union research actions can contribute directly to
strengthening the economic and social cohesion of different regions,
seeking to obtain this effect by sacrificing the criteria of scientific
excellence would be a grave error". It would, she argues, be more
appropriate to "coordinate the implementation of research programmes and
regional policy actions".

The European Commissioner recalled the timetable for the introduction of
the 5th Framework Programme:

- The Commission will present a more detailed working paper before the
year's end, describing in greater depth the scientific and technological
objectives to be pursued and the procedures for implementation; this
document will however remain sufficiently open to stimulate a genuine
policy debate on the options proposed.

- A formal proposal will be presented at the beginning of 1997, with a
view to its adoption at the beginning of 1998.

STEEL CANS RECYCLING RATE EXCEEDS 40%

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The recycling rate for steel cans in Europe reached 41% in 1995, an
increase of more than 20% in just one year, according to APEAL, the
Association of European Packaging Steel Producers. This puts the industry
well above the target of 15% for all materials set out in the Directive on
packaging and packaging wastes. The Association claims that about a
million tonnes of steel were collected and recycled last year. Germany is
setting the trend in Europe with a recycling rate of 67%, followed by the
Netherlands (58%), France (40%) and Belgium (30%). Spain and Britain are
trailing somewhat with 17 and 16% respectively. APEAL forecasts that
recycling rates will reach 65% by 2005. In Europe, food tins account for
50% of steel packaging, industrial packaging such as drums for 20%,
beverage cans 10%, aerosols 10%, and other objects 5%.

The members of APEAL are: the British Steel Tinplate (GB), Cockerill
Sambre (B), Corporacion Siderurgica Nacional (Sp), Hoogovens Packaging
Steel (Nl), ICMI (I), Norsk Blikkvalseverk (N), Rasselstein Hoesch (Ger),
Sollac (F).

EIB LENDS TURKEY ECU 50 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The European Investment Bank is lending ECU 50 million for an
environmental protection project in Turkey. The loan is being advanced to
Izmit Greater Municipality to help cover the cost of collection and
treatment of industrial effluents in the province of Kocaeli, one of the
most industrialised provinces in Turkey. The project will halt the
contamination of local rivers and thereby will help to protect and improve
water quality in the Gulf of Izmit (Marmara Sea). Financing is granted
under the environmental section of the "Off-Protocol Facility", benefiting
from a 3% interest subsidy from the Community Budget, under the EU's
Redirected Mediterranean Policy, designed to support investment in the
fields of regional cooperation and environment protection, developing
links at regional levels and with the Union's economy.

INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL OF THE SEA INVESTS JUDGES.

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The investiture of the 21 judges who are to sit on the International
Tribunal of the Sea, a United Nations institution set up to arbitrate
disputes over fishing, navigation and pollution, was held in the German
town of Hamburg on October 18. The ceremony was attended by UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who called on more countries to
sign the Tribunal's Charter. Notable exceptions include the United States
and Britain, while France and Russia have still to ratify the document.
The basis for the Tribunal's work, the Agreement on the Law of the Sea has
thus far been signed by 107 of the UN's 185 member countries. Mr
Boutros-Ghali explained that the Tribunal will be charged with
implementing provisional measures where the marine environment is
seriously threatened, and should lead to a more rapid resolution of
disputes over fisheries, navigation and pollution. It will also have the
power to order the release of impounded vessels, against the deposit of a
guarantee. The Tribunal's rulings will not be subject to appeal. Where
disputes arise, States will be free to appeal either to the Tribunal or to
the International Court of Justice in the Hague. The Tribunal is chaired
by Thomas Mensah of Ghana.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: MAKING A COME-BACK

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

The European Commission is said to be pondering the idea of resuscitating
a proposal that has been deeply buried for several years now and seeks to
ensure that the environment is taken into account at the start of the
decision-making chain. European Commissioner for the Environment Ritt
Bjerregaard is inciting her colleagues to adopt the draft environmental
impact assessment Directive for the policies, plans and programmes of the
Member States. It is scheduled to appear on the provisional agenda for the
Commissioners' October 30 meeting. The existing Directive on the
environmental impact assessment of public and private projects proposes an
impact assessment much further up the political decision-making chain. Mrs
Bjerregaard's new Directive is intended to ensure the Member States'
programmes and strategies are effectively vetted for their environmental
impact. Green MEPs and environmental protection lobbies have accused the
Commission of holding up the proposal, pending a decision on the major
trans-European transport networks, which they claim would by their very
nature contravene the proposal.

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY: COMMISSION RIGHT TO REFUSE CFC IMPORT LICENCE, SAYS
COURT

from EUROPE ENVIRONMENT, 22 October 1996, No. 486

In an October 16 ruling, the Court of First Instance of the European
Communities dismissed an appeal by Efisol of France against the European
Commission's refusal to grant it a licence to import chlorofluorocarbons
11 (CFC 11) in 1994. After obtaining an import quota of 1,800 tonnes of
CFCs for 1994, Efisol expected the Commission to grant it an import
licence as is usual following attribution of a quota. The Commission
declined to do so. Efisol, meanwhile, had already ordered and transported
some of the CFCs in question at a cost of over two million French Francs.
The Court found that Efisol had acted unwisely, but admitted that the
Commission had not acted entirely correctly either.

Under Regulation 594/91, trade within the EU of CFCs imported from third
countries is subject to quotas granted by the Commission to the firms in
question (CFCs are now banned in the EU). The quota, however, must be
supplemented by an import licence granted by the Commission for CFCs to be
imported. A firm desiring a licence must submit an application to the
Commission describing the substances it wishes to import, the quantity and
the use to which they will be put. The various possible uses provided for
on the application form include "feedstock in the manufacture of other
chemicals".

After an exchange of letters between Efisol and the Commission, the French
company indicated that the CFCs to be imported would be used as "feedstock
in the manufacture of other chemicals", specifically polyurethane foam.
The Commission did not react rapidly enough to the provision of what was
later found to be inaccurate or even erroneous information by Efisol. CFCs
are not completely destroyed or broken down during the manufacture of
polyurethane foam and therefore this process does not meet the definition
of the "manufacture of other chemicals". It was the French Ministry that
informed the Commission that the imported CFCs would not be used to
produce other chemicals.

Efisol placed orders with its Russian suppliers on February 17 and 20,
1994, only a few days after submitting its application for a licence on
February 15 and before it had received a response. On February 24, the
Commission informed Efisol of its refusal to grant the import licences.
One train was already rolling towards France carrying a cargo of CFCs 11
and another was headed for Russia to pick up another load. When informal
negotiations failed, Efisol demanded compensation for the costs of
transporting the first load and running the empty train and for lost
production and sales. The Commission claimed that Efisol had "attempted to
mislead the Commission as to the exact use to which the substances were to
be put" and had "purchased orders from its Russian supplier (...) before
the Commission denied the application for the licence". The parties are
also at loggerheads over the issue of whether a licence should
automatically be granted following the attribution of a quota. The
Commission considered the two separate actions.

The Court found against Efisol, which claimed that the Commission had
violated the principle of legitimate expectations, arguing that once the
quota had been allocated, the Commission was required to issue a licence.
The Court said that a "cautious and informed operator would not have
initiated rail transport of the cargoes ordered without waiting for the
Commission's decision and without taking the necessary steps to protect
its interests if its application for a licence was refused". The import
rights granted with the attribution of a quota become effective only when
the import licence is granted, the Court said. By placing orders only two
days after applying for a licence, the "the complainant put itself in
danger". The Court further ruled that it is scientifically inaccurate to
describe polyurethane foam as a "chemical". However, the Commission
"applied Community Regulations incorrectly" by granting Efisol a quota for
this type of use, the Court said. "The Commission's behaviour was not in
keeping with Community Regulations and thus could not have raised
justified hopes on the part of the complainant". Since "the emergence of
conflict was fuelled by the Commission's action", the Commission was
ordered to pay all the legal costs.
