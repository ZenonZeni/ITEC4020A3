<h2 align="center" src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
The two critical facts I need to know about a fertility patient
who is having irregular or absent periods are:<p>
<ol>
<li>Can you menstruate? 
<li>Can you ovulate?
</ol>
<P>
Once I've answered these questions, I have a good idea of what's
causing your fertility problem.
<P>
I'd like to share this information with you, as well as some of
the questions and concerns my patients have brought up from time
to time.
<P>
<B>What Makes You Have a Period?</B> <br>

Normally each month estrogen and progesterone stimulate the growth
of the uterine lining. When the progesterone-producing corpus
luteum deteriorates toward the end of the cycle, &quot;progesterone
withdrawal bleeding&quot; occurs: you have a period. Waves of
vasoconstriction (blood vessel spasms) restrict the blood supply
to the endometrium and thus provoke the onset of menses. At the
conclusion of menses, clotting factors seal off exposed bleeding
sites, and resumed estrogen production begins restoring the endometrium.
<P><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>Initial Tests</h2>
<P>
Several basic tests will help determine why your periods are abnormal.
Table 12-1, &quot;Diagnostic Approaches for Irregular Menstrual
Periods or Amenorrhea,&quot; which appears later in this chapter,
will give you an overview of the diagnostic approaches used to
determine if you are ovulating and the conditions that can interfere
with ovulation and menses.
<P>
<B>Pregnancy Test</B> 
<br>
This may seem surprising, but pregnancy is the single most common
reason for women reporting to me that their periods have stopped.
Before I initiate any type of fertility treatment, I conduct a
pregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy.
<P>
<B>Cervical Mucus Smear</B> 
<br>
Normally the cervical mucus is thick and relatively impervious
to the outer environment. Throughout the first half of the cycle,
increasing amounts of estrogen produced by the ovary cause the
mucus to &quot;fern.&quot; When placed on a slide and dried, the
estrogen-primed mucus crystals form a beautiful <a href="ch152.gif">fern-like pattern</a>.
Around the time of ovulation, high estrogen levels transform the
mucus into a clear, watery, viscous fluid that sperm can easily
transverse. After ovulation progesterone from the corpus luteum
&quot;opposes&quot; the action of the estrogen, and the mucus
once again thickens. I use this simple test to tell me if you've
ovulated during this cycle. If you have not yet ovulated, I will
observe the telltale ferning. I will then perform the progesterone
withdrawal test to find out if you are capable of menstruating.
<P>
<b>Vaginal Ultrasound</b><br>
 <img align=left src="ch121.jpg">Transvaginal ultrasound is a sample painless procedure that can be performed in less than 15 minutes. It provides helpful information that unlocks the clues to your ovulation problem.  This picture demonstrates a 12mm "triple-line" pattern indicating normal estrogen stimulation.  As your follicles develop and release estrogen, the uterine lining thickens and takes on a very specific appearance.  Immediately prior to ovulation in a natural cycle, the endometrium measures 8-12mm and
follicles reach 20-24mm, while if you are receiving ovulation medication follicles may be ready at 16-18mm.  After ovulation, the endometrial echo (shadow) becomes more opaque (white) indicating that the corpus luteum is now making progesterone.<p> If your ovaries are not making estrogen the endometrium will be thinner, 6mm or less and the ovaries will usually contain either many small follicles surrounding the margin of the ovary (polycystic ovaries) or no follicles at all. This may be due to ovarian failure or abnormal hormonal stimulation.  You will soon learn how I can decide which is causing your menstrual cycle problems.  <p>
<B>Progesterone Withdrawal Test</B><br> 

The <a name="progwith">progesterone</a> withdrawal test will confirm if your uterus is
capable of menstruating. If it is, then the cause of your menstrual
irregularity lies with your hormonal systems. If your uterus cannot
&quot;bleed,&quot; then the problem lies with the uterus itself.
<P>
I can bring on your period either by giving you oral progesterone
over a five- or ten-day period or by giving you a progesterone
injection. After taking the progesterone, your period should begin
within fourteen to twenty days.
<P>
<I><B>Positive Response to Progesterone Withdrawal</B></I> 
<br>
If progesterone withdrawal causes your period to start up, as
it did with Kathy S., I learn a number of things.
<P>
First, I know that your ovaries are producing enough estrogen
to build up your uterine lining. I also know that your uterus
is capable of responding to estrogen and progesterone stimulation.
Since your uterus is functioning normally, your fertility problem
lies somewhere in your hormonal system.
<P>
Second, you are failing to menstruate because you are failing
to ovulate. For some reason your pituitary is not producing the
LH spike necessary to release the ovum from your follicle.
<P>
Two conditions must exist before your pituitary will release an
LH surge: The follicles growing in your ovaries must release enough
estrogen to signal your pituitary that it's time to release the
LH surge-in other words, that at least one egg has reached maturity.
And your pituitary gland must be capable of generating the LH
spike.
<P>
I may suspect that your hypothalamus just isn't prodding your
pituitary well enough. If your follicles do not grow to maturity,
you'll never produce enough estrogen to trigger the LH spike to
release the egg and thus ovulate. A pituitary malfunction can
cause the same problem; however, in Kathy's case, I suspected
a hypothalamic insufficiency from excess running.
<P>
&quot;How can you be sure?&quot; Kathy asked.
<P>
&quot;Well, that's exactly what my next series of tests will show.
I want to make sure that other systems in your body are not adversely
affecting your hormonal system.&quot;
<P>
<i><b>Negative Response to Progesterone Withdrawal: Repeating the Progesterone
Withdrawal After Estrogen Stimulation </b></i>
<br>
Like Kathy, most women will &quot;bleed&quot; in response to progesterone
withdrawal. However, if you don't, it's possible that your estrogen
supply is not adequate to stimulate uterine lining growth. If
your uterus is normal, taking estrogen to prime the growth of
the uterine lining should guarantee that you'll have a period
after progesterone withdrawal. So we'll try it again-this time
giving you estrogen before the progesterone, just to be sure.
<P>
If the estrogen/progesterone-stimulated cycle fails to produce
a &quot;bleed,&quot; it means that your uterus cannot respond
to estrogen and progesterone stimulation: we've pinpointed your
uterus as the problem. My next step will be to examine the inside
of your uterus. (I'll discuss uterine abnormalities, <a name="http://www.mindspring.com/~mperloe/cme/hyst/hyscme84.html">hysteroscopy</a>, saline sonohysterography, D&amp;C, and <a name="http://www.mindspring.com/~mperloe/cme/hyst/hyscme25.html">uterine X-ray</a> procedures in <a name="ch16mb.html">chapters 16</a> and <a name="ch19mb.html">19</a>.)
<P>
<I><B>Positive Withdrawal to Estrogen/Progesterone Stimulation</B></I>
<br>
When you have a period after taking estrogen and progesterone,
I know that your uterus is capable of menstruating. The reason
you have not been menstruating is that your ovaries are not producing
adequate amounts of estrogen. At this stage in the diagnostic
procedures we don't know for certain why your ovaries are not
producing estrogen, but several possibilities exist:<p> <ol>
<dl><li>Your ovaries are not capable of producing estrogen, <p>
<li>Your hypothalamus is not stimulating your pituitary to release FSH and LH, which
control follicular development and estrogen production, <p>
<li>Your pituitary is unable to produce adequate amounts of LH and FSH,<p>
<li>Other hormonal imbalances are tricking your pituitary into
&quot;thinking&quot; that it's doing a good job when, in fact,
it is not.</dl></ol>
<P>
Since estrogen stimulation is vital for the growth of the uterine
lining, I will measure your estrogen hormone levels to confirm
this diagnosis before venturing into new diagnostic territories.
I'll may also do a cytology smear to look at estrogen stimulation
of your vaginal cells. In addition, I'll measure your FSH level
to rule out ovarian failure. (A high FSH level indicates that
the ovaries have been severely damaged or have run out of eggs.)
<P>
<B>Detecting Ovarian Failure</B> <br>
Ovarian failure occurs when your ovaries are severely damaged
or when they run out of eggs. When this happens, your pituitary
gland tries to force your ovary to manufacture estrogen and to
ovulate by working overtime to produce FSH. The pituitary gland's
signals fall on deaf ears, though, because the damaged ovaries
cannot respond to the extra FSH stimulation.
<P>
Ovarian failure may be caused by a number of conditions including
infection, chemical toxins, medications, radiation exposure, tumor, surgery, immunologic dysfunction
and genetic abnormalities. Unfortunately ovarian failure is rarely
reversible. However, ovarian failure due to infection or endometriosis
will sometimes respond to treatment. Since a diagnosis of ovarian
failure can be distressing, I always repeat the FSH test before
recommending donor eggs or other alternatives.
<h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2><P>
<h2 align=center>Diagnosing Anovulation</h2>

<I>Once we've ruled out uterine abnormalities and ovarian failure,
we've confirmed that your periods are irregular because you are
not ovulating (anovulation). </I>For some reason your pituitary
is not sending adequate amounts of LH and FSH to your ovaries.
However, I have good news: the failure to ovulate, which affects
25 percent of infertile women, responds very well to treatment.
<P>
<B>Symptoms of Anovulation</B> <br>

Although a few anovulatory women will have normal periods, most
will have few or no periods at all (amenorrhea). Prolonged or
heavy periods (menorrhagia), spotting during the middle of the
cycle (metrorrhagia), and prolonged spotting may also occur. Women
with anovulatory menstrual periods do not experience the typical
menstrual discomforts often found in ovulatory women: breast soreness,
mood changes, or cramping. The anovulatory woman's BBT chart will
be flat (monophasic) and her cervical mucus will fern, indicating
that progesterone (produced by the corpus luteum that forms after
ovulation) never opposes the estrogen stimulation.
<P>
<B>Tests Used to Determine the Cause of Anovulation</B> 
<br>
In the next phase of testing I try to determine why your pituitary
gland is not stimulating your ovaries to ovulate. I need to answer
a number of questions:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Is your hypothalamus not &quot;beating the drum&quot; by producing regular pulses of GnRH?<p>

<li>Is your pituitary gland damaged?<p>

<li>Is your pituitary gland getting misleading feedback messages about
ovarian function?
</ul>
<p>
Several tests will give me the additional answers I need. Tables
12-1, &quot;Diagnostic Approaches for Irregular Menstrual Periods
or Amenorrhea,&quot; and 12-2, &quot;Hormonal Tests for Diagnosing
the Cause of Anovulation,&quot; profile which tests I may order.

<i><h2 align=center><i>Hormonal Tests for Diagnosing the Cause of Anovulation</i></u></h2></i>
<dl>
<dt><b>Prolactin Pituitary Hormone
</b>

<dd>Excessive prolactin can suppress pituitary output (LH and FSH)
and can act directly on the ovary to suppress follicular growth.
<P>
<dt><B>Thyroid Hormone</B> 

<dd>Hyper- and hypothyroidism can interfere with hormonal metabolism
(the rate at which hormones are used up by the body) and with
the delicate hormonal balance between the pituitary and ovary.
In addition, through an intriguing mechanism (explained later)
hypothyroidism may contribute to excess prolactin production.
<P>
<dt><B>FSH and LH Pituitary Hormones</B> 

<dd>Elevated FSH almost always indicates ovarian failure. If FSH and
LH are depressed, I suspect one of three things: that a faulty
hormonal feedback mechanism is inappropriately telling the pituitary
to cut back production; that the hypothalamus is not &quot;beating
the drum&quot; to stimulate the pituitary to function; or that
a pituitary inadequacy prevents the gland from functioning normally.
<P>
<dt><B>Adrenal Androgens (DHEAS and Testosterone)</B> 

<dd>In the presence of excessive hair (hirsutism) or male secondary
sex characteristics (enlarged clitoris or ambiguous genitalia),
elevated male hormone (testosterone), elevated DHEAS, or elevated
adrenal androgens may indicate a congenital enzymatic defect,
polycystic ovaries, or a tumor in the pituitary gland, adrenal
gland, or ovary. Testosterone or adrenal androgens can suppress
ovulation as well as cause a number of other problems discussed
later.</dl><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>

<P>
<B>Solving the Mystery of Anovulation</B> <br>

Twenty percent of ovulation failures result from stress, obesity,
diet excessive androgen production, thyroid gland dysfunction,
or excess prolactin. In the sections that follow, I will explain
how these conditions can be identified and treated to resolve
fertility problems. <a href="ch14mb.html">Chapter 14</a> describes ovulation induction treatment,
which I may use if you have idiopathic anovulation (unknown cause)
and which I may also use with some of the conditions discussed
below.
<P>
<B>Coming Off the Pill</B> 
<br>
Let me lay one fear to rest. It's very unlikely that oral contraceptives
cause amenorrhea or anovulation. Oh, but you say, when you stopped
the Pill, your periods never returned. Or perhaps they returned
but were irregular and spotty.
<P>
To that I must ask, &quot;What were your periods like before you
took the Pill?&quot; Usually the answer is &quot;My periods were
irregular. But I've had regular periods ever since I began taking
the Pill.&quot;
<P>
So what's happening? Oral contraceptives do suppress ovulation;
however, your uterine lining continues to cycle between development
and shedding. Can you guess why you have a period? You may already
know that the Pill contains estrogen and progesterone. When you
stop taking the Pill for one week each month, you experience estrogen
and progesterone withdrawal, and so you begin to menstruate. Something
else happens that's also logical. You don't cramp, you don't bloat,
and you don't become depressed-and that's because you don't ovulate.
(Women who do cramp and bloat on the Pill may have other problems,
which should be discussed with their physician.)
<P>
Each year thousands of women go off the Pill, and within two to
four months they begin ovulating. If it is their goal, they soon
become pregnant. However, a few women stop the Pill and resume
an abnormal menstrual pattern, which may indicate that they are
not ovulating.
<P>
For some it's possible that a fertility problem arose while they
were taking the Pill. The cyclical action of the Pill may have
masked the symptoms (menstrual irregularities) until they stopped
taking it. This is why some doctors recommend that you stop taking
the Pill for a few months every couple of years: to see if everything
is still working normally. I do not recommend this practice, however,
since one frequent side effect of this procedure is pregnancy.
To me it does not make any more sense to go off the Pill every
couple of years than to stop using condoms to see if you can still
get pregnant.
<P>
The few women who do become anovulatory as a direct result of
using the Pill usually respond very well to ovulation induction
treatment with clomiphene <font size="-1">(<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mperloe/clom.html">Serophene/Clomid</a>)</font>. (<a href="ch14mb.html">Chapter 14</a> describes how Serophene can be used to restore ovulation.)
<P>
<B>Hypothalamic Malfunction</B> 
<br>
We suspect that a number of conditions may adversely affect hypothalamic
performance: <a href="strshtml.html">emotional stress</a>, endorphins (nature's painkillers,
which are synthesized by the brain in response to stress and pain),
extreme exercise (<a href="amenath.html">amenorrhea athletica</a>), dieting, poor nutrition,
weight loss, low body fat, anorexia, and drugs, toxins, or medications.
I discussed many of these conditions in <a href="ch9mb.html">chapter 9</a>.
<P>
We cannot directly measure hypothalamic performance: we don't
know for sure if the drum is beating. Sometimes, though, we can
measure the <I>results </I>of insufficient hypothalamic stimulation.
For example, we can test for low LH, FSH, and estrogen levels
as described in <a href="ch12mb.html#table122">table 12-2</a>. However, often the changes are too
subtle to detect.
<P>
Except for estrogen, the test results for Kathy S., for example,
were all normal. When I discovered this finding, I had to assume
that, as a result of her excessive running (stress), Kathy's hypothalamus
was not pulsing GnRH in a manner sufficient to stimulate her pituitary.
As a result, her pituitary was not properly stimulating follicular
growth, her ovaries did not produce enough estrogen, and she did
not ovulate. When I prescribed Serophene to enhance her hypothalamic
activity, she began to ovulate. You'll learn more about Kathy's
experience with ovulation induction in <a href="ch14mb.html">chapter 14</a>.
<P>
<B>Pituitary Gland Malfunction</B> 
<br>
Hormones from the pituitary gland control a number of &quot;chemical
factories&quot; throughout your body: your adrenal gland, your
thyroid gland, and your ovaries, to mention a few. When your pituitary
malfunctions, many different systems can break down. The single
most common end result, however, is an excess production of prolactin
(hyperprolactinemia).
<P>
<a name="prolactin"><b><I>Hyperprolactinemia</a> </I></b><br>Nearly 10 percent of women with irregular
periods and 20 percent of women with no obvious cause for amenorrhea
have elevated prolactin levels. One-third of these women may have
a milky discharge from their breasts (galactorrhea) and one-third
of them will have a pituitary tumor (adenoma). Almost always benign,
these tumors respond well to drug therapy (bromocriptine) and
to surgery. You may wish to refer to table 12-3, &quot;Factors
Causing Elevated Prolactin Levels,&quot; for an overview.
<P><DL>
<dt><B><a href="amenath.html">Excessive Exercise</a>, Stress, or Suckling</B> 
<br>
<dd>Excessive stress and/or exercise may cause hyperprolactinemia.
In addition, nursing a baby will release prolactin, nature's birth
control hormone. When you stop nursing, relieve the source of
your stress, or take Parlodel (bromocriptine), your prolactin
levels will drop and ovulation will return.
<P>
<a name="hypothyroidism"><dt><B>Hypothyoroidism</B></a>
<br>
<dd>When your thyroid hormone production drops below normal, an intriguing
chemical process leads to excess prolactin. Your hypothalamus
also controls thyroid hormone levels by producing TRH (thyroid-releasing
hormone) which tells your pituitary to make TSH (thyroid-stimulating
hormone). When your thyroid gland cannot respond to these chemical
signals, your hypothalamus senses that there isn't enough thyroid
hormone around, so it produces more TRH, saying, &quot;Get to
work. We need more thyroid hormone.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Due to a unique chemical association, TRH also tells your pituitary
to release more prolactin. The excess prolactin not only interferes
with pituitary function but also exerts a direct inhibitory effect
on the ovary itself. Taking a thyroid supplement to quiet your
hypothalamus will usually correct this chemical imbalance and
restore ovulation.
<P>
<dt><B>Elevated Adrenal Androgens (DHEAS)</B> 
<br>
<dd>We also find elevated adrenal androgens (male hormones) in one-third
of women with excess prolactin. I'll discuss how these hormones
can interfere with ovulation in the section on hormonal feedback
below.
<P>
<dt><B>Severe Kidney Disease</B> 
<br>
<dd>Severe kidney disease, which impairs the body's ability to purify
and filter the blood, may also result in the buildup of prolactin
hormone. Dialysis, kidney transplants, or better management of
the kidney disease may restore fertility to these women. The discussion
on hepatorenal disease below will tell more about managing this
disorder.
<P>
<dt><B>Medications</B> 
<br>
<dd>Certain medications may increase prolactin levels: phenothiazines
and other tranquilizers; tricyclic antidepressants; methyldopa
(Aldomet, an antihypertensive); Reserpine (antihypertensive);
and narcotics. When these drugs are withdrawn, prolactin levels
will return to normal. If you are concerned about a particular
medication that you are taking, discuss it with your doctor.

<B>Treatment for Hyperprolactinemia</B> 
<br>
The nature of your treatment depends on the cause of the elevated
prolactin. Table 12-4, &quot;Treatment for Hyperprolactinemia,&quot;
explains a number of treatment options. Except for obvious systemic
problems such as thyroid inadequacy and kidney failure, I usually
prescribe Parlodel to lower prolactin levels. Parlodel will also
reduce pituitary tumor size, should one be present. An oral medication
taken with meals, Parlodel as few side effects, is relatively
inexpensive, and-should you get pregnant-will not adversely affect
your baby. Women with hyperprolactinemia respond well to this
medication and their fertility usually returns quite quickly.

<P>
<B>Damaged Pituitary Gland</B> 
<br>
If your pituitary gland has been damaged by surgery, tumor, radiation
therapy, and/or excessive bleeding during childbirth (Sheehan's
syndrome), it may not be able to produce LH and FSH hormones in
adequate amounts. To restore function to your ovaries, and your
fertility, I must replace these hormones. Pergonal/Humegon/Puregon (LH and FSH) and Metrodin (FSH)
are common medications used for this purpose. (See <a href="ch14mb.html">chapter
14</a>.)
<P>
<B>Cushing's Disease</B> 
<br>
Though rare, Cushing's disease is characterized by elevated adrenal stimulating 
hormone (ACTH) secreted from a pituitary tumor. If you have this
disease, you will have excess androgens (male hormones) and possibly
excess prolactin (found in 20 percent of women with Cushing's
disease). To diagnose this condition, I ask my patients to take a low dose steroid pill at bedtime and I check a cortisol level early the next morning. If detected, this condition can often be corrected by surgically
removing the pituitary tumor.  
<P>
<B>Empty Sella Syndrome</B> 
<br>
Empty sella syndrome occurs when spinal fluid leaks into the bony
chamber (fossa) housing your pituitary gland. Empty sella syndrome
may happen because of a congenital weakness, surgery, trauma,
or a pituitary tumor. When pressure from the spinal fluid compresses
the pituitary gland against the bony walls of the fossa, you may
lose LH- and FSH-producing cells, and you may lose your fertility.
Lowering your prolactin levels with Parlodel (bromocriptine) and
supplementing your LH and FSH levels with gonadotropins (FSH+/-LH)
should correct your fertility problem.<h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center><P>
Hormonal Feedback Problems Affecting Your Pituitary Gland</h2>

Many systems in your body can trick your pituitary gland into
producing fewer ovarian stimulants. Like production supervisors,
your hypothalamus and pituitary gland monitor ovarian performance
by sensing levels of estrogen and other chemicals circulating
in your blood. In this way the pituitary knows when to speed up
or slow down ovarian production. However, when other hormones
get out of balance, the feedback messages from your ovaries become
distorted and your hypothalamus and pituitary gland respond inappropriately.
When this happens, your periods become irregular and you stop
ovulating.
<P>
<B>Hepatorenal Disease</B> 
<br>
Hepatorenal diseases affect your body's ability to filter impurities
from your blood. Both your liver <I>(hepato-) </I>and your kidneys
<I>(-renal) </I>remove toxins and &quot;old&quot; hormones from
your system. If estrogen or adrenal androgens (see discussion
of adrenal disease below) are allowed to build up in your blood,
they tell the pituitary, &quot;Stop stimulating the ovaries. Don't
send out any more LH and FSH.&quot; The hypothalamus mistakenly
thinks that your elevated estrogen supply is coming from ripening
follicles. When the pituitary responds to this message by slowing
down FSH production, your immature follicles fail to develop and
you stop ovulating.
<P>
If you have this problem, artificial blood filtration methods
such as dialysis may not be adequate to restore your fertility.
Pregnancy may not be advisable, however, since it may place an
undue strain on your already compromised physical condition. Once
your physician arrests the disease and the filtration systems
work, your fertility will return.
<P>
<B>Adrenal Disease (DHEAS)</B> 
<br>
Adrenal diseases usually cause two feedback problems: both excess
adrenal androgens and, in 30 percent of these cases, excess prolactin
(see above) will lower LH and FSH production and cause anovulation.
Several different conditions may contribute to DHEAS elevation:<p>
<ul>
<li>Psychological or physical stress
<P>
<li>Pituitary, ovarian, or adrenal tumors
<P>
<li>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (an inherited disorder)</ul>
<P>
Fortunately 30 to 40 percent of the women having mild DHEAS elevation
will respond to ovulation induction therapy, without my having
to treat the basic cause of the DHEAS elevation. If your prolactin
hormone is also elevated, Parlodel will reduce both your prolactin
and androgen levels
<P>
Women with high androgen levels will show signs of virilization,
such as growing a mustache (hirsutism). In these cases I must
find out what's causing the elevated androgens and treat this
condition. Elevated adrenal androgens are associated with Cushing's
syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or polycystic ovaries.
<P>
<B>Cushing's Syndrome</B> 
<br>
Cushing's syndrome, another rare disorder, can be identified by
the presence of &quot;buffalo hump&quot; (characteristic lump
of excess fat located between the shoulder blades), water retention
(edema), high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, weakness,
bruising, moon face, acne, hirsutism, and menstrual dysfunction.
If you have these classic symptoms, I'll run a test to determine
if you have an androgen-secreting tumor. If you do not have a
tumor, low-dose cortisol medication will get your adrenal androgen
production under control and your fertility will return. If the
test shows you do have a tumor, surgical removal of the tumor
will restore your ability to ovulate.
<P>
<B>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</B> 
<br>
The classic symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia include
significant androgen excess, excessive hair growth, and an enlarged
clitoris (clitoromegaly). If you have this inherited disorder,
you may be shorter than your peers and you may have a family history
of this disease
<P>
Because of an enzyme deficiency, you cannot make cortisol. So
the chemicals that your body normally uses to synthesize cortisol
build up, and your body uses them to make androgens. The excess
levels of androgens suppress ovulation. <p>
I can screen for this disorder with a simple blood test for 17-hydroxyprogesterone.  The results may lead me to give you an injection of ACTH into your vein and repeating the blood test.  <p> 
I can treat this disorder by supplementing your cortisol supply. When I replace your missing
hormone, you will stop pumping out the chemicals to make cortisol
and your androgen levels will return to normal When this happens,
you will begin to ovulate. I will continue to supplement your
cortisol supply throughout your pregnancy, with no risk to your
baby.
<P>
<B>Polycystic Ovaries</B> 
<br>
<a href="pco.html">Polycystic ovaries</a> occur in 4 percent of women. Women having polycystic
ovaries are frequently but not necessarily obese, have few if any menstrual periods,
and have abnormal hair growth, which increases with the passage
of time. Polycystic ovaries are frequently associated with:
<P><ul>
<li>Ovarian or adrenal dysfunction
<P>
<li>Ovarian or adrenal tumors
<p>
<li>Insulin Resistance (Pre-diabetes)
<P>
<li>Adrenal hyperplasia
<P>
<li>Cushing's disease
<P>
<li>Hyperprolactinemia
<P>
<li>Thyroid disorders</ul>
<P>
Although many different conditions may cause polycystic ovaries,
the basic mechanism for excess androgen production appears to
be the same. The theca cells in the ovary make androgen. (You
may want to refer to the illustrations of the female reproductive
tract and <a href="ch111.gif">hormone system</a>.) Normally the follicular
(granulosa) cells convert this androgen to estrogen. When this
chemical process fails, androgens build up, the follicle fails
to mature fully, and the immature ovum remains trapped in the
ovary. As the next menstrual cycle begins, last month's deteriorated,
malfunctioning follicle continues to manufacture androgens. This
local supply of male hormone now interferes with new follicular
growth.
<P>
Month after month follicles form, fail to rupture, and continue
producing androgens until the ovary becomes cystic and can no
longer function. If I could see these ovaries, they would appear
enlarged, smooth, and pearly white: a result of long-term LH stimulation
without subsequent ovulation.
<P>
When I find your LH level higher than your FSH level, I can be
almost certain you have polycystic ovaries. If you are thin, laboratory
tests will probably indicate that you also have elevated DHEAS
and normal estrogen levels. If you are obese, I will probably
find that you have elevated estrogens, because your fat cells
are converting your excess DHEAS to estrogen. Thirty to 40 percent
of the women with polycystic ovaries will also have elevated prolactin,
and many will have abnormally high DHEAS and other androgen levels.
If androgen levels are extremely high, I will look for an adrenal
or ovarian tumor. <p>
 I may find a darkening of your skin under your arms, beneath your breasts and on the nape of your neck.  This discoloration, called acanthosis nigricans, may indicate a condition called <a name="hairan">HAIR-AN syndrome</a>. (<b><font size="+1">h</font></b>yper<b><font size="+1">a</font></b>ndrogenism<b><font size="+1"> i</font></b>nsulin<b><font size="+1"> r</font></b>esistance <b><font size="+1">a</font></b>canthosis <b><font size="+1">n</font></font></b>igricans).  While the exact reason that elevated insulin levels interfere with ovulation is not yet known many theories exist.  And, we do know that women with elevated insulin levels usually are obese and have elevated androgen levels.  While exercise, diet and weight loss are the mainstays for treating this disorder, a new drug, <a name="metform.html">Metformin</a>, offers promise.
<P>
We no longer recommend the wedge resection (removal of part of
the ovary) once performed for polycystic ovaries. Although this
procedure often temporarily restores fertility by reducing the
amount of androgen production, the surgery permanently reduces
your fertility potential by removing egg-filled tissues. In addition,
there's a significant risk for adhesion formation, which can also
impair fertility.
<P>
If you are undergoing laparoscopy I can use lasers or electrosurgical needles 
to&quot;shoot&quot; cystic follicles and destroy their androgen-producing
capabilities. This surgical procedure may correct an ovulation for a short period of time allowing you to conceive without ovulation induction medication.  Unfortunately, after three or four months your ovulation abnormality will return if you do not conceive.
<P>
Although many women with polycystic ovaries will respond to Serophene
other more potent and expensive ovulation induction techniques are often required. You may also require
Parlodel and/or cortisol to lower prolactin and androgen levels. If you have polycystic ovaries, you have a good chance for pregnancy, but finding the ovulation induction scheme that works best for you requires careful planning and monitoring.  As I monitor your cycles, I may be forced to change medications or dosages or even cancel a cycle.  After you have completed a treatment cycle, my nurse practitioner and I will review your treatment and, if you do not conceive a plan will be established for another cycle. I'll discuss more about ovulation induction in <a href="ch14mb.html">chapter 14</a>.
<P>
<B>Hypo/hyperthyroidism</B> 
<br>
Hypo/hyperthyroidism also distorts the hormonal feedback mechanism.
Too little thyroid production <I>(hypo-) </I>may cause two fertility
problems: increased prolactin levels and persistent estrogen stimulation.
(See &quot;Hyperprolactinemia&quot; above.) Hypothyroidism slows
down your metabolism and causes &quot;old&quot; estrogens to build
up in your blood. This persistent estrogen stimulation tricks
your hypothalamus into believing that your ovary is producing
enough estrogen, so it tells your pituitary to reduce LH and FSH
stimulation. When this happens, your follicles fail to mature
and your ovaries do not produce enough estrogen to trigger the
LH spike necessary for ovulation. A thyroid hormone supplement
will lower your prolactin levels and improve your estrogen metabolism.  If your thyroid is underactive, I will check for antibodies that attack your thyroid gland. 
<P>
When your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism),
your increases and prematurely burns up your estrogen supply so
you become hypoestrogenic: you don't have enough estrogen. Since
the pituitary never senses that your follicle has reached maturity
(signaled by elevated estrogen), it does not release the LH spike
to trigger ovulation. Oddly enough, taking a thyroid supplement
may turn off the o veractive thyroid gland and return thyroid
hormone levels to normal, so that normal ovulatory cycles resume.
Surgery to remove the overactive thyroid gland is sometimes necessary.

<P>
<B>Obesity</B> 
<br>
Obesity can also lead to<a href="#hairan"> insulin resistance</a> and persistent estrogen stimulation. The
large number of fat cells in women weighing over two hundred pounds
manufacture enough estrogen to interfere with the ovary-pituitary
feedback system. The elevated estrogen tells the hypothalamus
and pituitary to stop stimulating follicular development. When
you reduce your weight through dieting and a moderate exercise
program, fertility will resume. 
<P>
The successful treatment of hormonal feedback problems affecting
the hypothalamus and pituitary gland generally results in pregnancy.
Sometimes these women may also require ovulation induction techniques,
discussed in <a href="ch14mb.html">chapter 14</a>.
<P>
<B>Ovarian Abnormalities </B>
<br>
Cysts, tumors, infections, and endometriosis can interfere with
the delicate hormonal balance of the ovary and depress follicle
development. Surgical removal of abnormal tissues (cysts, tumors, and endometriosis)
will often restore ovarian function. Although antibiotic therapy
will clear up the infections and restore ovulation I frequently
become concerned about the condition of the fallopian tubes following
an infection. I'll discuss more about resolving tubal problems
in <a href="ch16mb.html">chapter 16</a>.
<P>

<I><B><a name="pof">Premature Ovarian Failure</a> </B></I><br>Premature ovarian failure
simply means that the ovaries run out of follicles. For unknown
reasons some women go through menopause at an early age. There's
evidence that a few of these women may have developed an autoimmune
reaction to their own ovarian tissue. When this occurs, antibodies
form, attack the ovaries, and destroy vital structures. Other reasons include: surgery, trauma, radiation, and chromosomal. Unfortunately, most of the time we do not know why the ovaries fail prematurely. We can
confirm this diagnosis by finding elevated FSH levels.
<P>
Unfortunately, when you run out of eggs, you cannot make a baby.
However, there are new technologies (<a href="oocivfpr.html">oocyte donation</a>) that allow you to experience a normal pregnancy and give birth to a baby.  I'll talk more about these wondrous possibilities
in <a href="ch21mb.html">chapter 21</a>.

<B>A Note of Concern</B> 
<P>
If you have amenorrhea or early menopause, I'd like to caution
you that you may be at risk for bone decalcification (<a name="osteo.html">osteoporosis</a>).
Estrogen is vital for the maintenance of good bone structure.
The estrogen-deficient athlete (10 to 50 percent of athletic women),
for example, will suffer significant bone deterioration within
one to three years. Even if pregnancy is not your goal, you may
need to supplement your estrogen supply to prevent fractures and
irreversible bone damage. Check with your doctor.
