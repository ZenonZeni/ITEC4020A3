<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Sea of Cortez</H3>  

<P>
<P>This 1,070
km long ocean trench off Baja California harbors more than 875
species of fish, 176 species of marine and coastal birds, and
 a porpoise that
is found nowhere else in the world. 

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/MESO/Pelican.jpg" ALT="Pelican.jpg - 7.4 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>The Sea of Cortez once supported
a thriving fishing fleet that provided 60 percent of Mexico's
total fish catch. Recently, though, overfishing, pollution, and
adverse climatic conditions have sharply reduced the haul.  Marine
diversity is threatened, and many local fishermen are idle.  CI
is working with those who know the seacoast the best--local fishers--to
explore economic alternatives to destructive fishing practices.
 Focusing on communities bordering the new Upper Gulf of California
Biosphere Reserve, in 1995, CI helped a number of groups--including
one women's group--set up Mexico's first scallop farms. Other
initiatives, like fishing techniques that target desired species
and let others go, are being tested. Bringing years of research
to bear, CI's staff is also designing a conservation action plan
for the entire Sea of Cortez, including the Colorado River, Midriff
Islands, wetlands, and coastal zones.   CI's public awareness
campaign promotes marine conservation in communities all along
the gulf, using innovative means like environmental comic books
and theater performances.

<STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Overfishing and inappropriate fishing techniques; water contamination from urban areas, industry, and agriculture.

The Sea of Cortez in northwest Mexico ranks among the biologically richest one percent of all the world's ocean areas.  CI's conservation solutions in the Sea of Cortez include:





<UL>
<LI>developing a participatory management plan for the newly declared Upper Gulf of California/Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve;

<LI>implementing an environmental education program in local schools, communities, and with the fishing industry;

<LI>studying the effects of diminished fresh water flow from the Colorado River; and, 

<LI>developing aquaculture projects as an economic alternative for fishermen. 
</UL>

<H3>Selva Lacandona</H3>

<P>
The 385,000 hectare Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve protects the
largest remaining block of lowland tropical forest in Mexico.
 Though it covers a mere 0.16 percent of the nation's territory,
the reserve contains nearly 50 percent of all known species in
Mexico.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/MESO/Kids.jpg" ALT="Kids.jpg - 5.2 K" WIDTH=131 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>Since the Zapatista Revolution of early 1994, political
unrest in Chiapas has prompted land-hungry farmers to surge into
the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve and the forested lands of
the Lacandon community.  CI's biological stations in the reserve
have established a conservation presence in the region, and CI
is working with all parties--indigenous groups, settlers, and
government representatives -- to mediate land disputes.   CI staff
are also helping to create economic opportunities -- such as butterfly
ranching and new food crops -- that offer alternatives to slash-and-burn
agriculture and cattle-ranching. 
<P>
<STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Colonization; inappropriate agricultural techniques; conversion of forests for ranching and agriculture; illegal logging.</I>
<P>

The Selva Lacandona, in Mexico's southernmost state, is North America's last major expanse of tropical wet forest. CI's conservation solutions in the Selva Lacandona include:  



<UL>
<LI>selecting and analyzing natural products for market potential; 

<LI>working with the Lacandon Indians to demarcate the Lacandon Community Forest;  

<LI>conducting an inventory of the flora and fauna, planning land-use classification, and building a visitor's field station in the Lagunas de Ocotal region; and, 

<LI>continuing the development of a geographic information system, and providing technical support for tracking land tenure, forest cover, and population patterns.
