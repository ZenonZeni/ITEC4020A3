<td><font size=+2><p align=center><b>Travel Information</b></font>
<p><font size=+1><b>Health:</b><br>
No inoculations are required to travel to Costa Rica.  A well-equipped first aid kit including oxygen is on board.  You may want to bring anti-seasickness medicine if you feel you will need it.

<p>Please inform us and especially the dive guides if you are taking medication or suffer from allergies.

<p>There is no smoking allowed inside the boat.  Smoking is permitted on the sundeck only.


<p><font size=+1><b>Travel Documents:</b><br>
All passengers must have a valid passort for entry to Costa Rica. Non U.S. residents must check with the Costa Rican consulate if visas are necessary prior to travel.

<p><b>Clothing:</b><br>
We recommend casual and cool cotton attire while on board.  Nights can be chilly and/or drizzly.  A sweater, light jacket or windbreaker should be sufficient on a cool evening.  In San Jose dress is slightly more formal - long pants for men in the evening and a dress or pant suit for women is appropriate.  Puntarenas is generally very warm and shorts are acceptable.  We suggest packing in a soft duffle bag for easy luggage storage.

<p><font size=+1><b>Currency:</b><br>
Hotels and banks will accept and exchange US Dollars for Costa Rican Colones.  US dollars as well as travellers checks are accepted on the Undersea Hunter and Sea Hunter.  We do not accept personal checks.

<p><font size=+1><b>Baggage Limitations:</b><br>
Pack lightly since you will be dressing for warm tropical weather.  Airlines' baggage limitations can affect divers and photographers.  Domestic airlines limit passengers to two pieces of check-in luggage.  International flights also have a two piece limit and a limit of 70 lbs per bag.  You will be charged for an extra bag or overweight luggage.

<p><font size=+1><b>D.A.N. Insurance:</b><br>
We strongly urge all clients to obtain the inexpensive D.A.N. insurance designed to evacuate divers in the event of an accident.

<p>Cocos Island is a very remote area and the cost involved in evacuating a diver is very high.  The D.A.N. policy, priced at $52.00 per year is a vital protection to have.


<p><font size=+1><b>Insurance:</b><br>
We recommend the purchase of a short term cancellation insurance policy in case of unexpected changes in your plans.  Accident, medical and baggage insurance are also recommended.  The nearest recompression chamber is in Panama and the cost of evacuation is extremely high, we therefore recommend emergency evacuation insurance.

<p><font size=+1><b>National Park Fee:</b><br>
There is a National Park fee of $105.00 per person for seven days of diving.  This must be included with your final payment.
