<H3>Sumner and Laura Foster Library</H3>

The <A HREF="">Sumner and Laura Foster Library</A>
combines the library collections of
the Department of Economics and the School of Public Policy.  Housed on
the second floor of Lorch Hall, the Foster Library's primary purpose is
to serve the faculty and graduate students in the two units. The Foster
Library's collection focuses on materials in the field of international
development, public policy, and economics.  While the majority of the
collection is comprised of journals and working papers collected from
the U.S. and abroad, it also contains books, dissertations, reference
works, and foreign and U.S. government documents.  In addition to
providing access to library materials and maintaining its collection,
the Foster Library offers reference and information services, casual
reading and study areas, and course reserve materials.

<A HREF="http://rsqe.econ.lsa.umich.edu/">
<H3>Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics</H3>
</A>

The Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE) is an integral
component of the econometrics program in the Department of Economics. 
The Seminar provides the student with an opportunity to combine the
study of econometric theory with the practice available from an ongoing
research project in econometric analysis.  The RSQE sponsors two
principal activities in which qualified students are welcomed as
participants and through which Research Assistant appointments are
available.  One activity is centered around the RSQE's econometric
models of the U. S. economy and the economy of the State of Michigan and
includes 1) a forecasting program which produces quarterly forecasts of
the economy, 2) a program of structural and policy studies concerned
with the dynamics of the economy as represented by the econometric
model, and 3) continual research aimed at improving the specification of
the models.  The other principal activity involves basic research on
econometric technique and its application to substantive economic
problems.  General supervision of seminar projects is provided by the
faculty associated with the RSQE. Doctoral dissertations are frequently
generated by the research carried out under RSQE auspices.

<H3>Center for Research on Economic and Social Theory</H3>

The Center for Research on Economic and Social Theory (CREST) serves as
the central forum for those faculty and students whose primary interest
is in economic theory.  CREST holds weekly seminars in which original
research of resident faculty and students or innovative work in economic
theory which has recently appeared in the economic literature is
discussed.  Many of the papers discussed in the seminar are subsequently
duplicated and distributed as CREST discussion papers to members of
Economics departments at other universities. The Center also brings to
Michigan a number of guest lecturers from other universities.  Although
it is located in the Economics Department, membership in CREST is not
limited to economists, but includes members of the Mathematics,
Political Science, and Philosophy departments as well.

<H3>Research Seminar in International Economics</H3>

The seminar is a research and training facility located in the Department
of Economics.  The seminar program includes the formulation of international
economic theory, the empirical testing of hypotheses implied by the theory, the
measurement of quantitative international economic relations, and the analysis of
evaluation of significant problems of policy and the operation of international
economic institutions.  The seminar meets weekly under the direction of
Professors Stern, Deardorff, and Levinsohn.  Research results usually are
published in journals or edited volumes.

<H3>Area Centers</H3>

The University engages actively in certain Area Studies, with special
emphasis on China, Japan, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Western
Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and the Near East and North Africa.  A
variety of programs and courses is offered covering economic, political,
historical, and cultural studies of these areas.  In the Department of
Economics, Prof. Li has worked on issues relevant to both Chinese and
Eastern European economic issues, and Prof. Adams specializes in Western
Europe, especially France.  Prof. Porter has done field work in
Colombia, Pakistan, Kenya, Indonesia, and India.  Prof. Saxonhouse
specializes in the Japanese economy. In addition, many other faculty
have worked in particular countries at one time or another. 
Interdepartmental seminars are carried on in several of these areas.

<H3>Japan Economy Program</H3>

The Department of Economics maintains the national headquarters of the
Committee on Japanese Economic Studies which is chaired by Professor
Saxonhouse and which has received extensive funding from foundations and
corporations in both Japan and the United States.  At Michigan, the
Committee sponsors the Japan Economy Program.  Graduate student
participation in the research and training activities of the Japan
Economy Program is encouraged through special seminars and research
assistantships.  For students with fluency in Japanese or the aptitude
and inclination to undergo further language training, a limited number
of multi-year fellowships are available. During the past few years, the
Department of Economics has received a number of grants designed to
facilitate the training of specialists on the Japanese economy.  For
further details, contact Professor Saxonhouse (313-764-3296).


<H3>Center for Russian and East European Studies and Center for Chinese
Studies</H3>

The Center for Russian and East European Studies and the Center for
Chinese Studies provide a comprehensive multi-disciplinary program of
courses in area studies and language training.  They award graduate
fellowships, some of which have been held by economics students in
recent years.  The Centers' research projects sometimes provide research
assistantships for graduate students.  In addition, the Centers maintain
reading rooms with current publications on the area and sponsor many
lectures and seminars by leading scholars from various countries.  For
further details, contact Professor Li (313-763-9561).

<H3>Committee for Comparative and Historical Research in the Market
Economies </H3> 

The Committee for Comparative and Historical Research on
the Market Economies (CCHROME) is a unit within the Department of
Economics.  CCHROME serves as an institutional locus within the
University for comparative and historical economic research on Japan,
Western Europe, the United States, and other market economies.  Graduate
student participation in the research and training activities of CCHROME
is encouraged through seminars and research assistantships.  For
students with research interests related to CCHROME activities, some
fellowship support is available.  In addition, special multi-year
fellowships are available from the Committee on Japanese Economic
Studies for which CCHROME maintains the national headquarters.  For
further information, contact Professors Adams, Saxonhouse, or Whatley
(313-764-5567).


<A HREF="http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/">
<H3>Survey Research Center</H3>
</A>

The Survey Research Center of the 
<A HREF="http://www.isr.umich.edu/">
Institute for Social Research</A> engages
in extensive economic research, especially in the field of consumer
behavior.  A number of advanced graduate students in the Department of
Economics participate in the research program of the Center on a
part-time basis.  Through this work many students receive first-hand
experience and training in the increasingly important application of
survey research methods to economic problems.  There are also full-time
positions as Assistant in Research for those who need to take time out
from classes to accumulate funds while learning research methods.  The
Center's archives of survey data can provide a useful source of
materials for doctoral dissertations.  For further information, contact
the Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research
(313-763-5186).


<A HREF="http://psc.lsa.umich.edu/">
<H3>Population Studies</H3>
</A>

The Populations Studies Center is an interdisciplinary center that
conducts research and training activities in demography, with an
emphasis on the interrelations between population studies and other
social sciences.  An economic demography graduate training program has
been run jointly by the Population Studies Center and the Economics
Department since the 1960s, providing fellowship support to economics
Ph.D. students interested in the connection between economics and
demography.  The program supports 6-8 economics Ph.D. students per year.
 Students may combine economic demography with any other fields in
economics, with many students choosing labor economics, public finance,
or economic development.  Students in the program are given office space
at the Populations Studies Center and have access to the computing and
other research support facilities at the Center.  Economics faculty with
appointments at the Center are John Bound and David Lam.  Students who
wish to obtain further information should contact Professor David Lam,
coordinator of the Training Program in Economic Demography
(313-998-7275)


<A HREF="http://www.spp.umich.edu/">
<H3>School of Public Policy</H3>
</A>

Programs of study leading to a master's or doctoral degree in Public
Policy are offered by the School of Public Policy.  For the master's
degree, the student normally completes the required course work in two
academic years and satisfies a practicum requirement during the
intervening summer.  In addition to economics, required courses in the
program deal with political science, organization theory and
quantitative methods.  Several of these courses are open to interested
economics students.  Interested students should contact the School of
Public Policy, 440 Lorch Hall (313-764-3490).


<A HREF="http://www.bus.umich.edu/resource/otp/tax.html">
<H3>The Office of Tax Policy Research</H3>
</A>

The Office of Tax Policy Research is housed in the School of Business
Administration and is directed by Professor Slemrod, who has a joint
appointment in Economics and the Business School.  Faculty associates of
the Office come from the Economics Department, the Business School, and
the Law School.  It sponsors several tax-related activities, including a
tax policy lecture series, conferences on issues of current interest,
joint research projects, research seminars, a tax database and a
dissertation fellowship. Several graduate students hold research
assistantships with the Office each year.  For further information,
contact Professor Slemrod (313-936-3914).

<H3>Joint Program in Law and Economics</H3>

A small number of exceptionally well-qualified applicants are admitted
jointly to the Graduate School and the Law School and permitted to
pursue a program leading to both the Ph.D. degree in economics and the
J.D. degree.  The program can be completed in five calendar years but
most students take longer.  The program requires simultaneous
application to both the Law School and the Economics Department.  To be
eligible for consideration for this program, the applications must be
submitted no later than January 15.  Interested students should write to
the Admissions Office, University of Michigan Law School, for further
details (313-764-0537). Financial aid is available on an equal basis
with continuing Ph.D. economics students.  Other aid is occasionally
available from the Law School.

<H3>Joint Program in Social Work and Economics</H3>

A program of study leading to the doctoral degree in Social Work and
Economics is available.  Course requirements will be planned for each
student to include economic theory, statistics, and public finance or
labor economics. The student must pass preliminary examinations in
economic theory and in public finance or labor.  For other requirements
and additional information, students may write to the Supervising
Committee for the Doctoral Program in Social Work and Social Science,
<A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~socwk/ssw.html">

<H3>Graduate Economics Society</H3>

The Economics Society plays two roles in the graduate program. First, it
serves as the vehicle for student participation in the decision-making
processes relating to the graduate program itself. Second, it sponsors
various activities designed to broaden the outlook and perspective of
students as prospective economists.  The Society also helps new students
acquaint themselves with the Department and with life in Ann Arbor.

<P>The Society is an informal organization and all graduate students are
automatically members.  In recent years, student representatives have
played a significant role in the development and reorganization of the
graduate program.  The faculty has shown its interest in securing the
opinions of students and the Society has contributed to student-faculty
communications.

<P>The President of the Society and a second elected representative
attend departmental meetings and the President attends meetings of the
Departmental Executive Committee.  Other student representatives are
members of the Departmental Graduate Program Committee, the Admissions
and Fellowships Committee, and the Committee on Speakers.

<P>The Economics Society sponsors an orientation program for new
students and assists them in familiarizing themselves with Ann Arbor,
the University, and the Department.  Other social affairs are sponsored
by the Society during the year.


<H3>Conference on the Economic Outlook</H3>

The Department of Economics and the Institute for Social Research
jointly sponsor the annual Conference on the Economic Outlook.  This
Conference takes place each November and is attended by a large number
of business, academic, and government economists.  The program consists
of formal lectures and round-table discussions dealing both with the
short-term economic outlook for the coming year and the economic and
social setting over the longer run.  A continuing feature of this
Conference is a forecast for the U.S. economy in the year to come, made
on the basis of the econometric model developed by the Research Seminar
in Quantitative Economics.
