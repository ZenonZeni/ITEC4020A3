<B>As summer draws to a muggy close, Labor Day will soon be here. Every year
on this holiday, families from all across the country come together to celebrate
the working men and women who continually make us proud to be a part of this
great nation. We at the Made in the USA Foundation salute these Americans,
who take pride in their work and in the goods that they produce.</B>

an American Dream, which says that with perserverance, anything is possible.
Yet, all the products listed below share one thing in common: they are made
by the hands of dedicated American men and women. </B>

  <A NAME=slinky>Slinky</A>
</H2>
<P>
<P>
<B>Richard James was a marine engineer aboard ship in 1943 when a coiled,
circular torsion spring fell off a table and began rolling around the deck.
Its wild gyrations amused him, and he thought it would make a great toy.
James started tinkering with various metals, thicknesses and proportions
of metals, and two years later he perfected a coiled, steel spring that could
spiral from one step to another and "walk" down stairs. His wife Betty went
to a dictionary and found the word "Slinky." The Jameses persuaded the Gimbles
store in Philadelphia to allow them to set up a sloped board in the toy
department where "Slinky" could walk. Within 90 minutes, all 400 in stock
were sold.</B>
<P>
<B> In 1945, they set up James Industries in Hollidaysburg, PA, which continues
to manufacture Slinky products under the watchful eye of Betty James. In
the 1990's, the Slinky line includes a Slinky Junior, two-color plastic Slinkys,
Slinky eyeballs and neon Slinkys. The company also manufactures Playshapes
construction toys and Dabblin Dough molding compound, but the original Slinky
still outsells all other toys.</B>

<P>
<P>
<B>Founded in 1941 as a family-run workshop in a Manhattan loft employing
six leather artisans, Coach continues to make its home in New York City,
though its workforce has expanded to 5000 since its humble beginnings. Coach's
founders were inspired by the leather used to create the classic American
baseball glove. They learned that handling of this leather over time resulted
in a unique suppleness. Through an innovative tanning process, Coach refined
glove-tanned leather, making it softer, stronger and colorfast. Each Coach
product is made one item at a time by skilled leather workers, many of whom
have worked for the company for over 20 years and are valued for their talent
and expertise. With precision and accuracy, they carefully create exquisite
leathergoods using up to 85 steps to complete one product. </B>

</H2>
<P>
<P>
<B>Led by the fifth generation of family ownership and management, The
Pfaltzgraff Co. is America's leading manufacturer and marketer of casual
dinnerware and accessories for the home. As the oldest pottery maker in the
United States, The Pfaltzgraff Co. has grown from a modest-sized shop producing
salt-glazed stoneware in the early 1800s, to a large manufacturer offering
more than 60 patterns. Today the company employs 2,500 and occupies nearly
2 million square feet of manufacturing and distributing facilities. </B>
<P>
<B>The Pfaltzgraff family, German immigrant potters, began the business in
1811 in York, Pennsylvania, which is still company headquarters. Early
decorations of Pfaltzgraff pottery took the form of German or English sayings,
figures, flowers, animals and patriotic themes. Today, Pfaltzgraff offers
a continuously expanding and evolving line of dinnerware and table accessories
that reflect current home design and lifestyle trends. Several of Pfaltzgraff's
patterns regularly appear on the nation's "Top 10" bridal registry list of
casual dinnerware patterns. The company also markets high-quality stainless
steel flatware, beverageware, and a full line of glass gift and serveware.
Currently, Pfaltzgraff is successfully introducing its brand to countries
beyond the U.S., with the goal of becoming a world-wide tabletop supplier.</B>

</H2>
<P>
<P>
<B>Based in Redmond, Washington, O'Brien is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Meridian Sports, Inc. and is the world's largest manufacturer of wakeboards,
kneeboards, waterskis and related accessories. Also the world's oldest leading
waterski company, O'Brien has a strong legacy of design and performance
innovations. Indeed, in 1995 O'Brien claims to have begun "a new era in the
waterski industry" with the revolutionary design of its G-Series slalom skis.
For 1996, O'Brien has created an Anti Drift Mini Fin(tm) for its G3 Revenge,
which will allow the skier to hold even sharper angles through the wake.
In addition, O'Brien is introducing designs for wakeboards like the Double
Ender, Full Nelson and Uro Flex High Wrap which will allow for more edge
and body control. O'Brien has also designed the Rumor Pro, Rumor Comp and
BFS for advanced slalom skiers over 175 pounds, and the new G1 Intruder for
competitive junior skiers under 120 pounds.</B>
<P>
<B> O'Brien sponsors the Pro Water Ski Tour, the U.S. Open, and the U.S.
Nationals, and the company's strong sports legacy continues as it presented
its one-millionth ski (a G3 Revenge) to the American Waterski Educational
Foundation, as a donation to its Waterski Hall of Fame. The company manufactures
all its products in Kent, Washington.</B>

  <A NAME=ps>Proctor-Silex</A>
</H2>
<P>
<P>
<B>In 1912, a 14-year-old boy in Jackson, Michigan named Joe Myers convinced
his mother to buy her first electric iron for $2.98. Soon the boy was tinkering
with the single-setting iron, adding an adjustable temperature control. But
Myers did not have any luck marketing the new thermostatic electric iron
until the Proctor and Scwartz Company saw the invention and decided that
it would be a perfect match for the automatic toaster they had just developed.
In 1929, the first "Proctor" iron and toaster were released, inaugurating
a long line of home appliances that offered consumers value and convenience.
Today Proctor-Silex makes millions of irons and toasters annually, along
with automatic drip coffee makers, can openers, popcorn pumpers and toaster
ovens/broilers. In 1990, the company merged with Hamilton Beach.</B>
<P>
<B> While Proctor-Silex's irons, coffee makers and and can openers are now
made in Mexico or China, the company continues to produce all of its toasters,
toaster ovens, and Crock Watcher Slow Cookers in the U.S. Proctor-Silex has
plants in Mt. Airy, Washington and Southern Pines, North Carolina. </B>
