<b>MIE1107H - Statistical Thermodynamics</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/ward.html"> C.A. Ward </a>
<br>
Thermodynamics is reviewed. Quantum mechanics is 
introduced and used to define the possible microscopic states 
of macroscopic systems. For macroscopic systems in 
thermodynamic equilibrium, the concept of ensemble 
averages is introduced and the postulates of statistical 
mechanics are used to calculate their thermodynamic 
properties from knowledge of their molecular nature. Entropy 
is interpreted in terms of quantum mechanical concepts. The 
thermal properties of solids, of gases adsorbed on solid 
surfaces, of electrons in solids, of radiation, and of ideal gases 
are studied.<p>

<b>MIE1110H - Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/ward.html"> C.A. Ward </a>
<br>
Statistical thermodynamics is reviewed. The concept of 
quantum mechanical transition probabilities is applied to 
develop a theory of kinetics, called Statistical Rate Theory. One 
postulate is added to those of statistical mechanics in order to 
formulate the theory. The objective of Statistical Rate Theory is 
to predict the rate of processes in terms of the equilibrium or 
material properties of the system. The theory is applied to 
predict the rate of simple chemical reactions, the rate of gas 
adsorption on well defined solid surfaces, and the rate of 
liquid evaporation. <p>
