Mr. Jerry Berman
Interactive Working Group
Center for Democracy and Technology
1001 G St., NW
Suite 700 East
Washington, DC 2000

Dear Mr. Berman:

Interactive communications media are growing at an astonishing rate, 
promising great advances for domestic commerce, international 
competitiveness, and political and cultural life. Nearly ten years
ago, we began work on the Electronic Communications Priva cy Act 
("ECPA"), in recognition of the fact that new computer and communications 
technologies would only flourish in an environment where the privacy 
rights of users, the intellectual property rights of content providers, and the 
obligations of service pr oviders are clear under statute. We continued that 
work last year in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
("CALEA"). Today, as interactive
communications systems expand in the consumer market, there is a critical 
need to clarify the First Amendment rights and responsibilities of 
information providers, users and carriers. 

As you know, a number of bills have been introduced in the Senate that 
would regulate a wide range of controversial content on interactive 
information services, including the Internet. This legislation is motivated by 
two important goals. First, parents s hould be able to control their children's 
access to controversial material. Second, adult users should be able to exercise 
reasonable control over the information they receive so they may avoid 
material offense to them.

The proposed legislative solutions to achieve these goals raise serious 
concerns about the free flow of information in new communications media, 
and threaten to squelch the development of the Internet and a vital new 
industry along with it. 

I understand that industry and public interest organizations have 
independently come together to form the Interactive Working Group in 
order to address these issues. My hope is that the group will explore public 
policy and technology options for addressin g the problems of children's 
access to obscene content in a manner which promotes parental 
empowerment and First Amendment values. I would appreciate the 
Interactive Working group Consideration of and recommendation on
the following issues: 

1. THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE: 

What effect will content regulation have on the development of the national 
and global information infrastructure, including the Internet and other 
interactive services? 

2. CURRENT LAW AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: 

What is the current lawregulating obscenity and harassment online? What 
gaps, if any, are there in current federal and state laws which hamper 
prosecution of criminal activity, including violations of
the copyright and obscenity laws, in interactive media ? 

3. TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS: 

Does interactive technology enable parents to control their children's access to 
information in online services today? If not, what steps would be required to 
enable such parental control? Can the Working Group provide 
demonstrations of these user control technologies? 

4. CONSTITUTIONAL FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY ISSUES: 

What are the First Amendment implications of content regulation in 
interactive media? What is the impact of carrier liability for content on ECPA, CALEA and constitutional privacy protections? 

Since the passage of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and again in 
CALEA, we have always worked to assure a proper balance of constitutional 
liberties, competitiveness and legitimate government interest in the 
regulation of new communications te chnologies. As I receive input from a 
number of sources on these important issues, I look forward to your advice as 
well. My staff is available to meet with members of your group to discuss 
these issues further. 

Sincerely, 

[sig] 

Patrick J. Leahy United States Senator
