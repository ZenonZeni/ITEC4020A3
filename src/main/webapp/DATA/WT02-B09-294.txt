<P>
It is becoming increasingly clear that we're going to miss yet another ship date for our new product. This is unacceptable. I don't need to remind any of you that our last two products,  SumWare and FlatWare, weren't exactly category killers. 
<P>
This time, we've got the right product at the right time. If we ship our new Internet security application No!Ware soon, we can leverage our positioning and maximize the potential upside to seize the strategic high ground and establish dominance in this critical space in the marketplace.
<P>
If not . . . well let's just say that some of you are going to be looking for jobs before I go crawling back to my in-laws for yet another infusion of capital. 

<P>
It's time we rededicated ourselves to the value of a good 18-hour work day. If we're going to meet this deadline, we're going to have to maximize the work ethic around here. I'd like everyone to spend a little less time cheering on the company Ultimate Frisbee team and a little more time making the Ultimate Sacrifice; a little less hacky-sacking in the hallways and a little more hacking at the computer terminals. Got it?

<P>
To kick things off, I'm scheduling a company-wide meeting for next Wednesday. I want this to be part rally, part harangue. Time to put a little fear back in the workplace. Like I always say, "Meaningful Threats + Empty Promises = Improved Productivity."
<P>
Here's my outline for the meeting. <P>
<OL>
<LI>Opening Remarks--Candy: Digital Convergence Means War. Introduce me.
<LI>Cue Music : "Nowhere Man" (Roscoe: Find some third-rate rock group to record the first few lines with the last word changed: "He's a real No!Ware man. Sitting in his No!Ware land. Making all his No!Ware plans. For EVERYONE.")
<LI>I take the stage dressed in commando black. Either A) I get lowered from the rafters with a knife between my teeth, or B) I come out with three Dobermans straining at the leash. Flash pots might be good, too.
<LI>Life-sized dummy of the chairman of our arch rival MindWarp tossed on stage. Dogs rip it to shreds. (Smear it with hamburger first?)
<LI>I give speech. (Roscoe: Find me a copy of the movie <I> Patton.</I>)
<LI>Candy tears off blazer and blouse to reveal "We're going No!Ware. Fast!" T-shirt.
<LI>Roscoe, Victor toss No!Ware Fast T-shirts to crowd.
<LI>Closing chant: "Where are we going?" "No!Ware" "When are we going?" "Now!"
