<h1 align=center>Governor Weld Signs
<br>Medicinal Marijuana Law</h1>

<p>A new medicinal marijuana bill was signed into law by Massachusetts
Governor William Weld on August 8. The bill, H.&nbsp;2170, was carefully
tailored by the legislature to address Governor Weld's objections to a
similar bill passed in late 1995, which Weld had refused to sign into law.</p>

<p>Massachusetts activists diligently lobbied for a bill that would allow
patients arrested on marijuana charges to use the affirmative defense of
&quot;medical necessity&quot; in court. Several state supreme courts have
recognized this defense, accepting that it is permitted under common law.
Others, including Massachusetts, refuse to allow this defense. In 1991,
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the societal harm of
allowing the necessity defense would be greater than the harm done to a
patient denied the opportunity to offer the defense.</p>

<p>The 1995 bill would have rectified the matter by establishing the defense
through legislation. However, the governor sent the bill back to the legislature,
arguing that it was too broad and likely to be abused.</p>

<p>The new law, therefore, is much more limited. It expands upon a law
signed by Governor Weld in 1991 which provided for the creation of a medicinal
marijuana therapeutic research program. Such programs operated in several
states in the late 1970s and early 1980s, providing marijuana to patients
who met certain medical criteria. Though officially &quot;research&quot;
programs, data were seldom analyzed and published: The programs served
mainly as a compassionate way for a few state governments to circumvent
the federal government's prohibition of medicinal marijuana.</p>

<p>The new Massachusetts law would allow patients to use the necessity
defense, but only if they are &quot;certified to participate&quot; in the
therapeutic research program and possessed the marijuana &quot;for personal
use pursuant to such program.&quot;</p>

<p>This hardly establishes a meaningful necessity defense: First, it is
unimaginable that a patient receiving marijuana as part of this program
would ever be arrested -- much less prosecuted and convicted -- for marijuana
possession, even without a codified medical necessity defense. Second,
the state public health department failed to launch a program during the
five years since the research program law took effect! Presently, there
is no such program running in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in addition to the message it sends that marijuana is
a useful medicine for some people, the new law will be beneficial for two
reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li>It raises the possibility that the courts may accept a defense of medical
necessity for a broader pool of patients -- for example, patients who meet
the criteria for the program but are not yet enrolled because the program
has not started running or because they did not know about it. 
<br>
<br></li>

<li>It contains a provision mandating that, within 180 days, the state's
public health department should establish the rules and regulations necessary
to get the program running. Within a year, hundreds of people suffering
from cancer, glaucoma, or asthma (but not AIDS or other unspecified ailments)
may be legally using marijuana in Massachusetts.</li>
</ol>

<p>The department must also explore the various ways of obtaining a supply
of marijuana to provide the patients.</p>

<p>There are four potential legal sources of marijuana for a state to use
for research purposes: importing it (from the Netherlands), receiving it
from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, getting permission from the
federal government to grow its own, or using confiscated marijuana.</p>

<p>Each of these options carries its own difficulties. During the next
few months, the Marijuana Project Project will be advising Massachusetts
officials on how best to obtain a legal source of marijuana so that its
research program can start providing marijuana to patients in need.</p>
