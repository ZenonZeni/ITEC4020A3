<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 232</TITLE>

<H1>The economics of internationally-agreed 
climate change policies</H1>
<HR>
<B>From a narrow economic perspective, individual countries do not have a strong incentive 
to reduce their net greenhouse gas emissions unilaterally. </B>Few countries emit more than 
1-2% of mankind's current fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). So if a country reduced its 
emissions, it would receive <I>some</I> benefit in the form of a small reduction in global climate 
change, but that benefit would be only a tiny fraction of the world-wide benefit. As a result, individual 
countries have very little economic incentive for incurring the costs of abating emissions or of 
enhancing forests or other "carbon sinks".<P>
<B>To be truly effective, climate policies will have to be international. </B>The OECD 
countries account for about one-half of mankind’s current CO2 emissions. However, even if all the 
OECD countries work together to cut their emissions, they would have only a limited impact on 
future climate change because emissions are expected to increase rapidly in the developing countries. 
It must be remembered that, while the industrialized countries are largely responsible for the historical 
build-up of atmospheric concentrations, <I>new policies can only impact current and future 
emissions</I>.<P>
<B>Resource transfers will be required to make an internationally coordinated policy 
attractive to developing countries. </B>Developing countries may be relatively more vulnerable to 
climate change than are industrialized countries. However, the <I>total</I> benefit they would 
receive from policies to reduce climate change damages is likely to be smaller than the benefit realized 
by industrial countries, since the latter have larger economies (this analysis considers only market 
goods and services - see fact sheet 229). Resources will therefore have to be transferred to 
developing countries to make it attractive for them to incur the costs of substantially reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks. Precedents for such transfers exist. For 
example, under the amended Montreal Protocol industrialized countries compensate developing 
countries for the "incremental costs" of substituting new chemicals for CFCs. In the case of climate 
change, rich countries would find transfers economically attractive because the total cost of 
abatement can be reduced if the abatement burden is distributed widely. While the UN Convention on 
Climate Change calls for such transfers, agreeing on their magnitude and distribution will not be 
easy.<P>
<B>Free rider incentives will be hard to overcome. </B>The problem is that any country that 
decides not to participate in the global effort to reduce emissions saves substantially on abatement 
costs. At the same time, because this country’s emissions are small relative to the total, it would 
suffer only a minute loss in benefit as a consequence of its own decision not to participate. So this 
country would be better off economically  if it did not participate.<P>
<B>It will be harder to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide than it has been to reduce emissions 
of gases that destroy the ozone layer. </B>While it is true that the Montreal Protocol successfully 
harnessed international cooperation to phase out CFCs, climate change is a very different 
environmental problem. Reducing CFCs will be relatively cheap, and the economically-measurable 
benefits quite high - largely because ozone depletion causes cancer, which people are willing to pay 
a lot to avoid. This gave countries strong unilateral incentives to agree to phasing out CFCs. Such is 
not the case with climate change.<P>
<B>To be cost-effective, international climate change policies should include more than just 
emissions targets. </B>Many other actions can be taken to reduce atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gases at a low cost. The destruction of rain forests, for example, has been hastened by 
domestic tax policies that provide incentives for excessive deforestation; removing these policies 
would not only reduce climate change, but would benefit national economic development. Eliminating 
subsidies on fossil fuels would also reduce CO2 emissions while improving economic performance. A 
different type of problem relates to large-scale leaks of methane from the former USSR’s natural gas 
pipelines. These leaks occur largely because the Soviet incentive system did not reward efficiency. 
Economic reforms in Eastern Europe and the former USSR are almost certain to lead to more 
efficient energy use and thus fewer emissions per unit of GNP. International cooperation on these 
various issues would help to speed the adjustment to more efficient economies.<P>
<B>An international programme based solely on economic self-interest would not have to 
include measures for adapting to climate change.</B> If the Netherlands builds dikes to protect 
Amsterdam, it incurs the cost but also receives all of the benefit. This gives the Netherlands an 
economic incentive to adapt to climate change to the extent necessary. The same would hold true for 
all other countries. Consequently, apart from transferring funds to poor countries and cooperating on 
research and development, an international agreement on adaptation is not really needed.<P>
