Strategic Marketing Planning</CENTER>
</H4>
The practice of environmental marketing by many national brand companies
from 1990 to the present has been unsuccessful. In fact, most &quot;green&quot;
products and services designed and promoted primarily for their environmental
benefits have failed. The reason for their failure is embarrassingly simple:
they did not first satisfy the basic style, performance and/or price requirements
or expectations of the mass market. <BR>
<BR>
Coddington Environmental helps businesses appropriately position product,
service and technology &quot;design-for-the-environment&quot; initiatives.
After all, the greenest products and technologies won't benefit the environment
if they don't see the light of day.
