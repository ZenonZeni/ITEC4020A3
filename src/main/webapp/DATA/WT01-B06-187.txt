<TITLE>NFL Owners</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff" TEXT="#000000"><P><B>We encourage you to print out or cut and paste the letter below, and mail or e-mail it to your football team's owner, telling him or her that you believe NFL products should be manufactured in America by Americans.</B>

<P><B><A NAME=state>There's nothing </A>better than cool autumn Sundays spent watching professional football at the stadium or in the comfort of your own living room. Everyone has their favorite team. Maybe you grew up outside of Philadelphia and are a diehard Eagles fan. Or maybe you had a favorite player like Unitas, or Starr, or Bradshaw who seemed to carry their entire team on their back, and so their team became your team. </B>

<P><B>And maybe you have that old jersey your father gave you, the jersey that made you proud to be associated with that player or team, and with football in general. But one thing has changed. </B>

<P><B>Now when you go to give your son or daughter a t-shirt or hat bearing their favorite team's logo&nbsp;look at the label. Where you might expect to find the words "Made in the USA," you now see "Made in China" or "Made in Bangladesh." Professional football has become this country's most popular sport, and its atheletes make more money than many Americans could hope to spend in a lifetime. Players and owners like Deion Sanders and Art Modell tell us that football has become a business, and what matters is the bottom line.</B>

<P><B>We at the Made in the USA Foundation believe in a different conception of football. We still see it as a "sport" which brings families and friends together, encouraging friendly rivalries and spirited good times. &nbsp;Many of football's most loyal fans, however, are hard-working individuals our country's manufacturing sector. Yet as more and more manufacturing is shipped overseas, these men and women rightfully fear losing their jobs. So we at the Made in the USA Foundation call on the NFL's owners to re-evaluate their priorities, and bring the production of their goods back to the United States. Please copy or print out the letter below and send it to your team's owner. The fans can make a difference.</B>

<P><B><A NAME=letter>Dear</A></B>

<P><B>Football is truly an all-American sport.  As you know, Wilson still makes the official NFL football in Ada, Ohio in the heartland of the country.  As a supporter of the Made in the USA Foundation, I would like to encourage teams and the NFL to have more souvenirs and equipment manufactured in the United States.  We want you to join us as well.</B>

<P><B>A large majority of NFL fans like myself want to buy U.S.-made products.    But by importing NFL-logo products, the National Football League and its teams are turning off the fans, the lifeblood of the sport.  These fans now are refusing to buy imported souvenirs and have become irritated by the lack of choice.   I believe that it is in the owners' long-term interests to keep fans supportive and enthusiastic.</B>

<P><B>For every player who makes it to the NFL there are literally thousands who don't make the grade. Unfortunately, many of these athletes are unemployed or are employed in low-wage jobs.   In this tough job market we need to keep Americans working at productive jobs.  The backbone of our economy has always been manufacturing.  Making NFL-logo products in the USA will not by itself turn the economy around, but it is an important symbolic step to creating jobs in the United States.</B>

<P><B>Please help us convince the league that NFL licensed and authorized products should be required to be made in the USA.</B>
