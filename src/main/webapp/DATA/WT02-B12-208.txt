Access</FONT></U></TT></A><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">.</FONT></U><TT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Agricultural Labor

Relations Board on September 22, 1996 issued two decisions on

the access of union organizers to workers on farms.  In Gargiulo,

22 ALRB 9, the employer asserted that five UFW organizers violated

the time and number rules that regulate access, disrupted harvesting

activities, and damaged crops, and asked that the ALRB ban the

UFW from taking access for 60 days.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB ordered hearings to be

held on the employer declarations, made under penalty of perjury,

that allege the union significantly disrupted agricultural operations,

intentionally harassed employers or employees, or intentionally

disregarded the access rules.  In the meantime, UFW organizers

retain the right to take access to Gargiulo workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In Navarro Farms, 22 ALRB 10,

the employer declared that UFW organizers took access to its Casserly

Ranch July 25, 1996 but, instead of talking to workers, they inspected

toilet and drinking water facilities and, Navarro declared, told

employees that they were from Cal-OSHA.  The ALRB ordered a hearing

on whether the UFW organizers, acting on instructions from the

UFW office in Watsonville, used access to conduct a safety inspection

rather than to communicate with employees.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Agricultural Labor Relations

Act, enacted in 1975, does not deal with the access of non-employee

union organizers to workers employed on farms.  Under the NLRA,

the NLRB decides on a case-by-case basis whether union organizers

should have access to the work site where employees are working.

 This means that, in the nonfarm private sector, unions petition

the NLRB for access to employees on a ship, or an isolated resort

hotel or a logging camp.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB reviewed the California

farm labor market and concluded that unions routinely asked for

access to farm workers, and the ALRB would normally grant them

access.  The ALRB justified presumptive access on the grounds

that many farm workers live and work on employer property; that

workers who enter and leave a farm come and go at different points,

so that there is no single public place for organizers to wait

to talk to them; and that worker characteristics, including little

education and lack of English, limit the ability of organizers

to effectively communicate with workers through printed literature,

radio, or other media.  After much litigation, the ALRB access

rule was upheld by the California and U.S. Supreme Courts (Superior

Farms-Pandol v. ALRB, 429 U.S. 802, 1976).</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB access<U> </U>rules limit

non-employee union organizers by number and time.  After the union

files with the ALRB a Notice of Intent to Take Access (NA), up

to two organizers can come and go on the farm for the first 30&nbsp;workers,

and then one organizer for each additional 15 workers.  Union

organizers enter a farm for a maximum three hours per day--one

hour before work, during lunch, and after work, for up to four

30-day periods per year.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc369261903"><TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">ALRB:

Strikers and Jobs.</FONT></U></TT></A><TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">

 On July 30, 1996, the ALRB issued Dole Farming Company, 22 ALRB

8 (1996), upholding an Administrative Law Judge decision that

Dole had unlawfully fired and refused to rehire 18 members of

a spraying crew who protested a new work schedule.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Dole Farming Company is the Bakersfield-based

grape, tree fruit, and citrus part of Dole Food Company.  On May

10, 1994, foreman Martinez told two spray crews that half of each

crew would work the following day, and the other on May 12, and

that the full crews would return to work through the weekend.

 This changed established practices, in which Dole's spray crews

often worked 14 to 16 hours per day for seven days each week from

May through July.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Farm workers in California are

entitled to 1.5 times their usual pay for hours in excess of 10

per day and 60 per week, and two times their pay for hours in

excess of eight hours per day on the seventh consecutive day of

work.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The spraying crew protested that,

if they were not going to get the seventh day overtime, because

of the day off, they wanted the day off to be Sunday, not in the

middle of the week.  The crew demanded a meeting with ranch manager

Lopez, and he told them that they would have to abide by the work

schedule that the company made or leave.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The workers decided that either

all or none would return to work, but that, before accepting the

new schedule, they would demand an increase in pay for clean-up

work and work equipment.  However, before they got a chance to

discuss these issues with Lopez, the 10 names of workers who were

supposed to work May 10, 1994 were read out and all refused to

work.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Lopez testified that he heard

a worker ask for checks, and that they should go home, and return

for their checks in several hours.  Lopez returned with the checks

several hours later.<B>  </B></FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Two days later, on May 12, 1994,

one worker returned and requested his old job, and he returned

again on May 13.  On each occasion he was told not yet, and Dole

never contacted him about his job.  Dole does not have a seniority

list, and never contacted any ex-members of the spray crew about

their jobs.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALJ decided, and the ALRB

affirmed, that Dole committed an 1153(a) Unfair Labor Practice

by firing and refusing to rehire the spray crew members who had

engaged in protected concerted activity, i.e., refusing to work

under the new work schedule.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Under the ALRA, employees who

engage in protected concerted activities can be disciplined, but

not fired.  In many non-union settings, workers engage in spontaneous

strikes, meaning that they refuse to work in order to, e.g.  protest

a new work schedule.  Such striking workers can be replaced, but

they cannot be fired for protesting.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Replacement means that the employer

announces jobs are vacant and they are open to be filled by temporary

or permanent replacement workers.  If the strikers return to work,

they must be rehired without prejudice for engaging in a protest

over wages and working conditions.  Firing means that the employer

leaves a job vacant rather than rehiring a returning striker.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In S&amp;S Ranch, 22 ALRB 7 (1996),

the ALRB on July 18, 1996 overturned an ALJ decision that 27 employees

who refused to work after S&amp;S did not grant them a $0.25 raise

were economic strikers that the employer improperly failed to

rehire when they offered to return to work at the old wage.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">S&amp;S Ranch is a Mendota-based

cotton ranch, and on July 20, 1994, 27 members of foreman Soto's

irrigation crew asked for a $0.25 raise, which Soto refused, as

did the ranch manager.  The workers went to the EDD office in

Mendota, which told them it could not help them, but that S&amp;S

had called to ask for replacement workers.  Soto later visited

the EDD office, but was unable to obtain replacement workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The irrigation workers returned

to S&amp;S, where personnel manager Blanco said that there were

a few vacancies left, and that they should apply to Soto for jobs.

 After gathering more workers, they spoke with the ranch manager,

with Blanco acting as interpreter, who also rejected their request

for a $0.25 raise.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The workers returned to EDD, and

then to the ranch.  According to the workers, Blanco told them

to go and talk to foreman Soto, who was responsible for hiring

his own crew.  Soto told at least one worker that it was too late

to go to work on July 20, but to return the next day.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A few workers returned to work

on July 21, and most were back to work on July 22.  The ALJ decided

that the complaining workers were not rehired on July 20, when

they offered to return to work, and thus were owed make-whole

wages for the missed days of work.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The ALRB overturned the ALJ's

decision, reasoning that the workers were economic strikers, 

and that Blanco's July 20 mid-day instruction to go and talk to

Soto about getting their jobs back was &quot;an adequate offer

of reinstatement.&quot;</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Economic strikers lose wages and

potentially their jobs, since the employer can permanently replace

economic strikers.  Unfair labor practice strikers, by contrast,

are entitled to back pay and their old jobs.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The S&amp;S workers initially

claimed that they were unlawfully fired for engaging in protected

concerted activities, i.e., asking for a $0.25 raise.  The ALJ

concluded that they were economic strikers, and that they were

owed back wages for the day or two after they offered to return

to work and before they were reinstated.  The ALRB overturned

the ALJ's decision, and said that S&amp;S offered to rehire the

strikers on the day that they protested and then returned to work.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Peak Employment</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">.

 In July 1994, 107 farm workers at the Gallo winery in Sonoma

county voted 4 to 1 to have the UFW represent them, and the ALRB

certified the UFW as bargaining representative for Gallo's Sonoma

farm workers.  In April 1996, a state superior court ruled that

the election was not valid because Gallo expanded its operations,

and thus employment was not 50 percent of the peak 250 that Gallo

estimated would be employed in 1994, as the ALRA requires.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">However, in 1994, Gallo hired

a peak 175 workers, so that the winery was at peak employment

in July when the election was held.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On August 27, 1996, the 5th District

Court of Appeal in Fresno reinstated the UFW election victory

at the Gallo winery, ruling that California judges can set aside

elections only when the ALRB makes a clear legal error, which

it did not do in this case.  The Appeals Court rejected the first

judge's ruling that the ALRB is required to base peak employment

levels on statewide estimates of acreage and labor needs.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc369261905"><TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">US-Illegal

Aliens.</FONT></U></TT></A><TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">  By

a voice vote, the House of Representatives on July 11-12, 1996

approved a rider to the $145 million appropriation for the NLRB

that bars the NLRB from expending funds &quot;on behalf of an

employee not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the

United States.&quot;  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Those who supported the rider

argued that the NLRB should not be able to order US employers

to provide back pay to aliens who should not be in the US.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">NLRB Chairman William B. Gould

opposed the rider, and members of Congress who argued against

it noted that it may give US employers an incentive to hire unauthorized

alien workers, since they would not be entitled to back pay if

the employer unlawfully acts against them.  Several members of

Congress argued that, if the unauthorized worker cannot receive

back pay, at least the employer should be required to pay the

US Treasury the funds that cannot be received by the unauthorized

worker.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">If this provision survives the

conference committee, the NLRB could not order employers to provide

back pay for unauthorized workers for any period in which they

were not lawfully in the United States.  The US Supreme Court,

in a 1984 decision, Sure-Tan v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883 (1984), held

that the NLRB acted reasonably in interpreting the word &quot;employee&quot;

in the National Labor Relations Act to include unauthorized aliens

(116 LRRM 2857).  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Court in Sure-Tan held that

the exclusion of undocumented alien employees from participation

in union activities and the protection against employer intimidation

would create a kind of subclass of workers which would erode the

unity of all employees and impede effective collective bargaining.

 However, in the Sure-Tan case, the unauthorized workers left

the US.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The NLRB in December 1995 reaffirmed

the right of two unauthorized workers to receive back pay in APRA

Fuel Oil Buyers Group Inc, 320 NLRB No. 53 (December 21, 1995).

 In this case, APRA fired six union supporters, two of whom were

unauthorized aliens.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The NLRB majority decision concluded

that &quot;the most effective way for the Board to accommodate--and

indeed to further--the immigration policies IRCA embodies is,

to the extent possible, to provide the protections and remedies

of the NLRA to undocumented workers in the same manner as to other

employees...[to avoid giving] incentives for some unscrupulous

employers to play the provisions of the NLRA and IRCA against

each other to defeat the fundamental objectives of each, while

profiting from their own wrongdoing with relative impunity.&quot;</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The NLRB in APRA held that unauthorized

workers were entitled to backpay and reinstatement if they could

produce, within a reasonable time, documents enabling the employer

to meet its obligation under IRCA [the Immigration Reform and

Control Act of 1986] to verify their eligibility for employment

in the United States.&quot;  Thus, the unauthorized workers unlawfully

fired by APRA are entitled to backpay from the date of discharge

to the earlier of (1) their reinstatement, including their compliance

with IRCA, or (2) the workers' failure, after a reasonable time,

to produce documents establishing eligibility to work in the US.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US Supreme Court in February

1996 refused to review this NLRB decision.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In New York, a federal judge enforced

an arbitration award requiring the grocery chain A&amp;P to reinstate

an employee who had given a false name and other false information

on his job application to conceal the fact that he was an illegal

alien (The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Local No. 338,

Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union, DC SNY, No. 95

Civ. 5255, May 28, 1996).  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The employee was an illegal alien

when he applied for a job in 1986, became a legal resident in

1989, and a naturalized US citizen in 1994.  The union agreement

allows A&amp;P to discharge employees for dishonesty.  The arbitrator

held that nine years of employment more than offset the dishonesty

about legal status in 1986.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc369261906"><TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">US-Joint

Employment.</FONT></U></TT></A><TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">

 A federal Appeals Court in July 1996 ruled that over 600 bean

pickers in south Florida can collect as much as $2 per hour between

1986 and 1989 from a grower who used a contractor to supply workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On July 19, 1996, the US Court

of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit modified its 1994 ruling that

set out the parameters for joint employment in labor contractor-grower

situations.  In Antenor v D &amp; S Farms, 88 F.3d 925; 1996 U.S.

App, Antenor and over 600 other mostly Haitian women who picked

beans in south Florida sought back wages from both the labor contractor,

Ag-Tech Services, and D&amp;S Farms, and the court ruled that

D&amp;S was a joint employer, and thus jointly liable for the

back pay, because its supervisors were involved in managing the

workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">According to the winning attorney,

this means that growers in most circumstances will be considered

joint employers with contractors unless the contractor has true

&quot;absolute, sole, and unfettered control&quot; over the workers,

and has a substantial investment in equipment and facilities.

 Some speculate that this may be the biggest farm labor back pay

case ever.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In the mid-1980s, farmers growing

snap beans for the fresh market turned to Ag-Tech Services, a

labor contractor, to get the beans picked for $3.90 per box, minus

$0.11 per box for grower-paid workers compensation.  Growers determined

when and where to pick, then contacted Ag-Tech Services, which

sent the crew to their field.  However, picking did not begin

until the grower or his supervisor gave approval.  Pickers were

supervised by one Ag-Tech Services and one grower field boss.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Growers issued two checks to Ag-Tech

Services:  one for Social Security taxes, and one for the remainder

of the $3.90 per box fee.  Ag-Tech Services, in turn, paid its

supervisors, and the supervisors paid the pickers, in some cases

deducting for the cost of transportation to the fields.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The bean pickers sued, charging,

among other things, that D&amp;S Farms and Ag-Tech Services did

not keep accurate records of hours worked and production, and

that, in some cases, workers received as little as $2 per hour

for their work.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A federal district court ruled

that the farm workers could not sue D&amp;S Farms, because D&amp;S

Farms was not a joint employer with Ag-Tech Services.  DOL uses

five factors to determine whether there is a joint employment

relationship: the nature and degree of control of the workers,

the degree of supervision of the work, the power to determine

the pay rates or the methods of payment, the right to hire and

fire and the payment of wages.  In addition, the court held that

three other factors are relevant--does the grower own the facilities

where the work occurs, is the workers' work integral to the production

process, and what is the grower's and labor contractor's relative

investment in equipment and facilities?</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In reviewing these eight factors,

the Court found that D&amp;S Farms told Ag Tech how many pickers

to bring to the field and determined when picking was to begin,

that D&amp;S Farms supervisors talked directly to workers about

the quality of their work, and that D&amp;S Farms at one point

told Ag Tech to stop all picking until the pickers obtained identification

cards from the South Florida Vegetable Association.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">According to the court in Antenor,

MSPA was intended to hold &quot;agricultural employers' fully

accountable as joint employers whenever the facts suggest that

liability is fairly imposed,&quot; which implies that, if in doubt,

the courts will assume that there is a joint employment relationship.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc369261907"><TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">US-Bargaining.</FONT></U></TT></A><TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">

 The US Supreme Court ruled, in an 8-1 decision announced on June

20, that employers who bargain jointly with unions are shielded

from charges that they are violating antitrust laws when they

impose new wages and benefits on workers after collective bargaining

agreements expire.  About 40 percent of all US collective bargaining

agreements covering 1,000 or more workers involve so-called &quot;multiemployer

bargaining&quot; in which participating employers appoint a committee

of negotiators to bargain for them with the union.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Court found that National

Football League team owners did not violate antitrust laws when,

in 1989, the owners imposed a $1,000 per week salary cap on rookies

who played on taxi or practice squads.  The players sued the owners

under the Sherman Antitrust Act, and won a $30 million award that

was overturned by the decision.</FONT></TT>
