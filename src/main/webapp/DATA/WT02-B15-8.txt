<tt>On the basis of exit polls, the New York Times reported that 83 percent of
those voting in November 1996 were white, 10 percent were African-American,
five percent were Hispanic and one percent were Asian.  About 6.6 million
Hispanics were registered to vote in November 1996, including 2.1 million in
California and 1.6 million in Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>Exit polls after the November 5, 1996 election found that 71 percent of
Hispanic voters supported Clinton, a sharp jump from the Latino vote for
Clinton in 1992 and a sign, some analysts said, that Latinos were voting
against Republicans because of their support for anti-immigration
proposals.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans are divided over immigration; the party includes both
close-the-border and open-the-border extremes.  The open-border proponents said
"I told you so" when many Hispanic and Asian voters said that they voted for
Clinton because of some Republicans anti-immigrant rhetoric.</tt><p>
<tt>Hispanics are about 26 percent of the California population and they cast
about 1.4 million votes, accounting for 11 to 13 percent of the vote in
California in November 1996, up from 10 percent in 1992, and seven percent in
1988.  There are now 14 Latino representatives in the 80-seat California
Assembly.  The Democrats, who retook control of the Assembly, elected Cruz
Bustamante of Fresno as their first Latino speaker.</tt><p>
<tt>Latinos cast 16 percent of the November 1996 vote in Texas and 12 percent
in Florida, up from 10 and 11 percent in November 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 1, 1996, House Republicans asked the US Attorney General to
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's Citizenship USA program.  The program was launched in August 1995 to
eliminate the backlog of naturalization applicants.  </tt><p>
<tt>In their letter requesting the special counsel, the five Republican
congressmen said that "The Clinton administration, motivated by the belief that
a large number of new citizens ... (would benefit) the Clinton-Gore ticket in
the upcoming elections, put heavy and continuous pressure on the INS to
naturalize as many new citizens as possible."</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners wishing to become naturalized US citizens must pay $95 and have
lived in the US for at least five years  (or three, if they are married to a US
citizen), be of good moral character (no felony convictions), be of sound mind
and speak and understand English (unless they are elderly or disabled).  A fee
of $95 is charged.  They must pass a 10- to 12-question test on US history and
civics based on a list of 100 questions and answers provided by the INS, among
them:  "What is the White House?" "Where is the White House located?" and "Name
one right guaranteed by the First Amendment."</tt><p>

<tt>About 1.5 million of the nation's four million adult welfare recipients are
likely to lose welfare benefits in the next few years and an additional 800,000
will lose their food stamps.  Beginning on December 1, 1996, each state will
receive a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant--a lump sum
amount that will not change for five years.</tt><p>
<tt>One-third of the aged recipients of Supplemental Security Income are non-US
citizens.  Two-thirds of the non-citizen elderly on SSI are in California, New
York and Florida.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is likely to be asked to permit a number of state programs to
access its data base to determine the legal status of applicants for state
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-Texas) in November
asserted that he would oppose Clinton administration efforts to allow non-US
citizens to continue to obtain welfare benefits.  The Ways and Means
Committee's Green Book says that the US spent $4.5 trillion on "means-tested
programs" between 1968 and 1994.</tt><p>
<tt><u>California</u>.  California in November made plans to make illegal
aliens ineligible for benefits funded by state taxes after December 1, 1996,
including prenatal care for pregnant women.  Among the programs whose clients
may be asked about their immigration status are those for early breast-cancer
detection; child-abuse prevention; foster care; abortion and family planning
services; and assistance for the deaf and disabled.</tt><p>
<tt>California will cut welfare payments for 2.7 million recipients on January
1, 1997, by 4.9 percent to $565 for a family of three in urban areas, and by
9.8 percent to $538 for a family of three in 41 rural counties.  Welfare checks
written in December 1996 count against the maximum two years and then work, and
maximum five years of lifetime assistance limits.</tt><p>
<tt>California counties are holding hearings to determine whether to begin
requiring proof of legal US residence before providing services at tax-funded
county clinics.  If the counties turn away illegal aliens, they will have to
get medical services either in hospital emergency rooms or in private "free
clinics."  In Sacramento county, for example, an estimated 630 unauthorized
aliens received medical care at county clinics in 1995, at an estimated cost of
$300,000.  All persons were made eligible for services at county hospitals in
1982.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Texas</u>.  In Texas, leaders of the border county of Zavala believe
that the new welfare law will bring hardship.  Zavala County has the highest
percentage of Texas residents receiving Aid to Families With Dependent
Children, is third in Texas in the proportion of food stamp recipients and
fourth in the percentage of Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries.  The
$281 average weekly wage in the county is half the state average, reflecting
the fact that most residents are seasonal agricultural workers.  More than 90
percent of the students in the Crystal City school district cannot afford 75
cents for lunch. </tt><p>
<tt>Economists see little hope for job creation in the area.  One town resident
observed that even if 10 million jobs were created in the area, 12 million
people would move up from central Mexico to take the jobs. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Massachusetts</u>.  The state estimates that the new welfare law will
eliminate AFDC, Food Stamp and disability benefits for 30,000 legal immigrants.
The state plans to use some of its $80 million windfall under the new welfare
law to create state-funded programs that will assist legal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Poverty</u>.  In 1995, some 36 million US residents, 14 percent of the
population, lived in households with incomes below poverty level.  The poverty
line-- calculated as three times what a family needs to spend to eat-- was
$15,569 for a family of four and $12,158 for a family of three in 1995.
</tt><p>
<tt>The median household income was $34,076 in 1995, meaning that half of the
nation's 100 million households had higher and half had lower incomes.</tt><p>
<tt>For the first time, the Census Bureau released poverty data on native- and
foreign-born residents:  13 percent of the US-born residents were poor,
compared with 28 percent of the foreign-born who were not naturalized US
citizens.  Native-born households had median incomes of $34,800, while
households headed by foreign-born persons had median incomes of $28,400.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, 9.1 percent of US households headed by a foreign-born person and
7.4 percent of households headed by a person born in the US received cash
assistance from a program such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children or
Supplemental Security Income.</tt><p>
<tt>More comprehensive data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
reveals that the immigrant-native welfare gap widens when non-cash benefits
such as Food Stamps, Medicaid and housing subsidies are included.  Medicaid
accounts for about half of the almost $200 billion spent annually on these
programs.  In 1990-91, about 21 percent of the households headed by immigrants,
compared to 14 percent of households headed by US-born persons, were receiving
a cash or non-cash federal benefit.  </tt><p>
<tt>Almost half of the households headed by persons from the Dominican Republic
and Vietnam received a cash or non-cash federal benefit in an average month in
1990-91.  About one-third or more of the households headed by persons from the
ex-USSR, Mexico and Central America received benefits.  Fewer than 10 percent
of the households headed by persons born in Korea received benefits.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Mexican
Migrants on the Chicken Trail</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Missouri.</u> The Los Angeles Times on November 10-12, 1996 ran a
three-part report on "the chicken trail," about the recruitment of poultry
workers along the US-Mexican border for employment in the southeast.</tt><p>
<tt>The stories profiled Hudson Foods, based in Noel, Missouri, (population
1,169), which paid a south Texas recruiter, B. Chapman &amp; Co., $175 for each
worker who showed up in Missouri for the $6.70 per hour jobs.  The reporter
told how workers made their way north on the "chicken trail" to work for Hudson
and live in a converted motel, along with 135 other migrant poultry workers,
for $45 per week per person.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Hudson employed about 1,200 workers to process 1.3 million
chickens each week in Noel.  Annual turnover exceeds 100 percent, so that
Hudson hires about 50 new workers each month.  Hudson employees are represented
by a union.  About 45 percent of the labor force are Latinos.  Hudson paid a
$20,625 INS fine in 1992 because many of them were not authorized to work.
Hudson offers current employees who bring new workers to the plant a $300
bonus.</tt><p>
<tt>Hudson, the country's seventh largest-poultry producer, with headquarters
in Rogers, Arkansas, has 14 facilities in 11 states, more than 10,000 employees
and expects $1.4 billion in sales for 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The reporter-worker described the wet, the 47-degree temperature inside the
plant, the semi-automated "dis-assembly" line and the lack of training for
newly hired workers.  The number of broiler chickens processed in the US each
year has more than doubled, from three billion per year in the early 1970s to
seven billion per year in the mid-1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>Hudson's human resources director was quoted as saying: "there's a large
number of jobs that very few citizens in the US want to do, but they're there
and they need to be done...One of the social goods the poultry industry
provides is employing people who would otherwise have a great deal of trouble
getting employed."</tt><p>
<tt>The labor recruiting company travels to industry shows in search of
employers seeking unskilled labor and then offers to recruit workers for theses
companies.  According to the reporter, the recruiting company checked workers'
identification cards and took urine samples on the particular trip reported.
The Border Patrol checked the Greyhound passengers identification cards in
Falfurrias, about 75 miles north of the Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, The motel owner bought the run-down hunting lodge motel for
$220,000 and reopened it to house migrant chicken workers.  Because poultry
work is considered nonfarm work, it is not subject to special farm worker
housing inspection, only normal local health and safety screening.  The motel
management takes every new Hudson worker to apply for food stamps at the
Division of Family Services and the number of Latinos receiving food stamps in
Noel increased from 35 per month in 1993 to 375 per month in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Hudson is the economic linchpin of Noel, Missouri, but Hudson pays no
property taxes to the city.  The number of Latino students in Noel's elementary
school rose from 25 to more than 100.  Hudson and nearby Simmons Foods
contributed $12,000 to Noel schools in 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>The final article in the series concluded that, across rural and small town
America, jobs that "used to offer working-class security to a local population"
are now filled by Latino immigrants.  The article concluded that towns without
traffic lights and ATMs are not well equipped to deal with bilingual education,
overcrowded housing, and racial tensions.</tt><p>
<tt>There are weekly reports of INS raids on food processing facilities or of
unauthorized aliens detected by local police.  For example, on November 21,
1996, 10 unauthorized workers were apprehended at the Hi-Point Beef Co., a
meat processing plant in Bellefontaine, Ohio.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 40 unauthorized aliens were apprehended in late October in Idaho
Falls, Idaho, the tenth INS raid in the area in 1996, prompting criticism that
the INS detained and removed the parents of children in school from the US
before they had time to tell their children.  Most of the inspections were of
potato processing and similar facilities.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Tobacco</u>. The Virginia Agricultural Growers Association imported
2,603 Mexican workers to harvest tobacco under the H-2A program.  The H-2A
program requires that US employers offer to US workers, and pay to foreign
workers, an Adverse Effect Wage Rate of $5.80 per hour in 1996 in Virginia.
The H-2A program also requires US farm employers to provide free housing to
workers and to pay the workers' round trip transportation.  Farmers have to
guarantee workers employment for at least 75 percent of a 44-hour work week, or
33 hours.  H-2A tobacco workers in Virginia earn about $3,000 a summer, and
$5,500 if they stay for six months.  </tt><p>
<tt>H-2A tobacco workers are recruited in Mexico by Del-Al Associates of San
Antonio, Texas.  The Mexicans obtain visas to enter the US at the American
consulate in Monterrey.  Mexican H-2A tobacco workers pay $30 to the local
recruiter who found them, and  $125 to Del-Al Associates, which includes $44
for the US visa and an $81 recruitment fee.  There is reportedly a blacklist
that can get Mexican workers excluded from participation in the H-2A program.
</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican workers are also recruited under the nonfarm H-2B program to work
in the Virginia and North Carolina crab meat industry.  In 1996, eight Virginia
crabmeat processors hired 143 Mexicans under the H-2B program and 27 North
Carolina seafood houses got Department of Labor approval to hire 1,685 H-2B
Mexican workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the seafood processors said that, when their local Black women
employees retired, they could not "compete against the welfare programs of the
United States government" for local workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Unlike farm workers hired under the H-2A program, H-2B workers do not
receive written contracts that guarantee them a certain amount of work at a
government set wage.  Most H-2B crab workers are paid piece rate wages of $1.35
to $1.89 per pound and most workers can extract 18 to 40 pounds of crabmeat per
day, for daily earnings of  $25 to $67.  Seafood processors sell crab meat for
$6 to $13 per pound.</tt><p>
<tt>All workers must earn at least the federal minimum wage, $4.75 per hour,
which generally means that workers must clean at least 750 crabs over eight
hours to obtain 25 pounds of crab meat.  Workers are entitled to 1.5 times
their base wages for hours in excess of 40 weekly, a requirement that employers
often violate.</tt><p>
<tt>Most seafood processors provide housing for workers, at a cost of $15 to
$25 per week for beds in mobile homes or converted motels,  The workers pay
about $100 for bus tickets from Mexico to Virginia or North Carolina.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers are reportedly seeking jobs in construction, on tobacco
farms  and in meat and poultry plants in Kentucky.  In October, 1996, the INS
won its first conviction of an employer in Kentucky, the Valley Fresh chicken-
processing plant in Glasgow, for knowingly hiring illegal alien workers.  Wages
were $5 hourly.  </tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1996, Kentucky police stopped a rented truck taking 31
illegal aliens to North Carolina, but the short-staffed INS told the police to
let the truck continue its journey.</tt><p>

Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a>
Changes?</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a></a></h2>
<tt>Legal immigration is expected to return as a major issue in the 105th
Congress, which begins its work in January 1997.  Current law anticipates the
admission of 675,000 immigrants each year within numerically limited
categories. Although about 900,000 legal immigrants in all categories were
admitted in FY96, plus an additional 100,000 asylum seekers and parolees.  An
estimated 200,000 US citizens and immigrants emigrate every year.</tt><p>
<tt>The extremes in the new Congress are marked by proponents of the status
quo, and those who advocate a moratorium that would halt all legal immigration
except for the immediate families of US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The bipartisan US Commission on Immigration Reform, established by the 1990
Immigration Act, will issue its final recommendations in September 1997.  The
CIR in June 1995 recommended that the basic legal immigration system remain in
place, but that the entry of nuclear families be speeded up by awarding the
immigration slots now available to the adult brothers and sisters of US
citizens to immediate relatives. </tt><p>
<tt>The CIR also recommended that the number of slots for immigrants requested
by US employers be reduced and that US employers demonstrate that they looked
for US workers by paying a fee into a fund that would be used to train
Americans who could eventually fill the jobs now done by foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>The President endorsed the CIR's recommendation for a lowering of the
overall number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the country annually, but
negated that endorsement in March 1996, when his administration backed efforts
to separate legal and illegal immigration proposals in Congress.  The death of
the Chairman of the Commission, former Rep. Barbara Jordan (D-Texas), in
January 1996, is widely seen as a factor in the Clinton administration's change
of heart.</tt><p>
<tt>The three major doors through which legal immigrants enter the US
are:</tt><p>
<tt><u>Family Unification</u>.  Congressional critics of the current law assert
that chain migration rather than US needs is increasing the number of
immigrants admitted to the US for family reasons.  The US admits without limit
spouses and minor children of US citizens, so that the current naturalization
wave is expected to increase immediate family immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>After immediate families of US citizens, the US has four family immigration
preferences:  the parents of US citizens, the immediate families of US
immigrants and the adult brothers and sisters of US citizens. </tt><p>
<tt>There are lengthy backlogs in these categories.  The CIR recommended a
trade off, more slots to speed up the unification of immediate families of
legal immigrants and the elimination of slots for brothers and sisters.</tt><p>
<tt>In an effort to head off a debate over reducing legal immigration, Empower
America in November 1996 released, "In Defense of a Nation: The Military
Contributions of Immigrants," a report that argues that immigration increases
national security by adding to the US population, by adding scientists who
develop military technology and through individual acts of heroism by newcomers
in the armed forces.  The report was released at a press conference attended by
a Mexican immigrant who won a silver star fighting in Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Employment</u>.  The major bill in the House in 1996 would have reduced
the number of immigrants admitted annually for economic/employment reasons from
140,000 annually to 135,000(including dependents), while the Senate bill would
have reduced the number to 90,000.  Both bills would have reformed the H-1B
program, which admits a maximum 65,000 professional temporary foreign workers
each year, each for up to six years.</tt><p>
<tt>Business groups, especially high-tech companies such as Microsoft, opposed
any changes to the economic/employment-based immigration system.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Refugees</u>. The US adopted the UN definition of a refugee in 1980:  a
refugee is a person outside her country of citizenship with a well-founded fear
of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a
particular social group, or political opinion.  The 1980 act anticipated the
normal arrival of 50,000 refugees each year and pledged the federal government
to reimburse states for the welfare and other costs associated with resettling
refugees.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Non-Immigrants</u>.  Some 22 million foreigners enter the US every year,
most for short-term tourist or business visits.  However, about 650,000 are
admitted each year for US jobs or to study in the US.  Many of these
non-immigrants are authorized to remain in the US for three to 10 years and
many find ways to become permanent residents.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Population Impacts</u>.  About one-third of US population growth is due
to immigration and, if the US-born and US-citizen children of recent immigrants
are included, immigration accounts for more than half of US population growth,
according to the Census Bureau.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is increasing the size of the current and future population.
In 1989, the Census Bureau projected that the US population, 265 million in
1996, would level off at 300 million in 2050.  The most recent projections
suggest that the US population will be 400 million in 2050.  About 93 percent
of the population growth in the year 2050 will result from immigration that has
occurred since 1991.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, there were more Hispanic than Black babies born in the US--17
percent of the 3.9 million babies born were Hispanic, compared to 16 percent
Black, five percent Asian and 62 percent non-Hispanic white.  Hispanics are
expected to surpass Blacks as the largest US minority population in
2005.</tt><p>

<tt>The INS announced that it removed from the US 67,100 illegal aliens in
FY96, and 160,000 over the past three years.  About 55 percent of the aliens
removed committed crimes in the US and many are removed as they leave US
prisons.  About 75 percent of those removed in FY96 were Mexicans.</tt><p>
<tt>In FY96, the INS conducted 4,900 worksite operations that resulted in the
removal of 14,000 unauthorized workers.  In a first-ever agreement, the INS in
October 1996 announced that it would notify the Virginia Department of Social
Services when it removed unauthorized workers from jobs in that state.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 13, 1996, the US Supreme Court ruled that the INS could
consider the fraud an alien committed in entering the country when deciding
whether the person should be deported.  The ruling overturned the opinion of an
appeals court that said that, because the INS generally disregards fraudulent
acts committed by people trying to gain entry, INS must exclude from
consideration any fraudulent acts connected to how one ultimately got into the
United States.</tt><p>
<tt>The case involved a couple from China who moved to Taiwan, and divorced
there.  The wife, using fraudulent documents, then assumed the identity of a US
citizen.  The couple remarried in Taiwan under false names and the man used his
wife's apparent US citizenship to immigrate.  The wife, meanwhile, divorced her
husband under her true name to obtain a US immigration visa through US resident
relatives.</tt><p>
<tt>In late November, the INS issued an arrest warrant for Governor Wilson's
ex-maid; the maid's questionable legal status was detected in 1995, during
Wilson's brief campaign for the Republican nomination for President.  The INS
suspects that the maid may have fraudulently married a US citizen to become a
legal immigrant.</tt><p>
<tt>On the US-Mexican border, environmental and public officials expressed more
concern about unauthorized migrants threatening fragile plants in the Otay
Mountains in eastern San Diego county.  There have been more than 322 fires so
far in 1996 in the Otay Mountains.  The rugged terrain means that mostly young
men attempt the trip.</tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, in an October 27, 1996 interview with the
New York Times magazine, said that Congress was right in maintaining the
distinction between legal and illegal immigration in 1996 legislation.
However, she faulted Congress with not doing enough to help the INS enforce
employer sanctions.</tt><p>
<tt>Meissner noted that denying welfare benefits to legal immigrants
represented a major change in the US social contract and disputed the notion
that illegal alien women are increasing numbers are motivated enter the US to
give birth to US citizen babies.  She noted that US citizen children cannot
sponsor their parents for immigration until they are 21.</tt><p>

<tt>Gaps between the rich and poor in Mexico and between the industrial
northern and indigenous southern parts of the country, are widening.  There
have been many skirmishes in Mexico's so-called misery belt--Chiapas, Oaxaca
and Guerrero.  One-fourth of the population is illiterate, compared with six
percent along the northern border.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 9, 1996 police shot and killed three protesting Mexican
peasants in Chiapas.  The peasants were demanding a doubling in the base price
for corn, from the government-guaranteed price of about $160 per ton to $315 a
ton.</tt><p>
<tt>One recent study 55 percent of all Mexicans are poor and working class, 35
percent are middle class, and 10 percent are upper class.  Only one-third of
the poor and working class have jobs that bring in regular wages and salaries.
Mexico's informal or non-tax paying sector represents about 39 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).</tt><p>
<tt>Two-thirds of the 14 million people that Mexico classifies as "living in
extreme poverty" are in rural areas. Mexican President Zedillo on November 8,
1996 said that the average adult Mexican has seven years of education, up from
one year of schooling in 1950.</tt><p>
<tt>Many US investors are reportedly postponing plans to invest in Mexico
because of concerns about kidnappings and the persistence of bureaucratic
problems.</tt><p>
<tt>Zedillo announced the government's 1997 budget on November 7, 1996.  It
projects a 1997 GDP of about $360 billion, four percent growth and 15 percent
inflation.  The peso/dollar exchange rate is expected to fall from the current
7.7 pesos to $1 to about 8.5 to $1.  Exports of about $100 billion are expected
to approach 25 percent of GDP.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's economy grew by 7.4 percent in the third quarter of 1996, up from
7.2 percent in the second quarter.  The US has been importing about $6 billion
worth of goods from Mexico each month in 1996 and exporting goods worth $4.5
billion, producing a $1.5 billion monthly US trade deficit with Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico and other Latin American countries continue to try to increase their
savings from the current 20 percent of GDP to the 30 percent more common in
East Asia.  </tt><p>
<tt>In October 1996, unemployment fell to 5.2 percent in 41 cities, the lowest
level since January 1995.  Unemployment peaked at 7.6 percent in August 1995.
Mexico considers persons 12 and older who actively sought a job in the two
months before the survey to be in the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>In voting in November, opposition parties won enough mayorships to control
10 of the 12 largest Mexican cities.  In response, the PRI-dominated 500-member
Chamber of Deputies backtracked on election reforms that were meant to open up
the political process.  Over the protest of opposition parties, the Chamber
approved plans to spend $250 million in government funds in the July 6, 1997
congressional races, about half of which will go to PRI candidates.  </tt><p>
<tt>PRI has governed Mexico for 67 years -- the longest uninterrupted reign of
any governing party in the world.</tt><p>
<tt>Some experts wonder what the impact will be when Mexicans living in the US
have their first opportunity to vote in Mexico's next election.  If, as
expected, the PAN manages to edge the PRI in Mexico, a poor showing among
Mexican voters living in the United States would critically diminish the PAN's
share of the total presidential tally.  In the close election everyone is
expecting, a large unfavorable vote from the US could reinstall the PRI through
2006.</tt><p>
<tt>The estimated four to five million Mexican voters living in the US are a
huge unknown in the election and each party has a different approach to
reaching these voters.  The PRI was responsible for giving Mexicans living in
the US the right to vote, hoping to win their support.  The PAN has no strategy
for the voters north of the border.  The PRD has extensive networks of voters
through the US and pushed for emigrant voting rights. </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico plans to "register" Guatemalan refugees in Campeche, Quitana Roo and
Chiapas in December 1996, so that a "legalization process for certain migrants"
can be carried out.</tt><p>
<tt>In Guatemala, it was announced that a 36-year civil war would end with a
peace treaty to be signed in Guatemala City on December 29, 1996.  During
Central America's last and longest civil war, some 100,000 people died, and an
estimated 40,000 disappeared.</tt><p>
<tt>A Bank of Boston survey released in November found that 57 percent of US
residents do not want NAFTA to be extended to other Latin American countries,
in part because 51 percent believe that free trade agreements cost the US
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>During his first term, President Clinton did not visit Latin America except
for a quick trip to Haiti to visit American troops.  Many Latin American
diplomats say the US largely ignores Latin America and has no clear policy
toward the region, except for trying to suppress narcotics.  The Clinton
administration says it does plan a presidential visit to Latin America next
year, although no firm date has been set. </tt><p>
<tt>Other Latin American specialists take a more favorable point of view,
pointing out that the Clinton administration acted decisively in response to
the Mexican peso crisis of 1994.  The multibillion-dollar bailout was a
landmark in US-Latin American relations. </tt><p>
<tt>Trade is expected to be the top issue in US-Latin American relations during
Clinton's second term.  A Free Trade Area of the Americans, agreed to at the
1994 Miami summit, should be established by 20005.  </tt><p>

<tt>Largely because of changes in immigration laws in 1965, the United States
"is now the most religiously diverse country on earth," according to an article
in the September-October, 1996 issue of Harvard magazine.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to Professor Martin Marty of the University of Chicago, a
religion has "six marks"--a system centered on a matter of deep meaning,
socialization (believers tend to form communities), show a preference for
symbolic language over everyday speech, use ceremonies (especially at birth,
marriage and death), take a metaphysical view of life (there is more to the
world than what one sees) and require behavioral adjustments (attending Sunday
School or shunning pork).</tt><p>
<tt>Some social scientists consider that religious institutions to be of the
most important sources of social capital in the US--institutions that can
create the social networks and norms that enable people to work together for
common goals.  Churches, in this view, teach people basic political skills--
how to give a speech, organize a meeting, raise money and provide pools of
friends and neighbors who can be recruited for civic activities.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Protestants</u>.  Many traditional Protestant denominations are
welcoming immigrants and hope to thereby bolster declining membership.</tt><p>
<tt>It has not always been easy to integrate immigrants.  The First United
Methodist Church in Queens, New York was troubled in 1995 by divisions between
Filipino immigrants and African Americans.  The pastor of the church tried to
bring in new lay ministers, but was removed by the Bishop, prompting some of
the immigrant members to picket the Bishop's office.  In Queens, churches that
rely on immigrants who joined long ago are dying--one has 30 elderly
Polish-American members, another only five German-American members.</tt><p>
<tt>The United Methodist Church has lost about two million members nationwide
in 10 years.  Membership is growing in communities with Korean, Caribbean,
African and Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Most Americans attend neighborhood churches and their attendance patterns
reflect housing patterns.  Martin Luther King in the 1960s asserted that 11 am
on Sunday morning was the most segregated hour of the week, as
African-Americans and whites went to separate churches.  There are very few
racially-integrated churches in the US.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Catholics</u>.  The Pope's October 1995 visit to New York highlighted
the ethnic diversity of Catholic parishes brought about by continuing
immigration.  Churches built by German or Irish or Italian immigrants decades
ago now celebrate Mass in Spanish or Polish.  Mass is celebrated in New York
area churches in 38 languages.</tt><p>
<tt>Before his 1995 visit, the Pope released a statement asking established
residents to try to understand the circumstances of illegal immigrants.  "The
illegal immigrant," the Pope said, "comes before us like that stranger whom
Jesus asks to be recognized."  The Pope called for international cooperation to
foster political stability and accelerate economic development so that people
are not forced to migrate.</tt><p>
<tt>In an address to the United Nations in 1995 the Pope deplored the "fear of
difference" that he said can lead to violations of human rights.</tt><p>
<tt>Catholic leaders make a point of saying that no passport or papers are
required to enter their churches, thus reproving those with less welcoming
attitudes to immigrants.  Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahoney decried Prop.
187 in California in Fall 1994 as a "social sin," and pastoral letters in New
York and elsewhere remind listeners that Catholic teaching instructs that
immigrants should be treated with hospitality.</tt><p>
<tt>A nationwide September 1995 poll conducted in English and Spanish found
that about the same percentage of Catholics as respondents in general--28
percent--want immigration levels reduced.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 22 million Hispanic Catholics in the United States,
about a third of the country's 66 million Catholics.  About a fourth of the
Hispanic Catholics were born outside the US.</tt><p>
<tt>California's Catholic priests are becoming more outspoken on issues such as
affirmative action and prenatal care for undocumented immigrants, a major
change from their previous behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts.  A group of
clerics representing the state's 12 dioceses met with elected officials in
Sacramento in March, 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>According to a spokesperson, the group's advocacy is a mandate from the
state's 5.6 million Hispanic Catholics whom they represent, and also reflects
the church's traditional concern for the poor, elderly and children.  The group
became more outspoken after a November 1995 pastoral statement from the US
Catholic Conference of Bishops that urged Catholics to become more active
politically as a community conscience. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Islam.</u>  There are six to eight million Muslims in the US, including
two million Black Muslims.  The number of Muslims in the US is increasing
rapidly through immigration and conversions.  Islam, now with one billion
adherents, is the world's fastest-growing religion.   </tt><p>
<tt>Of the more than 1,200 mosques in the US, nearly 80 percent have been built
within the past 12 years.  The first theological school in the US to train
Islamic imams opened in Virginia in 1996.  In the past two years, six mosques
have been damaged or destroyed by arson.</tt><p>
<tt>Experts say that Islam, with its clearly defined behavioral norms, is
particularly appealing to American blacks living in neighborhoods where
community and family life have been strained by poverty, crime and despair.
Islam also provides an alternative for some blacks who associate Christianity
with slavery and racism. For some, Islam is a bridge to their African roots--
as many as 20 percent of the slaves transported to America may have been
Muslims.</tt><p>
<tt>At a private Islamic school in Silver Spring, Maryland, girls who wear the
hijab, or traditional Muslim head scarf, do not have to worry about teasing by
their classmates.  Islamic schools in the Washington, DC area are popular; most
have long waiting lists.  The American Muslim Council estimates that there are
200,000 Muslims in the Washington DC area and 1,500 pupils in Islamic schools.
Many Muslim parents who cannot get their children into Islamic school opt to
homeschool.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Muslims, both immigrant and American-born, are organizing to increase
their political clout.  Most are liberal on minority rights and immigration,
but conservative in such matters as opposing sex and violence in movies and
television.  In California, home to the largest Muslim community in the US,
most Muslims supported Republican Pete Wilson in the governor's race, but most
opposed Prop. 187. </tt><p>

<tt>A survey found that 52 percent of graduating US high school students think
the US has too many immigrants.  More than half believe that immigration and
affirmative action will make it harder for them to get into the best
universities and to find good jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Wall Street Journal on November 13, 1996 reported that more employees
who are bilingual are demanding and getting additional wages.  The prevailing
stated policy of US employers has been to set wages by the job, not according
to the qualifications of the person filling the job, so most US employers have
not paid premium wages for workers with bilingual skills.  Management jobs, on
the other hand, often offer wage premiums for bilingual skills.</tt><p>
<tt>Bilingual skills used on the job have brought wage premiums of five to 10
percent to US Customs inspectors and MCI operators.  In some cases, wage
premiums for bilingual employees have led to grievances from non-bilingual
employees.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York City, a new magazine, City Family, is aimed at low- and
middle-income immigrants trying to make a better life for themselves.  About
210,000 copies are sold each month, half in Spanish as the La Familia de la
Ciudad.  The magazine, aimed at women, is written at a fifth-grade level.  The
magazine is distributed free in places where immigrants congregate as well as
by subscription.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Affirmative Action</u>.  California voters, 54 to 46 percent, approved
Proposition 209 in November 1996, an initiative that eliminates quotas and
preferences in state and local government university admissions, contracting
and hiring. Proposition 209 amends the California Constitution to read, "The
state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any
individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national
origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public
contracting."</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson immediately issued an executive order directing state
agencies to identify programs that grant or encourage preferences based on race
or sex.</tt><p>
<tt>Men voted two to one for Prop. 209, as did 60 percent of white women.
About one-third of Black and Hispanic voters supported Prop. 209.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Hmong</u>.  There are about 60,000 Hmong refugees from Southeast Asia in
California's San Joaquin Valley cities of Fresno, Merced and Tulare.  About 70
percent are on public assistance, the highest rate of any immigrant group.  The
Hmong are considered to be most disadvantaged refugee group ever to come to
America.  Many are not literate and most live in ethnic enclaves.  Some of
their customs clash with the mores of established residents, including having
girls marry at 13 and many women having nine or 10 children. </tt><p>
<tt>Hmong community leaders say that in 1996 about 6,000 Hmong have left the
San Joaquin Valley for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon and elsewhere.  They
attribute the departures to the prospect of losing welfare benefits and to
better job prospects elsewhere.  Many have moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, which
has 32,000 Hmong residents.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1960s, the Hmong were recruited by the CIA to fight the Viet Cong
and suffered the highest casualty rates of any group of combatants in the
Vietnam War.  To many of the 125,000 Hmong who made their way to the US,
welfare benefits are no more than a proper reward for having fought in an
American cause.</tt><p>

<tt>The EU's on-going inter-governmental conference (IGC) is set to approve
majority voting for employment promotion and environmental protection.
However, Irish negotiators preparing for the Dublin summit said that there were
"major inhibitions" on questions of citizenship and nationality becoming an EU
responsibility.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Commissioner responsible for issues related to immigration and
judicial affairs, Anita Gradin, visited Morocco's northern provinces in
November to discuss drug trafficking and illegal immigration in Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU provided about $116 billion in regional aid in 1996.  Much of the
aid goes to the "poor four" EU members--Ireland, Portugal Spain, and Greece.
In a review of disparities within the EU, it was noted that Ireland's per
capita GDP is now 90 percent of the EU average, while Greece's is still only 64
percent of the average.  Hamburg is the richest city in the EU--its per capita
GDP is 189 percent of average, followed by Brussels at 183 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The Cecchini report in 1988 projected that the "single market" would add
4.5 percent to the GDP of the 12-nation EU, adding 1.8 million jobs.  On
October 30, 1996, the EU released a report on the first four years of the
single market and it estimated that the GDP of the now 15-nation EU was 1.1 to
1.5 percent higher than it would have been without the removal of market
barriers and that a net 300,000 to 900,000 new jobs were created.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The German Bundestag in November approved changes to immigration laws that
permit the expulsion of foreigners convicted of "severe" disruption of the
peace at an unauthorized protest rally.  The law was a response to Kurdish
protests in Spring 1996 against the Turkish government.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany continues to debate eased naturalization procedures.  Persons who
have a right (Anspruch) to German nationality do not have to take a language
test, while those who are permitted (Ermessen) to apply for naturalization must
satisfy residence, language and other requirements.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the proposals would ease the requirements for the
Ermessenseinbuergerung, such as reducing the residence requirement for persons
born in Germany, or giving persons born in Germany the right to become German
nationals at age 16 or 18.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians/Serbs. </u> Germany and Bosnia-Herzegovina in November signed a
final agreement to return home the 320,000 Bosnians in Germany.  Until June
1997, only single people and couples without children will return.</tt><p>
<tt>German courts in August ruled that Bosnians "tolerated" in Germany do not
have the right to apply for asylum in Germany because the Bosnian government
can protect them within the borders of Bosnia.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and Yugoslavia signed an agreement October 10, 1996 to begin return
135,000 mostly Kosovo-Albanians on December 1, 1996.  The return of the persons
to Serbia is expected to take three years.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  On November 5, 1996, a minister charged with providing
"church asylum" to a Roma gypsy between 1994 and 1996 went on trial, the first
time a person involved in church asylum was put on trial in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in October was 11, 677.</tt><p>
<tt>In the first seven months of 1996, 489 rejected asylum seekers appealed to
the German Constitutional Court and eight were found to have been
unconstitutionally rejected.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Aussiedler</u>.  Germany accepts up to 220,000 ethnic Germans per year
from the ex-USSR.  The SPD has been urging the coalition government to make
this annual quota flexible, reducing the number admitted when German
unemployment and funds to provide integration assistance decline.  The German
government reduced integration assistance for Aussiedler, but kept the quota at
220,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany requires ethnic Germans to complete their applications and to
demonstrate some knowledge of German, before they leave Kazackstan and Russia
for Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 3.5 million Aussiedler migrated to Germany since 1950, including 1.3
million from the ex-USSR, 420,000 from Romania, and 104,000 from the
ex-Czechoslovakia.  The peak year of Aussiedler migration was 1990, when
397,999 persons arrived.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese</u>.  On November 1, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, the German
government official with responsibility for foreigners, called for a permanent
right of abode for Vietnamese workers in the former East Germany.  Following
reunification, East Germany's foreign worker population dropped from 90,000
Angolans, Cubans, Hungarians, Mozambicans and Vietnamese to 15,000, including
13,000 Vietnamese. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the former East German guest workers received an
Aufenthaltsbefugnis in 1993-94, a residence permit that can be renewed every
two years if the foreigner can prove that he has appropriate housing and no
receipt of welfare or record of crime.  After four renewals or eight years of
lawful residence, the Vietnamese are eligible for an Aufenthaltserlaubnis, a
more secure residence permit.</tt><p>
<tt>Under current law, residence before 1993-94 does not count for the
Vietnamese seeking to qualify for an Aufenthaltserlaubnis.  One proposal is to
count half of the years before 1993 toward the eight-year requirement and to
permit those convicted of minor crimes to obtain residence permits.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of xenophobic violent crimes against foreigners living in
Germany fell from 382 in the first eight months of 1995 to 200 in the same
period in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Illegal Immigration</u>.  At the end of August, 1996, the<u> </u>German
Border Patrol announced that it had apprehended 29,604 illegal aliens
attempting to enter Germany over its eastern borders in 1995, down about five
percent from 1995.  Those apprehended represented an estimated 80 percent of
illegal entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>An additional 125,742 foreigners were turned back at the border and 36,455
were flown out of Germany by the German Border Patrol.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>.  Unemployment in October rose to over four million or
10.6 percent of the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>About three million foreigners were employed in Germany in April 1995.
About 37 percent were employed in manufacturing, 22 percent in services such as
hotels and restaurants, 15 percent in other services, 11 percent in
construction and eight percent were self employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Schwarzarbeit--unauthorized foreigners and Germans working for unreported
wages--cost Germany an estimated DM100 million or $65 million per year in lost
income and payroll taxes.  There are an estimated 500,000 "illegal jobs" in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>German employers and construction unions in November 1996 agreed on a
minimum wage for all construction workers for the period January-August, 1997.
All workers on construction sites must be paid at least DM17 ($11.33) per hour
in the former west Germany and DM15.64 ($10.43) per hour in the east, which
would then become the minimum wage for foreign workers.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>An estimated 200,000 foreign workers and 350,000 German workers are
employed at German building sites.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, a total DM117 billion ($76 billion) was spent on unemployment
insurance, early retirement benefits and other programs for the jobless in
Germany.  An average 3.6 million people were unemployed in 1995, about 10
percent of the labor force.  </tt><p>
<tt>A report by the Council of Economic Advisors found that growth in east
Germany will be only 2.25 percent in 1997, which means that for the first time
since German reunification in 1990, the growth rate in the east will be slower
than in western Germany.  Construction has been the catalyst for east German
growth.  Productivity in east Germany remains 50 percent below that in the
west, but wages in the east are about 70 percent of western levels.</tt><p>
<tt>The German union confederation, the DGB, in November 1996 changed the
manifesto adopted in 1958 to accept more labor market flexibility.  The change
was pushed by IG Metall, the world's largest industrial union, with about three
million members, or one-third of DGB members.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Human rights</u>.  On November 8, a UN human rights committee criticized
the treatment of foreigners and minorities by German police and expressed
concern about continuing xenophobia and anti-Semitism in Germany.  The UN
committee recommended the establishment of independent bodies throughout
Germany to investigate complaints of ill treatment by the police.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Turks.</u>  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel visited Germany on
November 6 for talks with German officials regarding Turkey's bid for EU
membership, human rights and the security of Turks living in Germany.  Demirel
said that Turkish EU membership is only a question of time.  German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel responded that Turkey belongs to Europe and serves as a
bridge between Europe, Islam and Central Asia, but added that Turkey must
improve its human rights record. </tt><p>

Amends 1993 Immigration
Law</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The French cabinet on November 6, 1996 approved a bill that would remove
"anomalies" created by 1993 immigration laws, largely by increasing the power
of police to deal with illegal immigrants and make it easier for foreigners
with a French spouse or French children to obtain residence permits.</tt><p>
<tt>The bill would permit aliens who did not leave France as instructed to be
jailed for up to three months and permit police to conduct identity checks in
workplaces to crack down on illegal labor.</tt><p>
<tt>France's Human Rights Commission asked the French government on November 15
to review the entire 1993 immigration law because it violates human dignity
without resolving the problems of illegal immigration and labor.  The
commission said that the bill to remove the anomalies would clear up the status
of a number of immigrants but may threaten individual freedom and create a
special criminal law for foreigners which the commission believes would breach
the principle of equal justice. </tt><p>
<tt>In Dreux, a city of 36,000 45 miles west of Paris whose population is 20
percent immigrant, a mayoral contest highlighted the tensions between the
French and North African immigrants.  The National Front candidate said that
illegal immigrant children should not be permitted in French schools.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Front candidate, who promised to double the city's police
force to 40, won 36 percent of the vote in the first round. The National Front
Candidate lost in the run-off election on November 24 despite a visit to the
town by National Frond leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.  The incumbent may won 60.4
percent while the National Front candidate trailed with 36.4 percent.  National
Front mayors were elected in Toulon, Orange and Marignane.  </tt><p>
<tt>After the election, fighting between the conservative and National Front
supporters was reported. No one was seriously injured.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the North Africans live in high rises on the outskirts of the city
where unemployment and reliance on welfare are high.</tt><p>
<tt>The Economist in its November 16 issue summarized the French integration
model as one which expects newcomers to "speak French, eat French food, wear
French clothes, observe French customs." </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Jean-Claude Barreau, the adviser on immigration to the French
minister of the interior, was quoted as saying that "when somebody emigrates,
he changes not only his country, but also his history.  Foreigners arriving [to
settle] in France must understand that from henceforth their ancestors are the
Gauls and that they have a new homeland . . . But Muslim extremists have begun
arriving in France as colonizers, with gods and weapons in their baggage . . .
Today, there is a real Islamic threat in France which is part of a great
worldwide wave of Muslim fundamentalism."</tt><p>
<tt>France has four to five million Muslim residents.  About half are French
citizens, born in France or acquiring French nationality (by marriage or
naturalization) since their arrival. About six percent of the Muslims adhere to
the strict tenets of their faith and 10-15 percent worship regularly at a
mosque or prayer center, about the same percent of French Catholics who go
regularly to mass.</tt><p>
<tt>A 1996 poll found that two-thirds of the French think that France has "too
many Arabs" and "too many Muslims.".</tt><p>
<tt>High school students in the French Guiana capital Cayenne in South America
rioted in November; the French attributed the riots to illegal immigration,
which helped to increase the population to 140,000 from 80,000 over the past 13
years.  The unemployment rate is 25 percent.</tt><p>

<tt>Poland and Russia in November signed an agreement that permits visa-free

illegal immigrants from third countries who passed through Russia into

<tt>Poland has set up detention centers for foreigners awaiting deportation.

</a></h2>
<tt>An International Organization for Migration heard a plea to treat
prostitutes as migrant workers because they are forced by their economic
situation to cross borders to work as prostitutes.  Hungarian police estimate
that one-third of the prostitutes working in clubs, massage parlors and other
venues in Budapest are foreigners, primarily from countries east of
Hungary.</tt><p>
<tt>The City Council of Verona, Italy is attempting to halt a rise in
prostitution primarily by foreign women from Africa, Romania and Albania.  The
council suggested confining prostitution to a designated area of the city and a
reopening of brothels--much to the outrage of the Catholic Church.</tt><p>
<tt>The women are recruited with promises of high wage jobs but, after their
arrival, the smugglers destroy their documents and force them into
prostitution.  Italy's largest association of prostitutes charges that, since
the Italian authorities cannot control the influx of illegal immigrants, they
target the most visible immigrants--prostitutes.  </tt><p>
<tt>By the end of October, 1996, 12 persons were arrested in Belgium under a
1995 law that prohibits "trade in human beings."  Over the past four years, a
Belgian-based smuggling ring recruited an estimated 4,000 Filipinos by
promising them high wage jobs in Europe.  They then sent most of the Filipinos
to Italy as manual workers, maids or prostitutes.</tt><p>
<tt>The Filipinos paid up to $8,000 each to the smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Belgian law allows anyone who forces an immigrant to work against
his/her will to be charged with illegally trafficking in human labor.  Without
the new rule, any abused immigrant trying to get police protection would have
been immediately deported as an illegal alien before being able to testify at a
trial.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Ireland, a country of 3.6 million with a per capita GNP of $13,500 in 1994,
has heretofore been a country of emigration rather than a destination for
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Today Ireland has about 40,000 legal alien residents, including 2,000
asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions on whether they will be allowed to
remain in Ireland.  Most of the legal aliens have annually renewable
visas.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal aliens who have been married to an Irish citizen for three years are
automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.  Those not married to an Irish
citizen can apply to the Minister for Justice for Irish citizenship after five
years' legal residence in Ireland, although the Justice ministry does not have
to give any reason for refusing citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first nine months of 1996, 713 foreigners applied for asylum in
Ireland, versus 424 in 1995, 355 in 1994, 91 in 1993 and 39 in 1992.  The
largest group of asylum seekers are Romanians, followed by persons from Somalia
and Algeria.  In 1995, 14 foreigners were granted refugee status and eight were
given "humanitarian leave to remain" in Ireland.</tt><p>
<tt>At present, the authoritative statement of Ireland's refugee policy is a
1985 letter from the Irish Department of Justice to the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) outlining its commitment to the 1951 Geneva
Convention.  The practice has been to interview applicants for asylum and then
to await comments from the London office of UNHCR and the Irish Department of
Foreign Affairs.  Only after their advice was received was a final decision
reached, often after two to three years.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Irish authorities, these delays and some passengers on
Aeroflot planes seeking asylum during stopovers at Shannon Airport, contributed
to the 1,000 percent increase in the number of asylum seekers in the past three
years.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1996, Ireland approved a new Refugee Act that will go into effect in
1997.  It has an expansive definition of refugee, adding to the Geneva
Convention the possibility of receiving refugee status because of persecution
due to gender, sexual orientation or trade union membership.  In addition, the
Irish Refugee Act defines "family" broadly for the purpose of regulating family
reunion for refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>Asylum seekers in Ireland are prohibited from working, but are eligible for
public assistance.  If an asylum seeker becomes the parent of an Irish born
child or marries an Irish citizen, she or he gains the right of residency and
therefore the right to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Ireland in October 1996 deported to Algeria an Algerian man who was
returning to Ireland from a visit to France and did not have a re-entry visa.
The Algerian man had entered Ireland as a student in 1991, married an Irish
citizen in 1993 and remained in the country.  His brother, who owns a
restaurant in Dublin, obtained a court order to delay the man's deportation,
but he was sent to Algiers despite the court order.</tt><p>
<tt>Irish immigration laws, like US law, do not require the government to give
any reason for refusing to issue a visa.  There is no right to appeal the
decision of an immigration officer.</tt><p>

<tt>The Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs released in October 1996 a summary
of a Proposed Parliamentary Bill on Migration Policy.  If enacted, the bill
would reduce the number of asylum-seekers through more stringent eligibility
rules for family reunification and transfer responsibility for alien affairs
from the police to the Swedish Immigration Board.  </tt><p>
<tt>Two reasons cited by the Swedish government for the change in refugee
policy are the fiscal crisis in Sweden and the influx of persons from the
former Yugoslavia.  Sweden has provided shelter for 122,000 Bosnians, more than
any other nation, on a per capita basis. </tt><p>
<tt>The Swedish government WILL continue to grant refugee status to persons
fleeing areas in which the state fails to provide protection against
persecution by other agents.</tt><p>
<tt>In the past, Sweden has denied asylum to refugees suffering persecution by
non-governmental authorities, such as Peruvians targeted by the Shining Path or
Algerians persecuted by the insurgent Armed Islamic Group.  Denying protection
to such persons has been criticized by the Human Rights Watch. </tt><p>

<tt>On November 18, the Japanese government said it will grant Japanese
citizenship to a child born out of wedlock to a Filipina woman and a Japanese
man.  In a settlement worked out at the Hiroshima District Court, the
government said it would give Japanese nationality to the child and cancel the
deportation order for the child and the mother. </tt><p>
<tt>The government's decision followed a Justice Ministry announcement in July
1996 that divorced, separated, widowed or otherwise single foreigners--even
those illegally in Japan-- who are bringing up children with at least one
Japanese parent would be granted legal residency.  If a child is born to a
foreign women out of wedlock, the Japanese father must acknowledge the baby
before birth for the mother and child to remain in Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Japanese press reports, many municipalities have begun to
treat foreigners like ordinary residents; many no longer worry whether a
foreigner has overstayed his or her visa.  Local authorities are supposed to
report visa violations to the Immigration Bureau, but many do not.</tt><p>
<tt>Shinjuku Ward in Tokyo gives illegal foreign residents access to public
hospitals and schools.  Other local governments provide Japanese language
training, job placement assistance and classes on Japanese culture to foreign
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>Under current laws, local governments can hire foreign residents only if
they possess special skills, and if their job does not involve the "use of
public power." Local authorities would like to have more freedom to hire
foreign residents, especially for 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and
difficult--and to help to provide government services to the growing foreign
communities.</tt><p>
<tt>The governors and mayors of several cities that have large (and growing)
foreign populations, including the Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto governments, would
like to give foreign residents the right to vote in local elections.</tt><p>
<tt>The Fukuoka District Court sentenced 18 Chinese to one year in prison,
suspended for three to four years, for illegally entering Japan from a Chinese
fishing boat on August 22, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese birth rate hit an all-time low in 1995, down to 1.4 births per
woman.  If this low birth rate continues, Japan's population is projected to
fall from 125 million in 1996 to 55 million in the year 2100.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Japanese worry that a declining population could lead to costly
economic adjustments or a loss of world power and prestige.  Some local
governments offer financial rewards to mothers with four or more children and a
few are helping to arrange for the immigration of Filipino wives.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>In mid-November, some 2,000 police and border troops in China's Guangdong
province launched their second drill to prevent a sudden storming of the border
by Chinese citizens when the British colony reverts to Beijing's control in
July 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese authorities say they constantly battle rumors in Guangdong province
about a July 1997 amnesty for illegal immigrants in Hong Kong.  Guangdong
authorities have informed the Hong Kong police that criminal gangs on both
sides of the border tempt mainlanders with rumors of an amnesty to encourage
them to use their services to sneak into Hong Kong. </tt><p>
<tt>Newspaper reports in 1996 have said many mainland Chinese think that after
July 1997, they will be able to enter Hong Kong at will.  However, China plans
to keep Hong Kong as a distinct entity and to restrict immigration
tightly.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's governor has been trying to get pledges from the European Union
nations that they will allow Hong Kong passport holders visa-free entry after
July 1, 1997.  The Benelux nations, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the
United Kingdom currently allow visa-free access for holders of British national
overseas passports and Hong Kong Governor Patten would like these countries to
extend this right to the future holders of Special Administrative Region
passports, which Britain has agreed to do.  </tt><p>
<tt>China is expected to issue SAR passports to just under half of Hong Kong's
6.2 million residents.</tt><p>
<tt>Many EU nations are resisting visa-free entry for SAR passport holders for
fear that they would be opening themselves to Chinese immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>British citizens going to Hong Kong for employment, residency or education
will need to apply for a six-month visas before the July 1, 1997 transfer of
Hong Kong sovereignty to China.  The new visa will permit entry, but not work
or study.  This change will bring the immigration status of British citizens
into line with that of other foreign nationals in Hong Kong.  Previously,
Britons were allowed a 12-month unconditional stay in Hong Kong that permitted
work, study or vacation.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's immigration chief since May 1989, Laurence Leung, resigned
suddenly in July 1996 and there are rumors that he told Beijing which Hong Kong
residents had accepted the 50,000 British passports offered to restore
confidence after the Tiananmen Square Massacre.  Other reports say that Leung
was involved in the unauthorized provision of so-called "one-way permits" to
mainland Chinese moving to Hong Kong.  Leung's wife, Kitty, and two daughters
emigrated to Canada in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>There were reports in the press that Hong Kong's Secretary for Industry
admitted that political pressure compelled the government to adopt a labor
importation policy under which the quota of 5,000 imported workers was
eliminated.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since 1985, China's economy has grown by an average of 10.3 percent each
year.</tt><p>
<tt>An American entrepreneur has an unusual scheme to attract Chinese
investment in Fujian-- any Chinese mainlander who invests in and works for the
Fujian-based joint venture company can immigrate to the US.  Investors in the
company, which makes video cassette storage boxes, will receive stock in the
firm and a transfer to the US after they work for the company in Fujian for one
year.  </tt><p>
<tt>As US employees, they will receive health insurance, 24 paid holidays a
year and education and legal assistance.  After 15 months in the US, the
company will sponsor their applications for green cards. </tt><p>

<tt>The 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) met in Manila
on November 20-25, 1996 to discuss ways to achieve free trade between the
developed economy members by 2010 and for all APEC nations by 2020.  Two APEC
members, China and Taiwan, are not members of the World Trade

<tt>The Philippines is booming; its 70 million people have a GDP of almost $80
billion.  Economic growth will exceed seven percent in 1996 and per capita
income has risen to more than $1,000 per person per year.  However, the boom is
mostly an urban phenomena; inequality between rural and urban areas has
increased and two-thirds of Filipinos live in rural areas.</tt><p>

<tt>There are now 350,000 foreign workers employed in Singapore, nearly 12
percent of the population.  Most of the foreign workers in Singapore are from
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India.</tt><p>
<tt>Some believe that Singapore's reliance on foreign workers is hurting
productivity and slowing growth, especially in construction.  Construction
productivity has been falling for the last four years, a period that coincided
with the import of more foreign construction workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Cheap labor does not necessarily mean low costs.  According to a 1989
Construction Industry Development Board comparison study: in Dallas, Texas,
materials cost 80 per cent more and wages are six times higher than in
Singapore, but unit construction costs are only two to 15 per cent
higher.</tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore government will increase the maximum stay of skilled foreign
workers from eight to ten years to minimize employers' training costs.  About
seven percent of the foreign construction workers are skilled.  Construction
employers must pay a S$440 per month levy to the government companies for each
foreign worker they employ.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian workers can continue to renew their work permits every two years.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some contractors worry that once workers are trained they will continue to
job-hop or move to countries with higher pay such as Taiwan. </tt><p>
<tt>A Singapore court has ruled that building contractors who hire foreign
workers must check their documents instead of relying upon sub-contractors to
inspect workers' documents.  The ruling was made in September in the case of a
contractor who was sentenced to 16 months jail for employing and harboring two
illegal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Employers of foreign maids in Singapore were warned by the government on
November 21, that they faced fines if they deploy their workers to other
duties.  The Ministry of Labor reported that it found 59 cases in 1996 of
employers who had their domestics work for relatives or friends, often as
non-domestic workers in retail, food shops or factories.  </tt><p>
<tt>Singapore's work permits are valid only for the trade, occupation and
employer specified on the card.  Employers violating the law could face a fine
of up $3,500 US and/or a jail term of up to one year. </tt><p>

with Foreign
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The South Korean government plans to import 1,500 skilled foreign workers
from Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in 1997 for the construction of
Inchon International Airport in northern South Korea.  This will be the first
time that skilled foreign workers have been admitted to South Korea by either a
private or public agency.  </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea plans to bring in 3,000 more skilled foreign laborers in 1998
and about 2,000 in 1999 to work on the airport.</tt><p>
<tt>South Korean businesses are struggling to find workers for the 3-D (dirty,
difficult and dangerous) jobs.  Up to 50 percent of an employer's workers can
be industrial trainees.  However, many of the trainees escape from their
employers because they can earn more than trainee wages as illegal
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 170,000 foreign workers in Korea, including 70,000
to 110,000 illegal foreign laborers.</tt><p>
<tt>Korea plans a third crackdown on illegal foreign workers, after two
previous crackdowns resulted in the removal of 8,500 illegal aliens over the
past 12 months.  The crackdown will focus on restaurants and places of
entertainment, not factories, reflecting, an official said, recognition of
labor shortages in manufacturing.</tt><p>
<tt>The national fishing cooperative says there are 53,000 coastal fishing jobs
and only 42,000 Korean fisherman.  The Korea Federation of Textile Industries
cannot fill nearly 15 percent of its jobs, up from 12 percent in 1995.  About
20 percent of heavy manufacturing jobs are vacant at small- and medium-size
businesses.  Some sectors, such as plastics and electrical machinery, are short
30 percent of their desired work force. </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in South Korea complain that the biggest problems for them
are poor living and working conditions, substandard wages and employer abuse.
Koreans managers are notorious for mistreating workers, both at home and in
Korean-owned factories abroad.  </tt><p>
<tt>In August, 1996, a Korean manager of a Korean-owned shoe factory in
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City received a suspended prison sentence for lining up
and beating employees with an unfinished shoe.  Corporal punishment was
accepted in Korean work places until the 1970s.</tt><p>
<tt>The Korean government has announced plans to improve local training
programs for foreigners, cracking down on immigrants who commit crimes and
establishing a new system to track and supervise foreigners throughout their
stay in Korea.  </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea promised to change its labor laws when it joined the OECD in
1996 and became a full member of the ILO in 1991.  A 1963 law limits each work
place to one union, one union per industry and one national union
confederation, the Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), thereby making the activities of
the rival Korean Congress of Trade Unions unlawful.  </tt><p>
<tt>A 1980 law bars non-employee organizers from assisting a plant union and a
third law prevents teachers and civil servants from joining unions.  Hundreds
of union activists are in jail for violating these laws.</tt><p>
<tt>Korean employers complain that rigid labor laws limit their flexibility.
Workers can be dismissed only "for cause" and discharged workers are entitled
to 30 days severance pay per year of service.</tt><p>
<tt>South Korea is a country of 44 million, with a per capita GDP of about
$11,000 in 1996.  Seoul, which is only 30 miles from North Korea, is home to
one-fourth of all South Koreans. </tt><p>

Struggles to Control Foreign

</a></h2>
<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs on November 14, 1996 announced that it was
reducing the maximum percentage of foreign workers in a company or factory from
32 to 35 percent to 30 percent.  There were about 239,000 foreign workers in
Taiwan in August 1996--most from Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia --and 300,000 unemployed Taiwanese.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the Taiwan Labor Front, there may be a total of 450,000
foreign workers in Taiwan, including illegal workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan first admitted foreign workers in 1991 for 3-D jobs--dirty,
dangerous, and difficult--but expanded permission to employ foreign workers in
73 industrial and business categories, as well as six major manufacturing
projects on a case-by-case basis.</tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Health reported on November 15, 1996 that 24,966  foreign
workers, 10 percent of those who legally entered Taiwan, had abandoned their
jobs.  About 15,200 have been caught, which leaves almost 10,000 who have fled
their jobs</tt><p>

<tt>On November 11, 1996, the International Labor Organization released a
report, "Child Labor: Targeting the Intolerable," that estimated that 250
million children ages five to 14 work in developing countries, double previous
estimates.  About 130 million of these children work part time and 120 million
work full time.  About 60 percent of the child laborers are in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, an estimated 42 percent of the children in Kenya worked full or
part time; followed by Bangladesh, 30 percent; Haiti, 25 percent; Turkey, 24
percent; and Pakistan, 17 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO report urged stepped up enforcement and stiffer penalties for three
types of child labor:  child prostitution, slavery and the use of children in
hazardous manufacturing</tt><p>
<tt>On November 1, 1996, Bangladesh agreed to stop using children under 14 in
its 2,000-firm garment industry.  The firms exported $2.5 billion worth of
clothing in 1995-96, 60 percent to the US.  Under the agreement, the 10,500
girls now employed in the garment industry will be sent to school and each
child will receive a stipend of 300 take (US$8) per month.  Businesses caught
using child labor could lose their export licenses.</tt><p>
<tt>Children under 15 are employed in an estimated 300 types of jobs in
Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN on August 10 released a report on slavery throughout the world.  The
report found that more than 55 million Indian children are held in servitude
despite a 20-year old ban on slave labor. </tt><p>
<tt>In Pakistan, the UN found nearly 800 cases of employers convicted for
exploiting child labor.  The Kamiya system in Nepal keeps entire families in
slavery through buying and selling workers.  The UN investigators also found
that Burmese local authorities are using more and more forced labor in rural
areas, infrastructure projects and oil and gas prospecting. </tt><p>
<tt>Most offenses involving foreign workers found employers confiscating an
employee's passport, so that abused immigrants usually did not have residence
or work permits and were dependent upon the employer.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO has proposed a convention to protect foreign seafarers.  The ILO

<tt>The world's population, expected to top 5.8 billion in December 1996, is
growing at about 79 million per year (216,000 per day), reflecting 133 million
births per year (364,000 per day) and 53 million deaths per year (145,000 per
day).  The world's population is projected to reach 6.2 billion in the year
2000 and seven billion in 2010.</tt><p>
<tt>In November, the UN announced that the world's population growth had
unexpectedly slowed to 1.48 percent per year, down from an expected 1.57
percent per year.  Fertility worldwide is now about three children per woman.
If these trends continue, the world's population might be 9.4 rather than 10
billion in 2050.</tt><p>
<tt>By 2025, some five billion people, two-thirds of the world's expected
population of eight billion to nine billion, are expected to be living in
cities.  Many fast-growing cities are in developing countries and are
increasingly populated by young, unemployed men, creating a climate for rising
crime, political violence and the spread of diseases.</tt><p>
<tt>The New York metropolitan area was the world's largest city in 1950 and
third-largest in 1995.  According to UN projections, New York City will drop to
11th place by 2015, behind Tokyo; Bombay, 27 million; Lagos, 24 million;
Shanghai, 24 million; Jakarta, 21 million; Sao Paulo and Karachi.  Beijing,
Dhaka, and Mexico City will have 19 million residents each.</tt><p>
<tt>At a UN meeting in November, both Thailand and Zambia said that illegal
immigration was a major threat to their countries.</tt><p>
<tt>The World Tourism Organization reported that France attracted 61 million
foreign visitors, almost 10 percent of the world's total of 567 million,
followed by Spain and the US, with 45 million each.  The top 10
countries--including Italy, China, UK, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, and
Austria--attracted 54 percent of all foreign tourists.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, worldwide spending on
travel and tourism is projected to be $3.6 trillion in 1996, up from $3.1
trillion in 1992 and $1.9 trillion in 1987.  Travel and tourism employed an
estimated 255 million workers in 1995, up from 130 million workers worldwide in
1992 and 100 million in 1987.</tt><p>

<tt>Bangladesh formally asked Taiwan if it would receive Bangladeshi workers,

Bangladeshis now or in the future. </tt><p>
<tt>About two million Bangladeshis work abroad, including nearly 40 percent in

Bangladeshi's foreign exchange.  Bangladesh began to export workers in
1987.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 25,000 Bangladeshis were returned home from the United Arab
Emirates in September, 1996 and another 8,000 were expected return after the
UAE's extended amnesty for illegal migrant workers expired on October 31, 1996.
Another 100,000 may be expelled from Malaysia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bangladeshi government has offered to export workers to Malaysia, South
Korea, Mauritius, Brunei, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and South Africa.  The
Bangladeshi work force is estimated at 25 million.   </tt><p>
<tt>Bangladeshis also migrate north to Assam, India.  One of the largest day
labor markets is the Indian state of Assam, in Gauhati's Laktakia quarter,
where hundreds of Bangadeshis congregate at rail and bus stations for jobs.
According to local officials, the Bangladeshis go to work on farms or in
construction, build a shelter for themselves and then send for their
families.</tt><p>
<tt>If a Bangladeshi worker can get the Indian employer to provide him with a
work permit, he can use the permit to get a ration card, which signifies that
the bearer is an Indian.  In 1993, the Indian Election Commission struck three
million names of alleged Bangladeshis from the voting rolls in Assam because
they got ration cards in this manner, but a court overturned the action.</tt><p>
<tt>About 35 percent of Assam's residents are believed to be foreigners.  Most
of the "native Assamese" immigrated from Burma in the 1300s and were later
Hinduized by immigrant Brahmans from Bihar and Orissa.  The indigenous
inhabitants of the Brahmaputra Valley are the Bodo tribes, who are opposed to
both the Bengali immigrants and the Assamese.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not clear what the Indian government intends to do about illegal
Bangladeshis.  In 1985, the Assam Accord pledged to remove all Bangladeshis who
had immigrated illegally after 1971.  On January 28, 1983, not far from
Gauhati, thousands of "illegal Bangladeshis" were killed.</tt><p>
<tt>Plans for a 600-mile border fence have not yet been implemented.  The
border police estimate that about one thousand Bangladeshis cross the border
into India each day.</tt><p>
<tt>A new book by Ashok Swain, The Environmental Trap: The Ganges River
Diversion, Bangladeshi Migration and Conflicts in India (1996), argues that
Indian water and environmental policies may be a factor that encourages
Bangladeshi migration to Assam.  Since 1975, India has diverted water from  the
River Ganges at the Farakka Barrage before the water reached the south-western
part of Bangladesh, encouraging some people there to migrate because they did
not have enough water to irrigate their crops.</tt><p>
<tt>There are some 15 million ethnic Indians scattered around the world, more
than a million in each of Burma, South Africa and the US and 700,000 in
Canada.</tt><p>
<tt>Government officials from the state of Kerala, in southern India, report
that the clampdown on foreign workers in the United Arab Emirates, will hit
them hard.  Nearly half of the 50,000 to 60,000 Indians in the UAE are
Malayalees, native from Kerala, and 90 percent are unskilled or semi-skilled
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the run-up to Indian elections, sketches of life in rural India
emphasized that moneylenders and local power brokers still maintain an iron
grip on the countryside, where most Indians live.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC31">Foreign
Workers in the Middle East</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>About 40 percent of the population of the six Gulf nations are foreigners
and their per capita incomes, including foreign residents, have fallen sharply.
In Saudi Arabia, for example, per capita income has fallen from $19,000 in 1980
to about $7,000 in 1995, below the World Bank's line for rich countries
($7620).</tt><p>
<tt><u>Jordan.</u>  The Jordanian government is considering deporting 300,000
guest workers to reduce unemployment.  Unemployment estimates range from 15
percent to 25 percent of the 900,000 work force.  There are currently about
400,000 foreign workers in Jordan, three-fourths of whom are Egyptians.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one proposal, medicine, engineering and administrative and
secretarial positions would be closed to foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Analysts say that most competition for employment between foreign workers
and Jordanians is in low-paying jobs.  A proposed minimum wage for Jordanian
workers might, analysts say, make employers favor foreign workers for
low-paying jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>UAE.</u>  Water and power demand in the United Arab Emirates fell 10 to
15 percent since nearly 200,000 illegal foreign workers left the country,
according to government sources.  Water and electricity are heavily subsidized
in the UAE, which has 2.4 million residents.  About two-thirds of the
population, and 90 percent of the work force, are foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants leaving the UAE range from
167,000 to 200,000.  Reports from the UAE say that taxis are difficult to find
and hiring a maid is almost impossible.  Work at several construction sites has
stopped.  Most of the workers who left were construction workers and service
workers in restaurants, shops and some factories.  </tt><p>
<tt>One bank official predicted that there may be a slight decline in real
growth through the rest of the year because of the departure of the foreign
workers.  One effect of the exodus has been to have illegal part-time workers
take on full-time jobs.  Employers must pay taxes on full-time employees and
provide housing. </tt><p>
<tt><u>Saudi Arabia.</u>  Saudi Arabia continues its effort to intervene in
both the demand and supply side of the labor market, denying employers
permission to import e.g. secretaries, and offering young Saudis courses in how
to be better workers.  There are about three million Saudi workers and five
million foreign workers in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The Saudi 1995-2000 plan calls for the creation of 650,000 jobs for Saudis,
with 300,000 created by having Saudis replacing foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia's per capita income fell from about $18,000 per year in the
early 1980s to $6,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Kuwait.</u> The 1.2 million foreign workers  and their families in
Kuwait are about 63 percent Kuwait's 1.9 million residents.  Since 1991, 440
foreigners were found to be HIV positive and immediately deported.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Israel. </u> Israel in November set up a camp near Tel Aviv to hold some
of the 200,000 illegal aliens in the country that it apprehends.  The camp, a
former prison annex, can accommodate 90 immigrants.  Israel plans to deport
2,000 illegal immigrants each month, up from 1996 level of 150 per
month.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the foreign workers are from Romania, Thailand, the Philippines and
African countries.  Many overstay their visas rather than return to a life of
poverty in their native lands.  At one Tel Aviv school, half the pupils are
children of foreign workers illegally living in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The 250,000 foreign workers in Israel enter into some 3,000 fictitious
marriages each year, the Interior Ministry estimates.  Israeli women typically
receive NIS 2000 to marry a foreigner.</tt><p>
<tt>Israel will ask Thailand for 4,000 additional workers to pick fruit for
export to Japan.</tt><p>
<tt>In Palestine, the labor force is about 433,000 with unemployment estimated
to be over 50 percent.  About 18,000 Palestinians work in Israel, down from
116,000 in 1992.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC33">The
Atlantic:  Can the US afford immigration?</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The November 1996 Atlantic includes two immigration articles.  Historian
David M. Kennedy asks "Can We Still Afford to Be a Nation of Immigrants?" and
economist George Borjas discusses "The New Economics of Immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy begins by noting that two extremes have framed US views of
immigrants.  On the one hand, immigrants have been often praised for being the
best of their societies, the risk-takers attracted to the US by opportunity and
freedom.  The other extreme, common at the beginning of the 20th century, is
that immigrants are inferior to US-born residents--supply-push factors such as
overpopulation and joblessness push them toward the US.  Both views see
immigrants as individuals choosing where to live.</tt><p>
<tt>Two supply-push factors in Europe, says Kennedy, were responsible for mass
US immigration in the 19th century--population growth--Europe's population
doubled from 200 million to 400 million in the 1800s, even after 70 million
people emigrated--and the agricultural and industrial revolutions that
displaced rural and urban peoples.</tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy then turns to three factors that he thinks helped to integrate
immigrants in the US; their relatively low numbers, rapid economic growth, and
the varied composition and broad dispersal of the immigrants throughout the US.
The 15 percent foreign-born persons enumerated in the 1910 Census were less
than the 18 percent foreign-born in Australia, or the 20 percent foreign-born
in Canada, or the even higher percentage of foreign born in Argentina at the
turn of the century.  According to Kennedy, the diversity of immigrants meant
that no group could forever maintain its cultural identity and none could gain
political power over more than a city.</tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy argues that the same two supply-push factors--population growth and
economic change--are pushing migrants from Mexico and other countries to the US
at the end of the 20th century.  Kennedy asserts that the US can absorb the
number of immigrants arriving.  However, Kennedy says that unskilled immigrants
do not have the same economic payoff for US natives that they did a century
ago. </tt><p>
<tt>Kennedy then turns to Mexico, the source of about one-fourth of US
immigrants over the past 15 years.  He notes that the Hispanicization of the
American Southwest is sometimes called the Reconquista and goes on to speculate
that the prospect of continuing migration from a neighboring country is
unprecedented and that it is far from clear whether geographic proximity will
serve to speed integration or isolation.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas says that immigration policies can be compared by how they
resolve two fundamental questions: how many immigrants the country should admit
and what kinds of people they should be.  According to Borjas, there is now a
consensus that:</tt><p>
<tt>1.  The relative education or skills of successive immigrant waves have
declined over much of the postwar period, i.e., the gap between the average
years of schooling of native-born adults and recent immigrants has widened from
about 0.4 years to 1.3 years.</tt><p>
<tt>2.  Many recent immigrants will never earn as much as similar US-born
residents and, as they crowd into the low wage labor market, immigration may
account for as much as one-third of the drop in the wages of unskilled US
workers.  The net economic benefits to the US from immigration are about $7
billion per year, according to Borjas, about what the US spends on the Interior
Department, or $30 per person per year.</tt><p>
<tt>3.  Households headed by recent immigrants are more likely to receive some
type of welfare assistance than households headed by US-born persons.
Unskilled immigrants are likely to have children who also have below average
levels of schooling.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas goes on to divide the world's people into three groups--natives,
immigrants and the persons left behind, and asks how immigration affects the
size of the economy after immigrants enter and the distribution of income.
Immigration slows wage increases, but increase the size of the economy; a 10
percent increase in the labor force is associated with a three percent drop in
wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas agrees with Briggs and many other economists that the number of
immigrants admitted annually should be linked to conditions in the US
economy.</tt><p>
<tt>Furthermore, Borjas suggests several immigration policy goals and ways to
achieve them.  If the goal of immigration policy is to increase the per capita
income of the native population, then immigration policy should encourage the
entry of skilled workers.</tt><p>
