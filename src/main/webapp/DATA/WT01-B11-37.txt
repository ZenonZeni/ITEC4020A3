<H1> Engine Seals </H1>

<P> As early as 1924 <A HREF = "dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A>
realized that sealing would be one of the biggest problems in developing
a rotary combustion engine.  In the late 20's and early 30's he made
many experiments.  His research in this field allowed him to make
several advances.  These led to contracts with BMW and other companies.

<P> There are two kinds of areas on the rotor that need sealing: the
apices (plural of apex) and the sides.  The peripheral housings are
actually slightly larger than a true epitrochoid.  This is done to
improve sealing by preventing unnecessary seal movement.

<P> Before 1986, the apex seals had two pieces, one of which is a small
triangle.  Since 1986, the long piece was split along its length
horizontally so now the apex seal is composed of three pieces.  The
thickness was reduced from 3 mm to 2 mm.  These seals are backed with a
single spring bar before 1986 and two spring bars from 1986 on.

<P> The material is cast iron alloy.  The top rubbing surface is
chill hardened by an electron beam.

<P> The side seals are 1.0 mm before 1986 and 0.7 mm there-after.  They
are made of sintered iron.  This provides some self-lubrication as it
rubs against the nitrided iron surface of the side housing.

<P> Water seals are used between the peripheral and side housings [<A
HREF = "glossary.html#housing">gloss</A>].  In 1986 the grooves in which
they fit were moved from the peripheral to the side housing.
