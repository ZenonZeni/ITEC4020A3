<P><B>Fort Myers Beach, FL</B> (September 11, 1996): Walt Weisel, President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, relates how a recent customer saved hundreds of man hours and capital expenditure as a result of the use of simulation in robot cell layout.</P>
<P>"We were really an afterthought to the customers project plans for a large computer supplier." states Walt Weisel, President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc.(RWT). RWT is the exclusive North American distributor of Workspace&reg;, the world's first PC based robot simulation and off-line programming software package developed by Robotic Simulations, Ltd. of the UK. "The integrator gave us the project to model as a challenge to evaluate Workspace&reg;. Using their 2D CAD drawings and rough layout plans, we modeled the cell in Workspace&reg; and created a 3D animation that told them more than they were expecting to find. They had already purchased the robot and were building enclosures based on the 2D drawings and rough modeling in their shop. Which is a fairly standard practice in the industry for companies not using simulation."</P>

<p>One of the first comments we got from their design team was that we were asking them questions about components of the cell they normally would not have researched until they were in the final phases of  build-up. So not only did we create a proactive approach to the design and layout, we later discovered several things that would have cost thousands more than the initial purchase of the software. We met with the customer at their facility with the robot setting in the back room awaiting the cell build-up.</p>

<p>"The first thing we proved through the simulation was the robot could not reach all of the fixtures it needed to. In a 2D CAD drawing it looked feasible, but when you add in the true reach of the robot model, they were coming up short. This was coupled with major collisions in the cycle that would have destroyed the fixtures and the controller monitor. They had also realized the cycle time shown in simulation was 30 seconds over contract time. Even under perfect cycle simulations, they were not going to make their goal and the goal their customer was expecting under contract. All in all, they would have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars including their reputation."</p>

<p>"With the simulation in hand, they were able to quickly redesign the cell, reposition the robot, change fixtures and redevelop the entire process with the customer to achieve cycle times and actually exceed the customer's expectations. The ability of Workspace&reg; to run on their notebook computer and they could easily take the simulation right to the customers desk, allowed them to graphically show the story and sell the customer without lengthy delays while they deciphered drawings and made their own calculations. They were also able to leave a copy of the simulation for the customer to run on their own PC, using the animation player feature of Workspace&reg;, the customer only needed to have a PC running Windows 3.11."</p>

<p>"This is just one of the success stories we have shared with customers and Workspace&reg;." adds Walt. We
 have such an affordable alternative to the expensive UNIX- based systems that do not have the portability and versatility this program has to offer. For off-line programming, this system is without comparison in it's seamless, native language code writing for over 174 models of robots using 22 different languages. We also have connectivity capabilities only available with a PC based system. We are bringing true, open-architecture to robot users who have been held hostage to antiquated technology."</p>
