<H2>Hope For Those Who Require Long-Term Care?
The Forgotten Population</H2>
 
by Rose Marie Friedrich and Curtis B. Flory
<HR>			

There is growing evidence that there is a subgroup of persons with severe 
brain disorders (mental illnesses) whose symptoms are largely untouched by 
current treatment or rehabilitation efforts and who may require long-term 
supervised living arrangements.  The term "the forgotten population" seems 
appropriate for this group because their needs are often overlooked in the 
closure of hospitals and the planning and implementation of community 
services.  These individuals can be found in jails and prisons, among the 
homeless, in nursing homes and care facilities, and even in family homes.  
They remain largely hidden from view and forgotten.
<p>
Although the exact number of individuals who are the most severely affected by deinstitutionalization and inadequate community resources for long-term care is unknown, a preliminary sense of this population follows:
<p>
Diagnosis of schizophrenia

<UL>
<LI>Persons with schizophrenia are the severely mentally ill group most at risk for chronicity and severity of symptoms.  Because of lack of adequate community services they are often homeless, imprisoned and in nursing homes.

<LI>Approximately 40 percent of persons with schizophrenia do not respond well to current treatment.  This is equal to approximately 720,000 persons.

<LI>Seventy-four percent of neuroleptic-responsive outpatients become noncompliant within two years.  The consequence of noncompliance accounts for at least 40 percent of all episodes of schizophrenia relapse and at least one-third of all acute inpatient costs.
</UL>

<p>
Diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder

<UL>
<LI>Approximately 20 percent of persons with bipolar affective disorder do not respond well to current treatment.  This is equal to approximately 220,000 persons.

<LI>Although the majority of persons with this disorder lead essentially normal lives, they too are among those in nursing homes and imprisoned as a result of inadequate community resources.
</UL>


<p>
Concurrent alcoholism/substance abuse
<P>
An estimated 50 percent to 60 percent of brain-disordered inpatients have co-existing alcoholism or substance abuse.

<p>
Concurrent chronic medical diagnosis
<P>
Impairments of daily living are often compounded by physical incapacities among persons with severe brain disorders.  Chronic brain disorders frequently go undiagnosed and untreated.  Little health-services research has been done in this area.
<p>
Deinstitutionalization has severely reduced access to inpatient care that extends beyond a few weeks' time.  The magnitude of deinstitutionalization is evidenced by the following:

<UL>
<LI>The average daily census of state psychiatric hospitals dropped from 559,000 in 1955 to 92,000 in 1990, an 83.5 percent decrease.

<LI>The availability of psychiatric beds has been reduced from 11 per 100,000 in 1986 to 5.2 per 100,000 in 1990 in spite of the concurrent reduction in availability of state hospital capacity.

<LI>The average length of stay in hospitals has been dramatically reduced.  From 1969 to 1988 the average stay in private hospitals went from 39 days to 26 days--a reduction of 33 percent.  Since 1988 there have been further drastic reductions in length of stay in psychiatric units in private and general hospitals.
</UL>

<p>
Community resources have failed to compensate for the decline in hospital care.  In many cases, resources are not available to meet basic human needs (shelter, food, and medical care).  Rehabilitation services are largely unavailable, leaving persons with little or no ongoing care.  This failure has resulted in:
<UL>
<LI>Jailed severely mentally ill:  At least 30,700 severely mentally ill are in jail, and approximately twice that number are in prison.  Schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder are the major diagnoses of those incarcerated.

<LI>Homeless severely mentally ill:  One third of 600,000 homeless suffer from severe brain disorders.  Schizophrenia is common among the long-term homeless.

<LI>Nursing homes:  Approximately 194,300 persons with severe brain disorders live in nursing homes.  Of those, 27 percent (52,451) are under 65 years of age.  Nursing homes house large numbers of individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.

<LI>Household population:  As many as two-thirds of persons with severe brain disorders live with their families, who often become service providers by default because of the gaps in existing mental health services.  The impact on families is enormous, leading to physical illnesses and severe psychological stress among family members.

<LI>Group homes:  Of particular concern is the limited number of group homes.  Only 32,328 live in this setting.  In spite of positive outcomes from a structured environment for those who are the most severely ill, there is a growing movement to locate this population in independent living arrangements with limited support.

<LI>Suicides:  Suicide is an increasingly common outcome of failed deinstitutionalization and lack of adequate community services.  About 10 percent of those with schizophrenia and 15 percent of those with mood disorders commit suicide.  This is in contrast to the rate of 1 percent for the general population.

<LI>Rehospitalizations:  The rate of rehospitalizations is increasing, with many readmitted 20 to 30 times.
