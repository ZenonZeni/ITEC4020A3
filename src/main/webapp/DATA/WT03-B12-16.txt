GOVERNMENT TIES TELSTRA TO DIGITALISATION TIMETABLE

Communications minister Michael Lee released on 17 January
details of network development undertakings negotiated with
Telstra which commit the carrier to six monthly milestones leading to
full digitisation of the network by 30 June 2000. The government
made a commitment to negotiating this network development deed
in September 1994, as a result of issues raised by the Casualties of
Telstra cases.

It commits Telstra to having 73.9 percent of lines in urban areas and
63.9 percent of rural lines digital by 30 June 1996. The number of
rural lines served by old ARK exchanges is to be reduced to 3.4
percent by the same date.

Calling line identification is to be available on all exchanges by 30
June 1997. CLI availability in rural areas is currently 89.8 percent
and in urban areas almost 100 percent.

Carrier preselection and itemised billing are to be available to all
customers by 30 June 1997, in time for the new competition regime
on 1 July 1997. Preselection availability is already a requirement of
Telstra's licence but the new undertakings provide a timetable to its
achievement. Preselection and itemised billing is available to
almost all urban users and will be available to 89.4 percent of rural
customers by mid 1996.

Telstra's compliance with its undertakings will be monitored by the
Department of Communications and the Arts in conjunction with
Austel and details will be tabled in Parliament.

On 28 November the Democrats communications spokesperson,
Senator Vicki Bourne, asked Senator Bob Collins, minister
representing the minister for communications and the arts, when the
government expected to release this network development deed of
agreement and why it had been delayed for over a year. Collins
concluded a long and rather vague answer by saying that "a
number of complex issues and detailed considerations have
needed to be dealt with in developing the undertakings. This has
been taking place in a rapidly changing environment that Telstra is
operating in which does have consequences for its business
strategies". According to Bourne's office he promised the deed
would be released "next week (ie early December). However the
Hansard record had it as "next month".

TELSTRA'S DISTRIBUTOR AND TARIFF PLANS FALL FOUL OF
AUSTEL

Tariff changes announced by Telstra early in December which
would have made non-value adding resale of basic telephone
service unviable have been blocked by Austel pending a detailed
investigation.

On 1 December Telstra announced its intention to withdraw the
Multisite Plan 1 (MSP1) and Callsaver 3 (CS3) tariffs. These had
been designed for large corporate users but formed the backbone
of many simple resellers' businesses and Telstra claimed this was
not commercially sustainable. Value adding resellers were offered
revised Service Provider 1 (SP1) and Service Provider 2 (SP2)
tariffs which Telstra claimed did not disadvantage genuine value
adding resellers. Callsaver 4 (CS4) and Callsaver 8 (CS8) tariffs
were also restructured.

The announcement provoked a strong reaction from the Service
Providers Action Network (Span) which, at a strategy meeting on 11
December, set up a fighting fund with $1000 from each member and
formed four committees to pursue its case: at the ministerial level,
with Austel, with the carriers and with the ACCC and on legal
grounds.

Austel announced on 22 December its initial decisions on the
filings. SP1, SP2 and the Freecall Flexiplan were disallowed.
Corporate Virtual Private Network (CVPN), CS4 and CS8, Business
Saver Plus, Corporate Centre Local and Long Distance tariffs were
not disallowed but without prejudice to subsequent Austel reviews.

On 9 January Austel chairman Neil Tuckwell wrote to Span saying it
had conducted a preliminary investigation of the CS8 tariff and the
result suggested that CS8 may be anticompetitive. It requested
submissions from Span members by 16 January to help it finalise its
determination.

Austel diasallowed SP1 because it bundled local and long distance
calls for discount purposes in a way which was not subject to
competition. It also offered no additional discount on local calls to
the retail CS10 tariff even though the SP1 user was required to take
responsibility for billing and bad debts. Austel also noted that SP1
discriminated against switched service providers, the entities most
likely to become competing carriers after July 1997.

Austel also expressed concern at the bundling of national and
international long distance services, fixed to mobile, 1800, 13 and
calling card services under CS4 and CS8 and said it would
examine these bundlings pursuant to clause 238A of the
Telecommunications Act.

Austel has also made a number of comments and
recommendations to Telstra and said it would pursue these matters
with Telstra early in 1996.

These include:

- recommending to Telstra that it give service providers reasonable
time to make adjustments to their businesses needed as a result of
future tariff changes, and that it should not use the intervening
period to compete unfairly.

- encouraging Telstra to develop a range of service provider
products which meet government policy objectives and the
requirements of service providers.

- encouraging Telstra to consider a wide area egress product for
switched operators "since there appears to be no operational
restrictions to this".

Span chairman Brian Perkins, in a letter to members on 22
December described the decision as "a great Christmas present
thanks to Santa Austel".

DRAFT TELECOMMS LEGISLATION RELEASED

The Department of Communications and the Arts made good on its
promise to deliver a draft of the post 1997 telecommunications
legislation, releasing it on 20 December as the Telecommunications
Bill (1996) and the Trade Practices Amendment
(Telecommunications) Bill 1996. The issued 148 page document
comprises the draft bills and commentary on each of them.

The drafts were based on 99 post 1997 proposals released on 1
August (Exc August 4, 1995). A new policy proposal provides for a
further full review of all telecommunications regulation "to be
completed in time for implementation in 2000".

The government also announced plans for technical self regulation
of the industry and simultaneously released an additional 38
proposals setting out its policy intentions (see below).
Communications minister Michael Lee said the new policy would
"align (Australia) more closely with international approaches to
technical regulation of telecommunications".

Not all provisions of the initial 99 proposals have been dealt with in
the draft legislation. It concentrates on licencing of carriers, codes of
practice, anticompetitive conduct and the access regime, saying
these are "likely to be the areas of most concern to industry and
where the earliest prior notification to industry is required to enable
preparation for further competition and self regulation".

The new Telecommunications Bill will remove almost all barriers to
entry into all telecommunications services but will limit the market
power of the incumbents by instituting access codes under which
they will be obliged to make their networks available to competitors.

The name Austel will be retained as the abbreviation for the
Australian Telecommunications and Spectrum Management
Agency which will be formed by merging the present Austel and the
Spectrum Management Agency. The SMA's responsibilities for
administering the Radio Communications Act 1992 will be taken
over largely unchanged by the new Austel. Telecommunications
competition policy responsibility will be transferred to the ACCC.
The new Austel will be responsible for carrier licensing, codes of
practice, assisting carriers to fulfil universal service obligations and
for oversight of technical regulation.

The Trade Practices (Telecommunications) Amendments Bill
includes a new part XIC of the Trade Practices Act which will
replace Part 8 (access by carriers to networks and services of other
carriers) and other relevant provisions of the Telecommunications
Act 1991. It also sets out a new part XIB of the TPC replacing part 9
(supply of basic carriage services by carriers) of the
Telecommunications Act 1991 to govern anticompetitive carrier
conduct .

Carriers will be required to join the Telecommunications Access
Forum (TAF) which will be required to produce a code of conduct for
access to carriers' facilities and resolution of disputes. The ACCC
will have a reserve power to override the TAF code.

However the draft bill has not fully defined the term access,
because, according to the commentary "the concept of access
covers a diverse range of things (such as) access to land, to
physical infrastructure, computer systems, billing services and
information, directory assistance and databases. Submissions are
invited on whether the legislation should include a precise definition
of the term access.

Separate legislative provisions will apply to service providers and
carriers. Anyone will be able to become a service provider but may
be declared a carrier by the ACCC against criteria set out in the
telecommunications bill. Any service provider with substantial
control over customers through its own switches is likely to be
declared a carrier, even if it does not own any transmission
infrastructure.

A carrier will be required to give undertakings to provide access to
its services and facilities in accordance with codes and standards.

As expected, pivotal to the new act is the distinction between
service provider and carrier. Carrier status is something that service
providers are likely to avoid rather than seek because it confers
considerable responsibilities and few benefits. Commentary to the
draft bill details the distinctions and the decision making process in
some detail.

A service provider will be anyone who supplies what is known in the
present Act as a telecommunications service, but has been
renamed a 'carriage service', or who uses a carriage service to
supply an online entertainment of information service.

A carrier will be someone who controls access to a network, ie can
prevent service providers from using that component for the
purposes of providing services".

The legislation also introduces the concept of a person's 'immediate
circle' to exclude what have been traditionally private networks from
being assigned carrier status. The term 'immediate circle' includes
state and federal government bodies, employees of business and
corporations and corporations related to another corporation "within
the meaning of the Corporations Law".

There is also a three dimensional geographic test applied to
communications networks. A point, whether fixed or mobile, is on a
network within Australia if it is on Australian territory, or in the
atmosphere below the stratosphere. Any point on a satellite and
above the stratosphere is outside Australia. The stratosphere
extends only to a height of 50 kms so all points on planned low
earth orbit satellites would be outside Australia.

The draft bills are open for comment until 16 February 1996.

TELECOMMS INDUSTRY TO BE SELF REGULATING

The government has proposed a regime of industry self regulation
of the technical aspects of communications and has issued an
addition 38 policy proposals setting out the new regime.

The additional proposals seek to harmonise technical regulation of
radio communications and telecommunications and minimise
government control over technical regulation which will be
"primarily addressed through industry self regulation involving
affected groups including consumers".

Interconnect standards will be developed by carriers and service
providers in conjunction with the Telecommunications Access
Forum.

Customer equipment and cabling standards will be industry
developed but "taking into account Austel/SMA's views on health
and safety aspects and on matters concerning the integrity of
telecommunications networks".

Carriers and service providers will be required to report on their
quality of service and performance against a code of practice
developed by the industry and registered with Austel.

Responsibility for accrediting conformance testing laboratories will
be transferred from Austel to a competent accreditation body such
as the National Association of Testing Authorities (Nata).

However Austel/SMA will have a reserve power to mandate
standards where appropriate or where self regulation fails.

Standards will be required to be based on international and
regional standards unless this is inappropriate. Carriers and service
providers will be free to develop their own network standards but
these must be co-ordinated with interconnection, customer
equipment and cabling standards.

The controversial Telecommunications National Code under which
the existing carriers enjoy protection from state and local
government planning requirements will be reviewed and carriers
will cease to have power to override planning rules.

TELSTRA OFFERS RADICAL SOLUTION TO USO PROBLEM

In the height of the traditional media 'silly season' (between
Christmas and New Year), major papers carried stories of a radical
proposal by Telstra to revamp the universal service obligation
(USO) scheme.

Telstra's proposals were submitted in November to the House of
Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and
Public Administration which was conducting an enquiry into aspects
of the national competition policy reform package. The terms of
reference for the enquiry included the impact of these reforms on
the efficient delivery of community service obligations.

Telstra's preferred option was for a radical reform under which
forward looking multi year 'contracts' for the provision of USOs
would be negotiated between a USO carrier and the relevant
government contracting agency. "The agency should be able to call
for expressions of interest in particular services in specified
geographic areas or markets after considering supply options,
demand for service and other market conditions...If the expression
of interest process indicated alternative supply options a
competitive tendering process would follow to determine the cost of
the USO (this) should be preferred as the most transparent
mechanism and the best means of encouraging efficiency in
delivery".

Telstra suggests that it should remain the carrier of last resort and,
failing the emergence of viable alternatives as a result of the tender,
the agency would enter into direct negotiations to produce an
explicit contract for the provision of services. Telstra recommends
that USO continue to be funded by a levy on other carriers.

The story was short-lived. The following day, communications
minister Michael Lee, in a radio interview, committed the
government to the present USO policy. Opposition communications
spokesman Richard Alston, normally very quick to fire off a press
release critical of any pronouncement by Lee, was also silent. The
issue is sensitive with rural communities and neither side wants to
risk upsetting rural voters in the run up to an election.

However in addition to the radical reforms highlighted in press
coverage, Telstra's 50 page submission to the enquiry listed a
number of issues which it said would need to be resolved if the
government preferred minimal reforms to the USO scheme. These
included:

- That the system creates market distortions which impact on service
pricing and delivery and which could hinder development of
competitive markets.

- That the USO system does not foster improvements in delivery of
services to rural areas and "there is very little incentive for other
carriers to examine alternative means of providing the USO".

- That the USO system does not recognise all Telstra's costs, there
are not direct links between carrier investment decisions and the
USO system thus limiting incentives for carriers to invest in USOs.

- Because auditors will not sign off on the contentious USO cost
modelling process Austel is required to finalise the cost "in
effect...audit the unauditable".

- Payments of USO contributions to Telstra have been delayed
because the system does not lead to timely closure of the costing
process. Telstra says it is working with Austel to improve the costing
process, but also calls for a dispute resolution process to enable it
to receive payment from other carriers more promptly.

Telstra also proposes a mechanism for evolving the definition of
USO in line with the growth of new services in other markets. It
submits that a service should be subject to USO provisions only
after it has become "widely used and socially significant in a freely
operating competitive market".

Even where an extension to the USO is merited on this test Telstra
argues that there should also be a formal evaluation of the
alternative uses to which the community's resources might be put if
the USO changes did not proceed.

FOXTEL/AUSTRALIS MERGER UNDER ACCC SCRUTINY

Australis and Foxtel hoped to close 1995 with the way clear to
completing the merger announced in September. However delays
in preparing the documentation for the deal and, more importantly,
the close scrutiny to which it has been subjected by the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) leave the future of
the merger in the balance with legal action threatened if the ACCC
does veto it.

When the deal was announced the two companies said they
expected to put it to a meeting of Australis shareholders in
December and the ACCC had also initially indicated it would reach
a decision before Christmas.

A key factor in the ACCC's decision making process is whether it
decides that pay TV is a separate market or whether pay TV and
free-to-air TV should be considered as a single market. Optus
Vision has also argued that the merger would lessen competition in
the market for local telephony even though Telstra (50 percent
owner of Foxtel) has given no indication of plans to use the Foxtel
network for telephony and continues to cast doubts on Optus'
announced intention of offering telephony on its network in 1996
(Exc December1, 1995).

COUNCILS SCORE FIRST VICTORY AGAINST OPTUS CABLE
ROLLOUT

City councils opposing the installation of Optus Vision's cable TV
network from power poles in residential streets scored their first
victory with the Supreme Court in Victoria on 21 December granting
the council of Boroondara an injunction restraining Optus Vision
from further installations in the area until the case can be heard in
full.

Judge Barry Beach found that Optus had a serious case to answer
on possible breaches of the Telecommunications National Code
and also found that the exemptions granted by the
Telecommunications Act 1991 were so wide as to create
widespread uncertainty on their application. Council lawyers had
earlier argued that the code could even be used to exempt Optus
employees from road speed limits.

In NSW 16 councils are now participating in a joint action against
Optus Vision. Their application for an injunction will be heard on 12
March.

TELSTRA AND OPTUS TO LOSE PLANNING EXEMPTIONS

Telstra and Optus Communications will lose their exemptions from
state and local government planning regulations after July 1997. In
a statement issued on 20 December communications minister
Michael Lee said it would be wrong to allow an unlimited number of
telephone companies to be exempt from planning laws.

Austel's report on the Telecommunications National Code which
governs the carriers' conduct of their exempt operations was due to
be received by the minister at the end of 1995 and will be released
early in 1996.

The minister's statement gave no indication of any changes to the
code before July 1997 but with local government action against
Optus Vision's overhead cables starting to bite (see story above)
commentators have said that the minister should act sooner in order
to prevent Optus from being disadvantaged against Telstra's
unimpeded underground cable rollout programme.

Under the present legislation the planning exemption is conferred
by the Telecommunications Act 1991 with carriers required to
exercise their exemption in accordance with the National
Telecommunications Code. In the new legislation, clause 2207 of
the draft Telecommunications Bill 1996 ensures that all carriers will
have to fully comply with state and territory planning laws. It states
that "A power conferred by this Act must not be exercised in such a
way as to prevent the exercise of the powers or the performance of
the functions of government of a State, the Northern Territory, the
Australian Capital Territory or Norfolk Island".

This approach has also been criticisedby ATUG because it would
give local councils control over nationally important infrastructure.

JNA AND AUSDOC FORM MESSAGING JOINT VENTURE

Listed Australian companies JNA Telecommunications and Ausdoc
Pty Ltd have announced the formation of a joint venture company to
develop and deliver electronic messaging services. JNA will initially
take about 60 percent equity in the company which will be formed
from Ausdoc's recently established electronic messaging business
EDX.

The technical platform underpinning the EDX service was
developed by Ausdoc in conjunction with Digital Equipment
Corporation. According to EDX's chief executive Bob White, Ausdoc
has "an exclusive and perpetual licence to use the technology" with
Digital receiving royalties. JNA will merge the electronic messaging
resources of its Network Services division with EDX, to bring
"experience, products and technical strength" to the joint venture.

The two companies say they are looking for an additional investor
which could either be an institutional investor or value adding
partner. They aim to hold 40 percent equity each, with the new
partner taking 20 percent. Further down the track the two partners
say they plan to explore export markets for the service.

JNA became involved with Ausdoc initially by providing technical
and consulting services in Canberra. According to Ausdoc
managing director, Peter Reilly, the company identified a need for a
partner with expertise in electronic messaging which it lacked and
the joint venture evolved.

Ausdoc operates the DX document exchange service widely used
throughout the legal profession. It had $85 million sales in 1995 and
employs 780 staff and 250 contract owner drivers. It has two major
clients for its recently established EDX business: The South
Australian Courts Administration Authority and the Queensland
Government. The Queensland Government service is provided by
EDX under contract to Pacific Star Communications' subsidiary,
Sunnet Pty Ltd. It will link around 40,000 Government department
and agency users over the next three years via an X.400 backbone
linking existing mainframe and LAN based email systems. The
system is seen as critical to the success of EDX. It is estimated to
require about $2.5 million in capital funding before becoming
cashflow positive in 1996/97.

According to Reilly, EDX is able to offer a more focussed approach
to the electronic messaging needs of clients than competitors such
as AT&T and Telstra because large carriers lack the focus on
messaging which is only a small component of their business. The
company sees creation of communities of interest as a key to
success and aims to make services affordable and accessible for
small members of such communities, charging fixed usage fees
rather than per message charges and tailoring its service to the
specific needs of each community.

SPECTRUM NETWORKS ACQUIRES RESELLER, CONFIRMS
SWITCH PLANS

Spectrum Network Systems Ltd has announced plans to acquire,
subject to due diligence, the fixed network resale business of
Australian Wholesale Communications Pty Ltd (AWC), based in
Melbourne. Spectrum will pay approximately $1.5 million for AWC's
30,000 customers with total annual billings of $A50 million.

AWC will continue to act as Spectrum's exclusive agent for three
years and will provide Spectrum with administrative and
management services at a rate of approximately $130,000 per
month. According to Spectrum, AWC's customer base includes
"nine key trade organisations" and there are "further prospects for
significant billings and sales growth".

Spectrum also confirmed plans for the installation of its own
switched network "initially along the east coast of Australia".

The acquisition is likely to be only one of many which will rationalise
the service provider industry and in particular eliminate
organisations which add little value to the basic service. Spectrum
appears well placed to absorb these organisations because it has
installed a sophisticated billing system obtained from its strategic
partner in the US, the inter-exchange carrier Capital Network
Systems Inc (Exchange November 3, 1995). During December it
was promoting its billing service for other service providers with
large press advertisements.

EXPORT EFFORTS PUT STANILITE INTO THE RED

Listed telecommunications company Stanilite Pacific Limited
became the subject of takeover speculation at the end of the year in
the wake of reporting on 16 December that it was projecting a $11.7
million loss for the half year to 31 December 1995.

The company advised the Stock Exchange that it had revised down
its October 1995 prediction of $75 million first half revenues to $30
million, mostly as a result of delays in finalising export contracts in
North Asia, Europe, the Pacific and Middle East. Delays in issuing
licences in India have also delayed an anticipated $6.5 million in
revenue into the second half of this financial year. Difficulties in
Russia with telecommunications infrastructure have led to the loss
of an anticipated $10 million in follow on orders.

The company retrenched 86 'non-essential' staff in November (Exc
November 24, 1995) following a restructuring into three separate
divisions (Exc November 3, 1995). In spite of its problems Stanilite
says it will continue with its major R&D programmes and is pursuing
two R&D syndication projects. An $11.6 million rights issue to
shareholders made in November 1995 closed with all but 6.3
percent of the shares being taken up by existing shareholders.

COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES CLUSTER FOR SYNERGY

Ausindustry announced on 20 December its support for a coalition
of Australian communications manufacturers formed to exploit
synergies between them. Communications Cluster of Australia Pty
Ltd (CCA) is a joint venture comprising Mitec, Stanilite, Scitec, TCG
Computer Aided Engineering Pty Ltd and Techcom Ltd.

The company has been in operation informally for three years but
with assistance from Ausindustry network broker Anthony Jarrett,
managing director of Mitchellsearch, has increased the scope of its
operations.

Jarrett said a marketing plan had been developed to promote the
cluster as "a single source, diverse capability one stop shop for
large and small customers, here and overseas...Indications from
their informal networking in the past suggest that CCA can produce
growth for each of its members beyond their individual capabilities".

Associated organisations include: Telstra, the TCG Group, the
Radiophysics Division of the CSIRO, Swiss Banking Corporation, R
Barel and Associates (accountants) and Creative Planning Centre
Pty Ltd (business planners).

In December, Exchange reported plans to form another
communications industry network under Ausindustry auspices.
Details of the network, Baltel are to be announced later this year
(Exc December 15, 1995).

WA DEMANDS MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY

According to a report in the West Australian last month (19
December) the West Australian government has specified that
number portability between carriers for mobile services will be
mandatory. The government has called tenders for provision of
mobile services through its telecommunications manager,
Commswest.

Austel said last year, in its report on number portability, that it was
committed to having portability available for digital mobile, 1800, 13
and 1300, 1900, 1901 and 1902 numbers by July 1997 (Exc July
28, 1995) but statements made by communications minister Michael
Lee in answer to Parliamentary questions later in the year did not
confirm this commitment (Exc December 8, 1995).

* In the UK the telecommunications industry has welcomed a report
by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which says that
number portability is necessary for a competitive telephone market
and that BT and other operators should split the cost 70/30.
According to Telecomeuropa's Communications Newsletter, BT had
earlier rejected an Oftel ruling that it should bear the full cost of
implementing portability. According to TCN, BT has been
conducting portability trials since mid 1995 and has reduced cost
estimates for introducing portability as a result. BT says other
operators should be able to offer portability to new customers from
early 1996.

TELSTRA TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE INDIAN INVESTMENT
STRATEGY

Telstra is among foreign telecommunication companies which have
decided to alter their investment strategy in India following the
debacle over the awarding of licences to run basic services in 20
regional telecommunication circles.

On 1 January Telstra, along with significant industry players such as
AT&T and US West, failed to re-submit bids for basic service
licences. Only six consortia submitted bids for licences in five
circles. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had earlier
re-opened the tender for 13 licences following the notification of
minimum bids prices.

Telstra spokesman Paul Rea, told Exchange that although India
remains a priority area for investment, DoT's minimum price of
$A3.2 billion for the Tamil Nadu circle was too much. Also, the
present uncertainties discouraged a resubmission for a basic
services licence. Rea said that "Telstra was not prepared to seek the
licence at any price". So instead Telstra would pursue alternative
investment strategies.

Telstra's alternative strategies include joining other international
carriers, with majority Indian partners, in managing basic regional
telecommunication services. Rea confirmed that Telstra has been
approached by foreign telcos to join them in partnerships; he was
not prepared to say which companies. Rea did point out that Telstra
has appointed a senior executive, Dr Sanjay Modak, to head up its
New Delhi office. Modak's appointment indicates that Telstra
considers India one of its most important overseas investment
areas, according to Rea.

Other investment strategies open to Telstra include building its
technology transfer relationship with India's centre for
telecommunications research, C-Dot, and focusing more on cellular
services.

The uncertainties referred to by Rea include the threat to cancel
government awarded licences by India's largest opposition party,
the Bharatiaya Janata Party which - not withstanding the 17 January
arrest of its parliamentary leader on corruption charges - has been
widely tipped to win April general elections, and eight separate
Supreme Court petitions which seek to invalidate the DoT's
authority to award licences. The petitions relate to the failure of the
Congress government to establish a telecommunications regulatory
body before opening the telecommunications sector to foreign
investment.

Meanwhile, Telstra looks set to replace the US' Vanguard Cellular
as an equity partner to Modicom Networks Ltd to run cellular
services in Karnataka and Punjab. The proposal comes after DoT
announced on 12 December that it had awarded 18 licences to run
cellular services in regional areas. If Modicom's proposal is
accepted it will likely encourage other Indian-led consortia to swap
foreign partners in equity arrangements for both cellular and basic
service licences.

OPTUS SHAREHOLDERS TIP IN ANOTHER $200 MILLION

Optus Communications announced on 15 December 1995 that it
had completed a $200 million rights issue to its shareholders.
Bellsouth, Cable and Wireless and Optus Pty Ltd in proportion to
their existing shareholdings of 24.5, 24.5 and 52.1 percent.
Shareholding in Optus Pty Ltd remains unchanged at Mayne
Nickless (49 percent), AMP Society (20 percent) AIDC and other
institutions (19 percent) and National Mutual (12 percent).

The rights issue brings total shareholder equity and loan
contributions to in excess of $2 billion. An attempt to raise $800
million from shareholder equity earlier in the year was rejected by
shareholders.

Optus had planned to disband Optus Pty Ltd in 1994 and make its
shareholders direct shareholders in Optus Communications when
the Nine Network was to take a stake in the company. It announced
in November 1994 that it had been given a Tax Office ruling to be
able to do so without shareholders incurring capital gains tax, but
this latest announcement shows that the move was never made.

TELECOM NZ PAY TV PLAN STYMIED BY LEGAL ACTION

The battle between New Zealand carriers Clear Communications
and Telecom New Zealand over pay TV escalated in late December
when Clear successfully gained an injunction preventing Telecom
New Zealand from proceeding on plans to conclude a pay TV
programming agreement with Sky Television.

Telecom NZ is planning to wire 6000 homes in the country's two
largest cities, Auckland and Wellington to deliver pay TV and
broadband services and has tried to gain programming through the
agreement with Sky. Clear had earlier challenged Telecom NZ's
plan to acquire the 25 percent of Sky shares held by its own major
shareholders, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. Clear argued that such
an acquisition would create a dominant player in the telephony and
pay TV industries. Clear has not indicated any intention to enter the
pay TV or local loop telephony markets.

Clear lawyers were granted access to the confidential programming
agreement and claimed that it constituted a serious breach of the
country's fair trading legislation, the Commerce Act.

The injunction preventing the agreement proceeding until a further
hearing was granted on 21 December. Telecom NZ says it will
defend the action. Its share acquisition plan is dependent on the
programme sharing agreement, and so has also been put on hold.

ABA RELEASES ISSUES PAPER, INVITES COMMENT ON
ONLINE SERVICES

The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) released on 22
December an issues paper as part of its enquiry into content and
conduct of online information services. The ABA was instructed in
August 1995 by the minister for communications and the arts
Michael Lee to "explore strategies to encourage online service
providers and users to meet community needs, including the
development of codes, options for complaints handling, educational
programmes, devices for blocking and filtering certain material and
offence provisions" (Exc August 18. 1995). The 50 page paper
summarises community concerns garnered as a result of
consultative meetings with industry, government and community
organisations.

The ABA says that its consultative process revealed concerns far
more wide ranging than those about adult material and
pornography which have received widespread media coverage.
They included:

- the potential to widely disseminate material that vilifies people on
the basis of race, gender, sexual preference or disability;

- the intrusion of online services into people's privacy,

- the improper use or disclosure of personal information;

- the potential for defamatory material to be widely disseminated;

- the potential for infringement of intellectual property rights;

- the need to ensure that consumer interests are adequately
protected;

- the need to promote a better understanding of gender issues and
gender equality in the on-line environment;

- the need to ensure that Australian content is available and
promoted in an online environment to the same extent that it is in
other media.

The Office of Film and Literature Classification also undertook for
the ABA 27 hours of research searching the Internet for material that
would, in other forms, be restricted by its classification scheme. It
found such material to be less widely and easily available than has
been suggested by recent press coverage of the Internet.

Even after a seven hour search the OFLC was unable to find
material for downloading which would have been covered the
OFLC's category 1 and category 2 classifications governing
depictions of sex and violence in publications.

A copy of the issues paper (approximately 100kb) is available from
http://www.dca.gov.au/aba/hpcov.htm. Deadline for submissions is
16 February.

APRIL LAUNCH FOR TELECOM NZ INTERNET SERVICE

Telecom New Zealand is understood to have set April for the launch
of its Internet service. That service will also see Telecom NZ
become an Internet service access provider and it is also working
on content provision.

Telecom NZ is understood to be primarily targeting the business
market where it believes it can make money. It will try to lure
business customers by offering value added content such as news
services. It also believes that it has a unique differentiator in that
customers can be billed for Internet services on their Telecom
accounts.

Telecom NZ will also offer an access service to the consumer
market but believes the pay-off will take much longer.

The company is buying at least a dozen servers from Silicon
Graphics and is understood to have done a deal with Netscape so
that it can offer a customised version of the Netscape Internet
software.

Reports vary as to how much Telecom NZ is spending on the project
but $NZ50 million is seen by many observers as accurate. It is
understood that more effort is going into this project than into pay TV
moves.

This month Telecom NZ is taking over management of Waikato
University Internet gateway which connects to the USA via links
supplied by AT&T and Sprint. Clear Communications is also
offering services to domestic access providers through a BT link.
Clear will also offer separate frame relay links direct to MCI in the
USA. Adrienne Perry

ASTEC FORECASTS THE FUTURE OF THE CUSTOMER
ACCESS NETWORK

The Australian Science and Technology Council (Astec) has
released a customer access network foresighting study Surf's up:
alternative futures for full service networks in Australia. The study
was undertaken by Astec in conjunction with the Australian National
Training Authority and the Australian Photonics Cooperative
Research Centre.

The term full service network (FSN) is one that has only recently
entered the industry vocabulary. The report defines the FSN as the
successor of today's telecommunications customer access network
which will "integrate entertainment and switched communications
each with multimedia capabilities based on digital technologies. It is
only one component of the future network.

The 70 page report identifies "plausible alternative paths of network
development and the specific science and technology requirements
for such development. It looks at a time horizon up to 2010.

The report sees government initiatives as the major factor in
producing the favourable development of future broadband
networks and services and it makes 10 recommendations almost all
of which call for government action: to facilitate standards
development, market acceptance, lead the way in usage of new
services, commission further study into industry, security and access
issues, continue Astec's foresighting work and generally plan for the
growth of future services.

The report discusses at some length the most suitable technologies
for implementing the FSN. These include: hybrid fibre coax, fibre to
the home, fibre to the curb and ADSL. It lists a number of critical
variables that will affect the deployment of FSNs and attempts to
assess their relative degree of importance and uncertainty. Ranking
highest on both counts are the issues of consumer value and
consumer trust. Industry structure and human interface factors also
rank highly.

The report explores four scenarios:

- Widespread takeup of broadband and narrowband interactive
services by business and industry, but much lower penetration in
the residential sector.

- Widespread takeup by all sectors of the community, leading to
"significant changes in social behaviour, ways of doing business
and attitudes to use of computers".

- Slow take up in all sectors with conflict and confusion about a
multitude of standards and services.

- a disaster scenario in which a series of difficulties prevent the
rollout of a widespread full service network.

STANDARDS' DIGITAL VIDEO REPORT RELEASED

The Digital Video Services Task Group (DVSTG) set up jointly by
Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand to investigate and
recommend on standards development strategies needed for the
delivery of open access digital video services has released its final
recommendations

An earlier draft of the report caused considerable controversy
because it identified a clear need for standards in consumer
equipment for use on future broadband services and called on the
Government to mandate standards "where clear community benefit
is identified" (Exc June 30, 1995). At the time Standards Australia
played down the force of the recommendations saying the
document was only an interim for-comment draft directed at industry
and any 'recommendations' would not have such status until
comments have been received and a final report produced.

The final document, Strategies for the Development of Standards
for Digital Video and Associated Services identifies standards
urgently needed "to ensure that (pay TV) and future services can be
harmoniously introduced". It lists these most critical of these, in
order of importance as:

(1) Standards for customer access interfaces for both broadcast and
interactive digital video services with priority given to hybrid fibre
coaxial cables and satellite, MDS and digital terrestrial delivery.

(2) A standard for baseband analogue video/audio connection to
television receivers, consistent with international standards.

(3) Standards for baseband digital interfaces. These would apply to
digital televisions, multimedia personal computers with plug in
MPEG-2 decoders and digital video recorders. A digital interface
standard for remote control units with optional one-way control, or
two way interactive communications is also required.

The report recommends that all standards be based on an agreed
international digital video and associated services reference model
and it notes that the model developed by the task group maps
closely to that produced by the Digital Audio Visual Council which
was not finalised and not available to the group at the time it
developed the model.

Other recommendations of the report are:

- for a common scrambling algorithm

- a standard application programming interface

- a single customer identification addressing scheme, irrespective of
the service provider

- all existing Australian and New Zealand standards bodies,
technical committees and fora continue with their primary
standardisation and specification efforts under the unified co-
ordination of a single standards body with wide industry
representation.

Copies of the report, catalogue number SAA/SNZMP74-1996 can
be obtained from Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand
sales offices.

US OPENS THE DOOR TO MAJOR TELECOMMS REFORMS

Under a compromise deal brokered by US president Bill Clinton,
the House-Senate conference committee has agreed to deregulate
the US telecommunications sector agreeing to Democrats'
demands that industry concentration is countered.

Despite Republican claims that the proposed deregulation bill does
not go far enough, the legislation will see sweeping reforms that will
essentially end government barriers to the tie-up between long-
distance telephony, local telephony and cable television.

Analysts predict a series of mergers as the US telecommunications
industry becomes free to offer seamless information services. Nynex
and Bell Atlantic are already said to be discussing merger plans in
preparation for the deregulation.

Republicans accepted limits on the size of broadcasting companies,
but insisted on provisioning to slow the elimination of cable TV price
controls and make it more difficult for Baby Bells to enter long
distance enterprises. Price controls on cable TV companies will
remain only to 1999 and will end sooner if a competitor enters a
market.

In towns with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, cable TV operators can
immediately raise rates.

Nynex will be especially favoured in the new laws and Bell Atlantic
and Pacific Telesis will do well because those closest to meeting
tougher requirements to get into long distance will have
advantages. The broadcasters, and especially News Corp will not
be happy. A single TV company will be allowed to reach 35 percent
of the US population but the FCC can cancel waivers letting Fox
Broadcasting go beyond 35 percent.

Rules forbidding a TV broadcaster owning a local newspaper or a
second station in one market still are on the books and the FCC still
will be overseeing Baby Bells (with input from the Justice
Department) as they seek to go into long-distance telephony
services

* The Federal Communications Commission said that the partial
government shutdown and bad weather along much of the US east
coast this week had forced the agency to postpone its 18 January
open meeting. The FCC has tentatively set 31 January as the new
meeting date to discuss president Bill Clinton's brokered changes to
the 1934 Communications Act.

Parker had been tipped as a successor to Telstra CEO Frank Blount
but Blount recently signed a second three year contract and Telstra
insiders have suggested that the lure of a chief executive's role

NEWS BRIEFS

* Prices for international telephone calls continue to fall with
Worldxchange announcing cuts on 8 January, in response to
Telstra's cuts announced on 1 December which come into effect on
1 February. Optus is also expected to announce substantial price
cuts before the end of January. Worldxchange, which has a flat rate
24 hours per day, now offers discounts of up to 50 percent on
Telstra's peak STD rate to the UK, USA and Japan, 41.5 percent to
Taiwan and Switzerland and 37.5 percent to Germany. Figures are
based on a call of less than three minutes. The company has
announced an additional special discount to Asian countries during
Ramadan (1-20 February) and Chinese New Year (18-28
February).

* Austel has released a for-comment draft of its technical standard
on end-to-end network performance (TS27). The standard will
ensure that all public and private telecommunications networks
carrying public traffic within Australia can support text, telephone,
fax and popular dial up modem applications at data rates up to
2400 bits/sec. It also specifies performance of low to medium rate
data applications such as telephone typewriters for the hearing
impaired. The standard was first issued in June 1994, but
addressed only performance standards for voice calls. Comments
are required by 28 February 1996. Copies of the draft can be
obtained from Standards Australia sales offices. (14/12/95)

* Plans to hold the first International Telecommunications Users
Group conference and exhibition in Asia, in Shanghai in 1996, have
fallen through. The exhibition and conference was to have been
organised on Intug's behalf by Total Concept Exhibitions of Sydney.
Total Concept wrote to interested parties at the end of November
1995 saying that the planned location in Shanghai would be
unavailable in time. Peter Braun of TCE told Exchange this week
that the company was now looking to work with the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade to participate in the New Horizons event
in New Delhi in November and was looking to have the conference
sponsored by the Asia Oceania Electronic Messaging Association
instead of Intug.

* Austel's Technical Standard 002 has been altered to require all
incoming voice calls on a PABX to be either answered by a
recorded voice announcement, or else not connected. The
amendment follows a consumer complaint which found callers have
been charged for dialling an engaged signal on PABXs (12/95).

* A voluntary standard to inform consumers about the government's
policy on the phaseout of analogue mobile services by 1 January
2000 has been agreed by Austel and mobile telephone industry
representatives. Austel member, Sue Harlow, said that Austel would
monitor the effectiveness of the voluntary standard and would
consider mandatory standards if it is not successful. (11/1/96)

* Telecommunications reseller First Netcomm Pty Ltd has been
instructed by the ACCC to make refunds to customers because it
had given them misleading advice about the savings they would
make if they transferred their telephone service to First Netcomm.
The company was using multilevel marketing techniques to sell its
services and the ACCC also found that it had mislead its distributors
about the amount of income they could earn. They were told they
could earn up to $20,000 per month but "by the end of October
1995, the most that had been made by any distributor in one month
was $411".

* Austel has released a for-comment draft of a technical standard
(TS29) covering telecommunications charging and billing. It sets
minimum performance levels for both carrier and service provider
billing systems and "is intended to provide a framework for
monitoring the quality of those systems. For digital networks using
software billing it proposes maximum errors of no more than 22
calls in 100,000 to be charged incorrectly and no more than one
charge for an unmade call for every 200,000 calls. Errors in call
duration are limited to six in 100,000 calls. Submissions are due by
28 February. Copies of the draft can be obtained from Standards
Australia sales offices. (20/12/95)

* Telstra has awarded a major contract to Boston Technology of the
US to supply messaging systems for the GSM and analogue mobile
networks. Boston said it would supply "numerous" Access TP
network services platforms to Mobilenet to support a range of
services for Messagebank customers including call answering,
voice messaging, fax messaging, short message service and
paging alert. "Additional enhanced services will be offered via these
platforms in the future", according to Boston. Telstra will retain its
supply agreements with other vendors.

* In the National Business Bulletin's 1995 Corporate Image Survey
Ericsson improved its ranking in the telecommunications and
telephone systems categories. It came in third in the
telecommunications and telephone systems categories after Telstra
and Optus and ahead of NEC (4) and Vodafone (5). Alcatel fell from
sixth to tenth position. In telephone systems Ericsson pushed NEC
into third position coming in second after Telstra. However it failed
to make the top 10 in mobile phones, where the top five ranking
from one to five was: Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Telstra and Optus.
Nokia, the magazine reported, was the big surprise rising from fifth
position and pushing Telstra and Optus down.

* Inmarsat has appointed UK advertising agency Publicis as its
global advertising agency charged with establishing Inmarsat as a
brand among target audiences internationally. The head of Publicis'
international division, Joanna Baldwin, described the project as
"converting one of the world's best kept secrets into a global brand".

* The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
has released a guide to Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act, which
covers access to essential services. "Part IIIA introduces a new field
of regulatory responsibilities and access rights which will have
significant impact on the provision of services that are critical to
competition in related areas", according to ACCC chairman, Allan
Fels. Phone (06) 264 2808 for details (19/12/95).

* Low-orbit communications satellites will be launched from
Woomera in South Australia within 18 months after an agreement
between STC Complex of Russia and the engineering division of
the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC), according to Senator
Chris Schacht. Schacht said on 13 January that ASC had signed a
letter of intent with STC Complex to set down a business plan for a
commercial Australian space launch service in which ASC
Engineering will manufacture satellite launch support equipment
and provide project management and systems integration with the
Russian company supplying the START family launch vehicles.
STC Complex was established by the Moscow Institute of Heat
Technology, the company which developed three generations of
Russian mobile rockets.

* Vodafone claims that it now offers the world's largest global
roaming network with 38 participating countries, including 18
countries with automatic global roaming facilities. Vodafone's
managing director, John Rohan, said that New Zealand was the
latest addition to the global network and that several more countries
would be added to the network during 1996. (12/1/96)

* Vodac and Apple Computer have released an integrated package
for mobile access to office databases and the Internet. The Vodac
Data Solution ties Apple's Newton Messagepad 120 GSM
connectivity to Vodafone's mobile digital network using a Nokia
2110 mobile phone, a Nokia cellular data card, Winfax Pro 4.0
communications software and a PCMCIA slot for a portable
computer. (9/1/96)

* Datacraft Ltd's Latin American subsidiary has received $7 million
worth of orders from Columbia, Mexico and Brazil in the first half of

expected to handle over 12 million calls in its first year, according to
Terry Winters, the managing director of Link. Winters said that Link's
messaging business is currently growing at 35 percent per year and
that during 1995 the company handled around 50 million calls and
a further 20 million from direct access clients.

* New standards for the global information highway have been
approved by the ITU. A revised text of Recommendation G.707,
which includes G.708 and G.709 has been approved at the study
group level. Recommendations include setting standards for:
transport networks, including bit-rates, frame structure for SDH
networks and network management; audiovisual systems, including
protocols and coding for visual telephony; and for ATM equipment.
(5/1/96)

* The Telecommunications Development Advisory Board (TDAB) of
the ITU has called for clear strategies to attract more partners to the
development activities of the telecommunications sector and the
development of a strategy for the application of interactive television
in developing countries. The Director of the Telecommunications
Development Bureau, Ahmed Laouyane, told a December meeting
of the TDAB that strategic partnership and mobilisation of resources
were crucial to the success of the telecommunications sector.
(5/1/96)

* Mobile service provider Digicall Group claims a 75 percent rise in
subscriber numbers in the December quarter to more than 61,000,
from about 35,000 in the previous three months. This is an increase
of over 26,000 for the three month period, compared to just 2,956
net additions for the same quarter last year, or 16,000 net additions
for 1995. However, billing revenues grew by only 62 percent over
the final quarter to $9.7 million. Digicall's profit before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals increased by 200
percent on the previous quarter to $1.32 million. Digicall opened 30
shops during December and plans to open another 15 early in
1996.

* Telstra and Bay Networks Australia have signed an enhanced
distribution channel (EDC) partnership which will provide a joint
commercial venture for a tightly-integrated set of products and
services to specific vertical markets, according to Steve Wood,
regional director for Bay Networks. Under the EDC Bay Networks
will provide products for Telstra's networking and data services,
WAN and remote access. (8/1/96)

* Advance Bank has claimed an Australian first by offering its
customers access to their accounts through the Internet. All
customer information is encrypted for transmission in both directions
using Techway locally built software. In November Exchange
foreshadowed that Web Australia, a division of Techway, would
soon announce the first customer for its Catalogue Server using
RSA and IDEA v2.2 software (Exc November 24, 1995).

* The Telecommunications Ombudsman, John Pinnock, has
announced the resolution of another casualty of Telstra (COT)
claimant's case. However, because the COT arbitration cases are
confidential Pinnock did not release further details. (23/12/95)
