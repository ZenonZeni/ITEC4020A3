Reps. Markey and Fields attack Emmanuel Goldstein <p>

The latest issue of CuD has a transcript from a House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance hearing from last June.  Here are some
excerpts. <p>

Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Guidry, very much.
     We will take questions now from the subcommittee members.
     Let me begin, Mr. Delaney. I would like you and Mr. Goldstein
to engage in a conversation, if we could. This is Mr. Goldstein's
magazine, "The Hacker Quarterly: 2600," and for $4 we could go out
to Tower Records here in the District of Columbia and purchase
this. It has information in it that, from my perspective, is very
troubling in terms of people's cellular phone numbers and
information on how to crack through into people's private
information.
     Now you have got some problems with "The Hacker Quarterly,"
Mr. Delaney.
     Mr. DELANEY. Yes, sir.
     Mr. MARKEY. And your problem is, among other things, that
teenagers can get access to this and go joy riding into people's
private records. <p>

... <p>

Mr. MARKEY. Well, I don't know. You are being a little bit
disingenuous here, Mr. Goldstein. Here, on page 17 of your spring
edition of 1993, "How to build a pay TV descrambler." Now that is
illegal.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Not building. Building one is not illegal.
     Mr. MARKEY. Oh, using one is illegal?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Exactly.
     Mr. MARKEY. I see. So showing a teenager, or anyone, how to
build a pay TV descrambler is not illegal. But what would they do
then, use it as an example of their technological prowess that they
know how to build one? Would there not be a temptation to use it,
Mr. Goldstein? <p>

... <p>

Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Most likely, yes. But the thing is, we don't
believe that because something could be used in a bad way, that is
a reason to stifle the knowledge that goes into it.
     Mr. MARKEY. That is the only way this could be used. Is there
a good way in which a pay TV descrambler could be used that is a
legal way?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Certainly, to understand how the technology
works in the first place, to design a way of defeating such devices
in the future or to build other electronic devices based on that
technology.
     Mr. MARKEY. I appreciate that, but it doesn't seem to me that
most of the subscribers to "2600" magazine -- [interruption - damn, I
*really* want to know what he was going to say - shari] <p>

... <p>

MARKEY.     ...Similarly here, we assume that there is a certain percentage
of pathologically damaged people out there. The cerebral mechanism
doesn't quite work in parallel with the rest of society. We have to
pass laws to protect the rest of us against them. We will call them
criminal hackers. What do we do to deal with them is the question
that we are going to be confronted with in the course of our
hearings?
     Let me recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Fields.
     Mr. FIELDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
     Just for my own edification, Mr. Goldstein, you appear to be
intelligent; you have your magazine, so obviously you are
entrepreneurial. For me personally, I would like to know, why don't
you channel the curiosity that you talk about into something that
is positive for society? And, I'm going to have to say to you, I
don't think it is positive when you invade someone else's privacy.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. I agree. <p>

... <p>

Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Guidry, one last question. Is it the Secret
Service that is at the forefront of Federal activity?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Yes, sir, it is.
     Mr. FIELDS. Do they have the resources to adequately deal with
this problem?
     Mr. GUIDRY. No, sir. The problem is growing so rapidly that
they are undermanned in this area but have asked for additional
manpower.
     Mr. FIELDS. Is this a priority for the Secret Service?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Yes, sir, it is. <p>
