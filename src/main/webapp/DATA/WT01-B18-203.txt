<title>Long-Term Solutions Must Include Improved Urban Design</title>

<H2><I>D. </I>Long-Term Solutions Must Include Improved Urban Design</H2>
<P>
For the last 40 years, urban form has revolved around the automobile. 
Engineers have designed roadways to enhance vehicle speeds, rather than 
pedestrian safety. In many suburban developments, the sidewalk has 
disappeared altogether. Shopping centers are often set far from 
residential areas. Catering to patrons who arrive by automobile, they 
provided excessive parking, limited pedestrian assess, and no bicycle 
facilities. <BR>
<p>     America has become a nation where the automobile seems necessary to 
accomplish daily tasks and leisure pursuits. Road systems are often unable 
to keep up with demand and congestion continues to worsen. The spatial 
separation between jobs, homes, stores, and recreation is increasing. 
Those segments of our society that do not drive have been marginalized 
from mainstream society and employment opportunities.<BR>
<p>     If the United States is to seriously address carbon dioxide emissions 
in the transportation sector, it will be necessary to reorient our urban 
design toward people rather than cars. Urban structures cannot be changed 
overnight. However, there are signs that efforts to improve urban design 
have already begun. The goal is to create more livable communities. The 
side benefit will be cleaner air and reduced carbon dioxide emissions.<P>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="MetroLink,St.Louis">MetroLink, St. Louis<a>.</B></I> One urban design success story 
is St. Louis' light-rail system, MetroLink. Using federal highway funds 
for construction, the system opened in 1993, 32 years after the city's 
last commuter rail line closed. Careful planning, implementation, and 
promotion have made MetroLink a model transit and land-use planning 
success. <BR>
<p>    <p>      MetroLink is an economic boon to the city, and people find they 
both like and <I>use</I> the rail line. It has reduced traffic on St. 
Louis' most congested freeways and lowered demand for downtown parking 
facilities. MetroLink uses less energy per mile and produces less air 
pollution per passenger-mile than automobiles. The system reached its 
five-year ridership goal in its first year. The citizens of St. Louis 
approved a sales tax increase to expand MetroLink and improve other 
transit services. <BR>
<p>    <p>      The most significant factor in MetroLink's success is its 
land-use planning approach: St. Louis uses a radial corridor land-use 
pattern. Radial patterns lend themselves to transit development because 
population densities in the corridors tend to be high, increasing chances 
that ridership, too, will be higher than it would be in cities with grid 
development patterns. Also, radial corridor cities tend to have a lot of 
magnets - shopping centers, museums, and sports arenas - within 
walking distance of transit stations. MetroLink facilitates a resurgence 
of a land-use pattern more widely known before the age of the 
automobile - the American village land-use pattern - where most 
daily conveniences were located within walking distance. This pattern 
could prevail for land-use planning in the 21st century.<a href="#297" name="r297"> [ 297 ] </a>

</B><p>     <B><I>Chicago's <A NAME="CommunityGreenLineInitiative,Chicago">Community Green Line Initiative, Chicago </a></I>. </B>The 
Community Green Line Initiative is a planned community-based 
transit-oriented development centered around the Pulaski Street Station in 
Chicago. The Pulaski Street Station is part of what used to be the Lake 
Street Elevated Line - now the Green Line - one of Chicago's 
historic elevated transit lines. In 1994, the line shut down for a 
two-year reconstruction project, which will include building or renovating 
28 transit stations. <BR>
<p>     Within a half mile of the Green Line live 118,000 people - a 
population similar to a small city. Only half of these households have 
access to a car. Members of the community developed the Green Line 
Initiative to boost transit ridership, reduce automobile dependence, stem 
the abandonment of buildings, and increase job opportunities - all 
while contributing to regional air quality goals. West Garfield, the 
community surrounding Pulaski Station, has suffered greatly from 
development patterns that favor sprawl, structural disinvestment, and 
suburban infrastructure funding - all patterns that continue to 
contribute to the social and economic disintegration of inner cities 
across the United States. The Community Green Line Initiative has 
encouraged citizen involvement in planning, and seeks to upgrade the 
neighborhoods surrounding the Green Line by making the area an attractive 
place to live, work, raise families, and shop. New jobs will be 
created - within walking distance of workers' homes. The land-use plan 
calls for rebuilding neighborhood density with new housing, revitalizing 
the neighborhood economy with retail and commercial development, and 
creating new public parks. <BR>
<p>    <p>      The Green Line Initiative has taken advantage of federal funds 
made available through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency 
Act (ISTEA), which mandates broad changes in the way transportation 
decisions are made and funded, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air 
Quality Program (CMAQ), a component of ISTEA, which provides funds for 
projects that reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. To help 
the initiative qualify for these funds, the <A NAME="AmericanLungAssociation">American Lung Association</a> 
(ALA) projected the air quality impacts of the project. According to the 
ALA, the Green Line Initiative will eliminate 17.5 percent of vehicle 
trips to work and 20 percent of all other trips, thereby saving 1,556 
vehicle miles traveled every day. These reductions could cut ozone 
precursors, including VOCs, by 6.9 metric tons, and nitrogen oxides by 
2.75 metric tons per year.<a href="#298" name="r298"> [ 298 ] </a>
