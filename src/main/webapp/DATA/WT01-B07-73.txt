ABSTRACT The Korean folk house has created a comfortable indoor
environment with passive control of outdoor climate as an example
of environmental architecture. This study aims to identify the
peculiar elements of environmental architecture in folk houses
in Cheju Island and Ullung Island through field experiments. The
elements of environmental control of folk houses in both islands
could be developed as design elements of modern architecture.
This effort can play a major role to find the passive design principles
and techniques of environmental control of the building which
have been neglected in the design of modern architecture.

ABSTRACT Indoor air quality within buildings depends on the contaminants
production within the buildings themselves, the outside air quality
and the features of the air conditoning systems. A proper design
of the air conditioning systems is required in order to achieve
a satisfactory result. In 1963 UNI 5104 came into force in Italy,
dealing with supply, order and testing of the systems. UNI 5104
was updated in April 1991, as far as indoor air quality was concerned,
but was still very rough. The minimum air change rate was fixed
at 15 m3/(h person) for non smoking rooms and at 20-25 m3/(h person)
if smoking is allowed. Higher values were foreseen for meeting
rooms and cinemas, theatres and similar buildings. Furthermore
some general &quot;suggestions&quot; were given about the air
filtration.

ABSTRACT District heating and cooling (DHC) can provide multiple
opportunities to reduce air emissions associated with space conditioning
and electricity generation, which contribute 30% to 50% of all
such emissions. When DHC is combined with cogeneration (CHP) maximum
reductions in sulfur oxides (SOx) nitrogen oxides (NOx) carbon
dioxide (CO2), particulates, and ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC) refrigerants can most effectively be achieved. Although
significant improvements in air quality have been documented in
Europe and Scandinavia due to DHC and CHP implementation, accurately
predicting such improvements has been difficult. Without acceptable
quantification methods, regulatory bodies are reluctant to grant
air emissions credits, and local community leaders are unwilling
to invest in DHC and CHP as preferred methods of providing energy
or strategies for air quality improvement. The recent development
and release of a number of computer models designed specifically
to provide quantification of air emissions that can result from
DHP and CHP implementation should help provide local, state, and
national policymakers with information vital to increasing support
and investment in DHC development.

ABSTRACT Historically, residential energy efficiency services
have been subsidized by utility ratepayers and by taxpayers through
federal and state government programs. Over the last 10 years,
customers have received free home energy audits, large rebates
for efficiency products and services, and in some instances, free
efficiency measures. Now with deregulation of the utility industry
on the horizon, along with cutbacks in federal and state spending,
money is becoming less available for these programs. As a result,
providers of residential energy services are beginning to look
for ways to generate income that can cover all or most of the
costs of providing these services. The major challenge ahead is
determining how to design programs in which customers value the
services enough to pay for them. Through a series of four community
efficiency projects, Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corporation
(WECC) is striving to determine if residential efficiency services
can indeed be self-sustaining, or if they will perpetually require
some level of subsidy to exist.

ABSTRACT The energy cost of monitoring and controlling a building
environment is a serious consideration for the heating, ventilating,
and air-conditions (HVAC) engineering industry. This work is focused
on minimizing the energy cost associated with the control of variable-air
volume (VAV) systems. All the experimental work was performed
using a low-speed wind tunnel. The authors modified a low-speed
wind tunnel to simulate a single VAV system. We also developed
a dynamic model of the system and analyzed its energy consumption
characteristics. Conventional proportional and integral (PI) control,
adaptive control and optimal control algorithms were developed
and applied to the duct pressure control loop within the VAV system.
A comparison of the performance of these control algorithms indicates
that an optimal control strategy can save up to 30% of the energy
consumed in a system that employs a conventional PI control scheme.

ABSTRACT The considerations made in designing ventilating and

picture of the current practice. Questionnaires were distributed
to building services engineering consultants, contractors, and
operation firms to collect information related to the primary
design objectives, design guides, and criteria selected: consideration
of the air flow pattern in the ventilated space induced by the
system; and the associated theories. An evaluation of the current
design tools was also made in the survey. The information was
then compiled, and it was found that improved methods for designing
air distribution systems may be warranted.

ABSTRACT Laboratory animal ventilation systems should be designed
to provide acceptable environmental conditions within the room
and within cages. This study was conducted to review and evaluate
ventilation strategies for improving thermal and air quality conditions
in laboratory animal facilities. It has long been recognized that
the cage microenvironment can be considerably different from the
room macroenvironment. However, most research on laboratory animal
ventilation has focused on room conditions. There is limited information
regarding ventilation rates, room air distribution, and other
factors required to maintain acceptable and uniform environment
in all animal cages. Current ventilation guidelines are based
largely on room conditions, not on cage microenvironment. Recommended
room ventilation rates (10 to 15 outside air changes per hour
[ACH]) are based on keeping odors below objectionable levels for
humans and have little scientific basis. Recent research shows
that the recommended room air exchange rate of 10 to 15 ACH is
energy intensive yet does not ensure adequate air quality for
laboratory animals. Field studies show that numerous types of
air diffusers are being used in typical laboratory animal rooms,
and most rooms have high-supply, high-return systems. Expert survey
results indicate that designers prefer or specify laminar flow
ceiling diffusers, low exhaust location and small laboratory rooms.

ABSTRACT Adequate ventilation is essential in houses to ensure
acceptable indoor air quality and to control condensation. In
Canada, the measure of adequate ventilation in a house will be
compliance with the Canadian standard CAN/CSA-F326-M91 &quot;Residential
Mechanical Ventilation Systems&quot;, which specifies the minimum
outdoor air change rate for the entire house as well as ventilation
rates to individual rooms to ensure adequate air distribution
within the house. The five ventilation systems were installed
in the NRC two-storey research house which also has an electric
forced-air heating system. The ventilation performance of each
system was measured for a variety of weather conditions using
single and multiple tracer gas techniques. Their air change rates
and room-by-room ventilation rates were measured and compared
with similar reference measurements in the house with no ventilation
and with only the forced-air furnace fan operating.

ABSTRACT The motor fan set efficiency of residential ventilation
equipment is typically very low. With vast improvements in energy
conservation in other sectors of the residential market - such
as building envelope insulation, air sealing and window technology,
and more efficient heating and cooling equipment - ventilation
equipment energy consumption could no longer be ignored. The trend
toward the continuous use of ventilation equipment is leading
to ever increasing energy saving potential. CMHC sponsored this
project in order to find out the extent to which industry wanted
to develop its own timeline toward the use of more efficient fan/motor
sets.

ABSTRACT This paper presents the results of experimental research
performed to study the flow characteristics of isothermal jets
issuing from vortex diffusers and to compare the vortex diffusers
performance with that of a conventional diffuser. Two styles of
vortex diffusers and one conventional circular ceiling diffuser
were used. For each diffuser, measurements were performed to obtain
a velocity map, velocity profile, and velocity decay at three
different flow rates. A series of flow visualization experiments
was undertaken to capture the general behavior of jets issuing
from the diffusers. Overall, it was found that the vortex diffusers
produce slightly more induction (mixing) of ambient air in comparison
to the conventional diffuser. This difference is probably caused
by the turbulence produced as a result of the rotational motion
near the outlet of the vortex diffusers. The rotational motion
disappears within three outlet diameters, and the flow becomes
radial.

ABSTRACT Data were collected in a large test room (24 by 16 by
9ft [7.3 by 4.9 by 2.7m]) with a high sidewall grille. the airflow
characteristics at the centerline of the room for 21 test cases
for both isothermal and nonisothermal flow conditions were investigated.
The results show that both airflow rate and heat load strongly
affect airflow patterns and air velocity and air temperature inside
the room. As the airflow rate increases and/or heat load decreases,
the air jet travels further along the ceiling and lessens the
chance of dropping into the occupied zone. On the other hand,
as the airflow rate decreases and/or heat load increases, the
air jet separates form the ceiling and moves down toward the occupied
zone, causing air at higher velocities and lower temperatures
to reach occupants resulting in a possible sensation of draft
(coolness). Furthermore, stagnant areas form due to the lack of
air circulation.

ABSTRACT Environmental control systems for museums, art galleries
and other special buildings typically must control more than just
air temperature and humidity, and must often provide much tighter
control than is expected from conventional air conditioning systems.
The priceless artifacts and art treasures housed in such buildings
can be permanently damaged if the environment is not continuously
controlled. The comfort of occupants also should be considered.
Six principle factors are generally considered in the design of
such systems: air temperature, air humidity, light, air circulation,
air-borne pollutants, and sound level. This paper discusses these
factors and how they were addressed in the design of the air conditioning
system for the Sistine Chapel, and provides general guidelines
for other special buildings.

ABSTRACT Most of the modern office buildings and dwellings in
Sri Lanka are designed with the assumption that electrical air-conditioning
systems will be used to cope with the country`s high humidity
and warm climate. The possibility of utilizing passive cooling
concepts for that purpose has yet to be explored by architects.
This paper investigates the suitability of such cooling concepts
for local conditions. Simple architectural modifications and a
few changes in the usage patterns may result in a reduction in
indoor temperature of 3.0 and 0.4 degreesC, respectively, for
a daily maximum and minimum temperature of 30.9 and 27.2 degreesC,
respectively, in a dwelling in Colombo in December. The achievement
of comfort, described by satisfactory levels of a predicted percentage
of dissatisfied, is also documented. Simulation results are compared

ABSTRACT Evaporative coolers cost only one-tenth to one-fourth
as much to operate as refrigeration air conditioning and are much
cheaper to buy. This make them an excellent option, particularly
in hot, dry areas of the country. An evaporative cooler is a simple
device consisting of a fan and a water-wetted pad. A small pump
recirculates water from a sump (which is part of the cooler cabinet)
to keep the pad wet. The fan draws outside air through the wet
pad, making the air more humid but colder. This air is blown into
the house forcing the warmer air in the house to be exhausted
out open windows or through a vent into the attic. This is quite
different from refrigeration air conditioning, which cools inside
air and returns it to the house. Although the use of outside air
is one major benefit of evaporative coolers, it also complicates
their installation and operation. The evaporative cooler must
be installed outside the house, ducted into the house, and freeze
protected and isolated from the house during winter months.

ABSTRACT This paper presents results of a study of the pressure
drop in a scale model of a stairshaft with closed treads. A 1:10
scale model of a 10 story stairshaft was build to study airflow
resistance within the shaft under isothermal conditions, including
the effect of occupant density. Three cases were investigated:
a stairshaft with no occupant, a shaft with medium density, and
one with high-density occupancy. In addition, the effects of the
distribution of occupants in the stairshaft were studied. The
pressure drop through the model stairshaft was measured at each
story for a range of volume flow rates between 0.0368 and 0.0901m3/s
(1.29 and 3.18 ft3/s) introduced at a single injection point at
the top of the stairshaft. The pressure loss coefficient for the
scale model with no occupants was found to be approximately 33.2.
The results obtained are comparable to published measurements
made in full-scale stairshafts with typical floor heights between
3.2m and 3.85m. The pressure drop varies linearly with the height
of the stairshaft and varies directly with the square of the supply
air rates. Results from the test demonstrate the same trend as
reported in the literature - that the pressure loss coefficient
is a function of the occupant density in the stairshaft. The loss
coefficient increased by a factor of approximately two when the
model was populated to simulate occupancy at medium occupant density
and by a factor of three at high occupant density when compared
to that of the empty stairshaft. The pressure loss coefficients
for the scale model at medium and high occupant densities were
found to be approximately 65.7 and 95.9 respectively. The results
also agree with published results that the distribution of occupants,
whether on the landings at each story or between floors, has little
effect on the loss coefficients for medium- and high-density occupancy.

ABSTRACT Chilled ceilings aren't any easy task for planners and
architects, since the functional principles, influenced by various
parameters, have to combine with the room and ceiling design.
For these reasons different cooling systems with different functions
are normally provided. Therefore, any proposal by builders has
to be correctly compared and valued by planners; this task was
made necessary by the actual status of experiences and studies
in this field and possible by the outstanding standards.
