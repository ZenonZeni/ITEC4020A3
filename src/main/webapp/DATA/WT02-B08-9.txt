<TITLE>"Addicted to Middle East Oil"</TITLE>
<CENTER><H3>ADDICTED TO MIDDLE EAST OIL</H3>
<P>
<i>by Eric Vaughn, President, Renewable Fuels Association</I></CENTER> 
<P>

<DD>The United States has a substance abuse problem. The substance is oil and we will do anything to get a fix.
<DD>As an example of the lengths we will go to maintain our habit, the United States recently approved a plan allowing Iraq's return to the oil export business at the rate of $4 billion per year.  Much of that oil is expected to be imported by the United States, even though Saddam Hussein remains a threat to regional peace and stability.
<DD>Unfortunately, this victory for Saddam Hussein, along with the earlier tragic bomb attack in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. airmen protecting our interests -- an increasingly uncertain oil supply -- demonstrate the dangers of our nation's growing dependence on foreign oil.
<DD>In 1970, the U.S. imported 23 percent of its petroleum needs.  By 1973, the number had grown to 35 percent.  Today, it is 54 percent and the Department of Energy's independent Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects it to exceed 60 percent by the year 2010. 
<DD>The dollar costs of this oil aren't cheap.  In 1994 alone, the U.S. spent $51 billion on oil imports.  In 1995, oil imports added $48 billion to the U.S. trade deficit of almost $160 billion.  Since 1990, oil imports have added $281.3 billion to America's balance-of-trade deficit, comprising 41 percent of the nation's total imbalance of trade.
<DD>There are high military costs associated with our foreign oil dependence.  We have recently witnessed the loss of life.  Military costs to protect our foreign energy sources have been estimated at $35 billion per year.  That is more than $12 for every barrel of imported oil or 55 cents per gallon of gasoline.   
<DD>Our foreign oil dependence has also cut hundreds of thousands of domestic jobs, cost us billions of dollars in trade, impaired air quality in our nation's cities, jeopardized public health, stifled economic growth, and devastated our domestic energy production infrastructure.
<DD>Our exclusive use of oil for transportation energy is a key factor in foreign oil dependence.  Today, Americans are driving farther, faster, in larger vehicles, consuming more gasoline than ever before.  In 1994, petroleum used for transportation in the U.S. averaged 10.8 million barrels a day, 65 percent of the nation's total petroleum use.  This demand exceeded domestic petroleum production by 61 percent.
<DD>There are alternatives to imported oil.  Today, tens of thousands of vehicles throughout the U.S. are powered by fuels other than conventional gasoline.  Many urban areas battling air quality problems are operating fleets on alternatives such as compressed natural gas, propane, biodiesel and ethanol.  We need to continue to pursue these alternatives as part of a broad national energy strategy that promotes domestic energy sources in an effort to break our foreign oil habit.
<DD>Renewable fuels can play a central role in this policy.  Fuels such as ethanol, made from corn, and biodiesel, made from soybeans, offer the promise of domestically produced energy that is abundant, affordable and clean.  There is also the potential for making ethanol from biomass, which includes waste products like corn fiber, rice straw, sawdust, pulp and paper sludge and yard clippings -- or from energy crops such as switch grass, prairie grasses and fast-growing trees.  These sources offer a tremendous opportunity for new jobs for the rural economy, as well as environmental benefits through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
<DD>The National Association of State Energy Officials recently reiterated its support for renewable energy.  In a letter to members of the U.S. Senate, the Association said:  "Renewable energy is critical to our Nation's future... we must do all we can to reduce our reliance on energy imports and diversify our energy resources."
<DD>A national domestic energy policy which promotes renewable fuels is long overdue.  We need to put a stop to exporting energy jobs and investment overseas.  The use of domestic, renewable fuels will strengthen our domestic economy, lower our trade deficit, and secure our energy future for our children.  
<DD>Renewable fuels are also a smart choice for the environment.  They burn cleaner than gasoline, reduce toxic emissions from automobiles, and reduce global warming.
<DD>Our current energy policy, or lack of one, is leading this country down a dangerous road of increased oil dependence, threatening our national security and most importantly, increasing the risk that more American lives will be sacrificed to satisfy our thirst for foreign oil.  It is time we "just say no" -- to imported oil.<BR>
