<B>INHERENT PROBLEMS WITH OFF-LINE PROGRAMMING</B>
</P>
<P>
Once the decision has been made to off-line program robots, the next step in the
process is calibration. When working in the virtual world of robot simulation
and off-line programming, everything in the workcell is perfect. The robot is
accurate and the fixtures are perfectly placed.
</P>

Once a program is taken to the floor, however, it is often found that the robot
is not placed exactly as it should have been, the fixture does not rotate in an
exact circle, and <a href="../accrep/accrep.htm" target="Main">the robot itself has inaccuracies</a> that have not been taken
into account in the simulation. These inaccuracies are not the fault of the
robot manufacturers, or the fixture installers, it is just a fact of life that
installations are not exact.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, this is the place where off-line programming has found it's
biggest critics. When the programs are first run, some programs miss the
teachpoints by as much as three inches. A robot operator must then go back and
re-teach the entire program with a teach pendant. Not only does this take time,
but the assumed advantage of off-line programming has been completely negated.
</P>
<P>
Besides the money and time spent re-programming the robot with the teach
pendant, a significant amount of money is also spent trying to duplicate exactly
the positioning of the robot and fixtures. Using lasers and other high-tech
devices, the fixtures and robots in a factory are placed as accurately and as
level as possible. Although this improves the chances the program will work, it
is still not as accurate as the simulation<I>. As much as $50,000 per workcell
can be spent to get the positioning &quot;close.&quot;</I>
</P>
<P>
The robot in the simulation does not suffer from the inaccuracies of the real
robot (tolerances in the manufacturing process, backlash, and general wear and
tear). In order to fix this there must be some way of finding these errors and
reducing them as much as possible. Once the errors are found they can be used to
modify the kinematics of the robot model within the simulation.
</P>
<P>
<B>ROBOTRAK IS THE SOLUTION</B>
</P>
<P>
The solution to this is to find the &quot;signature&quot; of the robot and the
workcell through calibration. Calibration only really works, however, if it is
tied directly to a simulation program When tied with a simulation program, the
kinematics of the robot model can more easily be modified.
</P>

is an optional measuring system for Workspace, a PC-based simulation and
off-line programming system. It is capable of measuring static positions or
motion paths to an accuracy of 0.2 mm (0.008 inches) in three dimensions. The
software needed to analyze the robot performance and to modify the robot model's
kinematics is combined within Workspace as one piece of seamless software. No
other system offers this worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Robotrak calibration system consists of the following components:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Three incremental encoder measuring units.
</LI>
<LI>A robot end effector interface.
</LI>
<LI>An ISA computer interface card.
</LI>
<LI>A reference bar of known length.
</LI>
<LI>A PC running Workspace with the Calibration+ option.
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>
<B>USING ROBOTRAK</B>
</P>
<P>
The three high resolution encoder units are placed anywhere within the working
envelope of the robot The units should be placed roughly at the corners of an
equilateral triangle. This placement does not have to be precise, however,
setting the units in a straight line must be avoided. The encoder units are then
plugged into the computer running Workspace through the data acquisition card.
</P>
<P>
A non-stretch cord with a constant tension on it is then pulled from each of the
encoder units and calibrated with the use of a reference bar. Once a conversion
of encoder counts to length is established for each unit, the relative distance
between the three encoder units is determined by pulling the cords from each
unit to the adjacent unit. At this point the encoder units are ready to begin
calibrating the robot.
</P>
<P>
<B>FINDING A ROBOT'S &quot;SIGNATURE&quot;</B>
</P>
<P>
Each cord is then pulled from the encoder and attached to the robot end-effector
interface, which has already been attached to the robot faceplate or tool. Once
the cords are in position, Robotrak uses the length of each cord to determine
the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the robot end-effector, essentially becoming a
Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM).
</P>
<P>
The robot is then moved through 50 points in space, and at each point the
Workspace software records the robot's position through the three Robotrak
encoders. Over the length of the test, as many joints as possible should be
moved. The points can either be taught manually with a teach pendant, or
generated in Workspace and downloaded into the robot controller. This teachpoint
file can then be kept in the controller for any future time when the robot may
need to be re-calibrated.
</P>
<P>
Once the points have been recorded, Workspace will compare the measured
positions (where the robot actually was) with the teachpoints (where the robot
thought it was), and the errors associated with the kinematics of the robot are
extracted and stored within Workspace. Errors which are detected include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The zero position of each joint (where the values of the joint variables is
zero).
</LI>
<LI>The length of each link and the distance offset at each link.
</LI>
<LI>The compliance at each joint.
</LI>
<LI>Robotrak will also calculate the tool offset if a tool is attached to the
robot.
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>
Once these errors are calculated, the kinematics of the robot model in Workspace
are modified to account for the differences between the real robot and the robot
model A filter is then used within Workspace to modify the teachpoint file so
that they represent actual positions on the real-world robot controller.
Programs can then be generated by Workspace that will be precise, sending the
robot to the correct position in real space.
</P>
<P>
<B>CALIBRATING A WORKCELL</B>
</P>
<P>
Positions of fixtures and other peripheral equipment within a workcell can also
be measured and merged into Workspace, allowing for the calibration of an entire
workcell Even individual stations within a rotating fixture can be measured to
take into account any errors between stations, or errors in the rotation of a
fixture. In essence, this is using the power of the Workspace software to make
any of the adjustments for inaccurate robots and the less accurate positioning
of equipment by calibrating the workcell once the equipment is in place. The
time and money spent getting the robot and fixtures precisely into place is
reduced.
</P>
<P>
The entire calibration process takes less than one hour per robot, including the
time it takes to set up the encoder units and calibrate them
</P>
<P>
However, the need to calibrate does not end once a workcell is set-up. If a
robot crashes during it's operation and bends a tool, Robotrak can be very
helpful. By setting up Robotrak and recording only a few points, the new  tool
offset can be determined. Then, through Workspace, the program can be
re-simulated to look for any collisions (using the collision detection feature
in Workspace) that may take place with the workpiece or a fixture. If there are
no collisions, the tool may be able to be used until the end of a shift,
limiting down-time. Also, as a robot ages, gear backlash and wear increase the
errors in a robot. By periodically re-calibrating a robot, the operator cam be
assured that any programs written for that robot will work.
</P>
<P>
Off-line programming can be of great value to a manufacturing firm. It allows
the robot to continue to operate while the program is being written, allows for
greater flexibility when writing programs, and more control over a process.
Interchangeability of programs between robot cells gives manufacturers
flexibility in scheduling and equipment utilization. Unless the robot is
calibrated, the program becomes little more than a guide to the robot operator
who will have to re-teach the entire program if it is too far off from what is
needed. Robotrak, along with Workspace, is the solution to this problem, and it
allows off-line programming to live up to its expectations.
