<P>
The Marine Science Institute, in continuous use by resident research
staff since 1946, is the oldest marine laboratory on the Texas
Gulf Coast. After a modest beginning as a series of wooden structures,
The University of Texas at Austin has invested steadily in the
facility including major modern steel-and-concrete laboratory
construction phases in 1961, 1973, and 1974. The latest building
complex, completed in 1983, comprises an auditorium, library,
and visitor's center. The construction of a new research pier
in 1994 provides air-conditioned laboratory space over the Aransas
Pass tidal inlet. The pier is only a short walk from the main
laboratory buildings.</P>
<P>
The Institute is located in Port Aransas, Texas at the north end
of a barrier island and adjacent to the Aransas Pass tidal inlet,
which connects the Gulf of Mexico with a vast system of estuaries.
Within easy reach of the Institute are diverse marine and estuarine
environments of interest to researchers in many fields of scientific
endeavor. These environments include the open Gulf of Mexico beyond
the slope/shelf break, the shallow waters of the continental shelf
and the bays and lagoons behind the barrier islands. The Institute
is within a few hundred meters of both the Gulf beach and an extensive
estuarine/lagoon system. Within this estuarine system is a wide
variety of accessible habitats including <I>Spartina</I> and mangrove
marshes, oyster reefs, shallow mud-bottom bays and the most extensive
seagrass meadows in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. In addition,
the regions to the north and south comprise one of the largest
lagoon systems in the world. They span a range of rainfall that
produces a salinity gradient from nearly fresh at the Louisiana
border to extremely hypersaline near the Mexican border. The region
is also the center of economically important fisheries, gas and
oil production, and marine-related tourism.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Research_program">Research Programs</A></H3>

<P>
Active research programs in marine science disciplines including
the physiology, biochemistry and ecology of marine plants and
animals; biological, chemical and physical oceanography; geochemistry;
mariculture; biochemical toxicology; and environmental monitoring,
have been established at the Institute for many years. Field oriented
projects focus on both the local environment and diverse sites
around the world. The Marine Science Institute staff totals 120
individuals including faculty, research scientists and associates,
postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and technical and support
staff. The Department of Marine Science is the academic arm of
the Marine Science Institute with 14 faculty members and 5 Professors
Emeritus. Courses are taught primarily at the Institute in both
the summer session and the long term. Graduate research is concentrated
at the Institute.</P>

<P>
The Institute's 83,000 sq. ft. central complex is located on 72
acres of beach-front land and consists of a series of interconnected
buildings containing laboratories, classrooms, televideo instruction
room, offices, a library, museum, exhibit halls, visitor's center,
auditorium, seminar rooms, and workshops. A 10,000 sq. ft. wet-laboratory
is supplied with filtered running seawater. Other structures on
the grounds of the Institute include 9,500 sq. ft. of dormitories,
a cafeteria, physical plant complex, garages, greenhouses, walk-in
freezers, and several outdoor pool/habitat tanks. The five-acre
boat basin provides quick access for our research vessels to both
the bay systems and the Gulf of Mexico. A new research pier allows
direct access for research projects in the Aransas Pass tidal
inlet connecting the Gulf with the bays. This 300 foot pier has
a 1200 sq. ft. lab at its base and a 150 sq. ft. instrument room
on the end. The terminus of the pier and instrument room house
a weather station, tide gauge, current meter, and sensors for
water temperature and salinity, all of which are transmitted to
real time data displays in the Visitor's Center and main laboratory.
The pier also has an electric winch for deploying sampling equipment
such as plankton nets and large-mesh tide traps to study fluxes
of biota through the inlet. A mile west of the main building complex,
the Fisheries and Mariculture Laboratory (FAML) occupies 26,000
sq. ft. of buildings on 10 acres adjacent to the ship channel.
This facility includes four large laboratories which provide for
temperature and photoperiod control. The FAML complex provides
facilities for research on spawning and rearing of marine finfish
and crustaceans and affords unique opportunities for research
utilizing captive animals. Both the main laboratories and the
FAML facility have office and laboratory space available for visiting
scientists.</P>

<STRONG>The Marine Science <A NAME="Library">Library</A></STRONG>
(MSL) is a branch library of the General Libraries and has more
than 50,000 volumes and is the primary source of marine related
information on the Gulf of Mexico. The fields covered include:
aquaculture/mariculture, biological and physical oceanography,
ichthyology, marine botany, marine chemistry, marine biochemistry
and geochemistry, marine ecology, marine geology, marine microbiology,
marine toxicology, respiratory and reproductive physiology of
marine animals, and the new field of marine viruses. MSL is particularly
strong in holdings of unpublished documents and reports on Texas
coastal resources. University faculty, staff, and students (UT
ID required) have access to interlibrary services, to on-line
bibliographic and abstracting services, and to UT-Austin Academic
Computing and Instructional Technology Services' mainframe computer
systems via remote-job-entry terminals. Persons not affiliated
with the University have acccess to the library's collections
via on-site visits, interlibrary services, and telephone reference.</P>
<P>
The <A HREF="hornspec.htm">R/V LONGHORN </A>is the largest of
the Institute's research vessels. The ship was modified in a major
refit in 1986 to give her an overall length of 105 ft. and is
equipped to carry out extensive offshore research. The LONGHORN
is currently a UNOLS vessel and is used in numerous NSF sponsored
projects throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The <A HREF="katy.htm">R/V KATY </A>is
a 57 ft. fiberglass trawler used in bay operations and is augmented
by a fleet of eleven 16-34 ft. research vessels used primarily
for estuarine studies. Four wheel drive and other vehicles are
available to provide access to coastal habitats.</P>

The Marine Science Institute is an organized research unit of
The University of Texas at Austin. The Institute's director reports
to the Provost of the University through the Dean of the College
of Natural Sciences. The Institute receives an operating budget
annually that is based on a two-year advanced budget approval
by the state legislature. Most research funds are based on grant
and contract research. Institute scientists have been awarded
133 research grants totaling over $11.8 million since 1990. These
awards have come from over 40 agencies and institutions including
$2.5 million from various NSF programs and have resulted in over
330 publications in refereed journals and numerous other articles
and reports. Institute scientists are engaged in both multi-investigator,
multi-disciplinary studies and individual research projects in
the local area and throughout the world. Many of these projects
are combinations of field and laboratory investigations. Funding
sources are acknowledged in all publications which appear in both
scientific journals and magazine and newspaper articles. While
the name of the University or the Institute cannot be used in
advertising, the funding agency or company can list and describe
funded projects in annual reports and other publications</P>
<H3><A NAME="Outreach"><STRONG>Public outreach</STRONG></A></H3>

<P>
In addition to research usage, the Institute serves as a marine
educational center for the region. Upper-level undergraduate and
graduate courses are taught in residence during the summer sessions,
typically involving 35-50 students from Texas and other states.
The Institute typically offers three courses during each of the
two summer sessions. The Department of Marine Science began offering
advanced degrees in 1991. Since then, enrollment has increased
by 6-8 students per year to the current enrollment of 34 students.
Enrollment in the Department is expected to continue increasing
over the next two years to about 40, a target that has been established
as an ideal &quot;carrying capacity&quot; for the Department.
The recent increase in graduate student enrollment in the department
has allowed Institute faculty to begin offering courses on-site
during the fall and spring semesters. Graduate students reside
in Port Aransas for thesis and dissertation research, supervised
by one or more of the resident staff, sometimes in collaboration
with other UT Austin faculty members on the main campus. In addition,
the Institute was designated as a site for NSF's &quot;Research
Experiences for Undergraduates&quot; program in 1994. The program
supports 10 undergraduates each summer, with an emphasis on minority
students. As part of the Marine Education Services program, the
Institute serves a large number of outside groups, primarily high
school and college classes, who visit the Institute during the
year. Hands-on teacher workshops are also provided. The total
number of visitors to take advantage of the Marine Education Services
program now exceeds 10,000 teachers and students annually. </P>
