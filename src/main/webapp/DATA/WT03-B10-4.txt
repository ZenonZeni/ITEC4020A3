PC, GAME AND MULTIMEDIA HAVEN'T WRITTEN OFF CES YET

     But it's close.  Only a few suppliers have chosen to display
their wares at Winter Consumer Electronics Show (WCES).

     IBM is biggest computer-related company with products on
display.  Hardware from consumer Aptiva line will be shown, as will
software from its Multimedia Publishing Studio.  "We're going to
have a large booth," spokeswoman said.  Although CES no longer is
hot show from multimedia standpoint, attendance totals alone make
event worth attending, she said.  "They feel like there is still a
large draw to CES," she said.  Still, company is almost apologetic
about its presence.  "It's not a big launch," she said.  "We're
setting up a booth and demoing a lot of new products and having a
presence."

     As exhibitor, IBM is in tiny minority of multimedia hardware
and software companies.  Even though Packard Bell and others have
exhibited, it looks as though Compaq will be only other major PC
supplier in Las Vegas.  As for software, Microsoft will have hotel
rooms but no floor presence.  And small players such as Goodtimes
Interactive, which presented at last year's WCES, are almost
completely absent.

     Multimedia companies said CES just doesn't work as platform
for them any more.  "We painfully exhibited at the last summer
CES," High Technology Distribution Pres. Perry Solomon said.  High
Technology sells variety of computer memory products, including
recordable CD-ROM drives, through its Smart & Friendly unit.  "I
grew up in the consumer electronics industry, and we certainly feel
that the consumer electronics channel is a valid one for our
products," he said.  "But we're not 100% sure that the Winter CES
is an appropriate forum."  For Smart & Friendly, must shows are
Winter Comdex and CeBit in Hamburg, Solomon said.

     One show rules on entertainment software side:  Los Angeles
Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), coming in spring.  Although
only in 2nd year, E3 has secure position as top software forum in
U.S. for videogame and PC entertainment software, robbing CES of
its largest combined exhibitor category.  "We'll be at E3,"
Microsoft Senior Group Mktg. Mgr. Marty Taucher said.  "We've got
a fairly substantial space in the main hall."

     That doesn't mean Microsoft -- or Smart & Friendly, for that
matter -- is writing off WCES completely.  "It's not clear to us
whether CES will have a big role for us in the future, but we'd
like to keep our options open," Taucher said.  "We'll be at suites
and doing meetings, but we won't have a floor presence."

     Smart & Friendly's main market is business users, Solomon
said.  But PC products are evolving so that eventually they will be
consumer electronics products, he said.  That's why he's taking a
"wait-and-see" attitude with WCES.  He hoped show would regain some
of its multimedia strength but isn't certain it will.  Summer CES's
decline as major show was very upsetting, he said.  "I've attended
so many CESes over so many years, and to watch a show that was so
strong and so powerful die was painful to me," he said.  "It proves
you've got to stay close to the market all the time.  I don't know
what happened, but somehow it lost its course."

     In attempt to provide some multimedia energy to mix, CES has
added 2 seminars to workshop:  "Multimedia Software Distribution: 
The New Model" and "Multimedia:  What Is the Consumer Looking For." 
Other panels already scheduled include "The Desktop PC Market --
What Consumers Want," computer manufacturer executive panel and
"Riding the Consumer Interactive Wave."  Strangely, Compaq
Pres.-CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer is show's keynote speaker.

FEW SURPRISES IN SPECIFICS FOR UNIFIED 'DVD' FORMAT

     New unified high-density optical disc format will be called
"DVD" and will feature Dolby AC-3 digital audio for NTSC markets,
MPEG audio for PAL and SECAM countries.

     Those were highlights of mid-Dec. announcement that
negotiators for former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) and Super Density (SD)
had completed work in Tokyo on technical specifications of unified
DVD format for PC ROM and home theater applications that's said to
combine best features of rival systems.  While agreement on
technical specs appeared to give green light to start
labor-intensive effort of designing final components for late-1996
launch, patent and licensing issues hadn't been addressed.  Philips
Key Modules Pres. Jan Oosterveld, company's key negotiator in
unification talks, said no fewer than 9 working groups had been
formed to hash out remaining administrative issues.  He refused to
project how long effort might take other than to say it would have
to be finished before products can be launched in 1996.

     Main specifications are same as those reported 3 months ago
when warring parties announced preliminary pact on unified standard
(CMR Sept 18 p1).  Basic disc is adapted from SD proposal for
bonded 5" media composed of 2 layers, each 0.6 mm thick.  Data
capacity is 4.7 gigabytes per side, using "RS-PC" error correction
system from SD proposal, "8-16" modulation system from MMCD
proposal.  System operates at average data transfer rate of 4.69
mbps.  Of 11 main technical points that comprise basic system,
Oosterveld said unified format draws equally from MMCD and SD
proposals.

     Unified system adopts Dolby AC-3 as mandatory choice in NTSC
countries for DVD digital audio, with MPEG audio as option. 
Reverse is true in PAL and SECAM markets.  Oosterveld said decision
using 2 digital audio systems in world heeds suggestions by movie
industry to adopt pattern consistent with disparity in TV standards
as means of controlling international distribution of home video
repertoire for copyright purposes.

     As for DVD name, briefing documents obtained by our affiliated
newsletter Audio Week said that while DVD is "formal name" of
unified format, "it is not meant to be an abbreviation for
anything, though in the past it stood for digital videodisc." 
Negotiators said "we believe the 'V' can also stand for
'versatile.'"  Documents said 9 companies "will now undertake
discussions in an effort to develop a patent licensing system." 
Companies listed are Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Philips,
Pioneer, Sony, Time Warner, Toshiba.  Roster didn't include
Thomson, which was described as having "worked closely on DVD
development" and "has expressed a desire to join the discussion."

     "From today on," statement said, "the companies supporting DVD
will propose and promote a wide range of applications for the
format.  They will continue to develop the technology and work to
position DVD optical discs as the ideal storage medium for the age
of multimedia."  Companies said they plan soon to announce logo for
use on all DVD movie players and ROM drives.  Oosterveld said
"competition" period officially has begun, meaning no formatwide
promotional booth is planned at Consumer Electronics Show or other
trade events.

     DVD "core" developers -- Philips, Sony, Matsushita and Toshiba
-- are expected to form joint corporation to administer DVD
patents.  Secondary tier of companies laying claim to inventions
incorporated into unified DVD standard would join patent pool. 
Toshiba sources in Tokyo told us Thomson had resisted proposal,
expressing preference to enforce own optical disc licenses. 
However, same sources said later that Thomson had tempered its
opposition to pool system in bid to project united industry front
in promoting DVD awareness before late-1996 launch.

     Negotiators tiptoed around questions on DVD video copy
protection, and briefing papers suggested only that variety of
"options are possible."  Sakon Nagasaki, dir. of Matsushita DVD
Promotion Office, told Tokyo news conference that he expects
adoption of Copy Generation Management System (CGMS), now being
developed by numerous companies.  He said CGMS would form basis of
legislation in U.S. based on proposal being negotiated by hardware
companies and movie industry.

     Copyright holders warned that unless protection issue is
settled, they won't put material on DVD.  "Our excitement for the
DVD format continues to grow," MCA Home Video Pres. Louis Feola
said.  "However, in the event there is not an encryption mechanism
that prevents all forms of copying, whether digital to digital or
digital to analog, we will in all likelihood not be supporting the
format," he told us.  He said acceptable DVD encryption system
"must be applied to all forms of hardware, including computers."

     In separate development, Thomson signed "multiproduct" OEM
deal with unnamed Japanese manufacturer covering "digital and
video" products, including DVD players that can be sold in U.S. as
low as $500 starting late in 1996, Exec. Vp Joseph Clayton said. 
Thomson is expected to identify Japanese partner at Las Vegas news
conference set for eve of this week's Consumer Electronics Show.

     DVD technology already is advancing.  Sanyo said it developed
new laser pickup capable of reading DVDs and conventional CDs. 
Dual-use red laser pickup, which will have output power of 5 mw,
will be built using DVD wavelength of 635 nanometers, one of 2
wavelengths specified in unified DVD format announced Dec. 8. 
Unlike existing dual-focus pickups requiring use of 2 lenses, Sanyo
device uses LCD shutter system to change characteristic of laser
needed for specific types of disc.  Sanyo said LCD method makes for
smaller and more reliable pickup.  Sample shipments will start in
March, Sanyo said.

DSS PRICING FOLLOWING CE ROUTE -- DOWN

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300 -- or even less -- consistent with traditional
consumer electronics pattern.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in
1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"
Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6
to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  To combat falling prices,
some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA and Sony DSS products
that promise 20-25% profit margins but slower sales.  Overall, 1995
unit sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected to
surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close to
million subscribers.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers,
who have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones where
hardware is offered to consumers virtually free and profits are
made on service.  Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar
hasn't released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware
retails could hit $500, with programming at $20.

     Lower retails are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba
and Uniden enter DSS this year, with Uniden already indicating it
may price product at $499-$549.  In addition to DSS, Alphastar and
Echostar plan to introduce own services, latter partnering with
Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE retail.  Even Primestar,
which primarily has leased equipment to consumers, has tested sales
through TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony piece recently broke
below suggested list price in Wiz ad at $648.

     DSS installation charge also has dropped in some markets to
$99 vs. $150 range when product was introduced in 1994.  Signs are
that pricing trends will gather momentum as market and number of
suppliers expands.  Two recent entrants provide examples:  Uniden
and AlphaStar.  Uniden will ship 2 DSS products by mid-1996 at
$499-$549, Exec. OEM Vp Hide Kanakubo said.  AlphaStar will launch
medium-power satellite service late in first quarter with product
at $600-$700 and sales limited to distributors and direct
marketers, Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein said.

     Uniden systems will sell in packages that include integrated
receiver decoder (IRD), 18" dish, low-noise blocker (LNB), remote
control.  Production is expected to begin in April, deliveries in
May, Kanakubo said.  Uniden has said it was considering hybrid
product compatible with C-band system as well as possibly building
IRD into other CE products.  First 2 models will be standalone
units, Kanakubo said.

     With Thomson's low-end RCA DSS product already appearing
advertised at $499, Uniden will have to hit lower retails, Kanakubo
said.  "The expectation at retail is that Uniden will be priced
lower than RCA or Sony," he said.  Lower prices could cross $400
barrier in 1996, industry observers said.  To differentiate itself
in market that also is expected to include Toshiba by mid-1996,
Uniden will sell products through satellite distributors and CE
retailers, Kanakubo said.

     Companies are taking variety of approaches to avoid dealing
with margin-slashing consumer electronics market.  Alphastar is
avoiding retail channel, relying on combination of Amway, satellite
distributors and multilevel marketing.  Company will sell single
IRD with 30" dish and remote control to satellite dealers through
distributor O'Rourke Bros. and to consumers through Amway and
multilevel marketer United Digital Bcstg. Corp.  Programming will
be sold in packages at $24-$49, with some consisting of 40 video
and 30 audio channels.  Premium pay packages and a la carte
channels will retail at $4.95-$14.95 per month, 16 PPV channels at
$2.99 per movie.

     Full 120-channel service, to be available within 2-3 weeks of
launch, will consist of 85 video, 30 audio and 3-5 data services. 
IRD contains RS-232 port to connect to PC to download data services
as well as gain access to Internet, Klippenstein said.  IRD also
will use MPEG-2 data transmission and have LED.

     Tightly focused marketing is key to AlphaStar's approach,
Klippenstein said.  "We're targeting specific customer bases rather
than going with a mass market approach that requires huge inputs of
advertising, media, and consumer electronics distribution," he
said.  Giveaway DSS systems are almost inevitable, Klippenstein
said.  "I would think that for this product the equipment would
pass the cost curve much more rapidly than the marketing cost of
attracting a subscriber," he said.  "When that happens it makes
sense to give the box away because the long-term value is in the
subscription and the ongoing revenue that comes from that
subscription."

FATALITIES THREATENED IN CHINA PIRACY WAR

     Sums involved in hardware and software piracy are spurring
threats of physical harm in China, where illegal videogame console
total rivals legal units in U.S.

     War of words over piracy is threatening to turn into real
thing, as videogame cartridge and console and CD-ROM software
contraband markets explode.  "The gray market is our biggest
competitor worldwide," said executive with one leading videogame
company.

     China is leading violator on both CD-ROM and videogame fronts
-- but Eastern Europe is working hard to catch up.  There are 297
CD and CD-ROM plants in world, of which 30 are in China, and
pirated copies represent 59% of China's CD market, according to
London-based International Federation of Phonographic Industry
(IFPI).  Relatively new area for piracy is Bulgaria, with 4 CD
production lines in 3 plants.  Until Sept. 6, when 2 long-standing
European copyright conventions came into effect in Bulgaria, there
was no protection for foreign recordings, so all 3 plants were
producing unauthorized copies.  That situation is beginning to
change, copyright activists report. 

     One sign of intensity of struggles was recent temporary
shutdown of IFPI's Guangzhou, China, office.  "We've heard through
somebody that contract killers have been employed," said IFPI
Communications Dir. Catrin Hughes.  Leads were "pretty solid," she
said.  "It's not the sort of thing you take a chance on."  IFPI
offices in Beijing and Shanghai remain open, and Canton office will
go back on line as soon as threat is resolved, she said.  This
isn't first time IFPI has had to shut down office -- in recent
years, threats forced temporary closures in Thailand and Taiwan. 
"We reopened in Taiwan, and now we've cleaned up the market,"
Hughes said.

     While CD-ROM piracy snares spotlight, black market videogame
cartridge activity is soaring.  Almost nonissue as recently as
1988, cartridge piracy is costing publishers at least $1-$1.5
billion annually, said Nintendo of America (NOA) Gen. Counsel Lynn
Hvalsoe.  Aggressive legal efforts have stunted counterfeit sales
in U.S., but unlawful products are rampant in Asia and Latin
America, she said.  At close to 20 million, total number of illegal
Nintendo Super Entertainment System (SNES) consoles in China equals
installed base in U.S.  Estimates of total number of counterfeit
Nintendo cartridges sold in China come to 100 million units or
more, she said.

     CD-ROM and game cartridge pirate situations are fundamentally
different because of media used by 2 formats.  For one, while China
is producer of pirate CD-ROM product, it's primarily consumer of
counterfeit videogames.  There are almost 300 CD-ROM plants
worldwide, but just 12 can produce high-density read-only memory
chips used in videogame cartridges.  Most of those are in Japan, S.
Korea, Taiwan.

     Sophisticated pirates don't just duplicate games, they
reproduce artwork as well, Hvalsoe said.  Difference between
legitimate and pirate box often is little more than lighter
contrast on illegal copy, and sometimes fake name.  That makes
antipiracy activities in developed and undeveloped countries far
more difficult, she said.

     "They copy both trademarked and copyrighted material," Hvalsoe
said.  Getting data out of cartridges is relatively easy;  all it
takes is fairly inexpensive E-PROM or ROM reader.  Nintendo invests
significant amounts of time and money encrypting its games to make
life more difficult for pirates, but such strategies don't work
against determined assault.  "We do have some pretty sophisticated
copy protection," she said, but "we know that no matter how
sophisticated our copy protection is, the pirates will find a way
to get around it."

     There are numerous ways to detect even well-made pirate
product, Hvalsoe said:  (1) Print quality, since even good boxes
are simply copies of old ones.  (2) Product quality, because
pirates often use glue rather than screws to hold game cartridges
together.  (3) Company names, since many suppliers put false names
even on realistic artwork.  (4) Price, since counterfeit cartridges
usually are priced far below legitimate ones.

     Going after chipmakers themselves isn't easy.  Although plants
are few, strategies for disguising chips are many.  Intensive
detective activities are required to ferret out where illegal
copies were made.  Taking action against chip manufacturers also is
difficult.  "We've not had success in Korea or Taiwan suing
people," Hvalsoe said.  So Nintendo is taking advantage of Lanham
Act, which allows companies to sue offshore manufacturers in U.S.
courts if their products are being used illegally.  Most major chip
producers have significant activity and assets in U.S., so actions
taken here can have significant impact overseas, she said.

     Pricing is another defensive strategy.  In China, Nintendo is
selling product "at a significantly reduced value," Hvalsoe said,
with cartridges selling for 50% or more off U.S. price and with
many games going for just $20-$30.  Yet illegitimate games still
win price competition.  In China, taking legal action just doesn't
seem to work, she said.  "When someone's selling hundreds of
thousands of games, they might fine them $100," she said.

     Latin America is another hotbed of pirate sales, Hvalsoe said. 
"We've seen a tremendous amount of activity in Panama and also
Paraguay," she said.  Company is mounting intensive antipiracy
education campaign aimed at Latin American Customs officials. 
Nintendo also is pushing for aggressive legal action against Latin
American pirates.  Hundreds of thousands of cartridges were seized
recently in Panamanian Free Trade Zone.

     Living up to its reputation as intensely litigious company,
Nintendo has several hundred suits pending worldwide, Hvalsoe said. 
Company is working with International Intellectual Property
Alliance and other organizations to try to beat back tide of
unlawful product.  Most successful efforts seem to be in U.S.,
where game piracy seems virtually dormant.

     Even antipiracy action can have twist in China.  China
Foundation for Consumer Protection has created prize to encourage
consumer action against bootleg goods, and recently awarded 5,000
yuan ($600) to Wang Hai.  But award was very controversial, since
many felt Wang was unfairly exploiting China's Law on Protection of
Consumers' Rights and Interests.  That law requires that stores
compensate customers for twice the value of fake products returned. 
Wang was accused of knowingly purchasing fake products and
returning them for double-price refund.

STANDARDIZED TELCO AND CABLE WIRING COMING

     Compatibility between wires used by telcos and cable operators
should be on way soon, thanks to new FCC proceeding.  Commission
launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home wiring rules
between telcos and cable.  Rulemaking will deal with demarcation
between customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal leakage and
quality, technical standards, customer-premises equipment (CPE),
division of state and federal responsibilities.

     FCC Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendous
competitive advantage" for incumbent, and new rules could make
cable CPE market as competitive as telephone equipment market.

     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point would
be appropriate, acknowledging it might be different for
single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'
broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage and
signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should have
to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcos
have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatory
distinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring as
telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-home
broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divide
regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,
states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation of
telephony and video programming.

     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should have
same rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customers
have.  It said it believes that it may be appropriate to deregulate
cable equipment rates after market becomes competitive and after
transition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whether Commission
has authority to deregulate equipment rates.

     Commission rejected petitions for reconsideration filed by
Nynex and others asking to move demarcation point between
customer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multiple dwelling
units.  Comr. Chong said demarcation point, currently 12" outside
subscriber premises, often isn't accessible to competitors, so it
reduces likelihood of competition.  Agency did set rulemaking to

16-BIT GAMES HOLD SHARE AMID 64-BIT BATTLES

     "Old-fashioned" 16-bit videogame systems probably will hold on
to major market share even in 1996 as manufacturers wage war of
words, titles and marketing dollars over high-powered new
technology.

     Sparking latest contretemps were comments by 3DO Chmn. William
(Trip) Hawkins that internal "bus" structure of Nintendo Ultra 64
would severely limit performance of system overall and was like
"squeezing a fire hose into a garden hose."

     "That's bull," said Nintendo of America Sales & Mktg. Exec. Vp
Peter Main.  At issue is ability of Nintendo system to move
information from one part of machine to another.  Some portions of
Nintendo machine use 32-bit bus structure.  Hawkins says that will
limit system performance.  Main and Nintendo engineers say it
won't.  What's clear is that 64-bit battles definitely will end up
dominating media coverage and high-end videogame scene -- but
perhaps not dollar volume.

     Introduction of Ultra 64 in Japan is absolute lock for April
21, Main said.  Picture in U.S. is far fuzzier, with potential
launch dates in May-Aug. range.  Some observers are betting on
spring launch themed on Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in L.A. 
If that's to be case, Nintendo will have to resort to some fast ad
footwork.  In visit last week to company's Redmond, Wash., hq, we
were told that no ads had been placed in game fan periodicals, even
though deadlines were drawing near.  Another sign that Ultra may
come later rather than sooner:  Despite flying half-dozen
journalists to Redmond, Nintendo could show only Ultra 64
videotape, not game itself.

     One thing is sure:  1995 was tough year for videogame
industry, Nintendo included.  "This year was called the great year
of confusion," Main said.  One big challenge is that primary
audience -- boys 8-12 years old -- is becoming more choosy than
ever and willing to skip products that don't offer dramatic edge in
performance and game play.  "We're dealing with 8-12-year-olds
acting like 35-40-year-olds in terms of savvy," Main said.  That
has resulted in good and bad news for Nintendo;  software sales
have been strong, but company's new hardware introduction, Virtual
Boy, is struggling so hard that company is planning "relaunch" in
U.S. and Japan.

     "It was the year of hits, not bits," Main said, with winner
determined by "who is going to have the greatest content."  He
pointed to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country 2 as both hit and good
software product.  "Even while other software is selling at at best
60% to 70% of last year's totals, this one has worldwide demand of
110% to 120%," he said.  One sign that strength of 16-bit market
caught Nintendo as well as most of rest of videogame market by
surprise is the fact that DKC2 is sold out on global basis.  Main
predicted 16-bit strength would continue to lesser degree through
1996.  "At this time next year, [16-bit] is going to represent 35%
to 40% of the videogame market," he said.

     While Donkey Kong may be doing well, rest of videogame market
isn't setting any records.  Projections were that game market would
be down 5% to 20%, Main said.  He thinks total decline will be
10-12%, with U.S. videogame dollar volume at $3.8-$3.9 billion. 
Once counted out, 16-bit products represent 2/3 of that, he said. 
Market share of 16-bit games has declined to 66% of total sales in
1995 from 77% last year.  Hand-held market share also slumped, down
to 15-16% this year from 25% last year.  That still represents
significant volume.  "We've got 19 million Game Boys sold," Main
said.  "This year we'll be moving 5.7 million pieces."

     New technology, including 32-bit games and Virtual Boy,
account for fraction of total market, 19%, Main said.  He estimated
that fewer than one million 32-bit consoles would be sold.  Of that
number, Sony's Playstation accounted for 400,000-500,000, Sega's
Saturn 200,000, 3DO 150,000 and with Atari's Jaguar and other
devices accounting for rest.  By contrast, 16-bit Super Nintendo
Entertainment system sold 2.4 million, he said.  Virtual Boy's
sales were far under expectations, Main admitted:  "It's been a
long year for Virtual Boy in the U.S."  Even though 3D game playing
units have sold far under expectations, "we are not finished with
Virtual Boy," Main said.

     Nintendo has sold 400,000 Virtual Boys in U.S., 250,000 in
Japan, he said.  Games released for unit just scratch surface of
its unique capabilities, Main said.  In Japan, "they are planning
to relaunch the product in February," he said, with similar
relaunch in U.S.  "It has not seen its full potential.  It's going
to have another round."

     One area Nintendo isn't planning to explore is CD-ROM
videogames.  Cost structures in CD-ROM market benefit
manufacturers, not consumers, Main said.  When it comes to adding
bulk memory capacity to Ultra 64, Nintendo will stick with
recordable magnetic disc that company has already announced, he
said.  Disc will move at 8 times CD-ROM speed, he said.  Position
may leave Nintendo vulnerable when DVD hits market, since competing
M-2 and Sony Playstation systems reportedly will be able to play
back DVD discs with relatively simple upgrade.  Signs are that
Ultra 64, with its proprietary magnetic discs, won't have that
capability.

FORMAT WARS LOOM OVER DVD MUSIC CAPABILITIES

     Software and hardware companies are moving to carve out slices
of potentially vast DVD music market.  It looks as though format
war that was avoided over video DVD will erupt on sound side.

     Several entities are exploring DVD music potential -- or
battling for different sound formats.  Engineering Committee of
Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA) has formed task force to
investigate applications of high-density music discs, Exec. Vp
David Leibowitz said.  Sony is showing hush-hush technology called
Direct Stream Digital (DSD) that will form backbone of its proposal
for adapting DVD disc for ultra-high-fidelity music applications. 
And Pioneer and Philips are touting their own DVD music solutions.

     Sony claimed DSD will deliver frequency response up to 100 kHz
and dynamic range better than 120dB, on ground that any new music
proposal will have to represent "quantum leap" in sonic performance
from existing CD if it's to succeed.  Sony executives are
describing system as "radical departure" from linear PCM technology
used in existing CD system.  Beauty of DSD, they said, is that
system is "scalable" for variety of future archival or digital
delivery applications.

     DVD discs will hold 100 min. of 2-channel stereo music, Sony
Software Dir.-Sound Technology Mktg. David Kawakami said.  He said
DSD also can be adapted easily for multichannel music-only
applications.  He said Sony is confident 4.7-Gb DVD would be
capable of holding at least 74 min. of multichannel music, same
capacity as existing audio CD.

     Sony DSD proposal already has drawn sharp attacks.  DSD also
is likely to face competition from other proponents such as Philips
and Pioneer, which are developing their own systems.  Little is
known about Philips' PCM-based proposal, which is believed to carry
working name OmniDisc, and puts strong emphasis on multichannel
capabilities.  Pioneer had been floating proposal within SD
Alliance for 2-stage DVD music application, touting 24-bit, 96-kHz
oversampling.

     DSD wasn't only source of DVD music battles.  Dolby Labs
predictably welcomed word that unified DVD format includes AC-3
audio as mandatory standard for NTSC markets and optional system
for PAL and SECAM countries.  But usually staid and conservative
licensor also took opportunity to remove gloves and attack Philips
for week-earlier claims that MPEG audio is "superior" to AC-3 in
sound quality and future upgradability.  In criticizing Philips
claims, Dolby Vp Edward Schummer was referring to report quoting
Philips spokeswoman as saying MPEG has been found to have better
sound quality than AC-3 in comparative listening tests her company
has run.  She also said MPEG audio has future upgradability for
7.1-channel surround.

     Because MPEG multichannel audio decoder chips aren't "readily
available," Dolby said in report, "it is assumed" that consumer
hardware would be based at start on 2-channel devices.  Two-step
strategy of introducing DVD audio as "stereo today, multichannel
tomorrow" means that "limitations" of MPEG audio "can remain
largely unknown until some time in the future, long after the
decision [adopting system for DVD] has been made," Dolby said.

     Choosing DVD audio standard for unified specs once had been
described as "minor issue" when former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) and
Super Density (SD) alliances announced preliminary truce agreement
3 months ago.  However, debate between adopting MMCD-supported MPEG
audio and SD-endorsed AC-3 system appears to have gone down to
wire, reportedly because Philips -- in breaking with Sony -- had
been lobbying heavily, to no avail, for worldwide adoption of MPEG
as mandatory DVD sound system.

     While Dolby was depicting AC-3 as winner in DVD derby, real
loser was DTS, which had ridden Matsushita's coattails and won
designation from now-moot SD Alliance as optional DVD sound system
in NTSC markets along with mandatory choice of AC-3.

HOTELS AND AIRLINES EMERGING AS VIDEOGAME MARKETS

     Systems that allow consumers to play videogames in hotel rooms
and while they're flying are beginning to achieve significant
market penetration.

     At least 200,000 hotel rooms are equipped with game play
capability for Nintendo products alone, said Nintendo of America
(NOA) Engineering Dir. Russel Braun.  Penetration is fairly
significant, since there are about 1.6 million hotel rooms in U.S.,
of which only about 800,000 are in facilities upscale enough to
want to provide gaming service.  "Real discount chains won't want
to add amenities like this," he said.

     Airlines have lot further to go.  About 35,000 seats have game
capability, Braun said, on such airlines as Cathay Pacific,
Singapore Airlines, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, China Air. 
One reason for slower progress:  Cost.  Expense of installing
system comes to about $1.5 million per plane, and weight is equal
to that of 4 passengers.  But payoff can be dramatic -- Cathay
calculated that if it gets just 2 more passengers per plane,
additional revenues will come to $1 million.

     On airplanes, each seat has own screen, mounted using flexible
shaft.  Besides videogames, screens can carry movies and public
service announcements.  Consumer reception so far seems strong,
with one caveat:  Seatmates sometimes object to language used by
struggling game players.

     Instead of selling game services directly to hotels, Nintendo
works through distributors of pay-TV systems.  "They put it in the
hotel and they manage it," Braun said.  Game systems will work only
in hotels with pay-TV systems;  when such systems are installed,
it's possible to get game play technology up and running for only
$35-$50 per room.  That's because system is centralized -- each
room has only game controller, with single main unit handling game
play activity.

     Relatively small game system can handle fairly large hotel,
since in average hotel of 100 rooms only about 20 TV sets will be
on.  Current record for continuous hotel game play:  12 hours at
one stretch.  Bill for play was reportedly far more than bill for
stay, but customer reportedly paid without whimper. 

     Hotels don't pay for installation, pay-TV distributors do. 
Hotels then get 10% of game revenue.  Consumers can select any one
of 10 videogames and pay $4.95 per hour.  Selection can be changed
relatively easily, but switch requires in-person visit by cable
operator.  Most popular Nintendo game is Super Mario World.  Vast
majority of hotel rooms are in U.S., but providers are staging
aggressive push for other countries.  U.K. opened up last month; 
plans are to enter Japan in Jan., with Brazil on list for 1996 as
well.

TOUGH TIMES FOR BIG RETAILERS

     By and large, few retailers cheered holiday season, but stores
that specialized in broader product lines seemed to face most
difficult struggles.  Some chains are trying to make comebacks from
the near dead.  Others are battling to avoid extinction themselves.

     Biggest victim of rough retail era is K mart, which staved off
immediate threat of bankruptcy in late Dec. after reaching
agreement with creditors and eliminating common stock dividend. 
Creditors agreed to delay payments on $548 million in real estate
bonds.  Original terms called for K mart to pay sum back
immediately if its bond rating were cut to junk-bond level. 
Moody's has downgraded K mart senior debt to notch above junk bond. 
Retailer also eliminated 12 cents-per-share quarterly dividend that
could result in saving $220 million yearly.

     Tandy's Incredible Universe (IU) and Computer City (CC) are
expected to post losses this year.  Board authorized buyback of up
to 5 million shares in bid to ward off shareholder discontent
following collapse of stock to $37 from $64.  Tandy has battled to
improve operations of 2 of its chains, CC and IU, latter projected
by analysts to lose $11 million this year.  Stock buyback bid is
Tandy's 2nd following 12.5-million-share program in 1994.

     Another operation trying to make it back from brink is 47th
St. Photo.  Fresh from purchase by Tuttnauer, 47th St. Photo said
it's is planning possible public stock offering to open 2 new
stores in 1996.  N.Y.C. retailer, which will seek listing on
Nasdaq, will use money to open 15,000-sq.-ft. stores in Lower
Manhattan and Long Island, said Tut Services Pres.-CEO Stuart Held,
whose firm is holding company for 47th St.

     Stores would be first that 47th St. Photo has opened since
filing for bankruptcy in 1992.  Since then, chain, which once had
$300 million annual sales, closed 3 stores, including namesake on
47th St., but maintained 45th St. location.

     Plans include boost in PC market presence and catalog sales,
executives said.  47th St. will ship 6 catalogs in 1996 targeting
niches within photography and CE, Held said.  Mail order accounts
for 20% of sales, although plans are to expand it to 30-35%, he
said.  Held projected sales of $50-$60 million in 1996.  Company
also will boost presence in PCs, which represent 28-30% of sales. 
Held said:  "PCs have been ignored up until now because it took so
much money to go into that area, but now that we're starting to
settle our finances we will become aggressive again."

     Still another retailer expanding after trying time is Tops
Appliance City.  Tops, which has battled to bring finances into
line, said it has selected site in Brooklyn to open 60,000-sq.-ft.
store and will shift to full commission for sales staff in early
1996.  Brooklyn store would be N.J. chain's 9th.  Chain also has
sought to boost home office business, adding new fixtures in some
outlets to increase assortment of PC software and peripherals. 
Tops gradually has boosted amount of PC software its stores carry
since 1994 when it moved to 100 titles from 25.

     Experiencing relatively smooth growth is Tower Records, which
just expanded into Canada, opening 22,500-sq.-ft. store in Toronto. 
Store is stocked with 100,000 music CDs, 10,000 videos, laserdiscs
and CD-ROM titles, 14,000 books.  Tower operates 150 stores in 12
countries.

3-D DVD 'WALKMAN'

     A leading manufacturer of virtual reality glasses, Virtual iO,
is working with Matsushita to develop standard interconnections for
DVD portables to be used with eyegear displays for viewing movies
and other programs on the go, including 3D.

     "We're doing some work with DVD," said Linden Rhoads, pres.
and co-founder of Virtual iO, Seattle.  Company's glasses weigh
less than 1 lb. and display images on 0.7" LCD screens about 1"
from viewer's eyes.  Image is surprisingly clear, but also reveals
flaws, with pixels relatively visible.

     Since first shipments 7 months ago, Virtual has sold 40,000
pairs of glasses priced at $799, said Rhoads, who said company
projects sales of "several hundred thousand" in 1996, based on
expectation that cable networks will offer 3D shows next year. 
Video/DVD version of glasses at start will sell for $599, she said,
with prices going "down to $299 over the next couple of years," but
$199 and $99 probably aren't within reach because of costs.

     Rhoads said Virtual is working with Matsushita, which probably
will distribute its glasses in Japan.  Primary goal is to create
uniform plug that will carry audio, video and power over same line. 
As things stand, users would need separate battery pack to power
players and headgear.  Negotiations should result in "simple and
elegant" connector that does whole job with one cable, she said.

     Virtual iO glasses provide rough equivalent of NTSC quality. 
Recent deal with Planar Systems, Rhoads said, will let company make
leap from LCD displays to electroluminescent (EL) technology.  LCD
displays are limited effectively to 60,000 pixels, but EL displays
can make possible 350,000-pixel screen that should be available in
mid-1996, offering full Virtual Graphics Array (VGA) quality
resolution, with 500,000-pixel model on market in about year.

     Virtual iO's investors include TCI, Thomson CSF and Logitech,
Rhoads said, and company has exclusive deal to provide Sony with
virtual reality (VR) glasses for PlayStation, to be shipped in 1996
first quarter, she said.  Glasses will provide full 3D effect for
special 3D games.  Game glasses will feature "head tracking,"
turning images as user turns head, up, down or sideways.

     "Cybersickness" isn't issue, Rhoads said, referring to flaw
that has plagued all 3D video systems in past -- including
dizziness, nausea, headache.  But even some Virtual staffers say
they have experienced twinges with more intense VR games.  Another
potential health hazard -- walking into traffic while wearing
headgear -- won't be problem, she said.  Glasses have see-through
screens, and users are expected to use them while seated in buses,
at home or waiting in line.

     Besides working with CE companies, Virtual is negotiating with
voice recognition supplier, Rhoads said, on system allowing users
to control glasses with words rather than reaching for switch or
control.  When SVGA glasses go on market, she said, they could make
laptop PC screens obsolete.

although Wellington conceded company "probably won't be as active
with national advertising."  Philips will continue direct marketing
to current CD-I owners, expanding it to offer software from
publishers other than Philips Media.  New avenues include
CD-I-based Internet browser that will be available in U.S. in 6-9
months.  Browser, introduced in PAL version in U.K. in Sept., is
modem and software combination that includes 14.4 kbps modem that
plugs into CD-I player.  CD-I disc has communications software and
browser.

     Samsung Electronics has agreed to double AST Research's credit
line to $200 million and extend it for another year, giving
beleaguered PC maker breathing room.  In exchange, Samsung was
given 6th seat on AST's 11-member board and option to increase
stake in company to 45% from 40.25%.  Terms of new agreement are
more generous than one reached month ago when Samsung extended AST
$100-million credit line for one year.  Samsung also extended to 2
years from one an additional $100 million in credit for AST's
component purchases from company, which builds monitors, memory
chips, other key parts.  Samsung helped resolve cash crunch at AST
in Feb. when it bought 40.25% stake for $377.5 million.  However,
AST has remained unprofitable, posting $96.4 million loss in first
quarter ended Sept. 30.
