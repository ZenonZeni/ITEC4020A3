<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Six Myths That Can Rob You Of Your Retirement
Plans</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
Like many people, you may have thought about retirement planning without actually
doing as much as
you'd like to do - at least not yet.  Even if you have been financially preparing
and have amassed what
you think is an adequate retirement income, think again. Often, people will base
their retirement
estimates on several mistaken, but commonly-held, assumptions regarding retirement
and what
various
resources will provide.  In many cases, the reality of retirement turns out to be
quite different from what
these common "retirement myths" would lead one to believe.
<P>
<STRONG>1.	Myth: I'll have Social Security to support me.</STRONG>  <BR>
	Reality: Wrong.  Social Security was never designed to cover income needs, but
rather to
supplement your pension and personal savings.  Here's an idea of what you can
expect from Social
Security: if your annual earnings are $25,000, $40,000, $60,000, Social Security
can provide 50%,
27%, 23% of your annual income, respectively.<P>
At least, that's what you can expect if you retire now.  However, some experts have
estimated that by the
time today's working baby boomers are ready to retire next century, there may not
be enough people left
in the work force to fully fund Social Security benefits.  That's all the more
reason to look into building up
your retirement savings.
<P>
<STRONG>2.	Myth: My living costs will be lower when I retire, so I'll need less
money.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: Many times, just the opposite is true.  The only costs that may end
are mortgage payments
and the college tuition you may now be paying.  Health care costs could rise,
especially if you no longer
have employer-sponsored medical/dental coverage.  Also, many retirees frequently
eat out, which could
increase food bills.  And you'll probably want to pursue your favorite hobbies,
recreational activities, and
"dream" vacations.
<P>
<STRONG>3.	Myth: I'll have my company pension to tide me over.</STRONG>  <BR>
	Reality: Don't count on a pension as your main source of income.  Most defined 
benefit plans are geared toward providing a replacement ratio of between 40% - 60%
of your final
average salary.  This amount generally will be paid only if the employee has 25 or
more years of service
with the employer.  Also, defined benefit pensions are often reduced for payments
to Social Security. 
Under typical circumstances, the actual replacement ratio can drop to between 20%
and 30% of the
final average salary for a rank-and-file employee.  <P>
Naturally, each situation is different for each person.  But many retirees have
made the mistake of
counting on their pension, only to have to find part-time jobs to pay the bills. 
With the right planning, this
won't happen to you.
<P>
<STRONG>4.	Myth: I'm too old to begin planning for retirement now.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: Not true.  Maybe you can't make up for lost time and opportunity but
it's never too late to
start saving.  Someone who takes early retirement at age 55 may still be going
strong after 30 years. 
So, while you'll have to contribute more to your retirement savings account than if
you had started
earlier, you can still be ready for your retirement - if you start now, and do what
needs to be done.
<P>
<STRONG>5.	Myth: The equity in my home is my retirement fund.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: While a house may be your largest investment, residential real estate
does not always
appreciate.  Even when home prices do rise, they usually increase along with all
other living expenses. 
Even if you sell and move to a smaller home, you may wind up with far less money,
after paying capital
gains taxes, than you expected.  And, when all your savings have been depleted, you
can't sell your
house, piece by piece, in order to eat.  That's why it's important to have liquid
assets that will be there
when you need them.
<P>
<STRONG>6.	Myth: My main goal should be to preserve my savings.</STRONG><BR>
	Reality: Inflation is a money-killer, and it will deplete your principal.  To
stay ahead of inflation, you
shouldn't seek to preserve money, but to build on it.  Did you know that a
retirement income of $20,000
in 1970 would have to increase to $67,000 in 1990 to have the same purchasing
power?  A solid
financial plan allows your assets to grow, so that you can keep up with the rising
cost of living.
