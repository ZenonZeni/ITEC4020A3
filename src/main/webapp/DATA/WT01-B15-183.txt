Release of Department of the Navy Draft Environmental Impact Statement for a Container
System for the Management of Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel, May 1996</H2><HR>

<BODY>
<strong> SUMMARY:</strong> In an action related to the OCRWM program, on May 14, 1996, the Department of the Navy
(Navy) published an announcement in the <a href="http://gopher.nara.gov:/70/1/register/toc">Federal Register</a> entitled <b>"Notice of Availability of the
Department of the Navy Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a Container System for
the Management of Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel; and Announcement of Public Hearings" (61 FR
24293)</b>.  In this notice, the Navy announced the release of the Draft EIS for public comment. The
Department of Energy is a cooperating agency for this draft EIS.  In an earlier <a href="http://gopher.nara.gov:/70/1/register/toc">Federal Register</a>
published on December 7, 1995, (60 FR 62828) the Navy announced its plan to assume lead
responsibility for preparation of this EIS evaluating container systems for the management of
naval spent nuclear fuel. This EIS (previously titled Environmental Impact Statement for a
Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel) was
being prepared by OCRWM, with the Navy participating as a cooperating agency. In response to
budgetary constraints in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM halted its proposal to fabricate and deploy a
multi-purpose canister based system, and ceased preparation of the multi-purpose canister EIS,
which was to include both civilian and naval spent nuclear fuel.
