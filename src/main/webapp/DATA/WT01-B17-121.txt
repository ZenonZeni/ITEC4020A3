<P>


<tt>By JEESE HANLEY, M.D.</tt><p>



	Premenstrual syndrome and menopause are generally viewed as “curses,” but in my practice, I help women discover their “gifts.” PMS is a valuable opportunity to become more attuned to what’s going on inside yourself. When women can transform their relationship to their cycle, the hardship melts into increased sensitivity and clarity of direction and purpose. Similarly, I encourage women to regard menopause as the life change for which they have endured PMS and spent their lives preparing, to see it as an entrance, or initiation perhaps, into a new time of wisdom. <p>
	In my consultations with women who have PMS symptoms, I suggest they honor their feelings and appreciate that there is a purpose to these symptoms. PMS includes the symptoms that begin with or after ovulation and finish by the end of the menstrual flow. It’s known, perhaps misleadingly, as premenstrual syndrome because the majority of the symptoms and the longest period of these symptoms for most women come before menstruation. <p>
	<b>PMS</b> is actually valuable because it opens a window of increased sensitivity to pain and helps women to remember their wisdom. Technically, PMS is a sign that something is not working right, whether nutritionally,  hormonally, or psychologically.  By taking us to the brink each month, PMS becomes a wake-up call to correct these imbalances. When we attend to them, the result is a healthier life and deeper self-respect, as well as a preparation for a smooth transition through menopause. <p>
	<b>RESPECT YOUR PMS</b>. I strive to empower women to develop self-respect for their normal biological processes and womanhood. I encourage women to ask questions, to evaluate the possible  effects of trading a little comfort now for a long-term risk.<p>
	Regrettably, we’re a culture that doesn’t deal with things until they’re an emergency, especially  the health of a woman's body. Too often we wait until it’s a dreadful problem, such as fibroids, endometriosis, or cancer that might require surgery.  <p>
	Many women work in mainstream jobs where it is uncomfortable and unsafe for them to be fully, biologically, a woman. Birth control pills keep their hormones so even they barely have a noticeable monthly cycle except for minimal bleeding. Many women become almost addicted to not being a woman, to not understanding the natural cycling of hormones and the feelings, increased sensitivity, intuition, and creativity this evokes. It’s a kind of medical self-destruction that will surely create health problems. <p>
	There is an old concept that the uterus, the hyster, is the cause of “hysteria” in a woman, and that by removing it through a hysterectomy  a woman will become less emotional, more like a man and thus easier to control. Approximately 33% of American women will have a hysterectomy by age 60; about 600,000 are performed every year, but many of these are medically unnecessary.  Chinese medicine describes the uterus as the place where a woman's energy and essence reside, so we need to rethink our approach to uterine health. <p>
	<b>PMS</b> is a clustering of symptoms magnified by a hormonal imbalance. If you are truly healthy, the experience of menstruation will not  be so upsetting, biochemically or psychologically. But to get to this kind of health, you need to undo the effects of a series of obstacles. There are many human-made environmental chemicals, pesticides, and herbicides that masquerade as estrogen once they’re inside your body and thereby upset the delicate hormonal balance.<p>
	The message is this: heed what your premenstrual symptoms are telling you before you get sick from them.<p>
	<b>HOLD THE ESTROGEN</b>. Many of the reproductive problems women experience, including heavy bleeding, fibroids, fibrocystic breast disease, PMS, and many menopausal symptoms, are not a deficiency of estrogen, but instead an excess of estrogen relative to a deficiency of progesterone. There is a dramatic lack of understanding in mainstream medicine of this progesterone/estrogen imbalance and its significance and dangerous effect on female tissues. Consequently, women are not getting the help they need.<p>
	A perfect example is the way so many physicians immediately put women on estrogen replacement therapy the minute they start complaining about perimenopausal (on the verge of menopause) symptoms. It’s the wrong thing to do. Physicians do this with no hormonal monitoring. I've only met one patient in my years of practice whose physician actually measured her hormone level after giving female hormones to her. <p>
	There are natural, safe, and healthy alternatives to birth control pills,  hysterectomies, and estrogen replacement therapy as a way of making a healthy transition from PMS to menopause.<p>
	Estrogen rarely declines until the onset of menopause and hot flashes  and declines much less than progesterone. Taking Premarin, Estraderm or Estrase (the 3 estrogens most commonly prescribed) further upsets your estrogen/progesterone imbalance and only invites more problems. <p>
	The idea that if a woman takes estrogen she’ll look young forever is a dangerous illusion. Estrogen causes her to retain fluids which plump up her skin and produce weight gain. Excess water can be retained in the brain, causing irritability; or it can be retained in the breasts, making them swollen, lumpy, tender, and crampy; or it can stimulate excessive, potentially dangerous glandular growth in the colon, breast, and uterus. <p>
	<b>RESTORING PROGESTERONE NATURALLY</b>. We’re seeing declining levels of progesterone starting at age 30 all through the Western world. Main-stream medicine doesn’t understand the importance of progesterone. It focuses on progestin in the form of products such as Provera, Agest, and DepoProvera. These progesterone-like synthetic chemicals don’t have all the good effects and benefits, such as stimulating bone growth and preempting osteoporosis, that you get from natural progesterone. Instead, they have many negative side effects including water retention, depression, and the increased risk of blood clots.<p>
	Unless a woman has already stopped having periods and is having hot flashes, I will try her on natural progesterone first. Often the period restarts and gets more regular and the hot flashes begin to diminish over the course of 1 to 3 months for as long as several years.  <p>
	Progesterone cream delivered through the skin (transdermally) is the best form of delivery. When you take female hormones orally, 90% are destroyed by the liver and only 10% get into your blood. The burden on the liver and gallbladder is known to increase the risk of gallstones, gallbladder disease, and liver cancer.<p>
	The doses and periods of application vary according to what it’s being used for (PMS, fibroids, or menopause) and the strength of the product. Generally, women should apply a half a teaspoon twice a day from ovulation to the day before bleeding. I recommend that you rub it on your abdomen below the navel, over your uterus, on your breasts, and perhaps a tiny amount on your arms and face. <p>
	For about 80% of the women I’ve treated with progesterone cream, the hormones are efficiently absorbed and reduce symptoms. If the woman continues to be uncomfortable, I add natural, transdermal estrogens to the progesterone cream treatment.  <p>
	<b>ENHANCE THE ESTRIOL</b>. Of the three estrogens a woman’s body makes (E1, estrone; E2, estradiol; and E3, estriol), estradiol and estrone are consistently associated with cancer risks. These are the estrogens found in the pharmaceutical hormones given to women. Estriol is safer and healthier and can help shrink fibroids and lower cancer risks. 	<p>
	That is why I prescribe 8-10 times more estriol than the other two estrogens which, if I must use them, I prescribe in low doses to reduce the risk. And again, I make sure that progesterone is included to constantly buffer estrogen’s over-stimulating effect on the glands.  <p>
	<b>AVOID PREMARIN—IT’S FOR HORSES</b>. It’s  ridiculous to give women horse hormones. But that’s what Premarin is, literally and phonetically: it is pregnant mare's urine, out of which estrogenic hormonal chemicals are distilled for use by women. Of the approximately 12 estrogens in horse urine, only 2 exactly match a woman’s. In the 40 years we've been prescribing Premarin, there has not been adequate testing to discover what these 10 other horse estrogens do to a woman. There is evidence to suggest, however, that they produce an increased risk for female cancers. If that isn’t enough, not all women who take Premarin actually get rid of their hot flashes, which is supposedly the most common symptom for which Premarin is prescribed. <p>
	I would avoid Provera  and if possible, stay clear of  Premarin, Estrase, and Estratest. The testosterone that’s given to women in pharmaceutical preparations like Estratest is methyl-testosterone which has been known to cause liver and cardiac damage. Products such as Provera, medroxy-progesterone, and Agestin, are chemically altered (for patenting purposes) with the result that they do not match human progesterone. They will upset your natural balance of hormones and produce damaging side effects, plus fail miserably to do the real progesterone’s most important job, which is to stimulate bone density.<p>
	<b>USE HERBS WITH PROGESTERONE</b>. I’m concerned that in a woman's desire to treat herself (since so many women are not getting the help they need from mainstream physicians) she will take only estrogenic herbs. Examples of these are dong quai, alfalfa, licorice root, ginseng, anise seed, garlic, fennel, papaya, red clover, and sage. <p>
	Although these may make your symptoms go away, they could also increase the risk of fibroids, tumors, and cancers. Make sure that your formulas contain progesterone-precursor herbs, such as wild yam, sarsaparilla, and chaste berry (Vitex agnus cassus). <p>
	<b>AVOID THE PILL</b>.  In general, I’m conservative about birth control pills because they are synthetic hormones and suppress the natural activity of the ovaries. They are preferable only to repeated abortions. I am willing to give younger women birth control pills for a limited time, reminding them that this is not the best method. I am not saying that 5 years of taking birth control pills is dreadfully dangerous, but any excessive use of the Pill, when there are intelligent alternatives, is an unnecessary risk. <p>
	I have a woman in my practice who took the birth control pill for 17 years. When she quit, she went into menopause 10 years early because her ovaries could not “wake up” and “remember” their proper function. <p>
	For women on birth control pills, it is essential to take supplements high in the vitamin B complex and antioxidants (A, C, E). Over time, the Pill can dramatically deplete your reserve of B and C vitamins which, in turn, can lead to conditions such as cervical dysplasia (a change in the shape or size of cells in the cervix) that may result in cervical cancer.<p>
	Traditionally, birth control pills are only prescribed for women up to age 35, but some physicians are prescribing them for relief from menopausal symptoms. There is no research demonstrating the safety of these pills when given to women over 35. Not only are they made of synthetic hormones, they contain higher levels of estrogen than are needed during menopause and are implicated in a higher risk of ovarian and breast cancer. Further, they suppress the activity of the brain’s pituitary gland.<p>
	<b>RUN FROM NORPLANT</b>. I’ve observed that the Norplant contraceptive tends to upset women. It contains a synthetic progesterone that interferes with the monthly hormonal cycle and makes  women more miserable. 			This product, like all synthetic progesterones, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and blood clots, can produce water retention, weight gain, irregular bleeding,  and depression, and  interfere with thyroid function. Some patients tell me that using this form of contraception makes them feel as if a black cloud has settled over them. <p>
	<b>HAVE A HORMONE FAST</b>. I recommend that a woman “cycle” her hormones in a way that resembles how her body has always done this. Constant hormonal stimulation may be convenient; unfortunately, it is also probably dangerous. Previous to this generation, women have always “cycled,” meaning they’ve had 4-7 days off every month (during menstruation when estrogen and progesterone levels are at their lowest) so their body gets a break. Discontinue all hormone treatments during this “fast.” Let your tissues and organs have 4-7 days off monthly to detoxify from the hormonal effects. <p>
	<b>CHANGE YOUR DIET</b>. Choose foods that are low in fat, high in fiber, unprocessed, and unrefined. Sugar, fats, alcohol, and white flour are notorious for increasing the symptoms of hormonal imbalances, from the mood swings and irritability of PMS to uterine fibroids and fibrocystic breasts. The greater your discomfort, the cleaner your diet must be.<p>
	Milk products, however, should be completely eliminated, regardless of your symptom status. According to research from Frank Oski, M.D., of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, milk products can help cause osteoporosis, heart disease, and allergies. Milk is  probably one of the most concentrated sources of harmful pesticides and environmental estrogen-like chemicals. These mimic and exaggerate the activity of natural estrogen in your body.   <p>
	<b>TAKE MULTIVITAMINS</b>. Taking a vitamin supplement is as important as changing your diet. That’s because we get fewer nutrients in our depleted standard American diet;  the soil our food is grown in is gravely deficient in nutrients, so even healthy foods have fewer nutrients than they used to; and our absorption and digestion become less efficient as we age.		I recommend multiple vitamin formulas that are taken with meals.  A good supplement for women should contain, specifically,  600 mg of calcium and 500-600 mg of magnesium. <p>
	<b>DETOXIFY YOUR LIVER</b>. Many of the problems women experience can be alleviated by cleansing the liver. The liver is the largest filter in the body,  responsible for processing all hormones and toxins; it must also deal with thousands of toxic substances that routinely enter the human body.	<p>
	First, take the pressure off your liver by lowering the amounts of oils (excepting olive oil) and fats in your diet, especially fried fats because these do more damage to the liver than any other single food. <p>
	Second, start a liver-cleansing program using a preformulated blend, such as Eclectic Institute’s Opti-Lipotropic and Prevail’s Metabolic Liver Formula. The purpose of Opti-Lipotropic (containing, in part, B6, choline, inositol, dandelion, celandine, beet leaf, Oregon grape, and milk thistle) is to remove fats and other poisons from the liver.  Metabolic Liver Formula also contains herbs and natural plant enzymes that help detoxify and strengthen the liver. These ingredients work best when used together, so do not take them singly. <p>
	I recommend doing a 2-month (even better, 3-month) course of this at least once a year. For women with severe PMS, the course can be for longer periods of time and more often. All women should start doing this by age 35-40, and it wouldn’t hurt to begin this preventively in your 20s. Detox-ification with these herbal formulas assists your liver in undoing its part in the body's imbalance. I recommend that you do this in consultation with a health practitioner who will tailor it to your unique needs.  <p>
	<b>MENOPAUSE ENJOY THE CHANGE OF A LIFETIME</b>. If you follow the steps I’ve outlined, by the time menopause arrives, the transition will not be traumatic. I encourage women to look at what this transition means to them. Do you think it's the end of the world, that you’re used and dried up? If you do, this view has dangerous negative repercussions on your physical experience of menopause. <p>
	In nearly every other culture around the planet, at menopause a woman  becomes more valued than at any other time in her life. It may be a shocking view to many women in our culture, but menopause is actually the moment you’ve spent your life preparing for, when you step into your wisdom and power. <p>
	It’s time to change your outlook from just trying to make it through menopause to resolving to make  the most of this healthy and natural life transition.<p>
