<H3>5. Vehicle Emissions Reduction Technologies Have Successfully Cut 
Emissions</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
New cars in the early 1990s emitted only about one-fourth as much 
pollution as uncontrolled vehicles of the 1960s.<a href="#269" name="r269"> [ 269 ] </a>This progress
has been
due primarily to federal uniform standards for new-car emissions.<a href="#270" name="r270"> [ 270 ] </a>These 
standards have spurred the development of numerous technologies, including 
cleaner fuels, advances in pollution-control technologies such as 
catalytic converters and electronic fuel-injection systems, better vehicle 
maintenance technologies, and inspection standards. Lead, for example, has 
been virtually eliminated from motor vehicle exhaust through the 
introduction of cleaner fuels.<BR>

<p>     Despite vast reductions in tailpipe emissions, automobiles are still 
a primary source of urban air pollution. This is because people are 
driving more - racking up 43 percent more vehicles miles traveled (VMT) 
each year.<a href="#271" name="r271"> [ 271 ] </a>Increases in the number of vehicle miles traveled has more 
than offset increases in average vehicle fuel economy. Every American 
travels, on average, nearly 8,800 miles each year in a car or light truck, 
and the rate of increase in per capita VMT is growing at more than 2 
percent per year.<a href="#272" name="r272"> [ 272 ] </a>In the absence of additional efficiency standards, 
total end-use carbon emissions in the transport sector are projected to 
increase by 90.7 million metric tons between 1990 and 2010, because growth 
in personal and freight travel is projected to outpace fuel-efficiency 
improvements.<a href="#273" name="r273"> [ 273 ] </a><P>
