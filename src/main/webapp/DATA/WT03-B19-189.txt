<h1>Relocating staff</h1>
<p>
An important investment consideration for many international 
companies is the cost and associated issues of locating expatriate 
staff in 
overseas cities.

<p>
The Advantage Melbourne study looked at expatriate costs, 
comparing 
the expenses of housing, purchasing a car, and schooling for a 10-
year-old. 
On all measures, Melbourne rates as a very cost competitive city.

Housing costs are generally much lower in Melbourne than in other 
cities in the region: Melbourne's are less than one half those of Hong 
Kong, less than one third those of Singapore, 
29% lower than Jakarta, and 44% lower than Kuala Lumpur.

The cost of purchasing and running a motor vehicle varies 
considerably between international locations. The analysis shows 
that the cost of buying a car in Melbourne is significantly lower 
than in most other regional locations; for example, less than one 
quarter of the cost in Singapore, 58% lower than in Bangkok, and 
47% lower than in Jakarta.

relocated to a new city. Overall, the cost of private school education
