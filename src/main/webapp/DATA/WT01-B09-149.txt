<B>Project Title:  EV Safety Issues and the Safety & Liability Roadmap<p>

Performing Organization:  Hudson Institute, Northwest Diversified Services</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Dr. Jim Wheeler, Hudson, (317) 545­1537<br>

<B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>Electric Vehicle development has been accelerated in the past few years due to mandates in
several states. The use of electric vehicles is expected to be the greatest since the turn of the century. Since many
more electric vehicles will be present on the highways, the changes of accidents will increase with these additional
miles driven. These vehicles will have a greater probability of interacting with the existing vehicle fleet and
infrastructure. This concern has caused many different groups to look at possible voids in current standards and
regulations. Currently, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), Electricore Power Research Institute's (EPRI)
Health and Safety committee, Department of Energy's (DOE) Battery Readiness Committee European standards
committees, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have begun to review, test, and
develop draft standards. Besides the groups reviewing design and infrastructure issues of electric vehicles,
insurance companies will need to know what the cost of repair and safety durability will be for these new vehicles.
Therefore, each vehicle developed in the DARPA program will need to be kept aware of all these issues to maximize
the market potential for the vehicle being developed.</P>

<P>Electric vehicle safety issues have become one of the major issues which could inhibit the emergence of a viable
electric vehicle industry. New standards and recommended practices are currently being developed by the major
manufacturers and suppliers. The vehicles developed for the DARPA consortia have not had the ongoing capacities
of attending or being a part of each of these committees. It is important that each vehicle development team in the
DARPA consortia understand and are current on each of the new draft safety requirements from these committees.
If these items are not designed into their vehicles in the early stages of development, thousands, or millions, of
dollars may be required to redesign the vehicles later. This could cost these new vehicle manufacturers market
share or eliminate them all together from consideration. </P>

<P>It has been recognized by Electricore that each DARPA consortia should have guidance concerning vehicle safety
issues during the development of electric vehicles. As a result, Electricore has taken on the effort of crash testing
one of their own electric conversions and sharing the information, creating a safety course for electric vehicle and
hybrid users, and is currently compiling a study concerning the safety, environmental, and liability challenges facing
the introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles into the marketplace. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE),
Department of Energy's (DOE) Battery Readiness Committee, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA), and the Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI) Health and Safety Committee, are currently working on
electric vehicle safety standards and recommendations. This project is intended to coordinate all the current safety
efforts within the DARPA consortia. The project will consist of three parts with principal investigator, Michael S.
Beebe from NDS, Inc., responsible for attending SAFE, DOE Battery Readiness Committee meetings, etc., and
reporting a summary to the DARPA consortia; coordination of all safety testing for each DARPA consortia; to assist
DARPA consortia members on electric vehicle development issues as they pertain to safety. Visits to each
consortia will be done as required.</P>
