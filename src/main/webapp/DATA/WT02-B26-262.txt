<h1>
<A NAME="Heading1">Great Canadian Scientists Backgrounder</A></h1>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading2">Introduction</A></h2>


<b></b>The Great Canadian Scientists project was started to
increase Canadian's awareness of the great scientists that our country
produces. Over the last five years with the help of several grants the project
has developed a website, book and CD-ROM to meet this goal.<p>

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading3">The idea</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Barry Shell is a science writer at SFU responsible for publishing
a newsletter that profiles the work of SFU scientists. One day in the hallway
an Engineering professor named Jamal Deen suggested that Shell might apply the
same techniques he was using in the newsletter to a book on the <i>greatest</i>
Canadian scientists. Figuring therealready  must be many books like this, Shell
went to the public library expecting to bring home an armload. Imagine his
surprise when the science librarian at the main branch of the Vancouver public
library told him that no such book existed. The librarian said there was a
strong need for such a book, especially for school-aged kids who were
constantly coming into the library with assignments to write about Canadian
scientists. Thus the project began.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading4">Three Definitions</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Everyone asks, "What do you mean by Great? How do you define
Canadian? And what about the word Scientist?" It's difficult to compare the sum
of great people's lives. Any listing like the one in the GCS project is bound
to generate debate. When Isaac Asimov wrote his Biographical Encyclopedia of
Science and Technology in the 60s he did not even let an assistant type it. In
this way he felt the responsibility for the scientists chosen for that
compendium rested with him alone. In a similar way, Shell takes full
responsibility for the choices in the list of scientists for the GCS project.
There is no committee, just him.<p>
How can you define greatness? Shell starts with Nobel laureates, but also looks
for Canadian winners of the King Faisal prize, the Albert Einstein Award of the
World Cultural Council, the Wolfe prize from Israel, the Welch foundation in
Texas and of course Canada's own Killam, Gairdner, Manning, Herzberg and
Steacie prize winners. As much as possible, he tries to check with peers as to
whether a particular scientist's work was considered to be the best in their
field. He also attempts to select scientists from all parts of Canada, and a
wide variety of disciplines.<p>
There have been many inconsistencies and Shell welcomes ideas for improving the
project. From time to time he receives mail from people who suggest, for
example, that Roberta Bondar (first Canadian woman in space) or David Suzuki
(popular environmentalist) should not really be included. Shell's response:
"Maybe so if you just look at their scientific achievements, but I figure if
you can make it into orbit, or get your science messages on national TV every
week, that's definitely great."<p>
He defines Canadian scientists as researchers who held Canadian citizenship
when they made their most outstanding scientific discoveries. That's it. That
means many of the people in the project were not born in Canada, and some were
born here but do not live in Canada any more.<p>
Scientist is hard to define. At first the project began with researchers in
Physics, Chemistry and Biology and most of the people in the project do work in
these three core disciplines. But the boundaries have blurred a bit and a few
doctors, engineers, computer scientists, and psychologists have joined the
list. There is no good reason for this. It just seems like a good idea and it
makes the project more interesting.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading5">Women Scientists</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>No product evolves in isolation. A purely "objective" commitment
to scientific achievement ignores other equally important factors that go
beyond science and that indirectly affect the process of science and who does
that science. Historically and currently, women face barriers to entering a
scientific career. It became a project goal to encourage girls and young women
to enter science by including many women scientists whose achievements are
worthy of acknowledgement and can serve as inspiration to women interested in
becoming scientists. Hence the percentage of women in the project is about 20%
while in reality the percentage of practicing woman scientists in Canada is
somewhere around 5%.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading6">Born, Bred, Matured and First Published on the
Internet</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>The content of Great Canadian Scientists began in June 1991 with
a posting in several Internet discussion groups (Usenet) that called for
nominations. A list of about 70 scientists was quickly generated. As the months
and years went by, the list was refined and rebroadcast to the newsgroups and
more nominations were solicited. Several responders helped verify some
nominees' citizenship or career achievements. Email was used to contact many
scientists, too. Once, upon receiving an email query from me about a nominee
and colleague, a researcher at AT&amp;T Bell labs simply walked down the hall
to ask Brian Kernighan (one of the creators of the C programming language) if
he was a Canadian citizen. The answer came back in just a few minutes. He is.
<p>
With poor prospects for conventional book publication, early drafts of the
information were first published on the World Wide Web beginning in May 1995.
Many thousands of "visitors" later that original manuscript has been much
improved and the book, a website and a CD-ROM are the results.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading7">Publication of three formats</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Great Canadian Scientists is the first product available to
Canadians that integrates and utilizes new and traditional media for learning
about Canadian men and women of science. The product synergistically combines
the book with a website and a companion CD-ROM. Each medium delivers the
material in a different way and each has strengths that the others do not. They
work together, not against each other. With the CD-ROM students can hear and
see the scientists talk about themselves and their work in their own words.
Scientific principles can be hammered home through fun-to-play interactive
computer games. With the website, they can send email directly to living
scientists and ask questions. They can play the quiz and try to beat other kids
all across the country (and the rest of the world) playing at the same time.
The book lets them go home and read more about the scientists on the living
room couch or do activities at the kitchen table.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading8">100% Canadian Focus and Content!</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>GCS has a pure and single-minded Canadian slant. Other available
products, though perhaps made in Canada, often try to target the more lucrative
American market so they must be watered down or altered to fit American school
curricula.<p>
Great Canadian Scientists fits the mandate of the Information Highway Advisory
council to protect Canadians from the potential for a loss of Canadian identity
due to the American slant of the Internet. It also fits with a new Pan-Canadian
Instructional Resource Profile that emphasizes curriculum content about the
process of science. Canadians need to tell the world that we are particularly
great at science. Canada has a great reputation in the world of science. Great
Canadian Scientists shows you why.
<h2>
<A NAME="Heading9">The People</A></h2>

<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i>Barry Shell   Director and Project Manager<br></b>Besides two books on
