<B><I> My child has just been identified as "gifted and talented." How do we decide 
whether to enroll her in the gifted program?  How do we decide about 
acceleration?  I am concerned that my child will be separated from friends and
classmates and may be teased by other children. I am also concerned that my child 
will feel pressured by the work, to a point that she dislikes school. Also my 
child does not want to leave her current school, and does not want to be 
classified any differently than her friends.

Please help me with the pros and cons of these issues, and any other guidance you
can offer.

<HR> <P>

The decision to enroll a child in a gifted program is not irreversible. If the placement
doesn't work out, the child can always go back to the regular education classroom. The
reverse is rarely true. If you opt to keep your child in the regular education classroom,
and your child quickly becomes bored, transferring to the gifted classroom during the
same school year may not be possible. <P>
Research indicates the following:<P>

Gifted students benefit from learning together and should be placed with 
similar students in their areas of strength.<P>

It has been extremely difficult for regular education teachers to differentiate curriculum
to meet the needs of gifted students in mixed ability classrooms.<P>

Many gifted students think and learn differently from their chronological age mates who
are not gifted. They tend to better understand, accept, and use their learning
differences as assets when they are grouped together. When they are provided with
consistent appropriate academic challenge, they tend to be more comfortable with
themselves (and others).<P>

When cooperative learning has been used in the regular education classroom, gifted
students often become tutors and learn less academic content. The other students may
depend on them to do most of the work, or do the work that is difficult, and therefore the
regular education students also learn less academic content.<P>

Gifted students frequently know many of the concepts introduced in the regular 
education class and waste a lot of time. They often develop bad habits, such as 
constant daydreaming.<P>

Gifted students are more likely to socialize "normally" when they are with 
students who share their interests and learning style. This is most likely to occur with 
intellectual age mates, regardless of chronological age.<P>

  This review of the literature focuses on research findings concerning the 
long-term academic, social, and emotional effects of acceleration, as well as 
the results of non-acceleration, on gifted children.  Access to accelerated 
programs in Canada and the United States was also investigated.  The review led 
to the following conclusions: (1) academic outcomes of acceleration are 
positive; (2) no carefully executed research has been conducted that has found 
negative social and/or emotional outcomes of acceleration of gifted children; 
(3) gifted children who are not intellectually stimulated and challenged may 
become underachievers and not fulfill their potential; and (4) acceleration is 
not widely used in Canada or the United States.  Especially noted is the 
widespread opposition to acceleration by educators despite research which 
clearly finds that their concerns are unfounded.  (Contains 30 references.)

  This report describes an extension of the Learning Outcomes Study (a 
nationwide longitudinal investigation of 1,010 students just entering programs 
for gifted learners in grades 2 and 3) to investigate excellence within each of 
the four program types considered: within-class programs, pull-out programs, 
separate classes, and special schools.  The qualitative extension focused on an 
"exemplary" model from each of the program types.  Two program evaluation 
tools, the Program Profile Form and Program Satisfaction Survey (with versions 
for students, parents, teachers, and administrators), were created to document 
key program components.  Program profiles included a description of each 
program's setting and general procedures (identification process, curricular 
options, staff selection, school demographics) and five criteria: leadership, 
atmosphere and environment, communication, curriculum and instruction, and 
attention to student needs.  In addition, ways that all selected programs 
addressed the needs of diverse populations of students were addressed.  
Appendices provide additional information on program demographic information, 
program profiles, the interview questions used, the program satisfaction 
surveys, and other research aspects of the study.  Executive Summary is also 
published separately.  (Contains approximately 95 references.) (DB)<BR>

  This book looks at gifted and talented students from a "national resource" 
point of view.  The first chapter establishes the basic premise that gifted and 
talented children represent a significant resource to any nation and that it is 
profitable to the nation to invest in their development and education.  
Subsequent chapters describe types of giftedness, characteristics of gifted 
youth, underidentified gifted populations (and techniques for identifying 
them), and the role of adults in fostering giftedness and providing needed 
opportunities.  One chapter is devoted to the special case of gifted females.  
One chapter addresses nine categories of options available for enhancing the 
educational experiences of gifted students and explains how these options can 
be modified and combined to meet the needs of a specific school district and 
its gifted students.  A chapter on "follow-up" studies of gifted and talented 
students suggests certain commonalities in personal qualities among the 
"successful" gifted and talented as well as the kinds of activities that appear 
to promote achievement and maintain a positive self-concept.  (Contains 
approximately 230 references.) (DB)<BR>

  It is argued that lack of sustained academic effort, not student grouping, is 
the major reason for differences in student performance.  Ability grouping is 
seen as a useful tool, especially in accelerated programs for bright children, 
that should not be rejected in favor of approaches that ignore individual 
differences.  (MSE)<BR>

  This research examines how a developmentally appropriate educational program 
in the early years can affect the development of gifted children.  The 
qualitative research specifically focused on a multi-age, multi-ability setting 
with partial implementation of a whole language program, a systematic writing 
process and with some flexibility in grouping of students.  Eleven teachers and 
approximately 260 students in an ungraded primary school were involved, with 3 
first year and 30 second year students identified as gifted.  The study found 
that gifted children followed a somewhat accelerated curriculum.  Teachers felt 
that there were definite social benefits to integrating the gifted and 
nongifted students.  The multi-age, multi-ability setting seemed to allow young 
students not identified as gifted to progress more rapidly than they might have 
in a traditional graded classroom, as they were exposed to higher level 
instruction.  There was little evidence of the development of creative 
productivity or multiple intelligences other than linguistic and logical-
mathematical.  Interviews with teachers indicated their willingness to allow 
students to do above-grade level work and to use higher level materials with 
some children.  Interview questions are provided in an appendix.  (Contains 12

  A study gathered quantitative and qualitative data on the cognitive and 
affective outcomes for gifted students (grades 3-6) in full- and part-time 
programs from three classrooms in each of two neighboring school districts, one 
urban and one rural.  Results suggested that outcomes are affected by the goal 
structures of classrooms and that the instructional environment of a gifted 
classroom may be a more important variable than the amount of time students 
spend in a program.  Differences in the full- and part-time classrooms 
operating in the two districts and their effects were examined.  Qualitative 
analysis led to the proposition that cooperatively structured classrooms were 
more successful learning environments than competitive ones.  Numerous examples 
and quotes drawn from the researcher's classroom observations are given.  I
llustrations provide floor plans, daily routines, and schedules of classroom 
activities for both the self-contained and pull-out classrooms in the two 
districts.  (VW)<BR>
