<B>Project Title: SmartCoolTM Air Condition System ­ Electric Bus<p>

Performing Organization: Smart Power Systems</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Gregg Peterson, (810) 682­0203</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The project objective is to develop a high­efficiency, lightweight air conditioning system for
electric buses. The system is based on a new two­stage centrifugal compressor with an integral DC brushless
permanent magnet motor designed by Smart Power Systems. The system uses a low pressure environmentally
friendly refrigerant; system pressures are typically 15 psi to 30 pSI. The nominal design output is 18,000 BTU/hr;
the maximum design capacity is 21,000 BTU/hr. The theoretical compressor input power at 18,000 BTU/hr is less
than 1,400 watts at the ASHRAE high­efficiency rating point. Input power is substantially reduced as a function of
ambient conditions. As an example, modeling the system at the ASHRAE SEER rating point yields an output of
over 8,000 BTU/hr using less than 400 watts of compressor input power.</P> 

<P>The SmartCool centrifugal compressor weighs under 10 pounds and is 30% smaller than similar capacity electric
R134a compressors. </P>

<P>A microprocessor continuously monitors and controls all system parameters with millisecond response times and
ensures that the compressor is operating at its highest efficiency at all times. Computer­controller functions
include compressor motor speed, condenser fan speed, evaporator fan speed, and expansion valve setting</P>.

<P>In addition to the centrifugal compressor and the control electronics, the module incorporates high­efficiency air
moving devices, plate fin heat exchangers, an electronic expansion valve and condensate reclamation to further
enhance performance. Composite materials are used throughout the module to minimize weight</P>.

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P>

<P>Three roof­mounted 324 VDC SmartCool modules will be installed on an AVS electric bus
and evaluated this summer. The objective is to improve the a/c operational efficiency and reduce the a/c system
weight by 400 pounds.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P> QTR2 1966 installation target ­ performance evaluations and engineering enhancements to
continue through the end of the contract (2/97).
