<P>
<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
Spending on food and beverages in Australia is around $50 billion. The national
food manufacturing sector accounts for just under 4% of the national GDP. Australia exports over $8 billion of food products.
<P>
Food and beverage production has expanded almost 30% between 1991 and 1994. Growth in domestic food consumption of around 12% was exceeded by growth in export sales. Productivity in the food and beverage sector has risen strongly as spare productive capacity has been used up and efficiency improvements have been put in place.
<P>
Exports of food products have increased on average by 10% per annum over the past three years, including even higher growth in dairy products and fruit and vegetables. Spending on R&D by the food and beverages industry in 1992-93 was $137 million.
<P>
National investment by the food and beverages sector is rebounding strongly from a downturn during the early 1990s recession. Spending increased 40% in 1993-94 and further growth is expected in 1994-95 to meet increased sales in both the domestic and export markets.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
Food and beverage production accounts for 21% of manufacturing output and almost 5% of Victoria's total economic output. Victoria contributes 33% of Australias food and beverage manufacturing value-added, compared with around 25% of national food consumption.
<P>
Victoria dominates the manufacture of dairy products, fruit and vegetables, cakes and biscuits, confectionery and pet food.
<P>
While more than 1000 food processing companies operate in Victoria, the largest
20 companies generate 50% of total food industry turnover and 70% of employment.  The 12 largest exporters account for 75% of Victoria's food exports.
<P>
The ten largest food companies in the world have processing plants in Australia,
the majority being located in Victoria, including H.J. Heinz, Kraft Foods, 
Cadbury Schweppes, EFFEM (Mars and Uncle Bens), Bunge, Snow Brand, Campbells 
Soups and Nestl&egrave;.
<P>
Food and beverage exports in 1993-94 were $2.5 billion or 30% of national food 
exports. Victoria's food exports go mainly to Asia, particularly Japan. The 
trade surplus is approximately $1.86 billion.
<P>
More than $700 million has been invested or committed recently in the industry, 
mainly for export sales. Key investors include Kraft ($100 million), 
Nestl&egrave; Confectionery ($60 million), Cadbury Schweppes, Bonlac, Murray 
Goulburn and Snow Brand.
<P>
Spending on R&D by the food and beverages industry in Victoria in 1992-93 was $49 million or 36% of the national total.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</I></B>
<P>
There is great potential to add further value to the State's agricultural production, particularly for export-oriented processed food manufacturing.
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics projects sales growth for processed foods, excluding meat and flour, to average 3.5% through to 2005. Exports are projected to increase at 8.5%.
<P>
The positive outlook for the industry is due to Australia's comparative advantage in food production, rapid growth in Asian markets and more aggressive and competitive Australian producers.
