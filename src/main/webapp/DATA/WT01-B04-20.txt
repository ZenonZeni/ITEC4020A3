                  <P><FONT SIZE=4>VANCOUVER, BC and EMERYVILLE, CA
                  (August 27, 1996) -- Inflazyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
                  (Vancouver Stock Exchange: IZP) and SuperGen, Inc.
                  (Nasdaq: SUPG &amp; SUPGW) jointly announced today
                  that the two companies have signed a letter of
                  intent that grants SuperGen exclusive worldwide
                  rights to anti-cancer and all other applications,
                  except inflammation, of certain Inflazyme
                  technologies and drugs.</FONT>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE=4>Inflazyme stated that preclinical
                  studies of its drugs have shown effectiveness
                  against lung, colon and skin cancers, as well as
                  lymphomas and leukemias.  Additionally, certain of
                  the drugs target multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancers
                  that no longer respond to available therapies. 
                  Based on results to date, the companies said U.S.
                  human clinical trials could begin as early as
                  1997.</FONT>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE=4>While the terms of the agreement
                  have been defined, they were not specifically
                  disclosed.  The companies said the license granted
                  to SuperGen is based on a combination of equity
                  investment in Inflazyme's common stock, milestone
                  payments and royalties to Inflazyme on net product
                  sales.  The final licensing agreement between the
                  companies remains subject to mutual review, which
                  is expected be completed within 60 days.</FONT>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE=4>"We are convinced that SuperGen is
                  an excellent partner for Inflazyme's oncology
                  opportunities since that is one of SuperGen's
                  primary areas of focus," said Hassan Salari, Ph.D.,
                  President and CEO of Inflazyme.  "Our primary focus
                  remains inflammation, and we retain those rights. 
                  We are confident that due diligence for the final
                  agreement can proceed quickly."</FONT>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE=4>"Inflazyme's compounds can be a
                  strong addition to our growing pipeline of
                  anti-cancer drugs, expanding our existing tier of
                  proprietary, value-added products," said Joseph
                  Rubinfeld, Ph.D., President and CEO of SuperGen. 
                  "The value Inflazyme has already built into these
                  drugs is consistent with our strategy of entering
                  the game at the 50-yard line and allows us to
                  leverage our core strengths in clinical
                  development."</FONT>

                  of products intended to treat life-threatening
                  diseases, particularly cancer and blood cell
                  disorders, as well as other serious conditions such
                  as obesity.  SuperGen is developing its anticancer
                  portfolio of nine generic products and five
                  enhanced or "supergeneric" products.  Blood cell

                  <P><FONT SIZE=4>Inflazyme Pharmaceuticals is a
                  biopharmaceutical company specializing in the
                  design, discovery and commercialization of novel
                  generations of drugs which combat such major
                  diseases as asthma, allergies, arthritis and
                  numerous other illnesses categorized as
                  inflammatory diseases.  The company's proprietary
                  small-molecule pharmaceuticals are the products of
                  its own Transcription Factor-based drug development
                  programs involving the utilization,
                  synergistically, of a variety of combinatorial
                  chemistry, molecular modeling, and structural
                  synthesizing and screening techniques.  Inflazyme's
                  existing world-patented 50-compound family of
                  drugs, capable of functioning as both therapeutics
                  and preventatives, have exhibited efficacies,
                  potencies and durations-of-action which are
                  significantly greater than steroids, yet cause none
                  of the pervasive side effects which steroids
                  typically produce.  Because of their universal
                  applicability and ready adaptability to delivery
                  via inhaler or in pill, powder or syrup form, the
                  company's proprietary compounds are projected to
                  replace steroids as first-line therapies for the
                  management of a wide variety of inflammatory
                  diseases.  Inflazyme's current lead drugs are
                  Apanol for asthma, Tiesole for allergies, and
                  Bispan for arthritis.  In its search for
                  anti-inflammatory drugs, the company has also
                  discovered a novel generation of small molecules
                  that may provide treatment for various cancer
                  types, which are the subject of the license
                  agreement with SuperGen.</FONT>
