<H2>Letter to Crime Subcommittee regarding H.R. 3508</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
September 11, 1996<BR>
<BR>
Members of the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee <BR>
and Interested Parties:<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Democracy and Technology urges the Crime Subcommittee to
cast a critical eye on the &quot;Children's Privacy Protection and Parental
Empowerment Act&quot; (CPPPEA) (HR 3508).  While we commend the bill's sponsor,
Representative Franks, and Chairman McCollum, as well as the members of
the Committee for their efforts to protect children's privacy, we believe
that the solutions proposed in the CPPPEA -- particularly as they relate
to the exchange of information on the Internet -- will increase the collection
of information about children in certain circumstances and criminalize behavior
in a vast array of unintended situations, thereby compromising the free
flow of information online.  <BR>
<BR>
CDT is committed to advancing individual privacy on the Internet.  We believe
that protecting children's privacy is a subject in need of exploration and
action, however we urge the Committee to seek solutions that both protect
privacy and respect our First Amendment freedoms.  <BR>
<BR>
As stated by CDT, Voters Telecommunications Watch, People for the American
Way, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in a June 1996 letter to Representative
Franks (attached), the CPPPEA raises a number of significant privacy and
First Amendment concerns.  
<UL>
<LI>Compliance with the bill could well lead to an increase in the collection
of information about children and adults, compounding privacy risks.  Information
providers on the Internet currently have no way of distinguishing children
from adults.  Given marketers and other information providers desire to
continue their business, it is likely that they will seek to collect more
intrusive information about children's ages and their parents in an effort
to limit their liability and garner parental consent.  In the worst case
scenario this could lead to an unacceptably intrusive national ID system
for the Internet (a system that none of us support).  
<LI>The term &quot;list broker,&quot; is drafted to cover any entity which
exchanges personal information in the course of its operation.  The vast
majority of World Wide Web site operators, as well as anyone who operates
a listserv, mailing list or other information distribution mechanism, all
collect, store, and may well exchange, email addresses.  Unless Web site
operators obtain parental consent before collecting information, they risk
criminal penalties for violation of section (a)(4). <BR>
 <BR>
<LI>The requirement to disclose the source and content of personal information
about children to parents creates unclear new obligations on Internet information
providers.  In fact, many of the information providers who would be covered
by the CPPPEA do not keep track of the source of their information and thus
may not have the ability to comply with the statute.  Compliance with this
section could well lead to an increase in the overall collection of personal
information about Internet users, thereby compounding privacy risks.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Requiring parental consent in all instances and requiring providers
to disclose information to parents collected from children fails to acknowledge
the distinction between young children and teenagers and their rights under
the Constitution.  Such a provision as applied to a fourteen or fifteen
year old child may fail to respect the youth's independent First Amendment
and privacy interests.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Imposed identification procedures applied to the World Wide Web under
the threat of criminal penalties would limit all Internet users' ability
to read, speak, receive information and interact online under constitutionally-protected
conditions of anonymity. <BR>
 <BR>
<LI>Section (a)(6) which criminalizes any distribution or receipt of personal
information where the receiver has knowledge or &quot;reason to believe
that the information will be used to abuse the child or physically harm
the child&quot; is well-intentioned, but potentially so broad as to cover
anyone who receives and discloses personal information about a child, or
on the Internet anyone who allows a child to &quot;post&quot; information
about his or herself.  The bill establishes no clear standard of care or
level of knowledge necessary to meet this requirement, leaving everyone
on the Internet in doubt about whether or not they may be violating this
new crime.  Schools and organizations who publish directories as well as
newspapers who publish the identity of a child in a news story could be
subject to prosecution because they had &quot;reason to know&quot; that
the information may end up in the possession of bad actors.
</UL>
The Internet offers children unprecedented and important new educational
and recreational opportunities.  But, the medium also may offer access to
inappropriate material, and exposure to unfair marketing or information
collection practices.  Solutions to these problems must be carefully analyzed
and should take into account both the unique nature of the Internet, as
well as the multitude of First Amendment and privacy rights at stake for
all who seek to read, communicate, and associate with others in the online
environment.   <BR>
<BR>
Given the importance of addressing children's privacy issues, we suggest
that the Committee examine alternatives.  Empowering parents to protect
their children's privacy with existing technological tools, fair information
practices by the industry, and the enactment of more narrowly tailored legislation,
will help ensure that the Internet continues to grow and thrive for both
commercial and noncommercial endeavors.  For example, software already on
the market such as Cyberpatrol, as well as industry-standard technologies
such as the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) enable people
-- including parents and their children -- to restrict access to sites which
practice objectionable marketing and information collection techniques.<BR>
<BR>
At present, PICS technology, along with other innovative products, allows
parents to filter and block-out materials that contain objectionable content
or block access to sites with inappropriate or abusive marketing practices.
 Current technology can enable parents to: 
<UL>
<LI>prevent their children from accessing Web sites with inappropriate information
practices -- as defined by the parent or a consumer or privacy organization
of the parent's choice; 
<LI>prevent their children from revealing personal information such as name,
address, and e-mail address to others; 
<LI>install security measures such as passwords that prevent their child
from changing rules about Web site access or information disclosure, collection
and use that the parent has established. 
</UL>
CDT strongly believes that parents should be given the tools and legal remedies
necessary to ensure a safe, educational, and enjoyable online experience
for their children.  It is possible to craft a policy that will ensure children's
safety and protect children's privacy, consistent with the First Amendment.
 We urge the Committee to seek a policy that will protect the privacy of
users of the Internet, foster free speech, and continue the Internet's development
as a robust platform for social, political and economic activities.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,  <BR>
<BR>
