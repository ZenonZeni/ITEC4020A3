History</B></FONT></FONT>
<P>My wife, Karin, and I opened our office on September 17, 1983. I was still
working at Cigna Health Plan in Long Beach during the day. We would work
in our new Duarte office from 5PM till 10PM and on the weekend to get the
practice going. We called the office Convenient Care Medical Clinic. We decided
to open in Duarte because Karin has lived here almost all her life. After
we were married in 1982 we moved into our own townhouse in Duarte. At first
the practice was very slow. We once went 4 days without a single patient.
In January of 1984 I gave up my job at Cigna and devoted all my time to the
new clinic. We were open 7 days a week from 9AM till 9PM including holidays.
I remember celebrating Mother's Day with a big dinner at the clinic. When
we started we had a 5 month old son.
<P>
<P>Our concept was to make it easy and pleasant to go to a doctor. We wanted
our patients to be comfortable. We did not require an appointment and we
were open long hours so patients could come when it was convenient for them.
They could also come right away if there was an injury or acute illness.
&nbsp;Our fees were set at a reasonable level to be affordable for patients
without insurance. We offered a multitude of services under one room to avoid
sending patients to several places for tests and treatments. &nbsp;We always
try to be considerate of our patients because they are our customers. We
understand the trouble and expence our patients experience to see us and
we appreciate it. Fortunatly the practice became a success.
<P>
<P>Hendrietta joined our staff in 1985 as a receptionist. She has a remarkable
talent for doing 3 things at the same time and remembering thousands of patients
by name. She has usually been the telephone voice of our office and does
an outstanding job under difficult circumstances. She is very dedicated to
us and our patients. Hendrietta is now our office manager.
<P>
<P>Jesse joined our staff in 1987 as a back office nurse. She is a licensed
vocational nurse. Jessie can also do 3 things at the same time and is a very
dedicated employee. She has developed many skills since joining us. She draws
blood, takes x-rays, does EKGs, gives injections, takes vital signs, puts
on casts and bandages.
<P>
<P>In 1987 we changed our name to Kind Care Medical Center and developed
our current logo with a cross and a heart.
<P>
<P>In the last year we have developed an exciting new specialty in weight
control and preventive medicine. This program has succeeded far beyond our
expectations. Of course we still practice general medicine also. We have
had to seek additional help. Karin's mother Mrs. Derks has joined us to answer
the telephone and assist in making appointments. She has become very proficient
in explaining our program to new patients who call on the phone. She is starting
to learn to work on the computer also. This is especially remarkable because
she is paralysed from the neck down and has only limited use of her hands.
She is an RN and has worked for years at LA County USC Medical Center and
at Arcadia Methodist Hospital.
<P>
<P>Karin's sister Ingrid has also joined our staff part time. She is also
an RN and works full time at San Antonio Hospital. She helps us monitor the
medical status of our patients and is very effective at coaching our patients
to healther lifestyles.
<P>
<P>Our four children help us out at the office frequently by filing and doing
small jobs. They are Daniel (13), Erin (11), Justin (10), and Brenton
(9).
