<h1>How to Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization Debate </h1>

<h1>THE TEN CLAIMS </h1>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The three groups discussing legalization at Quantico touched
on a number of significant issues. It was evident to the
participants that the prolegalization arguments have remained
fairly consistent over the years and that there are ten major
claims that can be made in opposition of legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The participants have missed the point again. The arguments
have changed over the last few years in particular, which is what
brought them to Quantico in the first place. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>We have attempted to provide the ten simple, compelling claims
to help you frame your arguments against legalization. The claims
are backed up by facts, quotes and statistics. Periodically,
these will need to be updated to ensure that the most current
information is being used to craft arguments against
legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>In this booklet, the DEA puts its arguments on the line. When
these ten claims are gone, it will have no more argument for
continuing this drug war. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM I: CRIME, VIOLENCE AND DRUG USE GO HAND IN HAND </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>In this claim, the DEA does the first of its major distortions
- the lumping together of all drugs into the same group.
Different drugs have different effects and, for some drugs, there
is clearly very little association with violence. Marijuana and
tobacco are two examples of drugs with little reason to believe
that they are connected to violence. The DEA does not mention
hemp (marijuana) in this Claim so we must assume that they agree
that this argument would not apply to hemp (marijuana) in any
case. </p>

<p>Even if we accepted the DEA's arguments that drugs, and not
prohibition, causes violence, the best way to reduce the crime
and violence would be to reduce the drug use. There is no
evidence that throwing people in prison is the most effective way
to reduce drug use. All the evidence shows that treatment and
education are more cost-effective. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization contend that if drugs were
legalized, crime and violence would decrease. They believe that
it is the illegal nature of drug production, trafficking and use
that fuels crime and violence. They state that turf wars, gang
activity and drugrelated crimes are the result of the illegal
nature of the drug trade. Proponents state that users commit
crimes to pay for drugs now because they cannot easily obtain
them. If drugs were legal, they say, the enormous profits
associated with drugs because of their illegal status would
evaporate and, once gone, the black market and criminal activity
associated with drugs would also be eliminated. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>If this was really the number one concern of the DEA then they
should be advocating tough prison sentences against alcohol. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. . .
        . </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../govpubs/psycviol.htm">Psychoactive Substances and
Violence</a>, published by the Department of Justice, Series:
Research in Brief, February 1994 </p>

<p>The image of the insanely violent drug user has been a common
argument for drug prohibition since the earliest days of the laws
when the New York Times published front page articles about
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends, New Southern Menace&quot;, and quoted
a sheriff saying, &quot;Those cocaine niggers sure are hard to
kill.&quot; (NY Times, February 17, 1914) It is an image which
has been used to justify the cruelest kinds of responses to
social problems, as shown by the sheriff's own words. It never
did have any basis in fact. </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own research clearly shows that
the only real connection between illegal drugs and violence is
the violence created by the fact that it is illegal. This is the
same kind of violence that we saw with respect to alcohol
Prohibition with the wars between rival alcohol distributors. It
was during this period that the Thompson submachine gun became a
symbol of gangs and Prohibition. All of that ended when
Prohibition ended. Violent crime dropped 65 percent in the year
Prohibition was repealed and it continued to drop every year
thereafter until World War II. (Need citation from Ethan N. on
this one.) We could expect similar results from the repeal of
drug Prohibition. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum, who are experts in
crime and violence, disagreed strongly with the notion that crime
and violence would be reduced if drugs were legalized. It is
widely claimed by those advancing the case for legalization that
crime is largely committed by drug traffickers protecting their
turf. Sadly, it is the experience of many local police officers
that crime is committed not only because people want to buy
drugs, but more often because people use drugs. There is no
denying the fact that drug use changes behavior and exacerbates
criminal activity. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own studies of the issue disagree.
See the information presented above. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts also believe that legalization will lead to
increased availability of drugs, which will, in turn, lead to
increased use. The use of drugs, especially cocaine, crack,
methamphetamine, and PCP is often associated with violent
criminal behavior. There is ample evidence which demonstrates the
links between drugs, violence and crime, and the links between a
currently legal substance--alcohol--and crime is well documented.
Police can attest to the fact that alcohol plays a significant
role in domestic violence cases. Drug use would only swell the
statistics regarding crime, even if the drugs were legally
purchased. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own studies of the issue disagree.
</p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents ignore the fact that the people
committing violent crimes are career criminals who will not stop
their illegal activities once drugs are legalized; they will
instead seek new sources of illicit revenue. Criminal activity
would not be reduced as a result of drug legalization any more
than gangster activity disappeared after the Repeal of
Prohibition. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the argument that if we &quot;legalized&quot; drugs
then the criminals would just find another line of work. There is
nothing else which offers the opportunity to get rich so easily.
By comparison, all the other crimes are hard work. </p>

<p>The DEA says that criminal activity would not be
&quot;reduced&quot; because gangster activity did not
&quot;disappear&quot; after the repeal of Prohibition. Of course,
anyone who has seen &quot;The Untouchables&quot; should know that
gangster activity was significantly &quot;reduced&quot; after the
repeal of Prohibition, even if it did not &quot;disappear&quot;.
Therefore, we could expect similar results again. </p>

<p>This is an interesting argument. We must keep drugs illegal
because it gives work to criminals who might be doing something
more dangerous if we did not. That is, having these people sell
drugs is a good thing because it keeps them out of bigger
trouble. Relatively speaking then, selling drugs is not so bad as
other potential crimes so we should make sure they keep doing it.
</p>

<p>Of course, then the question becomes: What would happen if we
actually did stop the flow of drugs? Would we have to start
manufacturing drugs and distributing them through these same
criminals just to keep them from doing something worse in
society? </p>

<p>According to this argument, we are better off if the drug war
never does succeed. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group discussed the fallacy that legalizing drugs would
eliminate the black market environment which seems to fuel the
drug trade and its attendant violence. The existence of a black
market is heavily dependent on the parameters set by the
legalizers: which drugs would be legal, the potency level of
drugs and the age at which legal drugs could be purchased. If
drugs were legal for persons over 18, for example, drug
traffickers would still target those 17 and younger; if only
marijuana were legalized, drug traffickers would continue to
traffic in heroin and cocaine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Who do the drug traffickers target now? What drugs do they
traffic in now? </p>

<p>No sensible person pretends that any drug policy is going to
solve all the problems related to drugs. That is clearly
unrealistic. At the same time, there is no reason to undertake
policies, such as we have now, which only make the situation
worse. </p>

<p>Let's face it. The DEA never has had any effective control
over the drug markets and they never will. By taking this
approach the DEA has insured that only the outlaws will have
control of drug sales and distribution. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>· A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association
(7/6/94) reports that cocaine use is linked to high rates of
homicide in New York City and that &quot;homicide victims may
have provoked violence through irritability, paranoid thinking or
verbal and physical aggression which are known to be
pharmacologic effects of cocaine.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DOJ's own studies, mentioned above, tell a different
story. </p>

<p>What the DEA is alluding to here in the last part of this
paragraph is the fact that people are more likely to be victims
or homicide than to be perpetrators of homicide while under the
influence of cocaine. The same statistic is true of alcohol. What
it means is that people who get stoned on anything sometimes do
stupid things, such as getting themselves killed. This is even
more true of alcohol, but does not make a good reason to throw
people in prison for drinking wine or beer. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· An April, 1994 report titled &quot;Violent Drug Related
Crime&quot; compiled by Drug and Crime Data Center and
Clearinghouse indicates that drugs are used by many offenders
committing crimes. In 1991, the following percentages of State
prison inmates involved in violent offenses reported that they
had used drugs at the time the offense was committed. </p>

<p>Violent Offenses: 28% </p>

<p>Homicide: 28% </p>

<p>Sexual Assault: 20% </p>

<p>Robbery: 38% </p>

<p>Assault 23% </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Drug and Crime Data Center and Clearinghouse reports that
they have no publication with this title. The Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics of 1992 lists the breakdown of drug
use during commission of violent offenses. The figures shows
that, with the exception of robbery, about 75 to 90 percent of
all the reported drug use was use of alcohol, not illegal drugs.
For robbery, the figures are roughly equal. </p>

<p>People who commit violent crimes are likely to have a lot of
problems in their lives, including use of illegal drugs as well
as higher rates of use of alcohol and tobacco. That doesn't
necessarily mean that one problem is causally related to another.
</p>

<p>Even if we assumed, as the DEA implies, that all of this was
due to illegal drugs, they don't mention comparison data for the
number of people who took whatever drug and did not commit a
violent crime. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed the DEA is right, there is no evidence that
the best way to control the problem is to put people in prison. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· Data from the National Institute of Justice (US Department
of Justice) Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program underscore the
crimedrugs link. Of a sample of males arrested in 24 US cities in
1991, the percent testing positive for at least one drug in the
DUF survey ranged from 36% in Omaha to 75% in San Diego. Among
female arrestees, the percent testing positive for any drug
ranged from 45% in San Antonio to 79% in Cleveland </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The data of the Drug Use Forecasting program is interesting
but it does not underscore the crime-drugs link. The data are
simply measures of the number of people arrested who had drugs in
their system. There is no similar comparative data on people who
were not arrested, or did not commit crimes. </p>

<p>It is also a long way from showing any causal relationship
between drugs and crime except, perhaps, for the fact that people
who are stupid enough to get severely drunk or stoned are prone
to do stupid things. That would not make it a good idea to have
drug prohibition any more than the fact that we arrest people who
are drunk and disorderly makes it a good idea to have alcohol
prohibition. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· A May 1993 Bureau of Justice Statistics report states that
&quot;Drug use was common among inmates serving time for
burglary, robbery or drug offenses. Among inmates serving a
sentence for burglary or robbery, about 6 in 10 inmates had used
drugs in the month before the arrest for the current offense, and
about 4 in 10 were under the influence at the time of the
offense.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of inmates who used drugs in the month before the
arrest is as irrelevant as the number who drank a beer during the
month before the arrest. </p>

<p>It should be noted that being under the influence of drugs is
a convenient excuse which seems to suit everybody involved in a
criminal prosecution. The defendant can plead that he wasn't
himself because he was out of his mind on drugs and thereby play
on the court's sympathies for leniency. The prosecutors can point
to another horrendous drug problem, which suits their interests
as well. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The same study indicates that female inmates were more likely
than male inmates to have used drugs in the month before the
offense (54% versus 50%) and to have been under the influence at
the time of the offense (36% versus 31 %). </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>How does this show that we ought to have a general program to
imprison women who use drugs? </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Another finding of the study indicated that among 18-49 year
old males, those who had used alcohol, cannabis and cocaine at
some point during the past year were ten times more likely to
commit a violent act (26.1 percent versus 2.7 percent) than those
who used none of the above. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA conveniently ignores the fact that alcohol has the
highest association with violence and that cannabis (hemp) has
none. </p>

<p>The DEA contends that, because someone had a beer up to a year
ago, they are potentially violent today. </p>

<p>There is no evidence of a causal relationship here at all.
Even if there was, there is no evidence that prison would be the
best way to control drug use. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D., president of a major New York
City drug treatment center, Phoenix House, and chairman of the
New York State Advisory Council on Substance Abuse, notes that
one of the basic contentions of advocates of legalization is that
drug users are essentially normal people. Actually, Dr. Rosenthal
said in a speech in 1993, drugs undo the bounds that keep many
seemingly normal people on an even keel. &quot;The treatment
community does not contend that society is at risk from the
behavior of all drug abusers or even the great majority of
them,&quot; he said. &quot;The case for prohibition rests on the
substantial number of abusers who cross the line from permissible
self-destruction to become 'driven' people, who are 'out of
control' and put others in danger of their risk taking, violence,
abuse or HIV infection.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA argues that drug users are not &quot;essentially
normal people&quot;, even while they state that at least
two-thirds of them are gainfully employed taxpayers. </p>

<p>As for undoing &quot;the bounds that keep many seemingly
normal people on an even keel&quot; and all the other problems
mentioned, these problems are equally true of alcohol. Yet they
do not recommend that we bring back Prohibition of alcohol. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together, as if they
all had the same effects. General statements about
&quot;all&quot; drugs are intentionally misleading. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· The International Association of Chiefs of Police published
a report in 1993 titled &quot;Violent Crime in America.&quot; It
states &quot;Drug abuse and crime, both violent and nonviolent,
are linked. National Crime Victimization surveys in 1989 and 1990
revealed over 2,000,000 crimes committed by offenders under the
influence of drugs or alcohol...this represented 36% and 34% of
total violent crime recorded by the surveys.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The important phrase here is &quot;drugs or alcohol&quot;. The
table below shows that alcohol's association with violent crime
is far greater than the association of all illegal drugs
combined. The biggest problem is alcohol, and yet no one is
suggesting that we have a war on booze. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together as if they
were all equally responsible for the problems. It is
irresponsible and misleading to lump all drugs together,
particularly in view of the large role that alcohol plays in the
figures. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· Bureau of Justice Statistics surveys indicate that
&quot;25% of convicted inmates in jails, 33% of state prisoners,
and 40% of youths in stateoperated facilities admit being under
the influence of an illegal drug at the time of their
offense.&quot; (BJS, Drug and Crime Facts, 1992) </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>One reason is that a large number of them are in jail for
selling illegal drugs. </p>

<p>Again, it is misleading to lump all drugs together as if they
were all equally responsible and to imply a causal relationship. </p>

<p>The more complete figures, in the table below, show a somewhat
different picture. </p>

<h3>Some Effects of Illegal Drugs </h3>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA's table of the effects of illegal drugs is a notable
example of their failure to consider the whole picture. The table
does not include any information on the effects of either alcohol
or tobacco for comparison, even though these drugs are clearly
the bigger problems in our society. </p>
