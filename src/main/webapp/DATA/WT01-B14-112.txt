<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>
While many western commentators believe that Russia has a cultural
history which will discourage entrepreneurship and establishment
of a successful private sector, <B>it is important to remember
that Russia was a high growth economy during the decade before
the First World War.</B> With her large natural resource endowment
and well educated population, Russia should be able to duplicate
the 6-7% growth rates now apparent in Poland, Estonia, and other
former communist countries in eastern Europe. But such take-off
will not happen without further action to address core structural
problems, such as the integrity of the tax system and government
agencies in general. There will probably also be a debate about
whether the strength of the ruble is discouraging exports and
boosting imports excessively. After the devaluation of 1992, the
ruble stood at barely 10% of its purchasing power parity with
the dollar. At the end of 1995, it was 65% of its PPP value against
the dollar and it will probably soon reach a level equal to 75-80%
of its PPP value against the dollar. As Russian industry is still
in the midst of a major restructuring and trying to develop export
markets to compensate for the collapse of domestic spending, there
will probably be a powerful lobby arguing for a larger devaluation
of the ruble than Mr. Yeltsin's policy team and the IMF have so
far advocated.
<P>
As a result of the economic upturn now occurring in both the G-7
countries and the developing countries adversely affected by Mexico's
1995 financial crisis, the world economy should enjoy a growth
rate in excess of 4.0% this year for the first time since 1988.
As the recovery in Europe and Japan is much less mature than the
six year old recovery in the U.S., there is no reason why global
output growth should not remain above 4.0% next year as well.
<P>
<B>The global scope of the current upturn is reviving concerns
last heard during 1994 about the adequacy of global savings to
finance a resurgence of investment in the old-industrial countries
as well as the emerging market economies which now encompass about
45% of the world' output, 70% of its land area, and 85% of its
population.</B> The world economy's major source of surplus savings
during recent years has been the current account surplus of east
Asia while its largest consumer of savings has been the western
hemisphere. In 1995, Japan had a current account surplus of $110
billion, China had a current account surplus of $16 billion, Singapore
had a surplus of $11 billion and Taiwan had a surplus of $5 billion
compared to an aggregate current account deficit of $40 billion
in Korea and the other countries of Asean. In the western hemisphere,
by contrast, the U.S. and Canada had a current account deficit
of $160 billion while Latin America ran a deficit of $28 billion.
Latin America's deficit fell sharply from $45 billion during 1994
because of the Mexican crisis but Brazil, Columbia and Peru expanded
their borrowing modestly. Europe is far closer to financial equilibrium
than either Asia or the western hemisphere. Germany and Britain
had a current account deficit of $27 billion last year but this
was more than offset by current account surpluses of $27 billion
in the Benelux countries, $17 billion in France and $20 billion
in Italy.
<P>
In 1996, there will be large declines in the current account surpluses
of Japan and China while the deficit of the western hemisphere
will probably remain unchanged. The deficit of the U.S. will shrink
modestly but Latin America will expand its borrowing. The only
offset to the reduced surplus of east Asia will be a larger surplus
in Western Europe as the deficit of Germany shrinks while the
surpluses of other countries linger at high levels. But with eastern
Europe and Russia now poised for faster growth, the Visegard countries
will probably run a current account deficit of $8-10 while Russia
could shift from a large external surplus in 1995 to a small deficit
next by 1997.
<P>
The heavy emphasis on reduction of government borrowing in the
major industrial countries today suggests the coming shift in
the composition of the world's balance of payments should pose
fewer interest rate risks than the world economic upturn which
occurred during 1994 . <B>But the revival of capital flows to
Latin America, the large external deficits of the traditional
high savings societies of southeast Asia and the re-appearance
of eastern Europe as a major borrower indicates that some of the
upward pressure on real interest rates this year is a response
to changes in the global savings and investment balance, not just
concerns about rising inflation.</B> As a result of the Mexican
crisis many developing countries in Latin America and elsewhere
are putting much greater emphasis on boosting their domestic savings
rates and thus reducing their need for external capital. But it
is still unclear if savings rates will rise rapidly enough during
the next few years to satisfy all of the capital demands which
will develop as the global business cycle matures.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, the strength of U.S. data for employment,
retail sales and industrial production have increased the odds
that the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest rates by
25 basis points this summer. The hike could also come in between
the next two FOMC meetings in order to avoid a conflict with the
Democratic National Convention in late August. The U.S. economy
will probably grow at a 3.5-4.5% annual rate during the third
quarter and hold in a growth range close to 3.0% during the second
half of the year. Inflation will not accelerate dramatically but
another three quarters of above trend growth would reduce unemployment
to 4.0% and encourage a revival of industrial commodity prices.
