<H3>DOE ANNOUNCES SECOND PAYMENTS
FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION</H3><P>


	The U. S. Department of Energy today announced the 1996 incentive payments to renewable energy generation facilities under the Renewable Energy Production Incentive (REPI) program.  Four state-owned, six city-owned, and one cooperative-owned facility received a total of $2,398,472 in incentive payments to produce electricity from renewable energy sources in fiscal year 1995.<P>
	REPI, established to advance the commercialization and use of renewable energy electricity generation systems in the U. S.,  provides incentive payments of $0.015 per kilowatt-hour (after adjustment for inflation from the base year of 1993).  Qualified state- or local government-owned facilities or non-profit electrical cooperatives which generate and sell electricity using solar, wind, biomass and certain types of geothermal resources can participate in the program.<P>

	"This nation's non-profit and municipal utilities are forging a path we hope all utilities will follow one day," said Christine Ervin, assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy.  "They are helping accelerate the commercial viability of renewable energy technologies for utility use, and they are helping bring about a cleaner environment and improved energy security for all of us."<P>
	The total energy produced by these utilities using wind, solar and biomass in fiscal year 1995 was 152,609,779 kilowatt-hours.  Of the eleven facilities that applied for, and received, production incentive payments, two use wind and four use photovoltaic solar energy sources.  The remaining five facilities use methane to produce electricity.<P>
	Utilities seeking to qualify for payment for energy produced during fiscal year 1996 may apply through Dec. 31.  Potential applicants should see the final rule published in the Federal Register on July 19, 1995 or call Jim Spaeth, REPI project manager, DOE Golden Field Office, at (303) 275-4706.  In addition, DOE soon will publish supplemental interpretations and procedures in the Federal Register for future applicants for the renewable energy production incentive.<P>
