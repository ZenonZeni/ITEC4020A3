<h3>My Bio</h3>
<p>
As Policy Analyst for the <a href = "http://www.cdt.org">Center for Democracy and Technology</a>, Mr. Seiger performs research and analysis on telecommunications infrastructure and communications privacy issues. Current issues include Congressional efforts to regulate content on the Internet (the Exon/Coats CDA and other proposals),  cryptography policy, and the implementation of the 'Digital Telephony" legislation.  Mr. Seiger also works with Congressional Staff and Industry representatives to develop alternative policies for the Internet which maximize freedom of expression and privacy.
<p>
As CDT's online organizer, Mr. Seiger has pioneered the use of the 
Internet as a means of grass-roots organizing and public education. In 
June of 1996, Mr. Seiger worked with Senator Burns to put the <a href = 
"http://www.crypto.com/hearing-6-26-96/">first Congressional Hearing on 
the Internet</a>. Mr. Seiger has played a key role in organizing several 
high profile online demonstrations, including an <a href = "http 
://www.cdt.org/petition.html">online petition</a> which generated over 
115,000 signatures in opposition to the Exon Communications Decency Act, and a <a href = "http://politicsusa.com/PoliticsUSA/news/1214pm05.html.cgi">"National Day of Protest"</a>  which generated over 20,000 phone calls, faxes and email messages to members of Congress on December 12, 1995, and the <a href = "http://www.cdt.org/speech.html">"Black Thursday Protest"</a> in which over 2000 World Wide Web sites went black to protest the enactment of the CDA.  Mr. Seiger also  writes and edits CDT Policy Posts, the Center's online newsletter.
<p>
Mr. Seiger's publications have appeared in <a href = "http://www.wired.com/wired/4.12/crn/index.html">Wired Magazine</a>, Communications of the ACM, Security Management, and others.
<p>
Prior to joining CDT, Mr. Seiger was Project Coordinator at the <a href = 
"http://www.eff.org"> Electronic Frontier Foundation </a>, and also 
worked with Representative Edward Markey at the House  Telecommunications 
Subcommittee. <p>
Mr. Seiger is a native of Palo Alto California, and holds a B.A. in 
Psychology and Studies in Religion from the <a href = "http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>.

<h3>When I am not working (when is that again?)</h3>
