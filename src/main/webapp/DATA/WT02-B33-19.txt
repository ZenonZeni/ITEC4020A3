JAPAN BEGINS F-2 PRODUCTION IN $246-BILLION BUDGET PLAN

By:
EIICHIRO SEKIGAWA

(TOKYO)
Finance Minister Takemura Masayoshi has succeeded in reducing the Japanese
Defense Agency's budget to $246.6 billion, or $6 billion below the JDA's
request, but the new five-year plan will still offer 6.6% growth above
current spending levels.
The 1996-2000 procurement plan will include nearly $42 billion for major
weapon systems, but that is $1.57 billion less than the five-year plan just
ending.
   The cutbacks include a reduction in the total purchase of FS-X fighters
from the 141 recently sought by the air force to the 130 originally
planned.
   A close air support fighter based on the Lockheed Martin F-16C/D, the
FS-X has officially left the experimental stage and has been renamed the
F-2. It will replace the Mitsubishi F-1.
   THE AIR FORCE APPEARS to have staved off calls for F-2 production
numbers to drop as low as 80 to reflect a reduced threat in the post-Cold
War era. As part of its lobbying effort, the service pumped up its request
by 11 aircraft, ostensibly to benefit the Blue Impulse acrobatic team and
reserve forces. But the addition was padding, in part to make projected
unit costs look better. The first 12 production aircraft are expected to be
funded in fiscal 1996 and will cost about $120 million each. A full
procurement will reduce that number to about $80 million each.
   The F-2 flew for the first time in October. An entry into service is set
for 1999.
   The F-2 cutback was expected. A more interesting casualty was the air
force's proposal to introduce Japan's first airborne refueling and troop
transport aircraft, which would have given the Japanese the potential to
extend their air power for greater involvement in international
peacekeeping efforts.
   That proposal has been tabled, for the time being, but may be taken up
again in three years during a midterm review of the five-year defense
plan.
   The air force has tried for years to acquire tankers to extend the range
of its fighters for interdiction missions. But political constraints,
particularly from the Socialist and Communists parties, have blocked the
purchases out of concern that Asian nations would fear a resurgence of
Japanese nationalist aggression. The Socialists' objections, plus the
Finance Ministry's opposition because of the program's costs, have again
prevailed.
   Another casualty was a Defense Agency request for an advanced technology
fighter demonstrator. Lack of funds has reduced that effort to powerplant
studies. The JDA expects to revive the effort in the 2001-2005 budget
plan.
   The new force buildup is part of Japan's first rewrite of its military
strategy in 19 years. The new policy advocates smaller forces but says
Japan must help assure stability in East Asia. It also describes military
assistance in rescue missions, natural disaster relief and anti-terrorism
campaigns.
   The new plan does not call for additional Lockheed/Kawasaki P-3C
antisubmarine patrol aircraft. Instead, a replacement will be sought.
Besides an ASW role, the new aircraft is to have a capability for surface
tracking of ships as the navy picks up more roles traditionally reserved
for civilian authorities (in this case, smuggling and illegal
immigration).
   The P-3C multitask replacement aircraft is expected to be introduced
after the turn of the century.
   Left unmentioned is a replacement for the Mitsubishi T-2 trainer, a Mach
1.6 aircraft from which the F-1 was derived. The T-2's design service life
is nearly over. Between 1969 and 1986, Mitsubishi built 96 T-2s.
   The five-year plan calls for installation of advanced phased-array
radars built by Mitsubishi Electric for the F-15J. The same radar is to be
used in the F-2.
   At the navy's request, ShinMaywa is planning an improved US-1A amphibian
search-and-rescue aircraft with higher thrust engines. ShinMaywa has been
campaigning the US-1A for civilian applications throughout the Asia-Pacific
region.
   A replacement for the air force's 31 Kawasaki C-1 medium troop/cargo
transports also is being sought.
   Budget highlights:
  -- Although force consolidation prevails throughout the army, the
Paratroop Group, Helicopter Group and eight Hawk surface-to-air missile
groups remain as they are.
  -- The 12th Div. will be shifted from a ground force to an air mobile
force, signaling a need for a helicopter transport buildup.
  -- The navy's land-based antisubmarine warfare aircraft will be reduced
from 16 units to 13.
  -- The navy's tactical aircraft will be reduced from about 220 to 170.
  -- The air force's three F-2 fighter squadrons, reconnaissance unit,
three air transport units, AWACs patrols and six Patriot missile batteries
are retained as is.
  -- But one of today's 10 interceptor fighter forces will be eliminated.
  -- Tactical aircraft numbers will drop from 430 to 400, with a
corresponding drop in fighters from about 350 to 300.
  -- Personnel will be reduced in favor of automation at 20 of 28 air
defense radar sites.

NASA COUNTERS RUSSIAN PLAN TO CUT STATION COSTS

By:
JOSEPH C. ANSELMO

(WASHINGTON)
   NASA has rejected Russian Space Agency proposals to build the
international space station around Russia's orbiting Mir station, but has
countered with a proposal it believes would significantly reduce Moscow's
up-front commitment.
   During six days of meetings in Houston just before Christmas, NASA
officials outlined an ambitious, multifaceted plan to their Russian
counterparts that would allow the RSA to delay or modify its contribution
of several large components to the international project without
substantially altering the station's design or initial assembly schedule.
   The proposals would significantly reduce the number of Russian launches
during the initial assembly phase of the international station and allow
Mir to continue to be utilized for scientific missions until at least
2000.
   The Russian station, which was orbited in 1986, was scheduled to shut
down when assembly on the international station began in November, 1997.
But it has lasted longer than expected.
   Russian officials do not want to abandon Mir before its life ends, but
they also don't have the money or launch capability to conduct station
assembly flights and resupply Mir at the same time. That dilemma led to two
proposals the Russians made in Houston to connect the early elements of the
international station to Mir (AW&ST Dec. 11, 1995, p. 35).
   Among the key points in NASA's counterproposal, according to sources:
  -- Russia would build and launch the station service module on the third
assembly flight in April, 1998, as scheduled. RSA officials had proposed
delaying the module, which is critical to the station's early assembly
sequence, or making modifications that might cause a delay.
  -- Delivery of three Russian research modules and a Science Power
Platform (SPP) to power them would be delayed for several years. Roll
control that would have been provided to the station by the SPP could be
provided instead by a boom similar to the one that provides roll control on
Mir. NASA and RSA will also examine the feasibility of transferring two
newer Mir science modules, Spektr and Priroda, to the international station
in place of the brand new research modules.
   Orbiting and outfitting the SPP and its arrays would have required six
launches on Proton boosters, and the three research labs would have
required three additional launches. The substitute boom will require only
two Russian launches.
  -- Russian launches would be further reduced by using the space shuttle,
instead of Russia's Soyuz vehicle, for changing out crews after
human-tended capability is reached. NASA officials believe the shuttle can
accommodate the additional 1,800 lb. that would be added to station
assembly flights to transport crews. Russian cosmonaut requirements on the
international station would also be reduced until its research modules were
delivered.
  -- NASA's Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center would expand
its role during the assembly sequence. RSA officials had said their control
center in Moscow would be overburdened handling both its share of station
assembly and Mir.
  -- NASA will consider extending ``Phase 1'' scientific and engineering
experiments on Mir into 1998 or 1999, which would mean increased payment to
Moscow for ``rent'' of the facility.
   Russian officials had complained they were responsible for too much of
the early elements of station assembly. NASA's plan is aimed at
significantly delaying much of that contribution without affecting the
design or assembly of U.S., European, Japanese or Canadian components.
Russia is not the first station partner with money problems. In fact, Japan
is the only one that has not reduced its commitment.
   IN RELATED NEWS, prime station contractor Boeing said damage to a flight
article for the FGB space tug--which is being paid for by NASA but is
scheduled to be built and launched by Russia--will not delay its planned
launch in November, 1997, as the first station element.
   Boeing said an error by a Russian test operator caused a pressure
differential that damaged the FGB's internal bulkhead and elements of three
forward sections of its pressurized instrument module.

BOEING MOVES AHEAD WITH SEA LAUNCH VENTURE

By:
JOSEPH C. ANSELMO

(WASHINGTON)
A hefty order from Hughes and a key regulatory go-ahead from the U.S.
government has allowed Boeing to move full speed ahead with a unique
international partnership to launch payloads from a sea-based platform.
   The Sea Launch venture between Boeing, Russia's RSC Energia, Ukraine's
NPO Yuzhnoye and Kvaerner Group, a Norwegian ship builder, was first made
public last April (AW&ST Apr. 17, 1995, p. 25).
   Boeing officials, however, had been unclear for several months whether
the U.S. government would permit them to conduct enough launches to make
the $500-million venture commercially viable.
   Approval finally came last month, when the Clinton Administration gave
Sea Launch permission to conduct at least 11 geosynchronous launches and
possibly 14 through the end of 2001 as part of a launch agreement with
Ukraine (AW&ST Dec. 18/25, 1995, p. 97).
   THE ADMINISTRATION decided to fold Sea Launch into the agreement because
it will employ two stages from Ukraine's Zenit booster. Boeing had objected
to being covered under the Ukrainian quotas. But company officials now say
they can live with the number of launches they have been allowed.
   Another key piece of the puzzle fell into place last month with the
finalization of a commitment from Hughes Space and Communications to
purchase at least 10 launches. That deal, worth about $1 billion with
options, provided Boeing and its partners with the financial impetus to
proceed.
   The launch venture is also discussing launch services with another U.S.
satellite manufacturer and hopes to announce a deal within two months,
according to Sea Launch President Ronald C. Olson.
   Sea Launch plans to use a complex mix of booster components and support
equipment from around the globe to offer launch services from a converted
31,000-ton North Sea oil rig.
   Besides the two stages from Ukraine's Zenit booster, the venture plans
to use a Russian Block DM upper stage. The stages would be shipped
piecemeal to the U.S., where they would be integrated with American-built
fairings and adaptors. Launches would take place in the Pacific Ocean in
international waters south of Hawaii.
   The oil rig is currently being converted to a launch platform in Norway,
while a Sea Launch command and control ship is under construction at a
shipyard in Scotland.
   Sea Launch plans to orbit its first payload, a yet-to-be-designated
Hughes satellite, in 1998. The venture plans at least one other launch that
year, and ultimately hopes to ramp up to 6-8 launches a year, Olson said.
   The Sea Launch booster is designed to carry 12,000 lb. of payload to
geosynchronous orbit. That would allow it to orbit a next-generation Hughes
HS-702 satellite with room to spare for a smaller, piggybacked payload.
   Olson said he believes his company's main competitor will be Europe's
Arianespace consortium.
   ``We're not going after [U.S.] government or NASA business,'' he said.
``Our goal is to take market share away from Arianespace. Right now they
enjoy about 60% of the market share. We'd like to get that percentage back
in the United States.''
Olson said Boeing will hold the largest share of Sea Launch, 40%, while
Russia's RSC Energia will hold a 25% share, the Norwegian Kvaerner Group a
20% stake and Ukraine's NPO Yuzhnoye 15%.
   Energia's share is larger than Yuzhnoye's because 60% of the Zenit's
components actually come from Russia, including its Energomash-supplied
engines, Olson said.
   He said Sea Launch is negotiating to establish a ``home port'' for its
ship and an assembly facility in Long Beach, Calif.

RADARSAT DELIVERS FIRST SAR IMAGE

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
Canada's Radarsat 1 satellite has delivered its first data for an image
using a synthetic aperture radar to survey Cape Breton Island in Nova
Scotia at night through cloud cover and rain.
   Data for the first image released last month was gathered in late
November. It is possible to see the effects of high winds on the water
surface since the waves generated strong radar returns (see bright area in
upper left of image). The image covers an area 132-km. wide and it was
taken from an altitude of 156 km.
   Dennis M. Nazarenko, manager of application solutions at Radarsat
International, said the images are close to specifications. The satellite
is not in its final orbit yet, and data-processing software is still being
fine-tuned.
   John Hornsby, Radarsat International's director of operations, said the
company is still in the early phase of commissioning the satellite, which
will take about three months. Radarsat expects to begin providing images
for commercial use in mid-February. The satellite was launched on Nov. 4.
   Radarsat plans to certify ground stations in Norway, the United Kingdom
and Singapore after tests of acquisition and processing capabilities
starting early this month. Hornsby said he expects a number of other ground
stations to come on line in 1996. Stations may be commissioned in
Australia, Africa and Brazil, and there is also interest in China and
Japan.
   Hornsby said Radarsat International is already studying possible
improvements that might be made in a second satellite. Some long lead time
hardware will probably be ordered for Radarsat 2 later this year.
   Radarsat International worked with Spar Aerospace Ltd. to design, build
and launch the satellite under the aegis of the Canadian Space Agency. Ball
Aerospace & Technologies Corp. built the spacecraft bus.

ATLAS SETS RECORD

(CAPE CANAVERAL)
Lockheed Martin capped a record year of space launches in 1995 when its
Atlas-Centaur successfully orbited Hughes' Galaxy 3R satellite to serve the
direct-to-home television market throughout Latin America.
   Atlas-Centaur 120 lifted off Pad 36A here on time at 1923 EST, Dec. 14.
The Atlas 2A vehicle had a smooth ascent, and about 29 min. after launch
the Centaur upper stage separated to leave the HS-601 satellite in its
geosynchronous transfer orbit.
   The launch was the 11th of an Atlas-Centaur vehicle from Complex 36 here
in 1995. That was the most Atlases ever launched in one year.
   Hughes Space and Communications Co. engineers took more than 4 hr. to
gain full communications with the spacecraft after it reached that orbit.
Hughes officials were unavailable to explain the delay.
   The satellite was expected to take about 10 days to maneuver to its
geosynchronous station at 95 W. Long., after which it is to undergo several
weeks of testing before becoming operational in January.
   Galaxy 3R has 24 C-band transponders that will be used to provide
broadcast programming to the continental U.S. It also has 24 Ku-band
transponders that will be used by Galaxy Latin America to deliver DirecTV
entertainment programming to Mexico, Central and South America, and the
Caribbean. Galaxy Latin America is a joint venture of Hughes firms in
Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil.

MILSTAR COMPLETES FIRST CROSS-LINK TRANSMISSION

(LOS ANGELES)
The Milstar satellite system has made its first cross-link communication by
transmitting a message from one Milstar spacecraft to another without the
use of a ground relay facility.
   The cross-link capability supports the existing Milstar low data rate
payload and the planned medium data rate system being developed for Block 2
Milstars.
   Cross-linking enables a message to be routed around the Milstar
satellite constellation for downlink to a destination terminal. The system
provides secure inter-satellite communications by using specific
frequencies and high-gain, narrow-beam antennas, program officials said.
   The first cross-linked message was uplinked from the Military Command
Center in Virginia Dec. 15 through the first Milstar satellite, development
flight satellite-1 (DFS-1), which was placed in orbit in February, 1994.
The message then was relayed directly to the second of two Block 1
spacecraft launched in November. Development flight satellite-2 downlinked
the message to Pacific Command in Hawaii.
   The two spacecraft combined have a cross-link coverage extending from
Europe and Africa to beyond the Hawaiian Islands, program officials said.
   Milstar's cross-linking capability is intended to provide a worldwide
communications capability when the constellation is completed around the
turn of the century, with four spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit, program
officials said.
   The third spacecraft is scheduled to be completed in 1998, while the
last three Milstar 2s are set for delivery in 1999, 2000 and 2001.
   The medium data rate payload was added to Block 2 satellites as a result
of a program restructuring in 1991. Lockheed Martin is prime contractor for
Milstar. TRW and Hughes provide the low and medium data rate payloads,
respectively.

EUROPEAN AIRFRAMERS MERGE TO BUILD MUSCLE
Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace forming Aero International
Regional to position themselves for the future in an overcrowded regional
aircraft market

By:
PIERRE SPARACO

(TOULOUSE)
   Aero International Regional, a company jointly established by
Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace, is paving the way for a major
consolidation in the regional aircraft market.
   AIR will be formed this week to streamline the three partners' wide
range of 29-115-seat regional commercial transports. In the long term, AIR
plans to launch all-new aircraft, although no specific timeframe has been
determined yet.
   Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace each own a 33.3% stake in
AIR, a company headquartered in Toulouse.
   ``A major European [aircraft manufacturer] is born. The joint venture is
open to new partners, European and from outside Europe,'' AIR Chief
Executive Officer Henri-Paul Puel said.
   AIR, although not expected to cut excess production capacity soon, is
paving the way for a unified organization holding a major share in the
regional aircraft market. However, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) and
Fokker, its Dutch affiliate, are not involved and remain AIR's competitors,
as does Sweden's Saab-Scania, a stand-alone regional aircraft producer.
   ``AIR's doors are wide open to welcome DASA. We cannot envisage building
[regional transports] in Europe without the Germans,'' Puel said.
``However, I am not sure Fokker still does exist,'' he cynically added,
referring to the Dutch manufacturer's deep financial difficulties.
   During the next 2-4 years, AIR's priority will be to market and support
existing products still manufactured by the founding partners, including
enhanced derivatives. In the U.S., AIR Marketing Inc. of Chantilly, Va.,
will succeed ATR's North American sales branch. Product support will be
handled by AIR Support Inc. of Sterling, Va.
AIR's product range comprises:
  -- Jetstream twin turboprops. Jetstream Aircraft, a Scotland-based
British Aerospace subsidiary, is producing the 29-seat Jetstream 41 twin
turboprop transport. Jetstream concluded orders for 103 41s and delivered
67 aircraft to eight operators in 1995. Although the 19-seat Jetstream 31
is still being marketed, production was recently terminated and additional
aircraft will now be manufactured to order only.
  -- ATR twin turboprops. Avions de Transport Regional, a Toulouse-based
Aerospatiale-Alenia consortium, is producing 48-66-seat ATR42/72 twin
turboprop transports and enhanced derivatives such as the higher
performance ATR42-500. ATR has received orders for 290 ATR42s and delivered
284 aircraft. The consortium sold 172 ATR72s and delivered 160 aircraft.
Late last month, the combined ATR42/72 backlog was only 18 aircraft, a low
level tied to weak sales in 1995. However, major orders are currently being
negotiated, Puel claimed.
  -- Avro jet transports. Woodford-based Avro International Aerospace,
also a British Aerospace subsidiary, produces 70-115-seat, four-engine
RJ70, RJ85, RJ100 and RJ115 transports. In 1993, the enhanced RJ line
succeeded British Aerospace BAe-146 models with the same capacities. Avro
has received orders for 95 RJs and delivered 46 aircraft.
   THIS YEAR, THE AIR partners plan to produce about 100 aircraft,
comprising 25 Jetstream 41s, 25 RJs and 50 ATRs, generating sales estimated
at $1.2 billion, Puel said.
   This week, AIR will establish an integrated management staff, located in
ATR's corporate headquarters building next to Toulouse airport. The
French-based management, marketing and product support services will have
about 700 employees. In addition, nearly 100 employees will be based in
Italy, 50 in the U.S. and 50 in the Pacific Rim. The integration is
scheduled to extend over the 1996-98 period, company officials said.
   The three partners' product support activities are scheduled to be
combined on June 1. By the end of the year, unified spare part activities
will be established at Weybridge in the U.K. Training facilities, including
flight simulators, will be transferred gradually to Naples, Italy.
   NEARLY 200 CARRIERS around the world currently operate more than 1,450
aircraft produced by AIR's partners. ATR, Jetstream and Avro delivered more
than 1,200 regional aircraft. In addition, AIR will also support earlier
aircraft types such as 50-seat Hawker Siddeley HS-748s, 70-seat British
Aerospace Jetstream 61s/ATPs and 19-seat Jetstream 31s, an AIR official
said.
   The new company's scope is scheduled to expand broadly when all-new
programs are launched. Before the agreement to form AIR, ATR planned to
develop an 80-seat twin turboprop transport, known as the ATR82. And Avro
was considering a twinjet derivative of the RJ, expected to be equipped
with CFM56 Lite turbofan engines planned by CFM International, a General
Electric-Snecma joint company. Such new concepts are now scheduled to be
replaced by AIR-developed aircraft.
   Launching an all-new, 100-seat twinjet could become AIR's first major
initiative, company officials acknowledged. However, the future of such a
concept is tied to the outcome of the proposed AE-100 Asian Express
program. Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) and the Korean Commercial
Aircraft Development Consortium (KCDC) have not decided yet on a Western
partner for the 100-seat-category twinjet (AW&ST Oct. 16, 1995, p. 23).
   Last month, AIR formed Beijing-based Aero International Asia. DASA and
Fokker are promoting a rival concept, and two U.S. manufacturers, Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas, also submitted offerings.
   AVIC and KCDC planned to select a Western partner in September, but
delayed their decision and are now planning a two-step selection procedure.
Two finalists are expected to be retained, and the winner will be selected
a few weeks later.
   AVIC and KCDC plan to offer a 5-6% share in the AE-100 to an additional
partner, Singapore Aerospace or Hindustan Aeronautics, before the program
is formally launched.
   ``If a U.S. manufacturer wins, the Europeans will think seriously about
launching their own [100-seat twinjet] program,'' Antonio Di Blasi said. He
is AIR senior vice president-projects and strategic marketing.
   At this stage, the planned AE-100 program is resulting in increasingly
complex issues. Chinese and Korean industry officials apparently
underestimated the numerous problems that must be resolved before such a
global undertaking can materialize, a French official pointed out. In
addition, Alenia, AIR's Italian arm, is a risk-sharing partner in the newly
launched 100-seat McDonnell Douglas MD-95 twinjet transport.
   The AE-100's basic model, a 108-seat aircraft, will be followed by a
shortened, 95-seat derivative and a stretched, 137-seat version, AVIC
Managing Director Gao Zhanmin recently said. The twinjet, as currently
envisioned by AVIC's Beijing-based engineering team, would have a
50-metric-ton (110,000-lb.) maximum takeoff weight, Mach 0.78 cruise speed
and 1,500-km. (810-naut.-mi.) range at maximum payload. No engine type has
been specified yet.
   According to a French industry official, an all-new 100-seat twinjet
will be economically justified if it can offer direct operating costs at
least 10% below those of existing aircraft such as the Fokker 100 and the
Avro RJ or newly-launched programs--Boeing's 737-600 and McDonnell Douglas'
MD-95.
   AIR participants are considering a five-abreast cabin configuration. The
resulting aircraft would not compete with the wider-fuselage, 124-seat
A319, the Airbus Industrie consortium's smallest aircraft, the French
official said.

aircraft manufacturers from Europe and elsewhere. They specifically

NEW RUSSIAN MIGS SET FOR FLIGHT TEST

By:
NICOLAY NOVICHKOV
CRAIG COVAULT

(MOSCOWPARIS)
The Russian Mikoyan design bureau, now being merged into the MAPO-MiG
industrial group, opens 1996 preparing for the first flights of both its
advanced fighter and MiG-AT trainer.
   The imminent flights will mark the first completely new aircraft to be
tested by the famed Mikoyan organization since the MiG-29 first flew 15
years ago.
   Mikoyan officials are planning the AT's scheduled first takeoff by Jan.
20 and the new fighter's initial flight also early this year.
   The tests will be conducted at the Ramenskoye Flight Test Center near
Moscow, where the aircraft were making final high-speed taxi runs in late
December. Mikoyan chief test pilot, Taskayev Roman, will fly both
aircraft.
   In addition to the initial flights with the new fighter and trainer,
MAPO-MiG will accelerate midair refueling tests with MiG-29M aircraft,
which earlier could not be refueled in flight. The Russian air force hopes
to buy 30 MiG-29Ms with the new refueling capability this year.
   MAPO-MiG also plans to redesignate newer versions of the MiG-29M as the
MiG-33, although there will be no differences in flight hardware between
the two designations.
   The revival of MiG flight test activity is being aided by a rejuvenated
Mikoyan financial/industrial base. The new business foundation stems from
the design bureau's merger with MAPO, the Moscow Aircraft Production
Organization that built MiG aircraft during the Soviet era. Several banks
are also part of the organization, which has been designated a
``financial/industrial group'' under Russian law.
   Vladimir Kuzmin, who earlier headed MAPO, is director general of the new
organization. He shares some of that overall responsibility with Rostislav
Belyakov, who headed Mikoyan as its general designer. Belyakov, who has
been battling ill health, has a direct management line to the head of
design/development, Anatoliy Belosvet.
   A recent influx of funding from the Russian Ministry of Defense for
flight test of the new advanced fighter will also help the company, Russian
sources said.
   The aircraft, informally called the MiG-1.42, carries the official
designation of MFI (loosely translated as ``multifunction fighter''). The
twin-engine MFI is designed to be both a military and commercial competitor
to the Lockheed Martin F-22, the Eurofighter 2000 and the Dassault Rafale.
The Russian aircraft has 16 control surfaces, including canards and a twin
tail, that are driven by a fly-by-wire system. It was initially to have
flown in 1995, but funding problems and the need to conduct further testing
on control system actuators pushed the scheduled first flight into early
1996.
   The aircraft is to have supersonic cruise (``supercruise'') capability
and limited stealth characteristics.
   If the fighter has a successful flight test program, it would not enter
service until after 2000. In contrast, the new MiG-AT trainer would begin
field evaluations at a Russian air force school within a few months of its
initial flight, if selected by the Defense Ministry over the Yakovlev Yak/
AEM-130, a competing trainer.
   Through late December, the AT had completed at least five high-speed
taxi tests. Like the new fighter, the AT was to have flown in 1995 but was
slowed by funding delays.
   Russia plans to buy 250-300 trainers to replace its current Czech-built
L -29 and L-39 aircraft. The winner will also have export opportunities,
and already India and Uzbekistan have signed options to procure the new
trainer.
   MAPO-MiG IS WORKING with France's Snecma and Turbomeca, which will
supply the AT's twin Larzac engines. Export versions, to be marketed by
Snecma, would also have a Sextant Avionique/Gosniias glass cockpit.
Yakovlev is teamed with Italy's Aermacchi for development of the
Yak/AEM-130, which has a fly-by-wire control system and two Klimov turbofan
engines (AW&ST June 26, 1995, p. 26).
   Details emerging from the Russian Defense Ministry indicated a split
over which aircraft is favored. At least some senior air force managers
have expressed a preference for the Yak/AEM-130, but Russian Air Defense
Force (PVO) officers earlier liked the MiG-AT (AW&ST Sept. 12, 1994, p.
43).
   While the MiG-AT is set to fly by Jan. 20, the Yak/AEM-130 will not make
its first flight until well into 1996, Russian sources said. No decision
will be made until after flight tests begin, but it could come relatively
early in the flight test phase, they said.
   Yakovlev will test a single aircraft, but MAPO-MiG officials believe a
plan to ``field-test'' several ATs in parallel with traditional flight
testing will work to their advantage in the Defense Ministry's decision.
Under the plan, MAPO-MiG would produce 15 ATs in 1996 and provide 5-7 of
them immediately to one of the four Russian air force flight training
schools.
   MiG engineers believe another factor in their favor is that the initial
flight test aircraft is composed of 25% ``serial'' components and structure
identical to and off the same tooling that would be used for production
aircraft. This 25% includes the horizontal stabilizer and the wing with its
integral fuel tanks.
   The second MiG-AT is in advanced fabrication and will have 50% of its
structure as serial components. The third aircraft will be the same as
production versions from a design and production tooling standpoint.
   These first three aircraft would all go into the AT flight test program
at Ramenskoye, while the fourth aircraft would be devoted to static loads
testing.
   If selected by the Russian government, MAPO-MiG would produce 35 ATs in
1997 and 50 in 1998. The company believes there is global market potential
for about 1,200 AT aircraft.
   While testing the new fighter and trainer, MAPO-MiG this year will also
increase testing of the MiG-29M--to be redesignated the MiG-33. The
evaluations will continue new air refueling system development begun in
late 1995 and tests of the aircraft using laser-guided bombs.
   Recent weapon tests with laser-guided bombs indicate that the
MiG-29M/MiG-33 radar has the capability to acquire a ground target at
ranges up to 50 km. (31 mi.), a distance greater than earlier tests
indicated. The aircraft can then use its own laser designator, or a laser
designation by ground forces, to guide the weapon once it is dropped.
   WHILE THE NEW PROGRAMS show that the Russian air force is trying to
maintain advanced developments, the air force budget will have to be
increased significantly if any of these aircraft are to be placed in
production.
   During all of 1995, for example, the air force ordered only 15 new
aircraft including helicopters. Of these, only two were fighters.
   Last year, MAPO-MiG built 35 of the standard MiG-29 version, and none
were delivered to the Russian air force. Seven of the aircraft were
delivered to Slovakia and 10 to Hungary in exchange for Russian debt
relief.
   The only funded MiG-29 deliveries were to Malaysia, which received 18 in
1995. An additional 18 MiG-29s are expected to be ordered by Malaysia under
a new procurement cycle that begins this year (AW&ST Dec. 18/25, 1995, p.
12).

FIRST FLIGHT OF C-130J DELAYED

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
   Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems has delayed first flight of the
C-130J by about a month to complete functional testing and debugging of the
new, software-laden transport's systems.
   Program managers had expected to have run C-130J No. 1's Allison
AE2100D3 engines, with their six-bladed Dowty Aerospace R391 propellers, by
mid-December. While the aircraft had been fueled, the engines had not been
run by Dec. 21.
   Low-speed taxi tests were delayed, as was the first flight, which
tentatively had been scheduled for about Dec. 27. That flight is now
targeted for the second half of this month.
   In addition to the enhanced performance that the Allison/Dowty
powerplant provides, the C-130J uses fully integrated digital avionics
built around 10 Mil-Std 1553B data buses and two mission computers.
   The aircraft also has a two-pilot flight deck with a front panel of four
large and five smaller liquid crystal displays and two Flight Dynamics
head-up primary flight instrument displays.
   Countering the testing setback was the Royal Australian Air Force's
order for 12 C-130Js, with options to buy more. The C-130Js are to replace
the RAAF's 12 C-130Es. Additional aircraft could be used for tanker and
airborne early warning missions and for the eventual replacement of the air
force's 12 C-130Hs.
   The $670-million contract calls for Lockheed to deliver the aircraft
over the next five years.
   ``This is an important signing for the C-130J,'' said Al Hansen,
executive vice president for Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems. ``Many
customers in the Asia-Pacific area use the Royal Australian Air Force as a
guide in ordering their own equipment.''
The Australian contract brings the number of C-130Js ordered this year to
39.
   The No. 1 test aircraft is the first of 25 stretched -30 versions of the
C-130J that Lockheed Martin is building for the United Kingdom's Royal Air
Force. The U.S. Air Force also has ordered two standard-length C-130Js.
   Aircraft No.1's first flight is to launch a test program of about 1,000
flight hours. The second and third aircraft are to join the flight test
program next month, with a fourth and fifth coming on line in March.

AGM-130 SEEKER TESTED

(BOSTON)
   The U.S. Air Force and Rockwell International have successfully tested a
new infrared seeker on the precision-guided, rocket-propelled AGM-130 that
can be launched at a target from more than 40 mi. away.
   AGM-130s with television seekers or an earlier-generation scanning
infrared seeker are now in the U.S. Air Force weapons inventory and could
be used in Bosnia if needed. The weapon was just entering service during
Desert Storm and was not used in that conflict. The AGM-130 has either a
2,000-lb. blast/fragmentation warhead or a similar weight penetrating bomb
with a forged steel case. It can be dropped from as low as 200 ft. to hit
targets 15 mi. away, or from altitudes of more than 30,000 ft. to hit
targets more than 40 mi. away.
   When it is dropped at 200 ft., the rocket motor boosts the weapon up to
a cruising altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 ft. After rocket burnout, the weapon
glides to its target. An aircraft might fly low to hide behind terrain or
fly high and stand off at a considerable distance from the target.
   After launch from an F-15E or an F-111, the bomb glides for a while and
then is boosted by a rocket motor. The motor drops off after it is expended
and the weapon continues to glide. An INS/GPS unit puts the weapon in the
correct position about 15 sec. before impact for a weapon system operator
in the fighter aircraft to guide it in manually using imagery from the
television or infrared seeker.
   The seeker tested late last year at Eglin AFB, Fla., is a staring focal
plane array made of mercury cadmium telluride with 256 X 256 elements. It
was produced by Rockwell's Autonetics & Missile Systems Div. The staring
focal plane array is interchangeable with the charged coupled device camera
used in the weapon. The new seeker has a cryogenic cooling subsystem.
   The test at Eglin involved an F-15E dropping a Rockwell AGM-130 while
flying at 480 KTAS at an altitude of 2,000 ft. The aircraft was 14.2 n.m.
from the target and the weapon made a direct hit. A Rockwell official said
the new infrared seeker has greatly improved sensitivity and performs
better in adverse weather conditions.

ALCATEL PICKS MATRA FOR WORLDSPACE SATELLITE

By:
CRAIG COVAULT

(PARIS)
Matra Marconi Space will build three new communications satellites for the
space segment of the $600-million WorldSpace/Alcatel digital radio
broadcast system to serve Africa, South America and Asia.
   The WorldSpace/ Alcatel system could revolutionize the way radio
broadcasting is conducted around the world.
   The WorldSpace system is specifically geared to bring digital radio
services, including programs by international broadcasters such as the
Voice of America, to 3.5 billion people living in developing nations.
   Alcatel Espace of Paris is the prime contractor for the WorldSpace
organization, based in Washington. Matra Marconi will be Alcatel's major
subcontractor in the project.
   IN ADDITION TO coordinating the space segment, Alcatel will build the
advanced broadcast system to be integrated with all three Matra satellites.
This system will include the On-Board Baseband Processor (OBP) on each
satellite that will continually switch among dozens of radio
uplink/downlink channels.
   WorldSpace secured up to $650 million in financing for the long-term
project and signed Alcatel to an overall contract worth $600 million.
   The initial down payment on that contract enabled Alcatel in late
December to select Matra Marconi for a contract worth $100-150 million to
develop the initial three satellites.
   Matra was selected over Aerospatiale, Alenia and Space Systems/Loral.
Alcatel had in fact negotiated complete (but unsigned) contracts with all
four competitors before selecting a final bidder, according to Francis
Fraikin, Alcatel's director of commercial telecommunications.
   The first spacecraft, designated AfriStar-1, is to be launched in
mid-1998, and placed in geosynchronous orbit over Africa at 21 deg. E.
Long. From that location, its three spot beams will cover all of Africa,
Turkey and the Middle East.
   Two additional spacecraft are to be launched by mid-1999. The second
satellite will be CaribStar-1, to be positioned over the Pacific off South
America at 95 deg. W. Long. Its spot beams will cover all of Mexico and
Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean.
   The third satellite, AsiaStar-1, will be positioned at 105 deg. W.
Long., where it could beam radio broadcasts into all of India, southern and
eastern China and the entire Pacific basin.
   Each of the 2.7-metric-ton advanced Eurostar-type spacecraft will have a
5.5-kw. power capability and a planned orbital lifetime of 15 years.
   Much of the area to be served by the WorldSpace system now relies on
antiquated shortwave broadcasts. The three satellites will enable both
locally based broadcasters, as well as major ``world service'' networks, to
beam high-quality signals to millions of square miles of rugged terrain
with minimal ground infrastructure.
   Each spacecraft will have 288 standard ``voice'' channels that can be
combined by the OBP system into 144 individual ``monoaural-music'' channels
or 72 high-quality channels that can provide music with compact disc (CD)
quality. Stations using the satellites will be able to mix and match
channel needs, depending upon their broadcast plans each day. The OBP
system will make the proper allocations on board the satellite.
   The three satellites combined will have 216 CD-quality channels.
WorldSpace will offer 126 of these for sale to international and national
broadcasters. The Voice of America and Holland's Radio Nederland have
already signed up for this service. The remaining 90 channels will be
reserved for ``pay-radio'' services. WorldSpace is also selecting companies
to build the system's small, low-cost radios.
   ALCATEL MANAGERS VIEW the program as vital to positioning the company as
a full satellite service provider in the 21st century, Fraikin said.
   Alcatel is also completing contract arrangements with GE Americom,
Princeton, N. J., for the separate $240-million ``Starsys'' program in
which Alcatel would provide the GE unit with up to 24 small satellites to
track vehicle fleets.
   A contract for the first six satellites and their launch costs would be
worth about $100 million, according to Norbert Lannelongue, Alcatel
director of Observation Sciences.
   The major new element for Alcatel is to jump from the role of providing
just a communications payload for a satellite to the new, higher level of
providing a complete telecommunications system that includes the
satellites, ground system and revenue generating services, Fraikin said.
   ``We are alone in Europe as a company that is both in the satellite
business and is also a telecommunications company,'' he said.

USAF STEPS UP PACE OF BOSNIA AIRLIFT

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
The U.S. Air Force intensified the pace of air operations into Bosnia and
Hungary over the Christmas holidays, taking advantage of good weather by
conducting 50-60 flights a day to four airfields in the theater.
   The weather cleared on Dec. 21 after several days of low clouds and fog,
and the Air Force was able to operate nearly 100 C-130 and C-17 missions
into Tuzla by Christmas day. As of Dec. 27, there had been a total of 164
missions flown to Tuzla carrying 1,235 tons of cargo. Other destinations
served include Sarajevo, Zagreb and Taszar in Hungary.
   C-141s began flying into Bosnia on Christmas eve, when the first
Starlifter touched down at Tuzla. This aircraft was operated by the 16th
Airlift Sqdn. at Charleston, S.C., the only -141 unit with a special
operations mission. The pilots are trained in low-level navigation and in
the use of night vision goggles but did not need these special procedures
at Tuzla. The airport is now equipped with TACAN and with precision
approach radar (PAR).
   The first C-17 to land at Tuzla arrived on Dec. 19 with a self-propelled
155-mm. howitzer, a support vehicle and trailer. Prior to Dec. 8, when a
C-17 landed at Sarajevo carrying humanitarian supplies, the aircraft had
not participated in any U.S. airlift operations into Bosnia. The C-17 can
carry four times the payload of the C-130.
   As of Dec. 26, the C-17 provided lift for more passengers and cargo in
support of Operation Joint Endeavor than C-5s or C-141s (see chart below).
C-130s from Air Combat Command logged 242 missions in support of the
operation and carried 1,269 passengers and 2,221 tons of cargo as of Dec.
28.
   Twelve C-17s have deployed from Charleston AFB, to Rhein Main AB in
Germany to support Bosnia operations. Tuzla can only accommodate one C-17
(or one C-141) in addition to 3 C-130s on the ground at the same time.
   Air Force Mission Planning System computers were airlifted by C-17s to
Europe. This system built by Sanders is being used to plan C-17 routes into
Bosnian airports and creating mission profiles.

F-16S UPGRADED FOR BOSNIA CAS ROLE

By:
JAMES T. McKENNA

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Services technicians have completed a
rush installation of upgraded modems in 38 Block 40 F-16s to improve the
aircraft's close-air support capabilities for NATO operations in Bosnia.
   Developed by the Naval Research Laboratory and produced by Symetrics
Industries Inc. here, the Improved Data Modems (IDMs) are designed to
increase the interoperability of units from the various U.S. military
services in combat. The high-speed, burst data modem shifts frequencies to
frustrate interception and jamming and is capable of translating
communications transmitted in various military protocols, such as the U.S.
Air Force's AFAPD, the Army's TACFIRE and the Navy/Marine Corps MTS.
   Each of the modem's two digital signal processors can handle two
channels, working with the aircraft's ARC 164 UHF HQII and ARC 186 radios.
When wired into the aircraft, the modem permits the pilot to receive voice
and data communications simultaneously on a single radio channel.
   The modem also includes a generic interface processor, a power converter
card and a KY58 encryption device.
   The modems already are in use supporting the
suppression-of-enemy-air-defenses capabilities of Block 50 F-16s.
   Lockheed Martin and Symetrics responded to an Air Force request to
quickly equip the Block 40 F-16s slated for close-air support (CAS)
missions in Bosnia. Symetrics' workers produced 41 IDMs in 30 days, and the
Lockheed Martin technicians installed the units in 36 aircraft at Aviano
AB, Italy, and two at Hill AFB.
   The effort, dubbed Project Sure Strike, is intended in part to
demonstrate the ability to meld the IDM's capabilities with those of the
CAS Integrated Targeting System. That system consists of a Mark 7 laser
targeting, the AN/PSN-11 precision lightweight GPS receiver, a Litton
Hand-held Terminal Unit and a Magnavox AN/PRC-113 VHF/UHF radio.
   The system is intended to allow ground troops to precisely guide the
Block 40 F-16 pilots to their CAS targets.
   The modems on the aircraft are designed to handle both digital and
analog data and voice traffic through the F-16's installed radios,
according to Jerry L. Sinclair, vice president of programs at Symetrics.
   THE CURRENT INSTALLATION on the Block 40 F-16s restricts communications
to TACFIRE communications, which is the protocol for the CAS Integrated
Targeting System. The aircraft operational flight programming must be
altered before takeoff if the mission calls for another protocol. The SEAD
Block 50 F-16s have the capability to switch protocols on the fly.
   The IDM passes signals from the ARC 164 or 186 radio over a Mil-Std 1553
bus to the aircraft's fire control unit and to the pilot's HUD, where the
signal generates a target-designator box. The pilot can store up to five
IDM targets and store or ignore IDM messages.

CROATS PONDER EARLY PUSH INTO EASTERN SLAVONIA

By:
DAVID A. FULGHUM

(WASHINGTON)
Croatian leaders are believed to be weighing their army's chances of
recapturing eastern Slavonia--possibly between mid-January and
mid-March--instead of waiting for up to two years for a Serb pullout
envisioned in the current regional peace plans.
   In order to derail an offensive, senior U.S. defense officials say NATO
forces will be very aggressive and intrusive in their aerial reconnaissance
of the region and will move quickly and with great force to derail any
preparations for renewed conflict. The contested portion of Croatia is
bordered by Hungary on the north, Serbia on the east and Croatia on the
south and west.
   ``We don't think the Croats have made the decision [to attack] yet, but
it is one of their serious planning options,'' a senior U.S. defense
official said.
   Croat leaders could be tempted to launch an offensive for a variety of
weather-related, military and political reasons, according to
Washington-based defense officials. Analyses show the initial key danger
period will run from the final pullout of United Nations' force in
mid-January until the region's spring thaw, probably in mid-March.
   KEY MANEUVER AREAS for tanks and other vehicles in the northern part of
Slavonia--the only remaining occupied area of Croatia, earlier known as
United Nations Sector East--are swamps that will only support motorized
traffic while frozen, U.S. officials point out. After the thaw, the Croats'
slashing style of attack--involving armored spearheads and fast-moving
columns of mobile troops--would be severely limited.
   Moreover, expected bad winter weather and heavy cloud cover during the
period could prevent Allied air attacks on the Croat attackers until after
Slavonia is reoccupied, a task that under ideal conditions could take only
a matter of hours, according to a senior U.S. military official.
   The Croatian government is under intense pressure from nationalist hawks
to retake the last part of Croatia still under Serb control. National
leaders believe NATO commanders may remain focused on Bosnia, allowing them
to prepare for an attack with some degree of freedom.
   ``The Belgian and Russian troops in the area now are clearly inadequate,
and in an offensive would do little more than provide targets,'' the
defense official said.
   Another temptation for the Croats is the relative slowness with which
NATO forces are moving into the region, establishing influence and
beginning to monitor military activities. By moving soon, the Croats might
face less NATO interference and fewer Allied troops.
   Finally, the Croatian military high command has contempt--which some
believe is misplaced--for the combat prowess of both the Bosnian Serb
military units and the Yugoslavian National Army (JNA).
   Senior Croat military leaders consider the JNA, in particular, to be
``clumsy , slow-moving and overly reliant on firepower and mass,'' the
senior U.S. military official said. ``The Croats point out very eagerly
that they would rely on tempo rather than mass. Their [doctrine is to]
reach deep and seize key points; isolate rather than overwhelm.''
   If the Croats retake eastern Slavonia, it will put them only the width
of the Danube River from Serbia which, so far, has stayed out of direct
participation in the Bosnian conflict. But a Croat attack to Serbia's
borders would be difficult for Serbia's leaders to swallow, and they might
retaliate.
   ``If the attack were just in Sector East [eastern Slavonia], the
Croatians can get to the Danube within hours, easily,'' the defense
official said. With heavy artillery, the Serbs could choose to saturate the
advancing Croats with long-range fire from across the river. ``They are
very good artillerymen,'' he said. To silence or inflict heavy damage on
the artillery, ``the Croats would have to go deep, use counter-battery fire
and use their air force,'' striking into Serbia proper.
   However, U.S. opinion is divided over what the JNA's response might be
and its potential effectiveness. The Krajina Serbs occupying Sector East
are seen as a great embarrassment to the Serbian national government. If
the Croats attacked quickly and were successful, there would likely be
little or no response from the JNA, a second senior U.S. defense official
said.
   ``If they get bogged down [in an extended fight], the Serbs might be
forced to weigh in,'' he said. ``The Croats really only have a small air
force'' consisting of a few dozen MiG-21 fighter bombers and Mi-24 attack
helicopters. ``If they tried striking across the Danube, the Serbian air
force could kick the hell out of them. It would be like poking at a
hornet's nest.''
   THIS SCENARIO COULD quickly undermine the fragile peace in the region.
So the question for the West becomes how to contain such aggressive moves
before they gather momentum. Western technology, much of it airborne, may
again provide the answer. The U.S., in particular, is moving its most
sophisticated intelligence gathering aircraft into the region. Moreover,
service planners are piecing together a sophisticated communications
network to collect, sort through and route this intelligence to key
decision makers that has no parallel, even in Desert Storm.
   Central to the U.S. effort will be its nationally controlled
surveillance satellite network and the decidedly more flexible U.S. Air
Force E-8 Joint-STARS, RC-135 Rivet Joint and EC-130 Airborne Command and
Control Centers and British Nimrod electronic warfare aircraft. Also
dedicated to the peacekeeping task will be the joint-service,
long-endurance Predator unmanned aerial vehicles that became operational in
1995.
   Some U.S. officials believe that, in particular, Joint-STARS'
intelligence collecting capability will ``be used as a confidence building
measure because it can look on both sides of the Danube River,'' the
intelligence official said, keeping track of military preparations by all
the factions--Croat, Bosnian and Serb. And the U.S. plans to use its
reconnaissance forces aggressively.
   ``We are going to enforce the peace our way,'' a U.S. military official
said. In order to prevent renewed hostilities, NATO forces will strike hard
and preemptively at anyone seen making preparations for war, he said.
   JOINT-STARS CAN accurately and continuously track ground vehicle and
low-flying helicopter traffic. Rivet Joint can plot the site and type of
electronic emissions and even monitor military voice and data
communications. Critical information, including the stated intentions of
suspected commanders and activities of small units, could be intercepted
and analyzed for NATO officials.
   The Predator UAV, which is scheduled to return to Bosnian operations at
the beginning of March, even has additional operational versatility. It can
fly directly over areas of interest, such as troop concentrations or
command sites, to observe at low altitude without risk to aircrews.
   Croatia formed the strike arm of its new air force around
Soviet-designed MiG-21 fighter bombers and Mi-24 attack helicopters from
the former East German air force. According to U.S. intelligence officials,
the Croatian government has even more money to spend on arms, unlike many
other Eastern European nations, and continues to survey the world market
for additional military equipment. U.S. officials decline to say how the
former East German equipment got to Croatia other than suggesting it was
``not a state to state'' transfer.

ROUGH BALKAN TERRAIN FORCES CHANGE IN JOINT-STARS' TACTICS

By:
DAVID A. FULGHUM

(WASHINGTON)
The U.S. E-8 Joint-STARS, NATO's major aerial platform for spying on
Bosnian military ground and helicopter traffic, will face much more
daunting terrain than it did in its 1991 operational debut in Operation
Desert Storm.
   Joint-STARS is expected to begin flying missions early this month to
provide NATO peacekeepers with improved situational awareness of Bosnian
government and Bosnian Serb movements. During Desert Storm, the long-range,
synthetic aperture radar-equipped aircraft were observing the virtually
featureless desert plains of Kuwait and Iraq, where even wind-blown barbed
wire could be seen by the aircraft's moving target indicator (MTI). From
the sky over Bosnia, U.S. military radar operators and analysts will have
to pick ground vehicles and low-flying helicopters out of topography
stitched with mountains and ravines that can often block the radar's view.
However, in compensation, the Bosnians will be restricted to a smaller
number of more predictable routes, generally following the valleys and
passes.
   TO MINIMIZE THE radar's difficulties in looking into narrow valleys or
the far side of mountains, mission planners have been plotting a variety of
flight tracks and orbits that will allow the two E-8s the most extended
looks at crucial road, rail and low-level flight routes, according to Air
Force and Northrop Grumman officials.
   The first task was to get the necessary permissions and clearances to
fly 60-120-n.m. tracks over Hungary, Croatia and the Adriatic Sea. With the
aircraft sensor's ability to look out to a range of 200 n.m., its crew can
keep the Joint-STARS well beyond range of Bosnian Serb SA-2 and SA-6
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Bosnian Serb threats to acquire the
long-range, more capable SA-10 SAMs have so far proven empty. Even so, no
proposed Joint-STARS patrol tracks will position aircraft over Serbia or
the Bosnian Serb Republic.
   Joint-STARS crewmen will rely on system-generated cues and predictive
algorithms that memorize the direction, speed and size of ground traffic
and alert operators if vehicles of interest do not move as expected or
predicted.
   ``If a [military] convoy disappears, it will alert you,'' a Northrop
Grumman official said of the Joint-STARS system. ``It has a memory; it
knows where to look'' for a string of vehicles, for example, to reappear
out of a valley or tunnel or from behind a mountain.
   The Joint-STARS' impressive computer memory also helps retain a radar
picture when the aircraft turns. The E-8 is limited to a 30-deg. bank, so
it takes about 2 min. to reverse its course in order to start a new leg of
a patrol. The aircraft is largely blind during much of the turn, so the
computer's memory is used to keep continuity in the ground picture.
Operators generally monitor a 60 X 60-n.m. target area at any moment.
   With only two available aircraft--a Desert Storm-veteran E-8A and the
first new E-8C--and three trained crews, the amount of time E-8s will be
available over Bosnia will be limited. Certainly, there will not be
around-the-clock coverage of Bosnia. It is likely the aircraft will be used
most extensively at night and in bad weather, two periods that treaty
violators would use to hide prohibited movements. The radar on the third
Joint-STARS aircraft, another A-model, has been removed. A fourth crew is
in training and might be available for Bosnian operations.
   The E-8C will have an almost all-military crew with only three or four
contractor personnel on board for maintenance chores. The older aircraft
still requires some contractor operators, an Air Force official said.
Ironically, the older aircraft actually have better imagery resolution than
the E-8C with its larger crew and more powerful computers. The E-8C is
awaiting an improvement to duplicate the older aircraft's image clarity.
About 25 contractor personnel have deployed to Rhein Main, Germany, with
the two aircraft.
   ONE HOT TOPIC OF debate in the surveillance community is how to best
find and track helicopter traffic. Helicopters have been used by all the
warring parties to violate United Nations no-fly zones, and NATO observers
are particularly eager to monitor and control such flights. Joint-STARS can
track helicopters, and the system will note and remember the distinctive
``pig-tail or death spiral'' pattern at the end of most helicopter flights.
As a result, Joint-STARS operators can plot sites regularly used by
helicopters for takeoffs and landings, such as headquarters, forward
refueling and rearming locations or other command and control sites, a
Northrop Grumman official said. A variety of such clues will be used to
analyze and predict helicopter and ground traffic.
   Joint-STARS also can receive the aerial picture from an E-3 AWACS, thus
allowing the E-8's operators to make a more comprehensive analysis of
Bosnian activities. AWACS does not have the capability of receiving the
Joint-STARS picture.

ELECTRONIC TAGS TO TRACK CARGO BOUND FOR BOSNIA

By:
DAVID HUGHES/BOSTON

   U.S. Transportation Dept. cargo tracking specialists are helping the
U.S. Army create a system for tagging nearly all military cargo headed for
Bosnia so it can be tracked electronically and monitored via satellite.
   Commercial electronic tags will be put on nearly all containers headed
into Bosnia. The tags, which will include cargo data, have small radio
transmitters with a limited range that can communicate with interrogation
units. These units will be placed at choke points on the land routes into
Bosnia and installed along with commercial-grade satellite communications
transmitters to beam data back to the U.S. via Inmarsat.
   Savi Technology, a company recently acquired by Texas Instruments, is
supplying some of the tags. Each one includes a miniature radio transceiver
and a microcomputer in a package about the size of a deck of playing
cards.
   WHEN TAGGED CARGO en route to Bosnia passes an interrogator, the
near-real-time data on cargo type and location will be received at a
command center in the Volpe Transportation System Center in Cambridge,
Mass., where the International Transportation Information Tracking
(Intransit) group works. This is the same group that tracked the shipment
of Patriot missiles to South Korea for the U.S. Army in 1994 (AW&ST May
16, 1994, p. 59).
   The Intransit specialists will also install a monitoring station for the
Army, probably at Huntsville, Ala. Smaller monitoring sites will also be
established in Germany, Hungary and Bosnia. Data will be sent first via
Inmarsat satellites to Cambridge, Mass., then relayed to the other sites.
   Intransit has assisted the United Nations in the past in monitoring the
enforcement of economic sanctions in the former Yugoslavia. For example,
oil barge traffic on the Danube River has been monitored by electronic
means.
   One of the main objectives of the Army is to make sure that a situation
does not develop like the one in Desert Storm in which thousands of
containers had to be opened after they arrived to see what was in them.
Electronic tags can be read by hand-held interrogators that will be
provided to soldiers. Commercially available tags are being used because
they are inexpensive enough to use in large quantities. The Army is also
using Qualcomm, a commercial cargo tracking system, to track some of the
cargo bound for Bosnia. Qualcomm uses Ku-band satellites.
   David Reed, chief of the Advanced Concepts Div. at the Volpe Center,
said commercially available electronic tags were used in Somalia with great
success. The Army already is using them at staging areas in the U.S. When
cargo arrives at Dover (Del.) AFB to be airlifted to Europe, it is
monitored by four interrogation units. Reed said palletized cargo bound for
Bosnia in military transports will be tagged, but may have to be retagged
at airports as it is repackaged for overland shipment.
   TRAINS LEAVING Germany for the former Yugoslavia may have satellite
communications equipment installed along with GPS receivers so their
positions can be monitored from the U.S. or Western Europe. As a train
passes an interrogator, it will be possible to check each tagged item.

ALASKAN AIR SAFETY OVERHAUL URGED

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS

(WASHINGTON)
Alaska's rough terrain, adverse weather and isolated, often crude airfields
pose serious aviation safety risks that can be minimized through a series
of fundamental improvements, according to a U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board report.
   The chief safety issues identified by the NTSB's extensive review of
Alaskan aviation included weather reports and observations, airport
conditions, flight and duty rest times, and heavy reliance on visual flight
rules (VFR) by most commuter, air taxi and general aviation pilots.
   OF THESE, TAKEOFF AND LANDING accidents and continued flight into
instrument meteorological conditions were cited by the NTSB as the leading
causes of crashes in the state, which has the largest number of airplanes
per capita in the nation. Aviation is Alaska's main mode of transportation
and is often the only lifeline available for many remote villages.
   Although takeoff and landing accidents occur frequently, they result in
fewer deaths than flying into hazardous weather, the report said.
   Because a majority of commuter and air taxi operators depends on VFR
conditions to conduct their flights, they are under pressure to reach their
destination and become vulnerable to the vagaries of deteriorating
weather.
   To improve flight safety in Alaska, the NTSB is urging the FAA to:
  -- Implement by Dec. 31, 1997, a demonstration program to create a
low-altitude, IFR route system in the Arctic and southeast regions of the
state that would more fully meet the needs of Alaska's air transportation
industry.
   Such a network would include use of the Global Positioning System as a
sole source of navigation for both en route and non-precision instrument
approaches. Many of Alaska's remote airfields lack any type of instrument
approach capability.
   The system also would use satellite-based voice communications as well
as Mode S transponders or VHF data link to provide air traffic controllers
with information on aircraft position and altitude. In addition,
uncontrolled airspace would be used during the program to accommodate IFR
departures, en route traffic and instrument approaches.
   In another key part of the program, NTSB officials are urging the FAA to
permit the use of turbine-powered, single-engine aircraft in commercial
operations under IFR, if they are equipped with redundant vacuum and
electrical subsystems. Current FAA rules prohibit use of single-engine
aircraft to carry passengers under VFR or IFR conditions.
   Although the agency already is studying the possibility of allowing
single-engine, turbine-powered aircraft to conduct such operations with
paying passengers on board, the NTSB also is recommending that the FAA
evaluate whether single-engine, piston-powered aircraft should be included.
The majority of small aircraft flying in Alaska are powered by
reciprocating engines, but a growing number of turboprop-powered aircraft
are entering commercial service.
  -- Determine the effect on safety of converting existing VFR operations
conducted under FAR Part 135 into IFR operations at remote or isolated
landing sites. The FAA would consider expanding weather reporting
facilities at such locations, install automated weather reporting systems,
or develop nonprecision instrument approaches at the sites and allow
operators to use them without the benefit of extensive weather data.
  -- Require Part 135 operators to provide initial and recurrent training
to pilots in aeronautical decision-making and judgment. The training would
be tailored specifically to that operator's environment. Commercial
operators also would be required to develop flight time duty limitations.
  -- Assist the National Weather Service in providing graphical weather
information to pilots that is specific to Alaska, and distribute that data
via the Rural Alaska Television network, Direct User Access Terminal
(DUAT), Alaska Public Television and the Internet.
  -- Ensure that staffing at Alaska's Automated Flight Service Stations
are adequate and that problems associated with poor radio communications
capability through remote outlets or navaids can be resolved.
  -- Modify the Notice to Airmen system to permit dissemination of
unverified information, labeled as such, about airport and remote field
conditions reported by official and unofficial aviation resources. The
report also suggests that a training program be established that would
permit ``microphone-in-hand'' reports on airport conditions by Alaska
airport maintenance personnel and contract workers.

TRAMCO HELPS AMERICA WEST

(LOS ANGELES)
America West Airlines has decided to have Tramco in Everett, Wash., perform
its heavy C and D-check maintenance, instead of continuing the work at the
carrier's Phoenix base.
   About 500 America West employees will lose their jobs as a result. The
company expects to save $35 million over the five-year Tramco contract,
including a $10.5-million one-time charge for the shift. The airline said
about 470 employees will be retained for line maintenance at Phoenix. The
maintenance employees are nonunion.
   ``Maintaining our low-cost advantage relative to our competitors is
imperative to America West's financial security now and in the future,''
said W. Douglas Parker, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Several of its competitors, including Southwest Airlines, already outsource
all or part of their heavy maintenance.
   Tramco has been performing modifications and other maintenance for
America West over the last two years.
   Laid-off employees will receive about 35% of annual salary, and those
with six years tenure will receive 56%. The airline expects to add 800-900
jobs to the Phoenix area as part of its two-year growth plan (AW&ST Nov.
13, 1995, p. 28).

TWA BEGINS RECOVERY, BUT REMAINS UNPROVEN

By:
ANTHONY L. VELOCCI, JR.

(NEW YORK)
Trans World Airlines Inc., while still no picture of health, appears to be
on the path to a recovery scarcely imagined a year ago.
Here's why:
  -- Entering the industry's traditional January-March slow period, TWA has
a cash cushion of more than $300 million. That is nearly triple the amount
the company had in reserve in January.
  -- TWA is one of only two full-service carriers in the U.S. that reduced
its cost per available seat mile significantly in 1995, according to
industry analysts; Delta Air Lines is the other. Excluding subsidiary
operations, TWA's cost per ASM at the end of the third quarter was 7.8
cents, down from 8.3 in December, 1994.
  -- Operating cash flow--the lifeblood of a business--has increased
substantially and is more than sufficient to cover the airline's debt
obligations. In fact, the ratio of cash flow to interest and principal
coverage currently stands at its highest level in years. Prior to this
year, TWA was scraping by.
   ``The company's image has been tarnished for so long, I'm getting real
enjoyment out of surprising all of the skeptics who thought we couldn't
possibly survive, much less make money,'' Chief Financial Officer Robert
Peiser said.
   At the start of 1995, the airline projected a net loss of $237 million
for the full year. Actual losses for the first nine months were about $200
million, which means the airline is approximately on target with its
business plan. For 1996, the airline expects to generate operating and net
income of $251 million and $95 million, respectively.
   TWA has started to convert some skeptics into cautious optimists. ``It's
remarkable what the airline has accomplished,'' Furman Selz analyst Raymond
Neidl said.
  According to Michael K. Lowry's assessment, TWA ``has turned the
corner.'' ``Its financial condition is substantially better, liquidity is
improving, and passenger demand for TWA's product is firm,'' said the
president of Aviation Forecasting & Economics Inc., in Lake Oswego, Ore.
   While all of that may be true, there remain those who continue to look
upon TWA as still a largely unproven entity.
   ``A rising tide lifts all ships, and a good deal of improvement at TWA
is attributable to the favorable operating conditions, as well as the
demise of Continental Airlines' CalLite,'' Rene Shaker, an analyst at
Moody's Investors Service, said. ``TWA still has significant challenges
ahead.''
   One of those is Southwest Airlines' encroachment into St. Louis, TWA's
largest and most important domestic hub, she said. Another challenge is
strengthening the airline's international operations. Load factors are
about 12% higher than last year, but that part of TWA's business is widely
perceived as hobbled because it includes no route authority to London's
Heathrow Airport.
   ``It's not that TWA can't make money from the international routes it
has in place now,'' First Boston analyst Paul Karos said. ``It's just that
non-Heathrow routes tend to be lower-margin business, on average.''
   THERE ALSO IS A LACK of understanding on just what it is that TWA hopes
to become. ``Management needs to do a better job of defining the role they
envision for the airline long-term,'' Shaker said. ``Fighting a battle for
survival, which it seems to have won, and fighting for competitive position
are quite different,'' Shaker said.
   Perhaps TWA's most pressing chore is increasing revenues. ''For now, the
carrier probably has done as much as it can to clean up its balance sheet
and reduce debt service,'' Neidl said.
   TWA management has put revenue enhancement at the top of its priority
list and taken the action necessary to position the airline for substantial
top-line growth, starting in1996. A new computerized yield-management
system is expected to optimize the allocation of full-fare and discounted
seats on all of TWA's daily flights. TWA is the last major U.S. carrier to
adopt such a system, which is considered essential in today's competitive
environment.
   TWA's 1994 revenues were about $3 billion. Neidl believes the carrier's
yield-management system could increase that by about 3% or $100 million
annually--an estimate that Peiser said is reasonable.
   The airline also is trying to address the seasonal swings in its
revenues. TWA hopes to form a number of code-sharing alliances with other
carriers in the U.S. and in other countries. ``We have a good shot at
seeing a number of them materialize in the near future,'' Peiser said.
   Additionally, TWA has signed an agreements with a major tour operator,
who has guaranteed to fill a large number of seats on flights bound for
warmer climate destinations. This will complement the carrier's efforts to
fortify its presence in the Caribbean, Mexico and other parts of Central
America, as well as seasonal increase in service to Florida.
  THE PROBLEM IS THAT TWA is somewhat restricted in how fast it can move
into or expand in markets where its greatest revenue opportunities may
exist. The carrier simply does not have enough aircraft. Management is in
the market for replacement aircraft and hopes to make an announcement soon
concerning its fleet plan.

MD-83 TREE STRIKE SPARKS NTSB PROBE

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating an incident in
which an American Airlines MD-83 made an emergency landing after striking
the tops of trees on a ridge as it was making a non-precision approach to
Bradley International Airport.
   Only one person was slightly injured during the evacuation following an
emergency landing, but the aircraft incurred damage to its wings and
landing gear. The aircraft carried a crew of five and 72 passengers as it
landed shortly before 1 a.m. at Bradley at Windsor Locks, Conn., on Nov.
12.
   The mishap has drawn a high level of interest at the NTSB, which has
started looking at major incidents as closely as accidents in recent years.
A full report on the incident should be completed by late spring or early
summer. An NTSB investigator said ``a lot happened'' during the 70 sec.
from the time the plane struck the trees until it came to a stop on the
runway. The NTSB is still piecing together the course of events. There were
reports of gusty winds and turbulence in the area at the time of the
incident, but the NTSB is still evaluating data to see if wind shear was a
factor.
   The week after the incident American told its pilots to add 100 ft. to
the minimum descent altitude (MDA) on all non-precision approaches and to
add .5 mi. to the visibility minimums. An American official said this
temporary change applies to its operations worldwide while the company
evaluates all of the non-precision approaches in its route system.
   The VOR approach to Runway 15 at Bradley calls for aircraft to pass a
final approach fix at 4.8 mi. from the runway (5 mi. DME from the Bradley
VOR on the airfield) and descend from 2,000 ft. to the MDA of 1,080 ft.
There is a ridge between the final approach fix and the runway that has an
elevation of about 770 ft. with a stand of trees on it about 50 ft. tall.
The MDA is calculated by adding 250 ft. to the 820 ft. obstacle elevation
and then rounded up to a 20-ft. interval, to arrive at 1,080 ft.
   The aircraft had descended from the final approach fix and flown almost
half- way to the runway when the pilots received a ground proximity warning
system ``sink rate'' alert just prior to striking the trees. The pilots
were unable to avert impact with the trees, but as the aircraft skimmed the
tree tops they were able to advance the power and initiate a go-around to
avoid crashing in the wooded area. An on-board wind shear alert sounded
after the aircraft hit the trees and the NTSB is studying this.
   THE PILOTS DID NOT REALIZE they had struck the trees even though they
heard a loud noise, or that the encounter with the trees had dented and
torn holes in the flaps and slats. Both wing tips had been hit, composite
material had been shattered and the navigation lights were broken. Brush
and tree limbs were found in the wheel well and a landing gear door had
been torn off. The horizontal stabilizer had incurred some damage, perhaps
from flying wood debris, but the plane was still flying.
   The pilots began to retract the gear and flaps but then elected to land
instead when they spotted the runway lights. The Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219
engines were not producing full power and NTSB investigators found evidence
that the right engine caught fire at some point after impact with the
trees. It has not been determined whether the right engine failed.
   When the pilots saw the runway, they selected gear down and flaps 40
deg. The gear and flaps worked, even though some of the hydraulic lines
running through the wheel well had been broken. The aircraft was equipped
with a 60-channel flight data recorder, which is providing good data.
   THE AIRCRAFT STILL HAD difficulty making the runway. Workmen had removed
some trees from the approach end of Runway 15 the week before the incident.
Those trees could have posed an additional hazard on this emergency
approach. The MD-83 wiped out a whole row of T-shaped ILS antennas as it
approached the threshold and then touched down short of the runway in the
overrun area and bounced once before rolling 4,000 ft. to a full stop. The
brakes were still functioning. The crew and passengers then evacuated the
plane.
   The NTSB is trying to determine why the aircraft was about 260 ft. low
when it struck the stand of trees on a ridge and cut a path about 250 ft.
long and 100 ft. wide. The aircraft broke off mostly 2-in.-dia. branches up
to 15 ft. below the top of the trees before climbing away from the
obstruction. Some larger branches also were broken off.
   Investigators are examining what procedures the pilots used in setting
altimeters and maintaining MDA, what role turbulence may have played and
whether the height of the ridge line was correctly surveyed. Another
question is whether the crew stopped the descent before striking the
trees.
   The National Weather Service at the airport was reporting winds of 170
deg. at 25 kt. gusting to 40 kt. about 5 min. before the MD-83 landed. An
LLWAS alert did sound in another quadrant of the airport about 2 min. prior
to the tree strike incident.
   THE WEATHER OBSERVATION at Bradley 5 min. before the plane landed also
noted cloud cover of 1,700 ft. scattered and 2,800 ft. overcast with
barometric pressure falling rapidly. The visibility of 3 mi. in moderate
rain was sufficient to fly the VOR Runway 15 approach. The tower was closed
because a window had been blown loose. A air traffic controller who was
assisting repairmen responded to a radio call from the American Airlines
flight prior to the incident and advised the crew of the winds and the
LLWAS alert, and that the runway was clear.
   The NTSB is looking at the weather information provided to the crew and
how up-to-date it was as well as the altimeter data received from Boston
Center and ACARS. A special American Airlines procedure for having pilots
set their altimeters so they read zero on the runway has been examined by
the NTSB but is not an area of interest in the investigation. All three
altimeters on the MD-83 have been tested and found to be working properly.
   An international aviation industry group led by the Flight Safety
Foundation, with ICAO involvement, has been trying to have the way
non-precision approaches are designed changed to avoid the potential for
controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT). The CFIT task force would also like
aircraft to descend gradually on these approaches as if they were on an ILS
glidepath.
   American completed temporary repairs and flew the aircraft to its
maintenance base in Tulsa, Okla. The engines have been torn down; there
was heavy damage to the right engine and the rotating parts in the left
engine were out of alignment.

CRASH TRIGGERS REVIEW OF AMR
FAA launches inquiry as NTSB weighs review of training at American, Eagle
carriers

By:
JAMES T. McKENNA

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
U.S. officials are weighing an inquest into pilot training at American
Airlines and its regional affiliates in the wake of a 757 crash that
appears to have been caused in part by poor cockpit discipline.
   Senior National Transportation Safety Board officials believe the Dec.
20 crash of American Flight 965 into a mountain near Cali, Colombia,
warrants a probe of training at American's Flight Academy. American and its
four American Eagle affiliates train pilots there.
   The FAA has begun a review of American's operating procedures and
training with the airline and its pilots union, the Allied Pilots Assn.
   The Boeing 757-223's flight data and cockpit voice recorders were flown
at the Colombian government's request to the NTSB's laboratory in
Washington. U.S. and Colombian investigators there reviewed 30 min. of data
from the digital Sundstrand Data Control 980-4100 FDR and transcribed 30
min. 36 sec. of data from the Fairchild A-100 CVR.
   According to Capt. German Duarte, a Colombian investigator, the recorder
data sets contained no indications that the pilots of Flight 965 performed
their descent checklist or an arrival/approach procedures briefing.
   The pilots may have been confused about navigation aids used during
their approach to Runway 19 at Cali's Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International
Airport, he said, adding that they may have botched an ``escape maneuver''
as their aircraft neared the San Jose mountain.
   The NTSB and FAA are only assisting in the Flight 965 investigation,
which is being run by Colombia's civil aviation authority. Their focus on
training at American and the American Eagle carriers stems from the fact
that the crash just south of Buga, Colombia, is the latest in a string of
American-affiliated accidents.
   THE BUGA CRASH, IN WHICH 163 persons on board were killed, was only the
second fatal accident involving an American Airlines aircraft in 16 years.
But it was the fourth accident in 14 months and the second in just 39 days
involving American or American Eagle crews.
   ``It appears that [the Colombian] accident was entirely within the
cockpit,'' one U.S. official involved with the investigation told AVIATION
WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY. Added to the string of other accidents, ``that's a
highly unusual rate of training-related events.''
   The NTSB already has launched a major investigation of an American
flight that ripped 100 ft. through treetops before landing at Bradley
International Airport in Connecticut (see p. 44).
   Flight 965 departed Miami with 167 persons on board, including six
Bogota-based cabin crewmembers, Capt. Nicholas Tafuri and First Officer Don
Williams. Air traffic controllers at Cali lost radio contact with the
aircraft at 9:38 p.m. Duarte gave the following description of events:
   Tafuri, working the radios, contacted approach control as Flight 965
descended through 20,000 ft. about 63 mi. north of Cali. The controller
said the flight was ``cleared direct to Cali VOR, descend and maintain
one-five thousand.''
   Tafuri, who had more than 10,000 hr. of flying time and more than 2,000
hr. in the 757, acknowledged the clearance.
   Two minutes later, the controller radioed that winds at the airport were
calm and asked whether Flight 965 could approach Runway 19.
   ``Yes, sir,'' Tafuri said. ``We'll need a lower altitude right away,
though.''
   The controller then cleared the flight ``to the VOR DME approach runway
one-niner, ROZO number one arrival. Report Tulua VOR.''
   ``We'll report the VOR, thank you, sir.''
   Cali approach reiterated, ``Report Tulua,'' which the crew
acknowledged.
   The pilots then consulted their approach plate publications and
discussed the navaids to be used in the ROZO 1 arrival and their position
relative to Tulua VOR. They then asked if they could fly direct to the ROZO
nondirectional radio beacon north of the airport and execute the arrival
procedure.
   ``Affirmative, direct ROZO one and then runway one-niner, the winds
calm,'' the approach controller responded.
   After the crew acknowledged that, the controller said, ``Affirmative,
report Tulua and twenty-one miles, five thousand feet.'' The crew agreed.
   Duarte said the FDR indicates that at a point south of the Tulua VOR,
the pilots selected that VOR, code ULQ, in the flight management system.
The aircraft then turned left for about 90 sec., to an easterly heading.
   As the descent continued, the autopilot was switched to the heading
select mode and the aircraft entered a right turn to the southwest.
   The 757's ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) issued a ``Terrain''
mode warning, and called out ``Pull Up!'' repeatedly for 9 sec., until the
CVR tape ended. FDR data indicated that the pilots initiated a GPWS escape
maneuver, increasing engine power and pitching the nose up, 2 sec. after
the first aural warning. The stickshaker activated during this maneuver.
   FDR data also indicate that the flight spoilers, which had been deployed
during the descent, remained extended until impact, Duarte said. The
aircraft hit near the top of the 12,000-ft. mountain 12 mi. east of its
desired approach path and 38 mi. north of Cali.

747 SKID PROBED

(NEW YORK)
The NTSB is investigating why a Miami-bound Tower Air 747 departing New
York's JFK International Airport skidded off Runway 4L at 11:36 a.m. Dec.
20, the second day of a heavy East Coast winter storm.
   At the time of takeoff into falling snow, JFK ATIS was reporting winds
from 330 deg. at 11 kt. and a 2,000-ft. RVR. According to NTSB preliminary
accident data, the pilot of Flight No. 41 reported control difficulty
during the takeoff roll, then aborted takeoff on the 11,352-ft. runway at
an airspeed ``under 80 kt.'' Markings indicate the aircraft initially
departed the runway to the left, 1,200 ft. from the start of the roll. The
747 continued to veer left, then fully departed Runway 4L 2,100 ft. from
the beginning of the roll. The aircraft, with about 102,000 lb. of fuel on
board, hit an electrical conduit structure, which tore off the No. 4
JT9D-7A engine.
   The aircraft came to rest 4,800 ft. from the start of the roll, 800 ft.
to the left of runway centerline in a nose-down position, its nosegear and
right main gear collapsed. Portions of struts had pushed through the
forward cabin, lifting seats 2-3 ft.
   There were no fatalities, and about 35 minor injuries were reported
among the 445 passengers and 15 crew, all of whom were evacuated safely.
   The 747 had been deiced twice prior to departure, and the NTSB said the
aircraft was ``well within'' departure safety limits following its second
deicing. Tower Air Chairman and CEO Morris Nachtomi said on the day of the
accident ice and snow accumulation on the runway had caused the aircraft to
skid.
   The NTSB said it is encountering difficulty reading FDR data due to
software problems. But the safety board expects this to be resolved and
results of the investigation released within 3-4 months.

BOEING TO EXPAND 737 `ROLLS' PROGRAM

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS

(WASHINGTON)
Boeing's special ``rolls team'' is completing its probe into uncommanded
rolls involving 737-series aircraft as company engineers analyze new wake
turbulence data pertinent to the crash of a USAir 737-300 in September,
1994.
   Between April and August, 1995, Boeing received reports of 20 incidents
from U.S. airlines involving unexpected rolls in the 737. Most of the
incidents could not be explained by equipment faults or failures associated
with autopilot or yaw damper systems, Jean A. McGrew, 737 chief project
engineer, said.
   To address those incidents, Boeing formed the team in August to
determine why the rolls were occurring. Initial analysis indicated the
events ``were clearly different'' than typical anomalies, he said. Using
information from each aircraft's flight data recorder (FDR), the team
reviewed the events and conducted an analysis of the 737's lateral control
systems in an attempt to find a cause. By comparing FDR traces, a pattern
gradually emerged, McGrew said.
   In each case, during the initial upset 50% of the traces showed similar
characteristics, such as small increases in airspeed accompanied by rapid
roll rates and significant changes in vertical load factor, particularly
near peak roll angle. Mechanical failures typically do not produce such
changes in load factor, according to McGrew.
   Roll rates, for example, initially were slow but increased to values
well above the 6-7 deg./sec. normally induced by a system fault such as an
autopilot hardover. In addition, not all of the aircraft rolled in the same
direction, he said.
   When the traces were compared with those of five 737s known to have
encountered wake turbulence, the similarities were ``remarkable,'' McGrew
said. The team determined that at least seven upsets probably were caused
by wake turbulence, five were caused by equipment failures, and another
three involved some degree of interaction by the flight crew.
   As a result of the team's work with FDR traces, Boeing essentially has
developed a process to discern between an in-service roll event caused by a
failure and one caused by wake turbulence. McGrew expects Boeing will
expand the program this year to include other U.S. airlines and foreign
carriers operating the 737.
   Exactly what role wake vortices played in the loss of control of USAir
Flight 427 remains largely unknown. Boeing engineers expect analysis of new
data on vortex encounters will help them better understand the positions of
primary flight controls after the initial upset occurred.
   The USAir 737 was flying at 6,000 ft. about 4.5 n.m. behind a Delta Air
Lines 727-200 when it apparently encountered wake turbulence from the lead
aircraft during initial approach to Pittsburgh. The ensuing loss of control
led to a crash that killed all 132 people on board.
   U.S. National Transportation Safety Board officials are particularly
interested in movement of the aircraft's rudder. Accident analysis
indicates the rudder was deflected up to 21 deg. during the upset event and
remained displaced until impact with the ground. After 15 months of
intensive investigation, neither the NTSB nor Boeing has been able to
determine what could have caused the rudder to move.
   Boeing engineers are still extracting data from wake vortex research
flights conducted last September (AW&ST Oct. 2, 1995, p. 33).
   The chief purpose of the flights was to define more precisely the
location of the 727's vortices in relation to the accident aircraft.
   Engineers can then calculate aerodynamic coefficients of the airplane
within the vortex flow field to help verify accuracy of a distributed lift
model for the 737-300 developed by Boeing, James W. Kerrigan said. He is
lead aerodynamics engineer, 737-series stability and control, for Boeing
Commercial Airplane Co.
   Prior to the flights in September, engineers lacked data from airborne
wake encounters to support results generated by the model.

PRODUCTION EXPANSION HERALDS MARKET UPTURN

(SEATTLE)
Boeing will increase production by four transports a month to 24 by early
1997 to accommodate increased sales and help recover from a 10-week
machinists' strike. This will be the first production rate increase for
Boeing in three years.
   The shift signals the long-awaited upswing of the international
commercial transport market. Boeing's deliveries during the strike fell
behind by about 30 aircraft.
   The production spool-up affects almost all Boeing transport lines. Build
rate for the 737 narrow-body will increase to 8.5 a month from seven per
month by the fourth quarter of 1996. This reverses a previous plan to drop
production to five airplanes a month by April. The manufacturing rate of
Boeing's flagship 747 also will increase to 3.5 monthly from two by
year-end.
   Construction of wide-body 767s will increase from 3.5 to four a month
during 1996. The new Boeing 777, now being built at a rate of 3.5/month,
will increase to five a month in early 1997.
   ALTHOUGH THE MANUFACTURING rate of the 757 still will decline in 1996
from four to three transports a month, the move to the lower rate has been
postponed from June to September.
   Major orders for Boeing wide-body aircraft by Saudi Arabian Airlines and
Singapore Airlines helped drive the production expansion. Boeing also has
been successful at selling its new ``next-generation'' line of 737s. This
includes a year-end deal with China Airlines for six 737-800s and nine
options potentially worth $750 million.
   During 1995, the Seattle-based manufacturer announced new orders for 261
transports valued at $19 billion. This more than doubled the previous
year's total of 120 new orders worth $7.76 billion.
   The 777 has been a strong performer for Boeing, garnering about 230
orders and commitments. Since its October, 1990, launch, the 777 has won an
80% market share, according to top Boeing managers. The modernized 737-600/
700/800 series has logged almost as many sales, for 220 units, in the
little over two years it has been available.

JAS GETS MD-90

(LOS ANGELES)
McDonnell Douglas has delivered an MD-90 to Japan Air System--the first
receipt of the new derivative by a customer outside the U.S. JAS plans to
use the aircraft, and nine other MD-90s it has on order, in domestic
service, which is scheduled to begin in April. The JAS MD-90s, configured
in an all-economy arrangement with 166 seats, feature a passenger
entertainment and information system that includes 7-in. Matsushita liquid
crystal display color monitors. The system displays airspeed, distance to
destination, outside temperature and distance traveled.

PRIVACY ISSUES FRAME PILOT RECORDS DEBATE

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS

(WASHINGTON)
Airline industry officials are urging Congress to be cautious about
legislation regarding accessibility of pilot employment records because of
serious privacy and legal issues.
   During testimony before the House aviation subcommittee in December, a
number of senior airline and air taxi industry representatives told
lawmakers they generally favor at least limited access to a pilot's
personnel records as part of a pre-employment program.
   OFFICIALS WITHIN the airline industry support access to personnel
records by prospective employers, but are concerned about ``thorny privacy,
defamation, negligence and contract interference issues'' that must be
``thoroughly explored and resolved'' to protect both the airlines and
pilots, Edward Merlis, senior vice president of the Air Transport Assn.,
said. The ATA represents most major U.S. airlines including cargo
carriers.
   ``It's a subject which must be addressed,'' Randolph Babbitt, president
of the Air Line Pilots Assn., said. ALPA represents more than 44,000 pilots
at 37 airlines. Babbitt considers recommendations made by the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board as ``too narrow'' in scope.
   Safety board officials made the recommendations after its investigation
into the crash of an American Eagle regional transport in December, 1994.
The captain's previous employer was not required to transfer his records to
the American Eagle carrier. Those records revealed previous deficiencies in
the pilot's flying performance that were unknown by American Eagle.
   The NTSB wants standardized information about pilot qualifications to be
maintained and shared among airlines as well as independent training
agencies such as FlightSafety International. An airline's hiring and
training practices currently are not required to meet any standard
specifications except those mandated by the Federal Aviation Regulations.
As a result, hiring practices are ``extremely diverse,'' Babbitt said.
   To strengthen control of pilot records, ALPA is calling for a program
similar to one proposed in 1992 by a Transportation Dept. study that
suggested more stringent hiring and training procedures as well as
formulation of performance-based standards for entry-level pilots. Tougher
pre-employment screening, standardized training and monitoring programs
would help maintain ``the high quality of airline pilots, both now and in
the future,'' Babbitt said.
   HE WANTS THE NTSB to conduct a special study of hiring and training
rules within the U.S. airline industry, followed by an FAA/industry
coalition charged with implementing new changes.
   The National Air Transportation Assn. (NATA) supports a bill introduced
last month by Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.) that would provide some degree of
liability protection for airlines releasing pilot records. The bill
essentially would permit the transfer of a pilot's existing records to
another airline if the pilot had applied for a job with the second
carrier.

IATA'S AVIATION ENGLISH COURSE COMES TO CHINA

(HONG KONG)
China's aviation establishment has asked the International Air Transport
Assn. to conduct a major aviation English language skills course as part of
the country's drive to meet world air safety standards.
   Training would be given to some 2,000 pilots and as yet an undetermined
number of air traffic controllers. It would be modeled after a similar
program that IATA set up three years ago in Prague for Eastern European
airlines. Training will be in language skills only; IATA is not teaching
piloting or ATC skills.
   THE REQUEST COMES FROM the Civil Aviation Administration of China with
Air China's pilots in mind as the first students. A lack of English skills
is regarded as one of China's most persistent problems (AW&ST Oct. 2, 1995,
p. 50).
   Director General Pierre Jeanniot said IATA and the CAAC also will
establish a joint-venture data processing center to bring China's billing
and settlement services up to international standards. The Chinese had
initially undertaken the task on their own, but realized they were
reinventing the wheel and will now turn to proven IATA software to make the
task easier.
   IATA will provide its first training for the Chinese aviation sector to
a group of 250 travel agents, who will learn accounting procedures for
interlining of tickets as well as other tasks. Jeanniot said there was a
potential need for 10,000 Chinese travel agents to be trained.
   The three Chinese IATA members--Air China, China Southern and China
Eastern--will send managers to Geneva for courses in various business
tasks, such as yield management and weight balancing.
   Jeanniot, who recently visited Beijing to discuss cooperation with the
CAAC, said IATA will begin translating its technical documents into
Chinese. The first will be IATA's Dangerous Goods Manual.
   Late last year, IATA began reviewing China Northern's application to
become its fourth Chinese member airline. A fifth member--probably China
Southwest--could be admitted during the next year.
   Jeanniot criticized the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for its tight
grip on civil aviation operations. He particularly targeted the PLA's
control of the nation's airspace and sale of aviation fuel, which is twice
as high as world averages.
   ``There is a need for a political decision'' at a high level to reduce
the role of the military in civil aviation policy, he said.
   Jeanniot praised China's efforts to improve air safety. But he noted
that in many areas the effort is uncoordinated. For instance, airlines are
not permitted to discuss airport expansion programs with planners.
   ``A customer-driven industry concept doesn't exist'' in China, he
commented.

DELTA, LOCKHEED MARTIN PURSUE JOINT L-1011 WORK

By:
JAMES T. McKENNA

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
Delta Air Lines and Lockheed Martin are teaming to close what they say is a
gap in maintenance services for L-1011 aircraft in North America.
   The airline, which is among the world's largest L-1011 operators, has
signed an agreement to join with Lockheed Martin to provide comprehensive
maintenance, engineering and parts support for more than 200 L-1011s in
service in the world today. Lockheed built the aircraft in the 1970s.
   The partnership, the terms of which will be defined over the next
several months, should allow Delta to boost its financial performance. The
carrier would gain additional revenue from contracts to service L-1011s for
other carriers. It also would be able to spread the cost of performing
damage-tolerance assessments of airframe repairs to its fleet of 56 L-1011s
over a larger base that included other carriers' aircraft.
   Lockheed Martin, in turn, would be able to add Delta's shop, engineering
and spares capabilities to the global L-1011 support structure. It also
would be able to market its overhaul and maintenance centers as a
``one-stop shop'' for L-1011 services.
   AN ALLIANCE OF DELTA and Lockheed Martin ``would fill a major void in
North America for L-1011 maintenance and support services,'' Dan Patterson,
president of Lockheed Martin Aircraft Center in Greenville, N.C., said.
Patterson recently took over at the former Lockheed Aeromod Center after
three years of running NASA's space shuttle launch operations as head of
Lockheed Space Operations Co.
   Lockheed Martin officials had been concerned that their limited aircraft
support structure would be strained by the migration of L-1011s from major
operators in North America and Asia to smaller operators in Asia, Africa
and Latin America.
   Trans World Airlines and Cathay Pacific, both carriers with extensive
engineering and maintenance capabilities, have begun selling off their
L-1011s. The smaller airlines likely to buy such aircraft may not have
substantial engineering and maintenance operations or the interest and
money to develop such operations. They would require a greater level of
engineering, maintenance and spares-production services than the current
L-1011 operators.
   That demand would tax the existing L-1011 support structure. The
perception that that structure is overburdened might cause used-aircraft
customers to favor McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, which enjoy a wider and more
robust support structure.
   The result would be a rising number of parked L-1011s and declining
support-service revenue for the company.
   In their search for more support business, Lockheed Martin
representatives decided to check on Delta's interest in farming out L-1011
maintenance to the center in Greenville.
   Contrary to ``outsourcing'' that work, ``Delta was interested in
'in-sourcing,' bringing more third-party L-1011 work in house,'' Robert
Stephenson said. The director of strategic and technical development at the
Greenville center, Stephenson participated in those initial talks.
   When the talks concluded, he said, both the Delta and Lockheed Martin
officials realized that the answer was for the companies to join in
pursuing L-1011 maintenance work.
   ``An alliance takes advantage of each other's inherent strengths,'' Ray
Valeika, Delta's vice president of technical operations, said. ``Together,
we have all the technical skill to keep those airplanes flying. It's a
niche for us that no one else can move into.''
   Valeika and Stephenson are used to working with each other, having
served together as engineers for Pan American World Airways for a number of
years.
   As envisioned now, Lockheed Martin would concentrate on L-1011 airframe
maintenance and modifications, including freighter conversions. The
company's Aircraft Service Co. in Ontario, Calif., which hold a
supplemental type certificate for an L-1011 freighter conversion, would
receive additional work under the alliance. But most of the work would go
to Greenville.
   Delta would overhaul and maintain alliance customers' Rolls-Royce RB211
engines, as well as aircraft component refurbishment and shop support.
   Greenville already handles some L-1011 airframe work, ``but the
customers are pretty much on their own for the engine and component work
right now,'' Stephenson said. The advantage of working with Delta is that
work could be trucked from Greenville to Atlanta in 2.5 hr. and be done
under one contract, he said.
   Delta will continue to do all its L-1011 airframe and powerplant
maintenance work in house, Valeika said, and may expand the wing
modification work it does now to include alliance customers' aircraft.
   The partners envision a range of services for customers, from a one-time
overhaul to complete turn-key maintenance services for an airline.
Stephenson said they are already at work contacting potential customers.

supporting its L-1011s over a larger base and generate more revenue from
its maintenance unit.

THAAD TEST FAILURE LINKED TO SOFTWARE ERROR

U.S. Army and Lockheed Martin engineers suspect a computer software error
caused the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) missile to stray off
course initially and miss a Storm target during an attempted intercept on
Dec. 13.
   Analysis of the failed test at White Sands (N.M.) Missile Range
indicates the missile strayed from its expected course due to the error.
After this, the Thaad kill vehicle attempted to correct the error and hit
the target. However, the divert and attitude control system that guides the
kill vehicle had to perform so many corrections that it ran out of fuel and
failed to complete the intercept. Army officials said the Thaad kill
vehicle properly acquired, designated and tracked the Storm target. The
Raytheon Ground-Based Radar, operating in a shadow role, acquired and
tracked the Thaad missile and Storm target correctly.
   An Army official said fixing the software problem should not delay the
next Thaad test, in February. The target still is expected to be a Coleman
Research Corp. Hera. The demonstration and validation test schedule calls
for 10 firings this year.

FIRST FLIGHT FOR HONDA ENGINE

Honda R&D has begun test flights of an experimental, 1,800-lb.-thrust-class
turbofan engine at California's Mojave Airport.
   The powerplant, called the Honda R&D Experimental Turbo Fan, made its
first flight on Dec. 18 mounted on the starboard, forward fuselage area of
a Boeing 727-100 test aircraft. The pilot for the 2.5-hr. initial flight
was Roger Wolfe.
   Testing was conducted mostly at 15,000 ft. at an average airspeed of 250
kt. During the flight, the engine instrumentation was checked, the
operability of the engine's controls verified, and powerplant performance
examined, including the engine's ability to relight.
   According to Honda officials, the engine has a bypass ratio of 4.3, a
dry weight of 485 lb. and is 46.3 in. long.
   The powerplant has been under development at Honda for more than a
decade, and flight tests are expected to extend through this year. Future
plans for commercializing the powerplant are indefinite, and Honda is still
unsure whether it eventually will attempt to enter into the aviation gas
turbine market.

PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON vetoed the $265-billion Fiscal 1996 defense

PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON vetoed the $265-billion Fiscal 1996 defense
authorization bill late last week, which was $7 billion more than he
sought. He cited objections to costly, unneeded weapon systems and
congressional pressure to build and deploy a national missile defense
system by 2003. Clinton said the latter would violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia and damage arms control efforts.
The President also objected to provisions requiring him to ask Congress for
funding within 45 days of ordering an overseas troop deployment. However,
he did not object to long lead funding for additional B-2 bombers.

that it will begin receiving in 1998 to the IAE V2530-A5. The order is
valued at $120 million (out of $650 million for the total aircraft). ANA
said it chose CFM56-5s for its A320 fleet but shifted to the V2530s for the
stretch A321s because of better fuel efficiency and lower noise levels.
Specifically, ANA said that with the IAE engines it is less likely to face

9,000 PILOTS HIRED IN `95

U.S. airlines hired more than 9,000 pilots in 1995 and should exceed that
number in 1996 as both major and regional carriers expand capacity to meet
growing demand.
   Major carriers added 2,300 new cockpit crewmembers to their rosters, or
about 1,000 more pilots than in 1994 and at least four times more than in
1993. That year, only 466 new pilots landed jobs with airlines, according
to AIR Inc., an Atlanta-based company specializing in airline career
development.
   New, entry-level airlines hired less than 100 pilots in 1995, compared
with 288 in 1994.
   Regional airline hiring also decreased last year, however, to about
1,700 cockpit crewmembers compared with 2,566 in 1994. Larger regionals
operating jet-powered transports hired about 1,600 new pilots. In 1994 they
hired 2,015.
   Of the 76,000 pilots actively flying for U.S. airlines, the number of
pilots on furlough declined to about 1,950 at the end of last year.
   Five major airlines account for 85% of that number, including American,
USAir, Delta, America West and Continental. Most of these carriers plan to
recall at least some of their furloughed pilots throughout this year.
   In addition, less than 50% of new airline pilots hired in 1995 had
military backgrounds. The decline reflects the shrinking pool of military
pilots available to the airline industry. In the past 20 years, about 75%
of all new-hire pilots came from the military, according to AIR Inc.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES U.S. MILITARY RESEARCH SATELLITE

A U. S. spacecraft sponsored in part by the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization (BMDO) has been launched by a Russian booster that also
carried an Earth resources satellite for India.
   The 550 lb. U.S. ``Skipper'' spacecraft was launched Dec. 28 from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome on board a Russian SL-6 booster that also carried the
larger Indian IRS-C imaging satellite. The Skipper satellite was placed
into the same initial 500-mi. orbit used by the Indian satellite. But
ground controllers at the U.S. Air Force satellite control facility in
Sunnyvale, Calif., will fire Skipper's hydrazine thrusters to lower it
gradually into an 80 X 90-mi. orbit inclined 97 deg. From that extremely
low orbit, the spacecraft will be used for BMDO-related aerobraking and
aerothermal chemistry studies related to the performance of reentry
vehicles entering the atmosphere.
   The satellite's instrument section containing spectrometers and
photometers was developed by Utah State University, while the satellite bus
was developed by the Moscow Aviation Institute and NPO Lavotchkin near
Moscow.

C-17S FLY LONG-RANGE AIR DROP MISSION

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
Two U.S. Air Force C-17s completed the first strategic air drop from this
model transport by flying 147 Army Rangers nonstop from Ft. Benning, Ga.,
to Egypt for a mass parachute drop.
   The aircraft flew recently from Lawson Army Airfield (Ga.) to a drop
zone near Cairo (loading troops photo center right). The 14.5-hr. flight
covered 6,400 naut. mi. and involved refueling from a KC-10 enroute (top
right). The C-17s descended to low level to drop members of the 3rd
Battalion, 75th U.S. Army Ranger Regiment from 800 ft. above the ground
(photo below). The soldiers were participating in Bright Star '95, a
U.S./Egyptian exercise. The C-17s were from the 437th Military Airlift Wing
at Charleston AFB, S.C.
   Col. Jack Pledger, deputy director of plans at Air Mobility Command
headquarters, said this small scale exercise shows how a larger number of
C-17s could air drop an Army brigade-size unit. He noted that six C-17s
also demonstrated this capability over the summer. The first four C-17s in
the formation dropped equipment while the next two carried paratroopers.
   The C-17 is also designed to fly into austere airfields for airland
operations and is now being used in Bosnia. All 120 of the aircraft will be
equipped with AAR-47 missile attack warning systems and ALE-47 flare
dispensers for self-protection.
   Pledger said the Air Force has received 23 C-17s and may be receiving as
many as 15 per year if plans for an accelerated multiyear acquisition are
approved. The Air Force was directed by the Defense Acquisition Board to
find the most favorable production rate. Pledger said the Air Force expects
some savings if the plan is approved since parts can be purchased in large
quantities to reduce costs. Also, five production C-17s used in the flight
test program are being reconfigured for delivery to operational squadrons.
If the accelerated plan is approved, the last of 120 C-17s would be
delivered in 2003.

F/A-18 DROP MODEL TESTS TO BEGIN

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS
LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, VA.

Flight tests of an F/A-18E/F drop model scheduled to begin soon will
provide important data on stall, post-stall and spin recovery
characteristics applicable to the full-scale aircraft's upcoming flight
test program.
   Mark A. Croom, drop model program manager at Langley's Vehicle Dynamics
Branch, expects the first drop to occur in March or April. The model will
be flown chiefly to explore the low-speed envelope, with a particular
emphasis on stall and post-stall regimes. The flights will also reliably
predict a vehicle's behavior during large amplitude or highly dynamic
conditions such as spin entry, he said.
   Plans call for making about 50 flights with the model during the
three-year program. The majority of drops will be made from 12,000 ft. or
less, and will last about 90 sec. Upgraded display and control consoles
will allow the model's flight crew to reconfigure the control system ``on
the fly,'' thereby maximizing the amount of research achieved per flight.
   In addition to being 25% larger than the F/A-18C/D, the F/A-18E/F design
incorporates subtle changes that may cause ``significant differences in
high-alpha flight dynamic behavior,'' Croom said. He cited the aircraft's
modified wing leading-edge extensions, for example, which may alter
vortical flows and thereby change spin recovery characteristics compared
with the original design.
   A smaller model of the F/A-18E/F has been tested in Langley's 20-ft.
Vertical Spin Tunnel to help determine developed spin and spin recovery
characteristics. The drop model flights will augment that work, according
to Croom.
   A NONPOWERED, 22%-SCALE F/A-18E/F drop model, which has a wing span of
nearly 10 ft., has been completed by Newport News, Va.-based Dynamic
Engineering Inc. and delivered to Langley for systems integration. During
the next few months, the 400-lb. vehicle will be fitted with 400 lb. of
instrumentation and other special equipment, increasing its drop weight to
about 900 lb. That includes ballast to give the model correct mass
characteristics for scaling.
   NASA researchers also want to use information from the drop flights to
refine the program's aerodynamic data base, and to formulate control laws
designed to enhance handling qualities of the full-scale airplane.
   NASA's F/A-18E/F drop model program began about three years ago when
design of the U.S. Air Force F-22 advanced tactical fighter and Navy
F/A-18E/F were well underway. Plans originally called for testing an F-22
drop model, but funding was inadequate and the program was terminated.
Although the Vehicle Dynamics Branch would prefer to conduct at least two
drop model programs simultaneously, limited money permits only one.
   Langley recently concluded drop tests of an X-31 model after conducting
25 flights during a two-year period. The longest of these was 128 sec. Two
final drops were made last autumn to evaluate differential action of the
canards for yaw control at high angles of attack. Using differential
pressure along the fuselage forebody, the canards ``proved as effective as
thrust vectoring'' to control directional movement, according to Croom.
   For the final flight, most of the aircraft's vertical stabilizer had
been removed to gather data to validate wind tunnel studies. Without the
stabilizer, directional control was lost at about 25 deg. angle of attack,
he said.
   In addition to the upcoming F/A-18E/F flights, the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA) is considering a follow-on, drop model program for
the X-31 or another aircraft type chiefly to evaluate flow control devices
activated by microelectronic machines. ARPA sponsored the X-31 flights and
is involved, along with the U.S. Navy, in the F/A-18E/F drop model
program.
   To improve launch capability for the upcoming flights, Langley
researchers have modified a Bell UH-1 aircraft by installing landing gear
skids that are higher and wider than the original unit. Previously, models
were suspended from an outrigger-type mount on the right side of the
aircraft. Although the system worked, it caused pilot workload to escalate
significantly during takeoff and landing.
   THE NEW SKIDS, WHICH WERE obtained by NASA from storage at Davis-Monthan
AFB, had been installed on a small number of specially modified UH-1
helicopters operated by the U.S. Army. They allow drop models to be carried
beneath the helicopter's fuselage and directly on its center of gravity,
which greatly improves launch operations as well as safety during takeoff
and landing, Croom said. A zero-impulse bolt (ZIB) is used to release the
model. The ZIB imparts virtually no force to the model during release.
   Langley researchers plan to conduct the F/A-18E/F drop flights from the
island side of NASA/Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va.
Previously, all drop model tests were based at Langley's Plum Tree Test
Range in a wetland region near the research center.
   During the next three years, Croom expects to install two small turbojet
engines in the F/A-18E/F drop model for a series of powered flights. Each
engine would be rated at about 280-lb. static thrust.
   To learn the water recovery techniques necessary at Wallops, NASA has
conferred with the U.S. Navy's program to launch and recover BQM-74 target
drones near Virginia Beach, Va. The key challenge for Croom's team,
however, was to learn how to seal models properly to prevent salt water
intrusion.
   Tests using the X-31 model demonstrated that the relatively ``soft''
water landings caused little or no damage to the vehicle. The F/A-18E/F
model will feature special salt water sensors designed to sever parachute
lines quickly upon landing. Rapid separation of the risers prevents
underwater inflation of the 63-ft.-dia. parachute, and subsequent sinking
of the $1-million vehicle. n

S-76BS TO THE RESCUE IN JAPAN

By:
PAUL PROCTOR

(SEATTLE)
A Sikorsky S-76B helicopter operated by the fire- and disaster-response
aviation unit of Japan's Niigata Prefecture performs training exercises in
the mountains surrounding the Lichinokura Reservoir. These include
rappelling (photo, below left), rescue (photo, lower right) and precision
forest fire water drops with a 240-gal. external bucket (photo, upper
right).
   The port city of Niigata is located on the western edge of central
Japan's narrow coastal plain and is hemmed in by mountains as near as
32-mi. away and up to 7,000-ft. high. The mountain scenery is a magnet for
nature lovers and the Niigata City-based helicopter unit is called to
evacuate injured hikers. It also is equipped to perform coastal search and
rescue and will provide back-up emergency services to the 1996 Winter
Olympic Games, to be held in neighboring Nagano Prefecture.
   Entering service in April, the 11,700-lb. gross weight S-76B quickly
distinguished itself when torrential rains in July caused flash flooding
and landslides. In the storm's aftermath, hundreds of residents in Niigata
Prefecture were isolated without electrical power, according to Makoto
Watanabe, unit commander.
   In one 5-hr. period the S-76B evacuated 212 people, making 19 round
trips in difficult weather. The twin-engine helicopter operated from an
advanced site complete with refueling capability to avoid ferry time to its
Niigata Airport base.
   The helicopter flew several other missions over the five days following
the sm, Watanabe said. These included rapid identification of highway
damage, downed bridges and power lines. The S-76B also provided timely
transportation of disaster response experts, relief teams and emergency
supplies. Community needs quickly were identified where conventional
communications links were down.
   Niigata's S-76B is configured with a rescue hoist and provisions for
four litter positions, Nightsun searchlight, public address speaker and
snow skis for winter operations. It is flown by contract pilots from Aero
Asahi Corp., Japan's largest private helicopter operator.
   A second S-76B, ordered at the same time, is operational with Yamanashi
Prefecture, located at the base of Mt. Fuji. It is equipped with a
television communications broadcast system and forward-looking infrared
(Flir) camera. In July, it rescued an injured teenager in mountainous
terrain at an altitude of 9,400-ft.
   Niigata unit operations normally are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. daily.
Aircraft currently are flown single-pilot, with a mechanic seated in the
copilot's position as a safety coordinator and observer. The addition of
night flights is under study but would require two-pilot crews. Typical
duty staffing includes the aircraft captain, an engineer, a mechanic, a
dispatcher and four to six specially trained rescue crew.
   Niigata Prefecture purchased the S-76B with a subsidy provided by
Japan's Ministry of Home Affairs.
   Both helicopters are powered by twin Pratt & Whitney PT6B-36
turboshafts.

CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES can be modified and effectively
incorporated into training for single-pilot helicopter operations,
according to a report by the Flight Safety Foundation, Arlington, Va.
Although concepts must be applied differently when only one pilot is
involved, the basic CRM principles of efficiently seeking and evaluating
information, overcoming communications barriers and being assertive at
appropriate times remain the same. Other CRM training benefits for the

A PROTOTYPE OPEN-ARCHITECTURE MACHINE tool controller is being tested in
trials at major U.S. corporations. Boeing plans to become a factory-floor
testbed soon. Developed by the Commerce Dept.'s National Institute of
Standards and Technology, the enhanced machine controller (EMC) allows
screen displays to be tailored to the operator's preference or previous
experience and simplifies modifications and upgrades. Potential payoffs
include reduced employee retraining, ``plug and play'' hardware and
software compatibility, and an expanded supplier pool, according to
Frederick Proctor, NIST robotics researcher, Washington. EMC-equipped
machine tools also should enhance manufacturing line flexibility.

satellites. The frequency-doubled, green beam is one of the brightest
lasers available. It can be precisely pointed yet diverges to a beam just a
few yards across after traveling hundreds of miles, according to Lloyd
Hackel, associate program leader for commercial lasers. A version of the
laser also quickly removes paint from aircraft and ships without harming
the substrate. The method vaporizes a small amount of paint and creates a
plasma which in turn generates an intense acoustic wave to perform the
stripping.

A340 BREAKTHROUGH

By:
COMPILED BY FRANCES FIORINO

AIRBUS HAS MADE AN A340 BREAKTHROUGH IN CHINA. Air China is in final
negotiations to acquire three aircraft. Whether the A340s will come from
the stock of six that China Aviation Supplies Corp. (CASC), the country's
purchasing agent, already has on order is unclear. Also unclear is whether
they will be configured for VIPs or passengers. Airbus wants the aircraft
in passenger configuration to broaden its market impact beyond the five
A340s ordered by China Eastern. Two years ago, Airbus thought it had an
A340 sale to China Southern, but a turf battle erupted between the airline
and the CASC over who was doing the ordering. The upshot was that China
Southern remains a firm Boeing customer--including Seattle's first for the
777. Air China also is likely to place 10 777 orders early this year.

REDUCING INJURIES

By:
COMPILED BY FRANCES FIORINO

A VARIATION IN PASSENGER ``BRACE'' POSITION can have a significant effect
on the magnitude and type of injuries sustained during aircraft landing
accidents, especially as new 16g seats come on-line. Extensive research
following the January, 1989, Boeing 737-400 accident in Kegworth, England,
found fewer ``leg flail'' injuries occur when passengers in the brace
position place their lower legs slightly aft of the vertical, or
knee-joints, with feet flat on the floor. A report summary by Arlington,
Va.-based Flight Safety Foundation includes recommendations for
high-friction carpeting to inhibit leg sliding and a review of under-seat

BACK TO BOSNIA

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

UNMANNED RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL RESUME operations over Bosnia and
Croatia in mid-March, instead of Jan. 1 as some senior officials wanted.
That gives program officials extra time to train with and devise tactics
for the new Synthetic Aperture Radar, which allows the Predator UAV to
observe the troubled region even through thick winter cloud cover. Three
Predators likely will operate from a base near Sarmellek, Hungary, about
130 mi. northwest of the main U.S. base in Tuzla, Bosnia. Also, Pentagon
acquisition chief Paul Kaminski finally has ruled that the long-endurance
UAVs will be operated by the Air Force, unless they are ship-based.

HURRY UP, SHORTY

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

THERE IS A NEW HURRY-UP COMPETITION and limited development program for a
smaller, short-range UAV that can operate as a land or ship-based scout.
Demand for the 3-4-hr. endurance, 120-mi. range aircraft is intense enough
that Kaminski has designated the Tactical UAV (TUAV) project an Advanced
Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD). The new ACTD, under which 32 UAVs
would be produced initially, combines requirements for the close and
maneuver UAVs into a single aircraft. The TUAV is projected to cost
$300,000-350,000 per aircraft, including the electro-optical and infrared
sensor package.

PAY UP, UNCLE

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

CONTRACTORS FOR THE CANCELED A-12 Navy strike aircraft--McDonnell Douglas
and General Dynamics--are due back in Federal Claims Court this week to
make their pitches for just how much the Navy owes them. Predictions of the
award for each range from $350 million-1 billion (see p. 11). The two
companies filed a lawsuit four years ago, seeking to change the terms of
the A-12 cancellation from ``terminated for default,'' which means no
reimbursement for some expenses. Late last month, Judge Robert Hodges ended
the trial after three weeks, ruling the A-12 had been canceled ``for the
convenience of the government.''

WHEN IN DOUBT APPOINT A PANEL

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

HOUSE-SENATE INTELLIGENCE CONFEREES have agreed to temporarily set aside
the contentious issue of whether to begin procurement of a new generation
of smaller reconnaissance satellites (AW&ST Nov. 13, 1995, p. 24). Their
compromise calls for the appointment of a panel of experts. By May 1, the
panel is to determine whether ``smallsats'' can be procured immediately, as
proponents in the House contend, or whether several more years of
technology development is needed, as the Senate and National Reconnaissance
Office maintain. The compromise cleared the way--finally--for the full
House and Senate to approve a Fiscal 1996 intelligence authorization bill
shortly before they adjourned for their holiday break.

POLITICAL SCIENCE

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

REP. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR. (R.-Wis.) may have some tough choices to
make. He is the odds-on favorite to succeed the House Science Committee
chairman, Robert Walker (R.-Pa.), next year following Walker's stunning
announcement last month that he will not seek reelection. But another
member's planned retirement also could put Sensenbrenner in line to chair
a House Judiciary subcommittee--a prospect the lawyer-turned-lawmaker has
eyed with relish in the past. A Republican caucus will make the final
appointments, but in any case new House rules limit lawmakers to one
chairmanship apiece.

NOT PROBLEMS, JUST CHALLENGES

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

AFTER EXAMINING TECHNOLOGY development for reusable launch vehicles, a
National Research Council panel gives NASA and the industry teams on the
X-33 demonstrator program generally favorable marks. But the panel sees
some tough technical problems: Pushing the performance of either the Space
Shuttle Main Engine or the Russian RD-0120 engine enough will be ``an
extremely difficult challenge.'' Both welding and repairing the
aluminum-lithium 2195 alloy for tanks are ``major areas of concern.'' And
health monitoring systems and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques
are not laid out in ``a well-ordered program to identify which measurements
will be made or how NDE will be used to penetrate multiple layers of
material.''

THE U.S. AIR FORCE

By:
EDITED BY BRUCE D. NORDWALL

THE U.S. AIR FORCE PLANS TO EQUIP its RC-135 Advanced Range Instrumentation
Aircraft (ARIA) at Edwards AFB with a satellite communication link. The
service has contracted to equip five aircraft with the Honeywell/Racal
multichannel MCS-6000 satcom system under a $3.5-million contract.
Honeywell sees the system, developed for commercial air transport and
business jets, as a foot in the door for military applications. The Air
Force used its C-135 Speckled Trout aircraft to test the ability of a
number of systems, including this one, to communicate with Inmarsat C
satellites in flights over both poles (AW&ST Apr. 4, 1994, p. 66). The
Honeywell/Racal team spent the last year developing the STU-3 secure voice
interface with the communications management unit, which gained Inmarsat
approval in January, 1995. The MCS-6000 system is currently in use on
Gulfstreams and a number of wide-body airline fleets. The ARIA fleet will
use the Tecom T-4000 high-gain antenna system.

AMERICAN AIRLINES INTENDS TO USE the Honeywell/Trimble HT9100 GNSS
navigation management system to replace Omega systems in its fleet of
MD-80, DC-10 and Boeing 727 aircraft. Honeywell is scheduled to deliver
more than 400 of the Global Positioning System-based navigation systems,

capabilities, and to give full flight, lateral navigation performance.
Required Navigation Performance/Actual Navigation Performance (RNP/ANP),
which measure the required accuracy and uncertainty in position,
respectively, are to be similar to that of the Honeywell 747-400 FANS 1
software. Pilot interface will be through a multifunction control and

THE FAA'S GPS LOCAL AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM

By:
EDITED BY BRUCE D. NORDWALL

THE FAA'S GPS LOCAL AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (LAAS) could be delayed if key
decisions on requirements and standards are not made soon, according to the
Air Transport Assn. of America (ATA). LAAS is being developed to provide
the accuracy needed for automatic landings to touchdown under the worst
weather conditions. But without decisions on LAAS standards, the first
aircraft operators who install GPS equipment run the risk of having to redo
their installations when the characteristics are nailed down. Choice of
data link is a key issue. Roger Fleming, ATA president, recently told the
House subcommittee on aviation that there are two frequencies that are
about equally good for LAAS--VHF and GPS L1. If the FAA does not make a
choice soon, he suggested that Chairman John J. Duncan, Jr. (R.-Tenn.) flip
a coin and choose one.

MALAYSIA CONSIDERS CL-415 FOR DUAL ROLE

By:
DAVID HUGHES
MICHAEL MECHAM

(BOSTONLANGKAWI, MALAYSIA)
The government of Malaysia is considering a proposal from Bombardier for
several CL-415s for coastal patrol and aerial fire-fighting.
   The CL-415s would be equipped with a radar, Flir and searchlights, but
they also could be configured to perform their traditional fire-fighting
role.
   The aircraft can scoop 6,100 liters (1,600 gal.) in 12 sec. from a lake
or ocean, drop the water on a fire and then repeat the process. The
aircraft also can convert the water to foam by injecting chemicals into
it.
   A CL-415 flew daily exhibitions last month at the Langkawi International
Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition in Malaysia after already appearing in
Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Syria, Cyprus and the Dubai air show. Its next air
show appearance will be in February at Asian Aerospace `96 in Singapore.
   Bombardier's five-month, 21-nation tour is part of a multimillion-dollar
effort to demonstrate the capabilities of the aircraft in various
roles--including fire-fighting, maritime surveillance, search-and-rescue
and environmental monitoring. The tour will also take the 415 to Indonesia,
the Philippines, Japan and Taiwan. Bombardier is leasing the demonstrator
aircraft from the province of Quebec, Canada, and has repainted it. SISAM,
a subsidiary of Alitalia, is providing the flight crews. SISAM operates a
fleet of CL-415s and CL-215s in Italy.
   Ray Mathieu, marketing director for Canadair's Amphibious Aircraft Div.,
said the CL-415 demonstrations at Langkawi were made to the Maritime
Enforcement Coordinating Center and the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The air
force would operate the aircraft for the coordinating center if CL-415s are
acquired.
   Japanese authorities became interested in the airplane after the Kobe
earthquake, which caused disastrous fires last January. Mathieu said
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is now assisting Bombardier in marketing the
415 in Japan. This arrangement grew out of Mitsubishi's relationship as a
risk-sharing partner on the Global Express and de Havilland Dash 8. CL-215T
turboprop- and CL-215 piston-powered aircraft have been leased in recent
years by several U.S. states.
   The CL-215Ts are turboprop aircraft created in a retrofit program in
which piston engines were replaced. These aircraft do not have the glass
cockpit of the newly manufactured CL-415. Two CL-215Ts were evaluated for
two months in 1994 during fire season by the Los Angles County Fire Dept.,
and two more are being evaluated now.
   The two CL-215Ts on duty in Los Angeles can be airborne 5 min. after a
fire alarm is received and are being used primarily to fight wild fires in
urban areas. Representatives from the Japan National Fire Research
Institute recently observed the 215Ts fighting fires in the Los Angeles
area.
   Darrell Higuchi, deputy chief of the Los Angeles County Fire Dept., said
the county probably will continue to lease aircraft each year for 60-90
days during brush fire season when the Santa Ana winds are a factor. There
are many bodies of water in the county, as well as the nearby ocean, where
the aircraft can scoop water. About 80% have boat traffic, but local
agreements call for lakes and reservoirs to be cleared for scooping
operations if necessary. Higuchi said the 215Ts make 6-20 airdrops of water
per hour on a fire.
   Bombardier also worked with the Swedish Coast Guard last summer to
demonstrate a CL-215 in the dual role of fire-fighting and coastal patrol,
with the intent of Sweden looking at the CL-415 later.
   One element of the Swedish demonstrations was pollution monitoring,
according to James Cherry, president of Canadair's Amphibious Aircraft Div.
By landing in the water near vessels suspected of discharging their bilges
illegally, the aircraft can collect samples for later analysis. Bombardier
officials said the evaluation may continue this summer.
   The Canadian company has delivered two CL-415s to Quebec, four to Italy
and seven to France, and is building about 10 of the aircraft per year. The
aircraft costs $18 million and is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada
PW123AF turboprop engines.

MALAYSIAN STARTUP EYES ECO-TOURISM

By:
MICHAEL MECHAM

(LANGKAWI, MALAYSIA)
Saeaga Airlines is banking on eco-tourism to feed an unusual route network
that crosses the island borders of eastern Malaysia, the southern
Philippines and Indonesia to reach unspoiled and renowned destinations.
   Saeaga will begin charter operations in January and scheduled services
this spring using two de Havilland Dash 8s and a Canadair Regional Jet
flying from a home base in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, to Davao and General
Santos in the southern Philippines and Manado in north Sulawesi,
Indonesia.
   The aircraft sale, which is valued at $49 million, marks the first use
by a single operator outside Canada of the Dash 8 and RJ. De Havilland also
placed four Dash 8-200s and two Dash 8-300s with another Malaysian
regional, Pelangi Air, during LIMA `95 here. These were the first
placements of Dash 8s in Malaysia, bringing to 42 the total orders for the
Asia/Pacific region. It is also the first sale of an RJ in the region.
   Cross-border flight operations are jealously guarded by national
carriers, which often do not operate 50-seat aircraft, whether turboprop or
jet. As a result, the cities may be under-served by the tourist market
simply because connections for foreigners are a burden.
   Saeaga will buck this trend, taking advantage of a memorandum signed
last February by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines to promote
regional trade opportunities, including air travel, in what is called the
East Asean Growth Area.
   Kota Kinabalu is an established tourist destination, but other Malaysian
cities, such as Miri, are harder to reach. Miri is about 100 mi. from the
Sarawak Chamber, said to be the world's largest cave system. The region
offers rain forests and excellent diving in ``untouched'' locations.
   ``This region is undeveloped for air routes,'' said Rob Greatbatch of
Airtrade Aviation Consultants in Singapore.
   Airtrade and another consultancy, EAA Malaysia, are establishing the
airline on behalf of its owners, Ekran Berhad, a Malaysian company with
interests in hotels, and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.
Ekran also operates Sabah Air and Ekran Air, which will turn over their
routes in the region now being served by helicopters.
   Part of the consultants' tasks will be to find a permanent management
team. Recruitment of flight and cabin crews has already begun.
   Saeaga's strategy is based on the top-end tourist market from the U.S.
and Europe that wants to see unspoiled natural areas. For those seeking the
unusual, Greatbatch suggests that diving in the Spratly Islands is a
possibility.
   Since Saeaga will offer some competition to the region's national
carriers, it will look to airlines outside the area, such as in Singapore
and Hong Kong, for booking agreements. The marketing strategy is that
Saeaga will extend their tourism packages. But much of the airline's
success will depend on development of tourist facilities in places like
Balikpapan, Pontianak, Zamboanga and Tarakan.
   Saeaga's Dash 8-200 will be flown in a one-class, 37-seat configuration.
Its 300 will have 50 seats, as will the Canadair Regional Jet.

MALAYSIANS SEEK KUALA LUMPUR HUB

(LANGKAWI, MALAYSIA)
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says Kuala Lumpur's new airport should try
to equal Singapore's better known Changi Airport and become a regional
hub.
   That will be a stiff challenge since Changi is regarded as one of the
world's best. But Mahathir says the transformation of the nation's economy
from a simple supplier of raw materials--chiefly rubber and tin--into a
supplier of manufactured goods will support such a goal. Malaysia's economy
has had an average annual growth of at least 8% for the past eight years,
and manufactured goods now account for 80% of its exports.
   Emphasizing Kuala Lumpur as a regional hub would help Malaysia Airlines
grow, give Malaysia greater bargaining power in international air services
negotiations, and help serve as an anchor for Mahathir's Vision 2020
program to promote the country's development of a manufacturing base.
   That strategy assumes that Kuala Lumpur's present airport at Subang will
become a prime industrial location for aerospace manufacturing. The airport
will remain active for military, police and maintenance/overhaul activities
but be closed to passengers once the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport
at Sepang opens.
   However, Malaysia is a skeptic about an ``open skies'' air services
policy. Singapore has the opposite view and serves as a pass-through hub
for numerous foreign carriers, particularly from Europe and the U.S., on
destinations elsewhere in Southeast Asia and Australasia.
   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Singapore would not maintain a
competitive advantage because of its more liberal policy. ``I don't think
many countries offer open skies,'' Liong Sik said during the recent
aerospace conference here sponsored by AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY and
the Asian Strategy & Leadership Institute. ``Other countries haven't
offered open skies to Singapore.''
   The new airport at Sepang is 30 mi. south of Kuala Lumpur and is
regarded as the largest single project undertaken by the Malaysian
government. Built on a greenfield site of 25,000 acres, it will cost an
estimated 13 billion ringgit ($5.3 billion) and is to open by January,
1998.
   First-phase construction includes a main terminal of 246,333 sq. meters
(2.65 million sq. ft.), two 4,000-meter (13,120-ft.) runways with an
8,000-ft. separation, and 80 gates and remote aircraft stands. Annual
capacity is expected to be 25 million at opening and 60 million by 2020.
The site is large enough to accommodate 90 million passengers.
   The Sepang airport's opening will close Kuala Lumpur's smaller airport
at Sungei Besi, which had been proposed as a city airport for regional
services. But Liong Sik says Sungei Besi is to be converted for
development.

GULFSTREAM RAMPS UP G5 TEST PROGRAM
The Gulfstream 5 features new engines and a new wing--the aircraft is
14,400 lb. heavier and flies 6,000 ft. higher than its predecessor, the
G4SP.

By:
PAUL PROCTOR

(SEATTLE)
Gulfstream is spooling up its G5 flight test program with a goal of
obtaining FAA certification in October and comparable European
authorization by year-end.
   A second G5, serial no. 502, already has begun ground-based static
testing at Gulfstream Aerospace's Savannah, Ga., factory. The next G5 to
become airborne, serial no. 503, is scheduled to lift off later this
month.
   Gulfstream's first G5, serial No. 501, performed a successful 1 hr. 18
min. maiden flight from Savannah on Nov. 28 (AW&ST Dec. 4, 1995, p. 101).
The demonstration put Gulfstream solidly on track in the race to bring to
market the world's first, 6,500-naut.-mi.-range luxury business jet. More
importantly, Gulfstream retained about a one-year lead on competitor
Bombardier's all-new Global Express.
   Gulfstream claims more than a $2-billion backlog for the Gulfstream G5,
which will cost more than $35 million, complete with customized passenger
interior, avionics and exterior paint. Bombardier said it holds more than
40 orders for the Global Express, which is of similar range and price.
   A total of four G5s will participate in flight test and certification
flying, according to Lee Johnson, director of flight test operations. The
third aircraft to fly, serial no. 504, is scheduled to become airborne in
February. The fourth aircraft in the flight test fleet, no. 505, is to fly
in June.
   As of mid-December, the pioneer G5 had accumulated 8.4 hr. of air time
over four flights. Testing was interrupted to install a trailing-cone
assembly and a stall/spin chute. The latter will be used later in the
program during stall characterization work.
   Initial test points already logged include stability, control and
handling checks over a variety of flight regimes. Aircraft speed has ranged
from 130% of estimated stall speed to 300 kt. and altitudes as high as
20,000 ft. have been achieved, Johnson said.
   The flights were ``smooth and problem-free'' and the aircraft handled
well, John O'Meara, chief test pilot, said.
   The function of every system on board the aircraft, many of them all-new
or significant updates from the predecessor G4SP, also has been checked,
Johnson said. Initial confirmation of aircraft aerodynamic projections has
been performed and brief autopilot tests run. The flaps and landing gear
successfully have been cycled.
   Performance of the G5's twin 14,700-lb.-thrust BMW Rolls-Royce BR710-48
powerplants also is being closely monitored. The G5 is the first aircraft
to be powered by the all-new engine series. Evaluations include ``rapid
reversal'' throttle changes and throttle ``slams.'' Thrust reversers have
been deployed on every landing.
   Through the remainder of the flight test program the no. 501 G5 is
expected to continue to expand the performance envelope, including the
type's planned top altitude of 51,000 ft. and maximum operating speed of
Mach 0.9. A stall series is planned to be performed to evaluate the
aircraft's new, high-performance wing.
   OVERALL, THE G5 has a projected maximum takeoff weight of 89,000 lb.,
compared with the G4SP's 74,600 lb. Maximum cruise altitude is 6,000 ft.
higher than the G4SP and cruise speed is slightly faster at Mach 0.88.
Despite flying heavier, faster and higher, the G5's new wing is expected to
require a Mach trim system only at speeds of Mach 0.85 and above, if at
all, Johnson said.
   Fuselage structure also has been beefed up to provide a 6,000-ft. cabin
at 51,000-ft. This compares with 6,500 ft. at 45,000-ft. for the G4SP.
   Gulfstream serial no. 503 will be used to closely evaluate the function
and reliability of aircraft systems including fuel, electrical, hydraulics
and brakes. It will perform additional flight control tests and verify
braking and steering.
   This aircraft probably will fly to 3,700-ft.-high Roswell, N.M., this
June for takeoff and landing performance trials. It also is the likely
choice to shuttle to Fairbanks, Alaska, for cold weather tests in early
March.
   The third G5 to join the flight test program, serial no. 504, will be
used to closely examine engine and aerodynamic performance. The latter task
includes in-flight analysis and verification of estimated flight and
structural loads, Johnson said. This airframe also will be used to verify
noise footprint, with measurements to be performed at a small airport
outside Savannah.
   Gulfstream also plans to use the aircraft to conduct icing trials this
spring, weather conditions permitting.
   G5 no. 504 also will evaluate cabin environmental system performance
including pressurization, ventilation, heating and cooling, Johnson said.
Equipment cooling will be examined during planned hot weather tests in
Savannah and possibly Roswell or El Centro, Calif.
   G5 serial no. 505 will perform required HIRF (High Intensity Radiated
Field) and lightning strike tests. An FAA pilot will be on board for
certain function and reliability and crew-workload tests needed for
certification.
   Overall, about 1,700 hr. of G5 flight test is planned, Johnson said. At
the height of activity, the test program will employ about 110 full-time
workers, including technicians, engineers, support personnel and six
pilots. n

GLOBAL EXPRESS SEEKS SPEED EDGE

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
Bombardier is beginning to assemble the first long-range Global Express
business jet and will receive the wing and wing box/center fuselage from
Mitsubishi later this month as the company prepares for a first flight in
September.
   John Lawson, president of the Canadair Business Aircraft Div., said the
all-new business jet will be certified to the same standards as the Boeing
777 and will meet extended twin-engine operations (ETOPS) criteria such as
systems architecture and redundancy. Like the 777, Global Express is being
developed on IBM/Dassault Systemes Catia computer-aided design
workstations. Data are being exchanged via satellite communications among
the various partners, including Bombardier's Canadair, de Havilland and
Short Brothers units, as well as Mitsubishi in Japan.
   The Gulfstream 5 completed its first flight in November, giving it
nearly a year lead over the Global Express. But Lawson notes the Bombardier
aircraft has a number of advantages in the competition, such as a larger
cabin and better range at high Mach numbers. While both the Global Express
and Gulfstream 5 fly 6,500 naut. mi. at Mach 0.80, the Global Express is
expected to fly nearly as far (6,330 naut. mi.) at Mach 0.85. The aircraft
is also expected to fly 5,000 naut. mi. at Mach 0.88. ``Gulfstream knows
how difficult it will be to compete with this aircraft once we fly,'' he
said.
   Demand for the Global Express prompted the Bombardier board of directors
last year to add 12 more aircraft to the early production schedule--six in
fiscal 1998 and six in 1999. The company has received firm orders for the
first six additional aircraft since availability was announced last June.
   In all, Bombardier has announced more than 40 firm orders. This includes
sales in the Middle East where TAG Aeronautics, its exclusive distributor,
converted four options to firm orders at the Dubai air show in November.
This brings TAG's total orders to 10. Bombardier officials said the actual
figure for Global Express orders is ``well in excess'' of 44.
   Lawson also expects to see a government market develop for the aircraft
after it is in production. The aircraft could be used to transport heads of
state or high-ranking government officials.
   Military versions are also possible. Lawson said Bombardier is
interested in supplying aircraft for the U.K.'s Airborne Standoff Radar
(Astor) surveillance aircraft program. Teams led by Loral Europe Ltd. and
Raytheon are analyzing a variety of aircraft as possible high-altitude
surveillance platforms during a 17-month project definition phase being
funded by the British Ministry of Defense. When configured as a business
jet, Global Express can climb directly to 43,000 ft. starting at maximum
takeoff weight, Lawson said. It has a ceiling of 51,000 ft.The aircraft has
two generators for each engine, two batteries and an APU, so it has ample
power for the mission, according to Bombardier.
   The corporate version of the Global Express costs $29.5 million
``green,'' and the typical price for an interior will be $3.5 million.
Bombardier's completion center at Tucson, Ariz., will be actively competing
for Global Express interior work, but customers will be at liberty to pick
other suppliers.
   Lawson noted that the Tucson facility recently completed the interior of
the first Canadair Special Edition (a modified Regional Jet), which has a
cabin about the same size as Global Express'. The Special Edition interior
weighs 5,750 lb. in a 46.2-ft.-long cabin, versus the 6,000 lb. allowed for
Global Express' 48-ft. cabin. Lawson said the Special Edition interior
shows that Bombardier's weight allowance for Global Express completion is
sufficient. The Special Edition interior was designed for the TAG Group, a
Middle Eastern customer.
   THE FIRST GLOBAL EXPRESS FORWARD fuselage barrel arrived in Montreal
late last month and is being mated to the nose. This assembly will then be
shipped to de Havilland at Downsview, Ontario, where Global Express
production will take place. Mitsubishi will deliver its first wing and wing
box/center fuselage section from Nagoya, Japan, to Downsview in late
January. These components will be mated by late February. All aircraft
sections should be assembled by late March or early April. The tail and
rear fuselage are being built by de Havilland.
   Bombardier also is completing an integrated systems test rig at
Downsview. This will be used to test the Honeywell Primus 2000XP integrated
avionics suite, the Sextant flight control system, as well as hydraulic and
electrical systems. Testing of hardware and computer software is expected
to reduce technical risk.
   Lawson noted that Bombardier has a good track record in bringing
aircraft to market as promised, as shown with five aircraft during the past
five years. The company is now producing 140 aircraft per year, making it
the fifth largest producer of civil aircraft worldwide, according to
Lawson. And the Regional Jet, the Challenger 604 and the Lear 60 all
exceeded expectations as far as initial performance guarantees. Now that
wind tunnel tests are complete, Bombardier has reduced the 5,540-ft.
(1,689-meter) balanced field length estimate for Global Express by 440 ft.
to 5,100 ft. (1,554 meters). This is at maximum takeoff weight, at sea
level with standard (ISA) temperatures.
   At Dubai, Bombardier also said the manufacturer's empty weight for the
aircraft is now guaranteed at 40,700 lb. (18,462 kg.) 2%. With the
6,000-lb. (2,720-kg.) outfitting allowance, the empty weight comes up to
46,700 lb. (21,183 kg.). Global Express also achieves relatively low
takeoff and approach speeds at maximum weights with both slats and flaps on
the wings. Approach speed at maximum landing weight is 125 kt. and rotation
speed at maximum takeoff weight is 130 kt.
   Bombardier officials believe there is a market for 550-850 long-range
business aircraft and said sales to date have been solid. ``These are not
phantom deposits,'' Lawson said.

SALE OF DEFENSE UNIT NOT IN TI'S CARDS

By:
ANTHONY L. VELOCCI, JR.

(NEW YORK)
Texas Instruments' aerospace and defense business is considered by many
industry observers a prime candidate for the auction block, but that's not
the view from Dallas.
   The operation is not for sale, and top management are adamant in their
commitment to hold onto it. Speculation about the business' future has been
rekindled with the recent announcement by Westinghouse Electric Corp. that
it will sell its Electronics Systems unit.
   TI looks upon the industry's consolidation very differently than many
other large companies who are making bold, strategic moves in that
process.
   ``We don't think bigger is necessarily better,'' says Systems Group
President Dean Clubb. ``Our model is to acquire capabilities that will help
us satisfy the needs of our customers while giving us a competitive edge.
We are working that angle all the time.''
   More often than not, properties that the Group does purchase are apt to
be relatively small, niche acquisitions.
   For example, TI recently acquired PhotoTelesis Corp., a defense
contractor located in San Antonio. TI, which is a major supplier of
electro-optics for military applications, was drawn to the eight-year-old
firm because of its specialty in advanced imagery and data transmission via
military radio. The technology allows images from a battlefield to be
transmitted almost instantly over a satellite to monitors at a command
center.
   With the addition of PhotoTelesis, TI expects to be able to expand its
markets and strengthen its strategy of equipping a digital battlefield,
according to John Wright, manager of the Group's Advanced Land Combat
Systems.
   ``We're not that interested in purchasing things just to get bigger,''
said Clubb, who also is a TI executive vice president.
   The last several years certainly bear that out. During this time, any
major U.S. aerospace/defense company interested in growth by acquisition
has had ample opportunity to implement such a strategy. It is evident that
TI has chosen another route.
   The contribution of aerospace and defense to TI's revenues has dropped
to less than 20% from almost 30% in the early 1990s. Of the corporation's
$10 billion in revenues in 1994, about $1.8 billion came from the Group.
But it has remained solidly profitable, with net margins in the 8-12%
range.
   LOWER U.S. DEFENSE procurement is chiefly responsible for the decline,
although explosive growth in semiconductor sales tends to exaggerate the
dwindling proportion of the Group's overall contribution. TI's strong
financial performance continues to be driven by its semiconductor business,
which accounts for about 75% of its revenue and more than 90% of its
profit.
   From Wall Street, TI's aerospace and defense business is seen as having
insufficient critical mass--or at least approaching such a state--to
compete effectively long-term in an industry that is rapidly
consolidating.
   Some analysts think the operation could be overwhelmed by competitors
who are participating in the consolidation, such as rival electronics and
missile producers Raytheon, Hughes Aircraft and perhaps even Loral. In
time, their expanding technology base and growing economies of scale could
put the TI operation at a cost disadvantage, they argue.
   ``One thing you can't do in this kind of an industry environment is
dither, and TI has been doing little more than standing on the sidelines
and watching as the Group's biggest competitors consolidate,'' according to
one Wall Street veteran of recent large aerospace/defense transactions.
``This is a very capable business, but at this point it probably has more
value to another company.''
   Not as far as TI management is concerned. ``We're a valued part of the
company because of our systems expertise,'' Clubb said.
   He ought to know. As a member of the TI Strategy Leadership Team, he is
among a small group of TI executives who shape the strategic direction of
this $10-billion corporation. Virtually every member of the company's top
management, from the chairman and CEO on down, has been president of the
sector containing TI's aerospace and defense business.
   For years, TI has aggressively promoted a cross fertilization of ideas
and technology between the Group and the company's more commercial-oriented
business sectors. Under contract to the government, TI created the first
forward-looking infrared systems using cryogenically-cooled detectors in
1964, and in 1977 created an uncooled detector that dramatically reduced
the size and power requirements of thermal imaging. The Group remains a
major conduit for the transfer of technology developed for military
applications.
   ``It's important to understand the culture of Texas Instruments,'' James
Schwendinger said. He is head of the aerospace and defense practice of
Deloitte & Touche, a management consulting firm. ``TI is top tier when it
comes to knowledge transfer, and their aerospace and defense business
figures very prominently in that process. They also have kept the business
pretty well aligned in terms of operating performance and cost-control.
   ``So what if [the Group] remains a second-tier player, as long as it is
the supplier of choice in some very specialized technologies?'' he added.
``Wall Street may look at this part of the Texas Instruments puzzle as
lacking critical mass, but I would be very surprised to see TI cut it lose
unless the business becomes a financial drain, and I don't expect that to
happen.''
   The Group has three major objectives: profitable growth, higher quality
and lower production costs by at least 20%--possibly more--depending on how
closely TI and its military customers work together.
   Clubb expects the Group's backlog, which has been declining in recent
years, to begin growing again within the next two years. In addition to
pursuing follow-ups to existing military programs, the company is exploring
other defense markets that it is not now serving.
   Traditionally, international sales have accounted for 12-14% of the
operation's revenues. That is expected to increase substantially. ``There
are many foreign countries standing in line, ready to buy our
precision-guided weapons and sensors,'' Clubb said. ``We're just waiting
for government [licensing].''
   THE GROUP'S STRATEGIC business plan calls for commercializing more of
the operation's defense technology, as well as targeting possible
opportunities in air traffic control. Texas Instruments withdrew from the
FAA market several years ago.
   Clubb leaves no doubt about where the quality initiative fits into the
Group's overall business strategy. ``Winning with quality may sound fairly
easy, but our objective is to produce products at a level that would cause
existing and prospective customers to think twice before awarding a
contract to anyone else.''

U.K. TILT TO EUROPE URGED ON DEFENSE

By:
JOHN D. MORROCCO

(LONDON)
British lawmakers are urging greater government support for preserving the
nation's defense industrial base and closer cooperation with other European
nations as a means to that end.
   A joint Parliamentary report by the Defense and Trade and Industry
committees criticized the government's short-term approach to defense
procurement which emphasizes lowest cost. It called for the Ministry of
Defense to adopt a long-term approach to procurement aimed at retaining key
strategic capabilities within the U.K. and greater use of technology
demonstrator programs.
   The government's policy of straddling the Atlantic in terms of defense
collaboration was also criticized. Lawmakers said they saw no problems with
U.K. companies collaborating with U.S. companies where it was ``mutually
advantageous.'' But they argued that increased collaboration with other
European countries is ``crucial'' to the survival of the British defense
industry.
   Lawmakers believe immense savings can be achieved through rationalizing
Europe's defense industry and eliminating duplication and subsidies.
   Specifically, the report says it is imperative that the U.K. be fully
involved in any future European armaments agency ``from its inception.''
France and Germany are discussing the creation of such an agency that could
initially exclude the U.K. British officials fear this would give French
and German companies an early lead in European cooperative programs that
might result in the marginalization of British defense companies.
   Lawmakers also want to see any such efforts go beyond just coordinating
and managing joint programs. It foresees greater savings through
coordination of military requirements, perhaps by the Western European
Armaments Group, an agency of the Western European Union.
   But the underlying message of the report was that more attention must be
paid to the long-term health of the U.K. defense industry. Awarding
contracts to foreign suppliers based on competitive cost reasons alone
could result in the long-term loss of critical domestic skills.
   Preserving the U.K. defense technology base should be a ``priority,''
the report stated. Such considerations should be ``built into the
procurement process from the initial stages right through to the decision
to order the equipment.'' Specifically, lawmakers called for:
  -- Identification of critical technologies for the industry and
development of strategies to retain a leading edge.
  -- Promotion of dual-use technologies.
  -- Increased funding for technology demonstrator programs.
  -- Clearer guidelines to industry on priorities for procurement
decisions.
  -- A more active government role in promoting ``fair access'' for U.K.
companies to overseas markets and in pressing for the elimination of
subsidies to foreign manufacturers.
  -- Considering export potential at an early stage in determining weapon
specifications.
   Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace
Companies (SBAC), ``wholeheartedly'' welcomed the report. Many of its
recommendations echo those of the SBAC, including the call for increased
funding for technology demonstrator programs to preserve critical skills
and reduce procurement costs. He is awaiting with interest the formal
response of the Ministry of Defense to the report which is not expected
until later this year.
   ANTICIPATING THE REPORT, however, a senior Ministry of Defense official
said a more ``systematic'' approach to the long-term viability of the
defense industrial base would be taken in future procurement decisions.
Days before the report was released, Minister for Defense Procurement James
Arbuthnot said ``cost effective collaboration''within a European defense
industry would be pursued with ``maximum vigor.'' But he also noted that
opportunities existed to build upon the U.K. defense industry's ``strong
foothold'' in the U.S.
   The balance between buying off-the-shelf systems, largely from the U.S.,
versus collaborative or national development is to be reexamined in light
of future strategic requirements. A key indicator of how far the government
is willing to go could come shortly when it decides on whether to upgrade
Royal Air Force F3 Tornado fighters, lease used U.S. F-16s or keep patching
them up until the Eurofighter 2000 arrives next century.
   This is a sensitive issue, given the criticism of two previous decisions
in which the U.K. opted to buy U.S.-developed systems--the Lockheed Martin
C-130J and the McDonnell Douglas AH-64--rather than European-developed
alternatives. Issues of preserving critical skills and jobs were key in
those competitions.
   The Ministry of Defense has been evaluating F-16s as a far less costly
alternative to upgrading its Tornado F3 interceptors. But it is
questionable whether the long-term costs would outweigh the short-term
benefits. The Royal Air Force would have to develop an entirely new
logistics system to support the F-16s.

CONFERENCE OUTLINES SPACE `RAMP-UP' PLAN

By:
WILLIAM B. SCOTT

(COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO.)
A classified conference here last month outlined for U.S. theater command
staffs how joint and service space commands would allocate orbital assets
and provide space support if peacetime operations ``ramp up'' to a combat
footing.
   Some discussions are believed to have addressed scenarios that might
arise during the current Bosnian peacekeeping effort, and how military
space assets could be used by U.S. forces. Military officials would not
comment on particulars of the meeting, however.
   THE THIRD ANNUAL Space Support to the Warfighter Conference, cohosted by
the U.S. Space Command (USSC) and the National Reconnaissance Office's
Operational Support Office, attracted about 250 attendees from 40
organizations. The five-day meeting included senior working-level teams
from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff; commander-in-chief (CINC) staffs from
Pacific, Central, Atlantic and European theaters; Air Force, Navy and Army
space commands; national intelligence agencies, and the Defense Information
Systems Agency.
   This year's event included briefings, working groups and demonstrations
or displays related to space ``force enhancement'' topics, such as:
  -- Communications.
  -- Navigation (Global Positioning System).
  -- Space control.
  -- Missile warning and the Theater Event System, with emphasis on
theater-class missile threats.
  -- Intelligence.
  -- New modeling and simulation techniques and tools, such as the Theater
Support Operations Cell (TSOC). Carried by Space Support Teams (SSTs)
during deployments to an exercise, the prototype TSOC is a Silicon
Graphics-based computer system that depicts space data in user-friendly
graphics. For example, it displays orbits of satellite constellations in a
simple format, enabling better visualization of coverage at a particular
time (AW&ST Sept. 18, 1995, p. 36).
   ``TSOC focuses on the implications of space systems, not the
technology,'' said Col. Gary W. Dahlen, vice-director of operations for
USSC. ``The most important purpose of this tool is to improve situational
awareness and battlespace knowledge. Operational commanders are fluent in
what ships, tanks and airplanes do. What hasn't been in their bag of tricks
is knowledge about space systems.''
   Demonstrated for conference attendees this year, TSOC uses commercial
and government-developed software already developed for other purposes.
Service versions now being acquired for Air Force, Navy and Army space
support teams will closely parallel the USSC-developed version.
   Last month's conference also devoted an afternoon to the concept of
global broadcast systems (GBS), a potentially revolutionary method for
communicating data to many troops at once via spacecraft. Analogous to
direct broadcast television, GBS would beam information to specific areas
on a battlefield or theater. Conference attendees were to help develop a
consistent set of requirements for direct broadcast data.
   ``We're trying to understand what the field wants,'' Dahlen said prior
to the conference. ``Should data be `pushed' or `pulled'? Should there be a
'smart hub' that sends data on only some channels? Should there be any
feedback mechanism or status messages? How does [GBS] interact with the
concept of the Global Command and Control System?''
   THE ANNUAL SPACE SUPPORT conference was initiated in 1993 to improve
coordination between the USSC and theater CINCs. To support the needs of
CINC staffs unfamiliar with space-based capabilities, USSC and its service
components set up SSTs dedicated to providing expertise to theater or
``warfighting'' commanders and their staffs. Led by an Air Force or Army
colonel or Navy captain having operational experience, these SSTs now
support 10-15 major CINC exercises annually. Team members spend 140-180
days/year in-theater, helping staffs integrate space capabilities into
exercise planning and execution (AW&ST Dec. 12/19, 1994, p. 24). Now
``space officers'' are assigned permanently to CINC staffs to assist with
day-to-day operations.
   End-of-year space support conferences were established ``to tie up the
loose ends and bring everybody up to date,'' on technologies, issues and
space command activities, Dahlen said. Because attendees consistently have
been ``operators'' from CINC staffs, such as directors of intelligence,
operations and communications, the meetings typically concentrate on
capabilities available now or in the near future.
   ``THE FIRST YEAR we had about 10 people from the unified commands and
their components. The second year we had 10-19, and this year [requests
ranged from] 13 for some commands and up to 25 for others. These forums
seem to be attracting the right people,'' said Chris H. Lugenbill, a member
of the OAO Corp./PRC Inc. contract support team for USSC. About twice as
many people request attendance as can be accommodated at each conference.
   The annual events are hands-on, practical sessions aimed at providing
applicable information that attendees can take back to their units and
apply immediately. Dialogue also has helped the space community better
focus its support efforts.
   ``Our first priority is to understand the field guy's job, and the
second is to broker space solutions to problems the field commanders might
have,'' Dahlen said. ``Many people out in the field thought there was a
mystique about space systems--'behind the green door' [highly classified]
or too technical. We now give them hands-on [experience] such as operating
a GPS 'Slugger,' manipulating multispectral data and using communication
devices.''

BOEING PLANS EELV TESTING

By:
JOSEPH C. ANSELMO

(WASHINGTON)
Boeing is planning an air drop and water retrieval of a propulsion system
containing a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) to demonstrate the viability
of using recoverable components for a new launch vehicle family.
   The air drop will be part of a series of tests the company plans to
perform this summer as part of a $30-million contract it won last August to
validate its concept for the Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle
(EELV) program.
   Similar EELV contracts were won by Alliant Techsystems, Lockheed Martin
and McDonnell Douglas, but only two competitors are slated to survive when
the Air Force awards pre-engineering, manufacturing and development
contracts in December.
   Boeing officials believe their plan to use a recoverable propulsion
module powered by a Block 2 SSME offers the best hope of meeting the EELV
program goal of lowering launch costs by 25-50%. The company recently
signed an agreement with NASA to utilize a spare SSME and engine test
facilities at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.
   Plans call for the SSME to be integrated with a 17-ft.-dia. prototype
propulsion module that is being built for Boeing by Textron. Testing would
begin this summer with several simulated drops from a test stand crane into
a canal at Stennis to verify integration and instrumentation data. That
would be followed by an airplane drop of the propulsion module, possibly
over the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``Basically, we'll be demonstrating the conclusion of the operational
sequence as the propulsion module is decelerated and returned by water
entry,'' said Tim White, Boeing's EELV program manager.
   The propulsion system would then be recovered and the SSME test-fired to
demonstrate its reusability, he said.
   The idea of a recoverable propulsion module is not new to Boeing. The
company conducted 550 tests over 14 years as part of its proposals for the
ill-fated Advanced Launch System and National Launch System programs. But
this summer's tests will mark the first time that live engine hardware has
been used.
   NASA has also offered the use of Stennis' three active test stands to
Boeing's EELV competitors, but only Boeing has signed an agreement to date,
according to Patrick Scheuermann, EELV project manager at the space center.
He said Stennis is eager to offer its facilities for use by industry and
the military.

AMERICAN TECHNOLOGIES INC.

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

AMERICAN TECHNOLOGIES INC. of Fond du Lac, Wis., is marketing mobile
communications services to transportation companies via a system it claims
is faster and cheaper than store-and-forward satellite systems. ATI's
Logitrak system uses Comstar and Spacenet satellites and the Internet to
deliver messages and position data. A truck driver, for example, could send
a message to a dispatcher within 3 sec., according to company president
Larry Bestor. Using the system requires a data terminal and satellite
receiver that currently sells for about $2,500, but unlimited service is
offered at a flat rate of $50 per month.

A MONTAGE OF 12 IMAGES

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

A MONTAGE OF 12 IMAGES from the Soft X-ray Telescope on Japan's Yohkoh
satellite (below) has been created to show the Sun's corona from a peak and
through the waning phase of one 11-year activity cycle. Lockheed Martin
Palo Alto Research Laboratories built the telescope in collaboration with
Japanese scientists. Direct observation of the corona is difficult because
it is much fainter than the star's surface. However, at 2 million K, the
corona is hot enough to emit X-rays, while the 6,000 K surface does not.
But because the X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, a spaceborne
instrument was required. The image on the left was taken Nov. 12, 1991,
during the peak of coronal activity, while the picture on the far right was
made July 27, 1995, shortly before solar minimum.

MARKET FOCUS

By:
ANTHONY L. VELOCCI, JR./NEW YORK

   TRW Inc. is preparing to take action to increase shareholder value
substantially. Among other things, the company is considering repurchasing
a block of its own stock as well as acquisitions.
   Whatever TRW does, some Wall Street analysts are hoping it includes the
sale of the information systems and services unit. The business accounts
for 6% of total sales. While the unit seems to be holding its own, the
analysts believe it could do even better if spun off to the right buyer.
Some market professionals believe such a move would raise TRW's trading
multiple.
   ``The perception is that TRW cares very little about shareholder
value,'' said Jack Blackstock, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette. ``Depending on how aggressively the company addresses this issue,
it's not hard to envision the stock at $100-115 a share.'' While Blackstock
has set a 12-month target price of $90-100, he described the company as a
``table-pounding buy.'' The stock closed at 771/4 last Wednesday.
   Definitely not on the list of options is the sale of TRW's space and
defense business, according to Chairman and CEO Joseph T. Gorman. After
sagging in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is showing net growth. Sales
in 1995 exceeded $3 billion. Not since 1987 has space and defense made such
a relatively large contribution to TRW's coffers. In the first nine months
of 1995, the operation logged $3.6 billion in new contracts. Firm backlog
stands at a record $4.6 billion.
   ``I was among the analysts who sat around in disbelief back in 1992 when
Gorman told us the space and defense business would show net growth
starting in the second half of the 1990s, and it's turning out that he was
right,'' Blackstock said. ``What that tells me is that he's a lot better
than people give him credit for.''
   As expected, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. recently
won their court battle over the 1991 cancellation of the U.S. Navy's A-12
attack aircraft. A federal judge ruled the program was killed for
convenience, not default as the government contended. Now, one outstanding
issue is how much of the $2 billion-plus in claims the contractors will
collect. The other issue is whether the government will appeal.
   Some aerospace analysts believe the anticipated win already is reflected
in the companies' stock prices. ``This did not come as a surprise, although
it was a big step toward clearing the air,'' Merrill Lynch analyst Byron
Callan said. ``Now the question is not whether they'll get something but
when and how much.'' What has not been factored into the stock prices is
how a settlement could enhance earnings power, Callan added.
   ``I would be surprised if there is no attempt to seek damages over and
above the claims already pending,'' JSA Research analyst Paul Nisbet noted.
``If that happens, there could be two paydays.'' Executives of both
companies have cited possible damage to their concerns' reputations from
government accusations.
   Callan and Nisbet think the stock prices could increase slightly on the
reality of the settlement, depending on size and timing. If the companies
do collect, McDonnell Douglas is expected to use the windfall to pay down
debt and add to its war chest for acquisitions. General Dynamics, which is
virtually debt-free and has about $1 billion in cash, is expected to use
all of the money for acquisitions.

APACHE LONGBOW TO USE VAPOR CYCLE COOLING

By:
BRUCE D. NORDWALL

(WASHINGTON)
A cooling system developed by Fairchild Controls using refrigerant and an
unusual compressor design is gaining applications to cool military avionics
that require high output and low weight.
   The vapor cycle system has an efficiency 10-20% greater than an air
cycle system, according to Drew Bogus, director for business development at
Fairchild Controls. The electrically powered design avoids the degradations
in aircraft performance sometimes caused by large bleed air extraction to
power the alternative--a conventional air-cycle environmental control
system. Still, the system puts an electrical load on the engine drawing 36
Kva. for maximum cooling in the latest application.
   That utilization uses two independent systems to cool the Apache Longbow
mission avionics. One cools the forward avionics bay and gunner, and the
other cools the aft avionics and pilot. First flight for the Apache Longbow
installation was late September, about 15 months after contract award.
Production deliveries could begin in October, Bogus said.
   The positive displacement compressor has an unusual helical-rotor
design. Twin counter-rotating screws give the heli-rotor higher compression
efficiency, in a small housing, than other compressor designs, according to
the company. The compressors are currently produced in two sizes, a 54-mm.
diameter and a 30-mm. The smaller of the rolling piston compressors has
cooling capacities between 2 and 4.5 kW., depending on the applications.
   The small rotors turn at about 11,000 rpm., a much lower speed than air
cycle machines, because the thermodynamic properties of their refrigerant
require less mass through the compressor to get the same cooling capacity.
The closed-loop vapor cycle system uses HFC-134a, the environmentally
friendly refrigerant now standard for most automotive air conditioners.
Company officials say the lower speed makes the system inherently more
reliable with a current MTBF (mean time between failure) of 1,500 hr. and a
goal of 2,000 hr. Vapor cycle systems are also quieter, producing about 50%
less noise, according to Bogus. They can be designed to run at multiple
speeds, high for rapid cooling, low for standard use.
   The increasing density of military avionics is creating the need for
cooling solutions such as this vapor cycle system and liquid flow-through
cooling in the U.S. Air Force's new F-22 and the Army's AH-66 Comanche
helicopter. But the technology is far from new. Fairchild Controls' vapor
cycle systems have been used for years in the Pave tack airborne targeting
and laser designation system for F-111s and for cooling VIP helicopters.

MITSUBISHI INTRODUCES AIRBORNE IR IMAGER

(WASHINGTON)
Mitsubishi's new IR-G600 high-resolution thermal imager is designed for
aircraft/unmanned aerial vehicles. The 15-lb. unit has a built-in Stirling
cycle cooler, measures 7 X 8 X 8 in., has a mean time between failure
(MTBF) of over 8,000 hr., and sells for about $90,000. The 512 X 512
element platinum silicide focal plane array, sensitive to changes of 0.08C,
operates in the 1.2-5.9 micron band.

MAKE ECONOMICS THE BASIS OF AVIATION PACTS

The best way for the U.S. to secure the strongest possible international
aviation agreements is for our negotiators to make decisions based on
economic analysis with the goal of maximizing benefits for the U.S.
economy. International aviation decisions should turn on what is best for
our country, not which carriers can generate the most political support. In
1995, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena did an excellent job in this
regard. U.S. passenger and cargo carriers are capitalizing on a plethora of
new international opportunities, while the increased competition is
bringing consumers lower air fares, reduced shipping costs and greater
choices. . . .
   Looking ahead to 1996 . . . we face a number of challenges, most notably
aviation policy with Japan and the U.K. Also, we have a golden opportunity
to obtain an ``open skies'' agreement with Germany that would be a catalyst
for further liberation of European air service opportunities. . . .
   The major impediment to liberalizing aviation relations with Japan is
the high operating cost of Japanese carriers, due in large part to Japan's
tightly regulated airline industry. Until Japan permits its carriers to
become more competitive, there will be enormous pressure within the country
to continue to protect its air service market.
   Japan, along with other Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation members
including the U.S., recently committed to work toward free and open trade
between all member nations. The so-called Bogor Declaration has the
potential to have a major impact on U.S./Japan aviation relations.
   ONE THING, HOWEVER, IS CERTAIN: The continued refusal of Japan to abide
by the terms of U.S./Japan bilateral concerning beyond rights guaranteed to
several of our carriers undoubtedly will complicate aviation relations
between our two countries. Currently, Japan is refusing to honor United
Airlines' right to provide service between Osaka and Seoul. FedEx is being
wrongfully denied the right to provide service between Japan and China.
Beyond rights from Japan are absolutely essential if U.S. carriers are to
fully participate in the booming Asia-Pacific market. . . .
   Of all our international aviation agreements, the most restrictive and
therefore our most anti-consumer bilateral is the so-called Bermuda 2 pact.
Approximately 58% of the passenger traffic between the U.S. and U.K. is
carried on British airlines. In 1984-85, British carriers improved their
market share vis-a-vis U.S. airlines by 21%. During the same period, a
majority of carriers from other European Community countries lost market
share. These statistics are particularly remarkable when one considers that
operating costs of European carriers are higher than those of U.S.
airlines...
   THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS ENTHUSIASTIC about promptly securing an open
skies agreement with the U.S. An open skies agreement with Germany
immediately would produce new air service opportunities for our carriers
between the U.S. and Germany. Equally important, German airports would
provide well-situated gateways for our carriers to serve points beyond
Germany such as the Middle East and the booming Asia-Pacific market.
   An open skies agreement with Germany--in combination with liberalized
air service agreements we secured with the Netherlands in 1992 and nine
other European countries earlier this year--would mean nearly half of all
passengers traveling between the U.S. and Europe would be flying to or from
European countries with open skies regimes. The recent European Commission
report on E.C./U.S. aviation relations astutely concluded that other
European countries that resist liberalization ``will either have to follow
the open skies policy, or risk being left behind in the competition and in
market share.''
   BETWEEN 1992 AND 1994, total passenger traffic between the U.S. and the
Netherlands grew an astounding 56%. During the same period, total passenger
traffic between the U.S. and U.K. grew just 7.5%. What does this
illustrate? It demonstrates that Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is drawing
passenger traffic originating in the U.S. away from U.K. airports,
particularly London Heathrow.
   The international aviation challenges we face in 1996 make it imperative
that our negotiators continue to make decisions based on economic analysis
with the goal of maximizing benefits for the U.S. economy. This was a
successful formula in our 1995 international aviation negotiations. In
1996, it is critical we build on the lesson we learned during the past
year.

About the Author(s):

Larry Pressler (R.-S.D.) chairs the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce,
Science and Transportation. In a speech on the Senate floor just before the
holidays, he said 1996 will be a critical year for the U.S. in
international aviation negotiations. And, he outlined his vision of
strategies the nation should pursue. Excerpts from his speech follow:
