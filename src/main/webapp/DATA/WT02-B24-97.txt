<h2>Rights and Responsibilities of Parents of Children with
Disabilities</h2>

<h3>What are your rights, as a parent, in the special education
process?</h3>

<p>Public Law 101-476 (IDEA) clearly defines the rights of children
with disabilities and their parents. A fundamental provision of the
law is the right of parents to participate in the educational
decision-making process. This includes the right to:
<ul>

<li>Free appropriate public education for your child. Free
     means at no cost to you as parents. Appropriate means meeting
     the unique educational needs of your child.

<li>Be notified whenever the school wishes to evaluate your
     child, wants to change your child's educational placement, or
     refuses your request for an evaluation or a change in
     placement.

<li>Initiate an evaluation if you think your child needs special
     education or related services.

<li>Informed consent. Informed consent means you understand and
     agree in writing to the evaluation and educational program
     decisions for your child.  Your consent is voluntary and may
     be withdrawn at any time.

<li>Obtain an independent evaluation if you disagree with the
     outcome of the school's evaluation.

<li>Request a reevaluation if you suspect your child's present
     educational placement is no longer appropriate. The school
     must reevaluate your child at least every 3 years, but your
     child's educational program must be reviewed at least once
     during each calendar year.

<li>Have your child tested in the language he or she knows best.
     For example, if your child's primary language is Spanish, this
     is the language in which he or she must be tested. Also,
     students who are deaf have the right to an interpreter during
     the testing.

<li>Review all of your child's records. You may obtain copies of
     these records, but the school may charge you a reasonable fee
     for making copies. Only you, as parents, and those persons
     directly involved in the education of your child will be
     permitted access to personal records. If you feel that any of
     the information in your child's records is inaccurate or
     misleading or violates the privacy or other rights of your
     child, you may request that the information be changed. If the
     school refuses your request, you then have the right to
     request a hearing in order to challenge the questionable
     information in your child's records.

<li>Be fully informed by the school of all rights that are
     provided to you under the law.

<li>Participate in the development of your child's
     individualized education program (IEP), or, in the case of a
     child under school age, the development of an Individualized
     Family Service Plan (IFSP). The school must make every
     possible effort to notify you of the IEP or IFSP meeting and
     then arrange it at a time and a place that is convenient for
     you. Remember, your child's IEP or IFSP cannot be implemented
     without your written consent.

<li>Have your child educated in the least restrictive school
     setting possible. Every effort should be made to develop an
     educational program that will provide the greatest amount of
     contact with children who are not disabled.

<li>Request a due process hearing to resolve differences with
     the school that could not be resolved informally.
</ul>
<p><b>
What are your responsibilities, as a parent, in the special
Education process?</b>
<p>
Parental responsibilities to ensure that a child's rights are being
protected are less clearly defined than are parental rights. These
responsibilities vary considerably depending on the nature of the
child's disabling condition and other factors.  In accepting these
responsibilities, some of the following suggestions may be helpful:
<ul>
<li>
Develop a partnership with the school or agency. You are now
     an important member of the team. Share relevant information
     about your child's education and development. Your
     observations and suggestions can be a valuable resource to aid
     your child's progress.

<li>Ask for clarification of any aspect of the program that is
     unclear to you. Educational and medical terms can be
     confusing, so do not hesitate to ask. 

<li>Make sure you understand the program specified on the IEP or
     IFSP before agreeing to it or signing it. Ask yourself if what
     is planned corresponds with your knowledge of your child's
     needs.

<li>Make sure your child is included in the regular school
     activities program. Do not forget nonacademic areas such as
     lunch and recess and other areas such as art, music, and
     physical education.

<li>Learn as much as you can about your rights and the rights of
     your child. Ask the school to explain these rights as well as
     the policies and regulations in effect in your district and
     state before you agree to a special education program for your
     child.

<li>Monitor your child's progress. If your child is not
     progressing, discuss it with the teacher and determine whether
     the program should be modified. As a parent, you can initiate
     changes in your child's educational program.

<li>Discuss with the school or agency any problems that may
     occur with your child's assessment, placement, or educational
     program. It is best to try to resolve these problems directly
     with the agency, school, or district. In some situations, you
     may be uncertain as to which direction you should take to
     resolve a problem. Most states have protection and advocacy
     agencies that can provide you with the guidance you need to
     pursue your case.
<li>Keep records. There may be many questions and comments about
     your child that you will want to discuss, as well as meetings
     and phone conversations you will want to remember. It is easy
     to forget information useful to your child's development and
     education if it is not written down.
<li>Join a parent organization. In addition to the opportunity
     to share knowledge, experiences, and support, a parent group
     can be an effective force on behalf of your child. Many times
     parents find that as a group they have the power to bring
     about needed changes to strengthen and broaden special
     services.
</ul>

<h3>As the parent of a child with a disability, what can you offer the
IEP or IFSP process?</h3>
<p>
In the final analysis, parents of children with disabilities should
be involved in the process as much as they want to be and as much
as they can be. Varying degrees of involvement are possible. The
following are suggestions for ways that parents can become
involved:
<ul>
<li>Before attending an IEP or IFSP meeting, make a list of
     things you want your child to learn. Discuss any differences
     between your list and the school's or agency's list. Take
     notes about aspects of your child's behavior that could
     interfere with the learning process. Describe the methods you
     have found to be successful in dealing with these behaviors.
<li>
    Bring any information the school or agency may not already
     have to the IEP or IFSP meeting. Examples include copies of
     medical records, past school records, or test or medical
     evaluation results. Remember, reports do not say all there is
     to say about a child. You can add real-life examples to 
     demonstrate your child's ability in certain areas. 
<li>
    Find out what related services are being provided. Besides
    your child's teacher, many other specialists and professionals
    may have contact with your child through provision of related
    services. Ask each professional to describe the kind of
    service he or she will be providing and what growth you might
    expect to see as a result of these services.
<li>
    Ask what you can do at home to support the program. Many
    skills the child learns at school can also be used at home.
    Ask to meet with the teacher when your child is learning a new
    skill that could be practiced at home. 
<li>
    Make sure the goals and objectives on the IEP or IFSP are
    specific. This will ensure that everyone teaching your child
    is working toward the same goals.  Ask questions to make sure
    that you understand and agree with each of the goals and
    objectives before signing the IEP or IFSP. 
<li>
    Periodically, ask for a report on your child's progress.
    After the meeting is over, your job as a parent is not
    finished. You should follow your child's progress throughout
    the year.
<li>
    Regard your child's education as a cooperative effort. If at
     any point you and the school cannot reach an agreement over
     your child's educational and developmental needs, ask to have
     another meeting. This would allow time for you and the school
     or agency to gather more information and data. If after a
     second meeting there is still a conflict over your child's
     program, you should ask for a state mediator or a due process
     hearing.
</ul>

<h3>
What resources are available to help you?</h3>
<p>
Local and state education agencies have information to help guide
you through the special education process. Since the specific
criteria and procedures used by school districts vary, it is
important to familiarize yourself with the information they
provide. You will find your local director of special education and
his or her staff helpful in accessing such information and guiding
you through the process. 
<p>
Additional resources are available from national organizations.
Some of them will also be able to direct you to local and state
chapters that can provide more locally based support. Almost all of
the states now have federally supported parent information and
training centers. Any of the contacts cited here may be able to
help you locate such a center in your state:
