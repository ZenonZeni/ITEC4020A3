<b>ABSTRACT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The most recent design of the ITER (International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor) tokamak divertor and first wall utilizes a variety of
materials, such as beryllium, carbon, and tungsten.<sup>1,2</sup> Under plasma
operation, these materials will be eroded and redeposited resulting in
plasma-facing surfaces consisting of complex materials comprised of all three
components, hydrides, and other related compounds. Therefore, the physical
properties of such mixed materials are of great interest for ITER.  In this
report, we present the results of a literature search for data on the physical
properties of binary mixtures of beryllium, carbon, and tungsten. This search
was done using the MELVYL INSPEC database. The results of the search including
author list, titles, and abstracts of the extracted articles are compiled here.
Further, we present a compilation of journal citations on beryllium materials
experiments and mixed materials experiments in tokamaks.<p>

<b></b><p>
<b></b>	It is well known that the surface material of the inner walls and of
plasma-facing components in fusion experiments is a mixed material, often
called "tokamakium" (See Chapter 2). This surface layer is the result of
material transport due to sputter-erosion, melting, evaporation, etc..
Moreover, the recent design of the ITER tokamak divertor includes three
different materials, i.e., beryllium, carbon and tungsten.<sup>1,2</sup><p>
	To respond to the urgent need for information about the properties of mixed
surface-layer materials, a literature search has been performed using the
MELVYL INSPEC database. This database has 1,396,046 citations indexed by the
Institution of Electrical Engineers from over 4000 journals and other
publications in physics, electronics, and computing. We examined the database
for papers on mixed materials published between 1/1/69 and 9/25/95. Because we
were interested in the mixed materials of beryllium, carbon, and tungsten, the
key words, such as "beryllium, carbon", "beryllium, tungsten", and "carbon,
tungsten" were used. The following table shows the number of papers that have
been found using these commands.<p>

The numbers indicate that tungsten and carbon are widely used materials in the
field of thin film. We examined the titles and abstracts of these papers and
selected those having relevant data. In the following report, we have
classified these papers according to subject area and listed the bibliographic

Abstract: Thermal desorption measurements have been made on high purity
beryllium samples loaded with deuterium by thermal absorption in 13.3 kPa of
D/sub 2/ gas at 773 K. The saturation content of deuterium in the Be was
determined to be 6.3 appm. Rutherford backscattering analysis indicated that
the surface oxide grew significantly during the experiments, even in a vacuum
of &lt;10/sup -5/ Pa. In order to determine deuterium solubility in BeO, a
sample was oxidised in air for 16 h at 1073 K prior to deuterium loading. The
deuterium content was estimated by /sup 3/He-D nuclear reaction analysis as
approximately 200 appm. From attempts to fit previously published data using
diffusion models, it is concluded that surface recombination is unlikely to be
an important factor, whereas surface oxide and trapping effects significantly
delay the release of deuterium from Be and BeO.<p>

Abstract: Deuterium thermal absorption and desorption experiments were
conducted in high-purity Be, BeO and Be/sub 2/C samples. Ion-beam analysis was
used to measure the surface contamination and near-surface deuterium
concentration (up to depths of 500 nm). For bulk BeO the deuterium solubility
is small, with S approximately=10/sup 18/ exp(-0.8 eV/kT) at/m/sup 3/(Pa)/sup
1/2/, possibly indicative of the formation of hydroxide bonds; the diffusivity
is &gt;or=7*10/sup -5/ exp(-2.1 eV/kT) m/sup 2//s. In deliberately corroded Be
samples the deuterium surface concentration was about 0.02 at.% where there was
little or no carbon contamination, and up to 1.6 at.% when the carbon and
oxygen contents were similar. This implies the presence of large concentrations
of trapped deuterium at or near the surface. The approximate solubility of bulk
Be/sub 2/C samples was estimated as 3.4*10/sup 27/exp(-0.58 eV/kT) at/m/sup
3/(Pa)/sup 1/2/. The solubility for deuterium in bulk Be was found to be
7*10/sup 27/exp(-1.0 eV/kT) at/m/sup 3/(Pa)1/2 and the bulk diffusivity is
8*10/sup -9/ exp(-0.36 eV/kT) m/sup 2//s.<p>

Abstract: Results of measurements of sticking coefficients of nitrogen,
hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide on beryllium thick films at room
temperature are described. Beryllium was vapor deposited onto glass substrates
and the sticking coefficient of the impinging gas molecules was measured as a
function of quantity adsorbed. No adsorption was observed with either nitrogen
or hydrogen. A sticking coefficient of 0.4 for oxygen was measured with a total
coverage of 8.4*10/sup 14/ molecules/cm/sup 2/. Carbon monoxide displayed some
pressure dependence and the initial sticking coefficient was found to be
roughly proportional to the square root of the pressure. In the 10/sup -8/ Torr
range a sticking coefficient of 0.1 was measured with a total coverage of
4.0*10/sup 13/ molecules/cm/sup 2/; in the 10/sup -7/ Torr range a sticking
coefficient of 0.5 was measured with a total coverage of 2.4*10/sup 14/

Abstract: The specific electrical resistances of beryllium borides increases
regularly with increasing relative content of boron from values characteristic
of metallic conductors in the lower borides, to values characteristic of
insulators in the higher borides. The structure and electrophysical properties
of the lower borides of beryllium are determined by the pattern of beryllium
bonds, basically of the metallic type. The structure and electrophysical
properties of the higher borides of beryllium are determined by the pattern of
the boron bonds of the covalent type. Between the higher- energy electron
configurations of beryllium and the electron configurations of boron there is
an energy gap which causes the insulating properties. The higher beryllium
borocarbide, bec/sub 2/b/sub 12/, is close to b/sub 4/c in structure, hardness
and electrical properties. The lower beryllium borocarbide bec/sub 2/b2 has
semi-metallic properties.<p>

at 1273, 1373 and 1473 degrees K were 26.5, 0.154 and 0.264 resp. The inherent

Abstract: Attempts, with independent estimates, to resolve the existing
discrepancies and identify with greater confidence the mechanism of diffusion
of C in Be. For this purpose the authors have carried out additional
measurements of the dependences of the dislocation damping on the amplitude of
deformation and the temperature for samples of powdered and cast Be, containing
0.1 wt.% each of Fe and C as the main impurities. The experimental results are
plotted as ln tan alpha vs. T/sup -1/ in accordance with the theory of
dislocation damping. On the basis of an analysis of the interaction of
dislocations with point defects, it is established that, upon heating to 470K,
thermal unpinning of dislocations takes place in Be, and, conversely, at higher
temperatures (470-740K), dislocations become effectively pinned by dissolved
impurities.\<p>

Abstract: Determines the kinetics of Be/sub 2/C formation. An interfacial

cause the growth of the carbide layer. The growth is apparently controlled by
the diffusion of Be in the carbide.<p>

Abstract: Enhanced diffusion of carbon is observed to be produced during
annealing of silicon at 900 degrees C under conditions of surface oxidation and
phosphorus in-diffusion. Silicon containing high concentrations of carbon (
approximately 9*10/sup 17//cm/sup 3/ substitutional) and varying levels of
interstitial oxygen and differing defect concentrations has been studied.
Diffusion coefficient enhancement over the value found for an anneal in an
inert ambient is by a factor of three during oxidation and a factor of forty
with phosphorus in-diffusion. Carbon accumulation takes place in a region
0.3-0.5 microns from the sample surface only under conditions of phosphorus
in-diffusion and is attributed to carbon precipitation. A model that assumes
interactions between silicon self-interstitials and the carbon can explain both
the enhanced diffusion and the carbon accumulation.<p>

Abstract: Diffusion of carbon into silicon was investigated between 1176 K and
1658 K by the radiotracer technique using precision grinding for serial
sectioning. Gaussian- or erfc-type penetration profiles were observed,
depending on the applied /sup 14/C-source technique. Diffusion coefficients
determined on virtually defect-free material, CZ wafers containing mainly
stacking faults and highly dislocated crystals agree within the experimental
accuracy. The data obey an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of
3.04 eV and a pre-exponential factor of 0.95.10/sup -4/ m/sup 2/s/sup -1/. The
results are discussed in terms of diffusion via interstitial-substitutional

Abstract: A compilation of physical sputtering under deuterium bombardment is

authors performed carbon ion bombardment at a grazing angle. They also
investigated the radiation enhanced sublimation of these materials in
experiments at high temperatures up to 1850 K. Radiation-enhanced sublimation
can be avoided in boron carbide up to 1700 K under deuterium ion bombardment,
but not under carbon ion bombardment. This is interpreted as an effect of
material modification of the surface layer due to carbon enrichment.<p>

Abstract: Adsorption of beryllium on (110), (111) and (211) planes of
single-crystal of tungsten was studied using a probe-hole field electron
microscope (FEM). The dependence of the work function on the time of deposition
was measured for these planes. The average work function was determined as
well. On the (110) plane the work function varies regularly, i.e. it decreases
at low coverage, passes through minimum and saturates for a thick layer at the
value of 4.1 eV, which is that for bulk beryllium. On (111) and (211) planes
the work function increases for low coverage and saturates for thicker layer at
very high values which are 5.3 eV and 6 eV, respectively. The irregular
behaviour has to be connected with loose structure of these planes and small
atomic radius of beryllium.<p>

Abstract: The work function changes induced by the adsorption of beryllium on

initial stage of the adsorption reaching a local maximum at the coverage of 1/2
and saturates at approximately 3 monolayers. Starting from 1/2 of the beryllium
monolayer an additional peak appears in the spectrum of back-scattered
electrons ascribed as due to the excitation of plasma oscillations. Its energy
loss of 17.6 eV is distinctly higher than that corresponding to the surface
plasmon of bulk beryllium. The explanation of the observed phenomena is
proposed.<p>

plasmons have been excited within the Be adlayer at coverages less than one

distinctly different. An explanation of observed phenomena is proposed.<p>

Abstract: Field emission energy distributions (FEED) have been measured for the

A temperature dependence of the normalized half-width, Delta /d, of FEED peaks
changed significantly due to beryllium adsorption; and the curve, Delta /d vs
p, for the Be/W adsorption system was identical in character to the calculated
curve based on the free electron (FE) model in contrast to the curve for the
clean tungsten surface. In the last part of this paper Gadzuk's theory of the
resonance-tunneling effect is applied to the beryllium atom on tungsten.
Experimental and theoretical curves of the enhancement factor R as a function
of energy have been discussed.<p>

Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), work
function change ( Delta phi ) measurements and thermal desorption spectroscopy
(TDS). Measurements were made at room temperature before and after annealing of
the adsorbed layer. The work function change depends on the thermal history of
the sample and can be explained in terms of a temperature-dependent adsorption
process involving double layer formation.<p>

Abstract: Field-emission microscope observations of beryllium crystallites on
tungsten at temperatures from 400 to 850K showed that crystallites generally
occupied atomically rough regions around (001), (112) and (011) planes. The
ultimate size of a crystallite was limited by the extent of the favourable area
around its position on the substrate. The rate of beryllium deposition was
about 4 layers per minute. The average values of work function of bulk
beryllium are between 3.9 eV and 4.1 eV.<p>

Abstract: The growth mode, work function, thermal desorption and structure of
Be films up to several layers in thickness on a W(110) surface are
investigated. At room temperature layer-by-layer growth occurs, at least up to
3 layers. Thick films show a complex growth and annealing behavior. Within the
first layer the bonding to the substrate is only slightly ionic, the bonding
between the adatoms probably at least in part via indirect electronic
interactions. Filling of the first layer proceeds by a sequence of
discontinuous structural transformations combined with changes of the
electronic properties of the deposit and of the adsorbate-substrate binding
forces.

Abstract: Electron beam induced carbon deposition on a polycrystalline tungsten
ribbon has been examined by Auger electron spectroscopy, (AES). Deposition
occurs from carbon monoxide, through dissociation of weakly held alpha-CO, and
also from carbon dioxide and methane. In each case the saturation coverage is
3.0-3.3*10/sup 15/ atoms cm/sup -2/, approaching the monolayer of the basal
plane of graphite. The Auger line shape indicates that the deposited layer is
graphitic in nature and incorporation of carbon into the graphite layer is
suggested to be rate determining.<p>

Abstract: Layered synthetic microstructures composed of alternate layers of
carbon and tungsten (prepared by triode sputtering) are analysed by Auger
electron spectroscopy. A superficial pollution by silica is observed. In the
multilayer, an in-depth contamination by oxygen is detected: a preferential
oxidation of tungsten relative to carbon is observed. The Auger depth profile
presents periodic and asymmetrical C and W waves. As LSM's were not annealed
this result is related purely to an effect of sputtering. A theoretical
approach based on the overlap of Gaussian distributions is proposed and agrees
fairly well with the experimental data.<p>

Abstract: Carbon coatings on the first wall and the shielding of the first wall
by graphite tiles effectively improve plasma parameters by reducing radiation
losses in the plasma. In this experiment, a fast in-situ coating method of low
atomic number materials by a compact vacuum-arc deposition gun was developed.
This method is useful for in-situ carbon coating on the first wall as well as
for in-situ regeneration of coatings on graphite tiles damaged through plasma
wall interactions or by high heat loads from the plasma. Thick carbon and
carbon-carbon coatings of up to the thickness of 310 mu m were made on
molybdenum or tungsten by this deposition gun. X-ray diffraction analysis
indicates that the degree of disorder in the crystal structure of the coating
films deposited in argon is larger than that deposited in hydrogen. Many
diffraction peaks associated with Mo/sub 2/C, WC and W/sub 2/C were observed in
the X-ray diffraction. These peaks show that the interdiffusion between the
deposited film and the substrate increased the adhesive strength of the
deposited film to the substrate.<p>

Abstract: Tungsten-carbon coatings have been deposited on stainless steel
substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering in Ar-CH/sub 4/ mixtures. The
composition of coatings was determined by electron microprobe analyses. Only
the cubic alpha -W phase with an expanded lattice parameter was detected by
X-ray diffraction in the W-C coatings containing less than 25 at.% of carbon.
Since the lattice dilatation of the alpha -W phase increased with increasing
carbon content these coatings were assumed to be tungsten-carbon solid
solutions. The dilatation of the W crystal lattice and Vickers hardness of the
solid-solution-type W-C coatings were measured as functions of the carbon
concentration. A lattice dilatation-microhardness relationship was
established.<p>

Abstract: Eruptions that occur on tungsten electrodes after repeated 35-A arcs
of 1.44-msec duration have been studied with a scanning Auger microprobe and
found to contain high concentrations (20-30 at.%) of carbon. This is much
greater than the average carbon concentration in the tungsten and is in the
vicinity of the W-W/sub 2/C eutectic at 25 at.%. Further evidence that the
eruptions are rich in W/sub 2/C comes from their solubility in hot HNO/sub 3/.
Therefore it appears that carbon progressively segregates in the arc spots due
to its low solid solubility in tungsten and the resultant lowering of the
melting point is responsible for the eruptions.<p>

Abstract: The refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dissolve C, N, and O by
forming interstitial solid solutions. The concentration of these components can
be increased or decreased by annealing treatments, depending on the partial
pressure of gases such as N/sub 2/, O/sub 2/, H/sub 2/O, CH/sub 4/, or CO and
on the temperature of the specimen. New results in binary and ternary systems
combined with those obtained in the last few years provide most of the data
needed for the thermochemical analysis of the solid solution phases and for the
establishment of p-T-c phase diagrams. The mechanisms of the gas-metal
reactions and the general feature of the constitution diagrams are similar for
all refractory metals. However, marked differences exist between group Va
metals niobium and tantalum and group VIa metals molybdenum and tungsten in the
absolute values and temperature dependence of the equilibrium pressure of
gaseous species and therefore also in the amount of gas absorbed. The data now
available for the estimation of the final content of interstitials in solid
solution after annealing treatments are compiled and discussed.<p>

Coadsorption studies by Auger electron spectroscopy: Nitrogen with oxygen and

Surface Science, Jan. 1977, vol.62, (no.1):93-105.<p>
Pub type:  Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: Coadsorption experiments on polycrystalline tungsten showed that the
initial sticking probability and the total uptake of oxygen are unaffected by
the prior adsorption of 6.5*10/sup 14/ atoms cm/sup -2/ of nitrogen. Desorption
spectra revealed that nitrogen is not displaced in the process and that the
adsorption energy for nitrogen is relatively unaffected by the presence of
coadsorbed oxygen. AES peak-to-peak height intensities were absolutely
calibrated as a function of nitrogen coverage on W (100), and compared with
previous calibrations for C and O. It was found that during oxygen adsorption
on a nitrogen-saturated surface both the W and the N Auger signals were
attenuated. Flash desorption again shows that nitrogen is not displaced from W
(100), and it is concluded from the degree of attenuation of the N Auger signal
that the N adatoms are buried approximately 3.6 AA beneath a pseudomorphic
layer of tungsten oxide. AA structural model is proposed which is consistent
with the results. The growth of a carbon layer from electron beam interaction
with adsorbed CO was also examined on a N-presaturated W (100) surface, and a
similar model proposed to explain the results.<p>

boundaries and subboundaries. Methods of purifying the metals of C, O/sub 2/
and N/sub 2/ are considered-thermal cycling in a medium with a low oxygen
content, electron-beam zone refining and the plasma-arc method.

Abstract: The carburized surface of W(001) has been of interest because of the
moderating effect of the carbon on the catalytic properties of the W surface.
The authors have studied the carburized surface of W(001) formed by
dissociative adsorption of ethylene using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES),
low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and alkali ion scattering. The
previously published sequence of LEED patterns and associated coverages were
reproduced. The intensity of the Li/sup +//C single scattering intensity was
monitored as a function of exposure for various ion incident angles and
correlated to the C/W Auger intensity ratio. Analysis of this data showed that
C adsorbed above the first W layer at all coverages, including that associated
with a (5*1) LEED pattern generated by adsorption at 1500 K. The structure has
been obtained by analysis of the incident angle dependence of the Li/sup +/ on
W single scattering intensity for the clean and carbon covered surfaces. No
major reconstruction of the carburized surface occurs, even for the (5*1). The
prominent C single scattering peak, the incident angle dependence and K/sup +/
multiple scattering features indicate that the C resides at or near the
four-fold hollows at all coverages. Analysis of the incident angle associated
with shadowing of W by C demonstrates that the C atoms are 0.5 AA above the
plane of the first layer W. The LEED (5*1) pattern is attributed to ordering in
the C overlayer and a possible small amplitude periodic strain induced in the
first layer W by the C.<p>

Abstract: The diffusion coefficients of the radioactive tracer, carbon-14, in
randomly-oriented single crystals of tungsten and tungsten-rhenium alloys (3.9
at.% Re, 6.8 at.%Re) have been measured over the temperature range 1500 degrees
-1800 degrees C. Experimentally, a thin carbide layer, formed on one face of
the sample by a reaction with carbon-14 (fine powder, 10 mc/mM), provided the
source of carbon throughout the diffusion anneal. Since a non-equilibrium
redistribution of carbon occurred during cooling, the concentration profile
within 60 mu m of the interface, measured at room temperature, was different
from that established during the diffusion anneal. Therefore, a computer
iteration technique was used to calculate a best-fit value for D, the diffusion
coefficient, from the measured values of the activity, A(x); the distance from
the carbide-solid solution interface, x; the annealing time, t, and from the
estimated values of the activity at the interface, A/sub L/. In all diffusion
samples, a zone of carbon depletion adjacent to the interface was observed as a
result of carbon segregation to the interface. The extent of the depleted zone
is a function of cooling rate.<p>

according to the parabolic law. The activation energy of the surface diffusion
was measured for three segments in two crystallographic directions: (011) to
(001) and (211) to (001). For a given direction the value of the activation
energy depends on the character of the substrate surface. Also it was observed
that the activation energy decreases with the increase of the initial dose of
carbon. Diffusion constants D/sub 0/ were estimated.<p>

Abstract: For a great number of ion-target combinations similarities in low
energy sputtering have been found. Near the threshold energy for sputtering
E/sub th/ the energy dependence of the sputtering yield can be written as
S=Y(E/E/sub th/)/sup 1/4/(1-E/sub th//E)/sup 7/2/. E/sub th/ and Y depend only
on the surface binding energy E/sub B/ and the ion-target atom mass ratio.
Using this relation the energy dependence of the sputtering yield of B/sub 4/C,
SiC, TiC, TaC, WC is compared with the yields from C, Si, Ti, Ta, W, for H, D
and He in the energy range of 50 eV to 8 keV. A strong similarity of the energy
dependence, i.e. E/sub th/ and Y, can be found between the carbide and the
heavier component of the compound. This leads to the assumption that the target
surface is depleted of the light component due to preferential sputtering and
the sputtering process is dominated by the heavy component.<p>

Abstract: Sputtering yields of prospective materials for the first wall in
fusion devices such as TiC, SiC, C, W, and stainless steel with typical
impurity ions as O/sup +/ and C/sup +/ have been measured in the
fusion-relevant energy range from 100 eV to 10 keV. In the case of
oxygen-bombardment sputtering is reduced compared to sputtering with noble gas
ions of similar atomic masses for all materials investigated but graphite. In
the case of C/sup +/-bombardment a collection of carbon was observed.<p>

Abstract: The influence of near-surface impurities on the enhanced sputtering
of graphite near 600 degrees C and above 1000 degrees C has been investigated
under various doping conditions. The chemical sputtering yield of methane
molecules for 2 keV D/sup +/ ions on graphite at 600 degrees C has been
determined for several coverages of Si, Fe, Ni, Ti, Mo, and Au. Graphite
samples were pre-deposited with approximately 500 AA of a given impurity, and
weight loss was monitored in-situ using a vacuum balance while sputtering
through the deposited layer. Small accounts of impurities remaining on the
surface after prolonged sputtering reduced chemical erosion by 30-50%. The
radiation-enhanced sublimation of graphite observed for energetic ion
bombardment above 1000 degrees C was investigated during 50 keV Ar sputtering
and simultaneous Ti evaporation. For very low surface concentrations of Ti,
graphite sputtering increased while for concentrations above 10 at.% the yields
were significantly reduced. A graphite sample containing 4 at.% bulk Si was
also investigated and showed greatly reduced chemical erosion at 600 degrees C
but no reduction in radiation-enhanced sublimation at 1500 degrees C due to
surface enrichment and depletion of Si for the low- and high-temperature
irradiation, respectively.<p>

Abstract: The sputter-erosion of molybdenum and tungsten due to the bombardment
with 7 keV Ar/sup +/, Ne/sup +/ and CO/sup +/ ions and that with 7 keV Ar/sup
+/ ions under oxygen exposure has been measured between room temperature and
1500 degrees C by weight-loss measurements. The reduction of the erosion yield
as well as its enhancement could be found for Ar/sup +/ ion bombardment of
molybdenum under oxygen exposure, which is strongly dependent on both
temperature and oxygen pressure. It was also found in molybdenum that for
CO/sup +/ ion bombardment the erosion yield is reduced at 25 degrees C compared
with that for Ne/sup +/, although their theoretical values are nearly the same,
and increases up to a factor of three in a complicated manner as the
temperature rises, whereas for Ar/sup +/ ion bombardment the erosion yield
shows only a small increase with increasing temperature. On the other hand a
smaller temperature dependence and a reduced sputtering yield at 25 degrees C
was observed for CO/sup +/ bombardment of tungsten. The results are discussed
in relation to various oxidation processes of molybdenum and tungsten.<p>

Inhibition of hydrogen plasma erosion and enhancement in wear resistance of

Pub type:  Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: The hydrogen plasma erosion and abrasive wear resistance of glassy
carbon implanted with tungsten has been studied as a function of ion dose. It
was found that the onset of hydrogen plasma erosion inhibition occurred at a
dose of approximately 6.5*10/sup 15/ ion/cm/sup 2/. In addition, the tungsten
implanted material exhibits an increase in wear resistance similar in magnitude
to that obtained with nitrogen and other nonmetallic ions. Carbon ion
implantation does not significantly inhibit erosion in a hydrogen plasma.
Hence, the resistance to such erosion observed with tungsten implanted glassy
carbon is believed to be due to a chemical effect specific to certain metallic
ions. In contrast, increased wear resistance is a defect driven effect not
specific to the ion used.<p>

Abstract: The effect of hydrogen plasma erosion of glassy carbon implanted with
tungsten has been studied for a dose of 2.5*10/sup 16/ ions/cm/sup 2/ and an
average ion energy of 60 keV. Raman measurements of the tungsten-implanted
layer prior to and after exposure to the hydrogen plasma revealed that the
damaged layer induced by tungsten ion bombardment, unlike by C/sup +/
bombardment, has not been completely removed in the plasma erosion process.
Auger profile measurements were performed on the as-implanted layer and after
exposure to a hydrogen plasma for 1 h. By comparing the tungsten depth
distribution for these two cases the hydrogen plasma erosion rate of
tungsten-implanted glassy carbon has been estimated. It has been found that
during the first hour of exposure to the hydrogen plasma the average erosion
rate of the implanted layer was estimated to be 265+or-35 AA/h. In contrast the
erosion rate of unimplanted glassy carbon in the hydrogen plasma was found to
be 3000+or-300 AA/h.<p>

Abstract: The work described concerned the effect of carbon on the mechanical
properties of cast tungsten, obtained during short-term and long-term (on the
basis of 100 h) tests in the temperature range 1200-2000 degrees C (0.4-0.65
T/sub me/), and on its recrystallization temperature. Tungsten alloys
containing 0.01-0.2% (by mass) carbon were investigated. All mechanical tensile
tests were carried out on cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 5 mm and a
working part length of 25 mm using a PRV-203 machine with indirect heating in a
vacuum of 1.10/sup -4/ mm Hg. The strain rate was 1.6*10/sup -3/ sec/sup -1/.
The specimens were in a recrystallized state after annealing at 1800 degrees C
for 1 h. After heat treatment the grain size of W-C alloys varied over the
range 32-28 mu , depending on carbon content, while for nonalloyed tungsten it
was 45 mu .<p>

Abstract: Metastable W-Me-C (Me=Fe,Co) films were obtained by non-reactive RF

depends on the percentage of iron and cobalt in the films, varying from beta
-WC/sub 1-x/ to amorphous with the increasing content of these elements. The
structure of the crystalline films changes with temperature from beta -WC/sub
1-x/ to WC and W/sub 2/C. The crystallization mechanism of the amorphous films
is characterized by the formation of carbon-deficient phases, such as W/sub 2/C
or M/sub 6/C.

Abstract: Thermal desorption processes of H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ from clean
graphite surfaces and metal-deposited graphite surfaces have been investigated.
Thin metal layers of Ti, Cr and Fe on isotropic graphites were prepared by an
electron-beam evaporation method. For these specimens, the irradiation and the
desorption experiments were performed with the use of an ECR ion irradiation
apparatus. The desorption spectra of H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ from the clean
surface had only a single peak at 700 and 800 degrees C. These peaks were found
to originate from the diffusion limited process and to be attributed to the
intrinsic nature of graphite. The metal depositions on the graphite surface
caused a new desorption peak for H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ besides the intrinsic
peak. The temperature and intensity of the new peak depended on the metal
species. The presence of the metals increased the amount of adsorbed H/sub 2/
for fluences of more than 1*10/sup 18/ H/cm/sup 2/ but decreased the amount of
desorbed CH/sub 4/ in the whole fluence range of this study.<p>

Abstract: The authors have studied the condition for self-sustaining coating,
under which coverage with a segregated carbon layer protects a nickel layer
deposited on graphite from ion-induced sputtering. Both the concentration and
the sputtered flux of carbon atoms segregated onto the bombarded surface of the
nickel layer from the graphite underlayer are calculated as a function of ion
flux, utilizing a theoretical model which has been developed for analysis of
the preferential sputtering of alloys. The condition for self-sustaining
coating depends on the diffusion constant and the rate constant of segregation
to the bombarded surface. The calculated results are compared with the
experimental results of the ion-flux dependence of the sputtered fluxes of
nickel and carbon atoms and the rate of segregation for the nickel-carbon
system is 57 s/sup -1/ at 650 degrees C and 1.2 s/sup -1/ at 600 degrees C.
Using the obtained value, the critical thickness of the nickel layer for a
self-sustaining coating is evaluated of the order of 10/sup -2/ cm.<p>

Abstract: A WC layer deposited on graphite has been bombarded with a 5 keV
Ar/sup +/ ion beam at different fluxes at 1550 degrees C, as well as at
6*10/sup 13/ Ar/sup +/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ at different temperatures. The
thickness and the atomic composition of the carbide layer have been measured by
means of the RBS technique at each stage of the Ar/sup +/ bombardments. It is
found that the sputtering yield of W at 1550 degrees C decreases down to zero
at a critical value of 4.6*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ with decreasing ion
flux, and that the sputtering yield of W at 6*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/
also decreases down to zero at a critical temperature of 1600 degrees C with
increasing temperature. It is determined from the analysis of the latter data
that the activation energy of the dissolution rate of carbon atoms at the
surface is 2.0 eV, which is a key parameter for predicting the critical flux
and temperature under different conditions.

Abstract: SiC-coated graphite limiter material was eroded by a plasma during
the plasma edge experiments in Alcator C, and redeposited on the molybdenum
surface of the Janus probe. Surface morphology, composition and structure of
the deposit was examined after a total exposure time of approximately 1000 s.
The redeposited material typically showed a 'layered' morphology. AES depth
profiles revealed increased oxygen content in the redeposited material and an
apparent diffusion of Si and C at the deposit-molybdenum interface. Two clearly
distinguishable chemical states of silicon in the deposit, as observed by XPS,
suggest that plasma ionized polycrystalline SiC is being redeposited as a
mixture of SiC and SiO/sub x/. Preliminary examination of the near surface
regions by SIMS indicated (a) the presence of deuterium in the deposit, (b) the
presence of molybdenum in the first few layers of the deposit, (c) formation by
the plasma of multiple states of Si/sub x/O/sub x/, Si/sub x/C/sub x/, and
Si/sub x/C/sub x/O/sub x/ which do not appear in the spectrum of the unexposed
SiC.<p>

Abstract: In this paper we present data concerning impurity sources and
transport in a tokamak with a divertor and molybdenum first wall. A
spectrometer, viewing visible and UV light, has been used to take time
dependent spectra of C, O, and Mo from both the divertor and the inner limiter
surfaces. In the divertor the sputtering threshold for Mo is not normally
reached (T/sub e/&lt;or=25 eV). Chord measurements from four filtered
photo-diode arrays have enabled us to invert the measured brightness profiles
tomographically and obtain 2D emissivity information for H/sub alpha / and
CIII. The total C flux sputtered at the divertor target can be twice as high as
from the inner wall surface, increasing with density to about 2*10/sup 18/
s/sup -1/. However, modeling the SOL, we find that the penetration efficiency
for C is roughly 10 times smaller for the divertor than for the inner wall.
Oxygen fluxes are generally observed to be 1/3 of the C flux.<p>

Abstract: Alcator C-Mod is a high-field tokamak with which experiments were
initiated in April 1993. The divertor and the first-wall have plasma-facing
surfaces of molybdenum. The divertor has a configuration which is closed in
comparison to other, currently operating tokamaks. The combination of divertor
geometry and high field (density) make Alcator C-Mod an ideal experiment to
investigate dissipative (radiative/CX) divertor scenarios. Single-null divertor
operation has become the standard mode of operation. Relatively clean plasmas
(Z/sub eff/&lt;or=1.3) are obtained with short periods of baking and electron
cyclotron discharge cleaning only. Impurity source rates and screening have
been investigated with an extensive set of wavelength-filtered diode arrays and
spectrographs. Carbon and oxygen and molybdenum dominate the impurity levels.
The molybdenum source from the divertor proper is negligible.

Abstract: This letter reports on two experiments undertaken to evaluate the
retention of gaseous and target produced impurities in the ASDEX divertor. The
retention for gaseous impurities was determined by puffing Ar into the main
chamber and simulating the time behaviour of the Ar XVI line intensity with a
time dependent impurity transport code including a simple divertor model.
During ohmic heating a factor of 3 and 4.5 enhancement of impurity retention if
found relative to the vacuum time constant (90 ms) of divertor chamber, for
n/sub e/=2*10/sup 13/ and n/sub e/=3.5*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/, respectively,
while a drastic breakdown of the retention occurs during high power NI heating.
To deduce the retention of impurities generated at the divertor plates, a
segment (3.5%) of the plates was covered with copper, a metal previously not
used in ASDEX. By measuring the CU influx at the target plates and the line
intensity of the Cu XX line (11.38 AA) in the core plasma and by using the
transport code, it is found that during NI heating (n/sub e/&lt;or=2*10/sup 13/
cm/sup -3/) Cu atoms originating from the target plates have a &lt;or=3.5 times
higher probability to penetrate into the core plasma than if they had when
originating from the main chamber walls.<p>

Abstract: Metal impurity (Fe, Cu) fluxes to the divertor plates of ASDEX were
measured using a collector probe during discharges with various plasma
parameters. The Cu deposition shows generally a different distribution across
the scrape-off layer compared to the Fe deposition. The maximum Cu deposition
is close to the Cu divertor plates indicating evaporation or sputtering from
these plates. In the center of the SOL, Fe fluxes are indicative of the Fe
content in the central plasma. Variations of the Cu and Fe fluxes with
auxiliary heating and vessel carbonisation are analysed and discussed in
respect of impurity production mechanisms.<p>

Abstract: Carbon tiles and probes, which had been mounted on the vessel walls
of the divertor tokamak ASDEX during different experimental periods as well as
the Ti divertor plates removed in 1986 have been analysed with respect to
deposition of D and metal atoms. The lowest Fe, Ni, Cr deposition (5*10/sup 15/
cm/sup -2/) was found at the area where the separatrix intersects the divertor
plates, while the deposition is much larger (of the order of 10/sup 17/ cm/sup
-2/) at the divertor entrance and the walls of the divertor chamber, as well as
at the walls of the main discharge chamber. This indicates that metal atoms
deposited at the divertor plates are re-eroded, while the final sink for plasma
impurities are the walls of the divertor chamber and of the main plasma vessel.
During the last operation period the plates were made from Cu and the Cu
deposition on the vessel walls was found to increase with the number of
discharges indicating material transport from the divertor chamber into the
main plasma vessel. From the survey of metal atom deposition a material
transport balance is established comparing impurity sources and sinks.<p>

Abstract: The authors describe experiments undertaken to evaluate the retention
of target produced impurities in the ASDEX divertor. The titanium divertor
plates have recently been replaced by water-cooled copper plates. Since copper
is a material not previously present inside the ASDEX torus, a unique
possibility existed to study the transport of the target plate material from
the divertor chamber into the main plasma. By spectroscopic measurement of the
Cu flux emerging from the target plate and of the Cu density in the main
plasma, the retention is assessed. They find a poor retention (R=1) for low
n/sub e/ (n/sub e/&lt;3.0*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/) but a substantially improved
one (R&gt;30) at high densities. During additional heating (NI, ICRH) at the
same density as in the OH case, the retention is lower, but approaches similar
values at slightly higher densities. The retention seems to be independent of
the heating power.<p>

Abstract: The complete heavy impurity cycle of the divertor tokamak ASDEX is
presented. The impurity sources, i.e. sputtering at the vessel wall and at the
divertor plates, have been investigated spectroscopically or with special
erosion probes. The measured erosion fluxes agree with data from sputtering
calculations using measured incident charge exchange (CX) neutral and ion
fluxes. The impurity transport in the plasma boundary has been simulated with a
time dependent one-dimensional computer code. Central impurity confinements has
been investigated with a laser blow-off technique. Investigations on impurity
transport from the divertor plates back to the main plasma have shown a
surprisingly low retention capability of the divertor for plate produced
impurities at low densities, but no adequate code calculation is available.
Finally, the deposition of heavy impurities has been investigated with time
resolving probes and long term wall probes as well as through a post mortem
analysis of the limiters and divertor plates.<p>

Abstract: An experimental investigation of metallic impurities has been made in
the ASDEX divertor in order to better understand their likely sources and
production mechanisms. The impurities were collected on rotatable carbon
collector strips which were exposed to the scrape-off layer plasma near the
upper outer divertor plate under various discharge conditions. Quantitative ion
beam analysis of exposed samples were subsequently carried out by Rutherford
backscattering spectroscopy, proton induced X-ray emission and nuclear reaction
spectroscopy. Time resolved measurements and spatial profiles of collected
impurity fluxes reveal an increase in collected metallic impurities during
auxiliary neutral beam heating of plasma discharges causing strong erosion of
the copper divertor plate. To a rough approximation, 0.2% of this auxiliary
heating power is invested in the production of stainless steel impurities.
Measurements made for single-null divertor discharges show a copper flux of
6*10/sup17/ atoms.s/sup -1/ in the scrape-off layer which is not directly
sputtered from the target plates. Collected impurity fluxes in the divertor
chamber are found to increase with both the main plasma current and the
density. Measurements made after boronization reveal an initial reduction in
collected stainless steel impurities although boronization does not have any
long term effect on the suppression of such impurities. Some limitations of the
collector probe technique are also pointed out, and planned improvements of the
existing setup are outlined.<p>

Abstract: A high-purity graphite probe for collecting impurities in ASDEX has
been used for the first time. The probe head consists of a rotatable graphite
cylinder housed in a fixed molybdenum shield containing an exposure slit.
Measurements were made on the scrape-off layer plasma streaming to the upper
outer divertor plate and, after extraction of the probe, collected impurities
were identified and quantified using surface physics techniques. Single null
ohmic discharges produce a threefold increase in erosion of the Cu plate of the
active upper divertor compared to similar double null discharges. The radial
distributions of scrape-off layer impurities change in both shape and intensity
with vertical plasma position. Boronization of the main vessel reduces the
amount of Fe collected by more than a factor of two but the oxygen deposit
increases. Radial distributions of Cu and Fe deposits as a function of time for
a neutral beam heated discharge are also discussed.<p>

Abstract: Impurity production and transport in ASDEX have been studied using a
rotatable graphite collector probe which was exposed to the scrape-off layer
plasma in the upper divertor chamber. Metallic deposits on the probe were later
analysed using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reaction
analysis. Time resolved information (during tokamak discharges) and spatial
profiles of collected impurity fluxes indicate strong erosion of the copper
divertor plate during neutral beam heating of the plasma. Both stainless steel
and copper deposits increase with neutral beam power. It is shown that, to a
rough approximation, 0.2% of this auxiliary heating contributes to the increase
in collected stainless steel impurities. Measurements made for single-null
divertor discharges show that a copper flux of 6*10/sup 17/ atoms s/sup -1/ is
present in the scrape-off layer which is not directly sputtered from the target
plates. Measurements made subsequent to boronization reveal an initial
reduction in collected heavy impurities although boronization does not appear
to have any significant long-term effect on the suppression of such
impurities.<p>

Abstract: The origin of carbon and oxygen impurities observed in the bulk
plasma of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak is investigated by means of particle influx
measurements using spectroscopy in the visible spectral range and impurity
density measurements using spectroscopy in the soft X ray range. A number of
ohmically heated discharges are evaluated and statistically analysed to reduce
the influence of the individual experimental scatter. The interpretation of the
spectroscopic measurements is supported by mass spectrometry, which allows the
partial fluxes of the various molecular species to be resolved. The measured
fluxes and concentrations reveal a consistent picture: for low electron
densities and impure wall conditions, CO recycling in the main plasma chamber
is the dominant source of carbon and oxygen, leading to similar concentrations
of these species in the bulk plasma. At higher densities or with freshly
boronized walls, the oxygen concentration is significantly reduced to 0.05% of
the electron density. The corresponding reduction of carbon saturates at a
level of about 0.3%. This behaviour is attributed to chemical erosion due to
hydrocarbon formation and desorption with a yield of a few per cent of the
hydrogen flux. The resulting carbon ion flux is reduced owing to wall
redeposition, but still amounts to about 0.45% of the hydrogen flux. This level
imposes severe limitations on the use of graphite in a low temperature, high
recycling divertor of a future reactor.<p>

Abstract: The erosion, plasma penetration and redeposition of divertor plate
material such as C, Si, V, Mo and W have been studied in the ASDEX-Upgrade
divertor. Long-term erosion and redeposition have been studied using evaporated
markers, while time resolved measurements and plasma penetration were studied
spectroscopically on W tiles. The expected reduction of erosion due to plasma
ion sputtering could be confirmed. This reduced erosion is accompanied by
largely enhanced deposition for high-Z ions, when the gyroradius exceeds the
ionisation length.<p>

Abstract: Passive spectroscopy has been used for in situ studies of the erosion
of various divertor target materials in ASDEX-Upgrade. Yields measured for the
erosion of graphite over a range of moderate densities can be explained by
physical sputtering alone, although there may also be small contributions from
chemical processes. At high density, detachment of the divertor plasma occurs
and sputtering of the target ceases. Under such high-density conditions high-Z
materials, e.g. tungsten, offer a promising alternative to graphite. First
studies of the erosion of these materials confirm the expected low sputtering
rates and the short ionisation lengths of sputtered neutrals. The latter
implies efficient prompt redeposition which should suppress production of
higher ionisation stages and associated problems with self-sputtering.

Abstract: Since the introduction of new graphite tiles on the divertor regions
and the center post of DIII-D, beta backscatter measurements have been made of
the metals codeposited on these surfaces at three different times. At the first
vent (June 1988), the upper and lower portions of the machine appeared very
similar, with the average amount of metal on a surface increasing with
increasing radius and indications that local tile alignment had an effect on
the amount of metal deposited. Measurements made during subsequent vents show
that there has been much more metal deposited on the lower divertor than on the
upper. Metal seems to be concentrated at radii both less than and greater than
that expected for the strike zones. From measurements made during the latest
vent (December 1989) there is clear indication that material has been eroded
from a position of the outer strike zone, probably to be redeposited at a
larger radius.<p>

Abstract: Hydrogen recycling and impurity influx are important issues in
obtaining high confinement discharges in the DIII-D tokamak. To reduce metallic
impurities in DIII-D, 40% of the wall area, including the highest heat flux
zones, have been covered with graphite tiles. However, erosion, redeposition,
and hydrogen retention in the tiles, as well as metal transport from the
remaining Inconel walls, can lead to enhanced recycling and impurity influx.
Hydrogen and metal retention in divertor floor tiles have been measured using
external ion beam analysis techniques following four campaigns where tiles were
exposed to several thousand tokamak discharges. The areal density of deuterium
retained following exposure to tokamak plasmas was measured with external
nuclear reaction analysis. External proton-induced X-ray emission analysis was
used to measure the areal densities of metallic impurities deposited upon the
divertor tiles either by sputtering of metallic components during discharges or
as contamination during tile fabrication. Measurements for both deuterium and
metallic impurities were taken on both the tile surfaces which face the
operating plasma and the surfaces on the sides of the tiles which form the
small gaps separating each of the tiles in the divertor. The highest areal
densities of both deuterium (from 2 to 8*10/sup 18/ atoms/cm/sup 2/) and metals
(from 0.2 to 1*10/sup 18/ atoms/cm/sup 2/) were found on the plasma-facing
surface near the inner strike point region of each set of divertor tiles.
Significant deposits, extending as far as 1 cm from the plasma-facing surface
and containing up to 40% of the total divertor deposition, were also observed
on the gap-forming surfaces of the tiles.<p>

For a tungsten film, no appreciable erosion was detected. However, measurements
of deposited tungsten on adjacent carbon surfaces indicated a net W erosion
rate of 0.06 nm/s.

Abstract: The determination of actual depth profiles of metals deposited
simultaneously with a variety of lighter elements on a rough technical carbon
surface is complicated by the unknown deposit topography and possibly by
diffusion to substantial depths through pores into the bulk. It is demonstrated
that a suitable combination of RBS and PIXE allows a useful estimate of
'effective depths' in the sense in which it may be important for the better
understanding of plasma limiter interactions.<p>

Abstract: The interaction of the boundary plasma with the limiters has been
analyzed for two 5 MA 20 s Ohmic discharges in JET by Langmuir probes and by an
all carbon collector probe. The deposition of D, C, Ni and Cr and the erosion
on the probe have been measured as functions of the distance to the last closed
magnetic flux surface. The values are compared to the particle fluences and
their energies as calculated from the measured plasma parameters. The
calculated deuterium fluences are about a factor of 5 to 10 larger than the
deposition on the probe and the calculated e-folding length is steeper than the
measured values. The carbon deposition and erosion at the probe has been
determined with the aid of /sup 13/C implants as well as from the depth of the
metal and deuterium depositions and the interference colours of the deposited
films. The distribution of deposited carbon similar to the trapped deuterium
with a ratio D:C of about 0.3, indicating that D trapping is dominated by
saturation of the deposited C layer. The metal deposition is small; it amounts
to a few times 10/sup -3/ of the carbon deposition, indicating the dominance of
carbon in the boundary layer.

Abstract: The isotropic graphite ETP-10 was used as the divertor tiles
(divertor plate) in the lower X-point configuration of JT-60. For these
graphite tiles, numerous surface properties were investigated. The surface
morphology was largely changed into a spongelike, column or smooth structure.
The Raman spectroscopy analysis showed that the structure was composed of
broadened crystal and defective structures, in addition to the amorphous
structure, in every surface region. As the major impurities, O, Ti, Ni, Cr and
Fe were detected by both AES analysis and PIXE analysis. The total outgassing
amount, measured by the technique of TDS, was one or two orders of magnitude
larger than that of the as-received sample. At the surface within a depth of 50
nm, the hydrogen concentration ranged from 10 to 20 at.%. A considerable amount
of hydrogen was observed in the deeper region up to several millimeters.<p>

Abstract: Damage to a TiC coated Mo divertor plate used in JT-60 for about two
years was re-examined from a material viewpoint to obtain data concerning
utilization of high-Z plasma facing components in future fusion reactors.
Serious damage was observed on the edge of several divertor plates located next
to a toroidal gap. Due to very high heat fluxes a part of the edge was melted
and a large crack of about 12 cm wide and 2.5 cm deep was caused near the
melted edge along a lamination of the Mo plate. Recrystallization by the heat
loading embrittled the subsurface region and resulted in cracking and melting
at a lower heat loading. The present work suggests that the maximum temperature
of the powder metallurgical Mo should be maintained below the recrystallization
temperature to prevent material degradation and plasma radiation losses.

Abstract: A plasmachemical in-situ technique for the deposition of carbon on
limiters and first wall of the tokamak TEXTOR has been developed. RG-discharge
in a throughflow of hydrogen with admixed 1.5% methane has been used to implant
methane ions into the limiters and wall. Different samples (Inconel 600) in
liner position have been exposed and afterwards analyzed with SIMS and AES. It
has been shown that during the plasmachemical carbon deposition at 240 degrees
C predominantly chromium carbide was formed in the surface near layer. Nickel
carbide was traced in a negligibly small amount. Depth profiles indicate an
exponential dependence of the chromium carbide concentration up to a depth of
about 10 nm. This is in agreement with the estimated diffusion profile of
carbon; literature values of the carbon diffusivity in Ni, Ni-Cr and Ni-Co
alloys yield a mean characteristic diffusion length of about 8 nm. The total
amount of deposited carbon as determined from AES measurements is 6*10/sup 15/
atoms cm/sup -2/, in reasonable agreement with 1.2*10/sup 16/ cm/sup -2/ as
determined from the partial pressure balance during the carbidization

Abstract: Carbonaceous films as produced for in-situ wall conditioning purposes
in the TEXTOR tokamak have been investigated with SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass
Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). The measurements were
supplemented by optical analyses and mechanical thickness measurements. The
exposure to the in-situ carbonization process has been performed by placing the
samples (Si, graphite, glassy carbon, Ni, Cr and Inconel) in linear positions.
Independent of the substrate material the obtained films were homogeneous in
thickness and composition. Depth profiles revealed impurity-free films with
constant C/H ratio and slightly contaminated interfaces. The contaminants, i.e.
metals (Fe, Ni, Cr) and O as detected on appropriate substrates, are supposed
to be deposited due to sputtering of wall material during the initial period of
the carbonization process. The hydrogen in the carbon film is strongly bound.
Exchange processes of the incorporated hydrogen during plasma discharges have
been investigated. Blistering of the carbon films during noble gas ion
bombardment have been observed.<p>

Abstract: Surface analysis has been carried out on samples exposed to
carbonization, discharge cleaning and tokamak discharges with Auger Electron
Spectroscopy (AES). A carbon layer of approximately 30 monolayers on an Inconel
sample was neither fully removed nor contaminated during exposure to 134
tokamak discharges at the liner position. The carbon layer was also not removed
with exposure to 25 discharges at 1 cm behind the main limiters. Deposition of
metals and oxygen was observed on the top surface of the C-layer in this case.
Deposition of carbon on silicon samples was found with a carbonized wall after
exposure to tokamak discharges. From a semi-quantitative discussion of these
experimental results, it has been concluded that the C-layer on the liner, on
Faraday shields and on limiters have long life time, and redeposition processes
contribute to maintaining the carbon layer. Removal of the carbon layer by
glow-discharge cleaning has also been demonstrated.<p>

Abstract: The carbonization of the metallic liner and limiters of TEXTOR led to
plasmas which contained less than 10/sup -5/ metal, and, in best cases,
(0.6+or-0.4)% low Z ions per D/sup +/. However disruptions damaged some of the
carbon film and evaporated metal atoms. These were redeposited on the carbon
layer and became a source of impurities. Graphite limiters have been used since
mid-1985. The metal pollution is not a problem for more than 1000 discharges
after one carbonization. However the low Z contamination was initially five
times larger than earlier. Surprisingly, the oxygen concentration had
considerably increased. Experiments were performed to identify the sources of C
and O and to improve the conditioning methods in this 'all carbon' surrounding.
The main tools used were: RG (radiofrequency assisted DC glow) discharges in
H/sub 2/, D/sub 2/, and their mixtures with CH/sub 4/ and CD/sub 4/, the study
of the H/D ratio in water and hydrocarbons and of the CO and CO/sub 2/ released
during the ramp heating and cooling of limiters, liner, vessel and main
portholes, and the modulation of the deuterium fluxes to the liner and limiters
during tokamak discharges. The quality of tokamak plasmas measures the progress
of the wall conditioning. The authors describe the optimized conditioning
procedure which was applied after the most probable oxygen source had been
drastically reduced.<p>

probe was exposed to several discharges. Generally, the areal concentration of
oxygen was found to be 15-25 times higher than that of metals and about 5-8
times lower than that of trapped deuterium. The influence of ICR heating,
plasma density and other plasma parameters upon the deposition rate of oxygen
and other species are discussed. The possible chemical state of the deposited
oxygen is considered.<p>

Abstract: Impurity fluxes of metals have been determined in the scrape-off
layer of TEXTOR. Time-resolved measurements have been performed using graphite
collector probes. Results were found when ALT II acted as the only limiter and
were compared to earlier operational phases. Typical fluxes were (1-8)*10/sup
18/ atoms m/sup -2/ s/sup -1/. The metal density was determined to be in the
range 10/sup 15/ atoms m/sup -3/, and the cross-field diffusion coefficient 6
m/sup 2/ s/sup -1/. A distinct reduction of deposited metals as well as
deuterium and oxygen was found in comparison to earlier measurements performed
in the presence of the poloidal and ALT I limiters. Increased fluxes were
observed during auxiliary ICR heating.<p>

Abstract: Long-term samples literally cut out of the TEXTOR liner after 31
months of tokamak operation and with 81 a-C:H coatings and corresponding
wall-cleaning cycles have been analyzed for carbon and carbide contents. The
analysis consisted in AES depth-profiling, AES line-scanning, and
electro-chemical etching of sample cross-sections. A 10 to 35 mu m thick
under-stoichiometric carbide layer with 10 at.% of carbon at the surface was
found. There is an unpredicted correlation between the thickness of the
individual coatings and the carbide layer, although 50% fluctuations in the
toroidal distribution are observed. Apparently more than 20% of the carbon
supply to the surface during coating is built into the liner surface, despite
the glow discharge cleaning of the remaining a-C:H before each new deposition.
The presence of the carbide layer may in general cause changes in the
mechanical and thermal properties of the first wall in plasma devices which are
routinely carbonized.<p>

Abstract: The material redeposited on the collector probe in the SOL of TEXTOR
after boronization has been identified as a-C/B:D, i.e. as almost identical
with the virgin coating. A conversion factor of 6.3*10/sup 17/ C/cm/sup 2/ for
100 nm thickness was found which corresponds to a density rho =1.26 g/cm/sup
2/. Erosion of C and B from the coated graphite limiters causes stationary
deposition during the discharge and distributions within the SOL. After 200
discharges the ratio B/C=0.23 is lower than the original (B/C approximately
0.5-1). Observations made with the collector probe confirm the reduced C and O
contamination of the plasma due to boronization. Carbon rates have been
determined shotwise after an integrated exposure by AES-depth profiling of the
stratified deposit. A deposition rate of 1*10/sup 16/ C/cm/sup 2/ s typically
was found at a+2 cm and n/sub e/=2.8*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/. It increases at
lower densities as do the other impurities.<p>

Abstract: The graphite limiters and the inconel liner of TEXTOR have been
coated in-situ with boron-doped carbonaceous film (boronization). Several
samples of SS 304, Inconel 600, graphite (EK 98) and silicon single crystals
were exposed to the boronization procedure at two different toroidal locations
(liner level). The depth composition of the deposited layers (noted as a-C/B:H)
have been investigated later by AES analysis combined with Ar-sputtering, and
by SNMS. Depth profiles showed the homogeneity of the films. In addition, a
toroidal variation in the B/C-ratio ( approximately=0.5 and approximately=1.0),
in the hydrogen content, as well as in the thickness, was observed. No traces
of bulk oxidation were found. A boronized Inconel target, exposed to 253
tokamak discharges in D/sub 2/, exhibits only a minute erosion of the
originally deposited film. An additional thin layer deposited by plasma
transport on the surface contained mainly carbon, and little boron, oxygen and
metal impurities.<p>

Abstract: Impurities transported in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of a tokamak
TEXTOR were collected on Si samples exposed in SOL, and their amounts were
measured quantitatively, using an in situ surface analysis station equipped
with an Auger electron analyser and an ion gun. Tokamak discharges have been
made in all carbon surroundings, i.e. graphite limiters and the carbonized
liner and also recently in boron-carbon coated (boronized) surroundings. The
analysis shows that mainly carbon is collected accompanied by oxygen (less than
approximately 15%), and by boron (approximately 20%), after boronization. The
authors present data concerning the amount of the redeposited carbon as a
function of the toroidal distance between the sample and limiters, and of the
electron density, in order to discuss the mechanism of its redeposition.<p>

Abstract: Plasma induced erosion and redeposition at the vessel walls has been
measured by surface layer analysis of a carbon probe with evaporated markers
before and after exposure in the boundary plasma of the TEXTOR tokamak. The
results are compared with those calculated with the computer simulation program
ERO. The erosion is dominated by carbon and oxygen impurity fluxes in the
boundary plasma. Carbon is deposited on the marker surfaces and has to be
resputtered for the marker material to be sputtered. Mo atoms sputtered from
the marker are found to be redeposited in the slit of the probe. The
redeposition pattern can be explained by direct deposition of sputtered Mo
neutrals.<p>

Abstract: In TEXTOR a Mo limiter has been tested under various conditions of
ohmic and NBI heating for about 100 discharges. Maximum power fluxes of 20
MW/m/sup 2/ have been loaded onto the Mo limiter without any serious damage
which led to maximal surface temperatures of about 2800 K. The Mo-limiter
surface was molten twice with a very thin layer of melting. Local spectroscopy
shows that Mo is released predominantly by physical sputtering of the low-Z
impurities carbon, oxygen and silicon. The impurity deposition rates in the SOL
were measured using collector probes showing a ratio of Si/C and Mo/C of
typically 6/100 and 0.1-1/100, respectively. Post-mortem analyses have revealed
no impurity deposition on the Mo surface indicating that the limiter was
operated under erosion conditions. The Mo limiter did not influence the plasma
performance very much except for high-density ohmic shots where strong central
radiation appeared resulting in a minor disruption or special mode. No serious
after-effect due to a possible contamination of the first wall by Mo impurities
could be observed.<p>

Abstract: In TEXTOR a high Z limiter experiment was carried out. Mo and W were
used as a limiter (10 cm long, 6 cm wide and 5 cm high) and inserted up to 3 cm
closer to the plasma than to the main limiter, an ALT-II graphite limiter. Both
the thermal response of the limiter and the influence to the plasma performance
were analyzed in detail and compared with those for the fine-grained graphite
(EK98) routinely used. Maximum power fluxes of about 20 MW m/sup -2/ for 2 s
could be loaded on the Mo limiter without severe damage, and the maximum
surface temperature was about 2600 degrees C. Consequently the limiter surface
was subjected to local melting leaving the trace of molten layers. However, the
evaporated Mo during the melting did not influence the main plasma very much,
probably owing to redeposition of Mo within one period of gyromotion after the
ionization. After the experiment the surface of the Mo limiter was examined by
various techniques. Although the limiter head was not seriously damaged,
appreciable recrystallization and grain growth were observed, which enhanced
the propagation of intergranular cracking owing to the thermal stress triggered
by congruent melting with the thermocouple. No deposition of impurities of B,
C, O and Si which were the main impurities in the TEXTOR plasma, was observed
on the limiter head. The very high temperature of the limiter surface seems to
promote the evaporation of once-deposited impurities.

Abstract: The plasma contacting surfaces of the TFTR movable limiter consist of
an array of titanium carbide coated graphite tiles. The surface characteristics
of the graphite tiles were analyzed prior to installation to establish the
initial limiter conditions, and after exposure to 800 Ohmically heated
discharges in TFTR to provide data on the limiter conditioning processes. Some
tiles surfaces showed nearly complete removal of the TiC surface as a result of
plasma exposure. 3D and 2D elemental mapping of the tile surface region show
deposition of vacuum vessel metals (primarily Ti and Ni) in the form of
oxides.<p>

Abstract: Central medium and low Z impurity concentrations and Z/sub eff/ have
been measured by X-ray spectrometry in Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor discharges
during three periods of operation. These were (1) startup period, (2) ohmic
heating, and (3) ohmic heating portion of the two neutral beam periods,
distinguished mainly by different vacuum vessel internal hardware and
increasing plasma current and toroidal field capability. Plasma parameters
spanned minor radius a=0.41-0.83 m, major radius R=2.1-3.1 m, current I/sub
p/=0.25-2.0 MA, line averaged electron density n/sub e/=(0.9-4.0)*10/sup 19/
m/sup -3/, and toroidal magnetic field B/sub T/=1.8-4.0 T. The metal impurities
came mostly from the limiter. At low densities titanium or nickel approached 1%
of n/sub e/ during operation on a TiC-coated graphite or Inconel limiter,
respectively. Lower levels of Cr, Fe and Ni (&lt;or approximately=0.1%) were
observed with a graphite limiter at similarly low densities; these elements
were removed mainly from stainless steel or Inconel hardware within the vacuum
vessel during pulse discharge cleaning or plasma operation on an Inconel
limiter and then deposited on the graphite limiter. Hardware closet to the
plasma contributed most to the deposits. Subsequent discharge slowly eroded the
deposits from the limiter and reduced the metal impurity levels in the plasma.
Both total low Z and metal impurity concentrations, relative to n/sub e/,
decreased approximately exponentially with n/sub e/ and increased with I/sub
p/. The metals showed much larger variations than did low Z elements, dropping
to &gt;or approximately=10/sup -5/ n/sub e/ at high density. Low Z impurities,
mainly carbon and oxygen, ranged from 10% of n/sub e/ at low n/sub e/ to 3% at
high n/sub e/ and usually dominated Z/sub eff/ and power loss. In low density
plasmas with a TiC-coated graphite or Inconel limiter, the respective metals
contributed 30-50% of Z/sub eff/ and &lt;or approximately=10-20% of the central
input power. The metal contributions to Z/sub eff/ and radiated power were much
lower with the graphite limiter.<p>

Abstract: The important impurities in ohmically heated TFTR plasmas are carbon
and oxygen. The concentration of O is independent of the mass or charge of the
fuel gas; C is slightly less abundant in D plasmas than in He plasmas. C is
more abundant than O by a factor of 10 at low densities (Sin/sub e/
approximately=2*10Su1/sup 9/ m/sup -3/); at the high density limit (n/sub e/
equivalent to 4*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/ for H, n/sub e/ equivalent to 8*10/sup 19/
m/sup -3/ for He) the O concentration is equal to or slightly greater than that
of C. The impurity concentration as a function of edge electron temperature is
compared with a simple sputtering model which shows the importance of C-C and
O-C sputtering at the limiter in addition to fuel gas sputtering in explaining
the observed carbon concentration.<p>

Agreement between the analytical model and the experimental data is good. The

Abstract: Special limiter conditioning techniques using low density deuterium
or helium discharges have produced enhanced plasma confinement in TFTSR.
Measurements with a rotatable collector probe have been made to increase our
understanding of the boundary layer during these conditioning sequences. A set
of silicon films behind slits facing in the ion and electron drift directions
was exposed to four difference D/sup +/ and He/sup 2+/ discharge sequences. The
amounts of deuterium and impurities trapped in the surface regions of the
samples have been measured by different analytical techniques, including
nuclear reaction analysis for retained deuterium, Rutherford backscattering
spectroscopy for carbon and metals, and Auger electron spectroscopy for carbon,
oxygen and metals. Up to 1.9*10/sup 17/ cm/sup -2/ of deuterium was detected in
codeposited carbon layers with D/C generally in the range of the bulk
saturation limit. Radial profiles and ion drift/electron drift asymmetries are
discussed.<p>

Abstract: A plasma-enhanced CVD process was used to deposit thin (40-100 nm),
amorphous carbon/boron films onto the first wall of TFTR. A series of plasma
experiments was performed to test the effect of this first-wall modification on
low-Z impurity (carbon, oxygen) behavior, suppression of metallic impurities,
post-disruption recovery, hydrogenic recycling, and plasma density limits. The
analysis of the plasma performance following the first few boronization
attempts on TFTR shows: (1) suppression by a factor of 1.5-3 of carbon
impurities immediately after boronization, although this suppression is
short-lived ( approximately 10 shots); (2) long term suppression of oxygen and
metallic impurities by a factor of two; (3) significant suppression of oxygen
impurity emission following disruptions and during pulse discharge cleaning;
and (4) no significant change in hydrogenic recycling properties in comparison
to the pre-existing carbon first wall.

As beryllium was selected as a reference plasma-facing material for the ITER, a
literature search for the use of beryllium in tokamaks has been performed using
the MELVYL INSPEC database. Beryllium has been used as a plasma-facing material
in three tokamaks such as Unitor, ISX-B, and JET. We examined the database for
papers published between 1/1/69 and 9/25/95 using "the name of the tokamk" and
"beryllium" for a "find title words" command. In the following report, we have
listed the bibliographic information and abstracts for each tokamak.<b>

Abstract: Beryllium rail limiters were inserted into the plasma of the tokamak
Unitor to study the behavior of this material. The power load onto the limiter
surface was about 2 kW.cm/sup -2/. The occurrence of heavy (Cr) and light (O)
impurities was monitored spectroscopically. It was found that the contamination
by heavy impurities stemming from the first wall (Cr) was reduced by a factor
of ten in the course of a few subsequent shots. In comparison with other
limiter materials (graphite, TiC, spinel, Ni, Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/) the number of
disruptive discharges was considerably reduced. After breaking the vacuum and
opening the vessel, the beryllium deposition on the wall and the various
components (pumps, mass spectrometer, etc.) were studied. No volatile beryllium
dust could be detected by samplers. The released beryllium was found to be
quantitatively condensed on the torus wall with a thickness of ten monolayers
after 1000 tokamak shots.<p>

Abstract: Beryllium rail limiters are inserted into the tokamak UNITOR to study
the compatibility of this material with the plasma. The power load onto the
limiter surface is 1-2 kW/cm/sup 2/ during the plasma pulse length of 50 ms
duration. The concentration of heavy (Cr) and light (O) impurities is monitored
by means of spectroscopy. In comparison with other materials tested likewise
(graphite, Ni, Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/, TiC, SiC, SS) the Be-experiments have shown
the following improvements: (a) the concentration of heavy impurities is
considerably reduced, (b) this reduction is preserved if the poloidal
Be-limiters are retracted from the plasma, (c) the plasma resistivity is
diminished, (d) the occurrence of disruptions decreases. A total amount of 6 mg
beryllium was found distributed on the inner torus wall after 1500 shots. The
decontamination of the apparatus was performed without major problems. Only
very little volatile Be-dust was detected, and peripheric parts (pumps, mass
spectrometer etc.) were not contaminated. The beryllium released from the
limiters was found to be entirely deposited on the torus wall mainly in the
vicinity of the limiters.<p>

Abstract: The release and transport of beryllium in a tokamak plasma are
investigated numerically in order to characterize the impurity concentrations
and fluxes. A model has been developed and applied to the small-scale tokamak
UNITOR when operated with beryllium limiters. The source term for the beryllium
influx is evaluated to be approximately 10/sup 18/ s/sup -1/. The spatial
distributions of the various beryllium ions are given which reveal that fully
stripped beryllium is dominant in the plasma core. There the contribution of
beryllium to Z/sub eff/ is at most 1. Further, the solution of rate equations
indicates that the population densities of ground state and metastable neutral
beryllium are of comparable order. These theoretical results will be used to
interpret measurement of the beryllium concentrations and fluxes in front of
the limiter by laser-induced fluorescence, which are now under way.<p>

Abstract: The use of beryllium as a wall and limiter material is investigated
in the small Tokamak UNITOR. The transport of neutral and ionized beryllium
released from poloidal limiter is studied both experimentally and numerically.
The numerical simulation is based on an impurity transport algorithm in
cylindrical geometry. It comprises anomalous diffusion as well as ionization;
recombination via charge exchange processes is included for highly ionized
beryllium atoms. The code yields the spatial distribution of the various
ionization states with densities up to 4% of the electron density n/sub e/ and
fluxes up to 10/sup 19/ m/sup -2/s/sup -1/. The contribution of beryllium to
Z/sub eff/ is evaluated to be well below 1. The spatial and temporal
distribution of neutral beryllium is measured by laser induced fluorescence.
For this purpose, the Be I resonance line at 234.9 nm is pumped by a frequency
doubled dye laser. These measurements yield the densities as well as the fluxes
of neutral beryllium released from the limiter. The experimental results reveal
that besides sputtering additional erosion mechanisms are of importance.<p>

Abstract: Laser-induced fluorescence experiments are performed in UNITOR in
order to study the release and the transport of beryllium which is ablated from
poloidal limiters. The concentrations of neutral and ionized beryllium atoms
are measured. The experimental results are used as input data for
two-dimensional transport calculations. The results show that low-lying
ionization stages of beryllium remain localized in the vicinity of the limiter.
The bulk contamination consists of fully stripped beryllium at a level of about
0.9% n/sub e/ at the centre. This indicates that beryllium contributes at most
0.14 to Z/sub eff/.<p>

Abstract: The release of beryllium from poloidal limiter tiles was investigated
by laser-induced fluorescence. The measured beryllium fluxes are in the range
10/sup 19/-10/sup 20/ m/sup -2/ s/sup -1/, depending on the proton flux and
heat load onto the limiters. Evaluation of the data shows that besides physical
sputtering by protons sublimation becomes important at elevated surface
temperatures. The density of neutral metastables in front of the limiter was
found to be two times higher than the ground-state density.

Abstract: The elements and strategy of a program to develop low Z surfaces for
tokamak reactors is described. The development of low Z coated limiters is
selected as an interim goal. Candidate materials were selected from the
elements: Be, B, Al, Ti, V, C, O, N and their compounds. The effect of low
energy erosion on surface morphology is shown for Be, TiC and VBe/sub 12/. The
trade-offs in coating design are described. Stress analysis results for TiB/sub
2/-coated POCO graphite limiters for ORNL's ISX-B tokamak are given.<p>

Abstract: A movable, temperature-controlled beryllium rail limiter has been
used in the Impurity Study Experiment (ISX-B) tokamak at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL). The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the
suitability of the material for installation on the Joint European Torus (JET)
experiment. The limiter was designed for a surface temperature rise of 600
degrees C for each tokamak shot. This rise corresponds to a heat flux to the
limiter surface of approximately 2.1 to 2.4 kW/cm/sup 2/ for 0.3 s. The
experimental test was expected to require a lifetime of approximately 3000
neutral beam-heated plasma discharges to meet the planned surface fluence of
10/sup 22/ hydrogen ions per cm/sup 2/. A temperature control system was used
to maintain the base-plate temperature of the limiter at about 200 degrees C.
Normal plasma radius was 24 cm. the experimental results indicate that the
beryllium limiter functions normally unless brought to melting point, when
evaporated beryllium covers the liner walls, gettering the discharge. Under
these conditions beryllium was the dominant impurity.<p>

Abstract: Materials testing of S-65-B beryllium has been conducted in support
of the beryllium limiter experiment on the ISX-B tokamak at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. The S-65-B grade of hot-pressed beryllium was chosen over S-200-E
because of its superior strength and ductility at elevated temperatures. The
testing has included measurement of tensile and yield strength, ductility,
Young's Modulus, thermal conductivity, and specific heat from 50 degrees C to
700 degrees C. Thermal fatigue testing of a 2.5 cm beryllium cube was conducted
using an electron beam to apply a heat flux of 2.5 kw/cm/sup 2/ for 0.3 second
pulses for 1500 cycles. Results from the tests are compared to elastic-plastic
finite element stress calculations. The testing indicates that the ISX-B
beryllium limiter should survive the tokamak environment without serious
structural failure, although some surface cracking is expected to occur.<p>

Abstract: An experiment to test beryllium as a limiter material has been
performed in the ISX-B tokamak. One facet of the studies centred on
characterizing impurity influxes and concentrations. The radiation from both
low-Z (Be, C, N, O) and intermediate-Z (Ti, Cr) contaminants was measured at
the limiter surface and at a wall location 90 degrees away from the limiter to
assess the relative contributions of metallic impurities from the two different
sources. The effect of limiter melting, with concomitant reduction of both
low-Z and intermediate-Z elements, was also documented. The analysis, including
atomic rate coefficients for interpreting spectral radiation in terms of
production rates is discussed in detail.<p>

Abstract: Materials testing of S-65-B grade beryllium has been conducted in
order to evaluate the use of this material for limiter surfaces in the ISX-B
and JET tokamaks. Selected thermal and mechanical properties were measured at
temperatures up to 700 degrees C. These measurements revealed that S-65-B has
exceptionally high ductility (up to roughly 50% elongation) at temperatures
expected in normal operation of a beryllium limiter. Thermal fatigue tests
under conditions relevant to limiters in ISX-B and JET were also performed
using the Sandia National Laboratories Electron Beam Test System (EBTS).
Results from these tests were compared to calculated results based on
elastic-plastic finite element stress analyses. It was concluded from these
tests and analyses that properly designed beryllium limiters should survive
normal operation in ISX-B, JET, and similar devices without serious structural
failure. Some degree of surface cracking can be expected, however unless cyclic
plastic deformation at the heated surfaces can be adequately controlled by
careful design of the limiter.<p>

Abstract: An experiment has been performed on the Impurity Study Experiment
(ISX-B) tokamak to test beryllium as a limiter material. Beryllium is an
attractive candidate for a limiter and has been proposed for use in the Joint
European Torus (JET) experiment. A temperature-controlled, segmented, beryllium
top-rail limiter was located inside the plasma radius described by the existing
titanium limiters. An extended set of diagnostics was added for measurement of
scrapeoff and limiter parameters. These included visible and infrared
monitoring systems, probes, and surface analysis experiments. Tokamak
experiments included parameter surveys of both Ohmically heated and
neutral-beam-heated plasmas and an extended fluence test of the limiter. The
most significant effect of operation with a beryllium limiter was the reduction
in low-Z impurities caused by gettering action of beryllium deposited on the
liner walls. The experiment required the design and implementation of
contamination control apparatus and work procedures to prevent the accidental
dispersion of beryllium dust.<p>

Abstract: An experiment to test beryllium as a limiter material has been
performed in the ISX-B tokamak. The effect of the plasma on the limiter and the
effect of the limiter on the plasma were studied in detail. Heat and particle
fluxes to the limiter were measured, and limiter damage by melting was
documented as a function of power flux. Strong melting and evaporation of the
limiter caused beryllium gettering of the vacuum vessel. Postmortem analysis of
the limiter was performed to document the amount of retained hydrogen and the
erosion and impurity deposition on the limiter. The effect of the limiter on
the plasma performance was studied in terms of parameter space, impurity
content, and confinement for the ungettered and gettered cases. Operational
experience with beryllium in a fusion experiment is discussed.<p>

Abstract: A beryllium limiter has been installed in the Impurity Study
Experiment-B (ISX-B) tokamak to test the applicability of beryllium as a
plasma-side component for possible use in the Joint European Torus (JET). This
test is a collaborative effort involving both ORNL and JET personnel. The ISX-B
tokamak is operated for more than 3000 high power neutral beam injected
discharges using the beryllium limiter as the main confining aperture. In order
to access the migration of beryllium in the tokamak and attached diagnostics,
both stainless steel and silicon samples are placed at various strategic
positions and used as catcher plates. Nuclear reaction analysis is used to
measure the beryllium deposited on the plates and provided a measure of the
beryllium migration. Both particulates and a thin film are found. The toroidal
distribution of these two migration components is presented as well as a
discussion of the analysis technique for the deposited beryllium. Analysis is
made of the distribution of beryllium particulate matter deposited on the
inside of the vessel wall. Both a size distribution and spatial distribution
are presented.<p>

Abstract: The weight changes of Be tiles which functioned as a rail limiter in
the Impurity Study Experiment-B (ISX-B) for more than 3500 beam-heated
discharges have been determined. The net weight loss for the limiter is 2.0 g,
with the central tiles losing a total of 3.2 g, and the inboard tiles gaining
1.2 g. The weight loss is attributed primarily to the release of Be droplets as
a result of limiter surface melting. The weight gains result from an inward
flow of molten material along the limiter surface. The results indicate high
erosion (melt loss) with incomplete and nonuniform redeposition (melt flow) of
limiter material during periods of limiter melting.<p>

Abstract: Changes in plasma impurities and radiated power due to cleanup and
gettering during the beryllium limiter experiment are related to changes of the
surface composition of the torus walls and residual gases in the torus. Pulse
discharge cleaning was very effective in cleaning the ISX-B vacuum vessel after
installation of the beryllium limiter. As a result of discharge cleaning, areas
near the limiter were soon covered with a beryllium rich deposit containing
some iron, nickel, chromium, and titanium as well as oxygen, carbon, sulfur,
and nitrogen. Oxygen levels on the wall were reduced to below 10 at.%.
Materials transport during discharge cleaning was apparently due to sputtered
neutrals. Evaporation of beryllium from the limiter and subsequent deposition
on the torus walls caused by high power tokamak shots produced gettering of the
machine equal or better than that previously obtained with titanium or
chromium. This gettering by beryllium eliminated the need for further discharge
cleaning or other gettering. Beryllium transport in this case appears to be
mostly as ions in the plasma edge.<p>

Abstract: One of 12 beryllium tiles on a top rail limiter in the impurity study
experiment (ISX-B) tokamak was intentionally made radioactive. The migration of
the radioactivity due to melting, ablation, and general excoriation of the
radioactive tile was studied. Several hundred milligrams of material from the
radioactive tile were spread to the other tiles over the course of the
experiment, which consisted of more than 3000 tokamak discharges. A small
amount of activity was found on the bottom of the tokamak vacuum vessel. The
distribution of activity on the other limiter tiles showed a marked radially
inward directivity, although all of the tiles received some activity. The
possibility that some of the activity was the result of photo- and
electro-excitation by runaway electrons cannot be ruled out but probably cannot
account for the bulk of the effect.

Abstract: In JET, at full performance, the power injected through the ports
will reach 45 MW. From these 45 MW, 25 MW only will reach the center of the
plasma and will be efficient for the heating. This power will fall on the inner
wall of JET and on the limiters. The local thermal load on the limiters may
reach values as high as 10 MWm/sup -2/ for a duration of 10 s. In addition to
this, the material facing the plasma must be a 'low-Z material' in order to
limit the radiation from the impurities produced by sputtering and evaporation
of the limiter surface. The cooling foreseen uses the hypervapotron technique
(two phase system). The first cooled limiter on JET will be made of copper
covered by a layer of 1.5 mm nickel of 99.6% purity. This limiter could be
developed towards a low-Z one by replacing the nickel with a set of tiles of
carbon or beryllium. Uncooled limiters of graphite will also be installed on
JET. The concept of an antenna limiter which is being developed for the heating
of the JET plasma is another domain where the interaction of the plasma, the
electromagnetic waves and the antenna will play a dominant role.<p>

Abstract: Adequate impurity control has been achieved in short pulse tokamak
experiments using suitable limiter or divertor configurations. The aims of JET
will require effective impurity control with long pulses. The authors assess
the choice of nickel, graphite and beryllium for the limiter in JET and the
effectiveness of additional impurity control using a specified influx of neon
to cool the edge plasma. The limiter materials are distinguished with respect
to their ability, or otherwise, to allow plasmas with high central temperatures
and low limiter erosion. They concentrate on the effect of changes in the
particle transport and the effect of neon as a control gas to illustrate
important features of the assessment.<p>

Abstract: The processes producing impurities in tokamaks are still not well
understood, nor easy to predict in new machines. However, it is clear that
sputtering must be minimised. A model has recently been proposed which
discusses sputtering in terms of global parameters. The impurity level is
determined by a self-consistent energy balance between the input power, the
power radiated and the power conducted out. This model has been used as the
basis for comparison of three different limiter materials, nickel, carbon and
beryllium. Although some plasma parameters such as particle confinement time
are difficult to predict, the model allows the impurity behaviour to be readily
compared under a wide range of different conditions, including varying density
and additional heating. The effect of different levels of other impurities such
as oxygen can also be estimated.<p>

Abstract: It is proposed to use in JET a single low-Z material for the belt
limiters and the walls to reduce impurity radiation losses to the lowest level.
The only practical materials are graphite and beryllium. Their relative merits
are compared. Graphite has better thermomechanical properties than beryllium,
but simulation experiments on beryllium carried out at Sandia National
Laboratory and in ISX-B have proved these properties sufficient for the belt
limiters. Recent measurements indicate that beryllium retains 2-3 times less
hydrogen than graphite. The ISX-B experiments have shown that beryllium has an
excellent gettering action also. The main drawback of beryllium is the toxicity
of its dust, but the control of beryllium dust is well within standard
industrial techniques. It is concluded that beryllium offers the best prospects
as a material for the JET belt limiters and walls.<p>

Abstract: A limiter with an effective area in contact with the plasma of about
16 m/sup 2/ is presently being manufactured for installation in 1987. This belt
limiter consists of two toroidal rings located above and below the equatorial
plane of the vacuum vessel. Each of the two rings comprises a structure with
water cooling pipes and fins welded to the pipes. The limiter material in
contact with the plasma (graphite or beryllium) is inserted between fins in the
form of tiles. The belt limiter is designed to handle up to 40 MW of total
power at flux densities of 3-5 MW/m/sup 2/ for 10 s and to permit rapid
exchange of different limiter materials. This paper describes the design and
manufacture of the belt limiter and the results of thermomechanical analysis
for different edge properties, power levels and shot repetition rates.<p>

Abstract: Beryllium is an attractive alternative to graphite for use as armor
material for plasma interactive components in fusion devices because of its low
atomic number, high strength, and good compatibility with hydrogen. However,
beryllium is susceptible to damage from cyclic thermal stresses because of its
high elastic modulus and thermal expansion coefficient. The authors have
performed 2-D elastic-plastic finite element stress analyses of prototype
beryllium limiter tiles for the JET project that are exposed to a surface heat
flux of 250 W/cm/sup 2/ for 15 second pulses. Plastic deformation was predicted
to occur at the heated surface during both the heating and cooling phases of
the cycle, thereby causing cyclic plastic strain. They also performed thermal
fatigue tests using a rastered electron beam to apply the heat load to
prototype limiter specimens. After 10000 thermal fatigue cycles, the only
damage of the beryllium tile was microcracking of the heated surface. The depth
of this microcracking, 4 mm, corresponds closely to the calculated depth of
cyclic plastic strain. These favorable results show that the operating
conditions for the JET limiter design can be extended into the regime of cyclic
plastic deformation without causing overall structural failure, despite the
formation of thermal fatigue cracks.<p>

Abstract: About 50% ( approximately 100 m/sup 2/) of the inner surface of the
JET vessel is now covered in graphite tiles. High purity, fine grain graphite
was chosen for areas during the flat top time of the discharge, typically 10 s,
the power loads do not exceed 5 MW m/sup -2/; carbon fibre reinforced graphite
was selected for areas where loads above 20 MW m/sup -2/ can be expected. All
other parts of the walls are carbonized. Fine grain high purity graphite has
been employed for the limiters from the very beginning of plasma operation.
With increasing heating power the limiter surface has gradually been increased
from approximately 1.2 to approximately 15 m/sup -2/, and the power handling
capability to 40 MW for ten seconds. This paper describes modifications to the
inner wall introduced during the various operation phases of JET, the different
materials used, their performance in the presence of plasmas, and their
influence on plasma properties. Operational limits, future developments and the
use of beryllium as an alternative to the present concept of an all graphite
machine are discussed.<p>

Abstract: During Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating in JET
(Joint European Torus) with beryllium gettered walls and RF antenna screens
both the global and local impurity influxes are significantly reduced as
compared to the previous operation. In particular oxygen is reduced by an order
of magnitude and the deuterium is efficiently pumped. The deuterium recycling
R/sub D/&lt;1 except at the onset of RF pulse (1&lt;R/sub D/&lt;1.1) for t=0.75
s, indicating modest desorption. This provides the density control. Except for
the lowest densities, Z/sub eff/=2 at P/sub RF/=10 MW is routinely achieved. At
comparable densities, P/sub RAD//P/sub TOT/ is 30-50% lower. If we assume that
the long term evolution of the beryllium signal at the antenna screen is due to
erosion, rather than coverage by carbon, the authors estimate the corresponding
influx in monopole configuration (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) to be Phi /sub
Be/SCREEN=1.16*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ from an effective area
A/sub EFF/=0.5 m/sup 2/. At the same coupling resistance the beryllium influx
scales with the RF power of the antenna and with the plasma density. With
dipoles (k/sub II/=7 m/sup -1/), the influx is reduced by more than a factor 3.
The contribution of antenna influxes to Z/sub eff/ is small, Delta Z/sub
eff//sup Be/=0.08 and Delta Z/sub eff//sup Ni/=0.05 at P/sub RF/=5 MW.<p>

Abstract: JET has always been operated with graphite limiters. Carbonisation
has been performed from time to time resulting in a temporary reduction of
Z/sub eff/. However, the latest results at high power (up to 30 MW) indicate
that in most cases the impurity content in the plasma is too large to reach
near reactor conditions. To reduce the impurity content to a level acceptable
in a reactor, it is proposed to use beryllium as a material for the limiters
and wall surfaces in JET. This proposal was first made four years ago on the
basis of a report comparing the relative merits of beryllium and carbon. The
effects of impurities on the plasma performance are discussed. The physical and
chemical properties of graphite and beryllium are compared. A simple model for
the impurity production at the plasma edge is presented.<p>

in-vessel components (carbon limiters, nickel screen, inconel walls). Immediate
and lasting improvements of the plasma have been observed in all plasma
regimes. The authors concentrate on the results obtained with ICRH and NBI on
the density limit and on H-mode plasmas which are particularly sensitive to
impurity release. Specific effects produced by RF waves are reduced to a
negligible level when the following 3 aspects are combined: beryllium
evaporation, dipole phasing and correct screen angle. The density limit
obtained with ICRF is now identical to NBI heated cases and substantially
higher than the values obtained in the pre-beryllium phase. Long H-modes (1.3
s) have been obtained with RF alone. The H mode confinement is similar to that
of NBI cases. In limiter plasmas Z/sub eff/ decreased to 1.2-1.4 at high
density and for 10 MW input power. The results are related to oxygen gettering,
suppression of nickel sputtering from the antenna screens and to the use of
dipole phasing.<p>

Abstract: Summarizes results from the initial operation of the JET Tokamak with
a beryllium first wall. JET was first operated with an evaporated Be coating on
the walls and graphite limiters in June 1989. In August the graphite limiter
tiles were replaced with Be tiles, and a three week experimental campaign was
conducted in September/October. In the first phase oxygen was reduced to a
negligible level and the carbon flux halved. In the second phase, for limiter
mode operation, carbon was reduced by another factor of five, and Be became the
dominant impurity. High power, long pulse additionally heated limiter mode
discharges with Z/sub eff/&lt;1.5 were achieved, and density limits were
increased by a factor of up to two. ICRF produced H-modes were obtained in
X-point operation (double null). The combination of Be gettering with new
operational procedures to delay the strong influx of carbon from the X-point
tiles enabled the achievement of record fusion parameters in H-mode discharges
including a transient n/sub d/T/sub i/ tau /sub E/ value of 9*10/sup 20/ m/sup
-3/ keVs, corresponding to a Q/sub DT/ equivalent of about 0.8.<p>

Abstract: A variety of materials have been used in JET for wall protection and
high heat flux components. The machine initially operated with metallic walls,
but the inner surface of the vessel ( approximately 200 m/sup 2/) is now
covered to more than 50% with fine grain and carbon fibre reinforced graphite
tiles. The remaining wall area is carbonized. The authors present the materials
behaviour in the presence of plasma; their influence on plasma properties; the
conditioning methods employed; a discussion of future enhancements of inner
wall components and the planned use of beryllium as an alternative to the
present concept of an all graphite machine. It is essential for the further
development of fusion that the experience gained in JET is transferred to the
next machine, which should produce a burning plasma on a scale comparable to a
reactor. Such a proposed machine is a single null divertor tokamak with the
following parameters: 3 m plasma minor radius, 7.5 m major radius, elongation
approximately 2, aspect ratio approximately 2.5, toroidal field, 4.5 T, pulse
duration 2000 s and fusion power up to 5 GW. The underlying physics for the
choice of these parameters and the basic design is presented.<p>

Abstract: During Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating in JET
(Joint European Torus) with beryllium gettered walls and RF antenna screens
both the global and local impurity influxes are significantly reduced as
compared to the previous operation. In particular oxygen is reduced by an order
of magnitude and the deuterium is efficiently pumped. The deuterium recycling
R/sub D/&lt;1 except at the onset of the RF pulse (1&lt;R/sub D/&lt;1.1) for
t=0.75 s, indicating modest desorption. This provides the density control.
Except for the lowest densities, Z/sub eff/=2 at P/sub RF/=10 MW is routinely
achieved. At comparable densities, P/sub RAD//P/sub TOT/ is 30-50% lower. If
one assumes that the long term evolution of the beryllium signal at the antenna
screen is due to erosion, rather than coverage by carbon, one estimates the
corresponding influx in the monopole configuration (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) to
be Phi /sub Be//sup SCREEN/=1.16*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ from an
effective area A/sub EFF/=0.5 m/sup 2/. At the same coupling resistance the
beryllium influx scales with the RF power of the antenna and with the plasma
density. With dipoles (k/sub II/=7 M/sup -1/), the influx is reduced by more
than a factor of 3. The contribution of antenna influxes to Z/sub eff/ is
small, Delta Z/sub eff//sup Be/=0.08 and Delta Z/sub eff//sup Ni/=0.05 at P/sub
RF/=5 MW.<p>

Abstract: An investigation of the scrape-off layer (SOL) at different poloidal
positions have been carried out with Langmuir probes for limiter discharges
with ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) at JET. Comparison of the effects
of ICRH on the edge is presented for operation with all carbon limiters, and
for operation with a beryllium layer evaporated on the walls and limiters of
JET. The behaviour of the SOL parameters is similar for both cases, although
edge temperatures tend to be lower in the Be case. Measurements with probes
between the belt limiters and close to the ICRH antennas show that the edge
parameters in this region are strongly influenced by the vicinity of an active
antenna.<p>

Abstract: Results from the initial operation of the JET tokamak (Plasma Physics

Abstract: JET is investigating beryllium as material for walls and limiters.
Studies were carried out with initially a thin layer of beryllium evaporated
onto the walls of the machine, later in addition the graphite material of the
belt limiter was exchanged against beryllium. The use of this material was
generally beneficial for the plasma behaviour. Combined with a reduction in the
oxygen content, strong pumping of hydrogen isotopes was found which allowed JET
to widen considerably the operational space with respect to ion temperatures,
densities and plasma purity. In this paper a comparison of the plasma
performance with graphite and beryllium will be presented. The author discusses
especially the impurity behaviour with respect to fluxes, concentrations,
effective charge and dilution, and reports on density limits, disruption
behaviour, wall pumping, hydrogen isotope retention, and the power handling
capability of the beryllium limiter in the present design. Examples of improved
plasma performance are given.<p>

Abstract: The 1989 JET experimental campaign assessed the properties of
beryllium as a plasma-facing material. This campaign had three phases: (i) an
all-graphite phase to recommission the tokamak, (ii) a phase with beryllium
evaporation on graphite to isolate the effect of oxygen gettering and (iii) a
beryllium limiter phase. Beryllium evaporation removed oxygen from the plasma
and reduced carbon concentrations by a factor of two. Strong deuteron pumping
was obtained which resulted in a significant, long-term improvement in density
control and eliminated the deconditioning effect of disruptions. The use of
beryllium limiters reduced the plasma radiation, increased the density limit,
reduced the incidence of disruptions and enhanced the deuteron pumping. In the
beryllium phases impurity influxes were lower during ICRH heating which
permitted the first ICRH-only H-modes. The deuteron pumping allowed heavy gas
fuelling to be used to reduce impurity levels of limiter and X-point plasmas.<p>

Abstract: During high-power operation in JET, a sudden and large increase in
the flux of impurities (carbon and beryllium) entering the discharge is often
observed shortly after the start of additional heating, especially at the low
plasma density required for high ion temperature and fusion yield. This influx
leads to a degradation of the plasma performance due to an increase of the
impurity concentration and associated deuterium dilution, reduced beam
penetration and a reduction in the ion temperature. There is good evidence that
these influxes result from a small fraction of the total area of the carbon
(beryllium) surfaces in contact with the plasma (tile edges particularly)
reaching temperatures where radiation-enhanced sublimation and thermal
sublimation for carbon and evaporation for beryllium become important. The
authors report on measurements of the phenomena observed during inner-wall and
carbon or beryllium belt limiter discharges both with and without beryllium
gettering.<p>

Abstract: Deuterium recycling during and after ohmic limiter discharges in the
Be-phase of JET are compared with that during the C-phase. For the Be-phase,
effective transport parameters for diffusion and recombination of deuterium at
surfaces of in-vessel components of JET are derived using plasma discharge data
only. This and the analysis of the outgassing behaviour after the discharge
suggest that deuterium release is controlled by recombination with D/k (D is
the diffusion, k the recombination coefficient) of about 10/sup 21/-10/sup 22/
m/sup -2/, larger than expected from laboratory measurements.<p>

Abstract: Scaling of edge particle flux and temperature with central density in
JET has been studied in ohmic and auxiliary heated beryllium limiter
discharges, using Langmuir probes in the edge. Data has been obtained over a
much wider density range than previously, and it is found that flux density
scales almost linearly with central density. The edge temperature, on the other
hand, is almost constant at low densities, but falls rapidly when gas puffing
is used in the edge to achieve high densities. A global power balance assuming
T/sub i/=T/sub e/ suggests a shortfall in power to the edge, particularly at
low densities, suggesting T/sub i/&gt;T/sub e/. The consequence of high T/sub
i/ on limiter sputtering is considered.<p>

Abstract: During 1989, following a brief all carbon phase, JET was operated
with an evaporated beryllium film on all the plasma facing surfaces and then,
in a third phase, with bulk beryllium used for the belt limiters and one set of
antenna protection tiles. Subsequent analysis of wall components and long term
samples (LTS) using beta backscatter and ion beam analysis has been conducted
to determine the condition of the first wall and its deuterium inventory after
beryllium operation. Ex-situ analysis of components where deposition occurs
during operation shows mixed carbon and beryllium layers with an approximate
ratio 1:1 and some localised higher Z components. The deuterium inventory
situation is little changed by the introduction of beryllium. Similar surface
levels of deuterium, approximately 1*10/sup 22/ atoms m/sup -2/, have been seen
for both carbon and beryllium belt limiter tiles.<p>

Abstract: During ICRF heating in JET with Be gettering and Be-belt limiters the
impurity influxes are significantly reduced as compared to the all carbon case.
The dominating 'global' influxes originate at the limiters and wall and are
consequence of the increased power flow in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The 'RF
specific' influxes from the torus internal surfaces, far away from the antenna,
are not observed. Z/sub eff/=1.5-2 is routinely achieved at power levels up to
P/sub rf/=15 MW and with Be limiters even at densities (n/sub e/)=(1-2)*10/sup
19/ m/sup -3/. The dilution is n/sub d//n/sub e/&gt;0.8. Z/sub eff/ scales
inversely with density and weakly with RF power, (Z/sub eff/-1) varies as P/sub
RF//sup 0.4-0.6//(n/sub e/)/sup 0.9-1.1/. P/sub rad//P/sub tot/ is 50% lower
than previously observed. Even at densities (n/sub e/)=(4-6)*10/sup 19/ m/sup
-3/ the radiated fraction is below 30% of input power. In the case of Be
gettering and carbon limiters the dominant impurity is carbon. With the Be
limiters it is replaced by Be. The oxygen is eliminated in both cases. The
density is controlled by the pumping of deuterium and the recycling coefficient
R/sub d/ is less than one during the entire RF pulse. The density limit
observed in the all carbon phase was exceeded by a factor 2-4. Volume averaged
density (n/sub e/)=1*10/sup 20/ m/sup -3/ was achieved with gas puffing at
power P/sub RF/=8 MW.<p>

Abstract: The effect of different fuelling scenarios (gas fuelling and pellets)
on the scrape-off layer parameters is presented for ohmic and additionally
heated limiter discharges at JET, during operation with Be-coated carbon
limiters and all-Be limiters. The carbon and beryllium impurity production is
calculated using edge parameters measured with Langmuir probes, and compared
with the central impurity content (Z/sub eff/). The local particle diffusion
coefficient is also calculated. For all the different dynamic processes
studied, a correlation is found between electron edge temperature and edge
density, which does not depend on the fuelling or heating scenario used. A
cooling of the edge is observed with increasing edge density, and the impurity
production by sputtering decreases for edge temperatures below 20 eV. Strong
gas and pellet fuelling are found to be very efficient in controlling Z/sub
eff/.<p>

coupled to the plasma. Approximately 2-4% of the surface of the limiter has
been melted near the plasma contact point. Another 10-15% of the surface shows
evidence of edge heating. some 5% of tiles have been subjected to abnormal
loads at points distant from the contact area. Damage shows strong correlation
of localised heating of the toroidal field ripple. Edge heating rates of 260
Mw/m/sup 2/ have not caused gross mechanical failure of the limiter. The
mechanical damage comprises fatigue cracks analogous to those due to sustained
loading at low power levels.<p>

Abstract: The sputtering yields for deuterium on carbon and beryllium at the
belt limiters in JET are determined with an OMA spectrometer and/or
photomultiplier detectors with optical interference filters. The apparent
sputter yield for carbon in the absence of oxygen from 4-10%, and for beryllium
the yield from 6-30%. A CCD camera with optical interference filters has been
used to record the 2-D spatial distributions of the BeI (825.4 nm) line
radiation at the belt limiters. Clearly resolved individual tile images are
observed, and the dependence of the toroidal and poloidal impurity
distributions on plasma density and input power has been investigated.
Transport of the Be neutrals has been modelled with the LIM impurity code over
the plasma density range (0.35-2.50)*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/ for 3 MA ohmic
discharges, and good agreement with the experimental data has been obtained.<p>

Abstract: The authors report a study of the impurity influx from a carbon probe
that was introduced to the edge of the plasma in JET. The measured dependence
of carbon influx on surface temperature is compared with results from a model
of the plasma boundary. The spatial distribution, in the region around the
probe, of spectral emission from low ionisation stages of carbon are compared
with results from the Monte Carlo transport code, LIM. In both models, measured
values of local plasma parameters were used. In plasma with Be-gettered carbon
limiters, carbon influx from the probe increased rapidly when the surface
temperature exceeded 1200 degrees C. Experiments with beryllium metal limiter
showed that under these conditions, a layer of mainly beryllium was deposited
on the probe surface, and this suppressed the carbon influx until higher
surface temperatures were reached.<p>

Abstract: Provide experimental data on the recycling of hydrogen isotopes in
beryllium. The ratio D/2 K/sub r/(m/sup -2/) (D: diffusion coefficient, K/sub
r/: recombination rate coefficient), which characterises the hydrogen transient
pumping behaviour of the materials, has been measured for hydrogen and
deuterium in Be as a function of temperature, in the range
373&lt;or=T(K)&gt;or=553. D/2K/sub r/ was found to be approximately=10/sup 20/
m/sup -2/ and depend weakly on the Be temperature (activation energies of
approximately=0.1 eV). This value of D/2K/sub r/ was then used as an input
parameter to the PERI code to simulate the plasma deuterium inventory behaviour
assuming that the main processes governing the recycling during the discharge
are diffusion in the bulk and recombination on the surface of beryllium. The
deuterium fluxes from the plasma-facing surfaces are simulated with good
accuracy. The simulation of the deuterium plasma inventory is somewhat worse,
although a satisfactory agreement between the calculated experimental time
evolution is achieved.<p>

Abstract: Surface probes have been exposed at JET with all-carbon walls, when
beryllium was evaporated onto graphite limiters, and with beryllium limiters.
The aims have been to study the impurity content in the scrape-off, erosion and
deposition, and the pumping of deuterium by codeposition with carbon and
beryllium. Thermally activated erosion makes it difficult to study time
resolved erosion close to the LCFS. In the all-carbon machine, the carbon
density in the outboard scrapeoff between the belts was estimated to
approximately 20% of the deuterium. With a fresh Be coating on the limiters,
carbon in the SOL was initially suppressed, but increased from discharge to
discharge. The D/C ratio in codeposition layers was three times larger with
Be-evaporation than in all-carbon conditions. Edge profiles determined from
impurity deposition became flatter during RF heating and current ramp down.<p>

Abstract: The evaporation of beryllium inside the JET (Joint European Torus)
has changed considerably the behavior of the machine and the plasma
performance. Recovery from disruption was fast and density control was easily
achieved. The operational space with respect to Z/sub eff/-values, dilution,
density, and temperature could be considerably extended. The dilution was
reduced and consequently the fusion parameter was doubled to 5*10/sup 20/ m/sup
-3/ keV. The equivalent Q/sub DT/-value, albeit nonstationary, approaches 0.5.
Beryllium tiles were installed on the belt limiter, requiring for the first
time an intervention into the vessel with full biological protection. The
control of the beryllium environment was successful and installation times did
not require more manhours than previously for in-vessel work. Experimental
results from operation with the beryllium limiter are not yet available.
Preliminary findings indicate the possibility of obtaining very low Z/sub
eff/-values (&lt;1.3-1.8) for additionally heated discharges. Energies of up to
180 MJ were deposited on the limiter, twice the amount which can be taken by
the graphite limiter before the occurrence of the carbon bloom. At the edges of
the beryllium limiter tiles, hot spots develop (as was also observed for the
graphite).<p>

first wall material. Over 200 hours operational experience with such an
evaporator had been gained on a test bed facility in which the evaporation
rate, radial evaporant distribution and head operating temperature had been
determined. The results obtained on this facility with two different head
materials, sintered S-65B and vacuum cast beryllium are described. The test
vessel has also been used to conduct beryllium wall pumping experiments using
the 'Langmuir effect'. The initial results of these experiments are
described.<p>

Comparisons of the current decay during carbon-bounded and beryllium bounded
disruptions in JET.<p>
JET Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, Dec. 1990.<p>
Pub type:  Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: Presents results of preliminary investigations of the current decay
phase in JET major disruptions, where the plasma is bounded by beryllium
limiters and a beryllium gettered wall. The average decay time of the current
is 175 ms, about 14 times longer than the initial decay time for carbon-bonded
disruptions. Vertical stability is often lost before the current has decayed
significantly in Be-bounded disruptions, leading to substantial net vertical
forces on the vacuum vessel. Subsequent interaction of the plasma with the top
or bottom divertor tiles leads to increased impurity contamination, cooling of
the plasma and a second phase of more rapid current decay. No runaway current
plateau is observed for carbon-bounded x-point disruptions, although in some
cases a small hesitation in the current decay is observed that is coincident
with the hard X-ray and photoneutron signals associated with runaway electrons.
The total photoneutron yield in x-point disruptions is at least 10 times
smaller than that measured from limiter discharges. Both x-point and limiter
disruptions in Be-bounded discharges show no runaway production, except for a
few cases where carbon contamination is also suspect. Direct ECE measurements
indicate the temperature T/sub d/ following thermal quench in Be-bounded
disruptions is at least 30 eV, and often higher. Plasmas of such temperatures
have resistive decay times consistent with the observed current decay rates.
The lack of runaway production is also consistent with these temperatures as,
for n/sub e/=1*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/, the runaway production rate for T/sub
d/=30 eV is estimated to be a factor 10/sup -6/ less than that at 5 eV. Even
greater reductions are estimated for higher densities.<p>

Assessment of beryllium Faraday screens of the JET ICRF antennas. JET<p>
Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, July 1991.<p>
Pub type:  Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: The installation of beryllium (Be) Faraday screens (FS) at the ICRF
antennas in JET resulted in elimination of the RF specific effects on the
plasma boundary by the impurity influx originating at the screens. In dipole
phasing, k/sub II/=7 m/sup -1/, the influx is for all purposes negligible. In
monopole (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) the beryllium influx does not exceed phi /sub
Be//sup FS/=1*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ and corresponding delta
Z/sub eff//P/sub RF/&lt;0.005 MW/sup -1/. The observed dependences of the phi
/sub Be//sup FS/ (in monopole phasing) on plasma density, antenna voltage,
antenna phasing and the angle between FS elements and the magnetic field in the
boundary B(a)=B/sub theta /(a)+B/sub T/(a) confirm that the release mechanism
is the sputtering by the ions accelerated in the RF-enhanced Bohm-Debye sheaths
forming at the front face of the FS. When the angle between FS and the B(a) is
approximately=22 degrees the fraction of the RF power radiated by the antenna,
dissipated at the screen, can reach 40%. At high antenna voltage arcing across
the FS can occur. With dipole phasing the heating efficiency is not degraded
even with the large angle and all the power coupled by the antenna is absorbed
at the resonance position near the plasma centre. The open screen design did
not introduce any disadvantages. The experience from the JET operation at
powers up to 22 MW shows that, if the necessary conditions are met, i.e., RF
rectification is minimised and material with the low sputtering coefficients at
energies 0.5-1 keV is used, then the influx from the FS is eliminated.<p>

Abstract: The JET ICRF antennas, equipped with beryllium (Be) Faraday screens
(FS), can be operated in such a way that the RF specific effects on the plasma
boundary, by the impurity influx originating at the screens, are reduced to a
negligible level. In dipole phasing, k/sub ///=7 m/sup -1/, the influx is for
all purposes negligible. In monopole phasing (k/sub ///=0 m/sup -1/) the
beryllium influx does not exceed phi /sub Be//sup FS/=1*10/sup 19/ atoms.MW/sup
-1/.s/sup -1/ and the corresponding delta Z/sub eff//P/sub RF /is &lt;0.005
MW/sup -1/. The observed dependences of phi /sub Be//sup FS/ (in monopole
phasing) on plasma density antenna voltage, antenna phasing, and the angle
between FS elements and the magnetic field in the boundary, B(a)=B/sub theta
/(a)+B/sub T/(a), confirm that the release mechanism is sputtering by ions
accelerated in the RF enhanced Bohm-Debye sheaths forming at the front face of
the FS. When the angle between FS and B(a) is approximately=22 degrees , the
fraction of the RF power radiated by the antenna, dissipated at the screen, can
reach 40%. At high antenna voltage, arcing across the FS can occur. With dipole
phasing the heating efficiency is not degraded, even with the large angle, and
all the power coupled by the antenna is absorbed at the resonance position near
the plasma centre. The open screen design did not introduce any disadvantages.
The experience from JET operation at powers of up to 22 MW shows that, if the
necessary conditions are met, i.e. if RF rectification is minimized, antennas
are phased as dipoles and material with low sputtering coefficients at energies
of 0.5-1 keV is used, then the influx from the FS is, for all practical
purposes, eliminated.<p>

Beryllium safety at JET.<p>

Abstract: The measures detailed in the 'Code of Practice for the Safe use of
Beryllium at JET' are summarized. JETs (Joint European Torus') policy of
segregating beryllium related work into BeCAs (beryllium controlled areas) has
ensured that the general workplace (torus hall, assembly hall, etc.) remain
free of airborne and surface contamination, and hence no safety precautions
have had to be adopted in these areas. There have been no beryllium incidents
leading to airborne concentrations in excess of 0.2 mu gm/sup -3/ outside of
any BeCA. Aerial discharges of beryllium have generally been undetectable and
have never approached the limit of 0.01 mu gm/sup -3/. No cases of acute or
chronic beryllium intoxication have been diagnosed; some minor cuts have been
sustained in BeCAs (no contamination of the wound was found on samples) and no
treatment has been required beyond conventional first-aid procedures. In-vessel
work has continued to be possible despite high levels of surface contamination
and variable air concentrations, but the logistics support for in-vessel
operation has increased very noticeably as a result of beryllium.<p>

Abstract: The dependence of impurity production and retention on the divertor
density, on the power flow into this region as well as on the X-point to target
distance are investigated. Model predictions suggest a good impurity retention
above a certain divertor (scrape-off) density threshold, which is dependent on
heating power. Pre-programmed midplane or X-point gas puffs were used to scan
the density, as well as to avoid the depletion of particles form the divertor
and the scrape-off during H-modes. The gas puffs reduce T/sub e/ and increase
N/sub e/ in particular at the outer strike zone. In general the Be as well as
the C influx increases with density, which is understood from the T/sub
e/(T/sub i/) dependence of the sputtering yields. The impurity retention shows
the expected improvement with increasing scrape-off (divertor) density as well
as with increasing X-point to target distance (connection length).<p>

Abstract: The radial distributions of the low charge states of Be near the JET
beryllium belt limiters have been measured experimentally. When interpreted
with an impurity production/transport code, these measurements elucidate the
plasma behaviour near the limiter, and the source and sink action of the
limiter on the impurity ions. The authors have considered 3 MA ohmically
heated, limiter discharges with n/sub e/=1-4*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/. A model
which satisfactorily reproduces the measured profiles required the following
assumptions: (a) an n/sub e/(r) profile just inside the LCFS (0 to
approximately 10 cm radially inwards) which extrapolated smoothly from the SOL
(probe) measurements; (b) a T/sub e/(r) outer edge profile which extrapolated
smoothly from the core (ECE) measurements; (c) a cross-field impurity diffusion
coefficient D/sub perpendicular to / approximately= 0.5 m/sup 2//s in the outer
edge; (d) no strong inward or outward pinch action in the outer edge; (e)
impurity production by physical sputtering, rather than by evaporation; (f)
sputtering due to parallel plasma flow onto the limiters; no significant direct
perpendicular flow onto the limiters, as has been observed for larger
limiters.<p>

Abstract: The 1991/92 JET experimental campaign assessed the performance of
three different toroidally continuous X-point target plates. The main
differences were in the tile material, beryllium and carbon, and the presence
of exposed edges. These three configurations have been tested up to power
levels in excess in 22 MW and with gas fuelling at the X-point and in the
midplane. With the beryllium a radiating divertor was achieved by puffing
deuterium into the X-point region, while rapid ELMs resulted from deuterium
puffing on the carbon target. The investigation into the importance of small
edges, up to 1.5 mm, yielded some interesting results. Although the surface
temperature rise was substantially reduced by eliminating exposed tile edges,
the onset of the carbon bloom was not delayed by a similar amount. In this
paper a model is presented which can explain this and other features of the
bloom.<p>

Analysis of outgassing after JET-discharges under beryllium first wall
conditions.<p>
JET Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, July 1992.<p>
Pub type:  Practical; Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: During the beryllium phase of JET, hydrogen (H/sub 2/, HD, D/sub 2/),
hydrocarbon (C/sub x/H/sub y/) and CO outgassing after discharges has been
analysed by means of mass spectroscopy and Penning gauges. The analysis has
been performed over a period of up to 3000 seconds after ohmic and additionally
heated limiter and X-point discharges. The temporal behaviour of hydrogenic
outgassing could be characterized by a uniform power law t/sup -n/ with
n=0.73+or-0.1 which is independent of plasma operation parameters. This result
is discussed in view of possible transport and retention mechanisms in and
deuterium release mechanisms from plasma facing surfaces. It is concluded that
not a single but several mechanisms can explain the release behaviour. However,
one of the most plausible explanations is accumulation of hydrogen in limiters
and walls. Outgassing of hydrocarbon and CO were significantly lower under
beryllium wall conditions as compared to the earlier all carbon wall
conditions.<p>

Abstract: Single null X-point discharges having exactly the same main plasma
parameters were performed on the C and on the Be target tiles in order to
compare the two materials under similar conditions. Low power L-mode, H-mode
and hot-iron H-mode pulses were used in this comparison. The impurity
production when using a Be target is a factor of 3 higher than at the C target
under similar plasma conditions. The power handling capability of Be is
approximately a factor of 1.5 lower than that of C. In radiative divertor (gas
target) experiments, however, Be seems to be superior to C. This may be due to
the fact that the maximum Be radiation occurs at a plasma temperature of 1.5 eV
compared with 7 eV in the case of C.<p>

Abstract: After plasma operation in 1991 samples were cut from C and Be tiles
of the JET vessel walls, limiters, and X-point tiles along a poloidal cross
section in octant 4W, and the surface layers were analysed by the MeV ion beam
methods NRA, PIXE, and RBS to determine the D and metal impurity distributions.
The amount of trapped deuterium ranges from 5*10/sup 15/ to 5*10/sup 17/
D/cm/sup 2/, metal impurities such as Ni, Cr, and Fe are in the range of 10/sup
15/ to 3*10/sup 16//cm/sup 2/, Cl in the range of 10/sup 16/ to 10/sup
18//cm/sup 2/, K and Ca in the range of 10/sup 15/ to 10/sup 16//cm/sup 2/ and
Ti about 10/sup 15//cm/sup 2/. Except for Cl, all measured concentrations are a
factor of up to about ten lower than those observed on JET walls tiles before
Be evaporation and Be wall components were used. This observation is in
agreement with the reduced impurity concentrations measured in the JET plasma.
The D and impurity distributions along the X-point tiles were analysed in some
detail. Generally, the deuterium trapping and impurity deposition show minima
in areas where erosion dominates and amounts to a factor of about ten times
larger inbetween.<p>

Abstract: A long pulse JET divertor requires the production of beryllium clad
copper alloy hypervapotron target plates. Vacuum brazing of beryllium poses a
number of problems relating to the stable beryllium oxide and ready formation
of brittle intermetallics. Induction brazing offers some advantages and a rig
has been developed for producing vapotron test target plates for power load
testing in the Neutral Beam Test Bed. The brazed components have survived over
1000 shots at 13 MW/m/sup 2/ with an ultimate power loading capability up to 17
MW/m/sup 2/. These results have been interpreted with respect to both localised
stresses and thermal fatigue at the interface. This study analyses the power
handling capability with respect to instantaneous heat flux failure, localised
hot spots from target plate deflections and high cycle fatigue with a view to
establishing an optimum unit size.<p>

Abstract: Since the introduction of beryllium (Be) into the JET machine in 1989
the occupational hygiene screening for Be contamination has been a key feature
of JET health physics tasks. Beryllium dust is toxic and if inhaled can result
in severe acute and chronic conditions which have been well documented.
Techniques to rapidly assess Be contamination have been investigated. A laser
induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) system, in which a laser is used to
vapourise Be from a filter paper prior to analysis was found to be inaccurate
due to particle size differences between the calibration and JET samples. A
prototype on-line sampler although rapid was found to be insufficiently
sensitive. The lack of a practical direct monitoring method for assessing JET
Be contamination complicates the procedures required for the safe handling of
the material. The requirements of the UK Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations have necessitated the provision of on-site Be analysis
facilities to provide the information necessary to protect the work force and
demonstrate compliance with these regulations. The technique described here
involves the dissolution of filter paper samples bearing Be dust in sulphuric
and nitric acids and the analysis of the resulting liquor by atomic absorption
spectrometry and is recommended by the UK Health and Safety Executive as
suitable for assessing personnel exposure to Be.<p>
