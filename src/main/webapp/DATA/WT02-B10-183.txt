In 1994, the Department of Neuroscience underwent a significant reorganization that greatly heightened its multidisciplinary approach to psychiatric research, integrating psychology, psychiatry, pharmacology, and basic neuroscience in order to examine the biological substrate of mental illness at multiple levels. The department comprises three divisions to pursue the application of postmortem and in vivo studies of psychiatric disorders. The Division of Neurochemistry develops laboratory probes for clinical studies of the serotonergic and other monoamine systems, and organizes clinical studies. The Division of Neuropathology conducts postmortem brain studies and provides neuropathology services to the Office of Mental Health. The Division of Brain Imaging conducts functional and structural brain imaging studies.

The major area of investigation for the Division of Neurochemistry has been the biological basis of suicidal behaviors. Dr. John Mann is the Director of the NIMH-funded Clinical Research Center for the Study of Suicidal Behavior. The Center supports a range of studies into the risk factors for suicidal behavior. Dr. Barbara Stanley and Dr. Ronald Winchel are conducting neurochemical and psychological investigations in individuals who manifest impulsive self-injury and trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling). Drs. John Mann and Kevin Malone have developed methods using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for visualizing regional brain responses to serotonin activation. This technique allows identification of high risk patients and the localization of regional brain abnormalities in high-risk patients. Other studies are in progress examining possible genetic influences on the manifestation of suicidal and other self-harming behaviors. In collaboration with <BR>
Dr. Conrad Gilliam, a candidate gene approach has been adopted, focused on key serotonin-related genes. Dr. Bruce Parsons has a NARSAD award to continue his work on the autoradiographic analysis of dopamine receptors and uptake sites in postmortem tissues both from adults and adolescents who have committed suicide.

Dr. Stephen Karpiak and Heljo Laev continue to detail the CNS injury cascade that occurs with excitotoxic (glutamate) damage. Using cortical and spinal cell cultures, they have described the sequelae of plasma membrane pathology associated with trauma and excitotoxic injury, and found the lipid GM1 to be an effective neuroprotective agent against such injuries. In a collaborative effort with Dr. B. L. Hungund, they have reported similar findings when studying acute alcohol toxicity.

Dr. Tamir and her associates are continuing their work on secretogogue-induced gating of chloride channels in the secretory vesicles of parafollicular cells (PF). They have shown that PF cells of the thyroid have features of both neurons and endocrine cells. Thyroid PF cells are neural cres-derived endocrine cells that secrete serotonin and calcitonin. The function of secretory vesicles in neurons is important for neurotransmission and, therefore, for disease and therapeutics.

Dr. Mark Underwood conducts research into the regulation of regional cerebral blood flow by the serotonergic system. The coupling of metabolism and blood flow is a fundamental assumption governing the interpretation of functional brain imaging studies using blood flow as a guide to neuronal activity. Dr. Underwood is one of the few scientists studying the validity of this assumption.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Enormous technical advances have allowed the use of brain imaging techniques to be applied to the study of neurotransmitter systems in both postmortem and living brain. Dr. Underwood has spearheaded the laboratory, applying these techniques to postmortem brain studies.

In postnatal mesolimbic cultures, Drs. Rayport and Sulzer have pursued studies of the synaptic physiology and psychopharmacology of mesolimbic neurons. They have found that glutamate may be a cotransmitter in mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Pursuing their weak base mechanism of amphetamine action, they have directly monitored amphetamine-induced dopamine release in real time and further confirmed the model. Using fluorophobes, they have shown that dopamine receptor subtypes are frequently colocalized on nucleus accumbens neurons. Finally, they have found that methamphetamine neurotoxicity involves an intracellular free radical mechanism.

Dr. Stephen Rayport received a five-year award from the NIH, a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Scholar Award in Experimental Therapeutics, and a two-year award from the Scottish Rite for schizophrenia research.

The Division of Neuropathology conducts basic and clinical research, participates in postgraduate medical education, and operates the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) Central Reference Laboratory (CRL) in Neuropathology. The Neuropathology division examines the brains of OMH patients obtained at autopsy. Drs. Andrew Dwork and Mavis Kaufman, in collaboration with Dr. Isak Prohovnik of the Division of Brain Imaging, have continued their studies of senile degenerative changes in schizophrenia. One achievement of this project has been to catalogue several thousand brains collected by the division. This collection, started in the preneuroleptic era, is now being studied with modern neuropathologic techniques.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Dwork has continued structural and functional studies of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, with particular attention to the interactions of these receptors with neuroleptic drugs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Victoria Arango, in collaboration with Drs. Mark Underwood, Andrew Dwork, Bruce Parsons, Victor Arkhipov, and John Mann, is conducting a program of postmortem studies of suicide victims utilizing a combination of quantitative receptor autoradiography, in situ hybridization histochemistry, and morphometry of brain stem nuclei. A parallel set of postmortem studies are being conducted by the same investigators in alcoholics in order to determine the neurochemical and morphological consequences of acute and chronic alcohol consumption.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Jonathan Javitch has worked in collaboration with Dr. Arthur Karlin of the Center for Molecular Recognition to map the binding sites for antipsychotic drugs in dopamine D2-like receptors. They have expressed human D2 receptors in cultured cells and are localizing the site of interaction of a photoaffinity-labeled drug with the receptor. This approach will be extended to D3 and D4 receptors to compare and contrast the binding sites for typical and atypical antipsychotics. Dr. Javitch has also demonstrated the existence of reduced cysteine residues near the binding site of the D2 receptor and is identifying the role of these cysteines using a combination of protein chemistry and site-directed mutagenesis.

Dr. Andrew Dwork was successful in receiving funding from NIMH on "Effects of Education and Occupation on Synaptic Density," and from the Smokeless Tobacco Research Council. Dr. Javitch is supported by a Scientist Development Award from NIMH. Drs. Arango and Mann are supported by multiyear grants from NIMH and NIDA for the postmortem human brain research. Drs. Bruce Parsons and Avi Molcho have NARSAD awards for postmortem neurochemical studies of suicide.

The Division of Brain Imaging has begun a transition from the use of the 133Xe rCBF method to the use of SPECT and PET. NIH-funded projects include Dr. Devanand's study of blood flow in early cases of suspected dementia using SPECT, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with Dr. Solomon using 133Xe, and a new study of sickle-cell disease, directed by Dr. Prohovnik, that is part of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center of Columbia University, under the direction of Dr. S. Piomelli. Work with functional magnetic resonance has begun. The new high field strength research group is bringing the five Tesla magnet on line.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major technological project to be finished this year includes the establishment of software to do PET image analysis of activation studies and volumetric analysis of MRI. Other funded projects are: a study of cerebral Lyme disease by Dr. Brian Fallon, a study of cerebral blood flow responses to anger by Dr. Peter Shapiro, and a study of cerebral blood flow responses to mood change by Dr. Eric Rubin. PET projects involve studies by Drs. Kevin Malone and John Mann on the serotonergic responsivity in major depression and the relation to suicide risk.
