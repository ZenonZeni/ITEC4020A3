<I>The next time you eat a black olive, think of this story.  Like many other 


foods you buy in the supermarket, black olives are processed before they are 


shipped. The current processing method generates millions of gallons of liquid 


waste that contains not only olive pits and parts, but also a high concentration of 


salts.  The waste poses an expensive disposal problem that some experts say 


threatens the U.S. olive industry. Oberti Olives in Madera, California, is an 


example. Oberti used evaporative ponds to hold its wastewater.  State officials 


said the ponds were leaking, contaminating underground water.  Industry-wide, 


such contamination could cause salt to spread through fresh water supplies, 


making them unfit for irrigation. Oberti found it would cost $40 million to reline its 


ponds, an expense it could not afford.  The company faced a choice: close down 


or find a new solution.  Now, with the help of a $400,000 grant from DOE's NICE3 


program, matched by $7 million from the food industry and $16,000 from the 


State of California, Oberti is demonstrating an innovative "membrane" filtration 


technology that removes salt and other contaminants from its wastewater, 


allowing 80% of the water, a total of 800,000 gallons a day, to be recycled.  The 


other 20% contains useable byproducts, including olive pomace (pits and other 


material) that will be used as animal feed.  Experts believe the new membrane 


system will also clean up wastewater from processing sugar, potatoes, tomatoes, 


carrots and peas.  Thus, a small DOE grant, a public/private partnership and a 


high-tech membrane are saving energy, water and jobs in the food processing 


industry.</I>


<P>


American industries need capital to grow, to help their workers obtain new skills, 


and to invest in new technologies and production capabilities.  Yet industries 


spend enormous amounts of capital on energy and pollution control.  Isn't there 


a better way?


<P>


There is.  A growing number of industries are discovering that energy efficiency 


and renewable energy technologies can lower costs, increase productivity and 


prevent pollution.


<P>


The Office of Industrial Technologies helps industries develop and adopt these 


new technologies through programs that have produced more than $2 in 


economic benefits for every $1 in Federal spending.  The Office has invested 


$965 million in Federal funds, which have produced more than $1.3 billion in 


energy savings for American industries plus more than $1.2 billion in increased 


capital productivity.  These programs helped increase employment in the 


industrial sector by more than 16,000 person-years in 1993.<P>


<P>


<B>Fiscal Year 1997 Highlights</B>


<P>


<I>Energy for Today</I>


<P>


The Office operates four partnership programs: NICE<sup>3</sup>, Motor Challenge, 


Climate Wise and the Industrial Assessment Center program.


<P>


<B>NICE<sup>3</sup> </B>(National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, 


Environment and Economics) awards grants to industry and state partnerships 


for projects that demonstrate advances in energy efficiency and clean production 


technologies.  The 47 projects currently funded by NICE<sup>3</sup> are leveraged with 


industry funds, resulting in the co-investment of $5 for every $1 of Federal 


funding.  The Fiscal Year 1997 budget will fund approximately 30 additional 


projects.


<P>


Electric motors and motor-driven systems such as fans, pumps, compressors 


and blowers consume more than half of all the electricity generated in the United 


States.  The <B>Motor Challenge </B>program works with industry, motor/drive 


manufacturers, distributors and others to inform companies about energy-


efficient electric motor system technology. The goal is to capture more than $590 


million in energy savings by the year 2000.  Motor Challenge has more than 


1,000 partners and last year reached more than 10,000 consumers through 


video conferencing and the program's information clearinghouse.  The Fiscal 


Year 1997 budget will provide technical assistance to the Industries of the 


Future program described below.


<P>


The <B>Climate Wise</B> program promotes industrial energy efficiency and 


pollution prevention.  Companies voluntarily pledge to reduce their greenhouse 


gas emissions.  By the end of 1995, more than 60 Climate Wise partners, 


representing 6% of U.S. industrial energy consumption, have committed to a 


reduction of 5 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by the year 2000.  By 


improving resource productivity, these partners are saving $80 million annually.  


The program has created partnerships with seven states. In Fiscal Year 1997, 


these partnerships will be expanded to 15 states.


<P>


The<B> Industrial Assessment Center</B> program offers no-cost energy and 


waste assessments to small and medium-sized manufacturers in 43 states.  The 


30 industrial assessment centers are operated out of universities by faculty and 


students who conduct the assessments and recommend improvements.  The 


centers perform 900 assessments per year.  The average assessment 


recommends improvements that could save the manufacturer $55,000 per year. 


The program returns $13 for every Federal dollar invested. The Fiscal Year 


1997 budget will allow the centers to conduct longer, two-day audits to provide 


pollution prevention and productivity recommendations.


<P>


<I>Energy for Tomorrow</I>


<P>


The<B> Industries of the Future</B> initiative is a fundamentally new 


approach to the development of industrial technology.  The initiative aligns 


Federal R&D with the needs of seven of the nation's most energy and 


waste-intensive industries: forest products, steel, metalcasting, aluminum, glass, 


chemicals and petroleum refining.  These industries are vital to the U.S. 


economy.  They employ 2.3 million people directly and provide the basic 


materials essential to the entire U.S. manufacturing sector.  At the same time, 


they account for 80% of the energy consumed and about 80% of the wastes 


generated in manufacturing.


<P>


Each participating industry creates a vision reflecting the dynamic impact of 


market, business, social and regulatory drivers in their sectors.  The vision 


provides a framework for shaping major advancements in technology.  DOE 


facilitates the process, then draws from the vision's menu of possibilities to 


shape a portfolio of near, medium, and long-term research, development and 


deployment activities.


<P>


This strategic planning also enhances productivity and reduces environmental 


compliance costs.  Current negotiations between the American Forest and Paper 


Association and the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, may result in 


substantially reduced compliance costs for air and water regulation--from $11.5 


billion down to $3-$4 billion.


<P>


By the end of Fiscal Year 1996, visions are expected to be completed for all 


seven target industries.  The Fiscal Year 1997 budget will increase funding for 


research in all seven industries to respond to needs identified in the vision 


process, such as sensors and controls for the forest products industry; recycling 


and environmental research for the steel industry; and advanced materials and 


improved energy and combustion technologies for the glass industry. 


<P>


<B>Benefits</B>


<P>


<B>Energy Savings</B>:  Reduce annual industrial end-use energy 


consumption by 0.6 quadrillion BTUs in 2000 and 2.0 quadrillion BTUs in 


2010.


<P>


<B>Cost Savings</B>:  Save $3 billion in direct energy costs annually by 2000 


and $11 billion by 2010 (in 1995 dollars).


<P>


<B>Pollution Prevention</B>:  Reduce annual emissions by the equivalent of 


14 million metric tons of carbon in 2000, and 43 million metric tons in 2010, with 


associated decreases in regulated air, water and toxic emissions.


<P>


<B>Market Profile:  Industrial Efficiency</B>


<P>


<MENU><LI>U.S. industry accounts for 25% of America's gross national product (GNP) 


and more than 25 million jobs.  Technologies that improve the productivity 


of U.S. industries improve the entire economy.<br>


<LI>Small and medium-sized manufacturers (employing 20 to 499 people) 


comprise about 64% of the overall manufacturing sector.  Typically, these 


firms do not have in-house expertise for pollution prevention or energy 


efficiency.


<LI>Industries consume 36% of the energy used in the U.S., at a cost of 


nearly $100 billion each year.  This level of energy use provides ample 


opportunities for savings.


<LI>Industries spend $45 billion per year to meet emissions control 


regulations.  Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can 


prevent pollution before it occurs, freeing industrial capital for more 


productive purposes.


<LI>The development of new U.S. pollution prevention technologies can help 


American businesses capture the growing world markets for 


environmental technologies.  That market is expected to reach $425 


billion annually by 1997.
