<P>The telecommunications, space and maritime industries we serve are subject
to a wide range of statutory and regulatory requirements established by a number
of administrative agencies and commissions, in a variety of jurisdictions both
within and outside the United States.  Our attorneys have broad experience in
assisting management and in-house counsel with respect to specific legal
problems encountered in complying with these numerous agencies and commissions
and their regulations, including strategic planning and the establishment of
policies and practices for regulatory compliance.  Many of the businesses we
serve cannot operate without first obtaining licenses, authorizations or permits
from such regulatory bodies. We specialize in obtaining such licenses,
authorizations and permits efficiently and quickly. </P>
<P>Changes in policies and regulations also can have profound effects on
businesses, either positive or negative.  We counsel businesses on how to
achieve constructive changes in regulations to enhance their operations and
represent businesses before regulators when changes in policies or regulations
will adversely affect their operations.  </P>
<P>The types of regulatory and administrative law services we undertake for
clients are described in the adjoining pages by both the subject and by the
agency involved.  To view a list of services arranged by subject matter, click

commissions, click here.{link to page 4.1.2  Each list is cross-referenced to
the other for your convenience.  </P>
