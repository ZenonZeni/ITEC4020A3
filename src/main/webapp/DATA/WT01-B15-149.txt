<TITLE>Letter to the Stakeholders Regarding the MPC</TITLE>
<BODY>
<NOBR><H1>Letter to Stakeholders


<br>from Dr. Daniel Dreyfus, OCRWM Director</H1></NOBR><hr>





Dear Stakeholder:


<p>


As part of the Department of Energy's (DOE) commitment to advise stakeholders of


programmatic activities, I am writing to inform you of a significant change in the Office of


Civilian Radioactive Waste Management plans for the upcoming year. The Fiscal Year 1996


appropriation significantly reduced program funding levels and necessitated that DOE


discontinue its proposal to fabricate and deploy a multi-purpose canister based system.  As a


result, DOE will cease preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a Multi-Purpose 


Canister System for Management of Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel.


<p>


As indicated in the enclosed <a href="../resource/fedreg/navyfr.htm">Federal Register notice</a>,  the Department of the Navy (Navy) will


become the lead agency and proceed with that part of the multi-purpose canister EIS covering


naval spent nuclear fuel.   The Navy's EIS is being renamed "The Department of the Navy


Environmental Impact Statement for a Container System for the Management of Naval Spent


Nuclear Fuel." DOE will participate as a cooperating agency since DOE is responsible for the


management of spent nuclear fuel derived from atomic energy defense activities, including that


from the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. 


<p>


The Navy plans to issue the Draft EIS by April 30, 1996.  Issuance of the Draft EIS will be


announced in the Federal Register.  A 45 day comment period will be provided following


issuance of the Draft EIS.  Public hearings will be held during the 45 day comment period.  The


locations and dates of these public hearings will be announced in the Federal Register when the


Draft EIS is issued.  The Navy plans to issue the final EIS by November 30, 1996, and plans to


issue a Record of Decision by December 31, 1996.


<p>


If you would like to receive a copy of the Navy's Draft EIS when it is completed, please provide


your address to: Argonne National Laboratory, EAD, Building 900, Mail Stop 1, 9700 South


Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439, ATTN: Naval Spent Fuel Container System EIS.


<p>


I hope this information has been of interest to you and I will continue to keep you abreast of


program changes in the months ahead.


<p>


Sincerely,


<p>


Daniel A. Dreyfus, Director


<br> 


Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
