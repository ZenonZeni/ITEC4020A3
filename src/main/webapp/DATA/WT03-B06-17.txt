MOUNTING TENSIONS

The centrist government of President Sanchez de Lozada will face
significant cross-pressures for the reminder of its term.  The
successor after the June 1997 elections is likely to be another
centrist regime led by someone from Sanchez de Lozada's National
Revolutionary Movement (MNR), but a victory by a right wing populist
is far from remote.  The commitment to free market policies that
calls for partial privatization of major state-owned industries, and
the reduction of the budget deficit will continue.  However,
pressures from labor and peasants will force more social spending.
In addition, the large role played by coca leaf growers and dealers
in the economy will prevent the strong action against the drug trade
encouraged by the US, which in turn could jeopardize aid and
financial support from the international community.  A right-wing
populist regime led by Carlos Palenque, a radio talk show host who
has significant support among the poor, would raise concerns among
investors about increased spending and a reversal of market reforms.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  BOLIVIA

April 12, 1995      Hundreds of striking teachers and miners, some
                    setting off dynamite and throwing rocks, fought
                    police in La Paz, continuing protests that had
                    left at least 30 people injured.  The strikers
                    have been demanding higher wages and protesting
                    educational and economic reforms.

 June 1995          Half-shares of Ende, the Bolivian state electric
                    company, were sold to foreign investors as a
                    first step in Sanchez de Lozadaas innovative
                    capitalization plan for modernizing state
                    enterprises and creating a pension fund for
                    Bolivians.

September-
October 1995        Sanchez de Lozadaas capitalization plan continued
                    as half-shares of LAB, the state airline, were
                    sold to foreign investors.

October 1995        State of siege resulting from spring strikes is
                    lifted.

December 1995       Max Fernandez dies in plane crash.
