<P>

Revised by R. K. Headland, Scott Polar Research Institute 13 May 1996, 
incorporating decisions of the XX Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting  .
<P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>


The Antarctic Treaty applies to the area south of 60&#176;
south latitude, including all islands and ice shelves.  The whole
area is subject  to  Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic
Flora and Fauna which are consolidated in the  Protocol  on Environmental
 Protection  to  the  Antarctic  Treaty.  These include prohibitions
on  the  killing,  wounding,  capturing  or molesting  of  any
native mammal or native bird except in accordance with a permit;
and regulations on the  importation  of exotic species, parasites,
and diseases.  Permits may be issued only by persons authorized
by a participating government.
<P>

Conservation areas follow legally binding measures adopted at
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ACTM), commonly
as a result of recommendations from the 
<A HREF="http://www.icair.iac.org.nz/treaty/scar/scar.html">Scientific 
Committee on Antarctic Research</A>.  
States belonging to the Treaty apply ACTM recommendations in 
order to control the activities of their own nationals.  Each new 
ACTM recommends  additions to  or  alterations  in the designation 
of certain areas.  The system aims to evolve in response to  
changing  perceptions and changing needs for conservation.
<P>
Six  categories  of  conservation  area have been designated:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#aa">Specially Protected Areas</A>  (SPA),  
<LI><A HREF="#bb">Sites of Special Scientific Interest</A>  (SSSI),  
<LI><A HREF="#cc">Historic Sites and Monuments</A> (HSM), 
<LI><A HREF="#dd">Specially Reserved Areas</A>  (SRA),  
<LI><A HREF="#ee">Multiple-use Planning  Areas</A> (MPA),  and  
<LI><A HREF="#ff">Ecosystem Monitoring Sites</A>.  
</UL>
Some areas designated under one category overlap or include areas  
in  another category. Management plans are required for all areas except
HSMs.
<P>
The 1991 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting recommended that
all SPAs and SSSIs should be redesignated as Antarctic Specially 
Protected Areas and be refereed and renumbered accordingly.
 However, the renaming and  renumbering has not yet been done.
 Entry into an ASPA will be prohibited except in accordance with
a permit.
<P>
A new category of protected areas is to be known as an <A
HREF="#hh">Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA)</A> to 
assist in the planning and  coordination  of  activities,  avoid  possible  
conflicts, improve  cooperation  between  Parties  or  minimize   adverse
environmental effects.  Entry into ASMAs will not require a permit.
<P>
Six <A HREF="#ii">Sealing  Zones</A> and three <A HREF="#jj">Seal
Reserves</A> have been established under the Convention for the 
Conservation  of Antarctic Seals. No areas have yet been set aside 
under provisions of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic 
Marine Living Resources  but two <A HREF="#ff">Ecosystem 
Monitoring Programme </A> sites have been designated.
<P>
 One <A HREF="##mm"> tomb </A>  was  declared  following  a
catastrophic aircraft impact.
<P>
All conservation areas are discussed in the <i>Handbook of the Antarctic 
Treaty System</i>, 8th edition, 1994. Subsequent  additions or amendments 
are from <i>Antarctic Treaty: Final Report of the XVIII Antarctic Treaty 
Consultative Meeting,  Kyoto,  11-15 April 1994</i> and <i>Antarctic  Treaty: 
Report of the Transitional Environmental Working Group, 
Seoul,  19  May  1995</i>,  and <i>Antarctic Treaty, Report of the XX 
Consultative Meeting, Den Haag, May 1996</i>.
<P>
There  are  similar  legally protected conservation areas designated
by national authorities  on  those  <A HREF="periant.htm">peri-Antarctic  
islands</A> outside the Antarctic Treaty region.  
These include:<UL>
<LI>the Prince Edward Islands, 
<LI>Iles Crozet, 
<LI>Iles Kerguelen, 
<LI>Heard  Island, 
<LI>Iles Saint-Paul et  Amsterdam,  
<LI>Macquarie  Island, 
<LI>Auckland Islands, 
<LI>Campbell Island,  
<LI>South  Georgia,  
<LI>South  Sandwich Islands, and 
<LI>Gough Island.
</UL>
<P>

These lists were originally compiled by Charles Swithinbank and
have been revised at the <A HREF="../home.htm">Scott 
Polar Research Institute</A>.
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="aa">Specially Protected Areas</A></H3>

The  purpose  of  SPAs  is to preserve both unique and representative
examples of the natural  ecological  systems  of  areas which
are  of outstanding scientific interest.  Vehicles of any kind
are forbidden.  Entry to an SPA is prohibited  without  a permit.
Permits may be issued only for a compelling scientific purpose
which cannot be served elsewhere.  The  collection
of any native plant or animal requires a further and more specific
permit.
<P>
1. Taylor Rookery, Mac. Robertson Land
<P>
67&#176;26'S, 60&#176;50'E.  Approximate area 0&#183;4
km2.  The area consists of the whole of the northernmost rock
exposure on the eastern side of Taylor Glacier.  Designated because
Taylor Rookery contains a colony of Emperor penguins which is
one of the few, and probably the largest, of the known colonies of this
species breeding wholly on land (see also SPA 8).
<P>

2. Rookery Islands, Holme Bay
<P>
67&#176;37'S, 62&#176;33'E, includes all the approximately
75 small islands within a rectangle centred on this point.  Approximate
area 30 km2.  Designated because of the unusual association of
all six bird species resident in the Mawson area.  The
southern giant petrel breeds nowhere else in the region.
<P>
3. Ardery Island and Odbert Island, Budd Coast
<P>
66&#176;22'S, 110&#176;28'E; and 66&#176;22'S, 110&#176;33'E.
 Approximate area 1&#183;9 km2.  The area lies off-shore in
Vincennes Bay, 13 km south of the former Wilkes Station.  Designated
because it supports several breeding species of petrel and provides
an example of their habitat.  Two of these species, the Antarctic
petrel and Antarctic fulmar, are of particular scientific
interest.
<P>

4. Sabrina Island, Balleny Islands
<P>
66&#176;54'S, 163&#176;20'E.  Approximate area 0&#183;4
km2.  Sabrina Island is 2 km south of Buckle Island.  Designated
because the Balleny Islands, as the most northerly Antarctic land
in the Ross Sea region, support fauna and flora which reflect
many circumpolar distributions at this latitude; and that Sabrina
Island in particular provides a representative sample of such
fauna and flora.
<P>

5. Beaufort Island, Ross Sea
<P>
76&#176;58'S, 167&#176;00'E.  Approximate area 18&#183;4
km2.  Beaufort Island lies 37 km north of Ross Island.  Designated
because the island contains substantial and varied avifauna, that
it is one of the most important breeding grounds in the region,
and that it should be protected to preserve the natural ecological system
as a reference area.
<P>

[6. Cape Crozier: redesignated as SSSI 4]
<P>

7. Cape Hallett, Victoria Land
<P>
72&#176;18'S, 179&#176;19'E.  Approximate area 0&#183;2
km2.  The area comprising a roughly rectangular block south of
the northern coast of Cape Hallett between the road, which runs
along the eastern side of Willett Cove and the western margin
of the permanent ice cap and to the north of an E-W line from a projection
of the line of the road southward to a point 200 m south of 72&#176;18'S
to the margin of the permanent ice cap.  Designated because Cape
Hallett includes a small patch of particularly rich and diverse
vegetation which supports a variety of terrestrial fauna and that
the ecosystem includes a rich avifauna.
<P>

8. Dion Islands, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula
<P>
67&#176;52'S, 68&#176;43'W.  Approximate area 6 km2. 
A group of small, rocky, low-lying islands in Marguerite Bay,
about 13 km south of Adelaide Island.  The area comprises all
of the Dion Islands archipelago with the intervening sea.  Designated
because amongst the Dion Islands is found the only colony of Emperor
penguins known to exist on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula,
and that the isolation of this colony from others of the same
species makes it of outstanding scientific interest.  It is also
the most northerly and probably the smallest Emperor penguin colony,
and one of only two in which breeding occurs on land (see also
SPA 1).  Adelie penguins and blue-eyed cormorants also breed here.
<P>

9. Green Island, Berthelot Islands, Antarctic Peninsula
<P>
65&#176;19'S, 64&#176;10'W.  Approximate area 0&#183;1
km2.  A small island situated 150 m north of the largest of the
Berthelot Islands. Designated because the vegetation on Green
Island is exceptionally rich, with well-developed continuous banks
of moss turf which overlie peat more than 1 m deep, supporting Antarctic hair
grass.  A large blue-eyed cormorant colony, Brown skuas, South polar skuas 
and hybrids are also found.
<P>

[10. Byers Peninsula: redesignated as SSSI 6]
<P>

[11. Cape Shirreff: redesignated as SSSI 32, also Ecosystem Monitoring
Site 2]
<P>

[12. Fildes Peninsula: redesignated as SSSI 5]
<P>

13. Moe Island, South Orkney Islands
<P>
60&#176;45'S, 45&#176;41'W.  Approximate area 1&#183;3
km2.  A small island lying about 300 m south-west of Signy Island.
 The off lying rocks are not included in the area.  Designated
because Moe Island provides a representative sample of the maritime
Antarctic ecosystem, including large areas of peat, chinstrap
penguins, cape petrels, Antarctic prions, Weddell seals,
leopard seals, and fur seals.  Intensive experimental research
on the neighbouring Signy Island may alter its ecosystem and
Moe Island should be protected as a control area for future comparison.
<P>

14. Lynch Island, South Orkney Islands
<P>
60&#176;40'S, 45&#176;38'W.  Approximate area 0&#183;1
km2.  A small island in Marshall Bay, off the south coast of Coronation
Island. Designated because the island supports one of the most
extensive and dense stands of Antarctic hair grass known in the
Treaty area and that it provides an outstanding example of a rare
natural ecological system.  Several species of moss are unusually
fertile, and the soil contains a rich invertebrate fauna.  Most
species of Antarctic seals are common around the island.
<P>

15. Southern Powell Island and adjacent islands, South Orkney
Islands
<P>
60&#176;45'S, 45&#176;02'W.  Approximate area 18 km2.
 The area includes all of Powell Island south of the latitude
of the southern summit of John Peaks, with the whole of Fredriksen
Island, Michelsen Island, Christoffersen Island, Grey Island and
adjacent unnamed islands.  Designated because southern Powell
Island and the adjacent islands support substantial
vegetation and a considerable bird and mammal fauna, which is
representative of the natural ecology of the South Orkney
Islands, and which is rendered more important by the presence
of an expanding breeding colony of fur seals.
<P>

16. Coppermine Peninsula, Robert Island
<P>
62&#176;23'S, 59&#176;42'W.  Approximate area 0&#183;9
km2.  The area comprises all the land west of a line drawn from
north to south across the peninsula 100 m west of the two shelters
found on the isthmus.  Designated because Coppermine Peninsula
is a biologically diverse area, supporting rich vegetation, with
a variety of terrestrial fauna, and that the ecosystem includes
a rich avifauna.  It has one of the largest continuous moss stands
in the Antarctic.  There are chinstrap penguins, Southern
giant petrels, Wilson's storm petrels, Antarctic terns, Dominican
gulls, elephant seals, Weddell seals and fur seals.
<P>

17. Litchfield Island, Arthur Harbour, Palmer Archipelago
<P>
66&#176;16'S, 64&#176;06'W.  Approximate area 2&#183;7
km2.  A small island designated because, with its littoral, it
possesses an unusually rich collection of marine and terrestrial
life, is unique amongst the neighbouring islands as a breeding
place for six species of native birds and provides an outstanding example
of the natural ecological system of the Antarctic Peninsula area.
<P>

18. North Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands
<P>
Between Conception Point, 60&#176;31'S, 45&#176;41'W;
Wave Peak, 60&#176;37'S, 45&#176;36'W; and Foul Point,
60&#176;32'S, 45&#176;29'W. Approximate area 88&#183;5 km2.
  The area lies on the central
north side of Coronation Island.  The entire area between the
two points is included.  The eastern boundary follows a precipitous
ridge 6 km southwards to a position at 750 m altitude
immediately to the west of Mt Nivea summit at 60&#176;35'S,
45&#176;29'W, thence WSW for 5&#183;5 km to a position
at 700 m altitude north-east of Wave Peak summit, then 2 km due
west to a point north-west of Wave Peak summit.  It continues
north-west for 5 km to the summit of an unnamed peak at the north-west end
of Brisbane Heights, and from here 6&#183;5 km north to Conception
Point.  The summits of Mt Nivea and Wave Peak and the col known
as High Stile are outside the area.  Ommanney Bay and the unnamed
bay to the west are included within the area south of the boundary
between Conception and Foul points (11&#183;5 km).  Designated 
because it embraces
areas of coastal ice-free terrain with large seabird colonies
and lichen-dominated cliffs, and permanent ice rising to the Brisbane
Heights plateau which provides an excellent representative
area of a pristine ice environment near the northern limit of
the maritime Antarctic, and that the interrelated terrestrial,
ice and marine components of the area comprise an integrated example
of the coastal, permanent ice, and sublittoral ecosystems typical of 
the maritime Antarctic environment.
<P>

19. Lagotellerie Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula
<P>
67&#176;53'S, 67&#176;24'W.  Approximate area 1&#183;2
km2.  The island lies about 3 km west of the southern part of
Horseshoe Island. Designated because the island contains a relatively
diverse flora and fauna typical of the southern Antarctic Peninsula;
that of particular interest is the abundance of the only two Antarctic
flowering plants which form stands up to 10 m2; that these are
amongst the largest stands known south of the South Shetland Islands,
being only 90 km north of their southern limit; that here both
Antarctic hair grass and Antarctic pearlwort flower profusely
and the seeds have a greater viability than those in the South
Orkney and South Shetland islands; that numerous mosses and lichens
also form well-developed communities
on the island; that a few of the mosses are fertile, a rare phenomenon
in most Antarctic localities; that the invertebrate fauna is rich
and that the island is one of the southernmost sites for the apterous
midge; that the shallow loamy soil developed beneath these swards
and its associated invertebrate fauna and microbiota are probably
unique at this latitude; that there is a colony of about 1000
Adelie penguins and one of the farthest south colonies of blue
eyed cormorants and that numerous pairs of Brown and South polar
skuas breed on the island.
<P>

20. New College Valley, Caughley Beach, Cape Bird, Ross Island
<P>
77&#176;14'S, 166&#176;23'E.  Approximate area 0&#183;1
km2.  The area consists of the ice-free terrain lying between
the cliff top above Caughley Beach and about 100 m east of the
Mt Bird ice cap, and between a line south of the main stream bed
of Keble Valley and the south ridge of New College Valley.  It is surrounded
on three sides by SSSI 10.  Designated because the
area contains some of the most luxuriant stands of vegetation
(algae, mosses, and lichens) and associated microflora and microfauna
in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica; that because of the susceptibility
of the cryptogamic vegetation to damage from trampling, the designation
of the area provides protection for its biota; and that the area
should serve as a conservation reserve representative of the adjacent
SSSI.
<P>

21. Avian Island, Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula
<P>
67&#176;46'S, 68&#176;54'W.  Approximate area 0&#183;8
km2.  The island lies 0&#183;25 km south of the south-west
tip of Adelaide Island.  The area consists of the island with
its littoral zone.  Designated because it is unique in the Antarctic
Peninsula region for its abundance and diversity of breeding seabirds, 
the most important
of which are Adelie penguins, blue-eyed cormorants,
Southern giant petrels, Dominican gulls, skuas, and Wilson's storm
petrels.  Weddell seals breed and fur seals come
ashore.
<P>

22. Cryptogam Ridge, Mount Melbourne, Victoria Land
<P>
74&#176;21'S, 164&#176;42'E.  Approximate area 0&#183;7
km2.  The area includes most of Cryptogam Ridge on the southern,
rim of the
main summit crater and lies within SSSI 24.  Designated because
the geothermal ground supports a unique community of
bryophytes, algae, and microbiota, including the only known occurrence
in the Antarctic of the moss Campylopus
pyriformis and the very rare continental occurrence of the liverwort
Cephaloziella exiliflora.  The site is comparable with
the only other known high-altitude geothermally-influenced ice-free
area near the summit of Mount Erebus.
<P>

23. Forlidas Pond and Davis Valley ponds, Dufek Massif
<P>
82&#176;27'15&quot;S, 51&#176;21'W.  Approximate area
9&#183;8 km2.  Forlidas Pond is near the east end of Dufek
Massif in a small unnamed dry valley about 1 km east of the northern
edge of Forlidas Ridge and about 1 km north-west of Davis Valley.
 The area
is in two parts.  A: within 500 m of the centre of Forlidas Pond,
and B: within 500 m radius of several meltwater ponds at the ice
margin along the northern edge of Davis Valley.  Designated because
the area contains some of the most southerly freshwater ponds
known in Antarctica that contain plant life which would be threatened
by possible contamination by human activity.  SPA 23 lies within
SRA 1.
<P>

24. Archipel de Point Geologie, Terre Adelie
<P>
140&#176; to 140&#176;02'E, 66&#176;39'30&quot; to
66&#176;40'30&quot;S.  Approximately 2 km2.  Includes Ile
Jean Rostand, Ile Alexis Carrel, Ile Lamarck, Iles Claude Bernard,
Nunatak du Bon Docteur, and breeding Emperor penguin colony. 
Designated because it is
a representative area of considerable biological, geological,
and aesthetic value; contains a high diversity of animals and
plants and
is an important area for research; and that long-term research
programmes on bird colonies and geology have been conducted in
the area since 1952.

<H3><A NAME="bb">Sites of Special Scientific Interest</A></H3>

The  purpose  of  SSSIs is to protect any kind of scientific investigation
or to set aside undisturbed reference  areas  for  the needs 
of a particular science.  SSSIs can only be designated where there
is a demonstrable risk of harmful interference.   A specific 
time  limit  is  agreed, but the time limit can be reviewed and,
if necessary, extended.  Each  SSSI  should  have  a management
 plan that, among other things, identifies other types of research
that would not interfere with the purposes  for which the SSSI
was designated.
<P>

1. Cape Royds, Ross Island
<P>
77&#176;33'S, 166&#176;08'E.  Approximate area 4&#183;6
km2.  The area west of a line drawn from the south coast of Cape
Royds through Flagstaff Hill to the south-eastern tip of Pony
Lake, and the west shore of this lake; and south of a line drawn
from the western extremity of Pony Lake 280&#176; true to
the coast; including the littoral and sublittoral zones from Derrick
Point on the east side of Arrival Bay about 4 km northwards to
Rocky Point to the north of Horseshoe Bay, extending 500 m
offshore from high water mark.  Designated because the area supports
the most southerly Adelie penguin colony known,
the survival of which is marginal.  The population declined rapidly
from 1956 following interference by visitors until 1963
when United States and New Zealand authorities agreed to restrict
activities.  Expiry of designation extended to 31
December 2000.

77&#176;31'S, 169&#176;20'E; and also includes the land
area lying north of a line from 77&#176;28'S, 169&#176;20'E
to the summit of Post Office Hill and north-east of a
line bearing 315&#176; true from the Summit of Post Office
Hill to the coast.  Approximate area 19 km2.  Designated because
the emperor and Adelie penguin colonies are the subject of long-term
studies of population dynamics and social behaviour, and are relatively
accessible by air from McMurdo Station and Scott Base.  Expiry
of designation 31 December 2001.
<P>

5. Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, South Shetland
Islands
<P>
There are two sites: Site A; between 62&#176;10'50&quot;S
and 62&#176;11'28&quot;S, and between 58&#176;55'27&quot;W
and 58&#176;56'38&quot;W; and Site B; between 62&#176;12'30&quot;S
and 62&#176;12'59&quot;S, and between 58&#176;57'11&quot;W

Designated because unique fossil ichnolites found in these areas
are located close to several permanent scientific stations which
are frequently, and increasingly, visited by tourist groups. 
The areas also contain representative sequences of
Tertiary strata.  Expiry of designation 31 December 2001.
<P>

6. Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands
<P>
62&#176;38'S, 61&#176;05'W, centred on this point Byers
Peninsula is an extensive, largely ice-free area at the western
end of Livingston Island.  Approximate area 65&#183;7 km2.
 The site comprises the entire area of Byers Peninsula extending
from the
ice margin on the west side of Rotch Dome to a point directly
north of Stackpole Rocks westwards to the west end of Ray Promontory.
The littoral zone of the peninsula is included within the site.
 Designated because the fossils found in this area provide evidence
of the former link between Antarctica and the other southern continents.
 It is important to protect these (Jurassic and Cretaceous) rocks
from being used as building materials or as souvenirs.  Lakes
contain aquatic mosses and
serve as breeding sites for the midge Parochlus steineni, the
only native winged insect in the Antarctic.  The peninsula is
of exceptional historical interest, containing the greatest concentration
of 19<SUP>th</SUP> century archaeological sites in Antarctica.
 Expiry of designation 31 December 2001.
<P>

7. Haswell Island
<P>
66&#176;31'S, 93&#176;00'E.  Approximate area 1 km2. 
The site consists of Haswell Island, the largest of a group of
islands lying off Mirnyy Station, with its littoral zone and the
surrounding fast ice (when present).  Designated because the site
is an exceptionally prolific and representative breeding locality
for all the species of birds which occur in this part of the Antarctic:
five species of petrel, one species of skua, and one species of
penguin.  The site provides exceptional
opportunities for research and needs protection in view of its
close proximity to a large research station.  Expiry of
designation 31 December 2001.
<P>

8. Western shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island
<P>
62&#176;08'S, 53&#176;29'W.  Approximate area 17&#183;5
km2.  An area on the western shore of Admiralty Bay, south of
Ezcurra Inlet, south of a line connecting Jardine Peak and the
shore immediately to the north of a prominent group of rocks characterized
by a covering of orange lichens bearing approximately 068&#176;
from Jardine Peak, and east of a line joining Jardine Peak, The

The  purpose  of  MPAs is to assist in coordinating human activities
in areas where such activities pose  identified  risks  of mutual
  interference   or   cumulative  environmental  effects.   Each
 MPA  develops  a   management   plan   to   identify environmental
characteristics threatened by current or planned activities, and
agrees specific measures to avoid or minimize harmful and cumulative
effects.  These areas may be suspended by Annex V of the Environmental
Protocol.
