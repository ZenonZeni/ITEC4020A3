<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Why Should I Invest in Mutual
Funds?</STRONG></FONT><P>



Many people who use savings for emergency funds and other short-term needs also use
investments
to pursue longer-term goals. If you're planning to buy a home, send your children
to college,
or enjoy a
comfortable retirement, you may have one or more of the following investment
objectives.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>I'd like to pursue higher income.</EM>  Many investments seek higher income
than is
typically available through bank deposits or CDs.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP> You may choose to receive any income in cash or
reinvest it for
the power of compounding over time.
<P>
<EM>I'd like to pursue growth opportunities.</EM>  Some investments seek to
increase the
value of your money through capital appreciation. If the price of your investment
goes up,
you may be able to sell it at a profit. 
<P>
<EM>I'd like to pursue both growth and income.</EM>  Several investments combine
the
potential for growth with opportunities for income, seeking to offer investors the
benefits
of both. 
<P>
<EM>I'd like to keep more of what I earn.</EM>
Some investments seek income that's substantially free from Federal income taxes.
Others
may
offer tax advantages at the Federal and state or, Federal, state, and local levels.
Tax-free
investing is an easy way to keep more of what you earn. 
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, with all mutual funds,
investment values will
fluctuate, so when
you sell shares, they may be worth more or less than their original cost.  Mutual funds are among the most popular ways to invest - and for good reason. When
you
invest
in a mutual fund, you join other investors, pooling your money to purchase
securities and
pursue a specific objective. 
<P>
If you don't have the time to follow the markets, the experience to manage a
portfolio, or
the resources to diversify on your own, mutual funds may offer you three important
advantages.
<P>
<STRONG>Professional management  </STRONG><BR>
Mutual funds are managed by experienced investment professionals, who continually
monitor the
economy, the markets, and individual securities to free you from having to make
complex
day-to-day
investment decisions.
<P>
<STRONG>Diversification</STRONG><BR>
By pooling the resources of many investors, mutual funds are able to purchase a
broader
range
of
securities than most individuals could afford on their own. While the types of
securities a
fund may
purchase will depend on its investment objective, diversification is widely
recognized as a
way to help
reduce investment risk. 
<P>
<STRONG>Convenience </STRONG><BR>
Mutual funds are a convenient and affordable way to invest. In many cases, the
minimum
investment
may be less than the cost of a single security in the fund's portfolio. Depending
on your
needs, you can
arrange to have any income or capital gains automatically reinvested or sent
directly to you. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="1"><B>1</B></A></FONT></SUP> Savings
accounts
and CDs may be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and CDs provide
interest
at
guaranteed fixed rates. Investments in The MainStay Funds are not bank deposits,
are not
guaranteed,
and share prices and investment returns will vary with market conditions. When
shares are
redeemed,
they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
