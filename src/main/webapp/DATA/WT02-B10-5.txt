        is canine Cushing's disease?</td>
        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-Cushing's
        disease is a disorder of the pituitary gland and
        hypothalamic regulatory center of the brain. This disease
        is commonly encountered in middle aged and older pet
        dogs, and results in excessive blood cortisol. Excessive
        cortisol is associated with most of the clinical signs
        typical of the disease. </td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-What
        are the clinical signs? </td>
        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-The
        onset of Cushing's in most dogs is quite slow and the
        clinical signs are often thought by owners to be simple
        aging. Some of the more common clinical signs are
        increased water consumption and increased urination,
        changes in appetite, muscle weakness, lethargy, &quot;pot
        bellied&quot; appearance, hair loss, decreased activity,
        excessive panting and changes in the sleep patterns of
        your pet. </td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-How
        is Cushing's disease diagnosed? </td>
        <td width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-Cushing's
        disease is diagnosed by your veterinarian based on your
        dog's clinical signs, and results of laboratory tests,
        including special hormone tests.<br>
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-When
        Cushing's disease is diagnosed, what are our options? </td>
        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-There
        is no cure for Cushing's disease, and until the recent
        approval of Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup>
        there were no approved drugs to help dogs with this
        disorder. Without treatment, the disease will be
        progressive and ultimately may be fatal. </td>

        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-How
        does Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup> work? </td>
        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-Anipryl<sup><font
        size="1">&#174;</font></sup> helps restore the natural
        balance of important brain chemicals, especially
        dopamine, which in turn helps alleviate the clinical
        signs of Cushing's disease. Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup>
        also helps decrease toxic compounds (free radicals) in
        the brain. </td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-Is
        Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup> safe? </td>
        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-Anipryl<sup><font
        size="1">&#174;</font></sup> has been shown to be safe
        when used as directed. In clinical trials, no adverse
        interactions were found when Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup>
        was used with other common veterinary drugs.</td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-How
        effective is Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup>? </td>
        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-In
        several clinical trials conducted at veterinary colleges
        and private veterinary clinics throughout North America,
        more than 70% of treated pet dogs responded favorably,
        demonstrated by amelioration of clinical signs and
        improvement in cortisol regulation. </td>

        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-How
        soon can I expect to see the results of Anipryl<sup><font
        size="1">&#174;</font></sup> treatment? </td>
        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-Many
        dogs treated with Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup>
        show positive response within 2 to 4 weeks. Some dogs
        require more time to respond. </td>

        <td valign="top" width="22%"><em><strong>Q</strong></em>-
        How long must my dog continue on Anipryl<sup><font

        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-
        There is no cure for Cushing's disease. However, clinical
        trials demonstrated the positive results of long term
        Anipryl<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup> therapy.
        Your pet will likely require treatment with Anipryl<sup><font
        size="1">&#174;</font></sup> daily, and your dog should
        be evaluated regularly by your veterinarian. </td>

        <td valign="top" width="34%"><em><strong>A</strong></em>-Anipryl<sup><font
        size="1">&#174;</font></sup> is available from your
        veterinarian as easy to administer tablets. Most dogs
        receive one tablet each day, usually in the morning. Your
        veterinarian will provide individualized instructions for
        your pet.</td>
