7 disqualified from contesting top posts / Umno

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

Umno cracks down on abuses 

SEVEN candidates, six of them vying for Umno Supreme Council posts, were
disqualified from contesting the elections starting tomorrow for abuse of
power and flouting party rules.

And more are likely to be disqualified, with investigations currently under
way against some candidates for serious breaches of discipline.

At a press conference yesterday evening, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said a case
under investigation involved a contestant for the post of Umno Youth chief who
had asked delegates to swear by the Quran to support him.

Said Datuk Seri Anwar: "We have not got concrete evidence as yet but using the
Quran for this purpose to me is a serious offence."

He identified the six who were disqualified from contesting the Supreme
Council election as Datuk Aini Taib, Selangor state executive councillor;
Datuk Shariff Omar, deputy chief minister of Penang; Datuk Malik Hanapiah,
Perak state executive councillor and former political secretary of Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad; Datuk Salomon Selamat, Member of
Parliament and former political secretary of Datuk Anwar; Mr Latiff Mirasa,
Penang state executive councillor and Datuk Adam Hamid, Johor state executive
councillor.

All were among 61 people contesting for the 25 posts available on the Supreme
Council, the highest decision-making body in the party.

The seventh person disqualified from the elections was Mr Ayob Mat Aris, who
was vying for a position on the Umno Youth executive council.

Datuk Anwar said that the decision to disqualify these members were taken at a
special committee meeting chaired yesterday afternoon by Dr Mahathir. He said
that solid evidence had been obtained by the party, enabling it to take this
action.

The evidence related to money politics, abuse of power and violation of the
no-campaigning rule which was introduced by the party leadership to curb
excessive politicking.

He said that this action should put to rest fears that some people were
receiving favours, noting that Datuk Malik was the former political secretary
of the party chief while Datuk Salomon was his former political secretary.

The disqualification of the seven follows the disciplinary action taken by
Umno against five members of the Jempol division in Negeri Sembilan for being
involved in money politics.

Datuk Seri Anwar said that investigations into money politics and other
illegal practices would continue even after the elections.

Umno has been waging an ongoing battle against money politics which has been
rampant in the party in recent years.

On Sunday, party chief Dr Mahathir noted that money politics seemed to have
become a norm in Umno and the time had come to rid the party of all forms of
corruption and filth.

He said that if the party leadership did not take stern measures to remedy the
situation, it could endanger not only the party but the whole race and nation.

"We have repeatedly talked about money politics and convened a special
assembly in 1994 but the problem still could not be overcome. Instead, it
seems like it has become an institution."

SEVEN NAMED

* Datuk Aini Taib, Selangor state executive councillor * Datuk Shariff Omar,
deputy chief minister of Penang * Datuk Malik Hanapiah, Perak state executive
councillor and former political secretary of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad * Datuk Salomon Selamat, Member of Parliament and former
political secretary of Datuk Anwar * Mr Latiff Mirasa, Penang state executive
councillor * Datuk Adam Hamid, Johor state executive councillor. * Mr Ayob Mat
Aris

Sipadan, Ligitan row to go to World Court: Leaders to explore further
bridge proposal

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

MALAYSIA and Indonesia have decided to refer their claims on the Sipadan and
Ligitan Islands to the International Court of Justice.

This ends a stalemate over the islands, lying off the border between Sabah and
East Kalimantan. The two countries have been trying to resolve the issue since
1991.

The decision was made after a meeting between Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and President Suharto of Indonesian here yesterday.

During the 90-minute meeting, a wide range of issues, from economic
cooperation to the agenda for the World Trade Organisation meeting in
Singapore, were discussed.

Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesian Foreign minister, briefed the press on the
discussion. He said that after exhausting legal and technical arguments on the
islands issue, it was decided that the talks should be elevated to the
political stage.

Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and Indonesia's
State Secretary Moerdiono held four rounds of talks and both concluded that
they had strong cases. In view of this deadlock, Mr Alatas said both Dr
Mahathir and President Suharto concluded that the question of Sipadan and
Ligitan islands should be referred to the ICJ.

He told a packed press conference: "We are doing so because both sides are of
the view that the matter should not drag on too long" -as the issue might be
exploited by those not wishing Malaysia and Indonesia to have close relations.

The decision of the ICJ, he said, would be accepted by both countries. The
next step would involve Mr Alatas and his Malaysian counterpart Datuk Abdullah
Badawi working out the procedures to forward the case together.

He stressed that both countries would forward the case together. "We must move
in unison. We believe in doing so, we would resolve the issue amicably and in
a just way."

The Indonesian minister said that this case showed that whenever there was a
dispute between Asean countries, it could be settled peacefully and in the
spirit of Asean.

Indonesia's agreement to agree to refer the claim is a change from its
previous position. Last month, Armed Forces chief Feisal Tanjung was quoted by
Antara national news agency as saying that any move to refer the issue to the
international court would mean involving a third party.

He said that it was not good to let other countries which do not understand
the problem meddle in it. But Indonesia never shut the door on this method of
resolution.

Activists land on Diaoyu islands: Page 14

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lee San Chouy, Taiwan Correspondent

Protesters plant Taiwan and Chinese flags

TAIPEI -Taiwan and Hongkong protesters yesterday broke through a Japanese
maritime cordon to land on the disputed Daioyu islands, where they planted
Taiwanese and Chinese flags to challenge Tokyo's claim to the islands.

Taipei provincial assemblyman Ching Jie-shou and Hongkong legislator Tsang Kin
Shing were among the seven protesters who swam ashore to plant three
blue-and-red Taiwanese flags and one red five-star Chinese flag early
yesterday morning, said a United Evening News report filed from one of the 50
boats, which set off on the third and largest protest voyage on Sunday.

The flags were swiftly removed by Japanese Maritime Safety Agency officials.

Having accomplished its mission, the flotilla returned to the northern
Taiwanese port of Shen Ao, where a heroes' welcome greeted the protesters.

In Hongkong, the people were equally jubilant on hearing news of the
successful landing.

In Tokyo, Japanese officials gave a veiled warning that future protest boats
could be seized if found in Japanese waters.

Mr Ching said in an interview with state radio: "We will continue our efforts
to protect the Diaoyu islands ... We will not quit until we succeed."

According to the United Evening News report, at least 50 Japanese boats and
helicopters were mobilised to stop the protest boats from entering the
12-nautical-mile territorial zone claimed by Japan.

No one was hurt yesterday, although some people had to scramble onto other
protest vessels after their boat was rammed by a Japanese patrol boat amid the
tense stand-off.

Unconfirmed reports said that at least one protester fell overboard and was
then rescued.

The more than 300 activists had set sail in 30 boats from Taiwan's Wanli and
Shen Ao ports on Sunday evening for the Diaoyu islands. Twenty boats carrying
journalists accompanied them.

At 5.35 am yesterday, they arrived within the 12-nautical-mile limit where
Japanese patrol boats began to surround the flotilla.

But the Japanese boats were unable to stop the small boats whose crews had
been practising landings for a week.

Mr Ching was later quoted as saying that some activists had set off on rubber
boats and water scooters to divert the attention of the Japanese boats while
the seven swam ashore.

At 6.20 am, three activists including Mr Ching and Mr Tsang planted a Chinese
flag and a Taiwanese flag near the lighthouse erected by a Japanese right-wing
group in July.

Ten minutes later, they were driven off the island by Japanese maritime
police, who tore the flags down.

Another group of four activists, however, managed to make a landing at 6.35
am. The four, who stayed for a few minutes on the island, planted two
Taiwanese flags.

One of them, Mr Lee Chueh-min, was later quoted as saying: "We were
surrounded. The sea was covered with Japanese ships and the sky was full of
helicopters, but I had only one goal in mind -to land and to place the
Taiwanese flag.

"This is probably the most important moment of my life."

Taipei yesterday praised the landing, but reiterated its position that the
Diaoyu dispute should be resolved only through diplomacy and negotiations.

Government spokesman Su Chi said: "We always admire and recognise acts of
patriotism to protect our land. We also feel very good that ... they are
returning after a rational, peaceful protest."

However, he added: "The sovereignty and territorial disputes should all be
resolved through negotiations."

Taiwan and Japan have conducted two rounds of "unofficial" talks over the
dispute, including the issue of fishing rights near the island group, but
failed to reach an agreement.

The Diaoyu chain, known in Japan as the Senkaku islands, lie about 150 km off
north-eastern Taiwan and are believed to be potentially rich in oil and
natural gas.

Anti-Japanese sentiment in China, Taiwan and Hongkong has been rising since
July.

Two protest voyages took place last month.

The leader of the second trip, Hongkong activist David Chan, drowned after
jumping into the sea near the islands.

Taipei forum to look into cross-strait relations

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Sunny Goh

It will chart path based on public consensus

TAIWAN will hold an inaugural national conference in late December to chart
its position on troubled ties with China "based on public consensus", a
spokesman for the President's Office told The Straits Times yesterday.

The grand forum, which will take in views ranging from opposition parties to
business guilds, will also "brainstorm" changes to the island's Constitution
and the speeding up of its economic development.

Findings and suggestions from the meeting will be compiled into a report to be
submitted to President Lee Teng-hui to help him "set the direction for the
island's future", the spokesman said.

"It is the first ever meeting of its kind, and participation is expected to be
massive in terms of representation and vigorous in debate," he said by
telephone.

The "National Development Conference" will bring together 150 representatives
-50 each for discussions on the constitutional system, economic development
and cross-strait relations -who will be invited from all sectors of society.
These three have been the most problematic issues affecting Taiwan in recent
years, with corruption and triad activities on the rise and Sino-Taiwan ties
at a low ebb.

President Lee appointed Vice-President Lien Chan as the convenor of a
preparatory committee last month to work out the conference details, and
invited each of the three major political parties to assign a deputy convenor.

Mr Tsiang Yien-si, Kuomintang Central Standing Committee member and senior
adviser to the President, is expected to be the KMT's deputy convenor. The
deputy convenors for the Democratic Progressive Party and the New Party have
not yet been made known.

Asked whether the Taipei authorities would abide by the conference
recommendations, the spokesman said that the government would have to take the
suggestions very seriously, otherwise it would defeat the purpose of such a
meeting.

President Lee himself is expected to evaluate the more sensitive proposals as
part of his election pledge in the presidential election in March this year to
seek public consensus on major policy and reform programmes.

But the two opposition parties had already poured cold water on the idea,
although neither had turned down an invitation to take part. "This is just
smoke. It is like giving a candy to cheat a child," said DPP legislative whip
Yen Chin-fu.

Opposition New Party lawmaker Yok Yu-ming, also pessimistic, said the meeting
would not solve any problems.

While the conference is set for end-December, the actual dates and venue have
not been fixed. But the official Free China Journal said the meeting would
last five days, probably from Dec 23, with the Taipei International Convention
Centre and the Chungshan Building on Yangming Mountain as the two most likely
venues.

2 Taiwan officials nabbed for crime

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

TWO Taiwan councillors were detained by police in the continuing crackdown
against organised crime, the China Times reported yesterday.

Chiayi city councillor Wu Jung-an and Changhua county councillor Hsieh
Hung-lung, whose cases are not linked, are being remanded in the eastern
Taiwan prison on Green Island.

Wu, first arrested for alleged drug trafficking in August, was caught
attacking a debtor on Sept 24 together with more than 10 gangsters who were
carrying illegal arms, the Chinese-language daily said.

During investigations, unidentified witnesses told police of Wu's involvement
in several blackmail cases. Two people accused him of threatening them with a
gun and coercing them to buy second-hand cars from him at exorbitant prices.

A third person said Wu had forced him to hand over NT$200,000 (S$10,360) to
buy drugs.

As for Hsieh, he was arrested last Friday for firing a shot at a man earlier
this year.

According to China Times, he admitted shooting the man, who helped him run a
lounge, because of a financial dispute.

Communist Party to endorse Jiang"s authority at plenum

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is expected to endorse President Jiang
Zemin's "leadership and authority" at the party's plenum this week, it was
reported yesterday.

Quoting a well-informed source in Beijing, the independent Chinese-language
Ming Pao Daily News said the CCP would give its endorsement at the end of the
annual meeting.

Elaborating on his achievements, the report said that since Mr Jiang, 70,
became party general secretary in 1989, he had been placing equal emphasis on
"material civilisation" and "spiritual civilisation".

Spiritual civilisation -the promotion of communal morality in a society which
has attained economic progress -has been promoted strongly in China's official
media in recent months.

Mr Jiang has also stressed the need to "talk politics" and to place emphasis
on the "righteous spirit" and on learning.

A resolution on spiritual civilisation to be passed at the plenum would make
these theories the official line and the overall will of the party, added the
report.

In his speech to the plenum, which starts today, Mr Jiang is expected to call
for "the enhancement of the power of the party" in leading China into the 21st
century.

His vision for the party's Politburo and Central Committee is for them to "use
political superiority to control the overall situation and central authority
to coordinate the national pace and unify the party's will".

The Ming Pao report also quoted analysts as saying that Mr Jiang's call to
safeguard the party's political authority had been well received within its
ranks and in the military.

They said that the Beijing leader's determination to make political authority
the overall guiding principle showed China would continue to use "a gradually
progressive and moderate approach" towards an in-depth development of the
country's reforms.

Beijing : It"s Chinese territory: Activists land on Diaoyu islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Mary Kwang, China Correspondent

BEIJING -A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday reiterated that the
Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea were an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.

He also said that the Chinese stance on the issue was consistent and clear.

He made these remarks in response to queries from the media on China's
reaction to the early-morning landing yesterday by Hongkong and Taiwanese
protesters on the disputed islands.

The spokesman also said that incidents initiated by the Japanese side had
provoked and angered the Chinese people.

While he did not say what these incidents were, his remarks were apparently
targeted at the construction of a lighthouse on one of the islands in July by
Japanese right-wingers.

The Japanese Coastguard had even allowed the right-wingers to return to the
islands to repair the structure after it was damaged in a typhoon, but they
had turned away boats from Hongkong and Taiwan approaching the islands.

Hongkongers jubilant at news of protest landing: Activists land on Diaoyu
islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Wang Hui Ling, Hongkong Correspondent

Event grabs morning and evening headlines

HONGKONGERS greeted with jubilation the landing on the disputed Diaoyu islands
by protesters from Hongkong and Taiwan early yesterday.

News of the successful mission hit the headlines in the morning and was played
up in graphic detail by evening newspapers here.

At least one Cantonese news station devoted a few hours to the news, airing
interviews with analysts and reporters covering the event.

Some radio listeners who called a phone-in programme also referred to the
event, even though the programme dealt with a completely different topic.

A television station devoted 27 minutes of its half-hour evening news bulletin
in Cantonese to coverage of the voyage, with extensive footage of the landing,
the planting of the Chinese flag, the encounters with the Japanese authorities
as well as the return of the protesters to Taiwan's Shen Ao port.

Politicians from two of Hongkong's biggest political parties -the Democratic
Party and the Liberal Party -also welcomed the news, although they were quick
to add that now that the protesters had fulfilled their mission to plant flags
on the disputed islands, the ball was now in Beijing's court to pursue the
matter.

Democratic Party vice-chairman Yeung Sam said: "All we are trying to do is
make a symbolic protest against Japanese occupation of the islands.

"Actually, there is not much the people in the community can do because it is
all related to the foreign policy of the Chinese government.

"If the Chinese government refuses to take tough action against the Japanese
government, it will be very difficult for China to reclaim its sovereignty
over the islands."

Liberal Party vice-chairman Ronald Arculli said that he hoped the move would
give the Chinese government an understanding of the strength of feelings over
the issue and inspire it to open diplomatic channels to settle the dispute.

The New Evening Post and the Sing Tao Evening News splashed the landing on
their front pages.

Calling it a successful breach of Japanese defences, they also accused the
Japanese of crashing into some protesters' boats. One headline screamed:
"Shameless Japanese security forces remove Chinese flags but claim they were
blown away" in an apparent reference to eyewitnesses' claims that Japanese
coast guards had removed the Chinese flags placed by the protesters.

Analysts interviewed on radio said that the successful voyage was a testimony
to the better preparations and strategies adopted by the latest group of
protesters.

Democratic Party legislator Tsang Kin Shing, who was one of those who reached
one of the disputed islands, told reporters that he would not be organising
another trip to the islands to dismantle a lighthouse erected by Japanese
right-wingers. He was reported to have said that such a task should be left to
the Chinese government.

Amid the jubilation, an English-language radio station yesterday ran an
interview with a Caucasian photographer who had accompanied an earlier
ill-fated voyage to the Diaoyu islands, in which protester David Chan drowned.

He said that the attempt to make Chan out as a hero and martyr was
regrettable, as his action was foolish and had endangered lives. It was also
partly the result of frenzy whipped up by the media, he added.

Landing by HK, Taiwan activists regrettable : Japan: Activists land on
Diaoyu islands

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kwan Weng Kin, Japan Correspondent

Trespassing vessels could be seized, it warns

TOKYO -Japanese officials yesterday expressed regret at the early-morning
landing by Hongkong and Taiwan activists on the disputed Diaoyu islands and
hinted that vessels carrying protesters could be seized in future if they were
found trespassing in Japan's territorial seas.

Commenting on the landing, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto stressed the need
for the authorities on all sides to take a level-headed approach.

"Whether this affair will blow up any further will depend on whether the
authorities on both sides will be able to create calm," he told reporters.

Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Teijiro Furukawa, standing in as the
government's chief spokesman, described as "extremely regrettable" the landing
on the Diaoyu group -known as Senkaku islands to the Japanese -and echoed the
Premier's call for calm.

"Relations with neighbouring countries and territories must not deteriorate
because of such incidents. We hope all parties concerned will deal with it
calmly," he said.

Although vessels carrying activists from Hongkong and Taiwan succeeded in
eluding patrol boats belonging to the Maritime Safety Agency -Japan's coast
guard -and got close to the islands yesterday, the agency made no attempt to
seize the trespassers.

"But in future, if they do not comply with our warning to withdraw, we will
take appropriate measures," said Mr Furukawa, raising the possibility that the
agency would in future apprehend the protest boats.

In October 1990, the Japanese authorities succeeded in repelling a fishing
boat carrying Taiwanese athletes that attempted to plant an Olympic torch on
the Diaoyu islands.

Yesterday afternoon, Foreign Ministry Vice-Minister Sadayuki Hayashi announced
that Japan would ask the authorities in Beijing, Hongkong and Taipei formally
to prevent a repeat of yesterday's incident.

"The problem must not affect our relations with neighbouring countries. I
believe China and Taiwan feel the same way," he said.

Japanese officials also expressed the hope that the matter would subside now
that the activists had achieved their objective of reaching the islands and
demonstrating the respective claims of the Chinese and Taiwanese.

On Sept 26, Hongkong protest leader David Chan drowned in a mishap off the
disputed islands after a vessel carrying him and other activists were
prevented from landing by Japanese patrol boats.

Yesterday's landing was displayed prominently on the front pages of the
evening editions of the major Japanese papers although the media here has by
and large given minimal coverage to the territorial dispute with China and
Taiwan.

For example, there have been no stories in the press to explain the historical
basis for Japan's claim to the islands, reflecting in part the fact that most
Japanese have shown little interest in the dispute.

But despite the relatively low-key treatment accorded the issue here, Mr
Hashimoto expressed unhappiness with the Japanese media recently, saying it
was against Japan's national interests for the press to highlight the issue.

Proposed sales-tax hike Japan"s main issue for coming polls

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kwan Weng Kin, Japan Correspondent

TOKYO -The government's proposed hike in the sales tax from next April emerged
clearly yesterday as the main issue dividing Japan's two largest political
parties in the upcoming general election, campaigning for which begins
officially today.

The tax-policy gap between the Liberal Democratic Party led by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and the opposition New Frontier Party headed by Mr Ichiro
Ozawa was highlighted in a nationally-televised debate for leaders of Japan's
six largest parties.

Seeking to continue as Premier after the polls, Mr Hashimoto reiterated his
determination to raise the sales tax from the existing three per cent to five
per cent next year to pay for the burgeoning costs of welfare and other public
services.

But he stressed that the hike would be linked to the implementation of
administrative and economic reforms and that pensioners and other low-income
earners likely to be penalised by the higher tax would receive special
consideration.

Criticising Mr Hashimoto's coalition government for failing to push hard
enough for reforms so far, Mr Ozawa opposed an increase in the sales tax and
pledged to reduce taxes by 18 trillion yen (S$228 billion) and to make up for
the loss in revenue by slashing government expenditure and expanding consumer
spending.

The Japan Communist Party was the only other party among the six yesterday
which included the Democratic Party of Japan, the Social Democratic Party and
the Sakigake -that supported a freeze in the sales tax. Apart from this
glaring difference over tax policy between the LDP and NFP, all six parties
were unanimous in their calls for comprehensive reforms to the country's
administrative and economic systems.

LDP's Mr Hashimoto appealed to voters to give his party a mandate to bring
about a "robust economy" through deregulation and reforms and reminded
everyone that he had plans to set up a panel of advisers to work out an action
programme within a year.

Mr Ozawa, saying he would retire from politics if his party should come to
power and fail to carry out its election promises, warned voters they had a
choice between "prosperity through drastic reforms" or "decay by taking no
action".

Yesterday's party leaders' debate laid down the battle lines for the election
campaigning which kicks off today.

But politicians will undoubtedly have difficulty getting their messages across
to their electorate as a survey by the quasi-national NHK network released
yesterday found that only 50 per cent of Japanese voters were interested in
the upcoming polls.

This was 17 percentage points lower than in the July 1993 elections, which
ushered in Japan's first coalition government in decades.

Nevertheless, a record number of over 1,400 candidates are expected to vie for
500 Lower House seats in the Oct 20 election which will be conducted under a
new system of single-seat wards and proportional representation.

Many candidates belonging to the major parties are exploiting a provision in
the election law that allows candidates to stand in both single-seat wards and
proportional representation constituencies, thus increasing their chances of
winning a parliamentary seat.

Indonesia urged to ban distribution and sale of alcohol

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Paul Jacob, Indonesia Correspondent

Religious objections, dangers of drink cited

JAKARTA -Muslim grassroots leaders and youth representatives have called on
the local government here and provincial administrations elsewhere to move
towards imposing a comprehensive ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol
in the country.

About 3,000 representatives, citing religious objections and the dangers that
alcohol and its easy availability posed to Indonesian youths in particular,
made the call in a statement issued after gathering for a sermon on Sunday at
the Matraman Mosque in East Jakarta.

The representatives recognised efforts to tighten the supervision, control and
sale of alcohol through local government regulations but said that the
authorities should go a step further and impose an outright ban.

Their statement said that distributors and consumers were already faced with
the full weight "of sanctions from Allah".

As such, government moves to impose stringent controls and greater supervision
on alcohol -such as by increasing the cost of distribution licence fees and
higher penalties for violating rules -had to be revised.

The authorities should instead "prevent and prohibit every effort to legalise
alcoholic beverages" and should develop policies and action programmes which
would "increase faith and piety" and ensure there could be abstinence from
"that which is known to be forbidden".

The Republika daily yesterday quoted leaders like Haji Nurudin, secretary of
the Madura Ulemas Board, as saying yesterday that "alcohol, or wine and
liquor, according to the Prophet Muhammed, is the source of all evil".

The call on Sunday followed moves by local governments in Jakarta, West
Sumatra and East Java to institute new rules which they believed would help
keep alcohol distribution and consumption under control while not eliminating
it altogether.

Higher annual licence fees -up to 10 million rupiah (S$6,000) from the current
one million rupiah -have been proposed for approval by the Home Affairs
Ministry. These would ultimately increase the cost of alcohol sold at outlets
and thereby prevent youths from being able to afford to drink.

Labels must also be affixed on bottles warning that liquor is harmful and the
minimum content of bottles must be 200 cc -again to ensure that the higher
cost would make alcoholic beverages unaffordable to youths.

The grassroots leaders and youth representatives who met on Sunday were not
alone in their quest to ban the sale and distribution of alcohol.

Representatives of the Muslim-based United Development Party have said
previously that steps being proposed by the local government meant that liquor
could still be sold.

The West Sumatra chapter of the Majelis Ulama Indonesia, the country's highest
council on Islamic affairs, made a similar call for controlling regulations to
be revised so that alcohol would be banned, while Muslim leaders in East Java
also urged a review, citing alcohol's incompatibility with religious
teachings.

There has yet to be any formal central-government reaction although leaders
such as Information Minister Harmoko, who also chairs the ruling Golkar party,
said previously that the party wanted firmer measures in place, including the
imposition of strict maximum limits on the alcohol content of beverages sold
to the public.

Another underlying argument used by opponents of alcohol has been the link
which many see between alcohol consumption and criminal activity, and
alcohol's effects on youths.

Beer brewers here produce a total of 150 million litres annually with total
sales amounting to 500 billion rupiah.

According to the Republika daily, annual domestic production of alcoholic
beverages totals eight million cartons while imports amount to five million
cartons annually.

Two main blocs emerging as Thai parties get set for polls

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Sinfah Tunsarawuth in Bangkok

THAI political parties have virtually re-aligned themselves into two blocs in
the run-up to next month's general election with the Democrat and New
Aspiration parties forming the core of each camp.

The Democrats received a boost over the weekend when prominent banker and
former finance minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda -believed to be groomed by
party leader Chuan Leekpai to succeed him -announced he would contest the
polls on a Democrat ticket.

Mr Tarrin's decision to make his electoral debut in Bangkok is likely to
enhance the prospects of the Democrats winning most of the 37 seats in the
capital.

The Democrats last week forged an understanding with four parties -Chart
Pattana, Palang Dharma, Seritham and Solidarity -to form the next coalition
government if the party won the most seats in the House of Representatives on
Nov 17.

The five parties also agreed to be "friendly" and to avoid attacking each
other during the election campaign.

But their agreement did not preclude any party from joining the other bloc
-led by the New Aspiration Party (NAP) of General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh -if it
should win the election and form the core of the next government.

The NAP has not yet received any open support from other parties, but it is
likely that three parties -Social Action, Prachakorn Thai and Muanchon -will
align themselves with the former army chief. The four parties are currently
partners in the caretaker government of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa,
whose Chart Thai party was weakened last week when a group led by its
secretary-general, Sanoh Thienthong, defected to the NAP.

Mr Banharn had said he did not expect to become Prime Minister after next
month's polls, but would remain as the leader of Chart Thai.

He has not yet indicated which of the two parties -Democrats and the NAP -his
party will support.

Gen Chavalit was the prime mover in forcing Mr Banharn to announce his
resignation last month in the face of a no-confidence motion in parliament.

Mr Banharn did not honour his pledge and leave office, but instead dissolved
the House and called for fresh elections on Nov 17.

With Mr Tarrin's decision to contest the election, the Democrats will be able
to present a strong economic team which should appeal to the educated
middle-class, an important electoral group in the capital.

Mr Tarrin told a radio interview yesterday that apart from him, former deputy
premier and banker Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, former minister in charge of
energy affairs Dr Savit Bhotiwihok and Democrat party spokesman Abhisit
Vejjajiva would be in the economic team if the Democrats won the right to form
the next government.

A former top banker before entering politics, Mr Tarrin earned high marks as
finance minister in the Chuan government when he took up the Cabinet post as a
non-MP at the invitation of Mr Chuan.

Jakarta detains 24 Taiwanese and Thai fishing boats

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Paul Jacob, Indonesia Correspondent

JAKARTA -Increased patrols by naval ships and military maritime aircraft have
resulted in the detention of 24 Thai and Taiwanese fishing boats which entered
territorial waters in the eastern part of Indonesia last week, the Media
Indonesia newspaper reported yesterday.

The latest intrusions come in the wake of the seizure of 50 fishing boats from
China in the latter half of last month after they entered Indonesian waters
illegally and were found to have had false documents permitting them to fish
in the area.

Indonesian navy chief Vice-Admiral Arief Kushariadi disclosed the latest
round-up of 24 vessels, but without giving a breakdown. He is due to visit the
naval base in Tual, Maluku, where the vessels and 300 Thai and Taiwanese
fishermen are detained.

He said the increased number of fishing boats detained in recent months was
the result of heightened round-the-clock monitoring of east Indonesian waters
by naval patrols and air-force maritime aircraft.

The Indonesian military disclosed last month that ships from its
Surabaya-based Eastern Fleet and other bases would intensify patrols in the
country's resource-rich eastern waters -as well as in the waters around the
Natuna islands where a multi-million-dollar natural gas project was getting
under way.

Vice-Admiral Arief said the Chinese, Taiwanese and Thai vessels detained had
entered Indonesian waters illegally and were fishing in the area using fake
permits.

Permits must be obtained from local authorities and the fact that false
documents had been issued indicated possible collusion between local
businessmen and local authorities, he said.

The question of prosecutions of those detained so far would be left to the
regional office of the Attorney-General, he added. It was no longer a matter
for the navy as the case now also involved the question of how the vessels had
been able to secure fishing permits.

Late last month, the navy reported detaining seven Chinese boats which were
flying the Indonesian flag in waters off the coast of southeastern Maluku -the
first time such a ploy had been detected.

NSTB executive director and surgeon wife die as car hits tree: "Champion of
R&D, and a good friend", "Surgeon well-loved byfriends and patients" and
"Retired teacher pleasant and respected"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Dorothy Ho

Car crash in Perth 

NATIONAL Science and Technology Board executive director Vijay Mehta and his
wife, Dr Amar Kaur, were among three people who died in a car crash near Perth
on Saturday.

They were in a car which was being driven by retired teacher Jaganathan
Govindsamy, 62, when it went out of control and hit a tree, Perth police
confirmed yesterday.

Mr Mehta, 45, his wife, 41, and Mr Jaganathan's wife, Suppamal, a 60-year-old
retired teacher, died on the spot.

Mr Jaganathan was admitted to hospital, and was discharged yesterday.

The Mehtas, who had no children, were in Australia because Dr Amar, the head
of Toa Payoh Hospital's ear, nose and throat department, had been attending a
medical conference in Cairns, Queensland, from Sept 28 to Oct 3.

After the conference, they went to Perth to visit the Jaganathans, who were
old family friends, and stayed with them in their home there.

The Jaganathans' daughter, Rebekah, 27, a church worker, said in a telephone
interview yesterday that her parents had taken the Mehtas out sightseeing on
Saturday when the tragedy occurred.

"They were on their way back from Margaret River when the accident happened,"
she said.

The accident occurred near Busselton, about 250 km south of Perth, according
to the Major Crash Investigation Section of the Perth police, which is
handling the case.

The Jaganathans' white Mazda 626 sedan had split into two on impact, another
family member said yesterday. The couple also have a 28-year-old son, who is
in university.

News of the three deaths shocked colleagues and friends here. NSTB chairman
Teo Ming Kian was among those who paid tribute to Mr Mehta's abilities as an
engineer at the forefront of Singapore's Research and Development efforts.

"Vijay and his wife, Amar, were personal friends. Apart from the loss to the
board, their unfortunate deaths were also a tragic and personal loss to me and
my family," Mr Teo said in a statement.

He said that he had brought Mr Mehta from the Ministry of Defence to the NSTB
in 1993 at a time when it had been experiencing frequent changes in
leadership.

"He brought stability to NSTB. He was looking forward to leading the board
into the second phase of development," Mr Teo added.

Mr Mehta graduated with first class honours in aeronautical engineering from
the University of Manchester and obtained a master's degree from Stanford
University in California.

His wife, the only woman ENT surgeon in Singapore, studied medicine here and
did her postgraduate work in Edinburgh, Scotland, and at Stanford University.

She was active in the Sikh community and was in the midst of planning a clinic
at the Central Sikh Temple.

Several doctors and staff members at Toa Payoh Hospital were in tears
yesterday when they learnt that she had died and some of were too distraught
to speak.

Meanwhile in Perth, police were waiting to interview Mr Jaganathan, who was
resting at home. He had some stitches near one ear, and suffered bruises and a
sore shoulder.

"He does not remember anything," said his daughter, Rebekah.

Car levy on S"poreans : "Reasons not good enough"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

JOHOR BARU -The Malaysian Chinese Association has urged the Johor Baru City
Council to give more valid reasons to collect a M$3 (S$1.70) levy from
Singapore cars entering the country through the Johor causeway.

The Star quoted Johor Baru MCA division secretary Wee Ka Sion as saying: "The
levy should not be imposed as a retaliatory measure against the Singapore
Government for charging Malaysian cars M$30 if they enter the republic more
than five days in a year.

"There has to be a valid reason ... such as to reduce traffic congestion."

He added the MCA division would support the council's intention to study the
imposition of the levy.

"The funds arising from the levy must also be for a good cause such as road
upgrading instead of merely filling up the council's coffers," he said.

Leaders to explore further bridge proposal: Sipadan, Ligitan row to go to
World Court

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

The Mahathir-Suharto meeting

INDONESIA and Malaysia have agreed to explore further the idea of a bridge
linking Peninsular Malaysia and North Sumatra.

Both countries, however, have made it clear that the private sector ought to
come up with capital for the project, which would enhance travel and
communications between Malaysians and Indonesians.

This proposal was among a range of economic and trade issues discussed by
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and President Suharto at a
90-minute meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.

The Indonesian leader was on a two-day visit. He was accompanied by Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas and State Secretary Moerdiono.

At a press conference, Mr Alatas said Indonesia thought the idea of a bridge
from Peninsular Malaysia to North Sumatra was a good one.

It was consistent with planned bridges linking Sumatra with Java and other
parts of Indonesia, he said.

The bridge would also go well with Jakarta's policy of allowing tourists from
neighbouring countries to drive and use their cars in the country.

Mr Alatas said President Suharto and Dr Mahathir also discussed.

* Trade between the two countries. Dr Mahathir noted that while investments in
Indonesia had increased, there was still room for expansion.

Indonesia said that it welcomed investments and hoped that investors showed
interest in the eastern part of the the country and in labour intensive
industries.

* The increasing traffic in the Straits of Malacca. Mr Alatas said that to
alleviate the situation in the straits, Indonesia offered an alternative route
for large ships through the Lombok Straits.

* The World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore. Both leaders agreed that
non-trade related issues such as human rights and labour matters should not be
included. Otherwise, the meeting's agenda would be overloaded.

Mr Alatas was also asked about the reported split among Asean nations on
allowing Myanmar into the grouping.

He said that there was no divergence of opinion on allowing Myanmar in. The
only difference of opinion was when the country should become a member of
Asean.

Indonesia's position was straightforward: if procedures were followed, then it
was prepared to accept Myanmar anytime.

Asked if the human rights record of Myanmar's army junta would be a factor in
determining its membership in Asean, he noted that even the United Nations did
not evaluate the internal situation in a country before allowing it to be a
member.

Action called against sect for "causing families to break up"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

JOHOR BARU -The Malaysian Chinese Association has urged the Home Affairs
Ministry to act against a religious sect for allegedly breaking up families of
its followers.

The Star yesterday quoted the party's Johor Baru division secretary, Mr Wee Ka
Siong, as saying that the group "preaches a lifestyle contrary to local family
values". He did not elaborate.

He said the group had been operating in the state for several years and its
membership was growing.

"We have received several complaints from the Chinese community against the
Taiwan-based group which has brainwashed some people.

"Initial investigations show that many teenagers and wives who joined the sect
have left their homes and cannot be traced.

"There have also been allegations of sect members being told to refrain from
sleeping with non-member spouses," he added.

The sect's leaders also compelled members to coerce their relatives to join
it.

A businessman, Mr Tan Kim Boo, 39, said his 30-year-old wife had been missing
since December last year after joining the sect in 1989. He said she had also
tried to force him to become a member.

"She left saying that she did not want anything to do with me or our
five-year-old son," he said, adding the sect had more than 100 members in Desa
Cemerlang alone.

Retired teacher pleasant and respected: "NSTB executive director and
surgeon wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

THE retired teacher who died in Saturday's accident in Perth was a pleasant
woman who was respected by her students and colleagues alike.

Mrs Suppamal Jaganathan, 60, became a teacher at her alma mater in 1956 after
she graduated from St Hilda's School in 1955.

"She's a very pleasant woman and a very nice person," said Mrs A. Abraham, 59,
an ex-colleague and friend of Mrs Jaganathan.

"It's so sad that she died."

The principal of St Hilda's Secondary School added: "We were all so shocked,
it was so sudden."

Mrs Jaganathan used to teach English and mathematics at St Hilda's Primary
School and was the school's English and library coordinator before retiring in
1989.

Her retirement came just before she emigrated to Perth with her family in
early 1990.

Mrs Abraham, who has known Mrs Jaganathan since 1969, said the retired teacher
visited Singapore regularly even after she moved to Perth.

She had moved there with her husband, Mr Jaganathan Govindsamy, 62, a retired
teacher from Upper Serangoon Technical School, and two children.

Daughter Rebekah, 27, works in a church in Perth, and her son, 28-year-old
Sri, studies aviation at the Edith Cowan University in Perth.

When contacted, Rebekah was too distraught to talk about her mother.

Mrs Jaganathan's niece, Madam Malini Krishna, 38, a teacher at Hai Sing High
School, said that her aunt was a friendly person who was hardworking and
pleasant.

"When friends heard about the accident, those who lived as far away as Sydney
called up the family to ask what had happened," said Madam Krishna.

She added that Mrs Jaganathan's family had planned to come to Singapore for a
wedding next month.

About eight members of the Jaganathan family are already in Perth, said Mrs
Abraham.

They include Mrs Jaganathan's sisters Mrs Kasturi Shanmugan, who works as a
clerk at St Hilda's Secondary School, and Mrs Amurthavalli Naidu, an
ex-principal of Telok Kurau Secondary.

Other family members, Mr and Mrs A. Nathan, also went to Perth. Mr Nathan is
the principal of Upper Serangoon Technical School.

Madam Krishna, who was supposed to leave for Perth today, has cancelled her
trip as she said the family was expected to return soon.

Surgeon well-loved by friends and patients: "NSTB executive director and
surgeon wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

NEWS of the death of Dr Amar Kaur, Singapore's only woman ear, nose and throat
surgeon, left the staff of Toa Payoh Hospital's ENT clinic -including clerks,
nurses and other doctors -shocked and red-eyed.

She was well-loved by both her colleagues and patients, for the care and
concern she showed everyone, and the hospital had given her an award for
excellent service.

Its chief executive, Mr Liak Teng Lit, said that all the staff in the ENT
clinic cried when they received news of her death yesterday morning.

A friend, ENT consultant A. B. John of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said: "I've
never seen a patient who has not had good things to say of her."

Dr Amar, 41, graduated from the then University of Singapore in 1979 and later
went to Edinburgh for a training fellowship.

In 1991, she left to spend a year at Stanford University in California for
advanced training in otolaryngology (ENT).

She spent a year at the Singapore General Hospital after that and left in 1993
to head the ENT division at Toa Payoh Hospital.

Her colleagues, including the former head of SGH's otolaryngology department,
Dr Chew Chuan Tieh, knew her as one of the best ENT surgeons here.

He remembered her as a good team player, who worked tirelessly to help build
the hospital's ENT division.

"When she started about three years ago, there was only one other doctor
besides Dr Kaur in the division. Very often she would be called in the middle
of the night to perform emergency procedures.

"I would see her working at 1 or 2 am. She would work without complaining."

She married Mr Vijay Mehta, the executive director of the National Science and
Technology Board, about three years ago and Mr Liak described them as a loving
couple.

Mr Mehta would visit her frequently at the hospital so that they could have
their lunch together.

Dr Amar was also active in social work in the Sikh community. She was a member
of the Punjabi-Sikh Welfare Council and the head of the council's medical
sub-committee. It had been formed to open an outpatient clinic in the Central
Sikh Temple, in Serangoon Road.

Council chairman Sorinder Singh said he was to have met her yesterday.

He said: "So it came as a terrible shock to me when I got the news on Sunday
night, that she had died."

He described Dr Amar as a woman who would bend over backwards to help others
in need. She had been actively involved in the community's welfare work for
more than 10 years.

The couple's deaths were particularly painful for Dr Aw Chong Yin, senior
registrar at Toa Payoh, who had worked with Dr Amar since 1993.

They had grown close and he had become a close family friend. In fact, the two
doctors attended a medical conference in Cairns in Australia the week before
the accident.

His voice breaking, he said: "I can't believe that they are gone, especially
Amar, she was always so lively and energetic."

Champion of R&D, and a good friend: "NSTB executive director and surgeon
wife die as car hits tree" andPage 22

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee, Allison Lim and Dorothy Ho

Singaporeans killed in Perth crash

Mr Vijay Mehta described as balanced and mature, approachable and good to
staff

PEOPLE who knew Mr Vijay Mehta remembered him yesterday as an outstanding
engineer who championed research and development, and as a good friend who
always had time for people.

Friends and colleagues were shocked by the news that the executive director of
the National Science and Technology Board had died in a three-death car crash
near Perth last Saturday.

Brigadier-General Wesley D'Aranjo, deputy secretary of technology, Ministry of
Defence (Mindef), who knew Mr Mehta for about 20 years, said: "We were very
close friends.

"He was an excellent engineer and a balanced and mature person who was always
willing to listen and consider the alternatives. He was also very approachable
and good to his staff."

Mr Mehta, 45, had worked under BG D'Aranjo in Mindef's Defence Materiel
Organisation before moving to the NSTB. BG D'Aranjo said: "Very rarely did I
see him get angry. He would get angry only on points of principle.

"The defence technology and research development communities in Singapore are
shocked and saddened by his death, and would like to convey their heartfelt
regrets to Mr Mehta's family."

In a statement, the NSTB paid tribute to Mr Mehta, who was seconded from
Mindef before his appointment as its executive director in August 1993.

It said he led the board successfully in several initiatives such as the
Research Incentive Scheme for Companies and the Technology Development Fund.

Between 1991 and 1995, the board secured $2.7 billion in R&D investments from
the private sector, set up 13 national research centres and institutes and
various schemes to encourage innovation and technology commercialisation, and
expanded its R&D manpower pool. During his term, three new research institutes
and centres were set up -the Environmental Technology Institute, Institute of
Molecular Agrobiology and the Centre for Signal Processing.

The board said he had played a key role in charting Singapore's science and
technology directions. He co-chaired the National Science and Technology Plan
Steering Committee, contributing to the formulation of the five-year $4
billion National Science and Technology Plan.

Overseas, he was instrumental in forging strong science and technology links
with Canada, Germany, Israel, India and the United States, and represented
Singapore on the Asean Committee for Science and Technology and in Apec's
senior officials' meeting for science and technology.

He also served on the boards of Singapore Technologies Electronic and
Engineering Limited, Singapore Science Park and National Biotech Committee,
and was an observer on the Economic Development Board's executive committee.
He was awarded a Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 1991.

Professor Su Guaning, director of the Defence Science Organisation and a close
friend, said: "He was a person who could rally people together and get them to
work towards a common goal. He loved life and was a good friend to many."

Mr Lim Swee Say, director of NTUC's administration and research unit, who
co-chaired the National Science and Technology Plan Steering Committee with Mr
Mehta, said: "He laid a clear vision for the future growth of R&D in Singapore
towards the year 2000. He will be fondly remembered and sadly missed by all."

Restaurants now list prices of "extras": "Check it out" and "Prices listed
after customers" grouses"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Dawn Tan

On the menu: Prices of * Peanuts * Pickles * Wet towels * Chinese tea

IF YOU go out to a Chinese restaurant for dinner tonight, be prepared for some
extra items on the menu.

The prices of peanuts, pickles, wet towels and Chinese tea are now being
printed in some restaurants here.

For years these have been accepted as unlisted items for which diners had to
pay. Sometimes these little extras came to as much as $20 for a table of 10.

The change is a result of the Restaurant Association of Singapore's proposal
for its Chinese restaurant-members to list and price these items to avoid
misunderstandings.

The association has about 100 Chinese eateries as members, half the number of
such restaurants in Singapore.

It said it sent out about 120 letters to these members about two months ago
after such items became an issue among consumers earlier this year.

It did not know how many had adopted the proposal. A Straits Times check found
that 14 restaurants have already done so.

They are Tung Lok Sharksfin's eight restaurants, Sin Leong's two restaurants,
Jumbo Serangoon and Jumbo Seafood, Victoria City and Szechuan Garden.

Another nine contacted -the Lucky Restaurants group's six restaurants, Dragon
Phoenix Restaurant and Yunnan Group's two restaurants -said they will be doing
so when they reprint their menus by the end of the year.

The prices of the items vary slightly at the different restaurants. At Dragon
Phoenix, for example, peanuts, towels and Chinese tea come to $17 for a table
of 10.

The Szechuan Garden spokesman said: "This way, it's clear-cut. There won't be
any misunderstanding between the restaurant and our diners."

Jumbo Serangoon's restaurant manager Bernard Chia said: "Customers who
complain usually go to the association. If we inform diners of the prices,
there will be no communication breakdown."

Traditionally, at Chinese restaurants, diners find out how much the extras
cost only when they get the bill. But some people, including tourists, have
complained that this was unfair.

The association's assistant director, Ms Chua Say Khiang, said: "Nowadays,
customers are more vocal and they will speak up if they are not happy.

"If the restaurants state the prices clearly, then they won't have grounds to
complain."

"As time goes by, more restaurants are likely to do so. No restaurant wants to
leave a bad impression on its diners."

But five others contacted -Teochew Garden, May Garden and Tsui Hang Village's
three restaurants -said they did not see the need for the items to be listed,
as they have never had complaints before.

A May Garden spokesman said the restaurant did not face a problem as waiters
ask the diners if they want the "extras" before serving them.

But Lucky Restaurants' group chairman Edmund Loo said: "We are in the service
industry. We cannot keep asking the customer whether he wants this or that.
It's quite rude in front of his guests.

"Stating the prices clearly is the best thing to do."

Tung Lok Sharksfin's (Scotts) restaurant manager Paul Lo said: "Diners expect
to be served appetisers, wet towels and Chinese tea. It's part and parcel of
fine dining in a Chinese restaurant."

Several diners welcomed the move. Administrator Loretta Yeo, 21, said: "Diners
have the right to know the cost of the "extras" before starting their meal
since they are paying for it."

Housewife Amy Tan, 43, noted: "I'd rather patronise a restaurant that is
upfront with me than one which gives me a nasty surprise after the meal."

Prices listed after customers" grouses: "Check it out" and "Restaurants now
list prices of "extras" "

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

SPARKING A CHANGE

A COMPLAINT to The Straits Times prompted the Restaurant Association of
Singapore to start listing the prices of towels and other extras.

A reader complained in the Forum page on May 30 that she felt cheated after
being charged $8 for two plates of Szechuan pickled vegetables at a Chinese
restaurant.

The Consumers Association of Singapore, in its reply, said that restaurants
ought to ask customers if they wanted such "extra" items.

It added that "the most upfront practice was to include the prices on the
menus so that customers will not be taken by surprise and be embarrassed".

It urged the Restaurant Association of Singapore to take the matter up and
regulate practices in the business.

The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board also said then that between August last
year and May this year, three Western tourists had complained about being
charged for items not on the menu.

In July the restaurant association discussed whether to encourage members to
list the prices of the "extras" on the menu, or to ask them to consult their
guests before serving them.

It then sent about 120 letters to its member Chinese restaurants, proposing
that they list the prices of the "extras".

Grandmother"s outstanding volunteer work rubs off on her

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

FOREIGN student Sandy Chan, 14, a Malaysian, has only been living in Singapore
with her paternal grandmother, Madam Leong Ah Say, 61, a housewife, for two
years.

But already, her grandmother's volunteer work with the elderly has had an
impact on her.

About four or five times a week over the past year, she has been helping her
grandmother deliver meals to needy old folk living nearby.

Sometimes, she would even do their housework for them.

On Sunday, she watched proudly as her grandmother received one of nine
outstanding service awards given to befrienders and befriender coordinators by
the Lions Befriender Service Association.

The awards were given to volunteers who had gone beyond the call of duty to
help the lonely elderly with various needs, such as delivery of meals and
housework.

In Madam Leong's case, she received the award for being a consistent volunteer
for the past five years.

She had not only cooked and delivered meals to several elderly people living
nearby, but she had also done their housework and looked after last rites and
funeral arrangements.

Apart from the nine outstanding service awards which were given for the first
time, the association also gave 68 other volunteers fiveand 10-year
long-service awards.

The association is the single largest group of volunteers in Singapore
providing direct service to the elderly.

Started by the Ministry of Community Development in 1982, it was taken over by
the Lions Clubs of Singapore North, Serangoon Gardens and Stamford last year.

It now has 820 volunteers befriending a total of 1,653 elderly people.

Mr Shiva Banerjee, the association's chairman, said that there were plans to
expand its programme to reach out to more of the 20,000 lonely elderly living
in Singapore.

"The people we are serving now are only the tip of the iceberg," he said.

On Sunday, in front of a crowd of more than 800 volunteers, Lions Club
members, ministry officials and grassroots leaders, Mr Sidek Saniff, Senior
Minister of State for Education and guest of honour at the occasion, praised
the award recipients.

On helping others, Mr Sidek said: "I have always remembered something which my
father told me. When you help people, forget about it. Try to think of what
you have yet to contribute, of people that you have yet to help. But if people
help you, you remember it until your last breath."

If Singaporeans had this kind of value system, then they would become caring,
he said.

Retirees to pay only $18 to keep club membership

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Ahmad Osman

SUCCESSFUL PROTEST

RETIREES in the Civil Service Club will continue to pay an annual fee of only
$18 if they do not want to use its facilities with their families.

Those who opt for free supplementary membership for their spouses and up to
three unmarried children between 12 and 21 years old have to pay more from Jan
1 next year.

The amount is $6 per month or $72 annually for those who used to work in
Divisions One, Two and Three in the public sector.

It will remain at $3 every month or $36 each year for former Division Four
officers.

There is a one-time administrative charge of only $10 for each supplementary
card for a family member under the two-tier ordinary membership scheme
starting next year.

The new option was offered to all 1,846 retirees by the club general manager,
Mr Chan Foon Chee, last Saturday.

He told them last month that they would lose their membership if they did not
join the scheme offering a package "which could not be obtained anywhere".

It was meant to boost the club's membership of 9,895 and attract more members
to use facilities in three clubhouses which were under-utilised on weekdays.

Some retirees protested that the scheme would force those who could not afford
the new fees to leave the club.

They also complained that it was unfair to make them pay more when the annual
fees would be halved to $72 for Division One officers.

The Government Pensioners' Association, Singapore, wrote two letters urging
the club to allow retirees drawing small monthly pensions to continue paying
$18 per year.

They should not be deprived of "the only affordable club available to us",
association secretary Thampoo Panjacharam said.

He noted that the cut in the fees for those in the higher divisional status
showed that the club was concerned about the need to recruit such people as
members.

These officers, he argued, would be able to pay the fees even after they
retired because of their enhanced pensions.

"Many of us who retired prior to Jan 1, 1982, are not that lucky," he wrote to
Mr Chan last week.

"It is this group of pensioners who need succour in such things as social
activities and entertainment," he said.

He said later that the option was welcomed by retirees who did not go to the
club regularly and did not need the family package.

These people, he added, should be allowed to continue paying the $18 annual
fee for themselves.

Two retirees said they would become ordinary members as the fees from next
year were cheap.

"I do not mind paying $6 every month. It is very cheap," said Mr O.Y. Chan, a
retired police superintendent.

Said Mr Wong Keng Pun, a retired senior Customs superintendent: "The
facilities offered by the club are comparable to those in other clubs. My
three children are all above 21 years, but my wife will benefit from the new
scheme."

School's English project lets pupils' voices be heard

FOUR Primary 5 pupils, who wrote to the school newsletter as part of an
English project, ended up improving not just their language skills, but also
the life of a schoolmate.

Their suggestion, that a ramp be built to help a mother who carried her
disabled daughter up some steps to her class every day, was taken up by the
school.

Shuqun Primary also replaced the harsh ringing of the school bell with a
musical chime, acting on a suggestion from another pupil.

The pupils have been dropping these suggestions into a letter-box at the feet
of a cardboard cut-out of a parrot called Chatterbox.

Eight teachers compile the letters, jokes, riddles, essays and poems for a
newsletter called Chat-a-Away, which is distributed throughout the school
every term.

The newsletter is part of the school's English project called Joy-Write. It
was introduced in 1992 to help the school's 1,900 pupils improve their writing
skills.

Principal Wong Chwee Neo said the main aim of the project was to publish
children's work. The idea of having an audience, she said, was an incentive
for the children to write.

Madam Wong presented the English project at the 11th Sharing of Experiences
for primary school principals on Saturday. The session was organised by the
Primary School Professional Committee.

In an interview yesterday, Madam Wong said: "The children can express their
feelings this way and we have come to know them better.

"Chat-a-Way is now seen as being part of the school identity."

The school receives an average of 120 letters a term, or about five per class.

In them, children ask for advice on school matters such as managing their
studies and also on personal issues such as coping with parents who seem to
favour one child over another.

One child wrote to say that the school should look for a mate for the lonely
rabbit in the school's eco-garden, while another asked for help as her father
wanted to throw out five cats.

Miss Bong Mui Yoke, 33, the teacher in charge of the newsletter, said the
teachers edited the grammar but not the content of the children's
contributions. They also wrote the replies and occasionally took on the role
of an agony aunt.

Miss Bong said: "It is a lot of work but it is a great chance for pupils to
speak their minds.

"They will speak up once they know that there is an audience. Even if it is
the teachers who read it when the work doesn't get published."

Besides the newsletter, the pupils' works are published in class magazines,
the school publications and personal files.

After the final-year examinations, about 40 pupils function as an editorial
team to publish their class magazines.

All these efforts, said Madam Wong, have helped to improve the English
results.

At the Primary School Leaving Examinations, the number of A*/A grades has been
climbing, from about 30 per cent in 1993 to 46 per cent in 1995.

Woman living alone found murdered

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Jasbir Singh

A WOMAN was found dead in her Ang Mo Kio flat on Friday night in a case which
the police have classified as murder.

Madam Karamjeet Kaur, 52, was discovered by her 22-year-old daughter, student
nurse Kavita Pal Kaur, lying on the kitchen floor of her three-room flat at
around 11 pm.

She had deep cuts on her forehead and upper lip.

Madam Karamjeet had been living alone after her mother, Madam Harnam Kaur, and
Miss Kavita moved out of the Ang Mo Kio flat two months ago.

According to Madam Karamjeet's brother, Mr Dhillon J., 42, Miss Kavita visited
the flat that day because she felt that something bad had happened to her
mother after receiving a call from her mother's friend.

Said Mr Dhillon yesterday: "Normally, my sister would call her good friend,
who lives in Kembangan, to chit-chat. But that day she did not."

The friend, who wanted to be identified only as Madam J. Kaur, told The
Straits Times: "It was surprising that on Friday she did not call. Even my
maid was surprised. I tried to call her several times that day but nobody
picked up the phone.

"After trying since morning, I finally told her daughter, Kavita, at around 9
pm to check on her mother."

"I was worried that she may have had an asthma attack," added the 47-year-old
housewife.

"Karamjeet used to call frequently ever since she began to live alone over the
last two months," she said.

The two women have been close friends since childhood.

Miss Kavita's uncle, Mr Mehinder S., 44, said: "She told me that when she
arrived at the flat she found the iron gate unlocked. But the main door was
still securely fastened.

"When she entered the flat she found the whole place ransacked.

"The telephone was disconnected and she found her mother's body lying on the
kitchen floor."

Mr Mehinder is another brother of Madam Karamjeet.

Miss Kavita immediately called the ambulance. Her mother was pronounced dead
by the ambulance team around 11.30 pm.

Police are investigating.

Man posed as cop and tried to extort money

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  In The Courts

A MAN who posed as a police officer was sentenced yesterday to two years' jail
and given four strokes of the cane for attempted extortion.

District Judge F.G. Remedios heard that Mr Rejak, a construction carpenter,
approached Tan Ah Chong, 25, on March 31 and asked for directions. Tan claimed
to be a police officer and told him to go to a nearby void deck.

There he took Mr Rejak's wallet and also demanded money.

He became angry when he found out that Mr Rejak had no money.

He then took his watch.

He also told the construction carpenter to get $200 from his quarters in
exchange for his work permit, which Tan had taken.

When a policeman on patrol duty arrived at the scene, Mr Rejak told him what
had happened.

The policeman arrested Tan after finding Mr Rejak's watch on him.

Tan has five previous convictions for theft, drug consumption, possession of
offensive weapons and fraudulent possession of property.

The maximum punishment for extortion is five years' jail and caning.

86-year-old man sues daughter for return of Tiong Bahru shop

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  In The Courts

By Elena Chong

AN 86-YEAR-OLD man is suing his daughter for the return of a shop in Kim Tian
Road which she said was a gift to her.

Mr Cheng Buck Qui, a former provision shop owner, said in his statement of
claim that he was influenced by his daughter, Madam Cheng Muay alias Cheng Lee
Weng, 54, a housewife, into signing a letter of instruction to a lawyer to
transfer the property to her in June 1990.

A month later, he also signed another document for the property to be
transfered to her for $420,000.

But it is his case that no money was paid. Neither had he given the shop to
her as a gift.

Opening Mr Cheng's case yesterday, counsel Tay San Lee told Judicial
Commissioner Lim Teong Qwee that when his client signed the documents, he did
not have the benefit of independent legal advice, or knew what he was signing.

Mr Cheng had a severe hearing impairment, and was illiterate.

Mr Tay said it was not disputed that his client and his late wife, Madam Koo
Beng Eng, bought the property in 1962 for $36,000.

It was mortgaged to a bank in 1968 to get overdraft facilities for Mr Cheng.

In January 1990, 2-1/2 years after Madam Koo's death, Madam Cheng paid $20,000
to discharge the mortgage on the property.

In June and July 1990, she and her father went to the office of Messrs Peter
Mowe & Partners to sign the papers relating to the transfer of the Kim Tian
Road property, which is off Tiong Bahru Road.

Mr Cheng is seeking a declaration that the transfer be set aside due to the
undue influence of Madam Cheng, who has denied this.

Madam Cheng's case is that her father had intended to transfer the property to
her as a gift, and that the letter that he signed was based on his
instructions to the lawyer.

Cross-examined by Madam Cheng's lawyer, Mr Chandra Mohan, Mr Cheng's adopted
son, 47-year-old cabby Cheng Liang Choon, denied that he had instigated his
father to bring the action against Madam Cheng.

Mr Chandra Mohan had suggested that Liang Choon had hoped that Madam Cheng
would offer some money to her father who would then hand it over to him.

Asked why his father wanted to mortgage the property to obtain a loan, Liang
Choon said his father had no money and wanted to help him as he was indebted.

He said he had stopped his pork rib soup business since end-1994 to look after
his father.

Liang Choon, who obtained a taxi licence four months ago, admitted that he had
lost more than $1 million betting on horses, and that his father used to pay
his gambling debts.

Asked how much his present gambling debts were, he answered that they were
about $100,000.

The hearing continues.

A fine example: At least a third of regular volunteers are 30 or younger /
Children"s Cancer Foundation

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

* MEDICAL officer Tan Hiang Khoon was only 25 years old when, in the course of
his volunteer work with chronically ill children, he heard that parents with
cancer-stricken children had voiced the need for a support group.

Dr Tan, then a houseman, decided to rope in six other young volunteers to help
meet this need. This was five years ago.

Since then, the welfare group they set up -Working in Aid of Leukaemic Kids,
now known as the Children's Cancer Foundation -has grown from strength to
strength.

Dr Tan, now 29 and chairman of the foundation's management committee, said the
foundation served 195 families, compared to only 30 then.

Where previously there were only five volunteer counsellors who worked on an
ad-hoc basis, there are now four full-time social workers and another 15
volunteer counsellors.

Recalling the difficult times then, Dr Tan said: "We had no money, and no
credibility. As a young organisation, it was difficult to convince people to
donate money."

The programmes, he said, were also far from satisfactory.

Counselling services were run completely by volunteers who also had to cope
with their full-time jobs. He said: "The counsellors' main job then was to
offer a listening ear. More serious problems were referred to relevant
agencies."

Now, apart from counselling services and social outings for parents and
children, the foundation also organises parent support groups, workshops and
seminars, and provides financial assistance to families to help bear the costs
of chemotherapy.

Despite his busy work schedule, he still manages to spend an average of five
hours a week working for the foundation.

He said: "Once you get into the system, it becomes a part of your life and a
part of you. I don't feel as if I have to give up other things in my life to
do this work."

At least a third of regular volunteers are 30 or younger: A fine example

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Julie Kee

Is the post-65 generation concerned only with chasing the five Cs? Recently,
Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law and
Home Affairs, cited the 1990 census report, which found that a higher
proportion of teenagers volunteer for community service than any other age
group. Professor Tommy Koh, Ambassador at Large, also said many were willing
to give up their time to help others. Julie Kee checked the volunteer profile
of seven welfare bodies, and spoke to one young volunteer who helped set up a
charity organisation in his spare time.

Not all young people are materialistic, say welfare groups

NOT all young people are materialistic and concerned only with chasing the
five Cs, said staff members of seven welfare groups The Straits Times
interviewed.

At least one out of three people who volunteer their services regularly at
these welfare bodies are 30 years old or younger -born after 1965.

And in one case, the proportion even goes up to four in five.

This makes them an important manpower resource in a field that is highly
dependent on volunteers, they said.

The post-65 generation forms 47 per cent of Singapore's population, and the
number is estimated at 1.42 million.

The National Council of Social Service, which categorises its volunteers by
their occupations, said that this year, 33.7 per cent of the people who signed
up for its volunteer placement programme were students.

Another 55.1 per cent were working adults and professionals, while housewives
formed 10.7 per cent, and retirees made up 0.5 per cent.

The council found that despite their youth, young volunteers did not restrict
themselves to any particular type of community work.

Ms Theresa Lee, divisional manager of the council's Volunteer Action and
Development Centre, said: "Students generally want to volunteer to work with
children and young people.

"However, we do see a growing interest by students towards working with the
elderly and the disabled."

In the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled in Singapore, (Minds), young
working adults below 30 years old make up half the volunteer pool.

Mr Aaron Ng, executive director of Minds, said that young volunteers were
important because they provided much-needed help in activities which were
labour-intensive.

Their role as volunteers, he said, complemented those in the older age groups
who tended to offer managerial expertise.

In the Singapore Volunteers Overseas Programme run by the Singapore
International Foundation, about one-third of the people who sign up are from
the post-65 generation.

Participants usually take leave of absence or resign from their jobs to serve
as volunteers.

They are paid a living allowance of about $400 a month and sent to developing
countries such as Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam, Botswana and Ghana to provide
humanitarian and technical assistance.

Miss Low Lih Jeng, the programme's assistant director, said: "The spirit of
altruism comes out very strongly.

"If these young people did not come forward, it would definitely have affected
the success of our programme."

On whether today's youth were materialistic, she said: "I think a lot of young
people want to help but it's a matter of balancing work commitments with
volunteer work."

According to Mrs Geri Lau, secretary-general of the Singapore Red Cross
Society, it was not wrong for young people to put a premium on striving hard
in their careers and being competitive.

"This is necessary for a vibrant society," she said.

Troubled Tories hope much from conference: Senior Tory party member
defects

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Neville Stack in London

THE Conservative Party hopes that its last conference before the general
election will be a jolt of adrenaline.

But even the managers, who usually succeed in keeping the conference running
demurely along party lines, will be hard put to disguise the faults that
sunder the party from the Cabinet down.

Add to that the usual crop of financial-sleaze scandals to set Tory tongues
wagging, in private at any rate, and the scenario looks pretty bleak for the
conference, which begins in earnest today in Bournemouth with the arrival of
the Prime Minister.

There have been dozens of critical resolutions tabled on the leadership's
policy over Europe and monetary union. But few will survive the chairman's
pruning knife, and whatever criticisms voiced will be tentative.

The conference, both on the floor and in the side-show meetings, will be
dominated by the issue of Europe and what to do about it.

It is the perceived loss of sovereignty which would follow the adoption of
economic and monetary union (EMU) that is obsessing Conservatives.

Prime Minister John Major, with the support of most of his Cabinet, is keeping
his powder dry prudently (as is opposition leader Tony Blair) and not making
any decisions until he has to. But that does not suit his rebel faction, now
grown to nearly half his parliamentary and grassroots party.

Whipped on by the xenophobic right-wing press, the Europhobes will demand that
he rule out EMU for the life of the next parliament.

He will not concede.

If he does, his Euro-enthusiast Chancellor (Finance Minister) Kenneth Clarke
will resign and set up his own caucus of the Tory left -and that will split
the party asunder and lose it all chances at the general election.

Mr Clarke, a genial verbal bruiser, has told his friends that he will relish
the chance of a conference confrontation with the party dissidents, one that
his high office precludes in the House of Commons.

The Daily Mail's political columnist Simon Heffer is not alone in the media in
taking a sour view of the whole affair.

"In a sensible party, the last conference before an election is used to set
out the programme on which that conference will be fought," he wrote. "In
their highly successful conference at Blackpool, Labour did just that.

"The party that comes to Bournemouth will be immersed instead in a soup of
introspection, flavoured with dollops of defeatism, despair and recrimination
 ... the ideas-free zone that the party has become will disappoint those who
want a new, powerful message to take to the people."

The sub-text to all this manoeuvring is: What happens after the election? That
is the hidden agenda that will dominate the conference.

The polls continue to predict that Labour will sweep in, but wiser heads
-including Mr Blair's -are not so confident. Tory sheep scurry back to the
fold when they scent the Labour wolf.

But assuming the Tory death-wish comes true and it loses, Cabinet ministers
Michael Portillo and Michael Howard will battle with leadership challenger
John Redwood for the hearts and wallets of the right.

Mr Clarke and deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine will line up on the
left, alongside that doughty octogenarian former premier Sir Edward Heath. But
this disregards, as many unwisely do, the Prime Minister's calibre.

Mr Major will point to the rapid improvement in the economy and the standard
of living, Britain's many competitive advantages and the fall in unemployment.
He will be optimistic about the years ahead. He will be wary of Europe's
machinations but not hostile.

He is no charismatic orator, as Tony Blair is. But in his own dogged, steady
way, he is in tune with the millions of similar people in the mythical
constituency called Middle England.

The writer covers European developments and issues for The Straits Times.

Chris Patten"s last hurrah

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

HONGKONG Governor Chris Patten's valedictory address to the Legislative
Council (Legco) last week was expectedly dramatic. It was his last annual
policy address on Hongkong; it was the last any British Governor would make
there; and the forum was no other than the elected Legco, the main point of
contention between the outgoing colonial authorities and China, to which the
territory will revert next year. Beijing, which says that Mr Patten's
electoral reforms violate the 1984 Sino-British treaty on Hongkong, has vowed
to abolish the Legco, elected last year for a four-year term, and replace it
with a provisional chamber. Mr Patten's opposition to the provisional
legislature, and his impassioned defence of the existing one, was summed up in
his question: "How can you have complete faith in the future of the rule of
law if you worry about the integrity of the institution which makes the laws?"

Now, the belief in the need for the rule of law is eminently justified, of
course; the problem lies in equating it with Legco's continued existence. No
one would deny the need for an independent judiciary, which protects not only
the man on the street but also trade and industry, by enforcing contractual
and other legal obligations without which a highly-developed economy is
impossible to sustain. The rule of law also ensures the probity of government
in what is the world's eighth largest trading community. No one would deny the
need for a meritocratic civil service, which administers Hongkong with quiet,
predictable efficiency. Were that efficiency to be subordinated to
extra-professional considerations, the consequences for the territory's way of
life would be seen ultimately in its economic bottomline as well.

Not only is all this true, but also, Beijing knows it as much as the departing
authorities do. But what China knows, and they continue to refuse to accept,
is that their political blueprint for the colony, made in the teeth of
Beijing's opposition, is not the sole repository of these safeguards. The
point is whether the rule of law prevails; to make it conditional on the
continuance of Legco will get Hongkong nowhere. As a matter of principle,
Beijing is opposed to an institution that rejects the spirit and purpose of
the 1984 joint accord. As a matter of practice, it is idle to believe that
China will not carry out its threat to disband Legco. Indeed, the rule of law
existed in Hongkong before the arrival of the elected council. Why, then,
place so much in the care of an institution that was not guaranteed to come
into existence and which is doomed to fail? What is achieved by saying that a
smooth transition in 1997 is not an end in itself, a successful transition, as
smooth as possible, being what is necessary? Why rub in the point by laying
down benchmarks by which others will apparently judge Hongkong after 1997?

More productive were Mr Patten's reference to the fundamentals of Hongkong's
success -the hard work and skill of its people, its beneficent administration
under the rule of law, its openness to the world -and his pledge of assistance
to his successor, the Chief Executive-designate, who is expected to be chosen
by the end of this year. For Hongkong's enduring qualities to thrive after the
handover, it will need to enjoy economic autonomy. The Chief Executive must
ensure, and must be seen to be ensuring, that it does so. To do his job, he
must have China's confidence, because it is this that will give him the
wherewithal to stand up for Hongkong when necessary. What is good is that this
co-operation is only to be expected. Hongkong's autonomy is in the interests
of both the territory and China and, indeed, these interests will converge
even more closely after 1997. This makes it natural for the mainland to let
the territory do business its own way. Hongkong's well-wishers hope that it
will continue on this natural trajectory without political obstacles coming in
the way. Ultimately, its future lies with China.

S46"s self-dissolution -the final episode in 7-year political adventure

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Brendan Pereira in Kuala Lumpur

ON SUNDAY, the Parti Melayu Semangat 46 (S46) general assembly created
political history in Malaysia when it became the first party to pass a motion
for self-dissolution.

This ended its seven-year adventure in the political landscape and paved the
way for its members to rejoin Umno.

Despite the brave talk of party leaders and delegates at the special general
assembly of disbanding in a position of strength, facts seem to suggest that
it faced only two choices: Either reunite with the stronger and more
widely-accepted Umno or slide into political oblivion.

Consider these facts: In the 1990 general elections, a year after it was
formed, S46's candidates managed to win six Parliamentary seats and 12 state
seats.

Five years later, it performed miserably in all states, save for Kelantan,
where S46 candidates won 11 seats on the state assembly.

Even party president Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a Kelantan strongman since the
70s, was not spared the swing in votes.

He won his Gua Musang parliamentary seat on a reduced majority of 4,746 votes,
compared to the 8,980 before.

In his speech at the general assembly, deputy president Datuk Rais Yatim
recognised this erosion of support. Speaking to 500 delegates on Sunday, he
noted that S46 had spent the last few years trying to oppose Umno.

But the party's message and struggle were only effective and accepted in
Kelantan and a few places on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

He said: "From statistics, the two elections gave Umno nearly three million
votes, 440,000 for PAS and 600,000 for S46."

Umno and PAS (Parti Islam) politicians say that the party was headed for a
heavy and potentially crippling defeat at the next elections.

Said an Umno Youth politician: "The euphoria of starting a new party with a
common enemy was getting weaker. This was evident at branch level where many
members had seemed to have lost the fire and crossed over to Umno."

PAS was even more damning in its assessment of the political survival of its
former ally in the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah. Kelantan Mentri Besar Datuk Nik
Aziz Nik Mat, scoffing at S46's chances of denting its hold on the state, told
The Straits Times: "S46 will be lucky if it can win a few seats in the next
elections. If its candidates fight head-on with PAS candidates, it will have
less than 10 seats in the state assembly."

An exaggeration perhaps but observers say that the slightly built religious
teacher was not very far off the mark.

They noted that the main problem with the party was that it had lost much of
its relevance. It was born at a time when Malay politics was at its lowest
ebb.

In 1987, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah challenged Umno president and Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad unsuccessfully for the party president's post.
He then took the matter to court on the ground that some delegates who voted
were ineligible.

A year later, the High Court declared Umno illegal and the main vehicle of
Malay unity was de-registered. Umno Baru was set up by Dr Mahathir while
Tengku Razaleigh formed S46.

Against this backdrop, there were accusations of corruption and money politics
being hurled by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah's camp against Dr Mahathir and his
supporters.

During this time of great disunity, the S46 filled a vacuum for many former
Umno members who felt that the party had lost its way and was not looking
after the interests of the Malays.

There was also a tremendous feeling of sympathy towards S46 after elder Malay
statesmen such as the late Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tun Hussein Onn were
blacklisted and not allowed to join the new Umno.

Two years later, these feelings of anger and frustration turned into protest
votes at the general elections.

In Kelantan, the National Front led by Umno tasted its worst defeat, losing in
all 39 state and 13 parliamentary seats. More importantly, it gave up control
of the east coast state which it had ruled since 1978.

Mr Hassan Harun, an Umno Supreme Council member and a Kelantanese, said: "What
happened in 1990 was a show of anger and protest by the voters. I do not think
that it was because of S46's or PAS' election platform."

Following that election, however, things changed. S46 realised that it was
very much a second-class citizen in the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah in Kelantan,
which it formed with PAS, Berjasa and Hamim.

The Islamic party was slowly exerting control over all policies in the state,
sometimes with total disregard for its ally.

This alienated some S46 leaders such as Datuk Ibrahim Ali, Datin Paduka
Rahimah Osman, Datuk Harun Idris and Ms Marina Yusof, who left the party.

At the same time, under the leadership of Dr Mahathir, the Malaysian economy
soared.

Double-digit economic growth created jobs and opportunities for everyone. A
new breed of Malay entrepreneurs were created, giving the community immense
pride and a larger share of the economy.

The feel-good factor was evident among Malaysians who spurned even traditional
opposition parties such as the DAP (Democratic Action Party) and returned the
National Front to power with a large majority.

Thorny issues of money politics and corruption within Umno were met head-on by
Dr Mahathir. Some party members were expelled after being found guilty of
using money to buy political patronage.

The battle to curb this disease is still very alive with Dr Mahathir banning
all candidates for the Umno elections this week from campaigning.

On Sunday, he told delegates to pick only clean leaders so that the party
could eradicate money politics.

Bit by bit, the raison d'etre of S46 was being chipped away, a fact
acknowledged by Datuk Rais.

He noted: "Our issues and the focus of our struggles between 1987 and 1990 is
not given much weight by Malays. The two elections have proven this fact.

"The change in the environment, the attitude and economic values have played a
role. Economic change has played the main role in changing the view and
struggle of Malays and Malaysians."

Tengku Razaleigh was even more frank. He said: "The reality that Umno is
strong and accepted by the public has to be accepted."

But factors beyond the party's control were only one dimension of the slide in
the party's fortunes. It also suffered from an image problem.

Many of the party' stalwarts were former Umno members who had held federal
ministers' posts. These included Tengku Razaleigh, Datuk Rais and Datuk Manan
Osman.

They were not in the mould of Mr Lim Kit Siang or Mr Karpal Singh and could
not galvanise the opposition or gain wide acceptance as members of the
opposite bench.

In the end, they were neither seen as a National Front party nor as an
effective opposition.

Its stand on the powers of the Malay rulers also alienated a number of its
supporters and the public. When there was a groundswell of feeling against the
excesses of the sultans and when the federal government moved to pass
legislation removing their legal immunity, S46 did not support the motion.

The party stated that the special role of the Malay rulers was important to
protect the rights of the Malays and Islam. However, there was talk that the
rejection of the legislation had more to do with Tengku Razaleigh's close
links to the Kelantan Palace.

The final nail in the coffin was its poor choice of political allies, ranging
from DAP to PAS.

Neither of these parties shared its political goal: to be in the forefront of
Malay nationalism. In fact, PAS eschews nationalism in any form. It regards it
as assabiyah, a form of racism.

Not surprisingly, S46 fell out with its allies. In Kelantan, it was not
consulted on many issues and made to look incompetent.

This year, the PAS-led government decided that all eating shops should be
barred from opening before 3 pm. This did not go down so well with non-Malay
shopkeepers.

Even decisions to ban wayang kulit, carnival rides and unisex hair salons were
not taken in consultation with S46 leaders.

The unpopularity of some of these decisions cost S46 candidates a huge chunk
of non-Malay votes in the 1995 elections.

Worse still, its threats to leave the Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah were laughed
off by PAS.

Said Mr Wan Ismail Wan Jusoh, press secretary to the Mentri Besar, Datuk Nik
Aziz: "We do not bow to threats. They were a party on the way down, losing
support on the ground every day."

Seeing the writing on the wall, the leaders decided to dissolve the party and
reunite with Umno.

As Tengku Razaleigh noted: "The party is only a tool to serve and achieve a
higher objective, that is to realise the goals of religion, the race and the
nation."

THE legal sub-committee of the National Internet Advisory Committee will
discuss the issue of privacy in cyberspace, said its chairman Lee Seiu Kin of
the Attorney-General's Chambers.

After a recent case in which a man was fined $61,500 for downloading smut off
the Internet, some Internet users here were concerned that they were being
tracked.

This was despite assurances by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority that
individuals' movements on the Internet were not being monitored.

Mr Lee said: "If many people feel this way, then this will not be good for the
development of the Net so we want to look at how we can allay these concerns."

The deputy director of the AG's Chambers civil and international affairs
divisions said he was in the process of forming the team.

He said it was likely that the legal sub-group would include members from
outside the main committee, who would provide a good balance of ideas.

An avid surfer himself, he often combs the World Wide Web for four or five
hours a night, "to get an idea of what is out there". He also makes use of the
Internet, especially e-mail, in his daily legal work.

He made it clear that he saw the need for some amount of Internet regulation.

He revealed that, at its first meeting a week ago, the committee was shown
some of the pornographic web sites which have been blocked under SBA content
guidelines. He said quite simply: "I wouldn't want my children to see that."

Nonetheless, like his fellow committee members, he sees the Internet as a
potent force to be taken advantage of.

Committee to allay fears

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Raoul Le Blond

THE new National Internet Advisory Committee (NIAC) will look into issues such
as privacy in cyberspace and promote the use of Internet services such as
electronic mail.

It will also help to fine-tune Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) rules
for the Internet here.

The NIAC chairman, Associate Professor Bernard Tan, sketched its directions at
a press conference yesterday.

He said the 19-member group, appointed by the Ministry of Information and the
Arts (Mita) recently for a two-year term, had held its first meeting a week
ago.

The body will look at information provided on the Internet, as well as
electronic bulletin boards.

It will advise the SBA on Internet rules, but would not be involved in the
day-to-day policing, he said.

The rules are aimed at keeping out objectionable content, such as pornography
and politically inflammatory material.

The NIAC will look at the ways Internet usage is affected by the rules, and
whether there is a need to fine-tune them.

"The SBA regulations are not cast in stone," he said. But he stressed that his
committee could only make recommendations.

Prof Tan, who is also the dean of the National University of Singapore's
Science faculty, said that three sub-committees had been formed.

These would gather feedback on users' concerns, and come up with ways to
educate the public on the Internet.

The sub-groups are the:

* Legal sub-committee headed by Mr Lee Seiu Kin, senior state counsel and
deputy head (civil division) and (international affairs division),
Attorney-General's Chambers;

* Industry sub-committee headed by Mr Johnny Moo, group managing director of
Computer Systems Advisors Group;

* Public education subcommittee, led by Mr Tan Yap Kwang, director of the
Education Ministry's planning division.

One of the first areas the NIAC will study is the effect that proxy servers
are having on Internet access here.

Proxy servers are devices, installed in computer networks, which speed up
access to often-accessed Web pages.

They are also used here to block sites which the SBA deems objectionable.

Since Sept 15, Internet Access Service Providers here have required public
subscribers to use proxy servers, prompting some users to complain about
slower access.

Another area that the NIAC would study is promoting the wider use of Internet
services.

Prof Tan said: "While a lot of attention has been focused on the use of the
World Wide Web, we want to encourage the use of electronic mail among the
wider population."

He added that the committee would also work to heighten the public's awareness
about the Internet and its potential.

With its members coming from a broad range of professions -the law, government
bodies, schools and industry -the committee was well-placed to gather
feedback, he said.

There are about 100,000 Internet subscribers here. But equally important were
the views of those who do not use the Internet regularly, such as parents of
children who are avid surfers.

He said much of the discussion about the Internet was misinformed, and that
the committee would work to correct this.

SM Lee, Major hold "very friendly" meeting: Singapore model comes as a
package -take it or leave it

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Neville Stack in London

SENIOR Minister Lee Kuan Yew called on British Prime Minister John Major at
Number 10, Downing Street, yesterday.

Mr Major had returned on Saturday from the European Summit in Dublin and was
preparing to leave for the crucial Conservative Party conference in
Bournemouth.

"Mr Major made great efforts to meet Senior Minister Lee," a diplomatic source
said.

The Straits Times understands that Mr Major was working on the keynote speech
that he will deliver at the Tory conference.

"The meeting was very friendly and constructive and it centred on the growth
of opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region," said a Downing Street source.
"They discussed opportunities for Singapore-British trade."

Mr Lee later met the British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, former
president of the Board of Trade.

And he spoke at a private luncheon of the influential Chairmen's Club at the
Berkeley Hotel.

Mr Lee, who is on a private visit to England, invited Mr Tony Blair, leader of
the opposition Labour Party, to dinner last night.

Today, Mr Lee will give a talk at Asia House, a forum for economic, commercial
and cultural activities linking Asia and Europe.

Let people know what ingredients go into food

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

I REFER to the letter "McDonald's should say how food is cooked" (ST, Aug 28).

I was shocked to learn that beef extract is used for french fries and hash
browns. I am surprised that McDonald's has not responded to date.

Do other fast-food outlets also use beef extract in their cooked food? I also
understand that most cheese contains beef.

Consumers who do not eat beef for religious or health reasons are not aware of
this. They should be told what ingredients go into foodstuff.

5-day week won"t be standard practice in Civil Service

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MS JENNI HO, in her letter "Benefits in shorter work week" (ST, Sept 27),
suggested that Government should take the lead in implementing a five-day week
for civil servants.

The Prime Minister, in response to a question on a five-day week at a forum in
April this year, stated that "... this should be left to the market to decide
and that the Government would not set the tone by allowing the Civil Service a
five-day week and encouraging other employers to do so".

Statistics from the Ministry of Labour show that two-thirds of private-sector
organisations work a 5.5-day week or even longer. The table (right) gives the
1995 work-week figures for clerical, sales, service, production and related
employees.

The Civil Service will not adopt a five-day work-week as a standing practice.

But ministries may adopt flexible work-week arrangements where this will
improve the level of service to the public.

For example, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has extended its
service hours to full-day operation on Saturdays. The roster for the six-day
service is such that counter officers work five days a week, including
alternate Saturdays.

Many supervisors turn up for work every Saturday as their staff are on duty.

Give clear reply on cyclists" behaviour

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE reply from the Land Transport Authority (ST, Oct 4) in response to
readers' views on the irresponsible road behaviour of cyclists on our roads is
lame, to say the least.

It ignores the concerns of many road users, who wonder whether cyclists have
to follow traffic regulations or not. Is the number of accidents involving
cyclists not high enough yet for a proper response?

Ignorance of traffic regulations among cyclists is so prevalent that it is not
uncommon to see Neighbourhood Police Post members making their rounds at night
without a lamp on their bicycles or riding two abreast!

As cyclists tend to ride along pedestrian footpaths and pedestrian crossings,
would the LTA please give a clear and unequivocal reply?

Police will take action against reckless cyclists

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

WE WOULD like to thank the writers of the letters "Cyclists here seem to defy
rules and safety" (ST, Sept 27), "Make safe cycling easier" and "Most cycles
are not fitted with bells" (ST, Sept 30) for their feedback.

In our news release on the accident situation for the first half of this year,
we raised our concern over cyclists, particularly cyclists who are reckless
and behave irresponsibly on the roads.

We take a serious view of such conduct and will not hesitate to take action
against them.

The Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules require, for example, that all bicycles
should have a front lamp and a rear red light or reflector during hours of
darkness.

They also require that bicycles must be ridden in an orderly manner and with
due regard for the safety of others. Action has always been taken against
cyclists who flout these rules.

As for the suggestion to educate cyclists, the Traffic Police have, since
1981, trained primary schoolchildren on safe cycling at the Road Safety Park
at the East Coast Parkway.

Some 10,000 schoolchildren who attend these programmes each year are taught,
among other things, to obey signals and signs to ride safely, and to put on
proper riding attire. The students also play a traffic game simulating road
situations and are given "demerit points" if they fail to comply with the
traffic rules.

Road safety talks are conducted at schools, community clubs and other
grassroots organisations. We will continue to place emphasis on education and
explore new ways to undertake this.

The Traffic Police are monitoring closely the accident rate involving cyclists
and will continue with their enforcement action. In the meantime, we would
like to remind all cyclists to keep to the traffic laws for their own safety,
as well as that of other road-users.

Exempt some donations entirely from estate duty

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

I REFER to your articles (ST, Oct 4) on Mr C.J. Koh's donation of $2 million
to the Universities Endowment Fund.

Although it has been well publicised that the donation is tax-deductible, I
wonder if it is equally well known that such donations would not be exempt
from estate duty if the gift was made during the donor's lifetime unless he
survives for one year after the time of the gift (in the case of a gift to a
public or charitable institution).

Otherwise, the money donated is deemed under the law to still belong to the
donor at the time of his death, and estate duty is chargeable accordingly.

For gifts to non-public or non-charitable institutions, the time frame is five
years.

Under the Estate Duty Act, estate duty is not payable only for gifts of money
to the National Museum; other than that only bequests to five institutions are
exempt from duty. The National University of Singapore is one of the five,
although strangely enough, the Nanyang Technological University is not.

The term "bequest" means that it must be a gift under a will, to be given
after death. Hence gifts during the lifetime of the donor are not exempt.
Therefore, the donor's estate would be liable for estate duty if the donor
dies within the year!

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), it is
provided that estate duty could be recovered from the recipient of the gift.
In the case of a gift to a charity, it seems to me that it defeats the purpose
of the gift if the recipient is required to pay the estate duty.

This leads me to wonder whether the Estate Duty Act should be amended to
exempt totally from estate duty gifts to any public or charitable institution
regardless of when the gifts were made. A bolder move could be to abolish
estate duty altogether as Malaysia did several years ago.

Perhaps this could spur more donations and help the Universities Endowment
Fund meet its $1 billion target more easily and quickly as the Fund will not
have to wait till the demise of donors before getting the donations.

GRCs : Amendment Bill may be unconstitutional

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

ARTICLE 12 (2) of the Republic of Singapore Constitution provides that "except
as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination
against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or
place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment
under a public authority ..."

This provision is in fact qualified by Article 39A which provides that GRCs
may be formed "in order to ensure the representation in Parliament of members
from the Malay, Indian and other minority communities ..."

Another qualification to this is to be found in Article 152(1) which provides
that "it shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for
the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore".

These are all very sound rules to ensure that no one particular majority will
ever come to oppress the minorities in Singapore.

When Mr Lim Boon Heng, Minister without Portfolio, put forward the GRC
proposal in 1987, its objective clearly was to give effect to the Government's
duty to protect minority interests in Singapore.

It was a laudable effort and a sound attempt to maintain the racial and
religious harmony in the country.

However, when the Prime Minister decided recently to introduce an Amendment
Bill (which would become an Act of Parliament or "law" if passed by Parliament
and assented to by the President) to Article 39A, the manifest intention was
to facilitate the institutionalisation of community development councils.

It is this novel rationale that may result in the constitutionality of the
Amendment Bill being suspect.

This issue must be examined carefully prior to the General Election, for it
carries with it serious consequences. Article 4 of our Constitution states
clearly that any "law" which is inconsistent with the Constitution is void.

Prima facie, the GRC concept goes against the equality of race principle
embodied in Article 12(2). The only reason the GRC scheme exists, since its
introduction in 1987, is that the GRC concept seeks to protect the minority
interest (as empowered by Articles 39A and 152(1) respectively). This, as I
pointed out, is of course desirable and legitimate. However, can the same
noble aspirations be ascribed to the recently proposed Amendment Bill?

The Prime Minister's Amendment Bill seeks to decrease the minority
representation in the GRCs from one-quarter to one-sixth. Can this Bill ever
be described sensibly as "to care for the interests of the racial and
religious minorities" under Article 152(1)?

Similarly, since the Prime Minister has already stated openly that the Bill
was introduced to create the necessary critical mass for the CDCs to work, can
this rationale be described sensibly as "in order to ensure the representation
in Parliament of members from the Malay, Indian and other minority
communities" under Article 39A?

If the answers to the above two questions are "no", this Amendment Bill -even
if passed by Parliament -will be struck down by the courts as void for being
unconstitutional. It will certainly be a prima facie contravention of the
"equality of races" principle embodied in Article 12.

It will similarly be outside the scope of either Article 39A or Article
152(1), and will therefore remain void since it does not appear to be an
exceptional case sanctioned by Article 39A or Article 152(1).

The only way to preserve the GRCs' legitimacy is to maintain the present
rationale to protect minority interests without any other extraneous
considerations concerning the CDCs. Consequential to this, the number of MPs
in each GRC should not be increased, otherwise the proportion of minority MPs
would decrease, thus derogating from the original objective of Article 39A.

I may be wrong in my assessment of the legality/constitutionality of this
Bill, but I beg the Prime Minister's indulgence in re-examining it carefully
in order to avoid any unnecessary quagmire. The nation's stability might well
be at stake should Parliament be forced to dissolve as a result.

Bourse fails to rally on back of Wall Street gains: Dow breaches 6,000 for
first time in early trading

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

Column:  Market Report

By Tan Li Eng

THE expected firming of the Singapore bourse on the back of strong Wall Street
gains last Friday failed to materialise, as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index sank 22.2 points to 2,126.66.

Dealers attributed the bearishness to sustained underweighting activity and
poor sentiment.

"The climb in the Dow is not to our advantage because more money will be
poured into the US market rather than the Asian markets, said a dealer with a
foreign brokerage. "Most of the liquidity will be sucked out to the US
market."

Even market newcomer Easyknit International Holdings was not spared the
adverse sentiment, suffering the ignominy of becoming the second offering to
debut below its offer price in a week.

Shares in the Hongkong-based garment manufacturer dropped 5 per cent below its
initial public offer price. It dipped as low as HK$2.60 in intra-day trading,
with 1.74 million shares changing hands, before closing at HK$2.90.

On Friday, Pacific Andes (Holdings) shares fell 6 per cent below its offer
price of 57 US cents. Yesterday, it continued to drift further, ending three
cents down at 50.5 US cents.

Property stocks as a whole also fell, with the SES Properties Index tumbling
12.02 points to 644.59.

News that third quarter private property transactions plunged by 75 per cent
from the previous quarter and comments by Minister for National Development
Lim Hng Kiang that property prices would "adjust downward" over the next six
months further eroded sentiment, said dealers.

City Developments dropped 40 cents to $10.80 on 1.2 million shares traded,
Wing Tai fell two cents to $3.42 on 2.4 million shares, while DBS Land eased
10 cents to $4.52 on 1.3 million shares.

Singapore Telecommunications was down 10 cents to $3.10, its lowest level in
nearly three weeks.

The dismal trading story repeated itself across the causeway, as the benchmark
Kuala Lumpur Composite Index fell 1.68 points to 1,148.5. The Second Board
index fell 12.27 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 558.97.

"The 12-point drop on the Second Board may have caused quite a bit of jitters
on the Malaysian side," said a remisier.

But over-the-counter stocks dominated volumes and gainers here and the UOB-OTC
index closed up 2.89 points at 1,191.82.

MBf Holdings topped the turnover list, rising two cents to 62.5 cents on 3.44
million shares. Technology Resources Industries Bhd was the top gainer,
soaring 32 cents to $4.02.

Volume was 77.6 million shares worth $229.2 million compared to 92.04 million
units worth $216.48 million last Friday. Losers swamped gainers 221 to 93,
with 249 stocks unchanged. -TAN LI ENG.

August manufacturing output dwindles 7.6%

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

SINGAPORE'S manufacturing output shrank 7.6 per cent in August, with the
critical electronics industry recording a 5.1 per cent fall in output from a
year ago.

"The output of chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, petrochemical and
specialty chemicals), transport equipment, plastic products and petroleum
industries also declined," the Economic Development Board (EDB) said
yesterday.

Only industrial chemicals and gases and electrical machinery did not suffer
falls in output during the month, according to the EDB's industrial production
index. The sectors grew 2.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively.

Cumulative manufacturing output for the first eight months of this year grew
6.4 per cent year-on-year, the board said, with cumulative electronics output
growth of 12.6 per cent.

The poorest performers were the paints and pharmaceuticals and transport
equipment sectors, whose output fell 24.6 per cent and 18.5 per cent
respectively.

Output of plastic products and fabricated metal products slowed in line with
the decline in the electronics industry, falling 15.5 per cent and 7.2 per
cent respectively.

The petroleum industry's output fell 9.2 per cent "due to lower output by a
major refinery which experienced technical start-up problems after its
shutdown for maintenance in July".

The printing and publishing industry declined 3.7 per cent because of reduced
orders from the commercial print media.

The poor manufacturing output figures had been anticipated after August's
worse-than-expected 6.3 per cent fall in non-oil domestic exports.

Commenting on those numbers two weeks ago, Trade and Industry Minister Yeo
Cheow Tong said the Singapore economy was "on track" to achieve the 7 to 8 per
cent economic growth forecast for this year.

He added that, based on feedback from industry, the Government expected to see
some recovery in the electronics sector in the first six months of next year.

Slower property investment sales in third quarter

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kalpana Rashiwala

But sales so far this year hit record $9b

PROPERTY investment sales in the third quarter slowed 17 per cent from the
preceding three months, due mainly to slower sales of land for residential
development, particularly in the private sector.

Nonetheless, investment sales for the first nine months of this year reached
$9.3 billion -exceeding the record $7.7 billion chalked up for the whole of
last year, according to Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) figures.

Investment sales of property refer to purchases of development sites and en
bloc sales, not single units bought by consumers. They are used as a gauge of
developers' confidence in the mediumto long-term prospects of the property
market.

Total investment sales fell in the July-September period to $2.5 billion -from
$2.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.9 billion in the first quarter.

The third quarter saw lower proceeds from sales of residential development
sites -by both the state and private sector. The combined figure for the third
quarter was $1.2 billion, down 30 per cent from $1.7 billion in the second
quarter and a heftier 43 per cent from $2.1 billion during January to March
this year.

Government sales of housing plots in the third quarter totalled $731 million
-compared with $837 million and $1.6 billion in the second and first quarters
respectively.

Sales of private development sites -which include en bloc or collective sales
of apartments with redevelopment potential -came off even more dramatically in
the third quarter, falling 46 per cent to $470 million from the second
quarter's $881 million. However, the figure was not far off the $488 million
in the first quarter.

"Sales of residential development sites still contributed 49 per cent to
overall investment sales for the quarter," noted JLW executive director Steven
Choo.

However, this was lower than 54.7 per cent and 58.3 per cent for the first and
second quarters respectively.

Analysts had expected the drop in investment sales of residential plots,
particularly in the private sector.

Said UBS Securities senior research analyst Soon Ching Voon: "Since the
mid-May property curbs were introduced, there had been many land tenders,
mostly en bloc sales, for which results have not been announced, including
properties in the Dunearn and Upper Thomson areas.

"It probably means that the owners found the bids below their reserve prices,
or perhaps for some of the sites, no bids may have been received.

"Developers have become cautious." Analysts said the drop in sales of
government residential sites had more to do with the timing of the sales.

They noted that on the whole, the Government had been committed to increasing
residential land supply.

"However, tender prices have come off about 10-15 per cent since the property
curbs," noted Mr Soon.

There was a pick-up in sales of en bloc commercial properties in the third
quarter.

The Promenade along Orchard Road and Cockpit Hotel together with an adjoining
site changed hands last month for nearly $271 million and $380 million
respectively.

Dr Choo noted that several freehold bungalow and condominium sites, such as
City Mansions at Paterson Road, had been put on the market.

"Paradoxically, the current softer sentiment may help to make deals as both
buyers and sellers are more realistic about their expectations," he said.

GE Life sales agents protest against plan to cut commission / Great Eastern
Life

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

THE guild representing Great Eastern Life's sales representatives yesterday
spoke out against proposed cuts in their commissions.

Mr Mohd Amin, president of the GE Life Sales Representatives' Guild, told a
press conference: "It is a short-sighted policy to cut where it is easiest to
cut. It's killing the goose that lays the golden egg."

GE Life decided last month to reduce commissions for its 4,700 agents by an
average of 20 per cent from Jan 1 due to declining investment income.

Set against a competitive marketplace and low interest rates, the options open
to the management were cutting costs and raising returns on investments.

GE Life said in a rebuttal yesterday that the commission changes were
implemented so that its product cost structure will be in line with that of
the industry.

"Given the long-term nature of the life insurance investment, the company
needs to take prudent measures to safeguard the long-term interests of
policy-holders," it said.

The company also needs to ensure that its investment yield will be consistent
with the industry's long-term performance. It is hiring a chief investment
officer to oversee its investments.

Mr Amin said it was no fault of the agents that investment yields had been
below the industry average. Yet, the agents had to bear the brunt of reduced
remuneration. "We hope they will rethink the firm's overall strategy and not
treat us as scapegoats," he added.

Guild member Mervyn Goh pointed out that the company had been able to sustain
commissions for the past five years, when returns on investments were 4-6 per
cent.

He asked why, if GE Life could project a 7 per cent rate of return, it could
not maintain the established commission rates.

The guild claims that the company's proposed changes involved cuts in agents'
remuneration of between 15 and as much as 60 per cent on certain pay packages
-more than the average 15 to 25 per cent range mentioned by the company.

Changes in the agency structure hinder career advancement, it claimed. "Agents
may be demoted, become part-time agents, leave the company or industry
altogether," it warned.

However, the guild had encouraged its 3,565 agents and managers to stay on
with GE Life while it resolves matters with the management.

Guild representatives said they hoped press publicity will help clarify
matters and restore confidence in the company and that the management will
respond by withdrawing the proposed package.

They said their request to discuss the matter with GE Life's newly appointed
chief executive officer Tan Beng Lee had fallen on deaf ears, but GE Life said
there has been open dialogue.

Mr Justin Lee, honorary secretary of the guild, said the company's suggestion
-that agents change their strategy to promote more life policies to cushion
potential losses in earnings -was "improper and uncalled for".

The guild has, therefore, written to the Insurance Commissioner about their
concerns that this suggestion runs contrary to the code of conduct set out in
their agency agreement.

Delifrance issuing 45.16m shares at 78<c> apiece in IPO / Delifrance Asia,
SES, Stock Exchange of Singapore

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Freddie Ng

HOT on the heels of recent initial public offerings, French delicatessen chain
Delifrance Asia yesterday launched its IPO of 45.16 million shares at 78 cents
each for a mainboard listing.

At 78 cents, the offer shares of par value 10 cents each are being issued at a
historical price-earnings (PE) ratio of 17.26 times.

The public offer consists of 29.9 million new shares and 15.26 million vendor
shares, which are stock sold by the company's existing shareholders.
Delifrance will not have a placement tranche.

The public offer, representing 25 per cent of the company's enlarged share
capital, will yield net proceeds of about $21.7 million. Up to 10 per cent of
the offered shares will be reserved for the group's management, staff and
business associates.

According to Delifrance, $10 million of the net proceeds will be used to
upgrade and establish production facilities in Singapore, Philippines,
Australia, Malaysia, Hongkong and China.

Expansion of retail outlets in Singapore, Hongkong, Malaysia and Australia
will take up another $8 million and $3.7 million will be used as working
capital.

Analysts polled by The Straits Times generally agreed that Delifrance's main
strength was its highly visible trade name, which bodes well for its IPO.

They were, however, split on whether the relatively steep PE ratio of 17.26
times was too high.

One analyst from a local research house said the ratio was not high compared
to other food counters like Cerebos, Fraser & Neave and QAF Ltd which were all
currently trading at more than 30 times.

Two other analysts, however, said they had expected the ratio to be closer to
15 times.

Analysts also cited as a potential downside Delifrance's exposure to price
fluctuations of wheat flour and butter, the basic ingredients of its bakery
products.

Delifrance Asia has grown considerably over the past five years. The group
reported net profits of $6.8 million on sales of $98.5 million for the year
ended June. In 1992, it recorded $1.6 million net profit on sales of $37.1
million.

Delifrance, a subsidiary of French flour miller J-L Vilgrain Group, set up
shop here in 1983. It has cafes and takeaway outlets in Asia, which make and
sell French bakery products.

This, said one analyst, was good for the group because it would enjoy lower
business costs resulting from the vertical upstream activities.

The IPO, which is lead managed and underwritten by OCBC Bank, closes on Oct 17
and trading on a "when issued" basis starts on Oct 21.

STIC to begin work on Wuxi park"s third phase by next September / Singapore
Technologies Industrial Corporation, STIC

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Tammy Tan

SINGAPORE Technologies Industrial Corp (STIC) expects to embark on the third
phase of its Wuxi-Singapore Industrial Park (WSIP) project in China by
September next year.

The next stage of development was expected to add another 100 hectares of land
to the China project, STIC executive vice-president Goh Song How said in a
recent interview.

Phase one, covering 100 hectares, was completed in June and work on the 135 ha
second phase is underway and slated for completion by next year. Mr Goh said a
team of WSIP officials had started on the master plan for phase three of the
industrial park.

"As soon as the master planning is ready, our guys can go and start marketing
it. We have already completed the preliminary master plan and will probably
finish it by early next year," he said.

WSIP, which is lead managed by STIC, has incurred a total development cost of
US$120 million (S$169 million) to date. Other stakeholders in the development
include the Wuxi government, JTC International Ltd and KMP China Investments
Pte.

Yesterday, the developers announced that 11 new tenants had been signed on.
They will invest collectively an additional US$115 million, increasing total
funding by park tenants to US$430 million. Ten of the 11 tenants will take up
land plots ranging from one to eight hectares for their plants.

The park has a total of 36 committed tenants. Of these, 17 have begun
operations, including Seagate Technology, Siemens Components and Sumitomo
Electric.

They will employ a total of 6,000 workers by the end of the year and will
account for a total production value of almost US$200 million this year.

According to Mr Goh, occupancy rates for WSIP have been good. Phase one is
almost occupied fully while the second stage is nearly 40 per cent taken up.

He said there were no plans to embark on a fourth phase of development yet,
although the consortium had an option to develop up to 1,000 hectares of land.

"It's all a question of supply and demand. We have to stagger the development
plan to meet the demand," he said.

WSIP, which is one of three overseas industrial park projects STIC is
developing, incurred a small loss in the first half of this year. It is,
however, expected to generate profits by the end of the year.

TRI pays $63m for 15% stake in US satellite firm / Technology Resources
Industries, TRI, Orbcomm Global LP

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MALAYSIAN-LISTED Technology Resources Industries Bhd (TRI) has invested US$45
million (S$63.4 million) for a 15 per cent stake in US satellite
communications company Orbcomm Global L.P.

It has also been appointed Orbcomm's first service licensee in South-east
Asia, with rights to distribute Orbcomm services in Malaysia, Singapore and
Brunei itself or through resellers.

"Another US$7 million to US$8 million will be invested to build an Orbcomm
Gateway earth station and message processing centre in Malaysia, expected to
be completed in late 1997," TRI vice-president of new ventures Azhar Asmuni
told a news conference here.

The US$330 million Orbcomm system is the world's only operational low-earth
orbit (LEO) satellite system which enables subscribers to send and receive
short messages and identify their positions anywhere on earth at low cost,
said Orbcomm president Alan Parker.

Applications and services supported by the system include person-to-person
emergency communications, remote industrial asset and environmental
monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery, truck tracking and communications, and
two-way e-mail links through personal portable subscriber communicator units.

"Through the earth station in Malaysia, subscribers in Singapore, Malaysia and
Brunei will be able to obtain Orbcomm services in 1998," said Mr Azhar.

The Orbcomm system's two orbiting satellites serve about 350,000 subscribers
in the US with its limited communications capability, said Mr Parker.
"Real-time data communication will be available when 26 additional satellites
are launched and deployed next year."

He estimated the potential global market at 168 million subscribers, of which
one-third are in the Asia-Pacific. "For the most part, this market is unserved
or underserved by any other telecommunications technology."

Orbcomm Global L.P. is a partnership owned by Orbital Sciences Corporation in
the US, Teleglobe Inc of Canada and TRI.

Quokka subsidiary buys Southcorp"s Rheem division / Quokka Investments,
Rheem Concrete Industry Product, Cesco Australia

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Florence Chong in Sydney

A WHOLLY owned subsidiary of Australian-listed Quokka Investments -which is 47
per cent controlled by Singapore-based Zicom Pte Ltd -has acquired Rheem
Concrete Industry Product (Rheem CIP), a division of the diversified
industrial group, Southcorp Holdings Ltd.

Cesco Australia Ltd paid an undisclosed sum for the purchase of the business
in a deal finalised last Wednesday.

Rheem CIP's new owners planned to expand exports into new markets in Asia,
said the company's general manager (commercial), Mr Michael Mee.

Rheem CIP manufactures, markets and distributes transit concrete mixers under
the trade-name "Rheem-Vulcan" and "Vulcan".

More than two-thirds of its production of 900 units a year are exported
through Zicom Pte Ltd, mostly to Singapore, with some products also going to
Thailand, according to a statement by Zicom group managing director and Cesco
Australia managing director Sim Giok Lak.

"We plan to increase our exports into other Asian countries in the next two to
three years," he said.

Mr Mee said the company intended to export its concrete mixers to China early
next year. It would probably export to Malaysia and Indonesia later in the
year.

Rheem CIP plans to double production to 1,800 units a year in three years'
time. The export value of the output would be A$40 million (S$44 million). Its
current turnover is less than A$20 million a year.

Mr Sim also disclosed Zicom's plan to establish a joint venture in Malaysia
next year. The company has tie-ups in China, Thailand and Indonesia. "We plan
to assemble Vulcan transit concrete mixer in all these countries," he said.

Quokka, based in Perth, is a property and investment company with interests in
Australia and Singapore.

Its major shareholder is Zicom, which is also the company's single largest
overseas customer.

Scotts hearing told about new documents / Scotts Holdings, Scotts
Investments (Singapore) Pte Ltd

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

NEW documents have surfaced which might invalidate the transfer of listed
Scotts Holdings shares to the holding company of the controlling Jumabhoy
family, the High Court was told yesterday.

The documents show that the grandson of family patriarch Rajabali Jumabhoy was
a trustee of a settlement he had made in 1957, it was claimed at the start of
a six-week hearing of a suit filed by Mr Rajabali against three relatives and
the family holding company.

The 98-year-old Mr Rajabali is seeking to restore the benefits of his assets
to the entire family.

Mr Rajabali's lawyer Lim Chor Pee told the court that because Mr Asad
Jumabhoy, as trustee, had not executed the transfer form in respect of Scotts
Holdings shares transferred to the family company, Scotts Investments
(Singapore) Pte Ltd (SIS), the transfer was not valid.

Mr Lim said that, in fact, the trustees were not empowered to transfer Scotts
Holdings shares to SIS and their action constituted a breach of the 1957
settlement.

Earlier, lead counsel Mr Harry Wee, told Justice Judith Prakash that Mr
Rajabali was not claiming any money from the plaintiffs but that he was
seeking only to enforce the settlement made in 1957, whereby the benefits of
all his assets would go to all members of the family.

Mr Rajabali filed a suit a year ago along with his sons Yusuf and Mustafa,
daughter Perin, and grandchildren Anwar, Faez and Saleem.

The defendants are his eldest son, Mr Ameerali R. Jumabhoy, who resigned last
month as executive chairman of listed property and hospitality group Scotts
Holdings, grandsons Rafiq and Iqbal, former managing director and executive
director respectively of the company, and SIS, which owns 42.5 per cent of the
listed entity.

Mr Rajabali's main contention is that the family assets have been taken
control of by the Ameerali branch of the family.

In a day-long presentation, Mr Lim said that in 1957, Mr Rajabali made a
settlement of his property, No. 8 Scotts Road, in favour of his four children.

The object was to ensure that the property or its sale proceeds were not
distributed, but rather invested and the income accumulated for the benefit of
the beneficiaries.

The family formed Scotts Holdings Pte Ltd to develop their Scotts Road
property. The company was subsequently listed on the Stock Exchange of
Singapore.

But the Ameerali branch of the family went ahead to pledge Scotts Holdings
shares to banks to finance activities of other companies, contrary to the
intentions of Mr Rajabali, Mr Lim told the court.

At the start of the hearing yesterday, Mr Rajabali was in court along with
most of the other plaintiffs.

It has taken a battery of lawyers from Chor Pee & Company, representing the
plaintiffs; Drew & Napier, representing Ameerali and Iqbal; Allen & Gledhill,
representing Rafiq and Rajah & Tann, acting for SIS, a year to prepare for the
hearing.

Documents relating to the case run into 28 volumes.

The hearing continues today.

Issues, rather than insults, take centre stage in lively debate: "Clinton
parries Dole"s debate offensive", "Round One to Clinton-Careful, contained
and mainly cautious"and "Round One to Clinton-Critiques and the occasional
bit of wit"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lee Siew Hua in Cincinnati, Ohio

IT WAS a night of issues, not insults, as US President Bill Clinton and his
challenger, Mr Bob Dole, faced each other in a debate which was far livelier
than expected and could help tighten the race in the days before the election
next month.

The 90-minute debate brought the defining campaign issues of tax cuts and
stronger, safer families -elements of a gigantic spectrum of plans which will
affect Americans as they step gingerly into the next millennium -intimately
into the living rooms of an estimated 90 million people.

In reality, both candidates were not strikingly different on a number of
positions. Both proposed tax cuts, though in different forms and proportions.

Both emphasised education, with Mr Clinton citing his support for a
progressive array of school programmes and his rival arguing that authority
should now devolve from Washington to parents and schools. Mr Clinton, who has
shifted towards centrist politics during his presidency, has already been
tough on crime and has also sought to downsize government, both traditional
Republican concerns.

But rather than spend time on repeating those central messages, both men
sought to stress the subtle issue of trust.

Each tried to persuade voters that he could be entrusted with the major task
of building a bridge to the 21st century.

Mr Dole also sought to cast doubt on the President's trustworthiness, albeit
in a civil way and with touches of wit.

The challenger said that the President was scaring senior citizens by implying
that he would cut Medicare.

He also noted that Mr Clinton was prone to exaggerating his presidential
successes, accused the incumbent of being a closet liberal and summoned up
briefly the Whitewater spectre.

In many ways, Mr Dole relied on a highly negative strategy in the debate,
though softening this with anecdotes which attempted to show his compassion.

Mr Clinton, quick-thinking and a master of detail, sought to show that he was
a man of character who had kept his word on lifting the economy, reforming
welfare, fighting crime and other successes.

Overall, the debate was close but was more critical for Mr Dole as it had been
regarded widely as his last chance to win over undecided voters and shrink his
opponent's substantial lead, averaging 12-15 per cent since the campaign
began.

Mr Clinton shone. The challenger shone too -but partly because expectations of
him had sunk so low.

Mr Dole did manage to show during the face-off that he would make a plausible
president. But many will question if that is enough to unseat an incumbent
presiding over an economic success story in a non-war situation.

Polls suggest that most Americans have already made up their minds. Still,
swing voters will have another chance to make a side-by-side comparison during
the next debate -in San Diego on Oct 16 -which will use a cosier town-hall
format in which the incumbent excels.

Round One to Clinton -Critiques and the occasional bit of wit: "Issues,

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

How the two presidential candidates faced up to each other

US President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole drew sharp
distinctions in their appraisal of current world and national conditions on
Sunday night in the first televised debate of the 1996 campaign, outlining
different visions of the next four years.

Three polls conducted immediately after the 90-minute encounter, held in
Connecticut, showed that Mr Clinton won the debate. Here is a look at how they
performed.

HITS

* He maintained a steady critique of the President from beginning to end,
defining his challenger's posture crisply, snapping out critiques and easing
up to find the occasional bit of humour.

* His opening was more personal, designed to wipe away impressions of him as
negative or harsh, but did not lay out a vision of where he wanted to take the
country.

* He was forceful in criticising Mr Clinton's foreign policy and his record on
the economy.

* He demonstrated a mastery of the details of government that easily matched
Mr Clinton's.

* He scored several times with his humour, teasing the President about his
weight and his cholesterol and himself about his fall from a campaign platform
in California. He showed he is not just a grumpy old man, as some have said.

* Viewers also saw Mr Dole's wit -a trademark of his Senate career but rarely
seen on the 1996 campaign trail.

* He made an effort throughout the debate to portray himself as a caring,
compassionate person, whose war wounds and family poverty had made sensitive
to the needs of people with problems.

MISSES

* Democrats contended that Mr Dole's negative tone, which became more apparent
as the debate wore on, would come back to haunt him.

* He barely mentioned the economic boom that his supply-side running-mate,
Jack Kemp, contends would be set off by the Republicans' 15 per cent tax cut,
and he said little about revolutionary change in the federal tax code.

* He had trouble poking holes in Mr Clinton's economic record.

How the two presidential candidates faced up to each other

US President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole drew sharp
distinctions in their appraisal of current world and national conditions on
Sunday night in the first televised debate of the 1996 campaign, outlining
different visions of the next four years.

Three polls conducted immediately after the 90-minute encounter, held in
Connecticut, showed that Mr Clinton won the debate. Here is a look at how they
performed.

HITS

* His opening statement set the tone for much of the debate. He was upbeat and
future-oriented, claiming the nation had made progress under his leadership
and that he needed four more years to continue the job.

* He made his case calmly and with good humour, stating a credo that reflected
his rediscovered centrism of the last year or so: "I believe the purpose of
politics is to give people the tools to make the best of their own lives."

* So that he would appear more presidential, he avoided engaging his opponent
directly on most issues, preferring to state his own position without
referring directly to Mr Dole's charges.

* He kept his tongue when Mr Dole smilingly compared him to "the great
exaggerator", the senator's dead brother, Kenny. "Kenny was a great talker,
and he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate. So we had a
rule, we divided by six -in your case maybe just two."

* His style emphasised butterfly over bee, a smile over umbrage, as when he
grinned in meeting the expected assertion from Mr Dole that "liberal" is the
only accurate description of the President.

* His performance was much like his campaign has been: careful, contained and
generally cautious.

MISSES

* He had little that was fresh to offer, returning several times to the
metaphor he has ridden hard since the Democratic convention, the now-famous
"bridge to the 21st Century".

* "The President was on the defensive, and that was a strategic mistake, "
said Senator Connie Mack, Republican-Florida, one of Mr Dole's debate
advisers.

CPIB nabs two linked to Amcol"s Mauritius deal / Amcol Holdings, Sando &
Cie

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

TWO men were arrested by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB)
last week in connection with Amcol Holdings' aborted multimillion-dollar
project in Mauritius.

Both men have been released, each on bail of $500,000.

Meanwhile, Amcol, its Mauritian joint-venture partner Sando & Cie, and
Mauritian businessman Roland Maurel have entered recently into a fresh
agreement in which Mr Maurel agreed to buy out Amcol's 40 per cent stake in
the Mauritian venture.

Price Waterhouse had pointed out in its report that the company seemed to have
overpaid US$14 million (S$19.7 million) for its stake.

Over on the Indian Ocean island, the controversial project had caused a public
uproar. This led Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam to order a probe by
a high-powered fact-finding team, chaired by an influential retired Chief
Justice.

In August, Amcol's interim judicial managers had sued former Amcol executive
directors Lloyd Lochra and Ng Chee Kheong for "secret commissions and/or
bribes received in connection with Project Mauritius".

The suit was related to three separate payments of US$300,000 (about
S$423,000) by Sando & Cie, which were mentioned in a report on Amcol by Price
Waterhouse.

The interim judicial managers also obtained a court injunction to freeze the
assets worldwide of Mr Lochra, who is an American.

Easyknit falls short of issue price on market debut / Easyknit
International Holdings Ltd

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

MAINBOARD-LISTED garment exporter Easyknit International Holdings yesterday
became the second initial public offering (IPO) in the past week to close
below its issue price on its trading debut.

It ended its first day of trading at HK$2.90, 15 HK cents below its HK$3.05
issue price.

Easyknit's share price dipped to as low as HK$2.60 in intra-day trading, with
a total of 1.75 million shares changing hands.

Last Friday, another mainboard debutante, frozen seafood producer Pacific
Andes (Holdings), had closed 3.5 US cents below its offer price of 57 US cents
on its first trading day.

A dealer attributed the poor performance of the Hongkong-based garment maker
and exporter to the fact that "Singapore is simply not the choice market at
the moment".

Furthermore, said another dealer, the stock market was averse to foreign
currency-denominated listings, preferring instead to stick to Singapore-dollar
counters.

Besides closing below its issue price, the public tranche of Easyknit's IPO
was 70 per cent undersubscribed at its close last Monday.

However, all 25 million placement shares offered were taken up.

Easyknit's IPO fared worse than the only other undersubscribed offering this
year. Home decor distributor Roly International Holdings' IPO in February was
14 per cent undersubscribed.

A dealer said the subscription rate could be poor because Easyknit's offer
period was too short. The offering, which was launched on Sept 27, closed on
Oct 1.

Dow breaches 6,000 for first time in early trading: "Overseas funds pour
into Hongkong bourse" and "Bourse fails torally on back of Wall Street
gains"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

NEW York stocks surged in early trading yesterday, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average breaking the 6,000-point barrier for the first time.

It reached a high of 6,002.17 within the first hour.

Meanwhile, Asian bourses closed mixed yesterday, following a strong rally on
Wall Street last Friday as fears of higher interest rates subsided.

A surprisingly weak US September jobs report, released last Friday, quelled
concerns of rising interest rates, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average up
60.01 points to a record close of 5,992.86.

The Hongkong stock market was one of the main beneficiaries of the Wall Street
gains.

The Hang Seng Index surged yesterday to record its biggest point gain since
March as new records on Wall Street and strong interest in China counters
spurred active buying.

The market barometer jumped 227.56 points to 12,133.07. It now lies just 68
points short of its record close of 12,201.09, which was reached on Jan 4,
1994.

Australian stocks also climbed, led by media group News Corp and banks, thanks
to Australian bond yields falling to 2-1/2-year lows and the rally in US
stocks.

The benchmark All-Ordinaries Index rose 24.3 points to 2,339.8, a shade below
its all-time closing high of 2,340.6 in February 1994.

Markets elsewhere in Asia, however, fell despite the sharp gains in New York.

In Singapore, poor sentiment coupled with sustained underweighting activity
led the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index to fall 22.2 points to
2,126.66.

Across the Causeway, the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index shed 1.68
points to 1148.50, while the Second Board index fell 12.27 points, or 2.1 per
cent, to 558.97.

Indonesian stocks also declined, dragged lower by a 6 per cent drop in
cigarette maker PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna on concerns about its US$400
million (S$564 million) borrowings.

The benchmark Jakarta Stock Composite Index slipped 2.03 points to 586.31.

Likewise in Manila, Philippine stocks sank as some foreign funds off-loaded
property counters on concern that the market was becoming saturated.

The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 10.11 points to
3,121.03.

Thai stocks were battered, plunging a sharp 6 per cent at the close of
trading.

Big banks led the decline amid concern that annual economic growth of 8 per
cent was a thing of the past, analysts said.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index finished down 60.26 points at 944.63.
This was its lowest level since August 1993.

Property buyers becoming highly price-sensitive : Analysts

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Kalpana Rashiwala

Government curbs "effective in pushing speculators out of market'

PROPERTIES launched in recent weeks appear to have enjoyed reasonable success,
particularly those priced competitively, say analysts.

One of the most successful developments is Wing Tai's Sunrise Gardens off Yio
Chu Kang Road. The 99-year project, with 252 condominium units, is about 65
per cent sold three weeks after its launch in mid-September.

Analysts credited its success primarily to its attractive average net price of
$580 psf. Some market watchers had feared earlier that the project's 99-year
leasehold status and its location in an outlying area might impede sales.

One market watcher noted that in contrast, Villa Azura was less than half sold
although it was a freehold property in the prime Bukit Timah belt. Villa
Azura's net average price is $1,150 psf.

"Buyers have become extremely price-sensitive," said UBS Securities senior
research analyst Soon Ching Voon. "In the past, people were more willing to
pay whatever price was asked as long as the project was freehold and had a
good location. This is no longer true."

He said the May 15 property curbs had removed speculators from the market.
"These people did not care about pricing. As long as the location was good and
the project was freehold, they knew there would be buyers, so they could churn
the property. Now the market is left with genuine buyers who know what they
can afford to pay every month."

Other recent launches which have fared well include Pidemco's Hillbrooks
condominium, launched a week ago.

Eighty-four of the 120 units in the 299-unit project offered in the first
phase have been sold. The units are priced at $700 psf -lower than the
$730-750 psf for two earlier projects nearby, The Amston and Merawoods.

Ballota Park is also doing well, with 161 units of the 215 units launched
taken up already. Far East Organization's Sherwood, selling at $800 psf, is
about 75 per cent sold.

Edmund Tie and Co executive director Ong Choon Fah expects developers to
continue pricing their projects "realistically", in view of the "current
market sentiment".

About 1,600 private housing units have been launched since Sept 1, increasing
the total marketed so far this year to about 8,680 units, according to ET & Co
figures.

Mrs Ong said another 4,000 units may be launched before the year is out,
taking the fullyear figure to 12,680 -higher than about 10,000 units marketed
last year.

However, the level of actual supply would depend on a few factors, like
developers securing the necessary approvals to launch the projects, she said.

With most developers, particularly those with larger projects, seeking to sell
their properties in phases, there may be some overflow in the early part of
next year.

With showflats playing an increasingly important role in the marketing of
projects, developers may wait for their showflats to be completed before
launching their projects.

"And if by the time this is done, it is approaching the Christmas season with
many people away, developers may want to hold back the launch," she said.

Projects slated for launch include the 655-unit Guilin View at Bukit Batok,
the 384-unit Trellis Park at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and the final 110 units at
Ardmore Park.

On the pricing of upcoming launches, Mr Soon said: "Developers will still try
to maintain their original (pre-speculation curbs) asking prices or cut them
by about 10 per cent.

"So far we have not seen developers undercutting each other, although
Pidemco's $700 psf pricing for Hillbrooks raised concern among some
competitors.

"This is clearly a buyer's market. Buyers can afford to do their sums, to see
which projects they can afford ... and with more supply coming on, that's good
news for home buyers."

Doing the sums on Tampines Finance Park  - Will banks be sold on relocating
their operations?

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lynn Seah

The buildings are coming up fast at Singapore's first finance park in
Tampines. The biggest leaseholder, Singapore Land, will have its Tampines
Junction office ready next March, but so far, there have been no takers. LYNN
SEAH checks out the prospects for the finance park, on Page Two.

DOING THE SUMS ON TAMPINES FINANCE PARK

IT IS lunch hour. Briefcase-toting executive types cram the eating places. It
looks like Raffles Place, but wait, why are there so many grandmothers with
toddlers in tow, and children in school uniforms?

But then this is a vision not of Raffles Place, but of Tampines in the future,
when its Finance Park is fully developed.

The park, which was mooted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the
Economic Development Board, is to be a key financial centre outside the
Central Business District. The Government wants to encourage banks and
finance-related businesses to re-locate backroom operations there.

Six parcels of land totalling 1.94 ha in Tampines Regional Centre have been
tendered out by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in 1994 and last year
for the development of the park. One condition was that developers must house
finance-related operations on at least 70 per cent of the floor space.

Singapore Land's Tampines Junction will be one of the first developments to be
completed next March. The company is negotiating with some financial
institutions, but no tenants have been confirmed yet for the nine-storey
building.

Besides SingLand, which clinched three of the six plots through wholly-owned
Shenton Holdings, the other successful bidders were Tat Lee Bank, Overseas
Union Bank and NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative.

They will not be the first to bring financial institutions into Tampines,
however.

DBS Bank moved some operations to Tampines as far back as 1993. Its
autobanking centre, data centre, as well as administration, audit, human
resource and training functions are now housed in DBS Tampines Centre, an
office and shopping complex.

Standard Chartered has also moved some of its operations, now housed in the
CPF Tampines building.

However, Tampines Junction and the other SingLand developments are unique in
that they will not be owner-occupied. The developers of the other plots are
all finance-related businesses.

To fill the approximately 15,000 sq m of net floor space in Tampines Junction,
SingLand is targeting multinational financial institutions which are heavy
users of space, but do not need much face-to-face interaction with customers.

"We are looking especially at those involved in international and regional
trade financing because most of the transactions are done through computers,"
said Mr Anthony Sim, SingLand's general manager for marketing.

To the smaller users of space who will reap less in terms of rental savings,
SingLand is trying to sell another idea -that of the benefits of having a full
back-up service in a different place.

"There is a trend now for banks to have a back-up office somewhere else, just
in case the computer in the main branch fails to deliver," he said.

So Tampines Junction offers features such as a back-up generator with enough
capacity to power the air-conditioning and computers in the building if there
is a power failure.

In its marketing efforts, SingLand is trying to encourage its potential
tenants to take a long view when deciding whether to re-locate.

"The selling point is actually mid-term savings. For multinatinal banks, who
occupy a number of floors, the saving over five to 10 years is substantial,"
said Mr Sim.

Monetary savings aside, companies have other concerns about moving, in
particular staff resistance.

LAST year, a survey by property consultant Knight Frank and a former National
University of Singapore academic showed that only 3.8 per cent of 158
respondents located in the CBD said they would move out in the immediate
future. Respondents included financial institutions. Of those considering
decentralising, about 60 per cent said they preferred fringe areas such as
Marina Bay.

Concerns about decentralisation centred on the fear of damage to business
contacts due to "inappropriate location" and loss of the prestige attached to
central addresses.

Apart from Tampines Junction, Singland has two eight-storey office buildings,
Tampines Plaza I & II, to be completed in 1998.

Tat Lee Bank's eight-storey TLB Tampines Centre will be completed in mid-1997,
but will be fully owner-occupied. Tat Lee will house backroom operations,
recreational facilites for staff and a banking branch.

NTUC Income plans to use 30 per cent of the space in its nine-storey Tampines
Point for its own operations.

The other leaseholder, OUB, declined to reveal its plans.

Whether or not more sites in Tampines Regional Centre will be offered for
finance-park development has not been decided, says the HDB.

Keppel Bank is actively exploring the possibility of moving to the suburbs,
but the cost has to be right, says a spokesman.

The success of Tampines Finance Park will hinge on rents being attractive
enough. "Rental differentials have to be substantial to make it worthwhile for
a company to locate there," said Ms Angela Tan, executive director with
property consultant Edmund Tie & Company.

Top office rents in the CBD are $9 to $10 per sq ft. Suburban rents are $4 to
$6. SingLand's asking rental is about $6.

SingLand explains that its rentals are high for suburban properties because
the offices are as good as those in the CBD. The cost of Tampines Junction,
including land cost, is more than $100 million.

There is market talk that the developer may think of selling instead of
renting but Life! could not get a comment from SingLand by press time. One
property consultant felt the asking rent was unrealistic. "This is a new
market. You cannot ask what you want. You have to sell the idea," he said.

Consultants also point out that there are ample alternative locations for
financial institutions if rentals in Tampines are unattractive.

There is the fringe, the Marina Bay area where rents of $6.50 to $7.50 per sq
ft compare favourably with those of the suburbs. The upcoming developments in
River Valley -Great World City, UE Square, Valley Point -will also be
competing with Tampines for tenants.

Property consultants generally feel that for the Finance Park to take off, the
gap between the rents there and those in the fringe locations will have to be
widened.

"Perhaps the Government can offer some kind of incentive, like rental
subsidies, to help the landlords attract tenants," said Ms Lynette Leong,
associate director at Jones Lang Wootton.

BUT there is no question that the concept of a finance park is a good one
which banks can benefit from.

Mr Christopher Fossick, Richard Ellis' executive director for commercial
leasing, said: "I think what is going to happen is that a few significant
leases will be concluded, a critical mass will start forming and the idea of
going to Tampines will become more acceptable to banks and their employees."

The pool of potential tenants for the park is also growing as more and more
foreign banks are using Singapore as a base, he adds.

Besides, Tampines has a lot going for it -good transport and a good range of
eating, shopping, entertainment and other service outlets. These count towards
making re-location less painful for staff.

Tampines is being built up as Singapore's eastern hub with facilities such as
offices and shopping complexes which will offer a range of jobs. There are
plans to boost the commercial space at Tampines Regional Centre around the
Tampines MRT Station, now amounting to about 243,000 sq m, by another 79,000
sq m. Some 176,800 people live in Tampines now.

When DBS Bank made its move three years ago, the matter of some staff having
to travel further from home to office was anticipated. It was resolved by
tranferring those who did not mind working in Tampines to the new offices and
redeploying the rest elsewhere. People living around Tampines were also
recruited for the new offices.

Has the move been worthwhile? "The savings in rental far exceeds any
additional expenses," said a spokesman.

Will enough financial institutions feel the same way? There will be quite a
bit of space coming up in the park.

Two men, their friendship and passion for science: Computer science and
biology make good bedfellows

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Lea Wee

Childhood buddies Tan Tin Wee and S. Subbiah learnt the importance of science
in school and have now joined forces to run the new Bioinformatics Centre here

TWO old friends are charting new courses in the use of computer science in
biological research and the development of drugs here.

Dr Tan Tin Wee and Dr S. Subbiah -classmates since Primary 2 -played key roles
in setting up the Bioinformatics Centre at the National University of
Singapore, one of the few such centres in the world.

The two are naturally excited about their project, which held its inaugural
symposium last week.

The centre plans to help biologists and drug companies analyse and manage the
huge amount of genetic data which has been churned out at a fantastic rate in
recent years.

Its development grew out of a friendship bound in great part by a deep passion
for science.

Says Dr Tan, 34, the centre's acting director: "One of the things we learnt in
school is the importance of being creative in science, and not to be afraid to
try out new things."

Try out new things they certainly did.

In a science project at Anglo-Chinese Junior College, they joined forces with
two other students to show that human hair can be turned into food products.

Chuckling, Dr Subbiah, 35, the centre's director for research, recalls: "We
went to barber shops, told them we were doing some science project and grabbed
the hair off the floor."

The collected hair was then boiled and stewed for two days in "various nasty
chemicals".

Says Dr Subbiah: "We did not understand exactly how the whole thing worked.
All we knew was that we wanted to boil the strands of hair into its basic
building blocks, which are amino acids."

They showed that boiled hair can be used as plastic, glue, plant fertilisers
and animal feed.

The project, called The Possible Uses And Applications Of Human Hair Keratin,
won them first prize in the pre-university chemistry section for the Science
Fair Project in 1978.

They also produced a science documentary, which won the Best Production award
in the Innovators '79 TV series.

"We had a great time catching on camera how animals such as pigs, chickens and
sea urchins do it," recalls Dr Subbiah with a grin.

After junior college, the two friends went off down separate paths. Dr Tan
served his national service and later read natural sciences at Cambridge
University.

Dr Subbiah went to do mathematical physics in the Imperial College of London.

But they kept in touch and did not forget what they were taught in school.

Dr Subbiah, after deciding that the job opportunities for a degree in
mathematical physics were "not too great", went on to pursue a doctorate in
structural biology at Harvard University.

"But I hated it," he says, grimacing at the memory.

He decided to try something more theoretical and took a postdoctoral degree in
biocomputing at Stanford University.

It was the right decision. He went on to file a few patents and co-founded a
biotechnology software company in the United States.

Today, he does research at Wistar Institute at the University of Pennsylvania,
one of the foremost centres for bioinformatics.

Meanwhile, after getting his degree, Dr Tan went on a masters degree in
biotechnology at University College London and later a doctorate at Edinburgh
University.

As part of his doctorate, he produced a genetically-engineered animal vaccine,
which won the young researcher the United Kingdom's Vaccine Research Trust's
Annual Prize in 1989.

A year later, he returned to join the National University of Singapore's
biochemistry department as a lecturer. Outside his working hours, he continued
to pursue his interest in biocomputing with the help of the Computer Centre at
the NUS.

Dr Tan was also instrumental in introducing biocomputing as an elective for
biochemistry honours course in 1991.

His work in Internet biomedical databases won him the prestigious Gold Medal
awarded by the Council of the World Congress for Medical Informatics in 1992
and the Singapore Youth Award in 1994.

In 1994, he donned another hat, heading the Technet unit, the first local
Internet service for research and development and took it to privatisation in
1995.

This later became the Pacific Internet.

As early as 1991, Dr Tan and Dr Subbiah were already talking about introducing
bioinformatics in Singapore.

With the encouragement of the latter, Dr Tan proposed to incorporate
biocomputing as part of the Bioscience Centre. But this was dropped because of
budget constraints. Says Dr Tan: "At that time, we commiserated with each
other but continued to float the idea to various funding bodies."

One of these was the Economic Development Board.

Their persistence paid off. Last year, the EDB agreed to pump $6 million to
set up of a Bioinformatics Centre at the NUS.

Says Dr Subbiah: "It is really exciting to be working in such a field, the
opportunities are tremendous."

Both credit their success today to their teachers at Anglo-Chinese Secondary
and ACJC.

Says Dr Tan: "I remembered that before I left ACS, my principal wrote in my
testimonial that I would succeed in whatever I chose to do. His confidence in
students was shared by the teachers.

"This confidence has become a virtuous cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy."

Computer science and biology make good bedfellows: Two men, their
friendship and passion for science

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

IT MAY seem ironic that many of the staff at the newly-opened Bioinformatics
Centre at the National University of Singapore are not trained specifically in
bioinformatics.

Instead, they are either biologists who have picked up computer science or
computer scientists who have learnt biology.

For bioinformatics, which marries biology with computer science, is still a
relatively new discipline, explains the centre's acting director, Dr Tan Tin
Wee.

But it is beginning to be recognised slowly as a discipline in universities
around the world. In Singapore, it was introduced as an elective for
biochemistry honours students at the National University of Singapore in 1991.

Says Dr Tan: "There is an increasing demand for people who are adept at both
computer science and biology."

This is largely because of the explosive growth of genetic data generated by
the Human Genome Project which began in 1991.

The ultimate aim of this global collaboration is to identify and analyse all
the three billion "letters" in a person's genetic make-up -known collectively
as the human genome -by the year 2002.

Biomedical researchers hope the analysed data can identify new genes which may
help in curing genetic diseases. Meanwhile, drug companies hope this
information can help them discover and develop new drugs.

But the biological information is being generated at a far faster rate than it
can be analysed.

Dr Tan points out, for instance, that the process of identifying DNA
sequencing has reached an industrial scale today -about 10 million DNA
sequences are being churned out each week.

Flooded with this huge amount of genetic data, biologists and drug companies
alike are clamouring for people trained in both biology and computer science
to help them retrieve and analyse the data.

The resource unit at the Bioinformatics Centre, located at the NUS Computer
Centre, hopes to create a manpower pool to provide training. It also hopes to
provide facilities to assist biologists with their computational needs and
provide access to databases.

Equally important is the need to carry out more basic research and
development, says Dr Tan.

The centre has a research unit located at the Institute of Systems Science.

Its flagship project, spearheaded by the ISS and in collaboration with the
University of Pennsylvania, one of the foremost centres for bioinformatics, is
BioKleisli.

This is a sophisticated system which pulls relevant information from various
databases, integrates, crunches and analyses them, before giving them back to
the user

Heading the project team is its inventor, Dr Wong Lim Soon, from the ISS, a
Lee Kuan Yew Fellowship holder.

Says Dr Tan: "At present, the other available tools are not so sophisticated
and fast. They can pull information only from specific databases."

To maintain the integrity of the information, the system will build another
layer to help resolve any conflicts found within it.

Right now, the centre is negotiating with at least two pharmaceutical giants
to test the system on their network and to collaborate on projects. It is also
conducting the virtual cell project. It represents biological knowledge in a
virtual reality manner.

Says Dr Tan: "At the click of a button, a person can navigate through a cell
and access information on the part of the cell he is interested in. He can
also get related information and communicate with people who are doing
research in this particular part of the cell."

This project will eventually merge with the BioKleisli Project.

Two art auctions rake in $10 m and record prices

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Claudette Peralta

ART lovers and investors apparently worked up quite a thirst pouring money
into paintings from South-east Asia over the weekend.

One bidder also uncorked $38,500 from his bank account for a lot of wines.

The world's two major auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's, raked in
combined sales of nearly $10 million. More than 800 people attended the
events.

By far the biggest chunk of money went for a piece by the German painter who
lived and worked in Bali, Walter Spies. His View Across the Sawahs To Gunung
Agung alone fetched $1,048,750.

That was more than twice the original estimate of between $500,000 and
$700,000. It was sold on Sunday at the Christie's auction at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel which grossed a total of about $5.5 million in sales.

Other paintings fetched prices three to six times higher than their estimates.

These included A Pasar by Singaporean artist Lee Man Fong which went for
$146,750 against the original estimate of $25,000 to $35,000.

Filipino artist Fernando Cueto Amorsolo's In the Shade Of A Mango Tree sold
for $119,250, well above the original estimate of $20,000 to $30,000.

Kampong Tafereeltje by the Dutch painter Gerard Pieter Adolfs was estimated to
be worth $6,000 to $8,000 but sold for $19,550.

Sotheby's debut sale in Singapore grossed a total of S$3,803,350. It sold
almost 80 per cent of the lots offered.

A painting by A.J. Le Mayeur, Three Women Weaving in the Garden, fetched
$333,750 against the original estimate of between $120,000 and $150,000.

The Sotheby's auction, held at the Raffles Hotel Ballroom on Saturday, also
saw a few world auction record prices for works by some artists. One of them
was Hendra Gunawan, whose Women At A Waterfall was sold for $245,750.

Other records were chalked up by Emil Rizek and Widayat. Rizek's Cockfight In
Bali was sold for $141,250, while the latter's Manula Jogging Dikejar Anjing
went for $93,950.

The lots which did not meet the organiser's expectations was a work by
Singaporean artist Liu Kang titled Offerings and the work of Filipino artist
Juan Luna. These were not sold.

The sales included takings from the auction of South-east Asian paintings,
Straits Chinese works of art and the auction of fine and rare wines.

One happy bidder walked off with a Chateau Le Pin superlot of wines selected
from the 1985, 1986 and 1988 to 1994 vintages. These were sold collectively
for $38,500.

Another highlight was the sale of a very rare famille rose coral-red-ground
"in and out" Kamcheng and cover, originally priced at $18,000 to $25,000,
which sold for $27,600.

Mr Quek Chin Yeow, director of Sotheby's, Asia, noted that Singaporean,
Filipino and Vietnamese artists generally performed well.

But Indonesian art, both by native and foreign artists, were the star
performers and paintings with Balinese themes or subject matter found wide
appeal among buyers.

Ovarian cancer girl may miss umrah

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Tuminah Sapawi

OVARIAN cancer patient Nur Atiiqah Johari, who is due to perform the umrah
(minor pilgrimage) this month, may have to forgo the trip because of her
deteriorating condition.

The nine-year-old girl's doctor, Dr Allen Yeoh, a child cancer specialist at
the National University Hospital (NUH), told Life! that her condition is not
stable and she is unfit to travel.

"She is in great pain and right now, what is good for her is rest -she needs
all the rest she can get," said Dr Yeoh, who declined to reveal more about her
condition.

Nur Atiiqah was hospitalised about two weeks ago at NUH and is still being
treated there.

On learning of her condition, Syakira Travel & Tours, which is sponsoring her
trip, has decided to offer a cash donation of $4,600 instead. This is the cost
of a 12-day umrah package for two adults and one child.

Late last month, the travel agent had agreed to sponsor Nur Atiiqah's parents
for the trip as well.

Said Syakira's managing director Ismail Angullia: "There were two things which
we considered when we heard of her present condition. We could either postpone
the trip until she gets better or we could give her cash instead.

"We chose the latter because we think the family needs all the financial
assistance they could get."

Nur Atiiqah's parents, Mr Johari Simum, 48, and Madam Sariah Samuh, 40, were
too distraught to speak to the press.

Mr Johari is a Malaysian who works there, and he visits the family from time
to time. Madam Sariah is a production operator.

Nur Atiiqah is the third of their five children. The others are Siti Sholeha,
14, Mohamed Hasbullah, 10, Ibrahim Abdul Karim, six, and Mohamed Adam, four.

The girl, who was diagnosed with cancer in March this year, has had both her
ovaries removed and undergone chemotherapy.

Ovarian cancer is more common among older women although the chances of a
young girl getting it are one in 100,000 a year.

Nur Atiiqah stopped attending school when she began chemotherapy treatment in
the middle of this year. Her weight has also dropped from 35 kg to 25 kg.

In an earlier interview with the Malay-language daily Berita Harian, Madam
Sariah said her daughter can walk but is very weak.

Day when two Japanese bombs fell

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Wong Chee Meng

SPEAK MANDARIN CAMPAIGN 

THE reason Mr Teong Ah Chin remains a member of the Singapore Civil Defence
Force even at the age of 80 lies in his personal experiences during the
Japanese Occupation of Singapore.

The sprightly restaurant helper was then a patriotic young man selling flowers
in the streets to raise funds for China's anti-Japanese resistance forces.

One day, he was in the vicinity of the now-defunct New World at Jalan Besar
when a Japanese bomber swooped past him suddenly and dropped two bombs as he
ran for cover.

"One of them landed where Sim Lim Tower stands today, and the other at Jalan
Pisang where the coffeeshop belonging to my brother's father-in-law was," he
recalled.

"When I reached there, the coffeeshop was already reduced to rubble. I had to
remove the debris to rescue my brother."

Mr Teong recounted this experience at a Mandarin storytelling competition,
titled An Experience In Emergency, last Sunday.

The contest, organised by the Civil Defence Association for NS (CDANS), Lianhe
Wanbao, Shin Min Daily News and 95.8 FM as part of the current Speak Mandarin
Campaign, was held at the CDANS Town Clubhouse in Marina Square.

It attracted 35 participants, ranging in age from 15 to 80. About four of them
related historical happenings, including the times when floods and racial
riots gripped Singapore, while others told of personal tragedies resulting
from traffic accidents or factory mishaps.

Businessman Tan Jack Kwang, 37, remembered one weekend in 1978 when torrential
rains caused one of the worst floods on the island.

"The roads in Punggol and Potong Pasir disappeared under a sea of water.
Chickens, ducks, cows, dogs and even crocodiles were seen floating
everywhere."

He was then a national servicemen and, together with his colleagues, they took
out boats to rescue the stranded residents.

Painting sub-contractor Ho Kim Sian, 49, remembered the racial riots in 1964.

For hours, he could not leave his workplace because of the curfew.

Finally, on his way home, he saw a Chinese couple pleading in vain with
rioters not to burn their motorcycle.

"During the racial riots, tension ran high. I could feel every minute and
second ticking away," he said. "It just doesn't make sense for people to use
violence on each other."

Equally instructive were the personal tales.

System analyst Au Yong Keok, 35, shared a tragic incident close to her heart.

"My cousin's 30th death anniversary was just a few days ago, and I still
cannot forgive myself for having caused his death.

"I was five or six then and my cousin was nine years older. He had made me a
kite, and we were flying it when the string snapped and the kite flew to the
road. I bawled so loudly that he was forced to retrieve it for me.

"The next thing I knew, he was hit by a car. When I ran to the road, I saw a
pool of blood. The next day, I heard he had died. I cried."

Like Mr Ho, Mr Tan and most other participants, Ms Au Yong was
Chinese-educated and had taken part in several storytelling contests.

Mr Teong, too, was not a newcomer to such competitions, but he did not have a
formal Chinese education and learnt to speak Mandarin when he was in his 20s.

"I am a Fuzhou and I learnt Mandarin in a night school when I was 23," he
said. "I decided to pick up the language because it was fashionable to
converse in Mandarin then. Besides, we had to sing in Mandarin as part of our
fund-raising activities."

Generally, the contestants spoke in simple Mandarin, peppering their delivery
with an idiom every now and then.

Twelve were chosen for the finals to be held at the World Trade Centre Expo
Gateway on Oct 20.

The top three winners will take home $500, $400 and $300 respectively. The
fourth and fifth winners will receive $200 each and the rest $100 each. In
addition, all finalists will receive a trophy.

Sheer joy with Bartok showpiece

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Terence Dawson

Music

SINGAPORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Victoria Concert Hall Friday

THERE are three ways of responding to adversity: one can succumb to it, one
can defy it, or one can seize it as an opportunity to discover new things
about oneself.

Shaken by ill-health and the outbreak of World War II, Bartok had emigrated to
the United States. He was suffering from deep depression when the conductor
Koussevitsky commissioned him to write a work for the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.

The result was the Concerto For Orchestra, possibly the most accessible of his
works because it gives such important parts to every section of the orchestra.

It is often admired as a showpiece, but it is much more, representing one of
the most impressive responses to adversity ever written: the transformation of
personality not into self-indulgent expressionism, but joyful affirmation.

On Friday, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra under Choo Hoey gave it a
memorable reading. Having performed it on the European tour in 1988, and again
in 1991, it is a work it knows well. But since then, the orchestra has greatly
improved.

From the first shimmering of the violins against the steady cellos, every
section rose to its respective challenge, with the strings milking the music
for all its Hungarian resonance and the glowing brass in particularly fine
form.

The whimsical East-European cartoon-humour of the second movement was
complemented by a moving account of the scrupulously understated Elegy. The
ebullient humour of the Intermezzo was followed by a thrilling performance of
the alternately tender and joyful Finale.

The performance of Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, for which Choo Hoey opted
for a medium-sized orchestra, was equally impressive. The soloist was Kun Woo
Paik, a Korean now living in Paris. He is one of those relatively rare
pianists prepared to take risks, to experiment with possibilities rather than
reproduce what the audience have come to hear.

From the electrifying energy of his first entry to his gnomic cadenza, he kept
one transfixed. Instead of the usual hymn-like melody of the Adagio, he
emphasised the pathos of its insecure yearning: unstable and tender, but not
cloying. The last dying strain before the final chords was pure magic.

The evening also included the Overture to Schumann's rarely-performed opera
Genoveva. The SSO gave a splendid account of the tumultuous passions of the
three characters on which it was based, with the work building up to a
magnificent climax.

Souls in containers teem with secret lives

DORRIT YACOBY: VESSELS OF THE SOUL By Dorrit Yacoby At Notices The Gallery
Till Oct 26

ONE is introduced to art that lies on the edge between conscious sanity and
unconscious dreams in Dorrit Yacoby's works.

The 70-plus assemblages, which are the accumulated debris of her life, are
wrought with images of long-limbed women flying or raising their arms in
salute or despair, or in an embrace of the vessel.

Here, the vessel is one's heart, the container that may be filled with
purifying water for one's rebirth.

The theme of despair and rejuvenation is inherent in this series of works
which is, for the Israeli-Canadian, who has lived all her life in Israel, a
slow process that embodies her own rejuvenation.

"When I do the paintings, I heal myself," explains the 44-year-old whose works
were exhibited earlier this year in Beijing, Japan and Bangkok, and will
continue its tour from Singapore to India, Vietnam and Australia.

Each work lies in a roughly-made "container" itself. Within it, the works teem
with life through the heavily pock-marked and textured surfaces, created from
sawdust and objects such as shards of glass or porcelain, pomegranates, or
something as personal as her son's shoelace or a rope belonging to her
daughter.

The objects, culled into the space within the frame, carry within them a
secret life.

As artist Kandinsky once wrote: "Everything that is dead quivers. Not only the
things of poetry, stars, moon, wood, flowers, but even a white trouser button
glittering out of a puddle in the street ... Everything has a secret soul,
which is silent more often than it speaks."

The superimposed images of stars, ribbons, candles, vessels and women lend to
the coherence of that life; the works metamorphosise even as they hang there,
drowned in and besieged by the tar that Yacoby has poured into the container.

This struggle between the tar and the objects for "life" matches Yacoby's
constant discovery and confirmation of symbolic meanings.

Having studied Jewish mysticism, she has been surprised at how her
self-created tales parallel folk-myths. For instance, the flying woman she
depicts in The Flying Woman and Golden Tree With Flying Souls, is symbolic of
freedom. In mythology or folklore, a woman who had been fed with stones still
has the ability to "fly".

Overall, this exhibition is about the artist who, despite living in near
isolation, surrounded by the desert on three sides and a neighbourhood street
on the other, has the ability to "fly".

Yet the profundity of her work speaks not only of the individual but also of
the universal as it resonates within those of us who dare to look on when
someone peels back the layer that covers the soul.

Jackson"s concert aims to make HIStory here: "Tickets selling well" and
"Selangor bans concert by Michael Jackson"

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

By Rebecca Lim

With the logistics, nine shows can be put up in Singapore Indoor Stadium, says
production manager

THE Michael Jackson HIStory show, to be held at the National Stadium two weeks
from now, promises to make history here as the biggest pop concert ever.

It would be even bigger than the two staged by the self-proclaimed King of Pop
when he was here three years ago on his Dangerous tour, says Mr Peter Loh,
production manager for the HIStory concerts in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

Those previous concerts were, by far, the largest among pop concerts to have
been staged here, says Mr Loh, who also worked on them. But the current show
looks set to dwarf them.

"With the logistics for the HIStory concert, you can put up nine shows in the
Singapore Indoor Stadium," he adds. For example, five generators are being
shipped in to churn up 8,400 amperes of electricity needed to power the
one-night show.

"The last time, the power generated was comparable to what was needed to light
up Ang Mo Kio," he says. "This time, we are using one more generator -enough
to light up another row of houses next to Ang Mo Kio."

Some 500 tonnes of equipment and props, including 160 tonnes of steel for the
structure of the stage, will be shipped and flown here.

It seems Jackson will cart in his own kitchen and air-conditioners to be put
on stage to cool him down as he goes about his sizzling dance numbers.

Over here, Mr Loh has to look for a host of equipment and material, including
toilets, about 12,000 chairs and 36,000 sq ft of plywood.

It will take almost a week to prepare for the concert, he adds.

Work will begin on the Sunday before the concert on Oct 25, and a crane will
have to be moved into the stadium for the process.

Mr Loh will be helped by 800 crew members, who will be working 10 hours each
over that period of time.

On the day of the concert, 170 security men, 170 ticket collectors and 160
ushers will be employed to ensure that things run smoothly when the expected
crowd of 36,000 turns up.

As a result of all the effort and the staggering logistics, the audience can
expect to see a lot of visual effects using video, virtual reality, lights and
spectacular pyrotechnics, says Lushington Entertainments director Michael
Roche, who watched the MJ concerts in Amsterdam last week.

His company is promoting the HIStory concerts here and in Kuala Lumpur.

"The consensus among those who saw it is that it is a much slicker show with a
lot more drama," he says.

"He only broke down to cry once," he adds.

He observes that Jackson seemed "much more at ease" and was "having fun and
enjoying himself on stage".

Without revealing too much that will spoil the surprises, he says fans should
watch the guitarist closely and look out for some surprises when Jackson
performs Beat It.

He adds that there will also be a 60-minute countdown before the start of the
concert. Fans can look forward to fancy footwork from Jackson and his eight
dancers.

One can also expect some splitting images with the use of a big screen that
has a tracking system, called the Jumbotron, adds Mr Loh, who also went to the
concerts in Amsterdam.

"There is a lot of work which goes into ensuring that the images are aligned
perfectly," he says.

The opening sequence, which has been described in reviews on the Internet,
uses a virtual reality film footage and has MJ bursting onto stage amidst much
pomp and pageantry in a gold spacesuit.

Says Mr Roche: "I have been following concerts since I was eight or nine years
old, and I still think there is something about Michael Jackson. His stage
presence is unbelievable."

Tickets selling well: Jackson"s concert aims to make HIStory here

from SINGAPORE STRAITS TIMES, 8 Oct 96

ABOUT 4,300 tickets priced at $200 for the Michael Jackson HIStory concert
have been sold out.

Certainly, Jacko's much-maligned reputation, with the reports of sex abuse of
children, has not had an effect on ticket sales.

Concert promoters Lushington Entertainments say only limited tickets are
available from the Overseas Union Bank, which has priority booking for its
card members.

The majority of the $200 tickets for seats in front of the stage went on sale
to the public on Sept 27. Those were sold out in two days.

Tickets priced at $125, which are for seats in the sheltered grandstand are
also "moving fast". Also popular are the $55 tickets for the free-seating
section in the gallery.

Show promoters say tickets are also selling well to Jackson fans from the
region. One fan flew here from Indonesia to buy 100 tickets for friends and
family members.

Tickets at $55, $125 and $160 are available from Sistic outlets. OUB card
members are encouraged to call the Sistic hotline on 348-5555 soon for
preferred seats.
