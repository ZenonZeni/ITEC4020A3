<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">CanTalk Inc. founded in October 1993, is headquartered
in Winnipeg, Manitoba and is the solely Canadian-owned company to offer the
business community a broad selection of language and cultural services "on
demand" using the fax, phone, E-Mail and Internet. With quality and custom
design as its touchstones, CanTalk is not only a new way to market language
services with leading edge technology but also a new method by which Canadian
businesses and public services can gain rapid access to those services. Offering
the customer greater choices and convenience in language services, using
telecommunications technology, serves a unique market niche. The provision
of language services in a call centre format is also a strong feature
differentiating CanTalk from traditional language services. Because of these
distinctions, CanTalk is very well positioned to provide what the customer
needs...when they want it. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In alliance with Canadian telephone companies and
serving a national customer base, CanTalk is a network of nearly 1,000
professional and certified interpreters and translators, skilled in the diverse
languages and cultures of centres throughout North America and the world.
In addition to its own network, CanTalk has forged major alliances across
Canada with traditional, seasoned language companies, as well as business
organizations and companies with strong ties to key markets. Not only are
they resource pools, but also a source of customer leads and buy-ins. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In Canada, the language and cultural services market
is in its infancy but rapidly gaining momentum. AT&amp;T'S Language Line,
and Interpretel's entry into the Canadian market, speak to the opportunities
for this service. They are filling a service void that no other Canadian
company to date has filled. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">To achieve growth, businesses are waking up to
the reality that they must market directly to culturally diverse customer
bases. In this light, CanTalk is both a solution and opportunity. It provides
a rapid, convenient and affordable solution to language and cultural barriers
that often get in the way of conducting business in North America and around
the world. Frustrations can be turned into revenue generating opportunities.
Improving communication links from one country and from one community to
the next can solve problems on the spot, forge new relationships with clients
and enhance existing ones. As a cost-effective communications tool, CanTalk
can value-add to almost any current service and complement any existing
infrastructure. With a comprehensive mix of language and cultural services
geared to the user's convenience, CanTalk is positioned to ensure affordability,
accuracy, reliable delivery, above all, easy access and simplicity of use
for the customer. All that is required is a phone, fax or computer. This
will have wide appeal for a multitude of business sectors in the Canadian,
American and international markets. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The company was established with equity capital
funding by the founders and a federal government support program. The CanTalk
management team brings 50 years of combined project management experience
that embraces communications and marketing; management of interpreters and
translators in an international setting; administration of large budgets
and staff; information systems management; computer technology and design,
as well as the design of numerous technically oriented programs for consumer
groups; and strong experience in telecommunications and engineering projects
involving several significant product and service introductions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Using Manitoba as a template, CanTalk is advancing
its service within a framework of local linguistic diversity and resources
with the geographic advantage of a central time zone. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Some of CanTalk's significant customers that are
coming on line include: Investors Financial Group, representing a 40,000-customer
base in the mortgage area; the Manitoba government and its overseas initiatives;
the Canadian Bar Association of Ontario (CBAO), representing 14,000 members;
Vista Medical, representing thousands of clients; and Manitoba Telephone
System call centres with potentially hundreds of calls per week. CanTalk
is currently in the process of negotiating with major customer groups including
the federal government of Canada, a large North America-wide call centre,
major Hotels and a Canadian airline company. Business alliances being negotiated
include the Canadian Business Service Centre in Winnipeg (with Industry Canada),
and the Asia Pacific Foundation. As well, there are alliances with sophisticated
Internet providers who are aggressively marketing to large customer bases.

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">With the capability to provide service seven days
a week, 24 hours a day, CanTalk offers up to 80 languages used in North American
cities and many countries worldwide. As well, it can provide customs and
cultural information for over 20 countries. At the core of its service is
a language centre administering an initial network of approximately 1,000
professional and certified interpreters and translators, secured with legal
contracts and working on a scheduled basis. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">CanTalk's custom design focus and specialized language
services, backed by personalized service, are its key attributes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Where oral interpretation is needed, customers
are connected to interpreters in third-party conference call arrangements
- customer initiated or CanTalk aided. All interpretation services are geared
to convenience and the needs of the customer. With written translation, documents
by fax and E-mail are given turnaround guarantees. Requests for information
and cultural consultation requirements are handled in much the same manner.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The CanTalk language service centre connects customers
by phone in "live" or real time conference call arrangements to a network
of professional Canadian interpreters. They can provide consecutive
interpretation over the phone on an immediate (less than two minutes), callback
(less than 10 minutes) or pre-booked (2 hours to 2 weeks) basis. Where
translation is required, fax calls are directed to CanTalk's certified
translators, who will translate short documents by fax within three to six
hours. Longer documents take 12 hours or longer depending on customer
requirements. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Many provisions for maintaining confidentiality
have been implemented. Great care is taken to ensure the rights and privacy
of each customer is maintained. Not only are our interpreters and translators
legally contracted with confidentiality clauses and a code of ethics, they
are bound as well to their own professional code of ethics. The language
service centre operation is also equipped with a number of security provisions
- the name of the client never has to be revealed to an interpreter or
translator. <BR>

<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">CanTalk's language services - the multiplicity
of offerings backed by telecommunications solutions, geared to the convenience
and affordability of the user &ugrave; have entered a large window of
opportunity. At a time of rising interest in language services, due largely
to globalization of business and more businesses embracing cultural diversity
in their customer relations, the potential has never been greater. It is
everywhere. The CanTalk concept, with telco backing has unlimited opportunity
in the Canadian, North American and international markets. The strongest
potential can be seen in the areas of travel, tourism and hospitality, call
centres, education, international marketing, financial institutions, governments
and healthcare. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Nationally, Most Canadian organizations and businesses
have no reliable information and user system in place for the approximately
two to three per cent of the population that will never speak either official
language (Statistics Canada). By the year 2000, visible minorities comprising
20% of the population are expected to have a per capita GDP higher proportionally
than the rest of the Canadian population.Their purchasing power will rise
from $76 billion to $310 billion by the year 2000. To better serve customers
who prefer to speak other languages, there is growing awareness that providing
language support opens the door to new customer growth. This is evidenced
by the number of major institutions, Air Canada, Toronto Dominion Bank, call
centres, insurance companies and other businesses that hire multilingual
service representatives. This is also a time when federal cutbacks will
dramatically affect the current service providers on the immigration front
lines. Government has given some clear signals that they would like to move
away from the cost of servicing multiculturalism and all its ancillary
services.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">On the international front is the federal and
provincial government's push to make Canada competitive. Government now
recognizes the engine of growth are the small and mid-size companies that
comprise over 95% of all Canadian businesses and provide 80% of all new jobs
in Canada. Many companies are now focusing on export trade. To be successful,
these companies need to identify export opportunities and yet don't have
the time, resources and money to equip themselves with all the tools and
services that would help them capitalize on international market
opportunities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">i) Traditional Language Providers....What's
been missing?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Although there are many small and large commercial
organizations across Canada providing interpretation and translation services,
to date, no Canadian company has attempted to organize a national language
service built on telecommunications technology and rapid response. These
companies provide general document translation services and on-site simultaneous
services. Most interpretation is done in a face-to-face encounter with
interpreters on-site where the interpretation is needed. Rates for professional
services vary according to the skill of the interpreter, but have highs and
lows. They range from a fixed $450 a day for conference interpreting to $60.00
an hour for court interpretation, even though an interpreter may not be used
for the entire time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Most of the translation services provided across
Canada are geared for lengthier documents with a translation turnaround of
12 to 24 hours. Rates vary enormously from province to province and depending
on supply and demand factors in a region, may range anywhere from 15 cents
to 35 cents per word.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The current practice of providing immediate
multilingual services within public-service oriented organizations is often
based on a sporadic, unorganized and unsatisfactory process. Typically, if
there is a requirement for a quick language service, people within the
organization scramble trying to locate someone who has that particular language
skill to assist. When the service is available, community interpreters from
not-for-profit language firms may be used. This, however, takes additional
time and for obvious reasons, cannot be used to provide an immediate response
to a situation. CanTalk's research efforts have shown that telephone language
services are available from a few firms in Canada who provide services with
prearranged conference calls and in a few cases, within a 15 to 20 minute
time frame. All of these services are localized and provide language support
for hospitals, police and other social agencies. They have no sophisticated
delivery or time-sensitive system for rapid language response. Multilingual
staff are being hired, which helps to cover some language needs, but a business
usually cannot cover all language needs for every situation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The realities of Canada's demographics create
social need...<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Immigration is a powerful factor behind the changing
demographics in Canada. Major cities, once principally monolingual, continue
to become multicultural and multilingual. The number of visible minorities
will rise to about 5.7 million in 2001- an increase of over 3.5 times during
the 15 years. In % from 6.3 to 17.7 per cent. With the arrival of large numbers
of people, many now from Asiatic countries who make up Canada's immigrant
populations of 250,000 annually, the need becomes strikingly real. Many cannot
speak English well enough to apply for government services, deal with a utility
company or use the phone when an emergency arises. The ordeal of making a
telephone call may be enough to avoid doing business over the phone. Feeling
intimidated, many may remain on the margins of society for years, never fully
being able to participate. The need for interpreting services is evident
in schools, hospitals, police departments, airline companies... wherever
there is a business or agency that relies on the patronage of Canadians and
where Canadians rely on a business. Moreover, there is clear evidence of
Francophone and Anglo populations have difficulty communicating at a commerce
level across provincial borders and inter-provincially. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Globalization and international
markets.....</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">According to a 1995 Conference Board of Canada
Study, their is a critical need for Canada to increase it share of world
trade and expand its trade portfolio. In 25 of the largest free-market economies
in the world, only 17% speak English as a first language. The fastest growing
economies are found in countries where English is least likely to be spoken
- Indonesia and Mexico. Shifting and potential markets in places like the
Baltic States, Russia, and China offer long term opportunities for trade
but they also have non-native English speaking populations. Overseas trips
are not always affordable for businesses and interpreters on site can be
expensive. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Subsequently, there is a greater need to use the
phone more and travel less. According to language experts, only so much can
happen in English. Mistakes and miscommunication can occur quickly without
skilled interpreters...cultural nuances get missed, essential rapport doesn't
develop. Universal as English may be, it is proven that conducting business
in a native language is still the most effective way to make sure the message
is understood.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Keeping customers in today's marketplace directly implies
understanding and responding to their needs quickly, no matter where they
are located. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">From CanTalk survey of small and mid size businesses,
it was revealed that businesses have few options to access a reliable and
convenient service. Many manage by dealing only in countries where English
is spoken. This limits opportunities for their growth. </FONT> 
  <HR>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">WHAT WE KNOW -THE REALITIES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Some Facts...<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">A $200,000 language needs survey of Manitoba businesses
and funded by three levels of government ( the first survey of its kind in
North America) showed that the need for language services has been " grossly
underestimated...<I>it's like sitting on oil and we can't drill"</I> says
Susan MacDonald project leader for the one year survey. Once language service
is provided she says, businesses want to keep using them. Out of approximately
400 businesses who returned the survey, 171 wanted a list of interpreters
and translators, and 98 of those "wanted ease of access to affordable
services".<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Nationally, many Canadian organizations and businesses
have no reliable system of providing <I>on demand </I>language services and
it often falls to volunteer organizations. Yet, there is increased recognition
that providing language support opens the door to new business growth. This
is evidenced by the number of major institutions that have hired multilingual
operators or service providers. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">On the global front is the push to become more
competitive. In Canada, not unlike the United States, the engine of growth
are the small and mid size companies that comprise over 95% of all Canadian
businesses and provide 80% of all new jobs in Canada. Many are now being
focused for export trade. However, many don't have the time, resources and
money to find all the tools that will help take advantage of all the
opportunities in the newly emerging international markets. Yet there remains
a constant pressure among all levels of North American business to improve-
do better and with less dollars. Travel less - use the phone more.<I><B>
<BR>
</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">From the same Conference Board of Canada report
report<I> "heavy reliance on traditional markets of the United States, Japan
and the United Kingdom and avoidance of what was once considered Third World
countries with GDP rates of up to 12% will relegate Canadian business to
the slow lane of international commerce".<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">From a CanTalk survey of small and mid size businesses,
it was revealed that businesses have few options to access a reliable and
convenient language service. For the most part, they were unaware of even
what translation resources might be available. They avoid countries where
English is not spoken or rely on family, friends and staff to assist in their
language needs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Primary competition to CanTalk is AT&amp;T with
a recent aggressive push of their <I>Language Line </I>service into the Canadian
market. Also, <I>Interpretel</I> out of Tucson Arizona with a Canadian shell
that packages a cross section of telecommunication services. They both use
AT&amp;T's U.S. based interpreters and translators in Monterey California.
