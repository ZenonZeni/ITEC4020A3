<CENTER><B>What's CEC Newsworthy?<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
     The <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I> provides general tips on how to access and use the media to your best advantage.  But how do you know what issues the press will really respond to and want to give coverage to?  And what should your main goals be in your interactions with the media?  Here are some guidelines:<BR>
<CENTER><B>Your Four CEC PR Goals</B><BR>
</CENTER><li>To serve the goal of improving educational outcomes for students with exceptionalities.<BR>
<li>To heighten the visibility, understanding, and appreciation of special educators.<BR>
<li>To increase CEC membership.<BR>
<li>To increase the recruitment of persons into the special education profession.<BR>
<CENTER><B><BR>
Is it News?</B><BR>
</CENTER>One of these three elements can be found in stories that get press coverage:<BR>
<li><B>     Increasing public awareness</B> -- By increasing public awareness of the truth, you provide a balanced view of the issues at stake.  Stories can expose the peril of the alternatives or provide solutions.<BR>
<li><B>     Solutions to a problem</B> -- When your product or service (e.g., membership/conference) provides a solution to a problem or meets the needs of an audience, publicity can be generated.<BR>
<li><B>     Responding as an expert</B> -- Press will seek you out when you are perceived as being a credible expert in a field.<BR>
<BR>
Your story ideas can relate to the following as well: current events, recognized achievement, area of influence, large interest base, human interest, milestones, controversy, personal significance, or neighborhood factors.<P>
