<H3><A NAME="#DESC"></A>Course Description</H3>

<P>This course is intended to help you make the transition from mathematics
student to mathematics teacher. You will be asked to confront a wide range
of problems related to mathematics instruction. </P>

<P>General topics for the course will include understanding individual
students' conceptions of mathematics, organizing for instruction, the current
mathematics education reform movements, mathematics curricular issues,
assessment of student understanding, using open-ended investigation, cooperative
learning, use of technological tools and manipulative materials, and multicultural
and equity concerns. </P>

<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to top</A> </P>

<H3><A NAME="ACT"></A>Course Activities</H3>

<P>Short-term assignments will include mathematical investigations and
activities (some completed in and some out of class), lesson designs, summary
and critique of selected readings, and an assessment project. All participants
will keep a reflective journal in which they respond to the course activities
and their readings, as well as to assigned questions. A major project focused
on a topic of mathematical content, pedagogical method, or current issue
will include a classroom presentation and a paper. The participants will
also create a portfolio demonstrating their development and understanding
related to the course content. </P>

<P>Readings will come from the required text and other sources distributed
in class or made available through the instructor. </P>

<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to top</A> </P>

school</I> (2nd Ed.). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Merrill. </P>

<P>OPTIONAL popular school mathematics software is available for purchase
at discount prices in the UB bookstore. It is highly recommended, although
not required, that you purchase your own graphing calculator. Instruction
in the use of the TI-82 will be provided in class. Models somewhat comparable
in price and features include the <A HREF="http://www.ti.com/calc/docs/83.htm">TI-83</A>,

<P>All students should have access to e-mail. The course will use an e-mail
discussion list for dissemination of information and for discussion. An
account on the UB UNIX system is highly recommended. You can <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/computing/liaison/accounts.html">apply
for accounts</A> at the <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/computing/liaison">User
Liaison Office</A> in 215 Computing Center and get software for connecting

<H3><A NAME="SPEC"></A>Special Needs</H3>

<P>If you have a diagnosed disability (physical, learning, or psychological)
which will make it difficult for you to carry out the course work as outlined,
or, requires accommodations such as recruiting note takers, readers, or
extended time on exams and/or assignments, please advise me during the
first two weeks of the course so we may review possible arrangements for
reasonable accommodations. </P>

<P><A HREF="#TOP">Return to top</A> </P>

<H3><A NAME="EVAL"></A>Evaluation</H3>

<P>Grades will be based on the following components: Classroom and homework
assignments 50%, major project 30%, journal 10%, and portfolio 10%. </P>

<P>Note that all assignments will be collected during class on the due
date. Due to the number of participants in the course, I will probably
not be able to give the same detail of feedback to late assignments as
to those submitted on time. If you have a problem with submitting an assignment
on time, discuss it with me as soon as possible. I generally will not accept
an assignment more than one week late.</P>

<H4><A NAME="JOUR"></A>JOURNALS</H4>

<P>Reflective journaling is a teaching technique which has recently gained
great prominence. In this course, students will be required to keep a journal
and to add to it weekly. In some cases topics for the journal entries will
be assigned, but more frequently the choice will be left to you. The purpose
of the journal is to provide a forum for individual critical reflection
on topics and issues raised in classes or in readings. Your journal entries
should not be merely a summary of class discussions or readings, but should
deal with personal reactions and concerns, applications of ideas you have
encountered, connections you have noted, reflections on your past experience
as a student or teacher, musings, and so on. The entries should demonstrate
your ability to reflect and expand on issues related to the course which
concern you personally. Self-analysis and growth should be evident. The
journals will be collected periodically for feedback from the instructor
and will be evaluated at the end of the course on the basis of their thoughtfulness
and the contribution to your individual engagement with the content of
the course. Each weekly entry should be at least two hand-written pages
long.</P>

<H4><A NAME="PROJ"></A>MAJOR PROJECT</H4>

<P>The major project for the course should be focused on a specific, well-defined
topic related to the teaching of mathematics in the secondary or middle
school. Topics could include the teaching of a particular mathematical
content area (e.g., the Pythagorean Theorem), a particular pedagogical
technique (e.g., cooperative learning), or an educational issue related
to curriculum (e.g., What are basic skills?), instruction (e.g. When should
students use calculators?), or assessment (e.g., How do you assess problem
solving ability?) in secondary school mathematics. Other topics could include
the connection of broader educational issues to mathematics (e.g., equity
and bias issues). </P>

<P>The project will include a paper, a set of lesson plans, and a classroom
presentation. </P>

<H5>Introductory Paper</H5>

<P>The introductory paper should describe in approximately 10 double-spaced
typed pages: </P>

<UL>
<LI>the topic to be addressed </LI>

<LI>research and theory related to the topic </LI>

<LI>how the NCTM Standards relate to the topic </LI>

<LI>methodological issues motivating your lessons </LI>

<LI>introduction to your lessons-What should we see? What do your lessons
exemplify? How do they address the issues described earlier in the paper?
</LI>
</UL>

<H5>Lesson Plans</H5>

<P>Develop five lessons (do not have to be five consecutive days). These
lesson plans should illustrate the issues raised in the introductory paper
and how you would deal with these issues. For each lesson describe: </P>

<UL>
<LI>CONTENT and AUDIENCE: Describe the mathematical content you plan to
have the students investigate and the audience intended. Include your objectives
for the students. </LI>

<LI>TEACHER'S ACTIVITY: Describe what the teacher would do or say. </LI>

<LI>ACTIVITY: Describe what you would have the students do and include
any written instructions or materials you would provide the students. </LI>

<LI>ASSESSMENT: Describe how you would determine if the students had met
your expectations. What instruments would you use and what would you look
for? </LI>

<LI>ANTICIPATIONS: What difficulties do you anticipate the students having?
How would you deal with these difficulties? </LI>
</UL>

<H5>Classroom Presentation</H5>

<P>You will be responsible for 30 minutes of class time. During this time
you should provide an overview of your topic. A significant portion of
the time should involve your classmates and professor in an activity that
illustrates the issues addressed in your project so that we can understand
your topic through our own experience rather than by simply being told.
You should also distribute a four-page hand-out to the class.</P>
