ADVANCED FIBER TECHNOLOGIES BRING RAY OF HOPE TO BELEAGUERED
CABLE INDUSTRY

     While the threat of regulatory intervention set an ominous
tone for the Western Cable Show held December 13-15 in Anaheim,
CA, advances in the use of fiber technology to improve the
picture quality, reliability and channel capacity of cable TV
systems dominated the exhibit floor.  "Fiber trunking is just
beginning," said Jim Chiddix, senior vice president of
engineering and technology at cable multiple system operator ATC.
"There were only a few systems installed in 1988, a couple
hundred in 1989, and we're expecting a thousand or so in 1990,"
he said.
     Cable operators are hoping that better picture quality and
greater system reliability will translate into happier customers-
-and take the heat of pending reregulation off the cable
industry.  "More than half of cable subscribers cite picture
quality and reliability--and, more importantly quick response to
difficulties that arise--as problems facing the cable industry,"
says Nick Hamilton Piercy, vice president of engineering and
technical services for Rogers Cable TV in Canada.  With that in
mind, Piercy says Rogers' experimental system in Toronto features
a fiber backbone ring structure that can send signals in both
directions if service is interrupted.  "There's self-healing if
there is a cut," he says.  In addition, the installation of a
secondary ring reduces the number of subscribers served per hub.
It also cuts the amount of coaxial cable (and therefore the
number of amplifiers or power boosters) between the headend and
homes.

CABLE'S FIBER CHALLENGE: ADAPTING OPTICAL DEVICES TO CATV ANALOG
NEEDS

     Reducing the number of devices between the signal source and
subscribers is essential to improve signal power and reduce
picture noise and distortion.  But off-the-shelf laser devices
(built for digital transmission) need to be adapted to the analog
requirements of cable television, says ATC's Chiddix.  Most
optical components developed for digital modulation in
telecommunications were designed for simply turning on and off
high-speed signals, and therefore encounter difficulties when
used to transmit compressed video information in analog form.
     Nonetheless, advances in distributive feedback (DFB) lasers
are resulting in higher power from cable headends with lower
noise and distortion, reports Dave Robinson, director of Jerrold
Division's Cableoptics.  Robinson notes that the first high-
performance lasers built with cable applications in mind
(manufactured by Ortel Corp.) resulted in a 3-5 dB carrier to
noise improvement in Jerrold's second-generation AM Fiber Optics
Backbone system.
     Jerrold's new system can now deliver 80 channels (an
increase of 35 channels) on two fibers for 10 miles with a 56 dB
carrier to noise ratio.  Field trials will begin in April or May
in Cablevision systems in the Northeast, with volume purchases
expected in July, Jerrold's John Burke tells VTN.
     Robinson says Jerrold will continue to take fiber "to-the-
tap" (the tap is a device installed in cable feeder lines that
provides signals to the subscriber's drop), rather than all the
way into the home--at least for the next 10 years.  "Coaxial drop
has one gigahertz (GHz) capability and there is a large cost
penalty extending beyond the tap directly into the home," he
said.
     On the drawing board are optical amplifiers to replace
current devices.  Howard Westlake, research engineer at British
Telecom Research defines optical amplifiers as "devices that
increase the intensity of an optical signal without translating
the signal between an optical and electrical regime."  Westlake
says advantages of optical amplifiers include their compactness,
low component requirements and wide bandwidth capacity for system
upgrades for HDTV and other enhanced services.

CABLE SYSTEM BANDWIDTH INCREASING, BUT THERE MAY BE POINT OF
DIMINISHING RETURNS
     Despite skepticism, cable operators are adamant that
consumer appetite for more and more channels will continue,
either for greater variety of programming, or for future
bandwidth-intensive services such as HDTV, video-on-demand and
two-way interactive services.  Rogers' Piercy, for example,
forecasts a rise in system channel capacity from the current 35-
40 level to 58 channels by the end of 1990, 77 channels by 1993
and possibly 150 channels by 1998.
     With the addition of channels, cable systems have seen a
corresponding evolution of bandwidth from 200 MHz to the 550 MHz
systems shown in force on the exhibit floor--and the industry is
talking about a further increase to a one GHz platform.  However,
one GHz systems may be 8-9 years away, says Intermedia consultant
Dave Large, and "it may not be as simple to make increased
bandwidth increments" as it was in the past.  For example, while
new fiber backbone systems decrease amplifier cascades (or the
number of amplifiers in a sequence), maintenance costs for
amplifiers are not eliminated and signal leakage is still
unaffected.  Furthermore, optical amplifiers for one GHz fiber AM
backbone systems are "a long time in coming--hopefully available
by 1998," adds Bob Young, director of product marketing at
Jerrold.
     But Large says the most daunting problem may lie in homes.
While cable equipment manufacturers are doing their best to
eliminate set-top converters (see story next page), consumer TV
sets will not be able to tune in the ever-increasing number of
channels unless manufacturers change their TV design.  In
addition, home automation standards (such as the EIA's CEbus)
can't handle one GHz signals.

SOLUTIONS TO CABLE'S CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INTERFACE PROBLEM ONLY
ADDING CONFUSION

     Several solutions have been proposed to solve the cable
industry's consumer electronics interface problem (which for
millions of viewers has resulted in a mass of wires and devices
on top of TV sets and the inability to use remote controls.)  But
close investigation of the alternatives only leads to more
confusion, says Alex Best, senior vice president of engineering
at Cox Cable.  "The optimal conditional access device has not yet
been invented," he said.  But trials by cable equipment
manufacturers continue.
     Alternatives include: 1) cigarette pack-sized Multiport
addressable decoders which connect directly into a Multiport plug
in the back of TVs and VCRs; 2) off-premise equipment on a
telephone pole or tap that serves a number of subscribers; 3) on-
premise equipment placed on the side of a home that serves one
subscriber; and 4) "universal" remotes that can control a variety
of consumer products.
     At best, Multiport decoders are only expected to penetrate
5-15% of the 98.7 million addressable subscribers forecast for
1997, says Claude Baggett, director of systems engineering at
CableLabs.  (That is if the Multiport ever gets off the ground at
all, since TV and VCR manufacturers are reluctant to go to the
expense of putting the plug in their products.)  A market for the
Multiport will only develop if VCR manufacturers get into the
act, says Baggett, since TVs have longer lives and will therefore
take longer to be replaced by consumers.  At the Western Show,
Jerrold was showing its EIA Multiport Unit to gauge market
reaction.
     On and off-premise devices offer numerous advantages over
the Multiport, most notably the ability to connect and disconnect
without service calls and the transmission of "clean"
(unscrambled) signals from the headend, which reduces signal
degradation.
     At the Western show, Scientific-Atlanta introduced its
Addressable Interdiction system, which delivers broadband signals
to as many outlets (TVs or VCRs) as required in four subscriber
homes.  Signals for pay services are scrambled using a "jamming"
technique that can encrypt up to 32 channels.  Testing of the
Addressable Interdiction system is now underway at Warner Cable
Communications' Williamsburg, VA system.  A total of 250 homes
will be passed by late this month, with testing lasting over a
year.  Scientific-Atlanta says the system can also be configured
in an on-premise format.
     The advantage of on-premise over off-premise is that the
costs per subscriber always equals the cost per port.  (With
Scientific-Atlanta's 4-port system, if one home is a non-
subscriber, the port goes unused--though non-subscribers can be
sold pay-per-view programming).  Jerrold is now trialing its
Starport on-premise device in Tele-Communications Inc. systems
and hopes to have a prototype in production later this month.
     Zenith, which is "still looking into on and off-premise
technology," is pushing the "universal" remote concept with the
introduction of the PCC-IQ "learning" multibrand remote control,
which can be programmed to operate 41 brands of TV sets, 40
brands of VCRs and 50 brands of cable converters.  It can also
learn up to 120 separate functions to control any other device
operated by infrared commands, such as stereos and compact disc.
Shipments are expected first quarter 1990 at about $30 to cable
operators.

FCC ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL SEE ANOTHER EXTENSION, SIMULCAST
SYSTEMS GAIN FAVOR

     The consensus at the Western show was that the FCC's
Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Services, whose life
was already extended by two years beyond its November 1989
expiration date (VTN, May 15, 1989, p. 3), will need another one-
to two-year extension to complete its task of recommending an
advanced television standard for the U.S.
     Craig Tanner, vice president of advanced television projects
at CableLabs, says that despite the lengthy process of bringing
HDTV to consumers, it's unlikely that the U.S. will follow Tele-
Communication, Inc.'s recommended course of "leapfrogging" analog
HDTV technology by directly implementing digital HDTV as the
technology develops (VTN, April 3, 1989, p. 1).  "It's an
attractive idea but it exists only in concept at this point," he
says.
     Tanner notes that advanced TV experts are leaning toward the
selection of a simulcast system that concurrently transmits one
NTSC signal and one non NTSC-compatible HDTV signal through two
separate 6 MHz channels.  Such a system would leave the HDTV
channel free from the technological constraints of NTSC, and,
eventually, spectrum devoted to original NTSC channels could be
used for other applications (including more advanced versions of
HDTV).
     HDTV transmission proponent North American Philips has
already announced that it is developing a simulcast system it
hopes to submit late in the testing cycle (VTN, Sept. 25, 1989,
p. 3).  Also, the David Sarnoff Research Center is reportedly
working on a simulcast system based on its two-phase augmentation
ACTV system.

CICIORA: CABLE SHOULD WORK ON NTSC IMPROVEMENTS WHILE WAITING FOR
HDTV

     Given the likelihood of delays in testing and standard
setting by the FCC, we won't see HDTV receivers in stores until
Christmas 1994.  Meanwhile, cable should concentrate on
improvements in NTSC delivery, says Walt Ciciora, vice president
of technology for ATC and chairman of CableLabs Technical
Advisory Committee.  "For a long time, NTSC was so much better
than consumer electronics could deliver, and it didn't make sense
to make transmission better than what could be displayed.  Now
the reverse is true," he said.  NTSC enhancements need to be made
not only in the receiver (such as those developed by Faroudja
Laboratories), but in the headend as well through new fiber and
amplifier technologies (see page 1).
     Improving NTSC technology will also prepare the industry for
advanced television.  "HDTV needs more channels, less noise, less
distortion and reduced microreflection--the same requirements for
improved NTSC," said Ciciora.  If the cable industry takes
appropriate steps to improve NTSC, "we'll be in an excellent
position to deliver HDTV long before anyone is willing to spend
money on it".

IMMINENT INVASION OF HDTV VCRs A BOGEYMAN, LONG TERM IMPROVEMENTS
ARE THE THREAT

     Some industry observers, including CableLabs' Tanner,
suspect HDTV may achieve significant penetration of homes sooner
than many predict.  A set of HDTV technologies, including
compression, display, transmission and production, are in "a
state of near readiness," and only need refinement, packaging and
cost reduction for consumer acceptance, says Tanner.  "We should
never underestimate the ability of the Japanese to manufacture at
high volume and low cost," he says.
     But an imminent invasion of Japanese HDTV VCRs will be
staved off by the "consumer electronics constraint," more
commonly known as the chicken-and-the-egg problem, contends
Ciciora.  The long-term development of large screen televisions
and VCRs (or TV/VCR combinations) are the real threat to cable,
since they don't confront the same signal processing problems
that the cable industry faces.  "Over the next 10-15 years, the
TV and VCR baseband path will go from four to nine to 15 to over
20 MHz.  There is no need to compress, so they won't need to
compromise," he says.

CABLE REREGULATION--INCLUDING PROVISIONS FOR TELCO ENTRY--LESS
THAN CERTAIN IN '90

     Even if some type of reregulation of the cable industry is
implemented this year, any bill from Congress is unlikely to
include provisions for telco entry into the video business, said
Congressional staffers speaking at the Western show.  FCC
Chairman Al Sikes has already put in motion the Commission's
review of cable that was originally scheduled to start next
October.  A report providing guidelines for possible reregulation
is expected to be submitted to Congress by the end of July.
     "There is a consensus building that telcos will be in the
cable business, though only as a gateway and not allowed to own
programming," says Toni Cook, Majority Counsel of the Senate
Commerce Committee.  "But there is no consensus as to when that
should happen."  Though cable legislation is "inevitable," the
severity of the bill "is anything but certain," adds Minority
Counsel Terry Haines of the House Commerce Committee.  Haines
says "telco entry is an issue whose time has not come," and says
the FCC's report--if it redefines competition or takes other
significant moves that assuage the concerns of Congress members--
could "take a lot of air out of the legislative balloon."
     Ira Goldman, legislative assistant to Sen. Pete Wilson (R-
CA) says if cable rate regulation does occur, it will take away
one of telco's main contentions for entering the video business--
lower rates through increased competition.  "It may be a great
political move by the cable industry to acquiesce to
legislation," he says.

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS URGE CABLERS TO "TURN SYNDEX INTO
PROFITS"

     Hampering prospects for happier cable customers is the
implementation of syndication exclusivity ("syndex") regulations
begun January 1, which requires cable operators offering
programming duplicated by broadcasters to replace those slots
with alternative material.  At the Western show, manufacturers of
commercial ad insertion equipment, routing switchers and
character generators took the opportunity to peddle their gear as
a way to "turn syndex into profits" by substituting local
information and advertising.
     No cable show would be complete without a few potshots
thrown between cable operators and telcos. In a panel session on
telco entry into cable, Tele-Communications, Inc. Senior Vice
President John Sie said the unwillingness of telcos to drop basic
telephone rates was evidence of their intent to use
"institutional cross subsidy" for widespread fiber installation.
"If [the telcos] can offer the cable industry a video dial tone
on a open architecture basis, then we should be able to lease
that channel, repackage it and sell phone services at a much
cheaper price," he said.
     Pioneer Communications announced the compatibility of its
laserdisc format with the Eidak system for copy-protected pay-
per-view.  Pioneer was at the show pushing its pay-per-view event
library system, the Pioneer LaserDisc Universal System (VTN, Dec.
18, 1989, p. 8).  Though the technology "is in the works," Eidak
officials say they're not yet ready to announce the availability
of "Eidakizing" a laserdisc as yet.  Eidak was at the show laying
the groundwork for introduction of its satellite-delivered anti-
copy technology for cable systems.  The company also announced
that CableLabs will join major MSOs TCI and Continental as
minority investors in Eidak Corp.
     CableLabs approved a $3.5 million 1990 operating budget at
its annual meeting in Anaheim, with almost $2 million to be spent
on research and development.  Scheduled R&D joint ventures
include an effort with Jerrold's Applied Media Lab to investigate
NTSC picture quality parameters, including five basic forms of
signal degradation (noise, intermodulation, microreflections,
envelope delay and phase noise) and an agreement with Scientific-
Atlanta to research future headend systems.  Anixter Cable TV
(Skokie, IL) introduced a dual laser version of its Laser Link
that allows cable operators to improve system performance by 3
dB.  The dual fiber system can carry 40, 60 or 80 channels, and
operators using a single Laser Link can upgrade to the dual
configuration with a simple plug-in module.

MANUFACTURERS: SHORT TERM PROSPECTS FOR VIDEO BLANK TAPE
STANDARDS NOT GOOD

     It's highly unlikely that we'll see quality standards set
for blank video tape similar to the Type I, II or IV grade
formats used in the audio cassette business--at least until
advanced video technologies raise consumers' quality
expectations.  Blank tape manufacturers surveyed by our sister
publication Video Marketing Newsletter said that 1) consumers
often can't appreciate higher tape quality given the image
quality limitations of existing TVs; 2) VCRs don't have switches
allowing the user to change the bias; and 3) even if they did,
few consumers would use them, since "most consumers aren't even
sure where the tracking control is on their VCR."  Consumers are
generally indifferent to quality now, but that may be changing
with the introduction of new technologies, says Peter Dyke,
national sales manager at TDK.  "As TV improves with high-
definition and S-VHS, people will begin to care about grade.
We've already seen an increase in high-grade tapes being sold."

KODAK DROPPING VIDEO PRESENTATION PRODUCTS, EPSON TO TAKE OVER
LCD PROJECTOR

     Eastman Kodak's decision to shed several subsidiaries will
include selling off its presentation technology division and
discontinuing the LCD-based LC500 Video Projector, a 70,400 line
resolution, full color portable projector for professional
markets.  The decision "is consistent with corporate plans to
focus our efforts... in our core business areas," says James
Parker, manager, American Zone Sales, for Kodak.
     The LC500, which has found a niche in industrial and
education presentation markets, will not disappear, however.
Kodak had been marketing the product in the U.S. since Fall 1988
under license from LC500 developer Seiko Epson Corp. of Japan,
and relinquished marketing rights in November to Epson America,
Inc.  Epson, which has been marketing the projector in Europe and
Japan since its inception, is keeping the unit on U.S. shelves as
the Epson Crystal Image Video Projector.  The projector will
retail near its former $3,495 price tag, says Epson spokesperson
Gary Yoshimura.  The company plans to expand the device's market
potential by promoting it as a standard peripheral display for
personal computers.  (Epson America, Inc., 2780 Lomita Blvd.,

CALIFORNIA FIRM TARGETS HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET WITH 3D MOVIES

     3D TV Corporation, a stereoscopic developer, has devised a
home video system enabling standard television sets and VCRs to
faithfully reproduce 3D images from encoded videocassettes.
     The $200 system, compatible with all videocassette formats
and most television  and computer brands, consists of a pair of
$50 LCD glasses and a $150 cigarette-package-sized Stereo Glasses
Driver.  When the LCD glasses and VCR are plugged into the
glasses driver, the TV screen emits alternating images--first for
the left eye and then for the right.  The glasses, in sequence
with the emitted images, cover the appropriate eye of the viewer
at a rate of 60 times per second so the picture appears in
continual 3D.
     Following its introduction this month at the Consumer
Electronics Show, 3D TV Corp. will begin marketing the system
with distribution through video specialty stores and mail order
firms.  Company President Michael Starks, who hopes to ship
20,000 units in the first six months of 1990, believes consumer
acceptance hinges on 3D software availability and development and
has therefore stockpiled a 20-title 3D library of feature films,
shorts and documentaries.  The 3D cassettes will retail at about
$50, but "could easily be dropped to $19.95 or sell at $79.95.
It's the same pricing strategy as standard videocassettes,"
Starks tells VTN.
    Based on interest expressed by numerus producers who have
recently filmed in 3D or are interested in tackling 3D
productions, Starks hopes to add about six new films to the
library within the next six months.  "There have been about four
or five unreleased 3D feature films made within the last year or
two, and there's always some old 3D `Bs' being discovered in
somebody's basement," he says.  (3D TV Corporation, Box 1650,
Ross, CA 94957; 415-479-3516.)

FLAT PANELS TO INCREASE SHARE OF TOTAL DISPLAY MARKET TO ALMOST
40% BY 1996

     The total world display market will grow from $12.85 billion
in 1989 to $30.42 billion in 1996, and flat panel displays (FPDs)
will increase their share of the market from 25% ($3.2 billion)
to 38% ($11.7 billion) within the same period, according to
figures presented by Stanford Resources, Inc. at its 1989 Flat
Information Display Conference and Exhibition last month in Santa
Clara, CA.
     According to Stanford Resources President Joseph Castellano,
flat panel displays have begun to replace cathode ray tubes in
portable computers, aircraft instruments and portable/table model
color TVs.  For example, FPDs were used in 1.46 million consumer
TVs in 1989, and that number will grow to 9.9 million units in
1996.  However, manufacturers must bring down the production
costs of FPD, as well as provide full color and higher pixel
counts if they are to replace CRTs in the very large TV and
computer segments, he says.
     Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) will continue to account for
the lion's share of FPD revenues (about 57% in 1989, growing to
62% in 1996).  Active matrix LCDs--which have performance levels
similar to that of today's standard cathode ray tube (CRT)--are
currently the focus of heavy investment in Japan.  The complexity
and cost of manufacturing have hampered the production of large-
screen active matrix LCDs though certain manufacturers have made
progress (such as Sharp's 14" LCD screen, VTN, June 12, 1989, p.
5).
     Will flat panel displays provide the missing link--a low-
cost large screen display--for the commercialization of HDTV?
Television manufacturers appear to have little confidence in
large screen FPDs, given the expansion plans for the manufacture
of large size CRTs by Thomson, Matsushita, Toshiba and Sony,
according to David Lachenbruch, editorial director of TV Digest.
Lachenbruch says one promising large screen technology may be LCD
projection systems like the 100" model recently introduced by
Sharp.
     Consultant Dr. Elliot Schlam, however, says flat panel
displays are the ultimate solution for HDTV displays.  CRTs,
which will be used for "improved" definition TV, are too bulky.
Projection systems take up too much space, though they may be
used for HDTV in the near and mid-term.

     *British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) has successfully
completed testing of the ITT D-MAC chip sets to be used in BSB
receivers for the launch of its direct broadcast satellite
service this spring.  ITT is scheduled to deliver 100,000 of the
chip sets in the next few months.  BSB has long contended its use
of D-MAC technology--and its compatibility with existing TV sets
and future widescreen and advanced formats--instead of PAL
technology has provided it with a "technological hammerlock" over
rival Sky Television.

     *ATC's Walt Ciciora says the possibility of accelerating the
setting of an HDTV standard by merging two or more of the
proposed systems faces serious obstacles.  The reasons: highly
divergent systems, large egos of the companies involved, and the
likelihood that "the little guys would cry foul."

     *While letterboxing has long been a staple of the laserdisc
market, one home video company--New Yorker Films (New York)--is
including the feature in a number of foreign language features.
Beth deVoe, director of home video for New Yorker, says the
company has always letterboxed its titles for broadcast, and saw
no reason to change the policy in home video.  "We're just taking
exactly what the filmmakers intended and putting it on the
cassette.  There is a slight problem because you have to make a
brand new 35mm print unsubtitled and then put it on cassette and
subtitle it.  It does cost a lot to do it our way, but our
audience are movie buffs, and they're glad we do it."

     *While the Societee Europeene des Satellites (SES) says that
transponder capacity of the Astra 1A satellite has been filled
with the addition of four new West German clients, full capacity
has been reached only because of technical problems that have
reduced the number of transponders in operation.  According to
our sister publication Satellite News, operational problems cut
the number of operational transponders from the 16 originally
intended down to 12.

     *AT&T Bell Labs has developed a prototype photonic
integrated circuit able to process two kilobits of optical
information in parallel, enough to route full motion video
signals through optical fiber.  Currently fiber optics
applications, such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
can transmit voice, data and still video over a single wire, but
have lacked the capacity to carry high bandwidth services such as
full motion video and HDTV.
