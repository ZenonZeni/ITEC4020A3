CRICKET VICTORY IS OPENING BOUNCER AS CABLE DECLARES WAR ON MURDOCH

UK cable operators led by the US regional telephone companies are
willing to invest large sums in cable-only programming to mount a major
challenge to British Sky Broadcasting's dominance of new-media
channels.  They say that their surprise #7.5 million purchase of all UK
rights to the 1996 Cricket World Cup will be the first of many
programme ventures in the near future.

The operators will bid for further sports rights, films and events and
look to launch new niche channels, including local and ethnic services.
 They will commission original British programming to compete against
``the more American'' Rupert Murdoch, 50-per-cent owner of BSkyB.  This
is likely to involve co-operative deals with independent television
companies and possibly investments in, as well as commissions for,
independent production companies.

The cable operators and telephone companies plan to launch an Asian
channel later this year, produced by Yorkshire Television.  A sports
channel is also likely to be launched, a spin-off from Wire TV, the
lifestyle and sports channel owned by the group which bought the
cricket rights.

The telephone companies, like the biggest of the cable operators,
TeleCommunications Inc, are rich enough to fund the drive towards more
and better programming.  As one telephone-company executive put it,
``the #7.5 million for cricket rights is small change if you look at
the millions we're putting into building cable.''

But what about the less rich, middle-sized cable companies?  Can
they afford programming investment?  According to the same executive,
``they recognise, as much as we do, that there is a ``need to create
cable-controlled production so Murdoch cannot go on telling us what to
do.''

Only the cable operators were prepared to offer the money being asked
for the World Cricket Cup rights asked by rights owner WorldTel.  There
was no bidding.

BSkyB, the BBC and Channel Four were interested -- but unwilling to talk
the same language (see separate story).

The cable operators argue that, although BSkyB's channels are the
programming powerhouse in UK new media, the situation must not be
allowed to continue ad infinitum.  They respect the pioneering work
done by Murdoch in developing satellite programming, but they are
determined that he should not be allowed to control the destiny of
cable because of his dominance in programming.

The cable operators have always regarded cable-only programming as
important, but the only operator with the cash and will to get into
programming in a major way has been TeleCommunications Inc.  TCI, which
transmits some of its channels on the Astra direct-to-home satellite,
spent many months persuading the operators to get together to form
Cable Programme Partners 1 to launch Wire TV last May.

CPP1, comprising three telephone companies (US West, Nynex and
Southwestern Bell) and two US cable operators (Comcast and TCI), has
gradually become a forum for strategic thinking on cable programming,
``no longer worrying about what's going to be on Wire at 7.30pm,'' as
one member put it (though by no means all the group is happy with the
channel).  The purchase of the Cricket World Cup rights has accelerated
this movement, galvanising the operators to consider: What next?

The CCP 1 operators will be joined by two others -- General Cable, which
has several franchises in Yorkshire, and Jones Cable, which runs the
Leeds franchise -- to launch a new Asian channel, Hum.  The operators,
which will form a new partnership (CPP 2), will provide some upfront
funding for production and start-up, but talks are continuing with
Yorkshire TV, which will produce the channel, over whether it will also
take a stake and over what kind of access it will have to advertising
time.

The operators do not believe that the existing channels, TV Asia,
AsiaNet (formerly Asiavision) and Namaste Asia Television, are good
enough and that a much better service could be provided.  Yorkshire
suggested a range of possible schedules to the operators, with varying
quantities of original, UK-produced and bought-in programmes.  Hum
(Hindi for ``all of us'' or ``mine'') would show films, factual
programmes, soaps, children's programmes and music.

The channel is a good example of local or ethnic programming which
cable is well-suited to provide.  Narrowcasting and regionalism will be
important weapons in cable's battle against BSkyB, according to Robin
Williamson, executive director of US West.  As part of this, the
operators will have to build links with the UK independent production
community, which at the moment relies on ITV and Channel Four for most
of its business.

However, the new economics of the ITV sector are changing.  Independent
companies are having to find new markets for their product as the ITV
market consolidates, and Williamson suggests that cable operators may
invest directly in the companies and their facilities.  Direct co-
operation with the production arms of the ITV companies themselves is
also a possibility.

Senior ITV executives such as Ted Childs, head of drama at Central
Television, and Jonathan Powell, heads of drama at Carlton, point out
that the trend in ITV is towards a separation of production from the
business of running a channel.  Stand-alone production subsidiaries
have been created at all the ITV companies, and these subsidiaries are
being encouraged to mould themselves as separate profit centres.

This pushes them towards taking in partners, such as international
partners, BSkyB or the cable companies.  Programmes, Childs and Powell
say, could be produced by the production ``arms'' and never get shown
on the ITV network.

One of the toughest areas facing the cable operators is the provision
of feature films, given BSkyB's virtual monopoly of pay-television
rights to Hollywood films for the foreseeable future.

That has left the pay-per-view rights to go for, with the operators
leaving the job to the London Interconnect group of operators, which
wants to launch a film ppv service this spring over the system linking
their networks.  Most of the operators own systems across the country,
so a national roll-out would start, hopefully, towards the end of the
year, using digital compression on a satellite transponder provided by
TCI.

The Interconnect group consists of TeleWest (comprising TCI and US
West, both members of CCP1), Nynex and Comcast (also members of CCP1),
General Cable (CPP2), Videotron and Encom (run by Bell Canada).

Hollywood has stymied a spring launch, the operators' second attempt to
get a film service going.  According to one Interconnect executive, the
film studios are uncertain of the merits of pay-per-view, given its
disappointing performance in the USA.

The London operators say that talks are ``ongoing'' and they still hope
to reach agreement.  Some cable executives believe, however, that the
studios have not seriously put the ppv rights ``in play''.  According
to Williamson, US West, the largest single shareholder in Time Warner,
will be given the opportunity to join any bidding for Warner Bros ppv
rights.

Williamson believes that the UK could ``probably sustain a number of
movie channels''.  The top films will be hard to get.  But there are
alternatives.  Film distribution company, Odyssey Film Distributors,
for instance, is planning its own cable-exclusive channel, drawing on a
library of mini-series, US made-for-television product and B movies.
CPP could also conceivably strike deals with other independent
distributors.

ONLY CABLE ACCEPTS SOARING VALUE OF CRICKET CUP

The cable operators' #7.5 million acquisition of rights to the 1996
Cricket World Cup took the terrestrial broadcasters and British Sky
Broadcasting by surprise.  The cable operators were for the first time
bidding for major sports rights -- and were prepared to go far higher
than the rest of the players.

The players -- the cable operators' Cable Programme Partners 1, British
Sky Broadcasting, Channel Four and the BBC -- did not formally bid.
Instead, WorldTel, which owned the rights, told them that it valued the
rights at #7.5 million.  Only the cable operators said they were
willing to pay that price.

BSkyB had paid #1 million for the 1992 cup.  Four years earlier the BBC
had paid #150,000.  So did the operators pay too much?  That will not
be clear for some time, though they did buy more rights than BSkyB and
BBC had bought for the earlier competitions.

The operators are taking all UK rights, including those for all forms
of live and delayed terrestrial, microwave, DTH and cable transmission
and for all video, radio and advertising.  They could sell many of
these on to terrestrial broadcasters, particularly those for delayed
television transmission and radio.

Mark Mascarenhas, president of WorldTel, says that his valuation was in
line with the growing cost of sports events worldwide.  A one-day
cricket international, he argues, has 71 minutes of advertising slots
within it and should be priced accordingly.

BSkyB was surprised by the valuation, even though it has been as
responsible as anybody for lifting the price of rights in recent years,
accepting that they had been undervalued.  The low values were to a
large extent the result of the main customer being the BBC, which does
not carry advertising.

ITV then started competing more fiercely and BSkyB came on to the
scene, with Murdoch showing ``genius'' in understanding the need for a
higher valuation and winning several high-profile events.  At the same
time, sports governing bodies grew more adept at valuing their own
product and television revenues became more important to the sports
themselves.

No one is suggesting that Murdoch is taking a more cautious line.
Recently, he paid #1 billion for the rights to North American football
games for his Fox television network, taking them away from CBS.

MEDIA BODIES COULD FORCE KIRCH TO CUT PRO 7 STAKE

A group of German state media authorities is threatening to force the
Kirch family to sell part of its stake in film-based television channel
Pro 7, on the grounds that the holding may be in breach of German rules
on the concentration of ownership in the new-media sector.

Fourteen out of the 15 authorities have told Pro 7 -- which is 47.5-per-
cent owned by Thomas Kirch, son of media magnate Leo Kirch -- that it
must provide details of its finances to prove that it is independent.
They say that the information must be supplied by the end of this
month.  Pro 7 has so far refused to comply.

The group of authorities -- which includes all except the media
authority of Schleswig-Holstein, the authority which actually granted
Pro 7 its licence to broadcast -- dispute the channel's claim that the
Thomas Kirch shareholding is entirely independent of Leo Kirch's
control.  They argue that it should be treated as part of the Leo Kirch
empire which includes stakes in the general-entertainment channel Sat
1, the pay-television channel Premiere and the sports channel DSF.

They say that the Kirch holding in Pro 7 should thus be no more than 25
per cent -- the maximum level that would be allowed if the stake were
held by Leo Kirch directly.

The group of authorities say that if the channel refuses to co-operate
they will put pressure on Schleswig-Holstein to strip the channel of
its licence.  Schleswig-Holstein has up to now supported the channel,
but could find it difficult to maintain this position if it is opposed
by everybody else.

The 14 authorities have told Pro 7 to submit financial information on
three specific points which they believe will resolve the question of
Pro 7's independence.  But Pro 7 says that it will not supply the
information on the grounds that it is ``commercially sensitive.''

First, the authorities want Pro 7 to supply details of the financial
circumstances surrounding Thomas Kirch's original 1988 investment in
the channel's predecessor, Eureka TV.  The authorities say that there
is no indication as to where Thomas Kirch could have raised the money
other than from his father.

Second, the authorities require information about the arrangements that
the channel made with its banks to cover its debt in the years
following its relaunch as Pro 7 in January 1989.  They suspect that Pro
7's bank loans were guaranteed by Leo Kirch.

Third, the authorities want details of the film-supply deals which Pro
7 has with companies owned by Leo Kirch.  The authorities believe that
Pro 7 has been given preferential terms which involve it being allowed
to delay payment for films, and also to pay for films on an individual
basis.

They say that if the required information is not supplied by the
beginning of April, they will seek to persuade Schleswig-Holstein to
rescind Pro 7's licence immediately.

If Pro 7 does comply with the request, but the information does not
demonstrate that the channel is independent, the authorities will
demand that Thomas Kirch should reduce his share in the channel below
25 per cent within one year -- with the threat of licence removal if he
does not comply.

George Kofler, chief executive of Pro 7 and a minority shareholder,
says that the channel will not comply with the authorities' requests,
which he claims are part of a political campaign against the channel,
resulting from the Kirch family's affiliation with the right-wing CSU
party.

Kofler says that he has shown all the cited documents to the media
authority of Schleswig-Holstein and that circulating the documents to
the other 14 authorities could lead to leakage of sensitive commercial
information on issues such as programme-supply contracts.

He says that the director of the Schleswig-Holstein media authority,
Gernot Schumann, was satisfied with the information, and so the o0her
authorities should allow Pro 7 to continue without further
interference.  He does not believe that Schumann will order any action
against Pro 7.

Kofler argues that Thomas Kirch's original acquisition of a stake in
the channel did not cost that much because it was made at a time when
Eureka TV was effectively a ``bankrupt station.''  He adds that the
channel's backers have not had to put in any more money since then
because investment has been financed by bank loans and by ploughing
back into the company any surplus from advertising, which has grown
steadily as Pro 7 has grown into the third most popular private channel
in Germany after RTL-tv and Sat 1.

A total of DM150 million was invested for the relaunch, since when
advertising revenues have climbed steadily, growing from DM11 million
in 1989 to DM45 million in 1990, DM165 million in 1991 and DM400
million in 1992.  The channel is thought to have taken DM600 million in
1993 and is projected to take DM650 million in 1994.

Kofler adds that Pro 7's banking arrangements have satisfied Schleswig-
Holstein's financial experts -- despite the suspicions of the other
authorities about the involvement of Leo Kirch.

On the specific question of programme acquisition, he says that Pro 7
buys its material on the same terms as every other channel.

The media authorities deny that their action has a political nature.
They say that Pro 7 must convince them all of its independence -- not
just Schleswig-Holstein.  They say that the burden of proof rests with
Pro 7, and that if the channel cannot prove its independence, then it
will be treated on the same basis as it would be if it were 47.5-per-
cent-owned by Leo Kirch himself.

Schumann argues that this is the wrong approach.  He believes that the
burden of proof on disputed questions of media ownership rests with the
media authorities.  Since they cannot prove Pro 7's connection with Leo
Kirch, he says, they should leave the channel alone.

Leo Kirch's shareholdings in German television comprise: 43 per cent in
the full-service general-entertainment channel, Sat 1; 25 per cent in
the thematic pay channel Premiere; and 24.5 per cent in the thematic
sports channel DSF.

Other cases: The media authorities have been considering several cases
where there have been worries about concentration of ownership, but
have decided to take no further action beyond that which is in process
already.

RTL2, which has in the past been a source of concern to the authorities
on the grounds that the coupling of CLT and Bertelsmann amongst the
shareholders matched the position in RTL-tv, is no longer seen as a
problem because the authorities accept that the two companies are not
working in concert in either case.

Other ownership questions, such as that of Bertelsmann's share of Vox
(Satellite TV Finance 4:13), are already being addressed separately.

CHANNELS WANT CHANGES TO OWNERSHIP RULES

Private television companies in Germany are calling for changes in the
law on the ownership of cable and satellite channels to ease the
introduction of new channels based on digital compression.  They say
that the number of new channels will be greatly reduced unless the
regulations are changed.

The programme-providers want changes to the rules limiting the number
of themed channels they are allowed to own.  They say that the present
rules, which impose severe limits, will result in too many new channels
being owned by smaller or new-to-television companies, which are less
likely to have the expertise to operate successful themed channels.

The existing rules, they say, will also encourage foreign companies to
beam channels into Germany, for instance from the UK or Luxembourg, to
take advantage of unfulfilled opportunities.  Digital compression is
likely to be introduced in two to three years.

Dr Peter Luke, head of the legal department at Sat 1, which is keen on
the changes, said that the company does not have specific plans for
themed channels but wants the law changed for the good of the German
television industry.

The Verband Privater Rundfunk Telekommunikation, which represents the
private channels, is also worried about the existing rules on political
balance in themed channels.  It accepts that ``full-service'' channels
should have to provide balanced coverage of news and current affairs,
but that it should be unnecessary for themed channels: there will be
many, perhaps hundreds of themed channels and political balance will be
achieved across the whole range, taken together.

The programme providers say that themed channels should be exempted
from some of the regulations because they will be so numerous and get
such small audiences -- even now the channels attract less than a two-
per-cent viewing share each compared with more than 10 per cent for the
most popular ``full-service'' channels, and because they cover single
issues, such as particular sports or types of music or hobbies, where
it could be unreasonable to expect strict impartiality.

The media authorities are sceptical about changing the regulations.
Lothar Jene, deputy director of the Hamburg media authority, said that
relaxing or removing the regulations could lead to channels defining
themselves as themed channels but still broadcasting general-
entertainment programming.  He thought that the media authorities would
be unlikely to deregulate the channels.  Joachim Becker, deputy
director of the Hessen media authority, also thought that a change in
the law was unlikely.

Ingebord Ludwig, a legal adviser at the Berlin-Brandenburg authority,
was more encouraging.  She said that the likely proliferation of
channels could lead to a relaxation because it would not be sensible to
restrict very small channels.

The present law lays down that a company may own more than 25 per cent
of only one full-service channel (that is, one which shows a range of
programming) and up to 25 per cent of as many as it likes.  It can also
own more than 25 per cent of one themed channel and, again, up to 25
per cent of as many as it likes.

A company which does not own a full-service channel can own more than
25 per cent of two themed channels and up to 25 per cent of as many
others as it likes.  Themed news channels are restricted as if they
were full-service channels.

MTV MAY BE ONLY MEMBER OF SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGE

MTV Europe, the satellite pop-music channel, may be the only member of
an encrypted subscription package to Astra dish homes launched in
Germany this autumn.  Other UK channels which have been hoping to join
the Selco marketing package, set up by the Kirch family's Pro 7 and
Rupert Murdoch's News Datacom, are unlikely to have sorted out rights
problems in time to join the package at launch.

Selco believes that MTV, encrypted in News Datacom's Videocrypt system,
will attract between 200,000 and 300,000 subscribers over two years --
compared with the present Astra dish market in Germany of 4.5 million.
So MTV would lose the bulk of its German dish market -- and possibly
some advertising revenue -- for the sake of a relatively small amount of
subscription revenue.

The move, part of a German-wide and European-wide switch to encryption
for the channel, is an ambitious one, given its present German market,
and flies in the face of the accepted wisdom for pay-channels to stick
together in numbers.  MTV refused to comment.  However, German
television executives believe that MTV's strength in the German market
gives the channel a better chance than most of making a stand-alone
subscription offer work.

Astra dish owners in Germany will initially have to pay a monthly
subscription of between DM5 and DM10 to receive MTV -- on top of buying
a videocrypt decoder costing between DM200 (#79) and DM300.  When other
channels join Selco, MTV could be sold as part of the package, which is
what Selco would prefer, or as a stand-alone service attached to the
main package.

The channel has already reached an agreement with Deutsche Telekom in
which it will receive a fee for distribution to the company's near-14
million cable subscribers -- in return for the channel continuing to be
distributed in the clear.  MTV will continue to pay Deutsche Telekom
about DM1 million a year for the downlinking of the channel signal, but
will now end up slightly in the black.  The channel is seeking a
similar deal with the private cable operators.

In the UK, the channel is set to encrypt and join the Sky Multi-
Channels package this autumn.  It is also talking to Filmnet about
inclusion in its MultiChoice Kaleidoscope mini-pay package sold in
Benelux and Scandinavia and due to be extended to Hungary, the Czech
Republic and Portugal.  Further talks are taking place with cable
operators in several European countries.

Selco was due to launch a package of four to six encrypted English-
language Astra channels to DTH homes in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland this April, but put back the launch because of their
difficulty in clearing German-market rights.  It will provide
subscription-management services such as billing, smartcard
distribution, and customer support.

MTV will retain control over the subscription fee, at least while it is
the only channel in the package.  It is unlikely to have little left
after paying Selco's costs, but the terms of the deal are still being
negotiated.

The channel is calling for what amounts to a larger fee-per-subscriber
from Germany's private cable systems than it got from Deutsche Telekom:
30 pfennigs a month against a likely 0.7 pfennigs.  It has told the
private operators association Anga that, if it is unable to reach
agreement with the association and individual operators seek a deal
after encryption, the charge will double.  An Anga source said that,
despite MTV's huge popularity in Germany, some operators may be
prepared to make do with Viva, the rival music channel launched in
December.

CAN CANAL PLUS AFFORD TO KEEP OUT OF PPV?

The approaching launch of a pay-per-view service on Paris cable
networks has raised the question of whether Canal Plus will seek to
retain its dominance in French pay-television by launching its own pay-
per-view service.

The channel says that it will not, that the market and the technology
is not ready for it.  It will, instead, wait for digital compression
and launch a near-video-on-demand service in two or three years time.
But observers question whether (1) the company can afford to let a
rival service develop and (2) whether political factors, once again at
the centre of French media, will dictate a change in policy.

The cable ppv service, founded by Lyonnaise Communications and France
Telecom, was always seen as a commercial rival to Canal Plus and as an
attempt to pre-empt Canal Plus from introducing its own ppv service.
Now that Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and TF1 have jumped
on board, the service looks to be an even stronger threat to Canal
Plus.

CLT has made no secret of its wish to break Canal Plus' monopoly of pay-
television.  But what if, as some observers suggest, in the wake of the
shareholding and personnel changes at Canal Plus, CLT were to become
more closely allied with the pay-television operator?  Would the two
groups want to come together?  If not, would it make commercial sense
for Canal Plus to carry on waiting for the market to mature?

Even within the present media environment, without any further major
changes, Canal Plus and its shareholders will face a dilemma when,
later this year, the Paris ppv service begins to be rolled out across
the country.  Compagnie Generale des Eaux, thought now to be a very
powerful force within Canal Plus, will have to decide whether to take
the ppv service on its cable networks, the most extensive in the
country.

Several analysts believe that it will not; that, whatever technical or
programming reasons CGE gives, it will not be prepared, as a major
Canal Plus shareholder, to take a service from a rival group of
companies.  But it may have difficulty simply watching from the
sidelines.  As one senior CGE executive put it, ``although politically
the company might not wish to get into bed with [the Paris group], it
has to run its systems profitably.  It will obviously be under pressure
to take it.''  The service, he said, would be taken if it were likely
to be popular.

Some analysts believe that CGE and Canal Plus, which is being forced by
the government to get more involved in cable, could launch its own
joint service.  If the rival service were popular, Canal Plus and CGE
would find it difficult to wait.

For the moment, Canal Plus argues that the French market is not well-
enough developed for ppv to be successful.  The cable service will not
be profitable, it says, because the US studios are unlikely to be
interested until there are one million subscribers -- French cable as a
whole has only 870,000 broadband subscribers -- and the cable group has
enough power to negotiate good film rights.

It says that US experience suggests that a wide choice of programmes
needs to be offered at frequent intervals.  So, it says, it is much
better to wait two or three years until digital compression creates the
capacity to provide a near-video-on-demand service.  Viewers need to be
offered a choice of films -- between four and 10 -- with the possibility
of choosing any of the films every 15 to 30 minutes.

STAR RETHINKS PAY-TV AFTER WHARF BREAKDOWN

Star TV, the pan-Asian satellite broadcaster controlled by Rupert
Murdoch, is to suspend its four premium pay-television services,
following this week's breakdown of negotiations with Wharf Cable in
Hong Kong over carriage terms.

Star says that it is to re-examine the channels -- all of which were
devised initially for relay on Wharf, but were also intended for
subsequent broadcast across Asia via satellite -- and that it could
amend some of them or abandon them altogether.  But it adds that it
still wants to launch pay channels in some form.

The Star move has come as a shock to the Asian News and Business
Channel, the pay channel specially commissioned by Star from NBC, FTTV
and Reuters TV.  The partners in ANBC, which had been hoping to use
Wharf as a base from which to launch the service in other Asian
markets, will meet in the next two weeks to discuss whether the channel
should continue, and if so how.

The other three pay services -- two film channels and a children's
channel -- were all produced by Star itself.

This week's breakdown of discussions between Wharf and Star followed a
long-running dispute between the two, part of which concerned Wharf's
carriage of the four pay channels.  Star has been sending these to
Wharf by landline since the launch of the latter's cable service last
October.

Under the terms of its Hong Kong government licence, Wharf is obliged
to carry ``regional'' premium pay channels from Star.  But it had been
refusing to distribute the four existing channels on the grounds that
they did not qualify as regional until they were transmitted by
satellite (NMM 11:22).

Star and Wharf had reached an outline arrangement for the carriage of
the pay channels -- and for three of the five clear channels that Star
is transmitting via Asiasat 1 -- as part of a wide-ranging contract that
was agreed in June 1993.  However, reaching a final and detailed
agreement became difficult after Murdoch's News Corporation purchased a
controlling stake in Star in July.

The discussions on the outline agreement broke down in January this
year when Wharf Cable began legal action to prove that the agreement
was not legally binding.  In advance of this case being heard in the
high court in Hong Kong, the two sides had begun discussions on a
completely new agreement.

However, Star now says that it cannot reach a ``workable arrangement''
with Wharf and has withdrawn from discussions, at least temporarily.
Wharf says that Star's move reflects its recognition that last June's
outline agreement is not legally binding.

But if Star is to launch new premium pay-television channels from
Asiasat 1 satellite -- as it says it will -- the two sides will have to
negotiate carriage terms or seek involvement of the Hong Kong
government in brokering a carriage deal.  Star's right to have Wharf
carry the premium pay-channels lasts three years and expires in June
1996.

Wharf believes that it can still reach an agreement with Star for the
carriage of premium and clear services.  A well-placed source said:
``We were talking until last week, we have no idea why they have
stopped talking, or what they want to do''.

Meanwhile, Wharf is seeking other arrangements for the supply of
channels to compensate for the loss of Star's clear services (Satellite
TV Finance 5:2).

Star has yet to decide a distribution strategy for the launch of its
premium pay services.  Its original plan was to use its spare
transponder on Asiasat 1 to broadcast the four channels using digital
compression.  It is understood that the plan was blocked by Murdoch,
who has bought a house in Hong Kong to spend time working directly on
Star TV.

BBC PREPARES FOR LAUNCH OF OVERSEAS THEME CHANNELS

The BBC's World Service Television this week put a little bit more
flesh on its plans to launch satellite channels around the world.  It
said that it is ``very seriously'' examining the idea of launching
themed channels of BBC product as well as news and information channels
in the near future.

The themed channels, consisting primarily of BBC product, would be
entire channels dedicated to a certain area, such as documentary or
comedy, or a group of ``strands'' branded as a single channel,
covering, for instance, wildlife, drama and music.

The channels, suggested by Bob Phillis, the BBC's deputy director
general, at a Financial Times conference last month, would be clustered
around WSTV's News and Information Channel, versions of which the BBC
hopes to launch in Europe and the USA this year.

Chris Irwin, WSTV chief executive, said this week that quality will be
of prime importance in the development of new channels because of the
importance of maintaining the BBC's reputation and brand worldwide.

The BBC increasingly sees its reputation as a marketable commodity,
since it gives both the BBC and its partners a head-start in new
markets.  Irwin argues that the BBC is more attractive to potential
distribution partners because of this head-start; the power of the
BBC's reputation is such that it can be expressed as a form of
investment in itself.

The reputation will be even more important in the multi-channel future.
 Irwin sees it developing as a kind of ``publisher's imprint'' -- a
recognisable name in what is likely to be a confusingly varied myriad
of channels.

Increasingly, it is the policy of the BBC to ``manage'' its brand-name,
to nurture it as a market commodity.  This lies behind much of the
BBC's strategy at home and abroad, and has distinct implications for
WSTV's new services.

For instance, the brand-name of the BBC is one factor in the type of
News and Information Channel it will launch in Europe and the USA; the
other factor is that the market for new channels in both territories is
limited.

In both the USA and Europe, the BBC will aim for a very defined (and
closely researched) market.  It is not seeking to compete directly with
what is already available, both for reasons of market share and because
the perceived quality and tone of BBC news provision would not be
appropriate for this kind of head-on competition with the likes of CNN;
it would require a major change in emphasis, and a consequent major
shift of how the BBC's brand is perceived in those territories.
Likewise, the BBC will not seek to compete with the domestic news
services of Europe.

Irwin says that WSTV has identified a significant minority in Europe
and the USA, primarily among AB social groups, with an international
outlook and an interest in an alternative news source.  The minority is
mainly to be found among the academic, media and business sectors.  The
new services will be adapted from the existing News and Information
Channel specifically for this audience.

Irwin uses the analogy of The Economist to explain BBC strategy in the
two markets: to develop and consolidate a niche among the most
influential and powerful social strata, without competing directly with
existing media.

WSTV is also pouring more money into developing its own news-gathering
service, distinct from the domestic service.  Most of its news is still
either commissioned from news agencies or adapted from domestic service
bulletins, but the proportion of news produced directly by WSTV is
increasing and Irwin would like to see this continue.

WSTV is now in the middle of a training programme designed to provide
BBC World Service Radio's reporters with TV experience; in addition,
the imminent launch of WSTV's Arabia service, to be transmitted in
Arabic, is forcing WSTV to create its own Arabic news-gathering service
which, Irwin maintains, ``will be the best in the world.''

WSTV, which is embroiled in a legal dispute over carriage of its News
and Information Channel on Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, is ``re-gaugeing
the competitive environment'' in Asia.

WSTV said recently that it wanted to maintain the Star relationship as
long as possible, and that constructive talks were taking place between
the two parties.  Two weeks ago, Phillis said that either party could
drop out at the end of 1994, but that he hoped the relationship would
continue.

Irwin now says that ``Star is not the only player in Asia,'' adding
that ``there is a deep and growing concern about any one individual
controlling the global gateways, in other words subscriber management
and services.  Rupert Murdoch is a very strong partner to have, because
of his knowledge of the market, but there are other partners.''

There are a number of options, which could include joining the group of
channels which is setting up in opposition to Star on the Apstar
satellites.  Alternatively, the BBC could go it alone and start
broadcasting from one of the new satellites, Apstar 1 and 2 and Asiasat
2.

HOW BIG IS BSKYB'S BILL FOR BRITISH SCREEN FILMS?

BSkyB would have paid between #262,966 and #279,113 for UK pay-
television rights to the highly successful UK feature The Crying Game,
had its new output agreement with British Screen Finance, the
government-backed film subsidy body, been up and running in 1991/92.
It would also have paid at least #385,687 for Orlando and at least
#413,750 for Damage.

These prices have been calculated on the basis of the payment terms set
out in the deal, signed two weeks ago, which will give BSkyB the UK pay-
television rights to at least 30 British Screen-supported features over
three years.  These terms set out formulae under which the prices of
the rights to each film are calculated according to its production
budget and its cinema box-office takings.

There is a basic price for the main pay-television window, which will
open between 15 months and 18  months after the film's theatrical
release, last for between 11 and 12 months, and provide for 12
screenings.  This price includes two elements: an initial licence fee
equivalent to eight per cent of the production budget up to #2.5
million, and three per cent of the sum by which the budget exceeds #2.5
million; and an additional licence fee, equivalent to five per cent of
total box-office receipts (excluding VAT) in the UK and the Irish
Republic up to the point where the film passes to BSkyB.

There is an additional price for an optional second pay-television
window, which will open three years after a film's first broadcast on
free television.  This price is equivalent to five per cent of the
initial licence fee plus 10 per cent of the additional licence fee.

The Crying Game, which in world market terms is the most successful
film ever backed by British Screen, was made on a budget of #2.6
million.  So the initial licence fee would have been #203,000.  The
film has so far taken #1,453,726 at UK and Irish cinemas, according to
its distributors Mayfair, yielding a VAT-exclusive figure of
#1,199,324.  So the additional licence fee would have been #59,966.

Had BSkyB opted to buy a second pay-television window -- highly likely
given the international success of the feature, which earned director
Neil Jordan an Oscar for best original screenplay, and picked up three
other Oscar nominations -- it would have paid an additional #16,147.

The terms of the deal set a cap of #325,000 on the initial licence fee
that BSkyB will have to pay for any individual film in the first year
of the deal's operation.

It would not have had to pay this for any of the films shown here --
although it would have come close with both Orlando and Damage (each of
which had a budget of #6.6 million), where the initial fee would have
been #323,000 in each case.

In each case BSkyB's investment is substantially lower than the price
it was asked to pay in an earlier attempt to open up a pay-television
window for UK features.

Just over a year ago David Elstein, BSkyB's head of programming,
approached Channel Four with a bid to buy UK pay-television rights to a
package of features -- including The Crying Game -- in which the
terrestrial broadcaster had invested in return for equity and all
television rights in line with its normal practice.

But the terrestrial broadcaster effectively rejected the offer, saying
that BSkyB that would have to offer at least twice Channel Four's
initial licence fee -- believed to have been between #300,000 and
#500,000 in each case -- before such a bid would even be considered
(Satellite TV Finance 4:3).

Of the other examples shown, both No Worries and Blue Black Permanent
would have been excluded from the deal as currently constituted.  The
first because it has no theatrical distribution deal and the second
because its budget is below the #750,000 minimum stipulated in the
agreement.

ITC SUGGESTS CHANGES TO RULES ON CROSS-OWNERSHIP OF TV CHANNELS

The Independent Television Commission told Peter Brooke, National
Heritage secretary, who is reviewing cross-media ownership regulations,
that the restriction on a company owning more than two ITV franchise
licences should be replaced by a market-share limit of 25 per cent of
total television advertising revenue, including that of satellite and
cable television.  It also said that cross-media ownership rules could
be applied to satellite channels as satellite viewing increases.

The ITC said that newspaper groups should be able to have 30-per-cent
stakes in ITV companies, instead of the present 20-per-cent limit, and
that ITV companies should be able to have a 30-per-cent stake in the
planned Channel 5 instead of 20 per cent.  It criticised a rule which
limits ITV companies to a holding of less than 50 per cent of
Independent Television News.

DIVORCED TCI LOOKS TO BLOCKBUSTER

TeleCommunications Inc, fresh from the collapse of its merger with Bell
Atlantic, approached the Blockbuster video-rental company about
investing in it or becoming a partner if the company is not merged with
Viacom, as agreed during Viacom's bid for Paramount Communications.

TCI and Bell Atlantic blamed the collapse of their merger on the
Federal Communication Commission's cut of seven per cent in cable
rates.  However, both companies had already been arguing about the
price: this was aggravated by the decline in Bell Atlantic's share
price, which lowered the value of its offer.
