<P>
 Before signing up, we encourage you to read the information presented below to understand how the Mountain Forum operates. Membership in the Mountain Forum is free of charge.

Participation in the Mountain Forum
(Activities and How to become involved)
</H3>
<P>
Through improved communications and information exchange, the
Mountain Forum will empower and enrich all members; create and
strengthen mechanism for critical dialogue; exchange both
successful and unsuccessful experiences; provide a forum for
discussing emerging tools and technologies and their
applications; exchange lessons on monitoring, evaluating and
assessing impacts; and assist members in influencing regional
mountain agendas at the local, national and intergovernmental
levels.  The following activities are some examples of how
Mountain Forum members can actively foster mutual support:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>    Share knowledge, information, experiences with the mountain
     community and interested parties, via the Information Server
     Node (ISN) and regional networks.
<P>
<LI>    Suggest and direct sources of information (documents,
     reports, materials) useful or relevant to the global
     mountain community.  Alternatively, one may make requests
     for support, advice or information to Mountain Forum
     constituents.
<P>
<LI>    Support and respond to inquiries and requests made by other
     Mountain Forum participants.   Support would include the
     sharing of relevant data and information on focused topics,
     or in response to other participants' research and
     activities.
<P>
<LI>    Assume personal responsibility for the dissemination of
     relevant and important information to Mountain Forum
     participants without Internet access.  This responsibility
     likewise extends to the inclusion of input from participants
     without access to the Internet.
<P>
<LI>    Identify potential participants and members and involve them
     in Mountain Forum activities.
<P>
<LI>    Work with other members to form alliances, partnerships and
     joint research activities at the local, regional, and global
     levels.
   </UL>    <P>
Mountain Forum participants are encouraged to promote and
raise the awareness of mountain issues at local, national,
regional and global levels.  Successful advocacy should result in raising
mountain issues on the agendas of national decision makers, donor
agencies and international organizations.  Specific actions that
participants can initiate relevant to advocacy include but are
not limited to:
<P><UL>
<LI>    facilitating dialogue and improved communications between
     mountain communities and national decision makers;
<P>
<LI>    convening local, national and regional workshops and task
     forces around relevant mountain issues; 
<P>
<LI>    informing national decision makers via these workshops,
     briefings and media coverage;
<P>
<LI>    encouraging the formation of a mountain lobby which involves
     stakeholders and decision makers;
<P>
<LI>    contributing directly to the review and implementation of
     UNCED document Agenda 21, Chapter 13 "Managing Fragile
     Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain Development".
