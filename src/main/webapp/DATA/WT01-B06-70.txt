The Passive Approach to Investing Via Index Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

Index funds are passively run portfolios that target specific market benchmarks, such as the S&P 500. Why have they become so popular with investors?<P>


Probably the main reason is that more investors have learned that it's difficult to select long-run winners. Index funds provide an alternative to dependence on an active manager's investment style, which may underperform the market, and which comes at a higher cost.<P>


Before investing in an index fund, you should see how well it has tracked its target index. This is difficult to do with some of the newer index funds, but you should at least be able to make some inferences as to how well it will track the benchmark in the future. Not all index funds track their benchmarks that closely.<P>


True index funds exhibit predictable performance, are always fully invested, have low expense ratios and low portfolio turnover rates and, as a consequence, are tax efficient.<P>


The difference between the performance of an index fund and the index itself is due to two factors: whether the fund takes the whole universe of the index or a sample, and the fund's expense ratio. Some indexes, such as the Wilshire 5000 include over 6,800 firms, so a fund would invest in a sampling of, say, 1,700 stocks from the index. The higher the expense ratio, the greater the degree to which a fund trails its benchmark.<P>


Today's index funds offer a broad array of choices. The first consideration you face in selecting index funds is to select the index you want to track.<P>


Big-cap stock index funds generally target the S&P 500 index. Broad market index funds might target the Wilshire 5000 index, while mid-sized index funds may track the S&P MidCap 400 index or the Wilshire 4500 index. Small-stock index funds might track the Russell 2000 index.<P>


You will also find index funds that concentrate on a particular industry, as well as index funds that focus on the international market or the bond market. Finally, there are  tax-efficient portfolios, which try to control their capital gains a little more than a regular index fund by giving their managers more leeway.<P>


There are three alternate routes you can take in building your mutual fund portfolio.<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>All Passive.</STRONG> It's not difficult to build a balanced, global mutual fund portfolio consisting exclusively of index funds. Good index funds can be bought and held for decades with the assurance that you will be doing better than the majority of actively managed portfolios. However, you forego the opportunity of selecting some top performers.<P>


<LI><STRONG>An Indexed Core.</STRONG> The core approach--which is popular with large pension funds--offers a nice compromise. Broadly diversified index funds are useful as core holdings amounting to anywhere from 30% to 50% or more of a portfolio. Using the core as a base, you would add actively managed funds that you feel could beat the market or provide some other unique advantage, such as the tax-free income of a single-state municipal bond portfolio. One investor may choose to maintain a position in a Wilshire 5000 portfolio as a permanent part of his asset mix. Another individual with a larger portfolio may decide to include three index funds in her core: an S&P 500 portfolio, a small-cap fund, and an international fund.<P>


<LI><STRONG>All Active.</STRONG> Perhaps the index concept bores you. And, of course, there may be opportunities for astute fund managers to add value in relatively inefficient sectors of the market, such as small domestic and foreign stocks. However, if you choose the all-active route, be sure you don't inadvertently engage in "closet" indexing. This refers to the situation that may occur if you hold, say, several large-cap funds--representing both growth and value styles--that, when viewed as a whole, perform like an index fund. The disadvantage here is the higher expenses of actively managed funds. To avoid closet indexing consider replacing these large-cap funds with an S&P 500 portfolio.<P>
</UL>

Here are some points to keep in mind if you're shopping for index funds and building them into your asset mix.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Examine the expense ratio. With the exception of the international portfolios, it's best to stick with index funds that have expense ratios below 0.5%--otherwise you're not gaining the main advantage of indexing. If expenses are capped temporarily by a fee waiver, don't be caught by surprise when it expires.<P>


<LI>If you're planning to invest the minimum, be aware of the consequences of any fixed account maintenance fees. Some funds charge a $10 annual account maintenance fee. <P>


<LI>Examine the portfolio turnover. True, passive index funds have turnover rates of 5% to 10% or less. However, the composition of some benchmarks--in particular bond indexes--frequently changes and higher turnovers are normal as the manager adjusts the make-up of the fund to that changing composition. <P>


<LI>Take note of redemption fees and switching limitations. Make sure there is not a conflict between these restrictions and your time frame. Index funds are not recommended for in-and-out traders.<P>


<LI>The magnitude of the ratio of net investment income to average assets (which is found in the "financial highlights" table in the prospectus) is an important determinant of the tax efficiency of any fund, including indexed portfolios. This ratio would be lower for a small-stock portfolio than an S&P 500 portfolio, making the former more tax-efficient than the latter, all else equal.<P>


<LI>In general, if you invest in a mix of index and actively-managed funds, index funds are best-suited for your taxable accounts, and your less tax-efficient holdings are better suited for your tax-deferred retirement plans. A tax-managed index fund could be particularly appropriate for a large investor in the highest tax bracket.<P>


<LI>Be wary of "enhanced"  index funds. If you see a portfolio that calls itself an index fund, but does not have all the major characteristics of one, it's probably not true-blue. Some enhanced index funds may strive to beat a particular index by trying to predict which stocks in the benchmark will deliver the best performance and overweight those issues while underweighting or excluding others. If an index fund tries to outperform its benchmark, it can't be a true passive portfolio. Make sure you understand what you're buying.<P>
