<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 228</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>How much would it cost<BR>
to reduce net emissions?<BR>
of greenhouse gases?</H1>
<HR>
<B>Reducing net greenhouse gas emissions significantly will require the diversion of 
resources away from other activities. </B>Money spent on a policy to reduce emissions 
and enhance carbon "sinks" cannot be spent on education, health care, or other 
environmental programmes. Consequently, our economic well-being would be reduced 
(setting aside the benefits of reduced climate change impacts). The cost of a climate 
change policy is defined by economists as the monetary value of this reduction in 
well-being, or as the compensating payment that would be necessary to make society as 
well off with the policy as without it.<P>
<B>A policy for reducing net emissions should achieve its objective at the minimum 
possible cost.</B> To be cost-effective, <A HREF = 
"fs227.html">an abatement policy must be comprehensive</A>, 
reducing not only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions but the emissions of other greenhouse 
gases as well. The reduction of each individual gas must also be achieved at the lowest 
possible cost. For example, CO2 emissions can be reduced by various means: banning the 
use of coal, mandating energy-efficiency standards, imposing petrol taxes, and so on. But 
while each of these policies would reduce emissions, some would do so more efficiently 
than others. Most economists believe that economic instruments such as <A HREF = 
"fs230.html">carbon taxes</A> and <A HREF = 
"fs231.html">tradable emission entitlements</A> would be more 
cost-effective than regulatory policies (fact sheets 230 and 231).<P>
<B>Estimates of how much it would cost to reduce CO2 emissions vary . . .</B> 
There is even disagreement about the cost of reducing current emissions by just one ton. 
Some analysts believe that this cost would be negative because it could be achieved simply 
by getting rid of distortions in energy markets. Others believe that if it were possible to 
reduce energy consumption at a negative cost, it would already have been done. There are 
also differing views about a variety of important variables: how quickly emissions would 
increase in the absence of a climate change policy, what improvements in energy efficiency 
could be expected to occur independently of price changes, how easily fossil fuels can be 
substituted for one another, whether and how other energy sources can be substituted for 
fossil fuels, and the likely availability and cost of new energy technologies that do not emit 
CO2. With all these uncertainties, it is not surprising that there are also different views 
about the long-run costs of cutting net CO2 emissions.<P>
<B>... but economists generally agree that the cost of making rapid or substantial 
reductions in net CO2 emissions would be high.</B> Estimates of the costs vary 
widely. As an example, a 1989 Manne-Richels study indicates that the US would have to 
sacrifice 0.8-4.0% of its GNP by the year 2100 to reduce its CO2 emissions by 77% 
compared to the level that would result from current trends (or by 20% relative to 1985’s 
emission level). For the purpose of comparison, all the environmental regulations adopted 
by the US in the 1970s are together estimated to have reduced US national output by 
about 2.6%.1<P>
<B>The error bounds for such cost estimates are large.</B> Most of the studies so far 
completed on the costs of reducing net emissions assume that the adopted policy would be 
efficient. If this were not the case, costs could be several times higher. On the other hand, 
policies that abate CO2 emissions would also reduce other harmful emissions, and this 
additional benefit is not considered by these studies. Another source of error is the reliance 
on assumptions about future technologies. Important assumptions must also be made 
about the ease of substituting one energy source for another and the possibility of 
price-independent improvements in energy efficiency. An OECD study shows that changes 
in these two assumptions can change the estimated cost by 100 per cent.2<P>
<B>Similar economic principles would also apply to policies for reducing the 
emissions of other greenhouse gases and for enhancing sinks.</B> As with CO2, the 
marginal cost3 of abating CFCs, nitrous oxide, and so on would rise as a higher and higher 
percentage is reduced. The same principle also applies to creating or enhancing sinks for 
absorbing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. For example, policies that remove 
uneconomic incentives for cutting forests without replanting them would reduce 
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide at little or no cost (the cost is thought to 
range from US$2.30 per ton for Brazil to US$15 for Indonesia). Creation of additional 
carbon sinks through <I>re</I>forestation, however, would be much more costly, 
particularly if applied to land that has alternative productive uses; estimates for the US rise 
to over US$45 per ton of absorbed carbon.4<P>
<B>The total cost of reducing emissions will be lower if there is <A HREF = 
"fs232.html">international cooperation.</A></B> Since 
the costs of incremental reductions in emissions increase with the level of abatement, the 
total costs of achieving a particular global target would decline as more and more 
countries commit to reductions. The same OECD study cited above shows that, for the 
industrialized countries, the costs of reducing emissions would be about five times higher 
if they proceed on their own than it would be if there is a global agreement. This higher 
cost would also impose additional indirect costs on non-OECD countries, because 
fuel-exporting countries would lose income and developing countries would lose trade 
opportunities.<P>
<B>For policy-makers, the clear conclusion is that <A HREF = 
"fs233.html">modest efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas 
emissions are economically justified</A>.</B> The foregoing economic analysis 
suggests that small reductions in emissions and small improvements in sinks would not be 
very costly. However, the incremental costs of large reductions in atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases would be large - unless better technologies are 
developed. Given our knowledge of the benefits of such policies, it seems that small 
reductions in emissions and small improvements in sinks would be justified. However, 
these activities should be achieved efficiently using economic instruments, and they should 
be coordinated internationally. Such policies should be supplemented by research into new 
technologies that would help to reduce the costs of reversing man-made climate change in 
the long run.<P>

	3  The marginal cost is the cost of reducing emissions by one additional unit (e.g. a ton). Economists derive marginal 
costs on the assumption that the cheapest options for abatement would be exploited first, followed later by the more 
expensive ones. This results in the marginal cost rising as the level of greenhouse gas abatement increases.<P>
