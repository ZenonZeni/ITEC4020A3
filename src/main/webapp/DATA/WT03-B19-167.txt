<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">
<H2>Availability of labour</H2>
<P>
The data collected by KPMG Management Consulting showed that
the availability of senior management and professionals varied
markedly between cities.
<P>
Respondent companies were asked to rank the availability of staff
in each of the cities relative to Melbourne on a response range
from
minus 3 to plus 3. The results are shown in the table below. A
positive
score indicates that the class of labour is relatively more available
in the other city than Melbourne, whilst a negative score shows
that
the class of labour is more available in Melbourne.
Melbourne ranked highly for the availability of both senior
management and professional staff as shown in the table below.

<h3>&quot;We've got ready access to the research and technology partners
we
need&quot;</h3>
<P><ul>
Ian Gresswell
<br>
Managing Director
<br>
Bonlac Foods Limited
</ul>
<P>
In an $US8.3 million dollar move, Australia's largest dairy producer
Bonlac Foods has closed its processing and packaging operations
in
Sydney and Singapore and consolidated in Melbourne.
<P>
Expansion of the company's Melbourne plants will lift its export
capacity by 15,000 tonnes a year. Bonlac exported product worth
more than $US300 million to over 50 countries last year.
<P>
The consolidation in Melbourne is part of the company's long term
program
of technology upgrading and export expansion as the company
prepares
for the next century. It has recently announced plans to build
a
$US113 million milk powder plant
100 kilometres east of Melbourne to service the export market.
<P>
Bonlac is assembling the best technology in the world in Victoria
to
uncover value-added applications for waste water.
<P>
It has also teamed with the University of Melbourne and others
in
research and development on uses for a protein from casein in
the
protection and repair of teeth and the treatment of osteoporosis.
<P>
As well as it's R&amp;D capacity, Bonlac also cites cost reasons
for the
relocation.  Rising standards of living in Singapore and the depreciation
 of the Australian dollar meant that operating costs are now higher
in
Singapore than in Melbourne.
