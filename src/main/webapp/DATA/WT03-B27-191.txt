TAMPAX TAMPONS - NATURALS

Tambrands, Inc. has reintroduced the concept of a 100% natural, all-cotton
Tampon.  Tampax Naturals are made without viscose rayon, a synthetic
material used in most other tampons.  The launch follows a study last year
by two New York University scientists that suggests the rayon in tampons is
linked to Toxic Shock Syndrome. Tambrands, Inc. denies that this entry is
in response to this study. The company claims the introduction is based
solely on consumer testing.  "Cotton is like baking soda.  People attribute
all sorts of good things to it."  According to trade sources, "Cotton has
tremendous imagery with the consumer for naturalness, purity, cleanliness
and comfort."  CATEGORY: Health & Beauty Aids - Sanitary & Incontinence
