<BR> January 20, 1994<BR>
<BR> TOMS RIVER, NJ - <A HREF="TGCAcji.html">Charles J. Irwin</A>, General
Counsel of Irwin Gaming Consultants, Inc. announced the formation of
<A HREF="TGCA.html">Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc. (TGCA)</A> as
a new resource for the Native American Gaming Industry. Irwin, formerly Vice
Chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission , currently serves as
Chairman of the Chitimacha Tribal Gaming Commission in Louisiana.<BR>
<BR> Motivated to respond to recent allegations that Native American gaming
interests are easy targets for unscrupulous business interests, Irwin has
developed a system of procedures and controls which replicates the protection
common to major gaming jurisdictions.<BR>
<BR> His new firm will assist tribal gaming commissions to meet the challenges
of preserving tribal assets, maintaining gaming integrity, and complying with
state &amp; federal regulations. &quot;The challenge faced by many tribes,&quot;
commented Irwin, &quot;is to establish effective oversight procedures as quickly
as they add or expand gaming operations. TGCAI can be a big help. Our experience
extends from the licensing of vendors &amp; employees; to the development of
Tribal Regulations &amp; Ordinances; the evaluation of procedures for security &amp;
control; and the hiring, training , &amp; supervision of Commission Inspectors.&quot;<BR>
<BR> &quot;Each tribe has its own set of needs,&quot; continued Irwin. TGCAI
will help identify those needs, and then assist the tribe to develop systems and
procedures to meet them.&quot; As Irwin explains it, the usual TGCAI role will
be a short-term one focused on launching effective Gaming Commission operations.
Other services will include Control System Audits, and consulting engagements on
a project basis. TGCAI will also provide experienced gaming professionals to act
as interim Tribal Commission members &amp; staff on an as needed basis.<BR>
<BR> Irwin has served as Chairman of the Chitimacha Gaming Commission since
August of last year. He was appointed to the New Jersey Casino Regulatory
Commission in 1991, and served until April of 1993. Prior to that he was a
member of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. He also served as a
member of the New Jersey Assembly (1968-1971), and as Director of the New Jersey
Division of Consumer Affairs (1971-1973). An attorney since 1960, he has
practiced before both state and federal courts including the US Supreme Court.<BR>
