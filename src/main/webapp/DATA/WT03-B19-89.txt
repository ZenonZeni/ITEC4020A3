<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Disability Activists Take Action on "Right
to Die"</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Not Dead Yet is a recently formed disability civil rights group which
has, in its brief history, received national press coverage for its first
action - a protest at the home of Jack Kevorkian. The group has also managed
to make its voice heard at medical ethics conferences, and the recent AMA
convention. </P>

<P>On Saturday, October 5, the group raised its voice on the internet.
On Saturday, October 5, the group took to a new kind of &quot;street&quot;
- the &quot;information superhighway&quot;. Disability activists from the
U.S. and Canada attempted to educate members of a mailing list operated
by one of the most noted proponents of assisted suicide, Derek Humphry,
who is a founder of the Hemlock Society and author of <U>Final Exit</U>.
</P>

<P>Web sites operated by Humphry and other proponents of assisted suicide
have gained a reputation as rich sources for <I>general</I> information
on issues related to euthanasia, to the extent that even major news services
have been known to cite them as such. </P>

<P>These sites, and the organizations that support them, have managed to
promote the illusion that there is no opposition to their movement from
anyone but religious conservatives. They refuse to recognize the disability
rights resistance to their bigotry regarding our quality of life. As so
often happens, this community is ignored, while stereotypes and fears about
disability are used to further somebody else's agenda. </P>

<P>At approximately 9:30pm EDT, the following message went out to the right_to_die
list, followed by others over the course of the evening and into the morning:
</P>

<P><i>Not Dead Yet! is a group of disability activists who are opposed to
the legalization of assisted suicide. We have invited ourselves to your
forum for a number of reasons: </P>
<dl><dt>
<dd>1. Derek Humphry, owner of this list, and John Hofsess have gained a
reputation as experts on the topics of assisted suicide and euthanasia.


<P><dd>2. Unfortunately, in spite of their reputations and the belief that
the web sites operated by these gentlemen are comprehensive sources of
information on end-of-life issues, materials and news items that reflect
opposition based in the disability community have never been made available
through sites or forums operated by either Humphry or Hofsess. </P>

<P><dd>3. We believe this pattern of omission is intentional. Promoters of
assisted suicide and other related agendas have been successful in presenting
the issue as an argument between the religiously-based &quot;right to life&quot;
movement and advocates of &quot;choice&quot;. There is a third voice in
this debate, an opposition based in a civil rights perspective. In growing
numbers, members of the disability community are alarmed by the stereotypes
and discrimination widespread in the medical community and reflected in
the language and stories used to promote the legalization of the &quot;right&quot;,
putting it bluntly, to be killed. </P>

<P><dd>4. We do not expect to be welcome participants in your ongoing
<b>discussion</b>,
as it is currently framed on this list. Accordingly, we will be posting
materials that will probably be unfamiliar to most of you and then leave.
However, unless we see an acknowledgment of our voice in this debate, as
evidenced by distribution of news stories related to Not Dead Yet! actions
as well as other disability-based materials, we <b>will</b> be back. </i></P>
</dl>
<P>The reaction to the invasion was swift. In a tersely worded email message,
Humphry branded the group as &quot;right to life&quot;, which in the context
of this debate generally refers to elements of the Christian conservative
political movements. </P>

<P>Bob Liston, of Ypsilanti, Michigan, replied, &quot;This is not a 'right
to life' issue-it is a civil rights issue.&quot; Liston, of the Ypsilanti-
based ADAPT group, is the Michigan coordinator for Not Dead Yet. </P>

<P>Liston, in a message to the mailing list, had this to say about the
promoters of assisted suicide: &quot;It is not people who are terminally
ill who are so emphatic about this 'supposed' right. It seems to be people
who are afraid of the thought that they may not be in complete control
of their lives. Guess what folks!!! None of us are.&quot; </P>

<P>Why target the right_to_die listserv? &quot;This list's membership includes
a virtual who's who of figures in the &quot;right to be killed&quot; movement,&quot;
says Stephen Drake of Syracuse, NY. &quot;In the months I've lurked on
the list I have witnessed kneejerk defenses of <i>any </i>parent or spouse who
kills a relative with a disability. A short while ago, John Hofsess (founder
of the Canadian Right to Die Society) called for pro-euthanasia organizations
to contribute to Kevorkian's dream to build a clinic&quot;. </P>

<P>Drake says this appeal from a prominent leader of the movement should
alarm anyone who has actually read Kevorkian's book <U>Prescription: Medicide</U>,
published in 1991. In the book, Kevorkian states that his greatest satisfaction
in his current work is &quot;the prospect of making possible the performance
of invaluable experiments or other beneficial medical acts under conditions
that this first unpleasant step can help establish...&quot;. </P>

<P>Most people have an image of the so-called &quot;right to die&quot;
movement as advocates for eliminating the last few pain-filled days of
someone with a terminal illness. In fact, the movement encompasses advocates
of this &quot;right&quot; for <I>anyone</I> with a chronic illness or disability.
What all players agree on, though, is that it is a practical necessity
to get legislation passed for a narrowly defined population in order to
try to expand this &quot;right&quot; to more and more people through court
challenges. </P>

<P>Several well-known Right to Die cases involved people with disabilities
who despaired when threatened with placement in nursing homes. They could
have lived independently with home. and community- based supports. They
- and 2.4 million other disabled Americans - have been consigned to nursing
homes because in-home supports are so limited. We want to live - in freedom.
</P>

<P>&quot;Please understand. We don't want anyone to suffer,&quot; says
Diane Coleman, a national organizer of Not Dead Yet, &quot;We believe that
disabled people and sick people deserve to have their health care needs
met, including pain management and in-home support services that are often
denied. </P>

<P>&quot;The failings of our health care system are not a justification
for killing. This Right To Die epidemic is based on society's extreme prejudice
against people with disabilities - a prejudice that most of the experts
won't even acknowledge, much less try to overcome. </P>
