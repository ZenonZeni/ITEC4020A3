<h3 align=center>Case Example #1 </h3>
<p align=center>(names and details altered to prevent identification)</p>
<p>Abby Thurmond, age 42, had not had a food binge for over 2 years when she flew from Miami to Chicago to attend the 
wedding of her friend's daughter. Single, independent, and devoted to her work, Abby had just sold her first screenplay. She 
was pleased, but she was also experiencing the &quot;postpartum&quot; letdown that always occurred when she finished a major 
project. </p>
<p>Despite knowing, from 2 years in Overeaters Anonymous (OA), that she needed to keep a safe distance from food, 
especially in emotionally hard times, Abby spent the entire day of the wedding rehearsal party in the company of food. She 
stood in her friend's kitchen for hours cutting, chopping, sorting, arranging, and, eventually, picking at the food. </p>
<p>When night and the guests came, the flurry of activity made it easy for Abby to disappear&#151;physically and 
emotionally&#151;into a binge. She started with a plate of what would have been an &quot;abstinent&quot; meal (an OA concept for 
whatever is included on one's meal plan): pasta salad, green salad, cold cuts, and a roll. Although the portions were 
generous, Abby wanted more. She spent the next 5 hours eating, at first trying to graze among the guests, but then, when 
shame set in, retreating to dark corners of the room to take frantic, stolen bites. </p>
<p>Abby stuffed herself with crackers, cheeses, breads, chicken, turkey, pasta, and salads, but all that was a prelude to what 
she really wanted&#151;sugar. She'd been waiting for the guests to leave the dining room, where the desserts were. When they 
finally did, she cut herself two pieces of cake, then two more, then ate directly from the serving tray, shoveling the food into 
her mouth. She reached for cookies, more cake, and cookies again. Heart racing, terrified of being discovered, Abby finally 
tore herself away and slipped out onto the terrace. </p>
<p>By now, in what she thought of as a &quot;food trance,&quot; Abby piled her plate with bread, onto which she smeared some 
unidentifiable spread. Though the food tasted like mud, Abby kept eating. Soon. other guests came out to the terrace, leaving 
Abby feeling she had to move again, which she did, stepping into the kitchen&#151;and the light. When Abby glanced down at 
her plate, she was horrified; ants were crawling all over it. Instead of reflexively spitting out the food, Abby, overcome by 
shame, could only swallow. Then her eyes began to search the debris on her plate for uncontaminated morsels. Witnessing 
her own madness, Abby began to cry. She flung the plate into the trash and ran to her room. </p>
<p>That event marked the beginning of a 6-month relapse into binge eating&#151;Abby's worst experience with bingeing since the 
problem began 15 years earlier. During the relapse, she binged on sugar foods and refined carbohydrates, returned to 
cigarette smoking to control the bingeing, and once again was driven to &quot;get rid&quot; of the calories by incessant exercise after 
each binge, walking 4 or 5 hours at a time, dragging her bicycle up and down six flights of stairs, and biking miles after 
dark in a dangerous city park. </p>

<h3 align=center>Discussion </h3>
<p>The term <i>eating binge</i> is often used by people to describe occasions on which they eat more food than they should. 
However Abby's description of her eating episode at the wedding rehearsal leaves little doubt that her episodes of binge 
eating, during which she has no control over how much she eats, represent a serious symptom. In diagnosing a person with 
recurrent eating binges, the first question is whether or not that person regularly compensates for the overeating by some 
drastic inappropriate behavior. If the answer is no, the diagnosis is probably Binge-Eating Disorder, a nonofficial 
diagnosis that is included in a DSM-IV appendix of diagnoses requiring further study. If the answer is yes and as is usually 
the case, self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight, the diagnosis is Bulimia Nervosa. Most patients 
with Bulimia Nervosa compensate for the binge eating by some method of purging&#151;either self-induced vomiting (most 
common) or the use of diuretics or laxatives. Abby's disorder is an example of the relatively unusual diagnosis of Bulimia 
Nervosa, Nonpurging Type, in which the patient uses methods such as excessive exercise (Abby's method) or fasting. </p>

<h3 align=center>Follow-up </h3>
<p>Throughout the relapse, Abby went to therapy and to OA. But the bingeing worsened, as did the accompanying isolation and 
depression, which kept her awake, often crying uncontrollably, until the early morning hours. Finally, her therapist, a social 
worker, referred her to a psychiatrist, who put her on an antidepressant that has been used to control binge eating and on a 
structured food plan that excluded refined sugars, breads, crackers, and similar carbohydrates. Within a few weeks, Abby 
was able to stop bingeing, come out of the depression, and resume her life. After 2 years on the medication, no binges, and 
the gradual reintroduction of breads and related carbohydrates into her diet, Abby was able to stop taking the 
antidepressant, without depression or a return to binge eating. She continues to be active in OA. </p>
