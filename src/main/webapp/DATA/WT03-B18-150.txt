<P>1996 has been a very active year for the Oil Pipelines Management Group
(OPMG), partly because DGXI invited CONCAWE to submit evidence to their
study on whether a major accident hazard directive on pipelines was required
and the OECD held a workshop in Oslo on a similar subject.</P>

<P>CONCAWE played an active role in planning the programme, publicising
it amongst the pipeline operators and providing speakers. More than 100
participants attended, representing most of the OECD member countries.
These included representatives from governments, other regulatory authorities,
academia, consultants, pipeline operators and industry organizations. </P>

<P>The CONCAWE presentations covered three main points which were introduced
in an initial overview presentation. These were:</P>

<UL>
<LI>pipelines are an essential element in the transport of petroleum products;</LI>

<LI>oil pipelines in Western Europe are a safe method of transport; and</LI>

<LI>the good safety record has not been achieved by chance, but through
application of rigorous safety management systems (generally called PIMS—<B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>ipeline<B><FONT SIZE=+1>
i</FONT></B>ntegrity <B><FONT SIZE=+1>m</FONT></B>anagement <B><FONT SIZE=+1>s</FONT></B>ystems).</LI>
</UL>

<P>These topics were amplified in further presentations covering:</P>

<UL>
<LI>the results of the collection of incident data by CONCAWE over 25 years;</LI>

<LI>essential elements of a PIMS;</LI>

<LI>leak detection; and</LI>

<LI>measures to stop third-party damage in the Netherlands and France.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>All these presentations were well-received and led to lively discussions.
Indeed, the whole workshop was characterized by the active participation
in discussions by all the participants. Another notable feature was the
general consensus reached between the various groups. </P>

<P>The most important conclusion was that pipelines provide a vital and
safe means of transport for large volumes of potentially hazardous materials.
It was recognized that pipeline operators have compelling reasons for ensuring
the safety of their operations and that they have the primary responsibility
for ensuring this within a framework of regulation. </P>

<P>Another conclusion was that risk assessment was a necessary tool for
decision makers in both industry and government. However, it should be
used for comparing options rather than as a definitive means of decision
making. Risk assessment depends on the availability of reliable statistics.
</P>

<P>It was noteworthy that, although many people collect records of pipeline
incidents, the CONCAWE statistics are almost alone in also containing full
records of the relevant population of pipelines to which the incident data
applies. They are therefore invaluable to all involved in such risk assessments
and were quoted by many independent speakers. The workshop recommended
that more attention should be made to collecting accurate and usable data.
</P>

<P>Finally, the positive benefits of safety management systems were recognized—these
should be an integral part of the overall management of a company. It was
therefore recommended that industry should share its experiences in this
field. This has been one of the major activities of OPMG since its inception.
