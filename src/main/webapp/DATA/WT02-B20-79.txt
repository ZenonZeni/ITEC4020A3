The process of organizing, interpreting and utilizing sensory
information from our touch, movements, sight, sound and other systems,
and from body awareness and the pull of gravity is called sensory
integration. This concept was developed and refined by the research of
the late A. Jean Ayres, PhD, OTR. Sensory integration helps us move
through space (walking, running), react to danger (recoil from a sharp
object or extreme heat), and coordinate the movements of our head,
eyes and hands (lifting our head to read from a black board and then
writing on paper on a desktop.)<P>

  An approach to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders is 
presented that considers the difficulties in relationships and communication 
secondary to sensory and motor processing deficits.  These difficulties are 
conceptualized as Multisystem Developmental Disorder (MSDD), and case vignettes 
illustrate typical patterns of MSDD and intervention options.  (Author/SW)<BR>

  Dealing with Sensory Integrative Dysfunction in the Classroom: A Guide for

  Target Audience: Teachers; Practitioners<BR>
  This paper offers teachers basic information about sensory integration and 
suggests strategies for managing classrooms which include children with sensory 
integrative dysfunction.  The first section looks at what sensory integration 
is, noting especially the roles of the three "near senses": the vestibular 
system, the proprioceptive system, and the tactile system.  Next, sensory 
integrative dysfunction in children is considered, including the hyporesponsive 
child and the hyperresponsive child.  Specific ways that sensory integration 
dysfunction can become a problem in the classroom are considered, including 
problems with peers, with controlling aggression, with motor planning, and with 
maintaining alertness.  Suggestions for classroom management while managing a 
child with sensory integrative dysfunction are offered, including suggestions 
for setting up the classroom, managing instructional time, and being flexible 
in teaching styles.  Teachers are urged to seek the support of colleagues, 
administrators, parents, and providers of support services.  (Contains 21 
references.) (DB)<BR>

  Historical Overview of Nonstandard Treatments.<BR>

  This review of nonstandard treatments as they relate to individuals with 
mental retardation reveals attempts to increase intelligence and make 
individuals "normal." Covering the early 1930s through the present, the review 
addresses: cell therapy, electric shock, behavior modification, vitamin B-6 
therapy, Doman-Delacato treatment, auditory training, sensory integration, the 
Feingold diet, Candida Albicans yeasts, facial screening, Dolphin therapy, 
facilitative communication, and water-misting.  The treatments are grouped 
according to their decade of initial presentation, with major developments 
briefly highlighted to illustrate their significance in special education.  
Issues underlying the arguments of advocates and opponents of the treatments 
are discussed.  The role of studies pertaining to each issue is analyzed, and 
in some cases, the involvement of the U.S. mass media, legislature, and 
judicial system is mentioned.  The following therapies that are professionally 
accepted and promoted by the education system are also briefly reviewed: art, 
music, and dance therapy; equine and pet therapy; recreation and play therapy; 
and physical and occupational therapy.  Appendices include a diagnostic 
checklist for children with behavior disturbances and information on dosages 
and outcomes of studies of high-dose vitamin B6 and magnesium for individuals 
with autism.  (Contains 151 references.) (SW)<BR>

  Nine children participated in one of three groups: children diagnosed as both 
sensory and language impaired, children diagnosed as language impaired, and 
normally developing children matched for language level.  Sensory integration 
activities prior to language intervention resulted in significant changes on 
the Battelle Developmental Inventory for the children diagnosed as both sensory 
and language impaired.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  A study assigned children aged 6-8 with sensory integration (SI) dysfunction 
to 3 groups: 35 used sensory modalities, 32 received psychomotor (PM) training, 
and 13 no intervention.  SI and PM administered one hour per week for six 
months proved equally effective in improving academic and motor performance but 
had little effect on self-esteem.  (SK)<BR>

  This study analyzed the efficacy of sensory integration treatment by 
combining data from a study of 96 Canadian children (29 from Alberta and 67 
from Ontario children and all aged 5-8).  Results indicate that the therapeutic 
effect of sensory integration treatment is not greater than other, more 
traditional methods of intervention.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  After 72 sessions for 3 hours per week, significantly more children aged 5-9 
receiving sensory integration (SI) therapy (n=35) and perceptual motor training 
(n=35) showed improvement in SI functioning compared to 33 receiving no 
treatment.  Similar effects were found for subgroups with vestibular 
dysfunction only (n=11, 13, and 11 respectively).  (Author/SK)<BR>

  A review of research since Ayers' (1972) report on sensory integration (SI) 
concludes that SI is not supported as an effective treatment for academic 
problems of children with learning disabilities.  It is not clear whether SI is 
more effective than perceptual-motor approaches or maturation alone.  (SK)<BR>

  The Developmental Day School, a 4-year-old demonstration school in Phoenix, 
is described.  The curriculum is based on neurodevelopmental, sensory 
integrative principles.  An interdisciplinary staff integrates communication, 
daily living, academic, sensorimotor and music components.  Self-stimulating 
behaviors are handled by analyzing the child's stressors and sensory modalities.

  This case study describes a developmentally delayed 4-year-old and examines 
behavioral changes that occurred in occupational therapy using sensory 
integration (SI) techniques.  The use of play observation to measure change 
following SI treatment is discussed, and the relevance of qualitative 
methodologies to collecting data on play is demonstrated.  (Author/KM)<BR>
