<B>Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Photoevolution of Hydrogen and 
Oxygen in a Mutant of Chlamydomonas Lacking Photosystem I;<br>

We found that a mutant strain of <I>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</I>  
alga that contains Photosystem II (PSII), but not Photosystem I, can fix 
atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB>and produce molecular hydrogen and oxygen for 
prolonged periods.  The rates of both CO<SUB>2</SUB>fixation and 
hydrogen/oxygen production are similar for the mutant and a wild-type 
strain containing both photosystems.  The wild type showed stable 
photosynthetic activity, measured as CO<SUB>2</SUB>  fixation, under both 
aerobic (oxygen is present) and anaerobic (oxygen is not present) 
conditions, while the mutant was stable only under anaerobic conditions.  

<P>
Our research illustrates a new type of photosynthesis being performed by 
the PSII light 
reaction.  It also hints at the evolution and origin of water-splitting 
photosynthesis.  Previous researchers have suggested that some sort of 
genetic fusion took place between two bacteria using the two different 
photosynthetic mechanisms.  Subsequently, the two systems were linked, 
and the oxygen-producing system (PSII) was added to plants' capabilities.  
However, no examples of the intermediate stages of this type of evolution 
have been observed.  Our hypothesis is that bacteria first evolved using 
PSII photosynthesis and later added the PSI capability when molecular 
oxygen became a major component of the Earth's atmosphere.

<b><I>Recent Advances:</I></b>
<P>Photoautotrophic growth was studied under photoinhibitory conditions:

 high light intensity with air.  Photoautotrophically grown cultures

were used as inocula for the experiment.  The experimental results

showed that PSI-deficient mutants can grow under high light intensity

with air, although they have less resistance to photoinhibition

than the wild type.  In 12 day-and-night cycles, the mutants grew

from an initial population of 6.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml to a final 
culture

density about 8.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml, and 46.6% of the cells 
became

colorless (photobleached), while the wild type reached a culture

density of 1.72 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml with only 7.8% of the cells 
photodamaged.

 This is an important result, since it indicates that PSI-deficient

mutants can survive under high light intensity even in air.
