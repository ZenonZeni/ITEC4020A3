<h4>June 1995<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="usmulti">US MULTINATIONALS</a></h2>
<h4>Once-only opportunity for major tax savings</h4>

<p>Later this year, US multinationals with foreign operations will have a
use-it or lose-it opportunity to maximise their US tax benefits for non-US
pension expenses.  The opportunity will arise once the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) finalises regulations under Section 404A of the Internal
Revenue Code.  From the date of issue of the regulations, companies will
have one year to make elections that will allow them to take tax deductions
for contributions and accruals under foreign branch plans -- or obtain tax
credits for plans of foreign subsidiaries -- for some or all open tax
years.  Some companies are taking the opportunity now to briefly analyse
their 404A position, in preparation for the one-year rush.

<p>Companies which fail to act within the year will have lost the opportunity
forever to make the election for all previous tax years.  In future,
multinationals will be able to make the election for each tax year,
although, once made, the election can be changed only with IRS consent.
Fortunately, the decision to elect or not can usually be made on the basis
of a simple cost/benefit analysis once the right data has been identified.

<p>US tax law generally disallows deductions for foreign pension expense
unless the foreign plans meet US tax-deductibility standards -- which few
do.  Thanks to 404A, however, US multinationals that elect to do so can
take tax deductions or obtain foreign tax credits.

<p>For some companies, a 404A election will produce significant tax
advantages:  US multinationals with foreign branch operations should
generally elect, for example.  But companies that operate through a network
of subsidiaries might not need the deductions or foreign tax credits (eg if
they're not profitable in certain foreign locations, or if they have tax
losses that are being carried forward).  In addition, some foreign plans
may be too small to be material.

<p>The right choice may not be obvious.  While organisations are more likely
to benefit from 404A if their foreign operations are profitable, a 404A
election could also produce tax advantages if they're reorganising,
selling, or liquidating foreign operations.
 Once the regulations become final, there will probably be an increase in
IRS audit activity.  Thus, companies which make a 404A election should be
armed with the appropriate analyses that will support their claims to the
IRS for any deductions/credits for foreign pension contributions or
accruals.  Already, companies without appropriate documentation are seeing
their deductions reversed.

<h2><a name="be">BELGIUM</a></h2>
<h4>New pension law applies to both insured plans and pension funds</h4>

<p>Employers will need to take urgent steps to change their pension plans and
procedures to comply with new legislation passed on 6 April 1995, to take
effect on 1 January 1996.  The main provisions of the new law, which affect
both insured plans and pension funds, are:

<p>Discrimination:  There must be no discrimination:

<ul>
<li>among employees within the same category
<li>between men and women with respect to service after 17 May 1990, and
<li>against part-time employees.
</ul>

<p><b>Eligibility:</b>  Plan membership must be immediate for employees at least 25
years old.  Vesting:  Retirement benefits must vest after one year of
service.  (Previously, the only vesting requirements were for insured
plans, where vesting after five years of plan membership was replaced by
immediate vesting on 1 January 1993.)  The law describes how the vested
benefit should be calculated and how and when it should be communicated to
members.

<p>Transfer of benefit entitlement:  Employees with vested benefits must be
given the right to transfer them to either the pension plan of their new
employer, or to an insurance company operating on a non-profit basis, in
accordance with the provisions of an old Royal Decree dated 14 May 1969.
(Currently, there are only a very few insurers that are actively offering
this facility.)

<p>Introduction, modification and discontinuance of a pension plan:  Although
employer control is explicitly confirmed in the law, a collective labour
agreement will be required to these actions, if the plan:

<ul>
<li>is contributory, and
<li>applies to all employees.
</ul>

<p>Employee participation:  The works council or, in its absence, the health
and safety committee must have the right to give its opinion on:

<ul>
<li>the choice of a pension institution or the change to another one
<li>the financing of the plan
<li>the determination of the reserves
<li>the annual communication of the vested rights
<li>the transfer of pension liabilities, and
<li>the application, interpretation and modification of the plan rules.
</ul>

<p>If, as is often the case, the pension plan does not cover all employees,
the above rights may be given to the members of the works council or the
health and safety committee who are also plan members.  Small companies
without works councils or health and safety committees are required to
inform the employees themselves, prior to reaching any decision in the
areas listed above.  (For employers with insured plans, any form of
employee participation is brand new and will come as an unpleasant
surprise.)

<p><b>Transitional rules:</b>  Except for the general statement that benefits and
transfers of corresponding reserves for service prior to 1 January 1996 may
only be requested by plan participants in as much as reserves have actually
been built up, transitional rules for existing plans will follow by Royal
Decree.

<h2><a name="eu">EUROPEAN UNION</a></h2>
<h4>Commission pushes ahead on pensions front</h4>
 In addition to pursuing its draft working document on migrant workers (see
Headlines of <a href="9504.html#eu">April 1995</a>), the Commission has now undertaken a wider
initiative concerning the movement of pension rights between member states.
This includes an attempt to resolve some of the tax implications of members
remaining in home country retirement plans when working temporarily in
another member state.

<p>Some member states (eg France with the UK, France with the Netherlands, the
UK with Denmark) already have provisions in their double taxation treaties
that give tax exemptions for employees temporarily working in one of the
states for continued membership of a pension plan in the other state.  It
is possible that the Commission will seek the inclusion of similar
provisions in other double taxation treaties.

<p>Finally, the Commission has again confirmed that it intends to take court
action against member states that impose restrictions on overseas
investment of domestic pension fund assets (see Headlines of <a href="9412.html#eu">December
1994</a>), reinforcing its commitment to liberalising pension fund assets
within the EU.

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</a></h2>
<h4>Private pension plans to become reality</h4>

<p>Following a series of unsuccessful attempts, the Italian Government has now
issued draft legislation to introduce significant tax incentives for
private defined contribution pension provision.  This draft legislation is
expected to be passed by Parliament within the next two months and is not
expected to be subject to major amendment.

<p>Companies with employees in Italy should now finally prepare to review
their retirement policy.  In particular:

<ul>
<li>Employers with an existing plan should review the implications for both existing employees and future hires.
<li>Employers with no plan should consider their retirement policy in the context of competitive practice.
</ul>

<p>In formulating their retirement policy, companies will need to take into
account the following:

<ul>
<li>Social security benefits are also currently being reviewed.  There
  is uncertainty about the extent and timing of the changes, but there
  is little doubt that benefit levels will decrease.  This is expected
  to shift the emphasis to supplementary pension provision, as has
  already occurred in most other developed countries.

<li>Many existing company plans are defined benefit arrangements which
  the final law may encourage, after a transitionary period, to be
  converted to defined contribution.

<li>Termination indemnities (so-called TFR benefits) will now need to be
  financed partly by paying cash contributions to the company pension
  plan, where one exists.  Up to now, most companies have financed all
  termination indemnities by accruing a book reserve on the company
  balance sheet.
</ul>

<h4>Agreement reached on social security pension reform</h4>

<p>The Government and powerful labour union representatives have reached
agreement on far-reaching reform measures for the troubled Italian social
security pension system.  The key changes include:

<ul>
<li>a conversion of the existing defined benefit system to a new defined contribution system

<li>a gradual move away from the current over-generous system whereby individuals can retire early with an immediate unreduced pension after making social security contributions for 35 years

<li>a gradual removal of sex discriminatory retirement ages, and an increase in social security contribution rates.
</ul>

<p>The employers' association, also present at the negotiations, refused to
sign the agreement, criticising it for implementing the changes too slowly.
The agreement is, however, now being discussed in Parliament where,
although there appears to be broad political support, significant debate is
expected.

<h2><a name="jp">JAPAN</a></h2>
<h4>1995 Shunto -- base salary increases in Japan</h4>

<p>Nikkeiren -- the Japan Federation of Employers Associations -- recently
reported this year's Shunto average monthly pay increase as 2.8%, the
lowest figure since World War II and lower than the 1994 figure of 3.1%,
the previous all-time post-war low.  The Nikkeiren figure is based on
actual increases among 299 major Japanese firms.

<p>Although Japanese firms' performance is recovering -- especially the
high-tech sector -- a combination of low CPI increases in the Tokyo area
(0.4% for fiscal year 1994), the Hanshin earthquake, yen appreciation and
the 'NTT shock' have resulted in the lowest settlement of 2.8%.

<p>The 'NTT shock' reflects the strong influence of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone on employer and employee attitudes.  NTT has the largest in-house
union with 280,000 members.  This year they agreed about one month earlier
than usual to settle at 2.8% -- possibly reflecting union concerns about
job security and restraint in the coming division spin-off into 'baby
Bells' -- a similar situation to that which occurred under US
telecommunications deregulation over a decade ago.

<p>Towers Perrin survey data on 100 non-Japanese-owned, major multinational
firms indicates that 1995 base salary increases in major multinational
companies are 3.5% --running somewhat higher than in major Japanese firms.

<h2><a name="nl">NETHERLANDS</a></h2>
<h4>Disability benefits system changed</h4>

<p>The Government has decided to scrap the penalty imposed on employers who
discharge employees into the disability programme (WAO), with effect from 1
July this year.  This penalty was intended to reduce the use of the WAO
system by imposing fines up to a maximum amount of the annual salary of any
employee discharged in this way.  At the same time, a related bonus was
paid to companies that hired WAO beneficiaries who had previously been
declared unfit for work.  This bonus system will also be scrapped from the
same date.

<p>Meanwhile, the SER, the principal advisory board on social and economic
affairs, has unanimously rejected the Government's proposal to abolish the
cash sickness benefits programme and to 'contract-out' of the disability
programmes (see Headlines of <a href="9410.html#nl">October 1994</a>), because it believes that the
opting-out mechanism will be even more expensive than the current system.
This move has not deterred the Government from pursuing its plans to
privatise sickness insurance and modify general and occupational disability
with effect from 1 January 1996.

<h2><a name="pl">POLAND</a></h2>
<h4>Sickness benefits changed</h4>

<p>The Polish Parliament (Sejm) has approved a change to the rules governing
sickness benefit.  The new rules, which came into effect on 1 March 1995,
will put financial pressure on employers (apart from those with less than
five employees who are exempt for a one-year period) to try and reduce the
amount of sick leave taken by their employees.

<p>Under the new rules, employees receive 80% of their normal pay (defined as
average earnings over the six months preceding sickness) during the first
(not necessarily consecutive) 35 days of sickness.  This amount is payable
irrespective of the employee's length of service.  After the first 35 days,
sickness benefits are paid out of social security.  Previously, social
security paid benefits for up to 26 weeks of sickness, depending on length
of employment.  The benefit varied between 75% and 100% of average earnings
(75% for less than three years' employment and 100% for eight and more).

<h2><a name="sg">SINGAPORE</a></h2>
<h4>Company car tax changes</h4>

<p>Employers and employees may wish to review the company car policy in the
light of recent changes to the tax payable on company cars, as announced in
October 1994.  The old method based the imputed value of the benefit on the
amount of personal mileage travelled per year.

<p>This approach took no account of the value of the car.  The new rules,
effective January 1994, apply a taxable benefit based on both the cost of
the car and personal mileage.  This change partially closes a tax loophole
and is consistent with the Government's policy to limit the number of cars
in Singapore.

<p>In the case of a high value car such as a Mercedes 280, the annual taxable
benefit to the employee has increased from S$1,000 under the old rules to
S$11,500 under the new rules.

<p>Clearly, older cars will carry a lower imputed value.  Despite the higher
tax liability, employers have chosen not to subsidise the higher taxes for
their employees.  The new tax treatment has, however, made the payment of
cash car allowances a more attractive alternative to providing a company
car.

<h4>Tax status of provident fund contributions and payments improved</h4>

<p>Effective 1 January 1994, the tax exemption on employee contributions to
provident funds was increased from Baht 10,000 to Baht 300,000 per tax
year.  In addition, monies paid out of the fund to terminating employees as
a result of retirement (at least age 55 and five years' participation in
the provident fund), medically certified disability or death are now
received tax-free.

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>Lords amend Pensions Bill</h4>

<p>The Pensions Bill has completed its progress through the House of Lords and
will now be debated in the House of Commons.  The Government has accepted
that the Bill will need to be changed in four areas:

<p>Description of the minimum solvency requirement:  This has been renamed as
the minimum funding requirement (MFR).  This more accurately reflects the
scope of the proposals which only effectively provide for a minimum level
of contribution to defined benefit plans with no guarantees on wind-up.

<p>Recognition of pension rights on divorce:  The Government has had to accept
two changes.  The first requires courts to recognise pension assets in
divorce settlements.  The second means that scheme trustees can be ordered
to pay part of a member's pension to a divorced spouse when it comes into
payment.  This will present many practical problems for scheme
administrators and impose additional costs.

<p>Power to determine the employers contribution rate:  The Bill will be
amended in the Commons so that trustees cannot set a contribution rate
above the rate necessary to meet the MFR without employer consent.  In its
initial form, the Bill would have given trustees this power.

<p> <b>Definition of accrued rights:</b>  The Bill's definition of these rights (which
must be protected on plan amendment) is ambiguous in the context of a
defined benefit pension scheme.  The Government has therefore agreed to
consult with the pensions industry to produce a more accurate definition.

<p>Although the Government's flexible attitude to change is encouraging, the
amendments concerning divorce have not been clearly thought through and
more work is needed.

<h4>Tax rules hit offshore retirement plans</h4>

<p>Employers should review their policies and objectives for providing
retirement benefits for international transfers, following recently
announced changes in UK tax rules.  These affect:

<ul>
<li>members of non-UK plans who work in the UK, and
<li>members of UK retirement plans who work temporarily outside the UK.
</ul>

<p>Effective 23 February 1995, the tax authorities have tightened up their
rules for granting 'corresponding approval'.  This allows certain employees
working in the UK to receive broadly the same tax advantages given to UK
tax-approved plans:  primarily, the employee is exempt from UK tax on
employer contributions to the plan and obtains tax relief on his/her own
contributions.

<p>Essentially, the authorities will only grant these concessions in future
for genuine retirement benefit arrangements in the employee's home country
and providing that specific benefit and contribution conditions are
satisfied.

<p>It appears that the main targets for these changes are offshore plans',
particularly those based in 'tax havens'.  It remains to be seen what
criteria the UK tax authorities will impose for 'corresponding approval' in
the future.

<p>Other changes have been announced that will extend the period for which
employees can remain members of UK plans when they go to work overseas.
However, companies need to be aware that continued membership may have
adverse tax implications for the company and the employee, and should
therefore consider these relaxations in the context of their overall policy
for expatriate management.

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>Survey finds employer efforts help employees prepare for retirement</h4>

<p>A new Towers Perrin survey of 1,000 working Americans provides clear
evidence that employer efforts to educate employees about the importance of
planning and saving for retirement are starting to pay off.  Compared with
the results of a similar survey we conducted in 1991, the new survey shows
that about twice as many employees are actively planning -- and more
employees are actually saving -- for retirement than just a few years ago.
The need for employees to save for retirement is growing as a result of
longer life expectancies, changing employment patterns (eg more frequent
'job hopping' and breaks in pension service) and the ongoing shift in
emphasis from defined benefit pension plans towards employee savings plans
such as 401(k)s, among other factors.

<p>Despite these positive trends, the survey also suggests that many employees
still have unrealistic expectations about retirement and lack the
understanding of investment and capital accumulation strategies needed to
put their savings to work.  These findings suggest that employer efforts to
educate employees about retirement planning, while beneficial, need to go
farther.

<p>It may be time, for example, for employers to rethink their reluctance to
communicate with employees about the basics of investing and investment
strategy.  Without such assistance, many of today's employees could find
themselves having to work longer than they'd planned or see their vision of
retirement give way to less appealing realities.

Kerstein, Valhalla,(1)(914)745 4110

<h4>Executive benefits increasingly common</h4>

<p>Another recent Towers Perrin survey of more than 200 large companies shows
how widespread special executive-only benefit arrangements have become as
Congress has imposed more and more tax restrictions and complex regulations
on broad-based ('qualified') plans.

<p>Indeed, more than 95% of the companies surveyed now offer one or more
executive plans, with supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) being
the most common.  Defined benefit SERPs, offered by 94% of the
participants, are by far the most popular, although more companies than
ever are offering executive-only savings plans that aren't subject to the
stringent 401(k) tax rules.  About a third of the companies offer executive
life insurance programmes, and a quarter offer supplemental long-term
disability plans for executives.

<p>Given that the vast majority of SERPs are merely unfunded promises to pay
benefits and the growing importance these plans are taking on as the
benefits available to executives under qualified plans have been curtailed,
it's not surprising that another recent Towers Perrin survey found benefit
security issues to be a top concern among companies that offer
executive-only retirement arrangements.  These and other trends are covered
in depth in the recently published Handbook of Executive Benefits (Irwin
Professional Publishing), written by a number of Towers Perrin consultants.
