<H1>The First World Climate 
Conference</H1>
<HR>
<B>The First World Climate Conference was one of the first major  international 
meeting on climate change. </B>Held on 12-23 February 1979 in Geneva, the 
Conference was sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization WMO) and a 
number of other international bodies. Essentially a scientific conference, it was attended by 
scientists from a wide range of disciplines. In addition to the main plenary sessions, the 
conference organized four working groups to look into  climate data, the identification of 
climate topics, integrated impact studies, and research on climate variability and 
change.<P>
<B>The Conference focused mostly on how climate change might impact human 
activities.</B> It examined the possible impacts on specific activities such as <A HREF = 
"fs101.html">agriculture</A>, fishing, forestry, <A HREF = 
"fs104.html">hydrology</A>, and urban planning. The 
conclusions were summarized in the Declaration of the World Climate Conference1, which 
highlighted the international community’s emerging perception of the climate as a vital 
natural resource. It recognized that humanity’s survival requires us to live in harmony with 
nature, and it urged governments "to foresee and to prevent potential man-made changes 
in climate that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity." The declaration also 
identified the leading cause of global warming as increased atmospheric concentrations of 
carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and changes in land 
use.<P>
<B>The Conference led to the establishment of the World Climate Programme 
(WCP) to research climate change.</B>  Emphasizing the need for more scientific 
research into the causes and effects of climate change, the First World Climate Conference 
endorsed a proposal by WMO to establish a new climate research programme. The WCP 
was set up under the joint responsibility of WMO, the United Nations Environment 
Programme UNEP), and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). It is 
composed of the World Climate Data Programme, the World Climate Applications 
Programme, the World Climate Research Programme, and the World Climate Impact 
Programme.<P>
