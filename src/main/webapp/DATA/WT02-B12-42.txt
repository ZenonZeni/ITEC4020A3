THE WHITE HOUSE <p>

Office of the Press Secretary<p>

<HR> 
For Immediate Release                                   February 3, 1994 <p>

STATEMENT OF THE PRESS SECRETARY <p>

The introduction today of the "Communications Act of 1994" marks
an important step toward fulfilling the President's goal of
congressional action this year that ensures the creation of the
National Information Infrastructure.  The Administration particularly
commends the leadership of Chairman Hollings, Senators Inouye, Danforth
and Stevens as well as the bill's co- sponsors for their leadership in
moving this process forward. <p>

Since the President issued that challenge in his State of the
Union Address on January 25th, Congress has begun hearings on
legislation pending in the House of Representatives and today
legislation has been introduced in the Senate. <p>

These actions demonstrate growing consensus and momentum behind
the goal that the President established and the principles earlier
enunciated by the Vice President. <p>

As explained in the Vice President's January 11th address, the
Administration's vision of the National Information Infrastructure is
driven by five basic principles: to promote investment, to provide and
protect competition, to secure open access, to provide for universal
service, and to ensure that government regulation is itself flexible
and adaptable. <p>

Each of these principles is reflected in the provisions of the
"Communications Act of 1994."  Its first three titles directly address
the need for universal service, telecommunications investment, and
regulatory reform.  Its provisions addressing the future activities of
Regional Bell Operating Companies and the ability of telephone
companies to provide cable service represent an effort to achieve the
dual goals of more competition and the protection of fair competition.
And the mandate that telecommunications carriers provide
nondiscriminatory access and interconnection to their facilities serves
to further the goal of open access for all companies providing
telecommunications and information services.  The Administration
remains committed to ensuring the role of the Department of Justice in
approving the entry of the Regional Bell Operating Companies into long
distance. <p>

The Administration is particularly pleased that the Senate bill
echoes the challenge issued by the President and Vice President -- that
all classrooms, libraries, hospitals and clinics be connected to the
National Information Infrastructure. <p>

This bill heads in the right direction.  As the legislative
process goes forward, the Administration looks forward to working with
the bill's sponsor and other members of the Senate on the final version
of Senate legislation.  In discussions with members of the Senate and
the House of Representatives, the Administration will continue to
emphasize the principles outlined in the Vice President's speech and
the specific proposals set forth in Administration white papers. <p>

The Administration looks forward to continuing its close work with
Congress in the creation and enactment of comprehensive legislation
this year that will enable all Americans to enjoy the benefits of an
advanced information infrastructure. <p>
