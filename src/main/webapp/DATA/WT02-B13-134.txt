<a name="RTFToC2">Haitian
Zig-Zags</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Clinton administration spent the month of July fine-tuning its policy on
Haitian refugees.  At the end of July, the US was on the verge of obtaining UN
Security Council permission to invade Haiti and restore President Aristide to
power.<p>
<p>
Haitians have been leaving their country in small boats for years.  Since 1981,
Haiti has allowed the US Coast Guard to stop boats in Haitian and international
waters to determine whether they were carrying Haitians to the US.<p>
<p>
The US has followed a zig-zag path on its treatment of "Haitian boat people."
On June 16, the US announced that henceforth Haitians picked up at sea and
seeking asylum would be eligible to present to US asylum officers on board US
ships evidence that they face persecution in Haiti.  As a result, over 11,627
Haitians were picked up by the US Coast Guard by July 6--many hoped that they
would be granted refugee status and allowed to go to the United States.  Those
turned down, about 70 percent of those requesting asylum, continue to be
returned to Haiti.  <p>
<p>
Clinton changed the policy on July 5.  After that date, Haitians picked up at
sea were sent to the US base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to present their case for
asylum.  If they were deemed in need of safe haven, they were sent to safe
haven camps, but not to the US.  Most nearby Caribbean nations have refused to
provide safe haven for Haitians.<p>
<p>
After the Clinton administration stopped shipboard hearings for refugees in
mid-July, the number of Haitians picked up by the Coast Guard dramatically
dropped.  The week of July 16, not a single Haitian was picked up, compared to
the 1,340 people picked up the previous weekend.  The decline was attributed to
a number of factors including choppy seas and soccer's World Cup.  Another
factor was that word was reaching the interior that refugees intercepted at sea
will no longer be able to settle in the US.  Members of the clergy and relief
organizations also report the Haitian government is attempting to staunch the
flow of refugees.  The relief workers say that this has meant an increase in
repression, especially in the coastal towns from where the refugees leave. <p>
<p>
In mid-July, there were 16,500 Haitians at Guantanamo, and a few hundred began
to trickle back to Haiti after they learned that, even if they could prove they
needed safe haven, they would not be going to the US.  Haitians who return to
Haiti are interviewed by Haitian immigration authorities and given money to
return home by the Haitian Red Cross.<p>
<p>
The Clinton Administration is scrambling to find places to house the Haitians
who have been deemed in need of safe haven.  Panama's President Guillermo Endra
first agreed to allow the United States to admit 10,000 Haitian refugees then
later rescinded his approval.  Panama planned to allow the Haitians to enter
Panama on a temporary basis, until a change in the current Haitian government
or a time period not to exceed one year, but bowed to internal pressure not to
allow any Haitians in the country.  On July 25, Honduras announced that it
would shelter up to 40,000 Haitians temporarily in exchange for increased US
aid.<p>
<p>
This zig-zagging Haitian policy prompted a spate of critical reviews of US
refugee and asylum policies.  Most began with the 22 words in the 1951 Geneva
Convention on Refugees--an alien who can prove that he or she faces "a
well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion"
should enjoy <u>nonrefoulement</u> in a safe country--the right not to be
returned to danger.<p>
<p>
US law applies this standard to two kinds of persons in danger of persecution
in their country of citizenship.  Refugees are outside the US, and they seek to
enter because of the dangers they face at home, and asylum seekers or asylees
arrive in the US and ask to stay because of danger at home.<p>
<p>
The problem, according to critics, is that the US does not apply these
standards consistently.  There are about 19 million refugees worldwide, and the
US establishes a worldwide limit annually on the number it will accept each
year--121,000 in FY94.  The distribution of refugees admitted to the US
reflects domestic political considerations rather than the worldwide
distribution of persons needing safety from persecution.  In 1993, 41 percent
of the refugees admitted to the US were Jews or Evangelical Christians from the
former USSR, and 32 percent were from Vietnam and Laos.  Many of these refugees
are admitted after they show that they face a lesser "credible" fear of
persecution rather than the "well-founded" fear in the Geneva Convention.<p>
<p>
Once admitted to the US, refugees receive public assistance and health care
services at rates paid by the state in which they live.  States are reimbursed
for up to eight months of assistance, even though a majority or e.g., southeast
Asian refugees in California, receive public assistance for more than five
years.<p>
<p>
Asylum policy is even more controversial.  In 1993, just over 10,000 asylum
applications were filed each month by aliens in the US --113, 290, including 31
percent from Guatemala, 13 percent from El Salvador, and 12 percent from China.
Each application can be for a family--the number of persons represented by
these applications is almost twice the number of applications.  There are over
400,000 asylum cases that have not yet been processed, representing some
700,000 to 800,000 persons, and US courts routinely order the INS to reconsider
applications from particular countries because of what the court considers to
be "biases" in the consideration of applications.<p>
<p>
To apply for asylum, persons fill out an INS form, and then, in most cases,
asylum applicants are given work permits and told to keep the INS informed of
their current address so that they can be called to an INS hearing to prove to
an asylum officer that they face persecution at home.  The INS has switched to
a last-in , first-out policy--deciding current applications first, but this
means that some asylum applications are more than three years old.  <p>
<p>
Cuba and Haiti represent stark contrasts in US policy.  All Cubans who reach
the US can become immigrants.  On July 1, 1994, a group of 140 Cubans, the
largest boatload to arrive in a decade, sailed into Miami Beach.  The
continuing deterioration of the Cuban economy has caused a dramatic increase in
arrivals from Cuba.  In June 1994, the US Coast Guard rescued 1,173 Cubans, six
times more than they rescued in June, 1993.  <p>
<p>
Haiti, by contrast, is the only country for which the US insists that persons
fleeing persecution apply within the country of persecution.  Since February
1992, some 59,000 Haitians filled out preliminary questionnaires for themselves
and/or their families.  About 17,000 of them were interviewed in Haiti by US
asylum officers, and 4,000 were deemed in danger and admitted to the US.<b><u>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Commission
Recommends Better Verification</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Commission on Immigration Reform  (CIR) is expected to release its first
recommendations in testimony before the Senate Judiciary's Immigration
Subcommittee on August 3, 1994, ahead of its scheduled interim report in
September.  CIR concluded that the employer sanctions system established in
1986 by IRCA has failed.  The current requirement that newly-hired employees
present identification that proves their identity and their right to work in
the U.S., and that both the employer and employee sign an I-9 form as evidence
of compliance, has failed, the Commission concluded, because illegal alien
workers are routinely presenting false documents and securing jobs.<p>
<p>
The CIR recommends "a comprehensive strategy to deter unlawful immigration, in
part through measures designed to make it more difficult for illegal immigrants
to obtain work in the United States."  CIR believes that this strategy should
include retaining the existing I-9 system, but issuing all workers a
credit-type Social Security card that would also include other personal
information, such as date of birth and perhaps a fingerprint.  Employees would
have to present their "Employee Verification Registration" cards when hired,
and employers could swipe them through authentication terminals that would
verify the SSN and permit the employer to ask one or two personal questions to
determine whether the new hire is presenting his card, or call an 800 number to
verify the card number and assure that the person was presenting his/her
card.<p>
<p>
The proposed verification system would be similar to the current Systematic
Alien Verification Eligibility (SAVE) system that is used to determine whether
non-U.S. citizens who apply for public assistance are eligible legal
immigrants.  However, the SAVE system has a high error rate--in more than five
percent of the cases, identification numbers submitted for verification are
first reported to be false when they are in fact valid, in part because of lags
in issuing numbers and entering them in the verification database.  To avoid
having such "false negatives" lead to employers rejecting legal workers,
employers could not refuse to hire a worker until a second check confirmed that
the number was indeed false.<p>
<p>
In addition to preventing illegal immigration by denying jobs to those who
arrive legally, but then violate the terms of their visas by overstaying and/or
working--the case of the majority of the four million illegal immigrants in the
US, according to INS calculations--the CIR is expected to discuss the access of
legal and illegal immigrants to public services.  CIR chair Barbara Jordan has
noted that, in her opinion, "Illegal immigrants are not entitled to benefits,"
and that many of California's immigration problems are due to inadequate
enforcement of federal immigration laws.  The CIR is aiming at consensus
recommendations from its eight members. <p>
<p>
The CIR's proposal raised a storm of protest when it was leaked to the press in
mid-July.  Radio talk show hosts decried it as "Big Brother" authoritarianism,
and some of those who favor curbs on illegal immigration suspect that the CIR
proposal was "leaked" by their opponents in the Clinton administration to
discredit it.<p>
<p>
Carol Rasco, Clinton's domestic policy adviser, noted that there is an
interagency group which is also studying what to do about illegal immigration,
but that the CIR and interagency group recommendations are expected to
reinforce each other.<p>

Los Angeles Times Calls For A New Bracero Program</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In a July 18, 1994 editorial, the Los Angeles Times recommended "a treaty to
legalize and then regulate the flow of Mexican workers into--but also
eventually out of--the United States."  The Los Angeles Times acknowledged that
its proposal is likely to be controversial, since the Bracero program, under
which almost five million Mexican workers entered the United States to do
farmwork between 1942 and 1964, was cursed for hurting US farmworkers and
sowing the seeds in Mexico for today's illegal immigration.<p>
<p>
The editorial has a
we've-tried-everything-to-control-illegal-immigration-and-failed-flavor.  The
Los Angeles Times recounted the corruption in the Tijuana section of the
Mexican immigration service--the director and two deputies were dismissed for
helping to smuggle non-Mexicans into the US-- and the widespread support in
California for proposals to deny public benefits to illegal aliens.  According
to the editorial, a "North American Free Labor Agreement" could deal with 50 to
60 percent--the Mexican part-- of the illegal alien influx into the US in a
constructive manner.<p>
<p>
Columnist Joel Kotkin echoed this call for a guestworker program by arguing
that immigrants in the US can be divided into intending citizen-settler and
intending guestworker-sojourner categories.  Instead of debating rights and
services for all immigrants, Kotkin argues that "newcomers who ultimately seek
to become citizens should be treated differently from those who plan to return
to their homes."  Guestworkers should have restricted access to public
services, and "their residency should be exclusively tied to their employment
status."<p>
<p>
Kotkin's argument is based on avoiding the deepening of what he calls a
"parallel society" of non-citizens.  He argues that if illegal border crossing
can be curtailed, and if employers who want to hire guestworkers could be made
to pay them decent wages and be "responsible for their medical as well as
education needs," there would be a built in bias in favor of younger
guestworkers.  If such sojourners came to the US without their families, then
they would make few demands on US public services.<p>
<p>
The contradiction in these proposals is that they assume on the one hand that
illegal immigration cannot be stopped, so that legal admissions are preferred
to illegal status.  However, they acknowledge that, before US employers can be
persuaded to hire legal guestworkers and cover the housing and related costs of
the workers temporary employment in the US, illegal immigration must be
controlled.  <p>

California Update</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
 "Save Our State'' Initiative Qualifies<p>
<p>
California voters will have a chance to vote on the "Save Our State''
Initiative--Proposition 187--on November 8, 1994.  If approved by voters, no
person -- citizen, legal immigrant or illegal immigrant -- "shall receive any
public social services to which he or she may otherwise be entitled until the
legal status of that person has been verified."  These public services include
public education, including higher education, and health care, except for
emergency health care.  Schools and hospitals would have to determine the legal
status of clients if they expect state reimbursement.  If publicly-funded
service providers suspect that a person requesting services is an illegal
alien, they are required to report that person to the Attorney General of
California and to the INS.  <p>
<p>
In addition, SOS makes it a felony to manufacture, distribute, sell or use
false citizenship documents, and requires police to report arrests of illegal
aliens to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  <p>
<p>
According to the state's legislative analyst, California could expect to save
$200 million in public service costs if SOS were approved, and an additional
$1.2 billion in public education costs.  However, it may cost $100 million to
establish a system to verify the legal status of schoolchildren and other
beneficiaries of public services, and up to $15 billion in federal
reimbursement for California may be threatened if SOS were implemented without
modifying current federal privacy rights granted to schoolchildren and public
service recipients. <p>
<p>
The SOS initiative was reportedly begun by a Santa Ana accountant who lost $1
million to an illegal alien housing contractor who  kept his assets abroad.
Two former Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, Alan Nelson and
Harold Ezell, led the petition-gathering drive, and got the California
Republican Party to endorse the initiative.  Governor Pete Wilson announced
that he will vote for the initiative, and a recent Field Poll indicated that it
is favored by 64 to 27 percent by California voters, very similar to the 64-24
percent favoring the "three strikes" initiative.  However, 63 percent of the
survey respondents had not heard of SOS; the percentage above is based on
opinion after having the ballot summary read to them. <p>
<p>
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic challenger for Governor, blasted SOS
as "mean-spirited and dangerous," and the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors voted 3-2 against endorsing the SOS initiative.  Mexican Ambassador
Gorge Montana protested that the California debate over illegal immigration is
fostering a stereotype of Mexicans as lazy and criminal.  California teachers
persuaded the 2.2 million teacher-members of the National Education Association
to oppose the SOS initiative so that its victory would not serve as another
Proposition 13-type wake-up call to the nation, and they promised $2 million to
oppose SOS.  Other opponents of SOS range from labor unions to the California
Farm Bureau.<p>
<p>
If approved and implemented, SOS would lead to an immediate challenge to Phyla
vs.  Doe, a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a Texas law
excluding illegal immigrant children from public schools. <p>
<p>
Immigration continues to play a prominent role in California campaigns.  In the
US Senate race, Democrat Diane Feinstein on July 4 released a campaign
commercial that showed Mexicans crossing illegally into California, with a
voice-over reminding listeners that she supported more US Border Patrol agents
while Republican challenger Michael Huffington did not.  Huffingon responded
with an ad blasting Feinstein for signing an ordinance as mayor that made San
Francisco a sanctuary city and prohibited spending city funds to assist
immigration enforcement.  Several ethnic groups criticized Feinstein for
"scapegoating" illegal immigration, but she defended the ads and promised to
continue to speak out on the issue, reminding interviewers of her call to levy
a $1 border crossing fee to raise more funds to hire more Border Patrol agents,
as necessary steps to deal with illegal immigration.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>Wilson's Immigration Legacy<p>
Many commentators have emphasized that the same California politicians who are
today calling for tougher immigration enforcement and federal reimbursement
took positions in the mid-1980s that contributed to illegal immigration. <p>
<p>
Governor Wilson's June 1994 trip to Washington to lobby for federal
reimbursement for the state's costs of providing services to illegal aliens
rekindled stories of Wilson's mid-1980s role in ensuring California farmers a
continued supply of flexible immigrant workers.  The major issue was whether US
farmers would, after immigration reforms dried up the supply of illegal
workers, have to obtain job-by-job US government approval of their need for
legal foreign workers, and provide each worker with a contract, as under the
Bracero and H-2 programs.  California growers preferred programs under which a
certain number of "free agent" foreign workers would be admitted to float from
farm to farm.<p>
<p>
Current White House Chief of Staff Panetta won the farmers' argument in the
House in 1984, and Governor Wilson won their argument in the Senate in 1985.<p>
<p>
There was massive fraud in the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) ultimately
included in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  About four times
too many aliens applied, and three times too many were made legal immigrants.
Mostly young and married men--but not their families--were legalized, so some
say that Wilson has been hoisted on his own petard, since as Governor he must
deal with the costs of the illegal immigration to which his efforts in the
Senate contributed.<p>
<p>
On July 15, 1994, California's bonds were downgraded to among the lowest of all
states.  The state's $57.5 billion budget assumes that California will obtain
$763<p>
million in federal reimbursement for the costs of illegal immigration in FY94,
and $2.8 billion in FY95.  Bond-rating agencies were doubtful that these
federal funds would materialize, so that California may have to borrow more
than the $7 billion it plans to over the next two years. <p>
<p>
Local Impacts of Immigration<p>
<p>
A small school district on the US-Mexican border was expected to be ordered to
repay $1 million in mid-July for enrolling students who did not live in the
district.  The staff of a local assemblyman videotaped students who lived in
Mexico crossing the border every day to board one of six buses the district
sent there daily, and eventually 300 students were expelled because they could
not prove that they lived in the district.  Under state law, students must live
within the school district's boundaries or receive a waiver if the local
district is to receive state payments based on average daily attendance.<p>
<p>
The controversy over illegal immigration in California can be seen in the
dispute over grocery bags in Marin County, one of the nation's richest counties
adjacent to San Francisco.  As part of a publicly-funded art project, grocery
store bags were imprinted with stories of children in the community.  One of
the children profiled on the grocery store bags was an illegal alien fourth
grader who recounted how he had used a coyote to be smuggled into the US from
Mexico.  Customers opposed to illegal immigration threatened to boycott and
picket the store if the bags were not withdrawn, and the store owner promised
to destroy the 40,000 bags.  In response to the bag furor, a few residents
promised to establish a college scholarship fund for the child.<p>
<p>
A recent study found that 67 of California's 456 cities had a Latino majority,
according to the 1990 Census of Population, and that 85 percent of these mostly
Hispanic cities had Latino mayors.  In March 1994, 253 Latinos were serving on
the city councils of 140 California cities, usually in small farmworker towns
such as Orange Cove and Parlier, or in Los Angeles suburbs such as Pomona.  <p>
<p>
Latino mayors and city council members represent 10 percent of all California
mayors and city council members, even though Latinos are 28 percent of the
state's 32 million population.  However, Latinos are only seven percent of
California voters, a fact attributable to the large number of Latino children,
the fact that half the Latino adults are not US citizens, and the tendency of
US citizens of Latino origin to not register and, if registered, not vote.<p>
<p>
These data raise the issue of whether Latino political participation would
increase if city council members were elected by district rather than at large.
Latinos have sued in several cities to replace at large with district voting.<p>

Illegal Immigrants Diverted to Arizona</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Some predicted that Operation Hold-the-Line in El Paso, Texas, and a steel wall
plus additional Border Patrol agents in San Diego, California, would divert
illegal aliens seeking entry into the US to less well guarded portions of the
Mexico-US border.  In Nogales, Arizona, there appears to be such a
diversion--apprehensions are up 60 percent in 1994 compared to 1993, and the
Border Patrol reports that Mexican migrants from areas near San Diego are
traveling nearly 400 miles east because they thought their prospects for
illegal entry were better in Arizona.  <p>
<p>
The arrival of smugglers and large numbers of illegal immigrants has been
changing life in the small towns on the border.  Many such towns are filled
with retirees who moved for the desert climate, and they lament the burglaries
and other crimes that seem to accompany illegal migration.  Sonora, across the
border from the city of 20,000 of Nogales, has 250,000 residents with over 100
US-owned maquiladora factories.  The Border Patrol is replacing a chain link
fence that can be cut with up to four miles of 10 foot military landing mats
that are welded together, and then angled into the US at the top, so that
aliens who are in the US cannot make a quick return to Mexico after committing
a crime.  These military mats have been used to construct a 14-mile fence on
the US-Mexican border south of San Diego.<p>

<a name="RTFToC7">New
Jersey Sues U.S. Government</a>
</a></h2>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>New Jersey on July 15, 1994 became the fifth state to sue the federal
government to recover the costs of providing services to illegal immigrants.
Suits have been filed by Florida, California, Texas, Arizona--New York and
Illinois are "lobbying" Washington, DC for reimbursement.  California Governor
Pete Wilson charged in last summer that almost 10 percent of the state's
spending went to provide services to legal and illegal immigrants, and that
continued illegal immigration represented an "unreimbursed" federal mandate.<p>
<p>
Most observers predict that, as a result of these lawsuits, the federal
government will provide some compensation to the states that host immigrants,
and that the federal government will also step up border controls.  Since both
responses are projected to be less-than-perfect solutions, the debate over how
much compensation to pay and how much tougher border controls should be are
expected to unleash a "100-year" debate on mass migration.<p>
<p>
Neighboring New York has kept the welcome mat out for immigrants, despite the
World Trade Center bombing and the Golden Venture's grounding off Queens with
300 illegal Chinese aliens.  According to local observers, New York Governor
Cuomo and Mayor Giuliani have resisted jumping on the anti-immigration
bandwagon because of its historical role as the port of entry for immigrants,
because the immigrants arriving in New York are diverse, and because they and
other political leaders have stressed the economic benefits of immigrants
rather than their costs.<p>
<p>
The Senate voted 52-44 on July  22, 1994 to give $ 350-million to border states
to reimburse them for costs of crime committed by illegal aliens, taking the
money away from U.S. peacekeeping dues paid to the United Nations.  There are
50,000 criminal aliens in American prisons.<p>

Immigration and Welfare Reform</a>
</a></h3>
<p>
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that eliminating welfare
benefits for legal and illegal immigrants would save $22 billion over five
years, more than the $10 to $18 billion than President Clinton's welfare reform
proposals are expected to cost.  In the 1990 Census of Population, 4.7 percent
of the foreign-born individuals, and 4.2 percent of the U.S.-born, received
some form of public assistance.  Two sub-groups of the foreign-born have
especially high rates of welfare dependency:  those who arrived as refugees,
and immigrants 65 and older.  In the 1990 COP, about 16 percent or 170,000 of
the refugees received public assistance, and 13 percent or 400,000 of the
elderly non-refugee immigrants received Supplemental Security Income (SSI).<p>
<p>
SSI payments for elderly non-immigrants are projected to cost $600 million
annually through the year 2000.  The Clinton administration hopes to reduce SSI
payments by lengthening from three to 10 years the time that (usually) adult
children of elderly immigrants can be responsible for their parents' support.
However, under current court decisions, barring poor and elderly immigrants
from SSI may shift the cost of supporting them to states, who are generally
prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment from discriminating against legal aliens
in the provision of many state-funded public assistance programs.<p>

Immigration and Balkanization</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Detailed analyses of 1990 Census data are reinforcing earlier suggestions that,
as mostly unskilled immigrants move into states and cities, unskilled Americans
move out.  This represents an historic change--at the beginning of the 20th
century, mass immigration led to greater racial and cultural mixing--the
melting pot.  The mass migration currently underway, by contrast, is producing
white flight and greater ethnic divisions.<p>
<p>
Demographer William Frey of the University of Michigan noted that most
immigrants move to seven states--California, New York, New Jersey, Florida,
Texas. Illinois, and Massachusetts-and usually to a few cities within these
states, such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Miami.  All these states,
except Florida, experienced a net outflow of poorer and less-educated US
citizens during the late 1980s.  As a result, Frey fears that the melting pot
theory will not play out well for today's immigrants.  Instead, there may be
conflicts between older, better-educated, and white US citizens, and younger,
unskilled, minority immigrants.<p>

Over nine million people have applied for the "green card" lottery.  From June
1 to June 30, the special program run by the State Department accepted simple
applications from foreign nationals residing illegally in the United States and
would-be immigrants living abroad.  The lottery program was established by

to the surge of family-based immigration during the 1980s from Latin America
and Southeast Asia.  <p>
<p>
Of the 55,000 immigration slots available, 24,549 are earmarked for European
nationals; 20,200 for African nationals, and 10,251 for Asian and South
American citizens.  The only prerequisite for entering the lottery is that
applicants must have completed secondary school or have work experience in a
field requiring at least two years of study.  To apply, applicants write their
name, address, date and place of birth and the names of their spouse and
children, if any, on a blank sheet of paper.  Despite this simple process,
immigration lawyers and other advisors were charging aliens $10 to $800 to

<a name="RTFToC15">Citizenship
Applicants on the Rise</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
A record number of immigrants are seeking US citizenship; 425,000 immigrants
are expected to become citizens nationwide  in 1994.  The Los Angeles INS
office in 1993 surpassed New York as the major city of citizenship-- 500 and
600 immigrants filed citizenship papers in  Los Angeles ever day, nearly double
the number in 1992. <p>
<p>
Contributing to the rising number of aliens seeking citizenship are aggressive
citizenship sign-up drives by immigration advocates, who see the new citizens
as potential voters, and the INS, which is promoting citizenship.  INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner has said that, if more immigrants became US
citizens, it would help the nation to accept newcomers. <p>
<p>
There are other three reasons why citizenship is on the rise.  About three
million illegal aliens who obtained "amnesty" in 1987-88  become eligible to
apply for US citizenship in 1994-95;  the number of legal immigrants, who are
eligible for citizenship five years after entering the United States, rose
dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990; and some long-term residents who
have not naturalized look at US citizenship as protection against the growing
anti-immigrant backlash.<p>
<p>
Only about 40 percent of all immigrants become US citizens.  Asians
traditionally have high naturalization rates.  About 60 percent of Filipino,
and 58 percent of Chinese immigrants, for instance, apply for US citizenship,
according to a study of immigrants who arrived in 1977.  In contrast, only 16
percent of immigrants from Mexico who immigrated in 1977 sought US citizenship
within 15 years.<p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Germany's
Lead on European Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On July 1, Germany replaced Greece in the rotating Presidency of the Council of
the European Union for six months.  The European Commission, the permanent
civil service EU body, is the only body that can propose EU-wide asylum and
border control policies, which the Council then considers.<p>
<p>
The German government plans to use its six months at the helm of the European
Union to pressure other member states to share the burden of refugees who have
been concentrated in Germany.  Over 425,000 refugees have arrived in Germany
from the former Yugoslavia, and although the German government does not expect
to be able to get other EU nations to share the burden of caring for these
refugees, they hope to make arrangements with other EU nations to help with
future influxes of refugees. <p>
<p>
A draft resolution on immigration cooperation was discussed at the July meeting
of the German ministers and a delegation from the EC.  The resolution says that
all member states should contribute fairly to solve the refugee crisis by
receiving asylum seekers, participating in humanitarian and peacekeeping
situations, or EU nations can share the burden by helping to finance the cost
of protecting asylum seekers in safe areas and neighboring countries.  The
proposal uses gross national product, population and other factors to determine
each member state's overall target contribution.  <p>
<p>
German Interior Minister Kanther announced that Germany would like to a "more
just" distribution of asylum seekers in Europe--three-fourths of the 572,000
asylum seekers in 1992 came to Germany.  Britain and other EU members have not
supported burden sharing in the past.  This less restrictive approach, plus
fears of an influx of refugees from Northern Africa, may help build consensus
within the EU. <p>
<p>
Germany also announced that during the second half of 1994, the EU Council will
follow up on a June 20th resolution of the EU Interior and Justice ministers to
restrict as much as possible permanent legal immigration, and to permit
temporary foreign workers only in exceptional circumstances.  The nine EU
governments that signed the oft-delayed Schengen open border convention have
announced that the last hurdle, the Schengen Information System (SIS), will be
operating in five countries by mid-October: the Benelux nations, France and
Germany. <p>
<p>
Germany on July 1, 1993 revised its asylum law to preserve a constitutional
right to asylum but to make it difficult for persons who passed through "safe
countries" en route to Germany to apply for asylum, and allowed Germany to put
the burden of proof on applicants from "presumably safe countries,". including
Romania, Bulgaria, Gambia, Ghana, and Poland.  The German Supreme Court is
expected to rule on the legality of this "presumably safe country" provision
later in 1994.  During the first half of 1994, 62,802 aliens applied for asylum
in Germany, one-fourth as many as applied in the first half of 1993.<p>
<p>
About 10,000 aliens continue to apply for asylum in Germany each month.
However, twice as many as before are being returned to their countries of
origin after their applications are rejected, currently about 3,000 per month.
A few asylum seekers have committed suicide rather than return.<p>
<p>
On June 21, the German Bundestag approved an expansion of the number and power
of the Border Police.  Their number is to increase to 29,000 by 1996, and
penalties on illegal aliens smugglers have been raised. <p>

children, and not to get carried away by nationalist pride.<p>
<p>
In Magdeburg, a city of 300,000 in the former East Germany with 6,000
foreigners, German skinheads attacked several foreigners on May 12, 1994. The
foreigners sought refuge in a Turkish restaurant, and the police were
criticized for not preventing the ensuing brawl.  Three Germans were jailed for
up to three years for their role in the riots.  Foreigners Commissioner
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen said that "a new high" in anti-foreigner violence had
been reached.  (MN, June , 1994.)<p>
<p>
The German newsweekly, Der Speigel, interviewed four foreigners who live in
Magdeburg, and they described a life of big and small insults, and threats that
encouraged most of them to stay home at night.  Most reported few German
friends, and described instances of Germans following them with baseball bats,
being treated poorly in government offices, assumed to be shoplifters in
stores, and distrustful that the police would believe their version of attacks
and threats.  Several noted that, under the East German government, foreigners
were not attacked.  However, few of the foreigners living in the former East
Germany wanted to return to their countries of origin. <p>
<p>
On June 26, 1994, an estimated 50,000 Turks living in Germany, demonstrated
peacefully in Frankfurt against the Turkish government's treatment of Kurds in
Turkey.  Kurds are 10 to 20 percent of Turkey's 60 million population, and the
Turkish group PKK is trying to create an independent Kurdistan in the
southeastern part of Turkey.  Many Turks in Germany are Kurds, and they have
demonstrated in Germany several times in 1994 against the Turkish regime. <p>

On December 31, 1993 there were 987,405 foreigners living in Italy.  The
largest percentage were in Italy to work (34 percent), followed by family
reasons (15 percent), and unusual reasons, such as those fleeing civil war who
can work (14 percent).  In 1991, about 4,700 foreigners became Italian
citizens--4,300 on the basis of marriage to an Italian.<p>
<p>
In 1993, 1,646 aliens applied for asylum in Italy; one-third were Romanian.
Only 138 or eight percent were recognized as refugees, and one-third of those
recognized were Iraqis and Iranians.  However, there were an additional 26,617
nationals of ex-Yugoslavia and Somalia who were working in Italy on temporary
work permits who did not apply for asylum.<p>
<p>
In a effort to reduce the unemployment rate, currently 11.5 percent, the
Italian government in mid-July proposed changes to Italian labor law that would
allow employers to offer employees fixed period contracts, thus making it
easier to lay off workers.  Employers would also be allowed to pay below union
wages in areas of high unemployment.  If approved, the government expects these
measures to create 150,000 to 200,000 new jobs.<p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Russia's
Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
There are 400,000 foreign workers in Russia, but only 200,000 Russians working
abroad, according to the Federal Migration Service.  There are up to 500,000
additional "transit migrants" in Russia--sometimes referred to in the Russian
press as "illegals"--such as Iraqis, Iranians, etc., who arrived in Russia with
tourist or student visas, and nationals of former USSR states as well as the
Chinese, who could previously enter Russia without visas.  Many hope to apply
for asylum in Western Europe, or be smuggled illegally to the US.<p>
<p>
Russia has concluded "bilateral agreements" with over 60 countries from Germany
and Poland to China and Greece under which Russian workers can go abroad on the
basis of (1) an individual employer-employee contract, (2) an
employer-to-employer agreement (under which the Russians remain Russian
employees while abroad), and (3) an intermediary-Russian worker agreement.  In
some cases, it appears that these agreements are with individuals from these
countries, such as an American who signs an agreement to import Russian
workers, but still has to obtain H-2A or H-2B visas to have them admitted.  An
estimated 60 percent of the 200,000 workers abroad are employed under
employer-to-employer agreements, and 20 percent each under the other two
methods of working abroad.  Russia screens and maintains a list of workers it
considers qualified by language or skill to work abroad--the list reportedly
includes "thousands" of names.<p>
<p>
About 70 percent of the 400,000 foreign workers in Russia are from the former
USSR.  Russian employers may hire foreign workers--initially for one
year--after they convince the FMS that Russian workers are unavailable.  The
system for regulating guestworkers in Russia was "decreed" by President Yeltsin
in December, 1993 and April, 1994, and there are as yet no data on employer
requests, approvals, and rejections.  However, the Moscow city government
recently requested and obtained FMS permission to import 5,000 Ukrainian bus
drivers to fill vacancies reportedly caused by long hours and low wages.
Employers are still being educated about the sanctions law.<p>
<p>
Russia is also grappling with transit migrants.  There are reported to be at
least 200,000 foreigners in the Moscow region, including 10,000 waiting to
receive refugee status, 25,000 ex-students, 40,000 Vietnamese and Chinese
ex-guestworkers, and 40,000 so-called "economic refugees" who entered Russia
illegally from countries that range from Nigeria to Afghanistan.   <p>
<p>
In 1994, 55 additional border control centers are to be opened, and persons
seeking asylum are to be housed in one of 12 new centers.  Decisions on
requests for asylum are to be made within three months, with one to five
percent likely to be recognized.  To reduce transit migrants, Russia has been
imposing visa requirements on formerly free entry countries such as China.<p>
<p>
Before its breakup, the former USSR had about 285 million people.  Russia has
about 150 million people--Russian and non-Russian--and there are another 25
million Russians living in the former USSR republics that are now considered
Russia's "near abroad."  Since 1990, some 2 to 4 million Russians and
non-Russians have moved to Russia--sometimes because of discrimination against
them in newly-independent CIS nations.  Some Russian politicians argue that the
most important migration problem is the threat of "millions" more migrants
moving to Russia as a result of "persecution" in the near abroad and because
Moscow offers comparatively better economic conditions.<p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>During President Clinton's visit to Latvia in July, there were
protests, mostly by Russians, against the what they see as discriminatory
citizenship.  Latvia, which regained independence in 1991 from the former
Soviet Union, grants citizenship only to citizens of the Latvian republic,
which was annexed by Moscow in 1940, and their descendants.  The Latvian
president last week sent back to Parliament for rewriting a bill which would
have restricted the chances of 500,000 Russians in Latvia from becoming
citizens.  <p>
<p>
Latvian nationalists say citizenship restrictions are needed because
immigration during the Soviet era means that ethnic Latvians have a tenuous
majority in the republic of 2.6 million people.  Non-citizens, about 800,000 in
Latvia, carry Soviet passports and, although they have permanent residency
rights, they cannot vote or buy land. <p>
<p>
Russians are leaving the Baltic nations of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.
Some 80,00 of Estonia's 500,000 non-Estonians have left since 1989 (Estonia's

<a name="RTFToC22">Czech
Republic: Foreigners Fees Increase</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The price of residency permits rose on June 1 from 200 korunas ($US7) to 1,000
korunas (US$35), and foreign residents who fail to renew their permit face a
late fee of US$138 .  Those paying 1,000 korunas for residency extension stamps
may have to fork out another 1,000 korunas to receive a new residency card.  <p>
<p>
These fee increases are a signal for foreigners to become legal, says the
Finance Ministry.  The price jump was also justified to curb immigration,
particularly from countries of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.  The
price hikes are only the latest move in a government crackdown on foreigners
overstaying their welcome in the Czech Republic.<p>
<p>
There are currently 28,000 legal foreign workers in the Czech Republic,
according to the director of Employment Services.  Most of the workers come
from Poland (8,900), the former Yugoslavia (1,700), United States (1,200),
Russia (1,600), Great Britain (900), and Germany (870)--these data do not
include an estimated 28,000 Slovaks.  <p>
<p>
The Employment Services Director reports that some experts estimate the number
of illegal workers at about 40,000.  He also observed that the foreign workers
do not endanger domestic jobs on the national scale, but they may have some
regional impacts.  Some private companies, especially in construction, prefer
to employ foreign workers because they pay them substantially lower wages. <p>
<p>
Some companies operating in the Czech republic, mostly from the Ukraine, are
importing workers from their home country.  The imported workers live in poor
conditions.  Ukrainians workers reportedly tolerate the poor conditions because
they can earn up to 50 times more in the Czech Republic than in the Ukraine.

Foreigners must have work and residency permits before they can work legally in
the Czech Republic.  Until recently the government ignored this rule, but in
1994, more companies are being checked to ascertain whether their foreign

deporting illegal workers.<p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Syndicates
Smuggle Chinese to US and Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The UN Economic Commission for Europe reports that the number of asylum seekers
in Europe and North America declined to 720,000 people last year, a drop of
100,000 or 13 percent from 1992.  The decline is attributed to the tougher
asylum laws adopted by many member nations, which comprise Europe, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Israel, Canada, and the United States.  The
number of asylum seekers declined in Western Europe and Canada, but in some
countries, such as the US, there was an increase. <p>
<p>
Criminal smuggling syndicates have reportedly organized a labyrinth of
international air, sea and land routes for human smuggling that involves
roughly 30 countries.  Smuggling people has become so lucrative for criminal
gangs that "it has replaced drug trafficking as the enterprise of choice."  <p>
<p>
China's economic growth and openness has spurred an exodus of tens of
thousands, mainly migrants from the coastal regions of South Fujian and East
Guangdong.  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak republics, are primarily
used as transit areas to smuggle Chinese into Western Europe and the US.  The
syndicates are also using the countries of Guatemala, the Dominican Republic ,
Mexico and Belize.  According to some estimates, about 100,000 Chinese are
smuggled illegally into the US each year, and another 100,000 to Europe.
During the early 1990s, about 500,000 Chinese illegally entered Europe, the
former Soviet Union and North America.<p>
<p>
In 1993, the Russian Federation had its largest annual increase in migration
since World War II. Net immigration last year reached 430,000, with 920,000
people entering and 500,000 leaving. <p>

<a name="RTFToC25">China's
Great Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
According to Chinese authorities, there are 130 million surplus workers in the
rural areas of China, and their number is projected to increase to 200 million
by the year 2000.  Surplus labor in the countryside and jobs at high wages in
China's cities and its southeastern provinces have set in motion an internal
migration believed to involve at least 50 million, and possibly 70 to 100
million internal migrants.<p>
<p>
In Beijing, there are an estimated two million "outsiders" seeking jobs in day
labor markets.  If chosen by an employer, workers are often overworked, and
sometimes fired without having been paid. <p>
<p>
The largest number of migrants is believed to be the 10 million in Guangdong
province, which surrounds Hong Kong, where they help to build and staff the
reported 5,000 factories under construction.  Rural migrants are drawn to urban
and coastal areas by wages that are two to three times what they could
farming--the construction, mining, and factory jobs that attract migrants pay
$1.25 to $1.75 per day.  However, many migrants complain of broken employer
promises and workplace exploitation, and both public authorities and criminal
gangs allegedly prey on the migrants, selling the women and children into
prostitution.<p>
<p>
The remittances sent home by migrants are seen by some as a way to transfer
wealth from richer to poorer areas of the country.  In one county in the
interior province of Sichuan, remittances of $138 million in 1993 exceeded the
value of locally produced goods, $115 million.<p>

<a name="RTFToC26">Foreigners
and Labor Shortages in Japan</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The number of foreigners living legally in Japan rose to a record level of 1.3
million on December 31, 1993 --up 40 percent since 1988-- making foreigners one
percent of Japan's population.  Koreans are 52 percent of the foreigners,
followed by Chinese (16 percent), Brazilians (12 percent), and Filipinos (6
percent). <p>
<p>
The Japanese Labor Ministry recently released a report that projected a labor
surplus in the year 2000 if annual economic growth continues at less than three
percent.  In Japan's aging society, employment of nurses and related health
occupations is projected to increase by one million over the next six years. <p>
<p>
The number of foreign overstayers in Japan was estimated to be 296, 751 on
November 1, 1993, down slightly from 299,000 on May 1, 1993.  As in the past,
85 percent of the overstayers were from five countries--37 percent were Thais,
followed by Koreans, 14 percent, Chinese and Filipinos, 12 percent each, and
Malaysians, 9 percent. <p>

Housing Foreign Workers in Malaysia</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Malaysian employers who hire foreign workers must show proof that they can
provide satisfactory housing for them.  If an employer cannot provide proof of
adequate housing for the foreign workers, the Immigration Department will not
approve the employer's application for foreign workers.  <p>
<p>
Also in July, the government decided that foreigners wishing to work legally in
Malaysia will have to undergo medical tests in their home countries by
Malaysia-sanctioned doctors.  The requirement was imposed after it was reported
that up to 30 percent of the foreign workers in the country have health
problems, and that doctors in some countries were falsely certifying the
workers to be in good health.<p>
<p>
The new requirement is an attempt to halt the proliferation of squatter
settlements in Malaysia.  Estimates of the number of foreign workers in
Malaysia range from 1 to 1.5 million in a country with a workforce of 8
million.  Most are working illegally.<p>
<p>
On July 8, the Federation of Malaysian Manufactures (FMM) appealed to the
government to lift the ban on the hiring of unskilled foreign workers in
manufacturing.  FMM reported that labor shortages were disrupting production
and posing financial problems for firms, since they lost contracts due to their
inability to assure delivery times for lack of labor.  FMM reported that most
factories were running at capacity and were unable to expand because of labor
shortages. <p>
<p>
Despite the freeze on hiring unskilled foreign workers, on July 7, Malaysia's
Rural Development Minister received Cabinet approval to recruit 17,000 foreign
workers for the rubber and palm oil plantations on a government-to-government
basis with countries in the region.  Rubber and palm oil plantations are
reportedly operating at half capacity because of the labor shortage, so that 30
percent of the 1.8 million rubber trees in Malaysia are reportedly untapped
because of labor shortages, causing a loss of US$192 million. <p>
<p>
The first legal plantation workers are due from Indonesia.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC28">Hong
Kong Residents Rush for Foreign Citizenship</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The residents of Hong Kong made a last-minute rush to obtain foreign
citizenship before China takes back the British colony in 1997.  About 42,000
people have applied for the last 13,610 passports Britain has made available
for residents of Hong Kong, the  last immigration slots left from the 1990 plan
to making available 50,000 British passports for key professionals to ensure
that they remained in Hong Kong until 1997.  <p>
<p>
These 50,000 immigrants receive British citizenship if they satisfy criteria
including age, skill, English language proficiency, community service, and
education.  Hong Kong residents were initially reluctant to apply because of
harsh criticism from China, and the feeling that anyone who took British
citizenship would be penalized in any post -1997 administration.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>First-round quotas for police, business, managers and service
professionals were not filled.  The second round has seen each class
oversubscribed.  There were 14 times the number of business professionals
seeking British passports as there are spaces.  Also oversubscribed are slots
for social workers, translators, interpreters, architects, planners, surveyors,
police and teachers. <p>
<p>
Twice as many emigrants returned to Hong Kong in 1993 as in 1992, reports the
Hong Kong Institute of Personnel Management.  Experts predict that the number
of returnees will increase until it peaks in 1997 or 1998.  The government
reports that more than 8,000 people returned to Hong Kong in 1992, after
obtaining foreign passports--some 500,000 Hong Kong residents are believed to
have foreign passports.  The typical returnee was a professional with a college
degree. 30 to 39 years old, male, and married with children.  Most migrants are
returning from Canada and Australia, which are struggling with recession and
unemployment.  A recent poll of the returnees found that 80 percent find it
"easy to get a job" but encounter problems finding housing. <p>
<p>
Immigrants from Hong Kong are no longer making Australia their destination of
choice.  Among the reasons Hong Kong residents are staying home is that Hong
Kong businesses are paying high wages for skilled professionals and managers
with language skills.  The Australian Bureau of Immigration and Population
Research reported that the number of Hong Kong residents arriving in Australia
from July to December, 1993 dropped from 4,358 to 1,667.  <p>
<p>
The number of Hong Kong people permanently departing Australia is also rising.
Departures from July-December, 1993 were 270 compared to 153 for the same
period in 1992.  The total foreign population in Australia at the end of May
was 363,000 compared to 320,700 for the same time period in 1993.<p>

Visa Bulletin, Department of State publication 9514, available from Visa
Office, DOS, Wash DC 20522-0113.  This monthly publication summarizes US
immigration categories and shows the dates on which qualified immigrants had to
apply under the various preference categories in order to receive permission to
immigrate during the current month.  <p>
<p>
There are 226,000 family-sponsored immigrant visas available annually.  In July
1994, for example, those wishing to immigrate as first preference family
unification immigrants--the unmarried (adult) sons and daughters of US
citizens-- could enter the US immediately except for those from Mexico--who had
to apply by June 25, 1993 to be eligible in July 1994--and those from the
Philippines (September 25, 1985).<p>
<p>
The longest queues were for fourth preference family immigrants--the brothers
and sisters of adult US citizens.  For most countries, those eligible to enter
in July 1994 applied 10 years earlier in 1984--25 years earlier in the case of
the Philippines.<p>
<p>
There are 143,000 employment-based visas available annually, and both
first-preference priority workers and second-preference professional can enter
without waiting.  Third-preference skilled workers can also enter without
waiting, but third-preference other (unskilled) workers must have applied in
1988 to enter in July 1994.  There are generally no waits for
special--including religious--workers, and none for investors.<p>

Asch, Beth J.(Ed).  1994.  Emigration and its effects on the Sending Country.
Available from George Vernez, Rand, 1700 Main St, Santa Monica, CA, 90407-2138.
<p>
<p>
This seven-chapter report includes a literature review and chapters on the
effects of emigration on four countries that send large numbers of immigrants
to the US:  the Philippines (by Edith Tan), Ireland (Cormac O'Grada and Brendan
Walsh), Dominican Republic (Howard Wiarda), and Mexico (Jaime Navarro).<p>
<p>
The report concludes that young, male, and married men predominate among
emigrants, and that emigrants tend to be better educated than the average
resident of the sending country, with some skills, and employed prior to
departure.  However, their skills were in most cases acquired through family
investments, so that their emigration does not represent a brain-drain loss to
government investments in education.<p>
<p>
The report concludes "that, on net, emigration has a positive effect on the
sending country."(xv).  In dealing with the 3 R's --recruitment, remittances
and returns--the report notes that emigration relieves unemployment and may
raise the wages of workers who remain behind; that remittances are spent
primarily on current consumption, but the multiplier effects of such spending
expands demand and creates jobs; and that returning migrants become productive
after about six months unemployment.  Thus , "policies restricting emigration
would not have a beneficial effect."(xvii).<p>
<p>
The report is apparently quite old.  There are surprisingly few references to
the US Commission for the Study of Migration and Cooperative Economic
Development, and the several volumes of case studies that it commissioned.  The
discussion is also flawed by outdated data, such as using 1975 stock data for
migrants in the Middle East.  This leads to a surprising table on p 18, which
ranks countries by the percentage of their population sent to the US in the
late 1980s.  The top 15 countries include the expected Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, and the Philippines, but also Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.
But the list also includes the UK (ahead of Poland), and Germany--these
countries are included only because immigration pressures in the late 1980s
seem to be based on actual immigrants since 1950, and Germany accounted for
one-third of the 1950s immigrants.  Most US immigration data series stop in
1988, before the effects of 2.7 million legalized aliens show up in immigration
data.<p>

und theoretische Analyse der internationalen Wirtschaftsmigration im 19. und
20. Jahrhundert.  Darmstadt:  Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft.<p>
<p>
Koener sees international migration as a process that accelerates the
integration of the world economy.  He observes that thinking about migration
has evolved, from conceiving of it as mostly a group phenomenon to considering
it mostly a rational choice of individuals and households.<p>
<p>
In 19th century Western Europe, up to one-third of the population increase
emigrated as a result of push factors in Europe and pull factors abroad.  A
transportation revolution--steamships--and a network factor--professional
migration recruiters--combined with liberal emigration and immigration policies
to produce the Golden Age of Migration.<p>
<p>
After the two World Wars, emigration push forces in Western Europe diminished,
and immigration polices became more selective.  In Western Europe, temporary
workers--guestworkers--were admitted under bilateral agreements, and the
rotation principle that failed in Europe was adopted and more effectively
implemented in the Middle East after 1975.<p>
<p>
Koener is a development specialist, and his discussion of why emigration
countries failed to benefit from remittances and returns is instructive.  He
finds that, in most cases, there was too much brain drain and too little
flexibility in emigration country economies to absorb remittances for
emigration to prove a short-cut to development.<p>
<p>
The book concludes that because migration is a dynamic social process, its
outcomes can never be fully predicted.  The key is flexibility on all sides,
since the process of migration changes migrants, emigration areas, and
immigration areas.<p>
