<U><I><B><FONT SIZE=4>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</FONT></B></I></U>
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 1.</B></I></U>
<P>
That the police department budget is not increased in the August
1992/1993 state budget.
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 2.</B></I></U><I> </I>
<P>
That Victoria Police numbers be reduced by 20% over the next five
years and that Victorian Government resources released through
these reductions be applied to community based crime prevention
programs.
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 3.</B></I></U><I> </I>
<P>
That a significant shift in police budget priorities take place
to reflect community concerns about violent crime. In particular
there should be an increase in the budget line expenditure for
Operation Support Services (which is currently only 1.38% of the
total police budget), which covers family violence, to take  effect
immediately.
<P>
That the current expenditure of 1 million on the police media
unit be substantially scaled down and monies be allocated to appropriate
support services.
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 4.</B></I></U> 
<P>
That an external structure such as a Statutory Body be used to
monitor and review police effectiveness in terms of policing practices
and priorities. 
<P>
The Federation believes the Law Reform Commission with its resources
 and skills in research and evaluation is best placed to carry
out this function if adequately funded.
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 5.</B></I></U><I> </I>
<P>
That the annual budget review of police department expenditure
consider police time and effectiveness according to priorities
set within a crime prevention framework. 
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 6.</B></I></U><I> </I>
<P>
That police Accountability be seriously addressed through an <B>effective
</B>external Complaints Authority. The current system lacks community
confidence and is not effective.
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 7.</B></I></U>
<P>
That external accountability structures, including an independent
Community Visitors Scheme and local non-police management and
advisory committees be established to oversee police operations
at local community level.
<P>
<U><I><B>Recommendation 8.</B></I></U>
<P>
That a Royal Commission of Inquiry be held into all operations,
management and accountability of the Victoria Police, including
specialist squads.<BR>

<P>
The Federation of Community Legal Centres submits the following
<B>Police Budget Issues </B>paper to the Finance and Budget division
( Premier's Department ) for its consideration in the context
of the August 1992/1993 State Budget. 
<P>
At a time of increasing concern about the operation and management
of Victoria Police, when the economy is in severe recession, unemployment
at its highest levels for 60 years, and amidst claims that the
State of Victoria is bankrupt, increased spending on police cannot
be justified.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>1.1  Community needs vs police interests</B></I>
<P>
The eighties saw the increased politicization of police and policing.
The Industrial strength of the Police Association combined with
the media's preoccupation with violent crime, and the close relationship
between police and journalists has ensured that law and order
has emerged as an emotive issue of important political consequence.
<P>
The industrial and political leverage of the police is such 
<P>
that politicians feel compelled to respond to police demands.
 With the State government in financial crisis many government
departments have suffered cuts to their budgets. The police budget
during this period has been maintained and increased along with
police numbers. In addition police have gained extra powers and
dramatic improvements in police industrial conditions including
nine weeks annual leave and a superannuation package the envy
of other unions.
<P>
It is apparent that police and community interests do not always
coincide and that many of the gains made by police have been at
the expense of other measures which would have been of real benefit
to the community.
<P>
<I><B>1.2  Aim of Submission</B></I>
<P>
This paper details government expenditure and the cost each Victorian
has increasingly carried to support the expansion of police resources.
The use of misleading information by the police department in
its pursuit of increased resources and powers will also be discussed.
Given police budget increases over the past five years there appears
to be no legitimate rationale for further increases, except the
politically expedient response of keeping a powerful lobby group
`quiet'.  
<P>
The Federation, alongside many organisations and community groups
share the concerns of how best to deal with the incidence of crime.<B>
We therefore submit a number of recommendations on how to make
an effective and efficient use of current police resources.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<U><B><FONT SIZE=4>2.  </FONT></B></U><B><FONT SIZE=4> <U><B><a name = "reality">THE 'REALITY' OF CRIME STATISTICS - WHAT THE POLICE DON'T SAY.</a></B></U></FONT></B>
<P>
Police have pushed for increased powers, budgets and numbers largely
on the grounds that crime has increased and police resources are
stretched. Rates of crime touted as lawlessness and media headlines
of crime waves have been based on inaccurate and misleading police
statistics. These statistics have been used  to distort the nature
and extent of the crime problem. A study of the official crime
statistics kept by the Victoria Police actually reveals a substantially
different story.  In looking at these figures, we should also
bear in mind that there has been much criticism of the way in
which police in Victoria compile and define their crime statistics.
 
<P>
A spokesperson for Victoria's Attorney General, Mr Jim Kennan,
was quoted in the &quot;Sunday Age&quot; of 29 March 1992 as saying:
 &quot;A major crime index is a major problem.  It is extraordinarily
misleading.
<P>
.....Police and criminal justice agencies had a vested interest
in creating the impression of a crime wave.....The temptation
is if you want more resources you play up the blood and violence.&quot;
<P>
If we put aside the arguments about the accuracy and reliability
of the Police Major Crime Statistics, and accept the fact that
an independent body has been created, the Bureau of Criminal Statistics,
to analyse and report on crime statistics in the future, we can
still see that the hysteria being generated around &quot;the crime
explosion&quot; is ill informed and misleading.
<P>
Relying upon the raw Victoria Police Major Crime Stats, we see
that in the five years from 1986/87 to 1990/91, the <B>total major
crime reported to the Victoria Police has increased by only 13.02%.</B>
 Total major crime reports in 1986/87 was 283,666 and in 1990/91
it was 320,604.  This increase does not allow for growth in population.
<P>
By allowing for increases in population growth, based on information
provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for Victoria,
the major crimes reported to Victoria Police increased from 67.8
per every thousand people in 1986/87 to 72.6 per every thousand
people in 1990/91.  This represents an increase of only 7.07%
in major crimes reported to police in Victoria over the five year
period after allowing for a growth in the population.
<P>
In anyone's terms, an increase of just over 7% in major crimes
reported to police over the last five years hardly represents
a major blowout in criminal activity as many would have us believe.
<P>
In the five years from 1986/87, the increase in major crimes against
the person has been <B>only 12.14% </B>after<B> </B>allowing for
population increase.  Again this cannot be seen in anyone's terms
as a major crime explosion.
<P>
The incidence of crime can be more accurately viewed in the context
of many factors, ie an increase in reporting and prosecution of
offences, high urbanisation, increased unemployment - particularly
amongst young people, lower standards of living, general social
and economic indicators related to the current recession.  The
publicised rate of violent crime released by the police media
unit needs comparison to a well researched paper by the Australian
Institute of Criminology, where national crime trends indicate
that property crimes outnumber violent crimes by a ratio of 35:1.
<BR>

<P>
<U><I><B><a name = "fear">3. PUBLIC FEAR CAMPAIGN AND THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA</a></B></I></U>
<P>
<I><B>3.1   Police / Media Relationship</B></I>
<P>
The police have a particularly close relationship with the media
because the media rely on police for information about crimes
which are a major source of news.  This dependency on police for
information means that many journalists are careful not to antagonise
police by writing critical stories, as to do so could result in
being cut off from a major source of information.  Many journalists
also develop close personal relationships with police because
of the time they spend socialising with them to develop contacts.
 Police are further assisted in their dealings with the media
by a well resourced media bureau which employs, amongst other
staff, two full time journalists.  On the other hand there is
no other organisation to which the media can easily turn to in
order to receive alternative information about policing. As a
result many criminal justice issues are written or screened which
support a police viewpoint without the balance of other perspectives.
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>3.2.   Role of Police - Public servants or political lobby
group?</B></I>
<P>
The Chief Commissioner enjoys an outspokenness about issues which
is forbidden to other senior public servants.  It is generally
thought improper for senior public servants to speak publicly
on political issues.  The heads of other government departments
are not permitted to suggest or demand that their own department
receive increased resources. Instead it is considered proper for
the appropriate Minister to represent their views in Cabinet.
It is clear that the Chief Commissioner of Police does not feel
so constrained.
<P>
The following <B>Media Reports </B>represent just a few examples
of Mr Glare's outspokenness and how police have misused crime
statistics to push for increases in powers and/or resources.
<P>
*  In April 1992 the Chief Commissioner speaking at a meeting
of Supporters of Law and Order was reported to have said &quot;We
have a crime problem in Victoria.  It is one of the worst in the
Western world and as a police we are losing the battle&quot;.
 Mr Glare, was reported to have said, he believed Victoria needed
1500 to 2000 more police and he could place an extra 1000 immediately.
Mr Glare's claim that Victoria has one of the worst crime rates
in the Western world was based on a 1989 study by the Australia
Institute of Criminology.  The study compared crime rates in 17
developed countries.  The Chief Commissioner's citing of the study
to support the suggestion that Victoria has one of the worst crime
problems in the Western world failed to point out two factors
which resulted in Victoria being placed high in the survey.  Australia
is by far the most urbanised country of the countries surveyed
and this makes a marked difference to the recording of crime.
 In addition the survey was done in an Australian summer and European
winter.  Summer crime rates are about forty per cent higher than
winter crime rates. Before meaningful comparisons can be made
between the seventeen countries it is necessary to seasonally
adjust the figures.           
<P>
*  The Police Association put out a pamphlet during the lead up
to the 1988 State election which began with the statement that
Victorians have a one in four chance of becoming a victim of major
crime by 1990.  For this prediction to have come true, major crime
would have had to have increased by 273% in Victoria in just over
one year. The Police Association  assertion was a gross distortion
of the probability of being a victim of violent crime.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
*   The Assistant Commissioner Mr Frank Green was reported to
have told a law and order meeting in April 1989 that the number
of house burglaries in Victoria had increased 98% in the previous
ten years.  Several weeks earlier the Chief Research officer for
the Crime Department, Detective Chief Inspector George Davis,
was reported to have said the burglary rate had remained static
for some years. The Detective Chief Inspector was reported to
have said &quot;What has happened is that such things as Neighbourhood
Watch have increased public awareness of crimes when they happen.&quot;
<P>
*   In 1988 police indicated that they wanted more powers to deal
with people carrying and using knives as weapons.  Police claimed
that serious knife assaults and the offence of carrying a knife
had almost doubled between 1984-85 and 1987-88.  Using police
figures in support of new legislation in relation to weapons such
as knives the Government claimed that the number of uses of knives
in serious assaults had risen by 86% between 1984-85 and 1987-88.
 The Law Reform Commission did a lengthy analysis of police statistics.
 It revealed that statistics had fluctuated from year to year,
but 10 year trends showed no significant increase.  The Law Reform
Commission's report said that when the statistics were adjusted
for population growth and looked at over 10 years, a slight decrease
in serious assaults with knives could be seen.  It also said the
police statistics - the only ones available for analysis  - were
unreliable because the categories used had changed over the years
and were &quot;largely subjective&quot;.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>3.3  Police Inspire Fear</B></I>
<P>
Rather than simply responding to crime police are  exaggerating
the crime problem to protect their self interest. Comments made
by the Secretary of the Police Association, Senior Sergeant Danny
Walsh, typify the approach taken by police. When police budget
cuts were predicted last year he was reported to have said &quot;My
advice to the people of Victoria is that they should sleep with
one eye open and one hand on a baseball bat because this police
force will not be able to protect them&quot;. 
<P>
After years of stories exaggerating the incidence of crime,  many
people now live with a fear of crime which is out of proportion
to the reality of crime. An Australian Bureau of Statistics Crime
Survey released on 22 December 1987 showed a high degree of public
apprehension about crime.  While 73% of those surveyed thought
there was a high rate of crime in Victoria, only 18% thought there
was a high rate of crime in their local area.  This shows a sharp
difference between people's direct experience of crime and their
overall perception which is largely shaped by the police driven
media. <BR>

<P>
<I><B>3.4.  Political Response to public perceptions</B></I>
<P>
In June 1992 the Assistant Commissioner for Crime Mr Falconer
was reported as being &quot;extremely concerned about the number
of attacks on people in their homes who have become `soft targets'
during the recession&quot;
<P>
This comment is worth comparing to another print media report
a few days later which covered the release of the latest police
survey on public attitudes to police service. According to a police
department press release, &quot; 50% of Victorians surveyed live
in fear of being the victim of a violent attack&quot;. Surprisingly,
the Chief Commissioner Kel Glare is reported as saying &quot;
the high level of fear was unfounded given Victoria's relatively
low aggravated burglary statistics&quot; Mr Glare further contradicts
Mr Falconer's claim by stating &quot; I've been.....in part responsible
for the creation of fear of crime and I've done that quite deliberately
and dispassionately&quot;. He goes on to say the &quot;fear is
unjustified for the majority of people in the sense that they
won't become victims...&quot;
<P>
The Police Minister's response to recent media coverage of public
fear is of concern. In the same article cited above, Mr Sandon's
supported &quot; giving the police department more resources and
more power to deal with crimes as well as a range of other measures&quot;.
<P>
Misinformation about the crime problem has resulted in decisions
about police resources and powers being made on the basis of incorrect
information and for the sake of political expediency rather than
for the benefit and protection of the community.
<P>
The Premier Joan Kirner, said the day after Kel Glare made his
comments about Victoria having one of the worst crime problems
in the Western World, that she would try to increase police resources.
 This was despite the fact that the Chief Commissioner's comments
were inaccurate and transparently designed to ensure increased
funding for police in the upcoming State budget.
<P>
<I><B>3.5.  Misuse of police powers</B></I>
<P>
When the police campaigned for increased powers to deal with weapons
on the basis that there had been an increase in knife attacks,
legislation was passed giving the police increased powers even
after it was shown that the police figures had given the wrong
impression about there being an increase in knife attacks.  When
the legislation was proposed Legal Services and the Victorian
Council of Civil Liberties complained that the legislation was
unnecessarily draconian and could result in people being charged
for carrying objects that were not weapons.  The legislation was
passed and as a result police have charged dozens of people with
wearing studded belts to keep their pants up.<BR>

<P>
<U><I><B><a name = "relevance">4. RELEVANCE OF LAW AND ORDER DEBATE TO POLICE DEPARTMENT BUDGET</a></B></I></U>
<P>
<I><B>4.1.  Who are our major crime offenders ? </B></I>
<P>
A disturbing aspect of police response to crime in Victoria is
the very high over representation of juveniles (defined as persons
aged 8-16 years) in the figures for those people taken to court
for major offences.  
<P>
In 1990/91 juveniles represented 26.57% of all offenders proceeded
against in the major crime classification, and yet represented
only 11% of the population of Victoria.
<P>
In relation to minor offences, juveniles represented 11.83% of
those proceeded against which corresponds to their representation
amongst the general population.
<P>
The over-representation of juveniles proceeded against in relation
to &quot;major crime&quot; is more concerning when recognition
is given to the fact that juvenile criminal activity is largely
in the area of <B>minor property offences </B>and not major property
offences or offences against the person.
<P>
These figures suggest that police are targeting young people who
are highly visible, easy to apprehend and obtain convictions against
whilst ignoring serious crime and those responsible for it.
<P>
<I><B>4.2.  The statistics for major crimes against the person</B></I>
<P>
Although it is of no consolation for those people who are the
victims of major crime against the person, the fact is that those
crimes represent only 2.16% of all major crime, as defined by
the Victoria Police, reported during 1990/91.  As a percentage
of all offences reported to police during 1990/91, these major
crimes against the person were only 1.57% of the total.
<P>
In contrast to major crimes against the person, very minor offences
(defined as &quot;other offences&quot; in police crime statistics)
represented 27.14% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91,
up from 24.01% in 1986/7.  Allowing for population increase, minor
offences have increased from 21.4 offences per 1,000 people in
1986/7 to 27.0 offences per 1,000 people in 1990/91.  This represents
a 26.16% increase in minor offences in real terms during this
period.  This is more than four times the increase in &quot;major
crime&quot; for the same period.  Victoria is experiencing a major
blowout in minor offences and not a crime wave.
<P>
Stealing, not including burglary and theft of motor vehicles,
represented 30.21% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91.
 The second largest category of all offences reported to police
was &quot;other offences&quot; which represented 27.14% of all
offences reported in 1990/91.
<P>
Thus nearly 60% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91
related to either minor summary offences or allegations of stealing.
<P>
The big four in terms of number of offences reported to Victorian
Police in 1990/91 were:
<P>
1. Theft          - 30.21% of total offences reported.
<P>
2. Other Offences - 27.14% &quot;    &quot;      &quot;      
 &quot;
<P>
3. Burglary       - 21.39% &quot;    &quot;      &quot;      
 &quot;
<P>
4. Fraud          - 11.55% &quot;    &quot;      &quot;      
 &quot;
<P>
These represent 9 out of 10 of all offences reported to the Victoria
Police in 1990/91.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>4.3.  Police response to where violent crime is most prevalent</B></I>
<P>
A substantial amount of police time is used responding to calls
relating to domestic violence.  However research indicates that
police do not assist women when they attend because of attitudes
which attach inappropriate stereotypes to male and female behaviour.
 Police refuse to lay criminal charges even when there is evidence
of serious assaults and   the victim wants the perpetrator charged.
Women are almost always left to fend for themselves or rely on
organisations other than police to deal with the criminal aspects
of their partners behaviours.  
<P>
According to the 1992 police survey on public attitudes to police
service, 92% of respondents believed police should intervene in
domestic violence. Given the appalling statistics on police inaction
(1990 -1991 court monitoring statistics show police acted as complainants
in only 3.42% of applications for Intervention Orders), this would
appear to be a clear mandate by the community for police to seriously
review its current `service' to women in violent relationships.
<P>
The AIC homicide monitoring in close collaboration with the Australian
Police Ministers Council (APMC) has also found that violent crime
is most often perpetrated within the family where the victim knows
the offender. One has to seriously question the expending of police
resources on new crime squads, and foot patrols when the reported
problem in dealing with domestic violence is police inaction after
intervention.
<P>
The police inaction in domestic violence should be compared to
their zeal in other areas. For example under Control of Weapons
legislation the police are charging dozens of people with wearing
studded belts for the purpose of keeping their pants up.  That
an organisation that continually claims to be under resourced
can engage in laying such frivolous charges is remarkable.
<P>
For a decade police told the public that Operation Noah, the annual
drugs phone in, was catching the &quot;Mr Bigs&quot; dealing in
hard drugs.  An analysis of the statistics from the phone in done
by the Federation of Community Legal Centres found that charges
arising out of the phone-in were overwhelmingly for use and possession
of marijuana.  As a result of the analysis done by the Federation
and the publicity given to the figures the phone-in has now been
discontinued.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>4.4  Overseas Lessons</B></I>
<P>
There are overseas examples where the push for law and order by
vested interests has driven government policies on increased powers
and resources for police. Under Margaret Thatcher strong law and
order policies have resulted in an escalation of violence, as
police increased their numbers and visibility. Similar analogies
can be drawn with the American experience.    
<P>
In comparison, France is the only western country in the last
ten years which has reported a marked reduction in the incidence
of crime. Its' implementation of crime prevention strategies as
recommended in the Bonnemaison report deviated significantly from
American and English `get tough' policies.  France has directed
its resources to crime prevention strategies which aim to improve
the quality of life through the relief of unemployment, housing,
community involvement and greater police accountability. <BR>

<P>
Whilst this model cannot be superimposed on the Victorian situation
(as has been poorly attempted in a 1987 pilot program), the principles
underpinning its approach to crime prevention should be used as
a reference point in determining where scarce government resources
should be directed. Ample evidence exists of the high costs and
low returns in maintaining traditional crime control bodies (police,
courts and prisons). Consideration of budget priorities should
take note of these experiences and available research.
<P>
<U><I><B><a name ="costs">5. COSTS TO THE COMMUNITY</a> </B></I></U>
<P>
<I><B>5.1.  Who Pays ?</B></I>
<P>
For each year in the past decade, Victorians have gained 161.2
additional police officers on average per year, at an average
yearly cost of $31.9 million.
<P>
On the basis of these figures, it can be seen that each additional
police officer has cost Victorians $197,890 per police officer
per year.  At an average annual price tag of nearly $200,000 per
year a decision to increase police numbers must be very carefully
considered.
<P>
In 1981/82 policing cost each Victorian $59.38.  In 1990/91 we
each pay $125.56 per year for our police.  At the end of this
10 year period each one of us has to find an additional $66.18
each year to pay for our police force.  <BR>

<P>
<I><B>5.2  `Overstretched' Police Force ?</B></I>
<P>
In the decade from 1981/82 to 1990/91 expenditure by Victorians
on their police force has increased by 135.3%, exceeding the CPI
inflation rate for the same period by 27.9%.
<P>
At the beginning of this decade, the Victorian Police program
outlays were $235,707,000.  By the end of the decade they had
reached $554,505,000, an increase of almost $319,000,000.
<P>
This represents an average of $31.9 million additional expenditure
on police by Victorians each year for the past 10 years.
<P>
In terms of police personnel, Victorians have obtained an additional
1,612 police officers for their extra $319,000,000 outlayed in
1990/91.
<P>
This represents a 19.09% increase in police officers during the
decade.  In 1981/82 8,444 people held the special privilege, responsibility
and powers that Victorians give to their police officers.  By
1990/91 this number had grown to 10,056.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>5.3.  What are police priorities ?</B></I>
<P>
In 1990/91 the Victorian Police spent 33.3% of their total budget
on Corporate Services.  In contrast, expenditure on local police
stations, known as Community Based Policing in the police budget,
represented 49.8% of total Expenditure with a further 1.38% being
spent on Operations Support Services.
<P>
Operation Support Services covers such things as the Firearms
Registry, State Bicycle Co-ordination, Neighbourhood Watch, Police
in Schools, Co-ordination of Community Policing Squads, child
exploitation investigation and family violence, as well as liaison
with ethnic Aboriginal and gay communities.  All of these items
shared 1.38% of Victoria Police expenditure in 1990/91.
<P>
As of June 1992 the budget allocation for the Media Director's
Office totalled over 1 million dollars. According to the Family
Violence Prevention Unit, the training of police officers on domestic
violence amounted to a `few overheads taken to police stations
where attitude problems are  identified'. Apart from the police
academy there is little training at a police station level. Given
the inappropriate use of the media (as cited above), the budget
expenditure on the media unit is a gross misallocation of resources.
<P>
<U><I><B><a name = "conclusion">6.CONCLUSION</a></B></I></U>
<P>
What is needed is a responsible, informed discussion on crime
prevention and control in reaching decisions on police budget
allocation. The consistent knee jerk or politically expedient
response to meet police demands is <B>not</B> in the interest
of greater community safety.
<P>
The Federation strongly believes that an increase in police resources
cannot be justified. With one of the highest police to population
ratios in the industrialised world an increase in police personnel
is ludicrous.
<P>
<B>Two directions are open to Victoria:</B> 
<P>
1. If we choose to support the creation of a police state then
we can rest on current government and opposition policies to further
increase police powers, numbers and resources. 
<P>
2. If we want a `healthy' society where crime is tackled from
its root causes then we can choose to implement social justice
programs and <U>non-police</U> crime prevention strategies.  

<P>
Labor's recent pledge to increase police numbers and budget is
the wrong move for a state at the crossroads of its law and order
direction.
<P>
We know from overseas experience and available research that the
greater the inequality that exists within a society the more violent
and oppressive are its living conditions. Given the: high levels
of unemployment; increasing disparity between the `haves and have
nots'; depth of the current recession, and the general gloominess
being experienced by Victorians today, it is reasonable to suppose
that need is playing a large part in the level of criminal offences
being reported to police.  
<P>
To  increase government spending on police not only drains the
state economy ,but depletes those scarce resources which can be
allocated to other areas such as health, education, housing and
employment which clearly impact on crime prevention.  Instead
of rewarding a department which prioritises self interest over
safety, increased accountability is needed over current police
spending.
