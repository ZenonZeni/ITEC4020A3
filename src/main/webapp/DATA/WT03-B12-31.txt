NETWORKS: Netaccess Multiport Modem Card

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Xircom

Tel: (805) 376-9300. In Asia: 65-323-1511. Fax: 65-224-3313

Price: Four modems: US$2,299. Eight modems: US$3,999. (Prices may
vary in Asia)

Requirements: Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card is a full-
length ISA card, requiring a 386-DX or higher processor for serial
port emulation, with more powerful CPUs needed to push Windows NT
or NetWare Connect. DRAM needs vary widely based on system
application requirements: from 4 MB to 8 MB for a basic Windows
3.1x station to 16 MB or more for an NT or OS/2 server. OS support
is robust, including compatibility with Windows 3.x, Windows NT,
and Windows 95; OS/2 2.x or higher; and NetWare 3.1x or higher.
Space in your bit box is a critical element, as there are lots of
LSI circuits producing copious amounts of heat. RAS users need to
support either AIO (NetWare), NDIS (Windows NT), or standard COM
ports. Xircom Asia says that this version will ship into some
countries in Asia-Pacific by early 1997.

N etaccess Multiport Modem Card is a full-length ISA board offering
four or eight modem ports. It features V.42bis and MNP 5
compression, onboard buffering, and speeds to 115.2 Kbps using
XMAPI mode.

Installation:

Installation path varies depending on the platform (Windows NT vs.
NetWare). Basic steps are card setup (a rotary switch sets card
mode), loading the driver from a single disk, then configuring
specific RAS and adapter settings within the OS environment.

Documentation:

Manuals are well illustrated, with succinct descriptions of
installation and operation functions. Includes complete AT and S-
register command reference, result codes, troubleshooting,
diagnostic software and support options.

Robustness/compatibility:

Supports standard COM port drivers, AIO (NetWare) and NDIS WAN
(Windows NT). Also tested with Lotus Notes.

Applicability:

Has the ability to support up to eight cards for a total of 64
ports cranking at up to 115 Kbps.

Ease of use:

Works in support of the RAS software we tested. Once setup problems
were solved, MobileView network management software sniffed out our
NetWare server, providing information on port status, signal
quality, interrupts, and connection status.

Test environment:

We tested the eight-port version in a 486-DX/66MHz HP LM server
with 32 MB of DRAM and 2 GB of hard drive space, running NetWare
4.1. We also tested it on a Compaq Deskpro 5100 100 MHz Pentium
with 48 MB of DRAM and 2 GB of hard drive space, running Windows NT
3.51.

Remote control testing was done with a Compaq LTE Elite 4/75 CXL
laptop running Windows 95 and a compatible PC running Windows 3.11
using Xircom's MobileView utility. A variety of PC-com patible
486/100 MHz-DX4s with 16 MB of DRAM were used as client stations to
establish connections using Windows 3.11, Windows NT, and OS/2 Warp
Connect 3.

Warranties and support: Check with your VAR or Xircom's Asian
office.  LAN

NETWORKS: XIRCOM'S NETACCESS MULTIPORT MODEM CARD: The All-in-One
Approach

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If you're not afraid to put all your eggs in one basket, check out
Xircom's multiport modem card-a single-board solution to remote
access networking.

ne of the problems with attaching remote access service to LAN
hardware has been the requisite multiport boards, the multiheaded
"Medusa" cables, and the multiple stacks of modems that need to be
connected. For those of you who are discouraged by the mass of
hardware confusion required for remote access, Xircom's Netaccess
Multiport Modem Cards (NMMCs) may offer you a solution.

BEYOND METROPOLIS

According to Xircom, Netaccess is the first ISA-based system to
fully integrate multimodem support into a single card, giving users
the power of either four (with the MPM-4) or eight (the MPM-8) V.34
modems in one slot.

Xircom lists the MTBF at 163,850 hours for the MPM-4 and 86,903
hours for the MPM-8. When viewed on a modem-to-modem basis,
however, Xircom's claims of a radically longer MTBF fall short of
Microcom's Deskport Fast modem, for example, which, in either a
rack or standalone external modem, lists a MTBF of 160,000 hours.
But, as Xircom points out, if all the other components required for
an operable component system are included in the calculations, the
overall MTBF for the other vendor's system may drop below
Netaccess' reliability level.

It's a bird... it's a plane...

Able to leap multiple platforms in a single bound, Netaccess is
compatible with NetWare 3.1x, NetWare 4.x, Windows NT 3.5x, and
OS/2 2.x and 3.x. Faster than a speeding parity bit, the NMMC
supports remote access services (RAS) software that complies with
Asynchronous I/O (AIO), NDIS, or standard COM port drivers. More
powerful than a local node, Xircom supports up to eight cards per
system, so if you have the slots, you could be powering up to 64
lines from a single PC. With powers and abilities far beyond
ordinary modems, the NMMC allows transmission speeds up to 115.2
Kbps when using Xircom drivers, supporting V.42bis and Microcom
Networking Protocol (MNP) 5 compression, as well as V.42 and MNP
(level 2 through level 4) error detection, with full V.34 support
for speeds between 2,400 bps and 28.8 Kbps.

One of the slickest features of Netaccess is its ability to
configure each port individually, allowing administrators to
distribute line access privileges and setups on a port-by-port
basis via their RAS configuration settings.

Netaccess cards contain two 4 KB onboard buffers-one transmit and
one receive-and include flash upgradable firmware, with firmware
revisions available via Xircom's BBS ([805] 376-9130) or Web site
(http://www.xircom.com). At the time of this writing, the latest
Netaccess release was 2.64b, although Xircom's BBS listing has a
typo showing the file to be 2.46.

Xircom has tested and approved NetWare Connect, Microsoft RAS, and
Lotus Notes for use with Netaccess, but any system that is
compatible with either AIO or NDIS standards will work. Xircom also
lists Citrix Systems' Win View for Networks and Symantec's pcAny
where access server as compatible systems.

Another of Netaccess' talents lies in its proprietary function
mode, XMAPI (Xircom Mobile Application Programming Interface).
Netaccess can function in either of two modes: straight COM port
emulation or XMAPI. Mode selection is accomplished by dialing the
rotary configuration switch to the setting for XMAPI or to other
settings that select one of several COM port emulation modes.

The XMAPI architecture provides support for high-speed, block-mode
data transfers using shared memory and onboard buffers, enabling
Netaccess to crank along at 115.2 Kbps. When operating in XMAPI
mode, the Netaccess card bypasses the motherboard UART. This factor
allows for higher transfer rates than is possible when data runs
through a serial connection via either 8250 UART or 16550 UART.
Achieving these high data transfer rates does not require a
Netaccess card on both ends of the transfer-any modem supporting
V.42bis is compatible.

UP, UP, THEN AWAY

Installation and configuration of Netaccess is easy under Windows
NT, but considerably more difficult under NetWare Connect. Xircom
has eliminated DIP switch blocks, opting instead for a single-
function, rotary-dial configuration switch that allows
configuration of the card's I/O port address, IRQ, and operation
mode (COM port emulation or XMAPI). Once you have set the card
switch and installed the card into an available ISA slot, you can
load card drivers, which are located on a single disk. Once the
drivers are loaded, you must visit the network adapter and RAS
configuration screens specific to the OS in use to make the
Netaccess card available as a port resource.

Although installation instructions are included in the product's
user manual, you may want to call Xircom's toll-free FactsLine in
the US (a fax request system) at (800) 775-0400 and request fax
document numbers 4608 (for Windows NT installation) or 4611 (for
the NetWare installation). The fax documents provide more detailed
instructions and troubleshooting information than does the product
manual.

Installation on our NetWare server was problematic as a result of
incomplete and misleading documentation concerning the loading of
the Xircom drivers. Our Xircom diskette was labeled 1.13, which, as
instructed by the documentation, led us to copy the file aioxrc.mdc
into the same directory con taining the aiomdms.mdc in an attempt
to make Xircom's multiport modem driver available to NetWare.

We discovered that merely copying this file to the server
accomplished nothing more than the consumption of a few bytes of
disk space, as nothing more is done with this file according to
Xircom's instructions.

We found that the user must manually rename the existing
aiomdms.mdc temporarily (for example, to aiomdms.old) and load the
Xircom file in its place. Instructions referring to Xircom driver
release 1.10 called for loading the version of aiomdms that was
provided on the disk, but our 1.13 variant contained no such file
in any directory. As a result, we could nottrack the installation
path using the older loading procedure, either. Instructions
regarding NetWare Connect configurations contained numerous minor,
yet annoying, errors. Those instructions tell you to select
Configuring Ports, for example, but the actual prompt is simply
named Ports. This type of mismatch was evident throughout the
NetWare Connect configuration section, which was especially
bothersome because we were running NetWare Connect 2.0, the version
specified in the included documentation. We detected a
documentation revision synchronisation syndrome.

We encountered a minor glitch when attempting to execute a load
aioxrcm1 command using command syntax provided by Xircom. At first
glance, Xircom's command syntax seems to indicate that int= and
irq= are equivalent command options, but deeper scrutiny led us to
discover that the int command accepted only a hex argument (int=b),
whereas the irq command accepted only a decimal parameter (irq=11),
hence the program's rejection of our attempted irq=11. Written
documentation did provide this information, but we would like to
see the command syntax designate these two parameters as distinct
items. This problem was further compounded by the total lack of
command examples within this section of the manual.

This is not to say that the documentation provided with the product
was entirely inadequate. On the contrary, we generally found
Xircom's Netaccess documentation to be among the best modem manuals
we've seen. The text is well written (with the exception of the
previously mentioned problems regarding NetWare installations),
offering many informative illustrations and complete reference
sections covering at commands, S-registers, and modem result codes.
Xircom's FactsLine fax documentation adds another level of detail
to an already worthy product manual.

X-ray Vision Included

NetWare network administrators will definitely want to check out
Xircom's MobileView network management software. MobileView allows
any Windows 3.x user connected to a Novell network to monitor any
Netaccess cards located in any NetWare server. MobileView installs
easily from a single diskette and provides status reports either by
card display or by port display groupings.

Card status displays include information concerning interrupts, I/O
address settings, and active drivers. Port status displays provide
port speed, connection status, modem status, and signal quality
information.

MobileView also contains an option to trap SNMP messages, which can
help track down network or card problems. Although loading the
MobileView software was a simple task, it took several discussions
with Xircom's technical support staff before we were able to get
the software to find our NetWare server.

Clicking on the Discover button causes MobileView to seek out any
NetWare servers containing Netaccess multiport modems. MobileView
then automatically adds those servers to a server database on the
remote PC. You can also manually add servers to the list, avoiding
the need to rescan the network. MobileView displays the servers it
discovers in a vertical column within the MobileView main screen
display, requiring the user to simply double-click on the desired
server's icon to select it, then to click either the Cards button
or the Ports button to view the status displays. Xircom also
provides diagnostic software and hardware to test the Netaccess
card.

Two DOS-level utilities (mpm4term and mpm8term) are included on the
Utility Soft ware disk, along with a set of RJ-11 patch cords for
loopback port testing. Once started, the diagnostic program
displays individual port information in two columns of status
boxes, with a larger command window displayed at the bottom of the
interface.

You can enter one of five commands (run, version, config, window,
and exit) to control the test program, although we found that the
system also responds to selected DOS commands, such as dir and cls.
Xircom includes a set of 28 .scr script files which you can run to
perform loopback tests using the run command. Entering run test38,
for example, runs a test between port 3 and port 8, dialing and
answering from each side of the loopback connection.

The config command scans the current rotary switch and card
settings and updates the related information contained in the
mpm8.cfg configuration file, which is used by the diagnostic
utility driver to perform the loopback tests. If you change the
card setup, you must rerun config. If you don't, the loopback tests
will report errors.

Pocketful of Kryptonite

As previously mentioned, we encountered problems getting MobileView
to find our NetWare server. Clicking the Discover button yielded a
"Local server not found" error message. Attempts at connections
from Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 workstations both failed to locate
the Netaccess card. After researching , we discovered that we had
two types of problems.

First, we found that only connections based on Virtual Loadable
Modules (VLMs) are supported within MobileView's SNMP-based search.
Because Windows NT systems do not use VLMs at all, any Windows NT
station running MobileView will fail to detect the Novell server
with the modem card.

A Windows 95 workstation could be configured to find the card, but
only if a DOS-based VLM is loaded during start-up. Without VLM
support, the Windows 95 station also fails to discover the modem.
The MobileView documentation card initially led us away from this
conclusion, as the systems requirement section stated that the
product required Windows 3.1 or higher, when it should have stated
that only Windows 3.1 and 3.11 are fully supported.

Second, we found that MobileView fails in mixed Novell environments
where both NetWare 4.10 and NetWare 3.12 servers are operating.
When we logged in to the NetWare 4.10 server (using either bindery
or directory services authentication) and also attached to a 3.12
server (only bindery authentication is available on 3.12),
MobileView failed to discover the Netaccess card located in the
4.10 server. When we logged in only to the 3.12 server or to the
4.10 server, the system discovered our modem without incident. As
we had only one multiport card to evaluate, we were unable to test
whether cards placed in both 3.12 and 4.10 machines would be
discovered using our single login hypothesis.

The readme.txt file contained on the MobileView disk contained a
little more information concerning setup and troubleshooting than
was found in the folding card, but provided no specific
requirements or troubleshooting items for either SNMP or IPX
issues. Help options simply restated the information contained on
the tent card, providing no additional information.

Conclusion

Overall, Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card is a great
product. Its pricing is comparable to its rack modem counterparts,
and it includes improved reliability and system compactness in the
bargain. Installation instructions for the NetWare portion of the
modem setup need to be cleaned up, both in the accompanying user
manuals and in the FactsLine-based documentation, to eliminate
sporadic inconsistencies. MobileView is a useful utility, but
inadequate and misleading documentation concerning specific system
requirements combined with a lack of troubleshooting information
made installation more difficult than it ought to have been.  LAN

NETWORKS: DS Expert NetPro Computing

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

7150 E. Camelback Rd., Ste. 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85251
(602) 941-3600
http://www.netpro.com info@netpro.com

Price: A two-server starter pack lists for US$1,299, with
additional agents available for US$499. In quantity, prices for
additional agents drop to about US$350 each. Support costs are
based on the number of agents, starting at US$70 per agent and
falling to US$55 each for more than 100 agents.

Requirements: DS Expert has three modules. The tree monitor runs on
only one server per tree. The agent runs on every server that has a
replica. The last module is on administrator workstations, and the
first two are NLMs that run on any server that meets Novell's
minimum requirements for NetWare. Nevertheless, NetPro recommends
that the server with the tree monitor have at least 16 MB of RAM,
and if there are more than 100 servers in the tree, the company
recommends a Pentium 90 or better with at least 32 MB of RAM.
Administrator's workstations must be running Windows 3.1 or Windows
95, with at least 16 MB of RAM. They also need about 2 MB of
permanent space for the client software and up to 20 MB of
temporary space for traces.

S Expert is the first tool for NetWare 4.x administrators that is
designed to help optimise NDS. It examines partitions and replica
rings and reports on replicas that are either over utilised or
underutilised, thus optimising the network.

Installation: The program comes on two diskettes. The installation
program, setup.exe, runs under Windows 3.1 with Virtual Loadable
Module support or under Windows 95 running the Novell 32-bit client
software. It specifically does not run under Microsoft's 32-bit
client for NetWare. The installation program copies the tree
monitor and the agent to the servers of your choice and applies the
licenses. It also provides a batch file, netpro.ncf, that you can
run to begin the monitoring process, and the installation program
adds it to your autoexec.ncf.

In order to complete the installation properly, you have to call
NetPro with your serial number, the name of your tree, and your
contact information. The company provides you with a password for
the tree manager.

Documentation: There is a 125-page, spiral-bound manual that covers
all parts of the software in minute detail. The manual starts with
an excellent discussion of NDS, partitions, and replicas, before
moving on to installation and use of the program. A nice touch is
found in Appendix B, which lists the NDS error codes and explains
them.

This list is kept up-to-date by Novell and can be found at
ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/ updates/nwos/nw410.

The program is relatively self-explanatory, which is good. The help
system is sparse, and many of the comments are self-laudatory
rather than informative.

Technical support: NetPro maintains a wide array of methods for
accessing support. You can contact the company via a BBS at (602)
941-3620, a CompuServe e-mail account at 70524,2670, a Web site at
http://www.netpro.com, an ftp site at ftp.netpro.com, and an
Internet e-mail address at info@netpro.com.

No matter how you contact the company, support is based on annual
contracts and is priced at US$70 per agent down to US$55 per agent,
depending on quantity. There is a free initial 90-day support
period, which ought to be sufficient for small shops.

Warranty: Thirty-day warranty from date of delivery.

Ease of use: From the administrator's workstation, you need to run
only one program, which brings up several different comparative
charts and tables. When synchronisation problems occur, they are
reported to the tree manager and reflected in the Windows
application. The shortcoming here is that the program does not snap
into more robust monitors such as LANDesk or GroupWise. Nor does it
have the ability to send mail or notify a pager. Simple Mail
Transport Protocol support is also lacking.

Robustness/compatibility: The program runs under Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95, but in the latter case it requires the Novell 32-bit
client for Windows. It does not run with the Microsoft client for
NetWare. Once running, however, it works as advertised with minimal
bandwidth and storage requirements. The requirement to call NetPro
for the password that's tied to the tree name brings back all of
the copy-protection problems that were common a decade ago.

Applicability: DS Expert is used to manage partitions and replicas
in a large NDS environment. It can identify replica placement
that's causing excessive bandwidth utilisation and delayed
responses. It can even suggest alternatives that would work better.
The information it presents on a single, integrated screen would
take hours to manually collect and collate using Novell's
dsrepair.nlm. Given the importance of the NDS structure to the
NetWare 4.1 environment, this is a tool that LAN administrators
won't want to be without.

Test environment: Tests were performed using 2 NetWare 4.1 servers
in a single tree. The workstations were connected via Ethernet 10-
BaseT. Workstations were a Dell 486/33 MHz with 20 MB of RAM
running Windows 3.1 and a 90 MHz Pentium-based PC with 32 MB of RAM
running Windows 95. All machines used SMC Elite 16 Combo Ethernet
adapters.  LAN

NETWORKS: NETPRO COMPUTING'S DS EXPERT: Tracing the Server Family Tree

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

DS Expert gives network administrators the tools they need to
manage the NDS database-tools that NetWare 4.x fails to provide
efficiently.

hen Novell introduced NetWare 4.0, it ushered in a shift in which
users and administrators had to get used to the idea of treating
servers as just another network resource and the idea that one logs
in to the network rather than the server. Similarly, the new
version represented a change for network designers, who had to
figure out how to store, update, synchronise, and protect these
network resources.

NetWare 4.0 was a monumental leap forward; nevertheless, I believe
it fell short in many respects. For example, the default rules for
partition and replica creation had to be revised and re-revised as
experience with the product accumulated. The first version of
NetWare 4.0 made no replicas, leaving the task to the
administrator. This plan lacked any fault tolerance and made the
first server a bottleneck. So, Novell made some adjustments, and
the next version made a replica for every server. When
synchronisation traffic from this new replica rule choked the
cables, it was up to the administrator to cut back on the number of
replicas.

The current version has a new default rule. It makes replicas on
only the first three servers created, which is a compromise that
works in many, but clearly not all cases. Another problem was that
the early versions automatically made new partitions by merely
installing a server in a container created by the installation
program. This factor created problems of its own by eliminating
automatic replication, which made the problems of 4.0 reemerge.

The dsrepair.nlm.nlm has changed, too. The initial versions of
dsrepair.nlm.nlm looked at the partitions and replicas stored on a
particular server and checked them for integrity, but those servers
had a very limited ability to communicate with other NetWare 4.0
servers on the LAN. Thankfully, the current release is a remarkably
robust troubleshooting and diagnostic tool.

With all of this progress, there is still one need that NetWare 4.0
fails to cover: a functional analysis of the current partition and
replica design. For example, network managers need to know if the
design is efficient. Is the design causing bottlenecks? Is there an
exposure due to too few replicas? Are the existing replicas used
evenly, or are there some that handle far more (or less) than their
proportionate share? Are there some replicas that take
significantly longer to synchronise, and if so, why? The purpose of
DS Expert, a program from US-based NetPro Computing, is not only to
answer these questions, but to help guide the administrator toward
a better NetWare Directory Services (NDS ) design.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

NetPro is licensed on a per-server basis. The initial package
includes the tree management program and two server agents (which
consist of the NLMs that monitor replica activity and report it to
the tree manager). Additional agents may be purchased as needed.
Servers without replicas don't need an agent, and servers with more
than one replica need only one agent. If a replica is created and
there are no additional agents available, some information is still
available, such as the replica type (read/write, master, read/only,
or subordinate reference), and is reported properly. However, no
alerts will be generated for anomalous conditions that might exist
on that server.

DS Expert comes on two diskettes. Before installing the program,
you will have to call NetPro and give the company your serial
number and tree name, after which you receive the password that
enables your program. Both the registration form and the manual
mention this need for a telephone call-however, the packaging fails
to point it out, and the box contains no special notice slip.

I went into the lab at 9 a.m. on a Sunday to install the product
and was unable to reach the company to obtain a password. Since
most prudent administrators install and test system management
software during evening and weekend hours, I suspect that limited
company availability will be a common problem. NetPro should either
print the requirement to obtain the password via telephone directly
on the box or include a notice with an appropriate message
indicating the company's hours of operation. Better yet, the
company should trust its users' honesty and abandon this indirect
copy-protection scheme.

Once I obtained the password, I found installation to be quick and
relatively painless. The program requires certain versions of CLIB
and other support NLMs, and for those whose systems have not been
updated, NetPro provides instruction on finding the latest versions
of these programs at Novell's ftp site or via NetWire, Novell's
forum on CompuServe.

The installation program asks you to specify the server that is to
host the tree management program and suggests a higher-performance
machine for those users with large LANs (NetPro claims that its
tree manager running on a 32 MB, 90 MHz Pentium easily supports 100
servers). All the servers with replicas need a copy of the agent
software, which the installation program sends out. As a nice
touch, the tree manager is capable of distributing the agent at a
later time should a replica be added to a server that never had one
before (an unused agent license is available). This feature saves
the administrator the trouble of remembering to install the agent
and the headache that comes from wondering why DS Expert isn't
reporting the activities of the new replica and the replica's
server.

Finally, the installation program adds a Windows group and two
icons-one for the program and the other for the read me file-as it
copies the administrator's application to whatever location the
installer specifies (the default is c:\dsexpert).

HELPING YOU HELP YOURSELF

Some LAN administrators are purely reactive. That is, they wait for
problems to arise, and then they fix them. Others are proactive,
anticipating problems before they occur and taking steps to prevent
them. The former approach is more common, but the latter is far
less stressful for the network manager. While DS Expert will work
for both camps, it is designed to be a proactive tool.

NDS is defined as a "loosely consistent" database. This definition
means that it does not have to be in complete synchronisation 100
percent of the time. For example, if you change your password, then
log out and log back in via some distant server, you might find
that, for a minute or two, the old password still works. The
reason? NDS uses the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) packets to
communicate, and it holds on to updates and sends them out as
single, larger packets in order to minimise bandwidth utilisation.
It can take a few minutes for an SAP broadcast to work its way from
server to server within the network. NDS is built to tolerate these
time-dependent differences.

For this reason, merely comparing the contents of two replicas and
finding some minor inconsistencies won't necessarily identify a
problem area.

On the other hand, differences that don't resolve themselves in a
fairly short time period are problems that must be addressed before
they cause erratic behaviour for users and programs.

As a result, administrators have to examine the tree and search for
problem areas. DS Expert can issue four different kinds of alerts:
Replica Sync, Time Sync, Load Average, and Low Memory/Disk Space.
Because NDS is loosely consistent, you can program DS Expert to
issue the alert only when the condition has been constant for an
extended period of time. Those without DS Expert have to use
NetWare's dsrepair.nlm NLM to keep an eye on their NDS databases.

This presents two problems. One is that the database has to be
closed while the NLM is running. The other is that dsrepair.nlm
forces an immediate synchronisation of the database. Closing the
database prevents it from handling authentication or being updated,
possibly inconveniencing users. Forcing a synchronisation wastes
bandwidth. Worst of all, because the NDS design allows for loosely
consistent replicas, any errors reported by dsrepair.nlm are
suspect.

Listing 1 shows what you may get when you run dsrepair.nlm. Even
though the display indicates an error condition, there is probably
nothing wrong with your system. The error 625 means that the server
on which dsrepair.nlm is running isn't able to communicate with
another server.

Most likely, it is a LAN or WAN communications problem, though it
can also occur if the NDS database on the other server is also
locked (if, for example, another administrator is running
dsrepair.nlm at that server). Aside from dsrepair.nlm, there is
another way to get the information on your NDS database. NetWare
provides an NDS tracing tool that is enabled by issuing the Set
command (set dstrace=on) at the console prompt.

Enabling this tool causes NDS information to be displayed on the
console in a rather cryptic form, and the information scrolls off
too quickly to read in a busy network. To make reading the
information easier, you can direct the information to a file using
the four commands shown in Listing 2. The four steps simply tell
NetWare to begin logging synchronisation information to the screen,
then to send it to a file called sys:dstrace.log, to clear the file
of previous contents, if any, and to complete resynchronisation of
all replicas.

dsrepair.nlm.nlm and the NDS tracing tool are the only two
techniques for checking the synchronisation and replica information
that NetWare provides, yet they are unreliable. The tools look at
one particular server and report on its health and well-being
without providing information about the other servers. The only way
to be sure there is a problem is to monitor the entire database
over a period of time and note the recurring inconsistencies.

This stage is where DS Expert shines. The tree monitor and its
agents are constantly looking at and keeping statistics on all NDS
network activities. A few minutes spent looking at the status
screens of the DS Expert Windows client can give an accurate
picture of the status of the database.

Figure 1 (page 86) shows the tree view. With this view, you can see
all of the partitions, servers, and replicas. The tree is shown
starting with the root, and if there are subordinate partitions, a
folder is created with those partitions as entries. If a partition
has an alert pending, its entry has a red circle next to it-those
that are problem-free display a green circle.

Expanding the tree near the errors displays a Current Alerts
subfolder. If you open that folder, you see the text of the alert
that triggered the error indicator. As an administrator, you even
have the ability to adjust the alert thresholds. For example, a
threshold of three replicas is considered to be the minimum for a
partition. If, however, you intentionally have only two, you can
set the threshold lower to suppress the alert.

If you set alert thresholds so that DS Expert indicates when an
anomalous condition occurs, you simply check the client software
from time to time and rest assured that the database is in good
health. When an occasional alert is raised, you are the first to
know, and it is possible that you will know even before the problem
begins to negatively impact the network.

The DS Statistics tab on that same screen displays the workload
being handled for a replica. Because the agents are constantly
running, they can track the number of times a particular partition
is used to resolve a name or to perform other tasks. Figure 2 shows
the statistics for several of the NDS commands, which are called
"verbs." By comparing the utilisation levels of each of the servers
in a replica ring, you can determine if access is balanced. If it
isn't, you need to decide if the situation merits further
investigation.

There are several designs that won't be balanced-for example, a
replica of a branch office partition kept in the home office will
never have the same number of accesses as the one in the branch
office itself; and there are several designs that might-for
example, several servers on the backbone that carry the entire
tree. As an administrator, you can see if the actual utilisation
meets your expectations, and you can monitor the statistics over
time to see if there are changes that you might want to address.

As a final note, DS Expert isn't an NDS design tool. If each of the
three replicas of your partition are located in the home office and
the two branch offices, DS Expert won't issue any alerts telling
you that you need a better plan or that you're wasting a lot of WAN
bandwidth for no good reason.

On the other hand, if DS Expert hasn't heard from one of the
branches for a while, it lets you know that your tree is in danger.
Also, DS Expert has no ties to tools that expedite delivery of the
alerts. There is no pager or e-mail function, nor is the program
SNMP-based. Administrators who don't remember to check the client
program might as well not install it.

THE WRAP-UP

DS Expert doesn't change anything on your NetWare 4.0 network. It
merely reports the status of your partition and replica structure
and suggests changes (such as adding replicas) that you should
make.Making modifications to an NDS tree is still an art more than
a science, and similar to an art teacher, DS Expert can identify
areas that need improvement and suggest techniques that will work
better. But, it is ultimately up to the student to execute the
task. Just as most students do better after following their
teacher's instructions, so, too, will most LAN administrators
improve their networks after studying DS Expert's advice.  LAN

NETWORKS: Java Does it for Databases, Too

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Java is an object-oriented programming language closely modeled on
C++. The main differences between the two are based on the needs
for platform independence, security, and application size. However,
there is one major similarity: In business applications, client-
server or otherwise, neither language has native support for
databases-unlike Visual Basic and Delphi. Initial Java applets were
much like a tic-tac-toe game, animation, and other visually
interesting contexts in that they lacked persistent data storage.

In order to make Java useful for corporate development, the
JavaSoft team has proposed the JavaSoft Database Connectivity
(JDBC) API. Based on the X/Open Call Level Interface, JavaSoft's
goal is "to define a generic SQL database access framework which
provides a uniform interface on top of a variety of different
database connectivity modules. This allows programmers to write to
a single database interface, enables DBMS-independent Java
application development tools and products, and allows database
connectivity vendors to provide a variety of different connectivity
solutions."

JDBC is organised like other Java subsystems (see diagram below)-
such as the I/O and the language and graphics subsystems-as a
package of classes that encapsulate a well-defined set of services.
Because of security issues and potential lack of local database
access support (that is, a preinstalled ODBC driver), the JDBC
proposal anticipates that the three-tier architecture will be very
common. In using such a scheme, Java applications make calls to a
service layer on the network whose internals handle accessing the
database(s). From that position, the middle layers could function
much the same as any OLE or object request broker (ORB) server.

NETWORKS: Client-Server Moves to the 'Net

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

What's on the horizon for client-server computing? The next bastion
to conquer is the host-based world of the global Internet.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

As computing technology evolves, this timeless cliche can be
applied as much to the computer world as to history in general. In
the beginning there were end user terminals that gave direction to
large host systems that ran the applications; the hosts pumped the
results back to the terminals. Hosts changed sizes and became more
specialised.

Then along came PCs, which revolutionised the business world,
putting the power of the old hosts on each user's desktop. But
there was a hitch: Each individual had his or her own set of
information, often duplicating his or her neighbour's machine.
Sharing that information was very difficult. LANs arrived and
seemed to resolve that problem. But every bright cloud has its
muddy brown lining: Networks were very hard to maintain and the
applications they required were hard to write.

A few years ago, some smart people recognised that the union of
relational databases and front-end applications made a potent
combination. They named the new technology client-server. Still,
there were concerns.

"How do I manage data scattered at offices all over the world?"
grumbled managers. "How do I use this expensive technology to
create closer relationships to my customers and find new models
that lower the cost of doing business?"

Some answers are found by returning to the earliest forms of
computing-host systems that take direction from user terminals.
Now, though, the connection is open to anyone. And anyone can be
secure and use rapidly created applications that change dynamically
in response to evolving conditions.

The key to this change is, of course, the Internet and its younger
cousin the intranet-here referred to jointly as the 'Net. And many
products are being developed to take advantage of the new paradigm.
Just consider the 'Net as one global host system.

SECURITY

Analysts, visionaries, and everyday Joes predict great things for
the 'Net. Stock market successes such as Netscape, Yahoo, and even
America Online are evidence of that.

Analysts estimate that within 10 years, electronic, or online,
commerce may account for about one-fifth of the U.S. economy. But
to reach anything close to that share, the inherent insecurity of a
decentralised, unorganised system such as the 'Net-where users
can't even know who owns the computers through which their traffic
passes-must be transformed.

Last year, a group of visionary companies including Visa
International, MasterCard, Microsoft, IBM, and Netscape banded
together to create Secure Electronic Technology (SET). SET is a
protocol that provides a way to automatically route payment
information between users, merchants, and their banks.

The protocol specifies technology that encrypts credit card
transactions, automates the processing and clearing of credit card
payments, works with existing security protocols (such as Secure
Sockets Layer), and is supported by toolkits from Microsoft, RSA
Data Security, and Terisa Systems. In April, Terisa Systems
introduced SecureWeb Toolkit 2.0. This standard is an early, open
commercial step toward winning the confidence of the general public
for electronic commerce.

JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT

Like a nova bursting across the night sky, a new language called
Java has swept aside competition in the race to create a standard
programming facility for the World Wide Web. Sun Microsystems
initially created the project that resulted in Java in the hopes of
developing a set-top cable television box. That market, into which
many companies poured millions of dollars over the last seven
years, is still somewhere out in the future. Java is probably the
only commercial product to come out of those years of research.

Java exploded out of Sun's labs so quickly that even now, only a
few months after it moved out of beta and into production, it is
impossible to count the books, magazines, conferences, and Web
sites devoted to it. One major computer book publisher, which
typically ships 5,000 copies of new titles to bookstores, shipped
20,000 copies of its first advanced Java programming book-and it
sold out almost immediately.

What is most amazing is that Java has achieved this unprecedented
level of acceptance while still being an incredibly hard to learn
language. It is C++ with minor differences in regard to memory
management and access to hardware. The latter delta is for
practical, rather than technical reasons: How many users would let
some unknown applet be downloaded and executed on their computers
if there was no such limitation?

JavaSoft, Sun's new subsidiary created to develop, manage, and
market Java, has proposed a new API: Java Database Connectivity
(JDBC). JDBC will allow Java applications to access any back-end
database in the same way as ODBC.

In fact, the draft proposal for the JDBC API standard states that
ODBC should be leveraged and that the two APIs, both being based on
the X/Open SQL Call-level interface, may even be able to use the
same drivers (with a small bridge driver connecting JDBC to ODBC).
(For more on JDBC, see "Java Does it for Databases, Too.")

OLD 'SOFT-Y

As late as the end of last year, Bill Gates was discounting the
significance of the Internet. Four months later, he totally
reorganised Microsoft, instructing his employees to find ways to
adapt Microsoft's products to 'Net life. Often in computing
history, new generations of technology have caused old giants to
fall, but so far Gates has avoided the myopic vision that did in
his predecessors. Microsoft has responded to the Internet surge by:

 Releasing Internet Assistants for all office components that
convert spreadsheets, databases, documents, and graphics to HTML;

 Purchasing Vermeer Technology for its FrontPage HTML editor;

 Releasing Internet Information Server at no cost;

 Announcing an end-to-end electronic commerce system called
Merchant (using the security technology discussed earlier);

 Updating the OCX standard to ActiveX to support 'Net components
and releasing a set of basic ActiveX components (such as Winsock,
ftp, HTML and Network News Transport Protocol [NNTP]);

 Adding support to Visual C++ via five new classes in the Microsoft
Foundation Classes;

 Announcing Peer Web Services to allow Windows 95 and Windows NT
users to expose folders on local hard drives as Web pages;

 Releasing VBScript, a freely available, multiplatform, lightweight
version of Visual Basic; and,

 Licensing Java, plus a Java development environment (Jakarta),
and, plans to include the Java Virtual Machine in future releases
of the operating system products.

A key theme running throughout Microsoft's efforts is leveraging
the installed skills base. Rather than requiring users to learn
completely new programming languages and tools, Microsoft now tries
to add 'Net capabilities to existing products. "Microsoft has the
resources to back all the horses in the race," said Dwight Davis,
editor of Windows Watcher. "No one knows enough to make any
predictions, but Microsoft is determined to cover all the bets."

THE REST OF THE PACK

Microsoft is not alone in providing 'Net-related tools to corporate
developers. The main competitors to Visual Basic in the low-to-
middle end of the client-server application development market are
Sybase PowerBuilder and Borland Delphi. Both are responding to the
challenge of creating applications that can live on the 'Net.

With the motto "Fast Applications Anywhere," the PowerSoft division
of Sybase had planned to ship version 5.0 of PowerBuilder by the
end of second quarter 1996. This release adds a compiler (something
users of interpreted development tools always clamour for) based on
the proven Watcom technology, and the ability to create three-tier
applications with server-based components.

However, while Visual Basic 4.0's Remote OLE facility can be used
with non-Visual Basic OLE servers, PowerSoft will take a closed
approach. In this first step into the distributed arena, Mitch
Kramer, of the Patricia Seybold Group, labeled PowerBuilder's
middleware as proprietary.

ParcPlace-Digitalk provides a mid-level development tool called the
VisualWave Development Environment. Based on its long-established
VisualWorks Smalltalk environment, VisualWave takes the drudgery
out of creating ready-to-run 'Net applications with a cross-
platform, multidatabase, object-oriented system.

It automatically converts screens, forms, and tables into HTML, and
generates the required Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. The
included Personal Web Server allows applications to be tested
directly on the development machine. On the downside, you must also
purchase the VisualWave Internet Application Server as well as
climb the steep learning curve of the encyclopedic Smalltalk class
library.

Oracle is also moving aggressively into the 'Net marketspace.
Recently, it released Designer/2000 WebServer Generator, a free
upgrade to Developer/2000. Now developers can create applications
that query Oracle databases and publish reports via browsers.

"For internal clients, Developer/2000 2.0 [this upgrade is due
before the end of 1996] would allow us to run a thin client that
runs a Java applet. So, if we need to upgrade the application, we
upgrade the server, not the client," said a senior applications
developer with a large US retail company. "Implementing multi-tier
architecture would keep client-side maintenance costs down."

Attachmate made its reputation delivering host connectivity to PCs.
But now it is moving into the 'Net as well. The Extra Developer
Series enables developers to create applications that access host
data from Windows 95 and Windows NT platforms running over
intranets or traditional networks. The host data can either be
coming from databases, mainframe screens, or program-based business
logic. QuickApp generates code for Visual Basic, C++, PowerBuilder,
and Delphi that allows systems developed in those environments to
use screen-based data.

MOVING INTO THE HIGH END

Among the range of larger scale application development systems,
Forte Software and Texas Instruments Software are taking fairly
typical approaches.

Next Software and Haht Software are bringing out completely new
tools.

Version 2.0 of Forte's eponymous software, released late in 1995,
allows enterprise developers to create dynamically partitioned
applications so that developers can tune deploy-ment needs among
client machines and any number of appropriately powered and located
servers. To add 'Net access via any browser, the company recently
announced the Forte Web Server software development kit.

In April, TI released WebCenter. Web Center, combined with an
existing TI product, Composer, delivers enterprise-class
applications that can be delivered concurrently in any of four
configurations: host/terminal, traditional client-server, PC
clients (such as spreadsheets), and 'Net clients against server-
based applications (see Figure 1).

Dan Ivanov, manager of information technology at Air Canada, says,
"We are committed to delivering strong support to our customers and
believe that WebCenter will allow us to significantly improve the
quality and speed of our customer service in a very short time."
WebCenter provides browser clients with a live 'Net page with
dynamic content rather than a display of static documents. Through
Composer's ability to connect to any database, relational or
legacy, WebCenter users can provide global data access to their own
customer base.

NEW FROM THE WEB

Next Software was originally founded by Steve Jobs to develop and
sell machines for the educational market. With the first commercial
release in 1988, though, reality forced the company to expand its
horizons to include the business market.

Over the next few years, Next struggled in a crowded Unix bazaar
and finally gave up. Instead, they have been building on the simple
yet powerful application development system that was part of the
NextStep operating system.

Most recently, the firm released the Web Objects product line. The
entry-level version offers an easy entry point for building dynamic
'Net applications that incorporate a set of prebuilt components and
WebScript. This version can be downloaded for free from
http://www.next.com.

WebObjects Pro adds the ability to incorporate C, C++, and
Objective C code as well as OLE connectivity and database client
library support. It also provides for distributed 'Net application
servers facilitating scalability and management. The top-of-the-
line version, Web Objects Enter prise, provides a complete dynamic
'Net development solution. This variant is targeted to customers
requiring a solution that encapsulates existing data and
applications.

"We're very impressed with the functionality WebObjects brings to
corporations building dynamic, Web-based ap pli cations," said Jona
thon Schwartz, president of Lighthouse Design. "In less than two
months of working with WebObjects, Lighthouse has already delivered
WebVision, a server-based developer component designed to augment
Next's technology, delivering data-driven graphics to WebObjects
developers."

Haht Software, a year-old startup, is marketing its product
Hahtsite-as a tool for stretched-thin MIS staffers who are being
pulled into 'Net development projects. Founded by a group of
executives from Q+E Software, Hahtsite uses a compiled Unix version
of Visual Basic rather than CGI scripts to handle scalability and
security issues. Applications created with this tool are entirely
server-based, with HTML pages created and accessed by browser
clients. The developer product runs on Windows 95, Windows NT, and
Solaris (see Figure 2).

DECISION SUPPORT

A basic need in most client-server systems is standard reporting.
Actuate Software is set to ship Actuate Report Server 3.0, the
first report server that can serve up reports as Universal Resource
Locators (URLs).

Using Web Agent, which connects any Web server to the report
server, corporations can make predefined report formats accessible
to any browser client. The Actuate Viewer Plug-in adds searching
and help capability, table of contents, and hyperlinks to other
reports. According to Larry Sikon, chief technologist with
Montgomery Securities, "The Report Server is oriented to high-
volume, client-server-level reporting. Overall, Actuate has done a
good job of emulating the Visual Basic mode of development, which
is visual, and which reuses objects."

IQ Software announced a new member of their IQ series of client-
server decision support software, IQ/LiveWeb, which allows users to
publish corporate data over the 'Net. It allows users to submit
queries to corporate databases, schedule them for execution, and
publish them on Web servers in HTML or Portable Document Format.

When discussing decision support, Online Analytical Processing
(OLAP) isn't far behind. Sure enough, MicroStrategy and Arbor
Software have announced server-based Web interfaces for their OLAP
servers.

Users with only a browser on their desktop can use MicroStrategy's
DSS Web to connect to DSS Server and perform the same sophisticated
data analysis as if they were connected locally. Arbor plans a
similar gateway for its Essbase OLAP server. And both plan to
integrate Java applets into their systems.

READY FOR WHAT COMES NEXT

The history of technology has taught us once again that predicting
the future is a difficult task, at best. The Internet and intranets
are still in their nascency and changing so rapidly that it is
impossible to predict what will transpire over the next year, much
less an even longer time period. Every new medium is used first as
a better way to do that which has been done before. The first cars
were merely more expensive and, of course, horseless versions of
the carriage; radio was used to send telegraphs without Morse code;
television was used to transmit radio programs with visuals added;
computers were used to automate counting and calculation.

In each instance, an individual or small group figured out some new
and different purpose for the new invention. Still, that process
took time. We see the same happening on the 'Net. It provides
faster, simpler connections to data.

Companies can set up electronic commerce systems to sell tickets,
flowers, or music without the need for direct human involvement on
their end (setting up these systems still requires a great amount
of human involvement, but that will change soon enough).

Others have set up radio stations. Down the road are plans to send
movies and television shows down the wires. But none of these are
new. The real uses of the 'Net are still out over the event
horizon.  LAN

NETWORKS: The Human Factor

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

When analysing successful and unsuccessful helpdesk
implementations, I discovered seven key attributes that the best
helpdesk practices exhibit.

 Helpdesk implementations are driven by management.

 It must distribute and discuss metrics using reports.

 Call management is centralised.

 IS staff must embrace the helpdesk tool.

 Management must define and quantify its expectations of the IS
staff.

 Helpdesk staff must be accountable.

Let's now discuss each factor briefly. For the first, it is
apparent that the managment must realise the benefits of a helpdesk
system. If management does not take ownership, the staff won't be
motivated to use the tool. Management must stress the importance of
using this system to create a knowledge base.

Distribution and discussion of metrics. Unsuccessful helpdesk
systems adhere to the paradigm "Garbage In, Nothing Out." This lack
of reporting, or metrics, usually occurs because the folks setting
up the system spent more time figuring out how to get the staff to
use the system than they did determining its value.

A manager requires staff to enter all trouble calls in the
database. However, once all the calls are logged, he doesn't know
how to mine the data for useful information, which he can then
present to superiors. When staffers realise they are entering calls
but not receiving any feedback on their performance, they stop
logging calls. To be successful, a helpdesk system must present
meaningful data to the staff and management.

Centralised call management. The helpdesk can log calls only if
they come into the helpdesk. While most helpdesk packages allow
network administrators to enter tickets, these folks are less
likely to enter records. This situation is compounded by the fact
that users usually know who to call directly to get their questions
answered. As a result, numerous calls go unreported. This
information call routing can undermine the system and adversely
affect projected staffing levels. To close this informal channel,
some organisations tell their administrators to put their phones on
"send." As a result, users reach a live person only if they call
the helpdesk.

Get IS staff to embrace the helpdesk. Most helpdesk implementations
fail because of a What's-In-It-For-Me mentality. IS staffers
usually see helpdesk tools as one more task to juggle during the
work week. Management must show the staffers the value the software
provides. Often, a disparity exists between the manager's desire to
get meaningful reports out and the staffers desire to spend time
entering that information so managers can extract it. IS staffers
don't see how this process affects them. Management must show them
how these tools will reduce their workload.

Defining expectations. A manager must specify which tickets should
be closed within an hour and which ones could be closed within a
day. Some tickets, by definition, take longer to close. For
example, if IS has to order software before it can be installed on
a user's machine, that ticket may stay open a week. However, taking
a week to answer a spreadsheet question is unacceptable.

Manages should define their expectations of IS staff in writing.
One way is to draw up a contract between the helpdesk and end users
that spells out the service level agreement between the two
parties. If managers do not define these parameters, how do they
know whether the helpdesk is meeting or exceeding users'
expectations?

Accountability. Helpdesk implementations can fail because people
start to believe that using the tool is optional.

So, how can management ensure that employees use the helpdesk
system? Money and status usually do the trick. Managers can use the
helpdesk as a tool to base performance reviews. Future raises and
promotions will be determined by how well each individual meets the
service levels managers have set. If staffers "forget" to close
calls, they will not be given an opportunity to "back date" the
ticket.  LAN

NETWORKS: Electronic Troubleshooting

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Storage Dimension, a US$60-million provider of RAID and tape
storage systems for LANs, wanted to set up an automated help desk
to provide quick response to users' inquiries. To do this, Storage
Dimensions turned to Apriori GT, a knowledge-based software
foundation program from Platinum Technology.

Using Platinum's Apriori GT, Storage Dimensions designed its own
method of Internet access for customer self service, called
TechConnect.

TechConnect is designed to help resellers, field service personnel,
customers, and other networking vendors access documented solutions
for commonly asked questions about Storage Dimensions' storage
products.

Customers can access the easy-to-use TechConnect help system 24
hours a day via the Internet (techconnect@xstor.com) or via private
online services. The knowledge base automatically provides users
with detailed, context-sensitive information on installation,
compatibility, and support for any Storage Dimensions product, as
well as related products from a wide variety of vendors. To access
this information, users simply send an e-mail message from within
his or her existing mail application describing the problem.

"The TechConnect knowledge base has a dynamic feedback loop," says
Bill Kirkwood, director of customer service and support at Storage
Dimensions. "It is constantly monitored by technical support
specialists and engineers. All problems or issues are analysed, and
resolutions are fed back into the knowledge base.

As a result, solutions are consistent and readily available to
support specialists and customers alike. The system automatically
prioritises solution documents based on frequency of use, which
speeds up resolution to the customer. In this way, trends are
discovered, and the customer becomes part of the product
development process."

Today, 25 per cent of Storage Dimensions' support inquiries come
via the Internet and up to 75 per cent of those calls are resolved
by the customers on their own (see figure).

The helpdesk staff's workload has been reduced by about 20 per
cent. Storage Dimensions paid approximately US$160,000 for the
Apriori GT and a Sun Microsystems Sparc 670 MP server; the company
achieved return on investment in less than a year. Storage
Dimensions estimates it has saved more than US$200,000 annually in
the two years Tech Connect has been online, according to Kirkwood.

TechConnect utilises the same documents that the Storage
Dimensions' technical support representatives rely on daily to
resolve 99.4 per cent of customer support inquiries. Kirkwood
points out that users now have access to these same documents via
the Internet.  LAN

NETWORKS: Dialing for Help

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Sometimes it takes a little help to make a little help. Here's how
to design an internal helpdesk that will keep your burgeoning
networks under control.

esigning a smoothly working, professional, yet cost-efficient
helpdesk support function is not an easy task. There are many
potential pitfalls to avoid.

A successful helpdesk planning project must tackle some tricky
issues, such as planning for future growth and changes in
technology and laying out provisions for the project's final
implementation.

Experts agree that the key to a helpdesk that will achieve first-
rate operation is adequate planning during the initial design
phase. This stage is when the project's team members must estimate
the current helpdesk needs and predict the near-term challenges the
helpdesk will face once it is in place. These initial plans include
important factors-such as expected growth in the number of computer
users, new applications that will need to be supported, and new
technology issues-that will impact the helpdesk during its first
years of operation.

The first step during the planning stage is for management to
ascertain that a helpdesk function is actually needed. It may be
that increased user demand for assistance is due to unusual
circumstances, such as a heavy staff turnover, an influx of new
trainees, or installation of new hardware or software. In these
cases, the temporary need for increased end-user support can be
fulfilled by other, less-costly methods.

Generally, you can easily assess your company's need for a
dedicated helpdesk when informal, ad hoc help provided by your
technical staff becomes a burden for them and disrupts their usual
activities. According to Stephen Davies, president of U.S. Computer
Group, a US-based supplier of support services, the proliferation
of departmental and companywide LANs within the corporate
enterprise is driving the need to support multivendor nodes, open
systems software, and diverse applications. This proliferation has,
in turn, led to a growth in end-user demand for assistance. This
type of support requires complex problem analysis to resolve
increasingly sophisticated computing problems, making ad hoc end-
user support a monumental task.

If your staff is no longer able to satisfy users' requests for
support on an informal basis, whether it's due to an overwhelming
number of support requests or a need for support that is beyond the
support staff's capabilities, it's time to begin to plan for a
helpdesk.

Matt Kochan, vice president of marketing and business development
at Digital Equipment, suggests that you watch for these telltale
signs that an organised end-user support function is necessary:

There is a large Data Processing staff
turnover (which indicates possible
staff-member burnout).

MIS receives poor marks from end
users (registering unhappiness among the users).

User productivity takes a dive (which could signal users'
frustration with technical tools).

If any of these symptoms are occurring, a helpdesk may be needed.

IN COMMITTEE

If it is determined that a helpdesk is needed, management's next
step is to proceed to the planning and design stage by forming a
helpdesk project committee. Delegates from company management, MIS
personnel, and end users should all be part of the helpdesk
development plan. It is important that each affected group be
involved in the helpdesk initiative for it to succeed.

The committee concept allows management, users, and support
personnel to jointly iron out helpdesk functions and expectations,
thus avoiding misunderstandings about what types of support will be
available. The committee should determine exactly which functions
the helpdesk will provide, define its functionality level, and
decide which applications, systems, and equipment will be
supported. Staffing and training requirements, hours of operation,
and budgets should also be addressed. With all parties in
agreement, anticipation of what the final helpdesk implementation
will provide will be clear, and the committee can formulate the
helpdesk's charter.

The next step is to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of an
internally operated facility vs. an external helpdesk. There are
three viable options for the implementation and management of a
helpdesk: the helpdesk function can be an in-house entity, it can
be completely outsourced, or it can be a hybrid operation that uses
both in-house staff and an outside service provider.

In-house helpdesks give you complete control over operations,
training, staffing, and costs. However, administration costs can be
high, and you will need extra time and staff to manage the
operation.

Despite the drawbacks, many small organisations may still want to
choose an internal helpdesk, explains Harvey Walker, general
manager of US-based integration firm Extranet Telecommunications.
Walker says his firm often recommends its clients do exactly that.

"If you deal with a constantly evolving product and you have to
continually train outside staff, the costs can be extremely
expensive," says Walker. "Extranet's clients are mostly small
software and Internet access companies with changing product lines.
Because of this, we usually suggest they go with internal
helpdesks." It's quicker to train internal people on the different
product changes when they are already familiar with the products,
he explains.

In a totally outsourced helpdesk situation, the helpdesk vendor
manages the entire problem resolution process. This resolution can
be done at the customer site or remotely from a designated helpdesk
facility. The vendor runs all phases of the helpdesk operation at a
predetermined cost, which benefits the customer. Of course, the
customer relinquishes all control over the operation. Training can
be challenging, as well; it is more difficult for outside people to
keep up with the constantly changing conditions of your LANs.

In a typical hybrid helpdesk solution arrangement, the outside
vendor manages the helpdesk's operation, call response, and problem
isolation process. The resolution of the problem is relegated to
the onsite staff or a designated service vendor. There are
administrative cost savings to be gained from this type of
arrangement, but you give up control over the helpdesk's management
and usually have the added disadvantage of a helpdesk facility that
is located far from your users.

There are many reasons why your company may choose to use an
outside vendor to provide its helpdesk needs.

It may be that there is a lack of technical expertise in your
company's ranks. Your company may be going through a period of
reduced growth, or management may have made a strategic decision to
dedicate resources to the company's core business. In such cases, a
total outsourcing agreement is appropriate. If the company's users
are spread out across a large geographic area or dispersed among
many locations, a remote helpdesk may be more appropriate.

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE

Once you've decided whether your helpdesk function will be
internal, external, or both, the next step is to define in detail
the level of service the helpdesk will provide.

Says US Computer Group's Davies: "It is extremely important to
obtain companywide agreement on what the helpdesk will and won't
do. Inflated user expectations and exaggerated claims of technical
resources will result in a disappointing end product, dooming the
helpdesk."

Clearly define the level of service the helpdesk will provide and
either distribute it in a report or circulate the proposed helpdesk
charter. A basic helpdesk answers telephone calls from users,
dispatches technical assistance, and tracks problem resolution. A
midlevel helpdesk tackles low-level problem-solving by asking the
caller basic questions about the problem and walking him or her
through its resolution. Problems such as downloading files, using
e-mail, or finding a lost document are easily handled in this
manner. High-level helpdesks are staffed with skilled technicians
who are capable of using remote diagnostics and expert system
packages to examine a complex system problem and resolve it.

The level of helpdesk that is best for your organisation depends
upon the capabilities of your in-house or outside vendor service,
the organisation's size, the technical competency of the user base,
and the amount of the allocated budget. Setting up high-level
support is expensive. Software costs alone can range from US$2,000
to US$7,000 per user; consulting and train ing fees average an
additional US$1,500 per day. Add these costs to the amount you will
spend on hardware, space, and labor, and you will see how
staggering the start-up cost can be.

hidden costs

There are hidden costs involved, as well. Don't underestimate the
amount of resources you will need to start and run a top-notch
helpdesk. Your start-up costs will include staffing, training,
equipment, telephone services, software, and floor space. Expenses
for training, in particular, will be ongoing. (For more
information, see "Help Yourself." For a look at a successful
helpdesk implementation, see "Electronic Troubleshooting" on page
80.)

The top priority of the planning team is to design a helpdesk that
is extremely easy for users to access-if it isn't, users will
bypass it. Users should be able to access the helpdesk with a
single telephone call. After the usual logging data (name,
location, computer type, and software used), the caller should be
able to describe the problem and be walked through the solution.

Davies advises that to ensure that the help is beneficial and
remains attractive to users when they need assistance a user-
feedback mechanism should be built in to the system. Successful
helpdesks need a scheme for gauging user satisfaction and
effectiveness. With out user feedback, the only way to grade the
operation's usefulness is through the opinions of those who work on
the helpdesk itself, which would certainly result in a subjective
evaluation. Users' satisfaction with the helpdesk can be reported
and measured in formal, companywide surveys, joint IS and user-base
meetings, or via e-mail to a designated ombudsman. Whatever means
you employ to judge users' perceptions of the helpdesk operation,
it should be performed at regular intervals on a continuing basis.

Designate a high-level manager (or management team) to oversee the
helpdesk's operations. The manager must continuously review overall
helpdesk procedures and make necessary adjustments to meet new user
demands (for example, user load increases, technology enhancements,
and operational time changes to support disparate, and worldwide
sites). Planning for this important function should be done during
the initial design stage.

Management reports tracking the user's initial call, helpdesk
action taken, and final problem resolution should be easily
obtainable. These reports will ensure that the helpdesk can quickly
adapt to users' changing needs, which is critical to its success.

Collect data that details the number of calls received (per hour,
day, week, and month), the total time taken to arrive at a
successful solution, and the number of calls that were successfully
resolved by the helpdesk vs. the number of calls that were
escalated to alternate support. These statistics should be tracked,
tabulated, and reported regularly. The helpdesk manager needs this
data to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the helpdesk
function, and the information can be used to adjust staffing,
training, and hours of operation, as necessary.

There are a number of software packages available that can help
document these types of data (see related story "Help Is on the
Way," page 67). Small companies can buy an off-the-shelf general
helpdesk software product with the needed features built in for
less than US$5,000. Larger companies, with more than 25
workstations, can expect to pay about US$1,000 per user for a
package.

DEATH BY OVERKILL

According to the helpdesk Institute, companies frequently make the
mistake of not understaffing but actually overstaffing their new
internal helpdesks. Start small and increase staff and hours of
operation as needed. Automation is playing an increasingly large
part in helpdesk services as LAN support becomes more complex. New
programs are constantly being made available. These programs
automate the helpdesk call handling process, bringing it down to
its simplest level: symptom, problem, and resolution.

Relying too heavily on automation is a common pitfall of new
helpdesk func-tions. With so many helpdesk products available, this
trap is easy to get caught in. Automation is good up to a point: It
reduces costs, allows users to access the helpdesk around the
clock, and, when used correctly, it provides efficient problem
resolution. But don't forget that, in general, people prefer live
communication with other people as opposed to computer automation.
If users are too often asked to dial up and "talk" to a machine,
they'll stop using the helpdesk no matter how efficient its
problem-solving abilities.

CAN'T GET ENOUGH HELP

Many helpdesks are already providing services and support in areas
other than problem-solving and trouble call management. Inventory
management, contract administration, user training, and
documentation distribution are all examples of services now being
handled by the typical company helpdesk.

For many organisations that now depend on their LANs for daily,
ongoing business activities, the proper staffing and operation of a
helpdesk has become as critical as the proper staffing and
operation of the marketing department. The technical tools are just
as crucial. Whether your helpdesk operation is to be basic, medium-
level, or high-level, it must be planned correctly to obtain the
proper combination of people and technology.  LAN

NETWORKS: Help Is On The Way

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Help desks are commonly viewed as expendable. But functionality and
upcoming standards may show that supporting internal users makes
good business sense.

The grim reality of corporate life in the 1990s means companies are
resorting to layoffs, cutbacks, and even going out of business.

This dilemma is being felt on a large scale in internal MIS
departments, which often have to make do with a fairly small staff
no matter how many employees need to be supported. The crisis is
compounded at the helpdesk level, where often only a handful of
individuals is charged with solving the everyday computing problems
of more employees than they can adequately manage.

While many IS departments view the helpdesk as expendable and focus
cost containment measures in this area, this decision can come back
to haunt them in the form of reduced employee productivity.

In other departments, the helpdesk may be sacrificed in favour of a
company's external customer support infrastructure, which may be
viewed as a bigger contributor to the firm's bottom line.

But with a relatively fragmented structure, no dominant player, and
dozens of proprietary products, the helpdesk market seems to be
going in many directions at once with no clear destination.

Partly to bring some cohesion to the market, several organizations
are working on standards that will provide a uniform means for
passing helpdesk data between various users and that will create a
way to import and export knowledge. This combined effort of
multiple companies will give users better information regarding the
importance of helpdesk software to an internal IT infrastructure,
as well as information as to how spending money on such resources
will actually result in a return on investment.

THE BOTTOM LINE

When IT managers find out that the total cost of ownership (the
initial price plus cost of maintenance) of just one PC can be
thousands of dollars over a few years, many start slashing funds
for what they consider nonessential items. Sometimes this means
cutting financial support for the helpdesk. But sacrificing this
asset could be equivalent to throwing the oars off a sinking boat
to make it lighter.

With a restricted helpdesk infrastructure, employees are limited to
waiting around for a member of the IT staff to show up in person to
troubleshoot their problem. Alternatively, they may ask a coworker
for help, which could cost more money in lost productivity than it
does to maintain that workstation.

A key way to do more with less is to literally enable end users to
help themselves. Most helpdesk software vendors realise that the
fewer relatively mundane calls a support analyst has to field, the
more time and energy he can devote to more severe incidents.

Instead of losing users in an endless loop of automated telephone
voice menus, it is more effective to give them control over when
and where they request information by using the World Wide Web and
an ordinary Web browser (see figure, page 76). If a user has a
question about importing an Excel chart into Word, for example,
rather than attempting to locate the appropriate information in a
manual, he may be able to surf over to the helpdesk through the
corporate intranet and type a few key words to find an answer.

For more complex problems, an individual could create a trouble
ticket and dynamically interact with it before sending it via e-
mail to the helpdesk system and waiting for an analyst to call (see
"Answers Online," page 77). The trouble ticket might be customised
depending on the department or business unit.

Using the Web to resolve IT problems may not supplant the old-
fashioned method of picking up the telephone, but giving users
options can only contribute to the efficiency of the helpdesk.

BRANCHING OUT

In many organisations, the helpdesk is used to route calls and keep
track of who called and with what type of problem. But because most
companies can't dedicate a staff to running the helpdesk, this
entity has started addressing IT-related functions, including asset
management, inventory management, and training administration.

"In the past, asset management might have been under the operations
department and the helpdesk might have been an offshoot of customer
support, but now helpdesk, systems support, asset tracking, and
inventory fall under the same umbrella, and are all under MIS,"
says Bruce Law, executive vice-president of US-based Bultema.
Bultema is an organisation that works with helpdesk and support
vendors to develop business, product, and marketing strategies.

By integrating inventory tracking functionality into a helpdesk
system, IT staff can take calls from users and have immediate
access to each user's desktop environment.

Some helpdesk packages also integrate with change management
applications, which aid in the administration and management of
moves, adds, and changes that can occur after an office move or a
companywide software upgrade. This way, the helpdesk database
always includes information regarding which employee has which
equipment and where they are located.

This integration between the helpdesk and other applications can be
seen in products from all the major helpdesk and support software
vendors in the market. One example is SA-Expert Advisor from
Software Artistry, a problem and call management product that's
part of the company's SA-Expertise suite of automated support
solutions.

The suite contains a variety of modules that users can add as their
needs warrant. These components include an asset management
application, a change management solution, and a component that
integrates the product's support functions with network management
platforms.

Another combination of offerings includes helpdesk software with a
software product that searches for answers to questions or
problems. Utopia Technology Partners' Utopia Resolve/

CBR2 is a joint venture between Utopia, a helpdesk automation
software vendor, and Inference, a provider of software developed to
search and retrieve information in a variety of applications.

The product works with Utopia's HelpDesk to combine problem
resolution and call tracking. Once a call has been logged using
Utopia's HelpDesk, a case-based reasoning session initiates to help
the user solve his or her problem.

Scopus also uses Inference's technology in its CasePoint Link
product, a case-based reasoning module that integrates Inference's
CasePoint search engine and Scopus' products. CasePoint Link
prompts users with a series of questions, the answers to which then
allow the product to search various databases to come up with a
solution.

Clarify's ClearSupport product goes a bit farther by integrating
inventory management with software distribution-an asset for large
enterprise networks with thousands of computers to support and
administer. Clarify's system unites with Microsoft's Systems
Management Server, resulting in a simplified method of distributing
and updating Clarify's helpdesk application. Centralising and
automating software distribution helps lower the cost of running a
helpdesk.

Clarify also features integration with Tivoli System's Tivoli
Management Environment systems management suite. Earlier this year,
Tivoli announced Tivoli/Plus for Clarify, a software module that
integrates Clarify's support product with Tivoli Management
Environment.

DKSystems' DKHelpDesk for Windows includes a project management
feature that tracks the movement of existing equipment and the
installation of new equipment. It also integrates with OnTrack for
Training, the company's training administration and management
software.

In the long run, this integration between the traditional helpdesk
application and various management components can help reduce the
total cost of ownership, which can be important for IT departments
on a lean budget.

Another helpdesk innovation that brings efficiency and possible
lower costs to IT departments is integrating telephony capabilities
into support software. This integration can provide information
about a caller and solutions to prior incidents involving that
caller.

Professional Helpdesk (PHD) announced earlier this year a module
called PHD Automated Attendant, which is built into the company's
PHDEnterprise and PHDPremium helpdesk software products. The
products support Novell's Telephony Services API telephony
standard, which allows PBXs and servers to connect to each other
and pass information back and forth. Helpdesk analysts are able to
instantly obtain information that can help them resolve problems
faster and more efficiently.

Vantive uses a process called database routing, which the company
positions as different from traditional screen pops. "This concept
provides value to the caller, because when someone calls in, the
system asks them for their [telephone] extension, and then it goes
to the database. Depending on the information, the system might put
the caller to the front of the queue, or it might route the call to
the appropriate person," says Bob Tate, vice-president of marketing
at Vantive.

SECOND BEST

Corporations whose primary business is selling products to
customers know the value of an external customer support system. In
fact, many major internal helpdesk software vendors also provide
products that are used primarily for external customer support and
service.

The situation many companies experience is one in which more time,
effort, and funding goes to this external support infrastructure
than to the company's own internal helpdesk. "Clearly there is a
correlation; if you support the external customers well, you gain
revenue benefits," says Scott Webber, president and CEO of Software
Artistry. However, he adds, although the gain in revenue from
outside customers may be more direct, employees are also customers.
"With both internal and external customers, you have issues and
problems that need to be addressed. And if IS doesn't provide
quality support [to the internal customer], the customers have
[other] choices," he says.

Although an internal department may not be viewed as a customer, in
many cases the business unit, for example, does contribute
financially to the IT department. This transfer of funds may be
mostly paper based, but it's a business deal nonetheless. If a
department feels the helpdesk isn't adequately addressing its
needs, it can choose to outsource its support needs, thereby taking
away business-and funds-from the helpdesk.

"With service, you are dealing with one customer at a time and
making sure they are satisfied, whether they are internal or
external," says Bultema's Law. "But the helpdesk is mission
critical in both cases."

Many support software vendors don't see this link, but once they
realise that their own people are crippled, that will change, says
Barbara Noti, senior analyst for application development strategies
at the Meta Group. "As vendors who are leaders in external customer
management also sell to the helpdesk, you'll see people derive the
benefits," she says.

Some in the industry go beyond a relationship between internal and
external customers toward consolidation of the internal helpdesk
with the external customer support infrastructure. "In the past,
you may have had a high-end, robust support solution for external
customers and a lackluster one for internal [customers], but now we
see they are coming together in a centralised approach," says Law.

This merging might be in the form of a support center, under which
any type of support issues can be addressed. With such
consolidation, the internal helpdesk can only benefit because the
external applications usually receive more attention.

STANDARD PROCEDURE

With close to 200 companies developing and shipping helpdesk and
support software, the lack of cohesion in the marketplace is no
surprise. Most helpdesk products are based on proprietary
technology with no established method of communicating with each
other.

One exception may be the support many major vendors have shown
toward manufacturers of knowledge bases. These are products that
load into helpdesk software and contain information about a range
of issues and known problems associated with different hardware and
software products. One example is ServiceWare's Knowl edge-Paks,
which come in versions that cover a variety of systems, including
Microsoft Word, Lotus Notes, NetWare, OS/2, and the World Wide Web.

Helpdesk vendors realise the value of such prepackaged knowledge
bases, and more than a dozen of them have established relationships
with Service Ware to OEM Knowledge-Paks with their own helpdesk
software.

The Molloy Group goes the extra mile and not only repackages
Knowledge-Paks under its own Knowledge Cube line of content
databases, but also modifies the products to work with the
company's Cognitive Processor. The Cognitive Processor is a
technology that enables the company's Top of Mind helpdesk software
to learn from each call that's logged. Upon integration, the
Knowledge Cube databases can make Top of Mind "smarter" about
certain topics.

Other than the support most helpdesk vendors have shown for
ServiceWare, the industry lacks meaningful standards that could
make it easier for helpdesk analysts to share information across
multiple helpdesk platforms and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of support products. To this end, the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF) has announced the Support Management
Working Committee (which is charged with developing a standard for
exchanging electronic service tickets) and a standard that will
outline the content and structure of knowledge used by support
systems.

The Support Management Working Committee is chaired by Patrick
Bultema, president of Bultema and former chair of the US-based
Helpdesk Institute. Bultema found that many CEOs in the support
market were interested in hard-hitting advice about where their
companies should go and how they should position their product
lines. "We look at overall trends in the industry and focus on
innovation and transforming businesses in the area of high-tech
support," Law said.

The current method of exchanging information in helpdesk
troubletickets partly fueled the formation of the committee. When a
user has a problem, he or she calls the internal helpdesk. There,
an analyst generally opens a trouble ticket in which key
information about the call is logged. This ticket remains in the
onsite database, so if the problem is too big for the analyst to
handle and the call is escalated to the systems integrator, the
information can't be readily exchanged. Often, the integrator must
open a new trouble ticket and enter the information all over again.

If the problem is too big even for the integrator and the call is
further escalated to the vendor, the process occurs again. "Each
step you have a person on the telephone creating a service ticket,
with no way of sharing the information and passing it along," Law
said. Many organisations do use e-mail to exchange trouble ticket
information, but that information, unaccompanied by a form
document, doesn't always make sense.

The committee is looking at an Electronic Document Interchange
standard for passing along service ticket data and emphasises that
it is not trying to replace the way service tickets are used.
Rather, it is attempting to define a standard way of moving these
tickets among systems.

This effort will most likely involve creating a common platform for
sending and receiving electronic trouble tickets, a data format for
sending these tickets, and a transport mechanism. Mechanisms under
consideration include e-mail and Internet protocols.

"This standard will allow people to say that even though they have
different systems and different information in their trouble
tickets, at least there is a common way of exchanging this
information," Law said.

Although knowledge bases are very useful when employed in
conjunction with helpdesk software, they are, nonetheless,
generally built on proprietary formats. Support organisations do
have access to vast amounts of knowledge, but exchanging this
knowledge can be cumbersome because there's no standard way to do
it.

The DMTF committee plans to create a standard for content,
structure, and exchange of knowledge, which will make it easier to
share such information among a variety of systems. The standards
committee, which includes vendors such as Astea, Digital, Hewlett-
Packard, IBM, Inference, Intel, and Vantive, plans an aggressive
timetable, with standards slated to be in place by early 1997.

MARKET SHAKE-UP

With the progression of both the standards movement and the effort
to educate customers on the importance of deploying and maintaining
a helpdesk infrastructure, the next step might constitute a major
industry shake-up. In an environment where so many vendors are
vying for a piece of the pie, inevitably some will drop out of the
race, and others will be taken over by larger companies.

In the past year, Astea International acquired Bendata (another
major player in the market) and McAfee took over Vycor. More such
mergers could be in the works, thus reducing the number of
competitors in the support market.

The support industry started out simply tracking calls, it then
moved to identifying who was on the call, then integrating with
problem management and other applications, and finally the industry
moved to sophisti cated knowledge tools that empower end users. But
the industry is still very proprietary, with almost 200 companies
and no market leader.

As long as industry players make the effort to find common ground
and let IT departments know their internal customers are as
important as their external ones, most organisations will be in a
better position to do more with less and still meet their budget
requirements.  LAN

NETWORKS: A Choice of Tech Support Tools

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

What happens when your remote sites go down? What tools do you need
to extract troubleshooting information? Show those techs a thing or
two.

he process of dealing with network troubles seems to unfold in six
stages. Stage one: You realise that something is wrong. Stage two:
You call your VAR. Stage three: Your VAR sends a technician. Stage
four: You describe the problem to your VAR. Stage five: The tech
fixes it. And finally, stage six: Everyone is happy.

The only hard part in this process is stage five. You expect the
proverbial knight in shining armor to arrive on his white horse and
slay the dragon. Instead, here comes the haggard tech-a little
hunched over-with a laptop and a briefcase full of tools, hoping at
least to find the dragon, never mind kill it.

Even when this method is successful-and the so-called dragon is
slain-it still leaves you with a handful of problems. Stages three
through five are expensive. If you employ your VAR via a
maintenance agreement, you're spending money. And the technician
may have actually used your problem to learn something useful. But
the next newbie who faces the same problem will have to start from
ground zero. Anything you can do to minimise the time it takes for
that tech to complete the service call benefits both you.

Several companies offer diagnostic tools that help you find the
fault and perhaps kill the dragon. We'll take a look at some of
them and discuss what you can do in your own office to lower costs
and share knowledge.

Touchstone Software's WINCheckIt helps you examine a PC and
diagnose its maladies. It first examines the hardware on the
machine in question and produces a report. The report contains a
summary of all the devices known to the system. Detailed reports on
IRQ or DMA usage are available.

This program solves two common problems for technicians:
determining from the current environment what add-on hardware is
appropriate and cleaning the drives.

For example, let's say the technician needs to install another
adapter card on the workstation. The "Hardware" icon on the
WINCheckIt taskbar brings up a list of possible cards that might be
added to the machine. The tech chooses a Dialogic voice card;
however, this card cannot be installed in this specific machine due
to IRQ conflicts.

Sometimes, technicians are called in for a problem as simple as
disk space shortage. While WINCheckIt doesn't add capacity, it can
identify waste. The "Clean-up" button on the main screen tells the
program to look for duplicate files throughout the hard disk. Many
of them must remain in place.

For example, every machine has several SETUP.EXE and README.TXT
files, which should be retained. However, files are frequently
copied to create a "temporary" backup, then never deleted. The
cleanup function finds candidates for deletion, so you can clean up
the disk drives. Using this procedure, you can often recover 10 to
15 per cent of a disk's capacity. Of course, making a good,
verified backup before beginning spring cleaning is a smart idea.

Archiving wizard

Another product that helps you recover disk capacity is Synmantec's
Norton Navigator, which has an archiving wizard. It searches the
disk for files older than an administrator-specified date and lists
them. You can then use built-in tools to copy the files elsewhere,
or you can compress them into .ZIP files.

Sometimes, your problem stems from a missing or outdated driver or
module. Various options are available for supplying customers with
such items, and the costs incurred vary with each. Your VAR's
technicians should carry disks of common items, such as the latest
NetWare client software.

If you've standardised all your client configurations as much as
possible (for example, all clients receive SMC Ethernet NICs or
Adaptec SCSI cards), each technician must have a disk or two with
the latest software for these cards. Doing so will solve many of
your problems. Nevertheless, while the tech is at your site,
they're bound to be in need of something they left at their office.
There's a least one easy way to solve that problem.

If your technicians carry modem-equipped laptops with them-always a
sound idea-they shouldn't be caught without Traveling Software's
LapLink. LapLink is available in versions for DOS, Windows 3.x, and
Windows 95. The software connects over serial or parallel
connections as well as over LAN and Internet connections.

They can use LapLink to access files from their office while
they're on the road, but they must first set up a workstation at
the office to run it. The workstation must be logged in to the
server and dialed in to the local Internet access provider. From
their laptop, they can access the Internet and run LapLink to
connect to the LapLink workstation in their office.

To do successfully, they need their office workstation's IP
address. (That address changes every time a new Internet connection
is made.) Make sure the connection doesn't time out if it's idle
for just a few minutes. You also must be able to use telnet
services; some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) require an extra-
cost "shell" account for this purpose.

Once they have the files they need on their laptop, they can attach
the computer to your LAN and use LapLink to make a peer-to-peer
attachment to move the files. If a LAN isn't available, or if the
connections, topology, or protocol are different from what they
have, they can use LapLink in its parallel or serial mode with the
supplied cables. (Parallel mode is about three times faster.) The
parallel cable has male terminators at each end, so it can connect
to the parallel ports of two PCs. There is a handy converter that
changes the Centronix plug found on all common parallel printer
cables to a male, 25-pin, D-Shell connector in most computer
stores. With it, techs can use your printer cable to connect the
PCs.

For a VAR to support you from their site, ask them to try LapLink
Host. Helpdesk staffers can use LapLink Host to take control of
user workstations, allowing them to diagnose and fix problems
remotely.

CD-ROMS TO THE RESCUE

Several CD-ROM titles can help you minimise the time your techs
spend on support calls. The three most popular titles are Micro
House's Micro House Technical Library, Novell's NSEPro, and
Microsoft's TechNet.

Novell's NSEPro has just about everything you'll need to support
NetWare and other Novell products. Think of the NSEPro as a series
of index cards, with some fact, file, or other nugget of
information on each one. Because tens of thousands of cards exist,
they're indexed and searchable electronically. The CD-ROM includes
all the files available from Novell's ftp site (ftp://novell.com)
and NetWire (Novell's CompuServe presence); the CD-ROM is published
eight to 10 times a year.

The Micro House Technical Library, updated quarterly, is a CD-ROM
encyclopedia containing information on NICs, system boards, hard
disk drives, and controllers. Its entries include graphics and
tables. You'll find this tool extremely useful in researching how
to set up hardware. If you have ever found yourself holding a
controller card, NIC, or motherboard without the accompanying
manual, this tool is a welcome solution.

The Technical Library is available in a network version (sold with
licenses that allow various numbers of concurrent users) and a
standalone version. Running the latter requires that a hardware
switch, called a dongle, to be attached to the parallel port of a
user's workstation. This stipulation is an annoying inconvenience,
but the value of the information outweighs it.

Microsoft's TechNet is also a two-disk set. Each monthly update
contains over 150,000 pages of current technical information, along
with the latest drivers and patches. It covers topics such as
client-server and workgroup computing, system platforms, database
products, and Windows and Macintosh applications. TechNet even
includes the entire Microsoft Knowledge Base, with over 50,000
questions and answers. The CD-ROM uses a Windows-based, full-text
search engine. Information is displayed in a scrollable,
prioritised list, and you can place electronic bookmarks in the
text, annotate topics of interest, and print directly from the
screen.

While you're loading up the CD-ROM server, throw on a copy of the
Windows 95 CD-ROM. After installing new hardware, you'll often be
asked for a file or two from that CD-ROM. Ask if your tech has a
copy, so that there is one permanently in his briefcase. With
LapLink, you can make all that information easily accessible. With
your LAN, use NETSETUP from the CD-ROM to make a Win95 directory on
the server. Doing so lets your own staff without CD-ROM drives
access those files easily.

STAY OUT OF TROUBLE

The last thing you want to happen is for an infection from another
of your VAR's customers to pass from the tech's laptop to your
workstations. You should run a server-based virus scanner such as
NetShield from McAfee. In addition, you should have a variety of
up-to-date scanners and disinfectors to test and clean infected
stations. Check the National Computer Security Association's (NCSA)
forum on CompuServe or the Computer Security Institute's (CSI) Web
site (http://www.gocsi.com) for a wide variety of products from
anti-virus program (AVP) vendors.

You should also get into the habit of using write-protected
floppies. If your VAR's techs are equipped with laptops, they
should be running a shield program at all times-no exceptions.
Remember, if they infect you, they have to spend a lot of non-
billable hours cleaning your systems.

HELP YOURSELF TO A HELPDESK

Many VARs contract with their customers to provide technical
support. In a large organisation, this service is called the
helpdesk. Smaller companies focusing on their business rather than
the technology that manages it often want to outsource their
helpdesk needs.

VARs are well positioned to support a dozen or a hundred clients,
just as a corporate helpdesk can support anywhere from a few to
numerous users and departments.

I believe that the ideal helpdesk hasn't been written, although
several have potential. If your organisation is large enough, I do
know that with a combination of products, you can build a helpdesk
that comes close to perfection.

Start with the core helpdesk software, One example is McAfee's DP
Umbrella. (This product was developed by Vicor, which was later
bought by McAfee.) In addition to the traditional helpdesk
functions such as tracking open items, escalation, and reporting,
DP Umbrella has several built-in features and add-ons. The Help
Desk Monitor is one of them, and it provides technicians a place to
log new calls. It automatically prevents duplicate entries of the
same problem by one caller (for example, if the caller has already
reported it).

If another user reports the same problem, the software adds that
call to the count of pending calls; when a solution is found, it
can be distributed to all users who suffer from that particular
problem.

Another built-in feature is called the White Board. Through it,
operators post messages about situations that may affect several
end users. All calls relating to a posted White Board notice are
linked together; they can be worked on, updated, and resolved
simultaneously. This collaborative computing tool lets technicians
learn from each other.

More importantly, it prevents several of your own techs from
working on the same problem at the same time in an uncoordinated
manner.

Among the DP Umbrella add-ons is Vicor Web. This tool lets the
helpdesk post common problems and solutions to an Internet or
internet Web site, so users can find their own solutions. This
feature can dramatically reduce the number of calls individual
technicians must handle, which cuts the cost of staffing and
managing the helpdesk. You can track helpdesk calls for reporting
purposes, and you can restrict access to various parts of the Web
site based on security clearances (or support levels). For example,
if your office has no oher technician on staff, you can get minimal
information, such as how to change printer ribbons, while your
offices with more savvy users can access updated drivers or other
files.

Another add-on product to DP Umbrella is Vicor listener, which
monitors network management consoles via its Simple Mail Transport
Protocol (SMTP) Listener. The software receives SNMP messages from
any system capable of e-mailing them, letting the helpdesk staff
act proactively to manage a problem before it becomes a crisis.

If you need to standardise management information, American
Megatrends recently introduced PC Care. This product fully exploits
the DMI technology supported by most BIOS vendors to offer
standardised system information.

PC Care collects information stored in the BIOS and puts it into a
standardised Management Information File (MIF) format. The program
then interprets DMI data into one of several formats, which an then
be converted to SMTP messages and sent to Vicor Listener.

In this process, problems brewing in one user's PC can be brought
to the attention of the helpdesk staff before the user even knows a
problem exists. These problems can be resolved in a planned,
scheduled manner rather than in crisis mode.

Few helpdesk products include inventory management and purchasing,
but I believe the Vicor product and Open UPTIME from Metrix do-and
do so quite well.

The Metrix product includes purchasing system and replenishment
capabilities, and it maintains a complete history record on parts
and products shipped (including serial-number tracking). It has an
add-on module called the Repair Center, which ties in a service
depot function so authorised materials can be repaired while
recording information for parts and labor billing.

The basis for receiving technical support is being prepared when
you do find a problem on your network. These tips and tools will
help you and your VAR's techs resolve the problem at hand and avoid
crisis situations.  LAN

NETWORKS: RUNNING YOUR OWN DNS

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

As your network grows, you may be considering the option of running
your own Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

We show you how to navigate the DNS structure.

ll hosts on the Internet- or on any TCP/IP network for that matter-
have an assigned 32-bit IP address. In addition, most hosts also
have a name, because names are easier to remember than addresses.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the distributed database that
contains the names and addresses of all reachable hosts on a TCP/IP
subnet, including the Internet.

Most, but not all, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will set up
and maintain the DNS information for their customers. However, you
may prefer to operate your own DNS. Let's take a look at Internet
domain names and the DNS's structure and discuss how you can create
and maintain the DNS information.

INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES AND STRUCTURE

Internet host names use a hierarchical address structure that
comprises a top-level domain, a subdomain, and a host name. Top-
level domain names and IP network addresses are assigned and
maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA, USC
Information Sciences Institute), which is responsible for the DNS's
overall coordination and management. Domain administrators assign
host names and addresses within their domain. (For more information
on the IANA, contact its Web site at http://www/isi/edu/diz7/iana.)

The Internet naming hierarchy is best understood by reading a host
name from right to left. All host names end with a top-level domain
name (see Figure 1). Generic top-level domains (although generally
limited to the US) include the following: com (commercial
organisations), edu (educational institutions, primarily four-year
colleagues and universities), gov (US government agencies), mil (US
military), org (nonprofit organisations), net (network providers),
and int (international treaty organisations).

The host name smcvax.smcvt.edu, for example, is assigned to a VAX
computer (smcvax) within St. Michael's College's subdomain (smcvt),
which is within the educational top-level domain (edu). The name
golem.bill.com refers to a host (golem) in the Hill Associates
(Colchester, VT) subdomain (hill) within the commercial top-level
domain (com).

Other top-level domain names use international two-letter country
codes, such as au (Australia), ca (Canada), de (Germany), es
(Spain), fr (France), jp (Japan), mx (Mexico), and us (United
States). Each country determines its own countrybased subdomains
and how the associated DNS database will be organised.

The US domain, for example, is organised mostly on the basis of
geography, usually using a name with the following format:
organisation.city.state.us. The format may be slightly different
for special names, such as those for state government or K-12 and
two-year educational institutions. The address cnri.reston.va.us,
for example, refers to the Corporation for National Research
Initiatives located in the US.

The ca subdomain within the us high-level domain does not cause a
conflict with the ca high-level domain; the former refers to
California and the latter to Canada. The host name

myo.inst.keio.ac.jp refers to a system at the Science and
Technology Department of Keio University in Yokohama, Japan; note
that the ac subdomain within jp refers to academic institutions.

THE NAMING PROBLEM

Because host names are easier to remember than IP addresses, using
them is a convenience for the humans who use the network. However,
the network has to provide some sort of name-address translation in
order to operate.

Prior to the definition of the DNS, the HOSTS.TXT file was used in
the ARPAnet. It contained the IP address, name, and alias(es) of
every host on the ARPAnet. This scheme was suitable when the
network had only a few hundred systems and was not very dynamic.
But, it is wholly unsuited for the Internet, which has almost 10
million hosts (as of January 1996) and 10 percent growth per month.

HOSTS.TXT files are still used, however. Their main function today
is to contain the names of local systems, so one machine on a LAN
(or other local network) can find other local systems without
performing a DNS lookup.

When TCP/IP software is configured on a host, the location of the
HOSTS.TXT file must be provided if the file is used by a given
system.

Figure 2 illustrates a fictitious network: the foo.com domain.
Listing 1 shows a sample HOSTS.TXT file for this domain. Each line
contains three fields: the IP address, host name, and (optionally)
any aliases the system might use. For example, a system on the LAN
trying to make an frp connection to the local ftp server might
attempt to open a connection to 192.168.210.3, ftp.foo.com, ftp,
www, mail2, or dns2.

THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

The DNS is a distributed database containing the names and/or
addresses of every host accessible via the Internet. The DNS was
one of the key developments that allowed the Internet to grow as it
has. Unlike HOSTS.TXT files, which must be maintained individually
at every host on the network and synchronised to ensure their
correctness, DNS files are maintained by thousands of hosts on the
network. Each host is responsible for a portion of the name space,
which is called a zone. The DNS provides a mechanism for
identifying backup databases in case the first one becomes
unavailable. DNS databases are updated automatically, so
information on one name server does not remain out-of-date for
long.

When TCP/IP software is installed on a host, the address (not the
names) of one or more name servers (usually no more than three) are
one of the configured parameters. When the host attempts to
establish a connection to another IP host, it first checks its
local HOSTS.TXT file (if there is one) for the name of the remote
host. If the remote host is not the HOSTS.TXT file, the local host
sends a query to the primary DNS name server. The primary name
server might not contain the information about the particular
destination host; in that case, the query is forwarded to another
name server higher up on the domain name hierarchy.

Consider the following example. Suppose a user on a system at Baz
University (domain: baz.edu) wishes to initiate a connection to the
Web server at Foo Corp. (www. foo.com). The following name
resolution steps would occur:

1. The Baz host checks its HOSTS.

TXT file. In this example, Foo's Web server is not found.

2. The Baz host then checks its primary DNS name server. Because
the Baz DNS server probably covers only the baz.edu zone, it does
not contain Foo's Web server address; instead, it forwards the
query.

3. The query is passed to a name server higher up in the DNS
hierarchy. A database exists for every top-level domain. The
database contains the name of every sub-domain within that top-
level domain and its assigned name server(s). When the higher-level
name server checks the com DNS file, it finds an entry for foo.com
and the address of its DNS server(s). This information is returned
to the Baz DNS server.

4. The query is then forwarded to one of the name servers for
foo.com, which, in turn, returns the IP address of the Web server
(198.168.210.3).

You can use several TCP/IP tools to examine the DNS. The most
common DNS lookup utilities are NSLOOKUP and Host. If you turn off
the "recursive" option, you can see these steps in more detail.

The DNS database contains different types of information on
resource records (RR). Following are descriptions of the most
common RRs.

Start of Authority (SOA) records indicate the authoritative name
server for a given domain and a few additional administrative
items.

Address (A) records supply the IP address for a given host name.

Canonical Name (CNAME) records supply host alias names. You can
define multiple A records for a given address, providing alias, or
alternate, host names. It is usually easier (and less prone to
human error) to supply one A record for a given address and use
CNAME records to define alias host names for that address.

Pointer Records (PTR) associate a host name with a given IP
address. These records are used for reverse name lookups.

Mail Exchange (MX) records define the mail system(s) for a given
domain.

Name Server (NS) records define the name server(s) for a given
domain.

DNS SERVER SOFTWARE

DNS server software has various names, depending on the operating
system. Windows NT refers simply to DNS, while Unix has named or
Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND) boot files. When the DNS
process is launched, it will read a boot file that contains the
names of the database files containing the DNS information. Listing
2 shows a sample boot file, called named.boot.

The first record in the boot file contains directory information
and points to the directory where the DNS program files reside.
Each remaining record contains three fields that describe a DNS
database file: the type of DNS information, the domain defined in
the file, and the file name. The six records listed refer to the
DNS databases that this DNS server is primarily responsible for.
The six domains defined here are:

foo.com: The DNS entries for the foo.com zone, which contain
address, mail server, and name server RRs, are found in the file
foo.com.zone.

210.168.192.in-addr.arpa: The foo.

com domain is associated with the IP Class C address 192.168.210.0
(a valid IP address for use in a private network per RFC 1918).
Reverse lookups (obtaining the host name from an IP address) are
accomplished using a reverse database file. In this file, the name
of the domain is the reverse dotted decimal notation of the
domain's IP address followed by in-addr.arpa. (The latter is an
indication of the use of IP addressed within the ARPA address
assignment domain. This nomenclature is an historic holdover from a
time when more than one type of address could be found and more
than one addressing authority existed.) The file containing this
data is called foo.com.rev.

localhost: Localhost is a special IP name that always refers to the
local host and, by convention, has the Ip address 127.0.0.1. This
information is located in the file called localhost.zone.

0.0.127.in-addr.arpa: IP reserves the Class A address 127.0.0.0 for
local loopback. This address, therefore, is not maintained by any
global DNS registry. For completeness and security, we define the
reverse lookup for this address in a file called localhost.rev.

O.in-addr.arpa and 255.in-addr.arpa: IP reserves the all-zeros (0)
and all-ones (255) addresses for special purposes. These domains
are defined in all the all-zero.zone and the all-one.zone files,
respectively.

The final record defines where to find the DNS cache information
for the root domain (.). This is not a cache as in short-term
memory, but rather a set of fixed pointers to the higher-level DNS
databases. In this example, the cache information is maintained in
the file named.cache.

DNS RECORD FORMATS AND DATABASE FILES

All DNS resource records have a similar format. Although you can
find many shortcut notations and abbreviations in DNS files, I have
used examples with simple nomenclature to eliminate confusion and
ambiguity.

The first field in any DNS record is always either an IP address or
a host name. If this entry is missing, the name/address from the
previous record is implied. Note that all names and addresses end
with a trailing dot (.), which signifies that the name or address
is an absolute name/address rather than a relative one. Absolute
addresses, also called fully qualified domain names, are relative
to the root, while relative addresses are relative to a default
domain (which may or may not be the root). This field may,
optionally, be followed by a time-to-live (TTL) value, which
indicates the length of time the field's information field should
be considered valid.

The second field indicates the address type. In today's DNS
databases, the string "IN" most likely indicates an Internet
address. This field is present for historical purposes and enables
compatibility with older systems. The third field is a string that
indicates the type of RR. This field is followed by optional
parameters specific to the RR.

The foo.com.zone file, shown in Listing 3, contains information
about the foo.com domain, including name lookup, mail exchange, and
name server information. Specific RRs of note follow.

Notable rrs

The SOA record includes the name of the DNS server system and the
e-mail address of the person responsible for the name server. Note
that the e-mail address is not in the expected form; rather than
user@domain, the format user.domain is used. This record also
contains five other parameters.

1. The serial number identified the version of the DNS database.
Whenever the file's information is changed, the serial number must
be incremented so secondary servers examining this database know
the information has been altered. In this example, we use a serial
number format containing the year (all four digits), month, and day
of the last update. This numbering scheme is usually sufficient if
you don't change your DNS database more than once a day. Some
systems just start counting at 1 and increment it every time a
change occurs.

2. The refresh value tells the secondary name server(s) how often
to check for updated information (10,800 seconds is three hours).

3. If the secondary name server is unable to contact the primary
name server, it continues its attempt to make a connection at the
specified retry intervals. In this example, it will try once every
3,600 seconds, or every hours.

4. If a secondary name server cannot contact the primary name
server within the specified expire period, the secondary server
stops answering queries about this domain. The theory behind this
parameter is that at some point, the data is so old it might be
harmful-no answer is better than a bad answer. In this case, the
time period 604,800 seconds is one week.

5. The TTL value is returned with all responses to database
queries. It tells the requester (or other servers) how long the
information can safely be cached (86,400 seconds is one day). The
TTL value is the default value for all records in the file, it may
be overridden by a TTL value provided with a given RR.

NS records contain the address of the name server(s) for this
domain. In this example, two name servers have the foo.com DNS
information.

MX records contain the addresses of the mail exchange system(s) for
this domain. The number before the address is the preferred system.
When a remote user sends mail to user@foo.com, the remote mail
system looks up the MX record for the foo.com domain. the remote
mailer then attempts to establish an SMTP connection to the foo.com
mail system with the lowest preference value (in this case,
mail.foo.com). If that system is not available, the remote mailer
tries the next level mailer (in this case mail2.foo.com).

The A records contain the IP address associated with the host name
in the first field of the record.

The CNAME records contain the alias host names associated with the
host named in the first field of the record. Although you can
assign a single A record and many CNAME records to a single system,
be careful when doing so. Some mailers, for example, do
unpredictable things when asked to resolve an MX host name that
uses a CNAME record rather than an explicit A record. In the
following examples, the addresses of the backup DNS and mail
servers are specified with separate A records, even though they
point to the same machine.

GOING IN REVERSE

The database file for the IP address domain handles the reverse
lookups.

The records and their formats are essentially the same as those in
the previous examples, except that PTR records are used instead of
A records. PTR records contain a host name to associate with the IP
address that is in the first field of the record. The foo.com.rev
file that corresponds to the foo.com network is shown in Listing 4.

Listings 5 and 6 show sample localhost.zone and localhost.rev
files, respectively, providing forward and reverse address lookups
for the loopback address. Listings 7 and 8 show sample files for
the all-zeros and all-ones addresses. These files are provided only
for completeness and security.

Finally, if the local name server cannot resolve a name, the query
is forwarded to a name server higher up on the domain name tree.
The named.

cache file contains the addresses of the top-level DNS servers. You
should periodically download this file from the Internet Network
Information Center (InterNIC) at
ftp://rs.internic..net/domain/named.cache. (This file
is also called named.root and named.
ca.) Listing 9 shows an abbreviated version of the current
named.cache file. The single dot (.) indicates the root domain; the
"3600000" is the TTL value, indicating that these entries should
expire after about six weeks (3.6 million seconds).

WHY MAINTAIN YOUR OWN DNS?

If most ISPs are willing to maintain a DNS for their customers, why
would a company or organisation consider operating its own? The
most obvious and pressing reason is that not all ISPs will provide
this service.

However, even if the service is available, a site might want to run
its own DNS for other reasons. One might be to have more control
and to ensure the database's accuracy. If you constantly move
systems around, change host names, and/or changes IP addresses,
your ISP may not keep the DNS as up-to-date as you would like-or
need it to be.

Another issue is reverse name mapping; some ISPs keep reverse name
information only for servers-not the individual host systems. In
this case, users may not be able to connect to ftp or other
information servers that attempt to reconcile the user's host name
with the IP address. Furthermore, as your site grows in size and
complexity, your ISP may be unable to meet your needs.

AND THAT'S NOT ALL

Running a DNS is not terribly hard, but you must be careful when
creating the databases. You must update the DNS files whenever a
system name or address change is made. The serial number

must be appropriately updated whenever you make a change. The most
up-to-date named.cache file must be periodically downloaded from
the InterNIC. You also have to manage zone transfers, which is the
procedure for moving DNS data between primary and secondary name
servers. These procedures require planning. The example used in
this article is a simple case of a small LAN attached tothe
Internet. If you understand the DNS, you can manage your servers;
this way, you know the servers will be up-do-date.  LAN

NETWORKS: Performance Grading Gets Four Stars

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Microtest, in cooperation with industry leaders, introduced the
concept of performance grading-as opposed to simply identifying
pass or fail conditions-to provide a more accurate assessment of
the quality of Category 5 links. In the past, it seemed acceptable
to only know if a link passed or not. If you got a green light, you
considered the link to be OK.

A simple passing indicator was acceptable because different cables
appeared to have fairly equal performance factors. In fact, TSB-67
had been written with this binary form of testing in mind. Today,
however, the performance of Category 5 cables varies widely,
especially if you buy cable from more than one vendor. For example,
you may find that one vendor's cable barely passes TSB-67
requirements, while another vendor's cable tests the signal-to-
noise ratio 60 times better.

Performance grading has several advantages. For one, users can
differentiate marginally compliant links from superior links. This
ability helps identify those links that offer longer life and lower
transmission error rates and that support higher-speed
applications. Also, you can measure the product's quality, assuming
you obtain the cable from the same supplier (that is, the cables'
performance factors are approximately the same). Such data can help
you evaluate whether your cable installation team will need more
training before the next job.

Performance grading rates the quality of Category 5 links that pass
in terms of near-end crosstalk (NEXT). The idea here, similar to
standard NEXT tests, is to measure the amount of NEXT at a variety
of frequencies within the cable's operating bandwidth. The
difference is that the performance grade is based on a range of
acceptable NEXT values (in decibels) at each frequency.

As shown in the figure, Microtest divides the range of acceptable
NEXT values into seven quality bands, each 3 dB apart at the 100
MHz end of the spectrum. This tester indicates whether the link
passes, as well as the quality band within which it operates. For
example, a cable exhibiting performance shown in the figure would
pass at quality band three. If you're interested in upgrading your
existing PentaScanner to include performance grading, Microtest
offers the PentaScanner 350 upgrade kit.  LAN

NETWORKS: Reading the Cable Meter

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

A lot can go wrong beneath the casings of your network's coiled
connectors. Peek into your cabling infrastructure using these cable
testing techniques.

Did you ever take your car in for major transmission or carburetor
work, only to have the mechanic point out the belts showing through
what's left of your tires' tread? When dealing with a complex
system, it is sometimes the simplest component that we tend to
neglect. But when those components fail, the effect on the system
as a whole can be as devastating as a major component failure.

Network cabling provides a medium for the transport of data among
users, servers, printers, switches, and routers within your
network. Any cable that isn't contributing to the flow of data will
seriously degrade or even halt your network operations.

Inadequate cabling is one of the most common causes of network
problems, so don't take your cabling infrastructure for granted.
Cabling requires the same kind of careful troubleshooting,
monitoring, and maintenance routines that you implement for your
network's other systems. Not utilising preventive testing and
effective troubleshooting procedures on your cabling will
eventually backfire on you. The results of such neglect will
certainly give you migraines and probably make you wish you had
chosen a different line of work.

How do you ensure that your cables are installed properly and not
the cause of any network glitches? Whether you're checking a recent
implementation or trying to fix a problem on an operational
network, a cable tester is the most ef fective tool for certifying
whether the network's wiring is capable of transmitting data
successfully. The proper implementation of proactive testing using
a cable tester helps minimise network downtime and eliminates a
great deal of stress when cable problems do arise.

WHERE IT HAPPENS

Cable testing takes place within the Physical layer of the OSI
reference model. The Physical layer defines the transmission of
bits through a medium, and standards at this layer specify the
electrical characteristics of the signal, cable, and connector pin-
outs. As you know, the most written-about cable types today is
Category 5 UTP wiring, which supports the 100 Mbps data traffic
found in networks running on protocols such as Ethernet, Fast
Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI.

Most cable testers, such as Fluke's DSP-100, run tests to certify
whether a Category 5 cable installation meets the requirements for
passing data. Testers are available that allow you to test other
cabling media, such as multimode and single-mode optical fibre and
thin and thick wire coaxial cable. However, if you need to test at
layers above the Physical layer, such as the Data-link layer or
higher, you'll need a protocol analyser.

When should you perform cable testing? The obvious answer is when
users begin to experience problems, but that type of reactive
problem-solving is not desirable, especially for cable testing. Any
cable testing procedure you attempt after problems have already
occurred will certainly be pressured and stressful. And even so,
users will often have to wait until you fix the problem before they
can return to work.

Sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however. When you find
yourself under the gun to restore the network's functionality due
to an emerging problem, such as slow or no response from network
resources, your first step should be to utilise your network
management software or protocol analyser to determine the part of
the network that is at fault. If the cabling and connectors are
identified as the culprits, a high-quality cable tester and knowing
how to use it will prove invaluable.

By far, the best time to test your cables is immediately after
they've been installed. This proactive testing philosophy will pay
off by minimising problems that could plague your network in the
future and by making the process a more pleasant experience for
you. Concentrate on testing before problems occur-not only once the
installation is complete, but periodically, as well. Preventive
maintenance is your greatest ally against network problems of any
kind. The result will be a more reliable network and much happier
and productive users.

COMMON CABLE FAULTS

It's worth repeating that cabling problems rank very high as the
cause of networking troubles. Mechanical elements, such as cabling,
connectors, and wall plates, tend to fail more often than active
electronic devices such as network adapters and switches. It's also
much easier to make unnoticeable mistakes when installing wiring
and connectors. Thus, if you're experiencing connection problems or
excessive delay, there's a good chance the cabling infrastructure
is at fault.

Of those problems that do stem from cabling and connectors,
approximately 85 per cent are caused by a faulty installation, not
from product defects. Cable installation errors come in all forms.
For example, a technician working on the corporate telephone system
could accidentally snip a network cable, or a cable installer could
improperly attach a connector to the cable or exceed distance
limitations for a particular cable run. These errors may have a
large or small effect on the network, depending on which user or
server cable was cut or improperly installed.

Intermittent problems are generally caused by improper splices,
poor connector attachments, lack of termination, and corrosion. A
cable will maximally transfer the energy of a data signal as long
as the impedance within the cable remains constant. However, a
signal encountering a sharp change in impedance will produce
reflections. Reflections occur when a signal is reflected in the
direction from which it came, causing a potential collision with
itself or another signal.

Reflection occurs most often when there is lack of termination on
the cable. Cable terminators are there to absorb the power and
dissipate it as heat, making the cable seem infinitely long to the
traveling signal. If a terminator is missing, a signal will reach
the end of the cable and be met with a difference in impedance in
the air that surrounds the cable's exposed end, causing a
reflection. In addition to lack of termination, improper splices
and poor connector attachments may cause reflections.

Cabling ailments can also cause excessive attenuation, decreasing
the amount of signal power that reaches the receiving device. This
situation causes the signal-to-noise ratio to decrease, leading to
greater transmission errors.

In very few instances, the cable you buy may not meet
specifications. Even if you buy from a reputable vendor, there is
that chance that the cable you've purchased has severe
imperfections. Therefore, you should make it a habit to test the
cable before installation.

CABLE TEST LINEUP

Before you purchase or utilise a cable tester, you should
understand what they can do. First of all, cable testing is
intrusive, meaning you can't support normal data traffic over the
cable while running tests. Of course, if you're in the middle of
implementing the cable plant, there won't yet be any users. But, if
you're troubleshooting an active cable segment, you will have to
bring down the cable on which you are working. Lastly, and more
importantly, cable testers that comply with the Technical Services
Bulletin (TSB) -67 standard, which was approved in October 1995 by
the EIA/TIA 568A committee, perform a series of four tests to
ensure your cable installation is adequate.

These tests are: Wire map, link length, attenuation, and near-end
crosstalk (NEXT). A new offshoot of cable testing, performance
grading, may be of help, as well (see "Performance Grading Gets
Four Stars").

The wire map test ensures that a link has proper connectivity by
testing for continuity and other installation errors. Continuity
tests verify that the wire is not broken and that physical
connectivity exists throughout the connectors and cabling. Thus,
the wire map test will tell you if, as in our previous example,
someone accidentally cut the cable. Sometimes during installation
the installer may inadvertently fail to connect the wires on one
connector pin to the corresponding pin on the opposite end of the
cable. This, of course, will not facilitate a connection-the wire
map test verifies proper pairing of wiring on opposite ends of the
cable.

The twisting of wires in UTP minimises induction of current flow
from other devices that may be emanating electromagnetic waves,
such as nearby wires. A Category 5 cable includes four individually
twisted pairs of wires. If you don't wire your RJ-45 connectors
exactly according to a standard, such as EIA/TIA 568A, T568A or
T568B wiring scheme, then you may produce split pairs. A split pair
occurs when you attach the connector in such a way that a wire pair
consists of one lead from one twisted pair and another lead from a
different twisted pair, creating a pair of wires that are
untwisted. The split pair configuration provides a path for data to
flow, but problems can occur. Of issue is the resulting untwisted
wire pair, which will encounter an excessive amount of external
noise interference and crosstalk, causing transmission errors.
Cable testers do a good job of detecting the existence of split
pairs.

Link length measurement tests tell you whether the cable meets the
length requirements specified by the T568B cabling standard. Cable
testers use a device called a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to
determine the length of a cable. The TDR also indicates if there
are any improper cable splices or terminations.

As shown in Figure 1 (page 54), The TDR tests cables based on the
principle of reflections. The TDR connects to an end of a cable the
technician wishes to test, then sends a signal throughout the
cable. This signal reflects off changes in impedance, especially at
the end of the cable, and the amplitude of the reflected wave
corresponds to the degree of impedance mismatch.

The TDR records the amount of time between the test signal's
departure and its return, which constitutes the signal delay. It
then calculates the distance to the reflecting point based on the
speed of the signal and signal delay.

Several products on the market today run TDR tests on metallic or
fibre optic cable. For example, the Tektronix TS100 Option 01
Metallic TDR tests LocalTalk; Type 1 and Type 3 cables; Category 3,
4, and 5 cables; and thin and thick coax cables. This test set
finds shorts, ends, and breaks in the cable. The Tektronix TFP2A
Fibermaster Optical TDR (OTDR) tests single-mode and multimode
fibre optic cables.

A data signal loses power while traversing the length of a cable.
This loss of power is called attenuation. For metallic and fibre
cabling, attenuation increases linearly as a function of cable
length. However, radio signal attenuation increases exponentially
with greater distances. If too much attenuation is present between
source and destination, electrical noise becomes significant and
transmission errors will occur more frequently. Attenuation tests
help you identify problems such as manufacturing defects and
corrosion.

Many LANs, including Ethernet and Token Ring, utilise digital
signals to carry information among network devices. A digital
signal contains a series of discrete voltage levels that represent
the 1s and 0s of the data signal. In the time domain, which you can
render visually with an oscilloscope, a digital signal appears to
contain only DC (0 Hz) characteristics, such as positive 5 volts
for a logic 1 and negative 5 volts for a logic 0. However, a
digital signal's sharp changes of amplitude cause the signal to
contain very high frequency components. You can observe this effect
by viewing the signal's frequency characteristics on a spectrum
analyser.

In addition to cable length, the amount of attenuation is also a
function of frequency. Most cables will offer more attenuation to
higher frequency signals than to lower frequency signals. Thus,
cabling acts as a low pass filter, smoothing out the sharp edges of
the digital signal.

Cable testers examine attenuation by measuring the effects of
sending a series of signals that step through the cable's operating
frequency bandwidth. For Category 5 testing, most cable testers
cover bandwidth ranging from 1 MHz to 100 MHz by taking readings in
1 MHz increments. This process certifies whether the cable meets
specifications in the part of the frequency spectrum where the
signal mostly resides. For Category 3 links, the frequency test
range is 1 MHz through 16 MHz.

The cable tester will report a passing grade if all frequencies
pass specifications. If a cable fails, the tester will tell you the
frequency at which it didn't meet requirements. Some testers also
indicate the amount of attenuation per foot. Cable testers are
available that work with metallic or fibre cable. For example,
Microtest's PentaScanner measures attenuation (as well as many
other impairments) on Category 3, 4, and 5 cable, and AMP's AM9100
tests single-mode, multimode, and plastic fibre cables for
attenuation.

NEXT is a specific case in which signals at one end of the link
interfere with weaker signals that are coming back from the
recipient. Current flow resulting from the difference of potential
impressed by the data signal consists of electrons that move
through a metallic wire. This stream of electrons creates an
electromagnetic field around the wire that may induce the flow of
electrons in an adjacent wire. This crossing of the signal into a
different wire is called crosstalk.

You may have experienced voice signal crosstalk while talking on
the telephone, probably in the form of another audible con
versation occurring during a telephone call. Sometimes crosstalk
occurs if you add a telephone line to your home and utilise both
telephones at the same time. The close proximity of the wire pairs
allows the signals to cross.

Causes of crosstalk generally include improper wire placement and
inadequate shielding. The twisting of wire, as is the case with UTP
cable, offers some resistance to crosstalk and other interfering
signals. Shielded twisted pair and coaxial cable offer a further
degree of protection. But fibre optic cable is completely immune to
crosstalk because fibre uses light rather than current flow to
transport the data. The flow of light through the fibre's core does
not produce an electromagnetic field that couples to nearby fibres.

In addition to crosstalk, networks may encounter the induction of
external electrical noise. This noise can become significant in
relation to the signal power, setting up the potential for errors.
The noise that causes these problems within network cabling is
usually Gaussian or impulse noise. Gaussian noise has nearly
uniform amplitude across the frequency spectrum and primarily
results from thermal conditions in the atmosphere. Impulse noise,
though, is typically the outcome of human-made devices such as
light switches, spark plugs, and heating coils. Impulse noise
typically occurs in short blasts, causing transmission errors to
occur in bursts. As with crosstalk, external noise produces an
electromagnetic field that causes unwanted currents to flow through
metallic data cables.

The amount of NEXT varies erratically as you sweep through the
operating bandwidth of a cable. For an accurate measurement, cable
testers record NEXT by stepping though the cable's operating
frequency range at very small increments. For Category 5 cable,
TSB-67 recommends a maximum step sise of 0.15 MHz for lower
frequencies and 0.25 MHz for higher frequencies within the 1 MHz
through 100 MHz frequency range. It requires a fast instrument to
test the hundreds of samples.

Fluke's DSP-100 handheld cable tester is a fast performer of NEXT
tests. The DSP-100 utilises digital signal processing to increase
its speed and to allow samples to be taken at close 100 KHz
intervals. The DSP-100 performs all tests required by TSB-67 for a
four-pair cable in under 20 seconds. This tester not only
identifies the presence of crosstalk, it also locates its source.

SKEWING THE DATA

The use of plenum cable continues to grow. However, there has been
a shortage of the Teflon that manufacturers use as a protective
cable coating. As a result, cable manufacturers now use a non-
Teflon coating on one or two of the four pairs in Category 5 cable.
These cables are known as "3+1" or "2+2" cables. These cables fully
meet Category 5 crosstalk and attenuation requirements, but the
difference in coatings offer unacceptable skew. Skew is the maximum
difference in propagation delay between the pair in a cable.

According to a white paper developed by Microtest, the use of 3+1
and 2+2 cables makes it vitally important that your cable tester
measure skew to avoid inaccurate length measurements and other
troubles. Because cable testers base the length calculation on
delay, the skew will introduce a range of lengths. For example, a
tester may report lengths 97, 97, 99, and 108 metres for each of
the four pairs of a 3+1 cable.

The problem of skew is more significant than simply causing some
bizarre length readings. Several high-speed LAN technologies, such
as 100Base-T4 and 100VG-AnyLAN, employ all four pairs of the
Category 5 cable. These schemes disassemble the signal into several
parts, send them down separate pairs, then reassemble the signal at
the far end. These standards expect each part of the signal to
arrive at the distant end at about the same time. However, if one
part of the signal leads or lags the others by too much, the
receive buffer cannot keep up with information transfer.

The 100Base-T4 skew requirement is a maximum of 50 nanoseconds;
however, some experts suggest a skew of no more than 35
nanoseconds. The TIA is expected to incorporate skew test standards
within a year. Today, Microtest provides upgrades to users of their
tester, PentaScanner, free of charge to include the capability to
measure skew.

A cable tester is a requirement to effectively implement and
maintain your network.

If you don't already have one, you should add a cable tester to
your toolbox. As with all network troubleshooting, the key is to be
proactive in testing to avoid problems cropping up at inopportune
times.  LAN

NETWORKS: Fault-Tolerance and Fault-Resilience

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

How tolerant are your networks? How much downtime can you really
afford? Don't live in a glass house: Here are several products and
strategies that improve network integrity.

100 per cent fault-tolerant network is a goal that can be
approached but never achieved. According to a white paper from
Vinca, a developer of fault-protection technology, "Downtime costs
are significant. The typical PC LAN is unavailable to all users 1.6
hours per week. In a 300-user network, this downtime costs
US$840,000 per year in productivity losses." Network Integrity,
another manufacturer of fault-resilient server software, estimates
the cost of a single server's downtime to be in the range of
US$50,000 to US$170,000 per year.

Today, networks are supporting a greater number of mission-critical
applications such as international financial arbitrage
transactions, where any downtime can cost millions of dollars.

GIVE 'EM THE RAS

Today, a relatively new industry in high-availability networks is
emerging. It focuses on eliminating single points of failure to
provide networks that are reliable, available, and scalable.

High-availability or RAS networks run the gamut from those that
must be available 99.99 per cent of the time to those that can
tolerate minor downtime while redundant components initialise,
providing 98 per cent availability. The spectrum runs from fault-

tolerant, where any network fault can be tolerated without taking
down the resource, to fault-resilient, where downtime is measured
in seconds to minutes. The fault may momentarily interrupt network
resources, but the resiliency of the network allows the resource to
become available with minimal downtime.

Integrators can configure hubs, switches, bridges, and routers with
passive backplanes, redundant power supplies, and management
modules so they do not become single points of failure. The network
topology can be configured to route traffic to mission-critical
resources via alternate paths. Some newer topologies, such as FDDI,
implement redundant rings on the same network.

I categorise server failures into five primary areas:

Application/NLM failures causing the server to ABEND;

Network operating system ABENDs;

Failure of disk drives, controllers, and NICs;

Power supply failures; and

System electronic component failures (such as memory and
motherboards).

In time, technology has made great strides in relation to the
integrity and availability of server data storage. RAID technology
allows data to be stored redundantly across several physical disk.
With redundant power supplies, controllers and channels in the disk
subsystems, and hot-swappable drives (drives that can be replaced
without taking the disk subsystem off-line), data storage is no
longer a point of failure in the network.

Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), backup generators, isolated
circuits and alternate electrical power points-of-presence in newer
buildings tend to eliminate raw electrical power as another single
point of failure in a network.

SERVER SAVERS

Most server hardware manufacturers offer redundant power supplies.
Error correcting memory prevents memory error failures. Many
network operating systems offer the ability to configure multiple
NICs on the same segment, preventing a NIC from becoming a single
point of failure. Multiple disk controller cards can be configured
to RAID systems to eliminate these circuit boards as a single point
of failure. The server's motherboard and processor remain the
largest single point of failure on the network.

Servers are prone to several kinds of failures. Hardware failures
are the first that come to mind, and they are the easiest to
address. Component redundancy is the first line of defense. Server
redundancy is the second. Many solutions exist for server
redundancy, from hot-spare servers to servers mirrored via high-
speed links.

Other types of server failures are harder to address. Today, the
most common server failures come from the server NOS or application
ABENDs. Fault-tolerant solutions that mirror each server
transaction are prone to mirroring the errors that led to the
ABEND, leaving a hole in the fault-tolerant armor. In some
situations, fault-resilient solutions that provide hot spares or
live, hot servers (servers already booted and waiting to replace
the failed server) actually provide better fault-tolerance.

Early attempts to make servers fault-resilient involved configuring
them with external redundant disk subsystems. Integrators could
configure the system so that hot spares (or redundant servers
provisioned with sufficient memory), NICs, and disk controllers
could be swapped with failed servers. The network administrator
simply needed to switch the disk subsystem and network cables to
the hot spare and reboot the server. However, this process had a
significant drawback: time. Identifying and swapping out a failed
server could take several minutes. Today, with many gigabytes or
even terabytes of storage in a disk subsystem, rebooting a hot-
spare server might take up to 30 minutes.

If you can tolerate that much downtime, this fault-resilient
solution is the most economical. And its significant advantage over
other fault-resilient implementations is that a single, redundant
server can be a hot spare to many active servers.

MIRROR, MIRROR

More advanced solutions provide server mirroring or clustering
between servers and multiported disk subsystems via high-speed
links. A mirrored server can take over the operation of a primary
server if it becomes unavailable. Mirrored solutions come in both
fault-tolerant and fault-resilient implementations. If the mirrored
server takes over and users are unaware of the change, the system
is fault-tolerant. In a fault-resilient solution, either the server
has to reboot or users need to reinitialise their login,
application, or transaction.

Another advantage of the mirrored/clustered server approach is
protection against natural disasters. By placing mirrored servers
in separate geographical locations, you can mitigate the effects of
such events.

Many network software applications handle fault-resilience
autonomously. For example, database servers (Oracle, Sybase,
Microsoft SQL, and so on) often have a transaction rollback option.
Before a user updates, modifies, or deletes a record, a "snapshot"
of that record is written to a transient area of the disk. If the
update is successful, the snapshot is disregard.

If a failure occurs during the update process, the database rolls
back to the snapshot information. The snapshot is written back to
the appropriate records when the database again becomes available.
This process ensures database integrity for almost any fault-
tolerant/fault-resilient solution. Novell's NOS implements
transaction tracking-its version of transaction rollback-as a
general file attribute.

Novell was one of the first proponents of fault-tolerance and
fault-resilience; in the early 1980s, it outlined a strategic
direction called System Fault Tolerance, or SFT. The company
quickly delivered SFT levels I and II; SFT III was delivered seven
years later.

SFT I, named Hot Fix, involves redirection of bad disk blocks. SFT
II, known as Disk Mirroring or Disk Duplexing, provides hardware
redundancy for the disks. SFT II was the forerunner of RAID Level
I. SFT III implements server mirroring. Two servers connected via
high-speed media provide redundancy for most NOS functions. If one
server suffers a hardware failure, the mirrored server takes over
operation without interruption or data loss.

SFT III is a reengineering of NetWare, dividing its functionality
into two distinct parts. The NOS's hardware-specific functions,
such as disk drivers, NIC drivers, or print servers, are included
in the Input/Output (I/O) engine on the server. The I/O engine is
unique to each server in a mirrored pair. The remaining logical
functions of the NOS are included in the Mirror/Server (M/S)
engine, which is common to both servers. The I/O engines are linked
to the M/S engines by a series of four queues. The servers are
physically linked by a high-speed medium called the Mirrored Server
Link (MSL).

While this solution provides true fault-tolerance, it is limited to
mostly hardware-oriented failures. According to Vinca, recent
studies show that 70 percent of server failures are due to software
disjunction. Runway NLMs or NOS errors will likely be duplicated in
both the primary and mirrored servers. Furthermore, I/O engine
functions such as server-based print services, routing (such as
TCP/IP), and Macintosh support will not be mirrored. If these
components fail, manual intervention is needed to reconfigure and
redeploy the system. Configuring alternative resources to the
server for network print serving or TCP/IP routing may make SFT III
a tighter, fault-tolerant solution. NetWare 4.1 SFT III addresses
the TCP/IP and Apple protocol problems.

SFT III is an elegant solution. It provides true hardware fault-
tolerance in the NetWare environment. It is a well-established,
secure environment for tested and stable server applications.
However, one drawback of SFT III is cost. An SFT III solution
cannot be clustered in a one-to-many mirrored server configuration,
but only as a one-to-one, primary-to-mirrored server solution (see
Figure 1).

BEYOND SFT III

While Novell led the pack in the small to medium uniprocessor
server environment, NCR developed a fault-resilient solution called
LifeKeeper. LifeKeeper is designed for the Unix operating system
and all NOSs that run on Unix, including Microsoft LAN MAN LMX and
NetWare for Unix.

LifeKeeper, an add-on to NCR's Unix, lets up to eight clustered
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) servers share an external disk
subsystem. Each server can maintain its own space on the sub-system
or share space with the other processors. The servers maintain
redundant links and monitor the heartbeat of the other servers via
the SCSI bus, EIA serial connections, and the network media (see
Figure 2).

The servers may be configured in an active-active or active-passive
configuration. In the active-active scenario, each server acts as
an autonomous server. If one of the active servers fails,
LifeKeeper switches applications and communications interfaces to
another active server in the cluster. This server performs the
functions of the failed server as well as its own. In the active-
passive scenario, the passive server does no processing of its own;
it waits to take over for a failed server. The system may be
configured in an n+1 design, with one passive server for up to
seven active ones. The servers need not be the same size as long as
they reside on the same segments and have sufficient memory.

Because LifeKeeper servers are constantly running and monitoring
the heartbeats of other servers, they do not have to reboot as the
affected server.

The LifeKeeper server takes over the failed server's disk and
handles TCP/IP readdressing, so users remain connected and logged
in to the "new" server. However, because the secondary server does
not maintain the failed server's cache, users must resubmit current
transactions or reattach to current server-based applications.

Because a minor time delay occurs between the primary server going
down and the secondary one taking over, and because users have to
reinitialise their applications (not their server connections),
LifeKeeper is a fault-resilient, not a fault-tolerant, solution.

Vinca offers a fault-tolerant hardware/software suite that runs on
many manufacturers' servers. StandbyServer 32 is a server-mirroring
solution that connects a warm, on-line secondary server directly to
the main file server. Data is automatically mirrored to the standby
machine via a high-speed, dedicated link that does not add traffic
to the network. When the main server fails, StandbyServer 32
automatically switches operations to the secondary machine. Users
are back on-line in a matter of minutes. StandbyServer 32 runs on
NetWare, Windows NT, and OS/2 Warp.

Microsoft depends on server vendors and third parties to provide
fault-tolerant/fault-resilient solutions for Windows NT servers.
NCR recently launched two add-ons for fault-resilient NT servers.
The company migrated many of its Unix RAS features to NT and is in
the process of porting LifeKeeper to it. You can buy LifeKeeper for
NT as an add-on to the operating system. A version of LifeKeeper
Lite is included free with NCR's OEM version of Windows NT.
LifeKeeper Lite provides one-to-one server mirroring, but it does
not accomplish TCP/IP readdressing. As such, users are required to
log in to the "new" server. Vinca's StandbyServer is also a server-
mirroring solution for Windows NT.

USING A STAND-IN

Stand-in technology enables one server to stand in for a failed
server. When a server fails, the stand-in server immediately
appears to be another, specific server on the network. Users can
continue working in their current applications; however, access to
other files is slow. A stand-in server must reboot to gain access
to files that were not in use during the crash. A secondary NetWare
server can appear to be a primary one if you reboot it under the
primary server's name. The caveat, though, is that this rebooting
process can take up to 30 minutes.

Network Integrity's LANtegrity product is a hybrid of stand-in and
fault-

tolerant technologies. With the product, one server can instantly
appear to be one of several protected servers. The stand-in server
technology is layered on top of data vault technologies, which
create and maintain a secure, managed storage hierarchy of all
current and historical data.

In addition to presenting itself as the downed server, a stand-in
server must make users' data instantly available. LANtegrity does
not use data-mirroring or multiported data storage technologies;
instead, it uses another software piece called Intelligent Data
Vault.

To enable recovery from any kind of failure-even those that corrupt
data-the data vault is "archival," which means the data vault
contains the current version of data plus earlier versions, all of
which are accessible during stand-in.

LANtegrity's stand-in server presents an identical security and
file system image to the downed server's users while continuing to
be the LANtegrity server to the other protected ones. The
LANtegrity server is never rebooted and can support multiple downed
servers. It maintains an image of the server's memory.

The stand-in image of the downed server is created by manipulating
the incoming file access communications packets. Users can continue
working on their files, but the server may have to reconnect to get
access to other files.

Network Integrity's solution does not involve a significant amount
of disk storage. The Intelligent Data Vault organises itself into a
self-managed storage hierarchy. The most recently active data
resides in its disk, which acts as a cache at the top of the
storage hierarchy. All current protected data is available via a
high-capacity tape autoloader. Earlier versions of files and
deleted files are migrated to a managed, off-line shelf storage on
tape.

Stand-in technology takes the top two components of this storage
hierarchy and makes them appear and operate identically to the
downed server's file system. This process is significantly slower
when accessing files not in cache at the time of the server
failure. Earlier versions of files can be "restored" from the
LANtegrity server into its own stand-in image of the failed server.
Even if the failed server's software corrupted a file while downing
the server, an earlier version of the file is available for use.

The data vault layer poses significant technical challenges when
collecting and managing the data. To maintain a reasonably current
image of all the protected data at a manageable rate, traditional
backup methods are unacceptable; they depend on "full" backups,
which create significant network traffic. LANtegrity's data vault
never copies the same file over the network twice. Only changed
files are copied. As a result, replication opens the door to
continuous protection.

LANtegrity is an example of a fault-resilient solution that
provides full, immediate (within 15 seconds) server access (clients
must reattach and log in) but not full server functionality. The
transactions, applications, and files in use just prior to the
server failure are immediately available.

HARDWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE

Fault-tolerance/fault-resilience is not limited to just the network
operating system or its add-ons. Many hardware vendors include
fault-tolerant features as part of their hardware designs.

For example, NetFrame Systems introduced two fault-tolerant
technologies in its serves: MultiProcessing Parallel Server
Architecture (MPSA) and Gemini. MPSA is built into every
ClusterServer. A system of redundant components, combined with
every high data throughput, minimises downtime-scheduled and
unscheduled.

In Gemini mode, two Intel 100 MHz Pentium processor/ cache modules
operate in tandem. The secondary module backs up the primary one,
instantly taking over all operations in the event of a processor,
cache, or bus interface fault.

NetFrame's technologies also include Channelstart, which allows the
system to recover from transient I/O errors or failures; the
operation is transparent to users. All I/O transactions are safely
recorded while Channelstart clears the error condition, resets the
appropriate hardware, initialises the drivers, and resumes normal
operations.

Tricord Systems, a server manufacturer, markets a line of fault-
tolerant servers called Power-Frame. PowerFrame's design includes a
passive backplane to eliminate the motherboard as a single point of
failure. All active electronic components are isolated to
independent, intelligent subsystems that are hot-pluggable into the
passive backplane.

All subsystems can be redundantly configured or protected with hot
spares, so no major subsystem failure impacts the server operation.

Tricord was one of the first manufacturers to embrace Novell's SFT
III. The entire line of PowerFrame servers support full
implementations of SFT III on mirrored configurations.

CONCLUSION

Fault-tolerance/fault-resilience lets mission-critical systems
operate with minimal downtime, but it does not come cheap.
Redundant components eliminate many of the single points of
failure, but they almost double the hardware costs. Simple
arithmetic can determine whether the "statistically" projected
downtime costs justify the cost of a fault-tolerant or fault-
resilient solution.

Some many-to-one cluster "hot server" designs help lower the costs
per server. In the end, however, the critical nature of the
applications and the availability of data to the users will
determine whether you choose a fault-tolerant or a fault-resilient
solution.  LAN

NETWORKS: Beyond Static Web Pages

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Enhancing static web pages with dynamic media such as audio, video,
animation and interactivity.

When the World Wide Web (WWW) revolutionised the Internet with a
graphically-rich environment in the early nineties, the world
forgot that interactive multimedia delivered on CD-ROM discs was
far more dynamic and captivating. After all, the first web pages
was at best, static, with a few static and low-resolution graphic
images littered across text-centric content.

On the other hand, CD-ROMs were already filled with 16-bit audio,
multi-windowed QuickTime and MPEG video, as well as smooth 3D
animations and walkthroughs. Also, CD-ROMs often delivered
interactivity through the use of graphical buttons that provided
not only visual but audio feedback to the users. On the web, all
you could see then were hypertext links.

When Marc Andressen stepped out of the Mosaic world and started the
Netscape Navigator (or Mozilla) revolution, he created an
extensible web browser model that allowed third-party developers to
add plug-ins to it. Plug-ins for Netscape Navigator are similar in
concept to Adobe Photoshop plug-ins and Macromedia Director Xtras,
allowing enhanced features to programs without requiring complete
software recompilations and upgrades. The plug-in concept also
frees the main software vendors into focusing on delivering core
features without sacrificing execution speed. For example,
Microsoft is mostly guilty of designing programs that grow in
features but become cumbersome in size and speed.

It was not until Netscape Navigator 2.x that plug-ins became
viable. With the aggressive stance Netscape took in capturing the
web market, Microsoft retaliated with its own architecture, but
could not overturn the colossal tide that Netscape created in
capturing about 80 per cent of the web browser market. Today,
Microsoft concedes that its own Internet Explorer will always be
free for downloads and that version 3.0 will embrace Netscape's
enhanced features such as frame, Javascript and of course, plug-
ins.

What are some of the plug-ins available for Netscape Navigator
today?

The main plug-ins that are widely adopted include Macromedia's
Shockwave for Director 4 plug-in (several million downloads) and
Progressive Networks Real Audio (RA) plug-in. Other up-and-coming
plug-ins that we will discuss briefly include TotallyHip's Sizzler
plug-in, Geo's Emblaze, Acrobat PDF, and Macromedia's other
Shockwave versions.

Shockwave for Director 4.x is perhaps the most interesting for web
users, since it encases audio, animation, pseudo-video, and full
interactivity within a secure environment. We are already familiar
with frustrated users across the web who discovered the many flaws
of Java and Javascript, especially in the area of network security.
And since Java is an open architecture, malicious hackers have
already written many Java applets to attack networks.

Shockwave for Director 4.x is different. It uses a BASIC-like
scripting language known as LINGO, which has been "adjusted" for
the web to disallow most file input and output operations, thereby
reducing security risk to a minimum, far safer than Java and
Javascript. And because it encases all media components into a
compiled "applet", users will not be able to make changes to it,
nor will they be able to copy media components easily, unlike Java-
created animations, which are nothing more than a "flipbook" effect
created by calling a series of still images.

We should discuss Macromedia Director briefly so that you
understand its relationship with Shockwave. Director is a
multimedia development environment which uses the film production
paradigm, with a built-in scripting language LINGO.

When you have completed your multimedia production, you save the
file to the hard disk as an uncompiled document (.DIR format).
Under Director 4.x, you use the freely-distributed Afterburner
application to compress the document up to 60 per cent using the
LZW (Lempel Ziv) lossless compression algorithm, and save the
document as a Shockwave document (.DCR). Now the .DCR document can
be served on the web effectively through the Shockwave for Director
4 plug-in.

The next step for a webmaster is to ensure that his server allows
such MIME extensions. You simply include a single line in the
"mime.types" file in the "conf" sub-directory in your "httpd"
directory (see figure 1).

Notice that I have included several MIME types that we will talk
about here, including Real Audio (RA) and QuickTime Video (QT or
MOV).

After you have empowered your server to accept and deliver such
MIME types, you would allow your web pages to embed such data and
to allow non-compatible browsers to know what's going on.

First, note that it is a self-running Macromedia Shockwave for
Director 4.x web page featuring audio and animation (see figure 2).

In your HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document, you simply add a
line that EMBEDS the .DCR document and another line that allows
non-compatible browsers or Netscape browsers without the Shockwave
plug-in to see a static image using the NOEMBED command (see figure
3).

Here's another 2 web pages featuring interactivity with the user
(see figures 4 and 5 on this page).

You will notice that the HTML codes to drive these interactive .DCR
files are identical to the self-running version above (see figure
6).

Some of the constraints of the web means that when you author your
Shockwave documents, you must watch out for a few things. First,
bandwidth issues mean that you must try to optimise your graphics
down to as low a bit depth as possible. And try to reduce the frame
rates of your self-running animation to perhaps, 5 fps. Also,
Netscape does not reproduce all 256 colors in its internal color
palette, so you may have to optimise your 8-bit colour graphic
components down to 6- or 7-bits in colour depth.

Also, Shockwave does not recognise tempo settings in Director 4.x.
So if you need delays in your applet, you need to write LINGO
scripts with embedded DELAY settings. This can set back development
time somewhat since it can be quite tedious.

Another constraint for Shockwave is that unlike Director documents,
it does not support linked media. Therefore, you cannot link
QuickTime or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files to the main
document. And because QuickTime cannot be embedded like static
graphics in Director, you cannot really have synchronised video.

The workaround is to export QuickTime videos into 2 files, a PICS
file (a compiled series of static PICT images) and an audio file.
Within Director, import the PICS file and it will be laid out in
the SCORE window using the "CAST TO TIME" command. Then import the
sound file in Channel 1 and adjust the DELAY settings manually (see
figure 7).

Another popular plug-in is Real Audio from Progressive Networks.
Real Audio is a streaming technology which plays as it downloads.
This is beneficial for users connecting to your web site from 14.4
or even 28.8 Kbps modems, since line reliability may be
inconsistent and the speed is slow. Shockwave for Director
currently does not support streaming, and users must download the
entire applet before he knows its usefulness at all.

Real Audio uses a proprietary compression algorithm to compress
audio much more than traditional AIFF or AIFF-C or AU (Sun's native
as well as Internet's common Audio format). A typical AIFF file may
be more than 200 K while a RA file may be one-tenth of the size.
The chart attached (figure 8, page 42) shows the mechanics of how a
Real Audio server works.

From experience, the disadvantage of Real Audio, compared to
Shockwave, is that you need a dedicated server to serve Real Audio
content. If you do not own Real Audio Personal Server or Server 2.x
software, you cannot deliver content from your server. The
workaround is to allow downloadable Real Audio content, and expect
your users to fetch Real Audio players from the Real Audio site.

I have a web page on Jive Joint web site that features downloadable
Real Audio content, the easiest to deliver, although it requires
Real Audio applications on the client's end (see figure 9 below).

The embedded HTML commands look like that shown in figure 10 below.

Other notable up-and-coming plug-ins include Sizzler, Emblaze,
Acrobat PDF, QuickTime and Shockwave for other Macromedia
applications such as Freehand, Director 5 and Authorware.

Sizzler from TotallyHip is a streaming animation plug-in
technology. You can have animations that download and play
progressively (expect some jerkiness and rough, interlaced images
though). The Sizzler image conversion tool on the Macintosh can
convert QuickTime and PICS images into a streaming animation sprite
(.SPR). However, SPR files are much larger than Shockwave, up to
several times, and therefore take up much more space on a server.
The disadvantage of Sizzler is that it does not support embedded
sounds, and you must write a Java script to play sounds separately.
That defeats the purpose of multimedia on the web.

Emblaze from Geo is also a streaming animation tool which uses
Allegiant SuperCard technology to create vector-based animations.
Because it is vector-based, graphics and animations are smaller,
play better, especially on 14.4 Kbps modems. But the Emblaze
Creator (still in beta, and only available on the Macintosh) is
slow and clunky because it was created with a high-level tool,
SuperCard. And because Allegiant still has not delivered a cross-
platform of the SuperCard authoring environment, you are
constrained to author on the Macintosh environment only. The good
news is that Emblaze can play back from Windows (any version) and
Macintosh, and the plug-in itself is a far smaller download than
Shockwave for Director.

Who doesn't talk about digital movies lately? The most common form
of movies are QuickTime and MPEG. Because QuickTime is a far more
extensible technology and can have virtual reality (QuickTime VR)
as well, we will briefly mention it here.

There are several versions of Netscape QuickTime plug-ins available
today, including Apple's own QuickTime plug-in, KM's Multimedia
Plug, and MovieStar.

MovieStar is the most stable, and can work well with Netscape
Navigator 2.x, which most users have. Apple's own QuickTime plug-in
must work with Netscape Navigator 3.x or Gold versions, and since
these versions have yet to become popular, its use is restricted
for now. KM's Multimedia plug-in is only available for the
Macintosh and therefore cannot become mainstream for now.

Adobe has been competing fiercely with Macromedia on the multimedia
and image processing front lately. Adobe took a different approach
to delivering multimedia on the web, relying on its much-acclaimed
Acrobat Portable Document File (PDF) technology. Acrobat documents
today can have embedded movies and sounds, and allow simple
interactivity.

The downside is that Adobe's Acrobat 3.x technology, which allows
the Acrobat PDF Viewer plug-in, is still in beta, and its own Web
Presenter technology based on Adobe Persuasion is also in beta.
Most users are still apprehensive in adopting beta technology. With
the limited functionality of Web Presenter (a slideshow and
outlining tool), users are more comfortable with authoring on
Shockwave for Director now.

Macromedia has also launched Shockwave for Freehand, Authorware and
betas of Director 5. Freehand is an illustration tool, and
Shockwave plug-in for Freehand allows resolution-indenpendent
vector graphics to be viewed on the web. But its functionality is
probably restricted to graphic studios and advertising agencies for
now. Authorware is a computer-based training tool and the Shockwave
for Authorware plug-in, although capable of compressing Authorware
files, still cannot optimise it well for the web. Currently,
Macromedia positions Shockwave for Authorware for intranet
applications only. Shockwave for Director 5 will be a great
product, but is currently available for Power Macintosh and Windows
95 in betas only.

In the November issue, we will discuss in greater detail how to
optimise multimedia content for Netscape Navigator.  LAN

NETWORKS: HOTTER THAN JAVA: LUCENT'S INFERNO PROMISES TO TURN UP THE HEAT

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

This column's focus has always been on the Internet. This makes
sense, of course, because the Internet is networking's hothouse of
innovation. But other major public networks are out there: there's
cable television, the telephone infrastructure, and, for that
matter, there's cellular. At the edges of all these non-Internet
networks-at the point where you and I make our telephone calls and
watch our movies-the terminals are getting smarter.

What do I mean by "smarter"? I'm talking about better CPUs and more
memory. Still, even the upcoming generation of small gadgets won't
have enough horsepower to directly adopt Internet inno vations as
we know them. Java and the latest browsers, though they bring huge
possibilities to a broad range of traditional desktop computers,
require the equivalent of at least a fast 486 chip and a good 4MB
of available memory (that is, 4MB above and beyond the operating
system's own requirements) for high-quality functionality.

THINK SMALL

If you're building a telephone or a set-top box, you can't load it
up with a lot of silicon. You may want to put in a single SIMM's
worth of memory (which is about 1MB these days) and something along
the lines of a 386 CPU. You want to sell your devices in the
several-tens-of-dollars price range, not the several-hundred-
dollars range. And your target volume should far exceed the number
of Compaq Presarios in the world. After all, there are a lot more
small, consumer-oriented gizmos-such as Sharp, Casio, and Apple
PDAs; Sega game computers; smart telephones; and singing microwave
ovens-than there are desktop computers.

The one and only network software player-at least for now-in this
broad market of small, potentially networked gadgets is Lucent
Technologies (Basking Ridge, NJ). When AT&T recently split three
ways, it was Lucent that acquir-ed the bulk of Bell Laboratories
and, therefore, its expert knowledge. Bell Laboratories invented
Unix and C, so it's safe to say that the folks at Lucent know a
little about computers and networking.

Recently, the Bell folks announced a product they have been working
on for a couple of years-a software suite called Inferno. Inferno
can serve as one of two functions: on small machines, Inferno is an
operating system, and on desktop machines, it's a suite of
applications. This means that Inferno coexists with whatever
operating system a particular desktop machine uses.

On the desktop, Inferno occupies much of the same market space that
Sun Microsystems' Java does, although during the product's May 1996
announcement everyone on the Lucent team tried to downplay this
fact. Inferno's programming language (called Limbo) lets you build
the equivalent of Java applets.

The differences that exist between Java and Inferno might also give
Sun pause. First of all, Lucent claims that Inferno runs
comfortably within 1MB of memory. In addition, Inferno implements
network operating constructs that a language such as Java is not in
a position to implement. With Inferno, you get features such as
authentication and native file management (including exporting your
file system to other clients at will) right from the operating
system.

SON OF PLAN 9

Finally, Inferno draws on the research done at Bell Labs during the
development of the Plan 9 operating system (see "Plan 9: Son of
Unix," Interoperability, Summer 1996 issue, page 41) to create an
operating system that distributes all over the network the various
kinds of work that an application performs. For example, Inferno's
browser splits its onscreen presentation away from all the data
management issues such as looking up domain names and figuring out
where to draw images within a page of text. This way, slower
terminals can focus on what you see and can off-load the CPU-
intensive work to CPU servers located back at the service
provider's shop.

Distributing the various tasks that have to be performed in order
for a client to make a presentation is an enormously powerful
concept and one with which Bell Labs has grappled for several
years. "We looked at what we had done with [the] Plan 9 [operating
system]," says Rob Pike, key Inferno developer, "and realized that
if we stripped it down to just the distribution capabilities, we
would have something very small and very powerful."

A lot remains to be seen, but there's no question that Lucent is a
vendor that has the attention of the regional Bells and cable
service providers. The possibilities that surround Inferno's
potential to quickly penetrate a broad market are staggering.
Inferno may be compelling at the corporate level, too: If you're
writing thin-client Web applications for your corporate intranet,
why not write to the same operating system that your telephones are
using and get extra capabilities for free?  LAN

NETWORKS: CABLE TESTERS IN THE FIELD

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Field testing a cable plant serves to verify its transmission
performance. This results in a more professional hand-off from your
cabling contractor. The guidelines presented in this series is a
high level summary of the results of our evaluation and experience
using the cable test instruments. These guidelines are not meant to
duplicate the information in TIA/EIA TSB67, or the contents of
individual field tester manuals, but to provide additional
information to address issues relevant to the testing of structured
cabling installations.

These guidelines should be considered generic to all testers and as
a general rule it is important to upgrade to the latest firmware
and maintain the current documentation (including readme files) of
the testers to ensure up-to-date operational procedures.

Calibration of Field Testers and Test Configurations

Different field test instruments have slightly different
calibration procedures. It is important that these procedures are
followed. Proper calibration of the field testers is required to
ensure accurate measurements.

Calibration of Remote Injector

A short length of tester equipment cord (supplied with the field
tester) is used to connect the main unit to the remote unit and the
calibration sequence activated from the main unit. This will result
in the main unit determining attenuation loss inherent in the
testers and calibrate this loss to be 0 dB (see Figure 1).
Different manufacturers provide different calibration kits. If
adapters are needed for the measurement of the installed cabling,
it is a good idea to include these adapters in the calibration.
This is because adapters are not part of the installed cable plant
and should consequently be calibrated out of the attenuation
measurement, resulting in better measurement accuracy for
attenuation.

Selection of Cable Type

Selecting the cable type closest to the cable being tested will
yield better accuracy, especially for length and propagation delay
measurements. Often, the field tester is pre-loaded with various
cable types, including 1061/2061 cables. The main result of
selecting a cable type is the selection of the nominal velocity of
propagation (NVP). Values for NVP are obtained by tester vendors
from cable data sheets, or sometimes verbally from individuals
representing cable vendors. Consequently, these NVP values are
often incorrect or out of date. It is critical that the correct
cable type be selected and the NVP determined using the field
tester calibration procedure.

Selection of Test Configuration

TSB67 defines two test configurations, a basic link and a channel
(see Figures 2 and 3). A channel assumes two connections at each
end while a basic link assumes one connection at each end.

For example, if you are testing the cabling installed by a
contractor from the wall outlet to the termination in the
telecommunications closet, you need to configure the field tester
for a basic link. If on the other hand, you are diagnosing an end-
to end cabling circuit that will be attached to equipment at both
ends, including cross-connections, patch cords, and equipment
cords, you need to configure the field tester to measure a channel.
Sometimes, you may have a situation where there are two connections
at one end and a single connection at the other end. For routine
autotest measurements, it is acceptable to measure this
configuration as a channel in the interest of efficiency. However,
for diagnostic or single parameter tests, this configuration will
need to be tested as a channel and a basic link. The end that has
two connections must pass channel NEXT requirements, while the end
with one connection must pass basic link NEXT requirements. This
type of dual configuration testing may be necessary only if you are
working in a detailed analysis or diagnostic mode.

Calibration of NVP

TSB67 outlines a simple calibration procedure for NVP using a known
length of cable. Since various testers use different internal
procedures to find the pair with the shortest electrical delay
(corresponds to maximum velocity of propagation), calibration is
the only sure way of initialising the field tester with the right
NVP for the particular cable type you are testing. This will result
in more accurate length measurements and less variability of length
between different pairs within a 4-pair cable. Figure 4 illustrates
the NVP calibration setup.

To calibrate, reel off 25 metres (82 feet) of cable and attach
modular jacks to both ends. Note the exact jacket foot marks and
determine and length of cable that is cut from the reel. Attach
this connectorised cable to the main unit and the remote unit using
tester. Select NVP calibration from the menus and enter the length
of the cable. Note that since the length is determined from the
foot marks on the jacket, it is necessary to make sure that the
field tester is set to the appropriate units (metric or US
Customary units) before running the calibration command from the
main unit. The main unit will display the NVP determined for the
1061/2061 cable that you are calibrating.

Save this NP as a default for the appropriate cable type, so that
you do not have to re-calibrate NVP again for the same type of
cable. If you move on to another installation, you may have a
different cable, which requires that you calibrate NVP again.

Field Measurement Procedures

It is important to develop uniform test practices and provide
adequate training. Although each installation may have different
requirements, it is risky letting each job get tested differently.
These units are much more complicated than continuity buzzers, and
improper settings or inadequate battery management could waste
hours worth of testing. Suitable calibration procedures and
intervals must be enforced. For example, calibration of the remote
unit every day of use is a good practice. Calibration of NVP for
each job will ensure that the NVP represents the value of the cable
being installed at a site.

Sanity Checks

Any tester should undergo regular checkups, or some form of sanity
check. Users should develop some expertise to assess whether a
tester is providing useful results. One simple method is to
construct a sample link to be used as a reference. Make sure that
is physically protected and not subject to movement. Expect some
variation with temperature, humidity, and time, but this is a valid
check for malfunctioning units. A link such as this is required for
Nominal Velocity of Propagation (NVP) calibration may be used as a
reference link and will serve as a simple test to verify the
consistency of a field tester. If this same link is used to check
periodically for tester repeatability, one will get a useful
indication that the field tester is functioning properly (see
Figure 4).

IS 11801 and TIA TSB67 Testing Issues

With the release of TIA-568-A, TIA TSB67 and IS 11801, customers
are faced with confusing choices in specifying testing requirements
and interpreting test results. Most of the confusion arises from
attempting to test against the performance limits of IS 11801. It
should be noted that several of the performance limits listed in IS
11801 are marked "ffs" ("for future study").

Some of the reasons behind the "ffs" entries include lack of
agreement from cable vendors, inconsistent results from field
testing trials, and lack of accuracy determination methods for
hand-held testing equipment in relation to such parameters. In
addition, while specifying performance limits in IS 11801, the
international standards community is still to release detailed test
procedures and test configurations.

The horizontal link from which the IS 11801 performance includes
two connections in the floor Distributor (Horizontal Cross-connect
in TIA-568-A), a 5 metre patch cord, 90 metres of cable and a
connection at the work area. This link specifically excludes the
equipment cable and work area cable. It is not clear whether hand-
held instruments, compliant to TIA TSB-67 are capable of accurately
testing this link, as this would require the test set to "exclude"
the equipment and work area cables.

One of the parameters marked "ffs" in IS 11801 is Return Loss (RL).
While the method for accurately measuring RL in the field is yet to
be specified, additional difficulties can be encountered when using
test leads or patch cords incorrectly matched to the cabling
system, or degraded by repeated use. At least one of the TSB67
compliant test sets in the market includes two choices for IS 11801
configurations (with and without RL), and the test set manufacturer
advises the users to use the "IS 11801 without RL" option. The
difficulties experienced by some users when testing RL with
incorrectly matched test leads highlights the advantages of a
cabling system designed with matched components.

In contrast with IS 11801, the TIA 568-A Standard and TSB-67
include practical test configurations (Figures 2 & 3) and accuracy
specifications for hand-held instruments. While work is underway to
harmonise the differences, and to reach practical agreement on the
IS 11801 specifications marked "ffs", the practical choice is to
refer to TIA TSB-67 for accurate field testing.

Use of Interface Adapters

Sometimes, an interface adapter is necessary to attach field
testers to the channel/link under test. These adapters are an extra
element in the link configuration and may affect the accuracy of a
measurement. In general, unknown adapters should be avoided. To
measure a basic link with a 110 interface, an adapter cord with 110
on one end and the interface of the tester on the other end is
preferred. Test instrument vendors should provide this adapter
cord. For channel measurements, testers provide an adapter from the
tester interface connector to a modular jack. Again, it is
important that only cords and adapters provided by the testers be
used to attach field testers to the link under test. Note that TSB-
67 requires that field tester cords do not exceed 2 metres.

Durability of Connecting Hardware Interfaces

An important issue not yet handled by any of the testers is keeping
track of the life cycle of test interfaces. Any jack or plug has a
reliable limit on connect/ disconnect cycles. Interfaces should be
serialised (marked) and users should keep track of how many tests
are performed so their reliable limit is not exceeded. Additional
interfaces should be ordered and available for replacement at
suitable intervals. Field testers currently do not have a mechanism
for storing the number of times an instrument has been used. Hence
it is a good practice to maintain approximate (to the nearest 100)
cycles of usage so that plug/jack contacts can be inspected and
replaced as necessary. Different testers claim different number of
usage cycles for accurate measurements. As a first step these
vendor guidelines may be sufficient. If measurements are not
repeatable or if the failure rate of links increases, it may be
time to replace the plug/jack interfaces.

Backup Procedures

Backup protection is another important issue. A simple strategy
could be to print tests every few hours. This might be suitable for
some small jobs, but may be too time consuming for most. A better
strategy is to uplink to a PC every 4 hours and make duplicates on
floppy disks. Also, make sure an extra set of charged batteries are
ready.

Structural Return Loss and Return Loss Measurements

Structural Return Loss (SRL) characterising "impedance roughness"
of a cable is a cable parameter and is measured in a laboratory
environment in accordance with ASTM D 4566 Method 3, or equivalent.
SRL is not specified as a field measurement for links and chan-nels
either in TIA/EIA-568-A or in IS 11801 standards. Hence any claims
to measuring SRL in the field should be considered non-standard and
questionable.

Return loss is a measure of reflected signal and is used to
characterise either individual components or links. When
characterising links, return loss is an indication of impedance
mismatches of different components within links and is not
specified in either TIA/EIA 568-A, or the associated TIA/EIA TSB-67
field testing document. Further TIA/EIA TSB-67 clearly states that
return loss is under study. The IS 11801 document has a slightly
different approach when dealing with items under study. It shows
the possible target values for future revision of the IS 11801
document and qualifies these values as "FFS" (For Future Study).
The reason these are marked FFS is because no industry agreement
has been reached on the possible values, test methods, and
measurement instruments.

Despite the above background, certain field test manufacturers may
implement proprietary test schemes for measuring return loss to
differentiate their instruments in the market. These proprietary
test schemes have not been reviewed and accepted by industry and
must therefore be viewed with caution.

Differences in Length Measurements

Different pairs within a 4-pair cable use different twist rates to
improve NEXT performance. This introduces a physical difference in
length between different pairs. Additionally, the velocity of
propagation may vary between pairs because of material differences.
Such differences are normal, and within the operating limits of
cabling and applications standards. Furthermore, these differences
are not significantly affected by installation of cabling, and
should therefore not be a major source of concern when checking the
quality of the installation.

Delay skew is the term commonly used to refer to the difference in
propagation delay over different pairs. The worst case delay skew
allowed in application standards is 50 ns for a 100 different
pairs. The worst case delay skew allowed in application standards
is 50 ns for a 100 metre channel. Given that the speed of light in
open space is 1 ft/ns and assuming a relative velocity of 0.6 c for
copper cabling, the maximum difference in electrical length allowed
is 30 feet (50 ns x 0.6) for a 100 metre channel. Differences of up
to 20 feet in the length measurements of pairs for a typical cable
run are not uncommon and fall within the requirements of
application standards.

Calibration of NVP for each different type of cable is critical to
reduce errors in length measurements. Different cables require re-
calibration. Note that the NVP calibration results must be saved to
ensure the new NVP values are effective. To test if the calibration
was saved, power down the tester, power up and check if the new NVP
values for the cable type being installed are current in memory.
(Note: Because of accuracy issues, TIA standards do not endorse
measurement of propagation delay and delay skew using field
testers).

25-Pair Cabling

TIA considers 25-pair cabling to be backbone cabling and requires
NEXT to conform to "power-sum" requirements. These computations
involve hundreds of pair combinations and several thousand data
points for conformance testing. Power sum NEXT testing is not
possible with currently available field testers. The alternative is
to check individual 4 pair units within a 25-pair cable and verify
each unit meets the 4-pair horizontal cabling requirements. For
example, to test a zone cabling installation with a 25-pair cable
serving six work areas, the six individual circuits can be verified
as basic links or channels, depending on the current test
configuration. Note: 25-pair cable is different cable from 4-pair
cable, and its velocity of calibration must be calibrated and
stored in the field tester. Any 4-pair unit from the 25-pair cable
may be used for calibration.  LAN

NETWORKS: THE COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE IS THE KEY TO INTERACTIVE WEB SITES

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

This series of tutorials, which has been running since July, has
examined services commonly available on the Internet and has
explored what you, as a network manager, need to do to make such
services available within your company (via your corporate
intranet) and to others (via the Internet).

Last month, we focused on HTML and took a first look at hypertext
links. This month, we'll continue to explore HTML, and we'll take a
look at the common gateway interface (CGI).

Using simple tags, you can make any word or phrase a hyperlink.
Hyperlinks are not limited to text, however. They can also be
images. The following code fragment shows how to make an image into
a hyperlink: <A

HREF="http://www.amphibian.com/frog.htm"><IMGSRC="frog.gif"></A>

This sample code displays the graphic image frog.gif, and-if the
user clicks on that image-causes the Web browser to request the Web
page frog.htm from the Web server www.amphibian.com.

THE COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE

HTML, along with HTTP, is the enabling technology of the World Wide
Web. HTML's most compelling feature is hypertext linking. When you
look for information in a conventional book you might search the
index for a key word, then flip through the book to find the
referenced page, and hope to find the information you seek. By
contrast, when searching for information on the Web, simply
clicking on a hyperlink and immediately jumping to the referenced
page is gratifyingly quick and easy. HTML is, however, essentially
a read-only format. It's not interactive except when using the
mouse to navigate. HTML pages are static documents that don't
change until someone (the Webmaster, in many cases) accesses the
Web server and edits them.

From the start, Web developers have been looking for ways to make
Web servers interactive to allow users to input information as well
as retrieve information. The standard way of delivering information
in this manner is now known as the common gateway interface. Using
CGI, the Web server, in response to a user request for information,
runs a program to search for that information and returns the
results to the user. In order to achieve these results, the Web
server typically generates an HTML page by inserting a few HTML
statements into a pre-existing page. A Web server using CGI in this
manner could potentially run an infinite variety of programs.

If you've used a Web search engine to find an item of interest,
you've used CGI. But CGI itself isn't the search engine. Rather,
it's a way to interface programs, such as search engines, with Web
servers.

HTTP (Web) servers are designed primarily to serve up HTML
documents. CGI files, however, aren't documents, they're programs.
Therefore, to store CGI programs, most Web servers use a special
directory, commonly named cgi-bin. The Web server knows that files
stored in the cgi-bin directory are to be executed rather than
simply sent to the user's Web browser for display. CGI programs can
be written in a wide variety of languages, including DOS batch
files, BASIC, C, and scripting languages such as Perl. It's the job
of the CGI to activate the CGI program at the proper time and pass
the program to any necessary user- or operating environment-
generated data. The CGI program then processes whatever data is
generated. Once the program accomplishes this process (which should
take only seconds-the goal here is interactivity), it must return
some output to the user via the user's Web browser. To make the
output appropriate for browser display, the CGI program must format
its output in the form of an HTML document.

A FORM FOR EVERYTHING

A CGI program has to somehow get from the user any data to be
processed. That's where HTML forms come into play. HTML forms are
similar to paper forms: They provide specific spaces in which to
enter specific data items. A simple form is shown in Figure 1. This
sample form has one text input field: product name. The form also
has some multiple-choice fields, in which, for example, the user
can check off the type of product, as well as what networking
protocols the product supports. The form also has a button the user
can click on to submit the entry. (A CGI program will only act upon
the information in a form when the form data has been submitted to
the CGI program.) Clicking on the form's Clear Form button resets
the form back to its default values. The HTML code for this form is
shown in Listing 1 (page 33). Note that to aid in discussion,
Listing 1 includes line numbers, which you wouldn't use in actual
HTML code.

The source code for a form is bound by the <form action="url"> and
</form> tags (see line 1 and line 14 of Listing 1). The use of
action specifies the action to be taken when the form is submitted.
In other words, action determines which CGI program should be run
in order to process the form, and you specify either a full or
partial URL for that program. Depending on the Web server, you may
be able to set a default directory for all CGI programs. As long as
the program you want to run is stored in that directory you need
only specify the program's file name. Otherwise, you will probably
have to provide a complete URL for the file.

Use method to move input data from the form into the CGI program
that's going to process that data. We'll explore the methods by
which this is done in more detail next month, but for now, just be
aware that there are two general methods you can use: "get" and
"post". If you're going to use the "get" method to transfer data
from the form to the CGI program specified in the action URL, be
sure that the CGI program is written to accept data in this manner.
By the same token, if you use "post" to send data from your form,
be sure the CGI program is expecting "post" data input.

Line 2 and line 3 of Listing 1 prompt the user to enter data. After
the prompts comes the code that puts a text field into the form
(line 4). Entering input type="text" tells the Web browser that it
is a text field. Specifying name="name" tells the browser that the
name of this field is name. (This example asks for the name of a
product; if you want to

ask for the user's address, you might name this field address.)
size="25"

 indicates that the text box will be large enough to see 25
characters at a time. maxlength="30" means that the field can hold
up to 30 characters of text.

In this case, the length of the field exceeds the length of the
box, so a scroll bar will appear if the user types a long text
string.

Next on the form are radio buttons, followed by check boxes. These
are both multiple-choice, but they differ slightly in how they work
in that, using check boxes, you can check more than one box at a
time, but you can select only one radio button. Clicking on a radio
button clears the radio button that was previously selected. By
comparison, selecting one check box does not deselect another.

Let's discuss radio buttons first. You determine the button style
by setting the type for the input equal to radio. There are three
statements for radio buttons (line 6 through line 8)-one for each
of the possible selections. Each statement contains
name="prodtype." This creates a logical field named prodtype. If
the first button is checked, the field prodtype takes on the value
bridge. (You can determine the value by using the statement
"value='bridge'"). Note also the keyword checked in line 6. When
the form first appears, the radio button for bridge will be
checked; in other words, we've made this setting the default. The
user can override this default setting by clicking on the Router or
Switch button.

Next comes a series of three check boxes that allow the user to
indicate which network protocols the product supports (represented
by lines 9 through 11of the sample code in Listing 1). When a user
clicks in a box, "X" appears in that box to indicate that it is
checked. Clicking again on a checked check box removes the "X," or
unchecks the box.

You create a check box field with the statement input type= "check
box ." You also need to specify the name of the input field. In
Listing 1, the name of the input field for the first check box is
set to IP. The sample code uses the keyword checked, indicating
that this box is selected by default, which the user can clear by
clicking on the check box.

When a check box is selected, by default the field with that name
has its value set to "on." Although it is not included in the
example, you can optionally use the value attribute to set the
value, for example, to "green" when the box is selected. When the
check box is not selected, the field has no value. In this example,
the default setting for all three boxes is checked. Thus, unless
the user clears the boxes, the form returns ip=on, ipx=on, and
appletalk=on. If only the IP box is selected, the form returns only
ip=on. The IPX and AppleTalk boxes will be disregarded.

I don't have quite enough space here to finish the discussion of
our sample form, so we'll have to conclude that next month. Also,
so far, I've discussed gathering data to be passed to a CGI
program, but I haven't said much about how that data is transferred
or how the CGI program sends output back to the user. I'll cover
that (and more) in next month's Tutorial.  LAN

NETWORKS: Getting Basic Netware from Within Windows: A hidden menu
Automatic disk maintenance Securing automatic logins

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

A HIDDEN MENU

The following procedure will help you create a NetWare pop-up menu
that allows your users to perform some basic operations in a
NetWare environment from within Windows 3.1.

To enable the menu on a client, make sure the client's network
driver or secondary network driver for Windows is the NetWare
device driver (netware.drv). To do so, put either of the following
lines into the client's

system.ini file:

network.drv=netware.drv

secondnet.drv=netware.drv

Then, create a file in the root of the client's Windows directory
and name it netware.ini. In this file, type:

[Options]

netwarehotkey=1

The next time a user starts Windows, he can just press the <F6> key
and a small menu will pop up onscreen. The menu allows a user to
log in to and log out of a file server, map drives and printers,
and change the hot key.

Note: You must load the netx shell before you can use this feature.

Jafar H. Alhashemi

Network Administrator

Information Technology Department

Kuwait Airways

New York

Editor's note: The netware.drv driver Alhashemi refers to is found
in the older, 2.0x version of the NetWare device driver. The
NetWare pop-up menu is a built-in feature of that generation of
drivers only.

In the newer, 3.0x version of netware.drv, Novell includes a hot-
key feature that allows users to call up the NetWare User Tools
application from within Windows 3.1.

Users access the NetWare Users Tools window to quickly perform
network operations-such as map drives and printers, send messages,
display server resources, and so on-similar to those features found
with the afore-mentioned pop-up menu available with netware.drv
2.0x.

To enable the hot key for the NetWare Users Tools application, you
need to access the NetWare Settings window. You can do this by
clicking on the Network icon in the Control Panel.

The NetWare Settings window contains an option for enabling the hot
key, and an option to specify a hot key (the default is <F6>).

As with Alhashemi's instructions, you also need to specify the
NetWare device driver as the network driver. Unlike the 2.0x
driver, you don't have to create the netware.ini file, it is
created automatically when you enable the hot key feature using the
NetWare Settings window.

AUTOMATIC DISK MAINTENANCE

As a network administrator for a 160-workstation system, I used to
receive calls on a weekly basis from individuals having trouble
saving files on their computers. I have eliminated the bulk of
those calls by adding the following lines in the system login
script of our NetWare 4.1 servers:

if day_of_week = "wednesday" and os_version =

"v6.22" then begin

#c:\dos\scandisk c: /autofix /nosave /nosummary

end

When a user boots his or her computer and the system date reads
"Wednesday," the login script launches the DOS scandisk program.

Editor's note: Scandisk, which is available in DOS 6.x, analyses
computer drives for errors relating to the file allocation table,
file system structure, directory tree structure, and the physical
surface of the disk.

The /autofix switch automatically corrects any problems scandisk
encounters, thereby avoiding any user input. The /nosave switch
tells the program to delete any lost clusters it finds. The
/nosummary switch tells the program not to display its summary
screen after it finishes the scan.

To really clean things up, I add:

#c:\dos\defrag c: /f /s:n

Editor's note: The Defrag command reorganises information stored on
a disk to make the storage more efficient and to optimise the
performance of the disk. The /f switch tells the program to
defragment the files on the drive indicated-in this case the c:
drive. The /s:n switch organises files alphabetically, by name.

The two DOS commands scandisk and defrag, with their parameters,
run without user intervention. Users know that their computers will
take a little longer to boot on Wednesdays.

Securing Automatic Logins

The July 1996 Patches and Fixes column correctly points out that
configuring a workstation to log in automatically presents a
security risk, especially if the password is contained in a text
file.

I've set up a process based on NetWare's Station Restriction
feature. My unattended stations that perform unique functions do
not have passwords, but they are restricted to one login at a
specific node address.

I've taken steps to prevent exiting to DOS by removing the comspec
environment variable from the autoexec.bat. Also, I force the
machines to log out of the network once they exit the application.

For me, this approach works because 99 per cent of my users use
their PC as a "terminal," and all applications are run off the
network.

To prevent shelling to DOS from within a DOS application, I use the
following lines in a batch file:

set oldcomspec=%comspec%

set comspec=

<load application here>

set comspec=%oldcomspec%

If a user tries to shell to DOS from an app, he receives an error
message, as the comspec variable is invalid. Some DOS applications
won't run correctly without the comspec variable, but I've found
that Lotus 1-2-3, DrawPerfect, Reflex, Symphony, and WordPerfect
work fine.

Under Windows, I prevent users from accessing DOS by not providing
them with a DOS icon and by removing the Run command from the File
menu (I use Saber Menu System).

To force machines to automatically log out after exiting an
application, I add the following lines to the end of the batch file
that runs the application. In fact, I use these lines at the end of
the batch files that run our DOS and Windows menus so that users
know what to do at the f:\login prompt. Here are the lines:

<commands that start

application>

rem Change default drive to login; clear screen

z:cd cal1\sys:login

cls

rem Blank out the DOS prompt

set prompt=

rem Display the LOGOUT message

type v:logout.txt

rem Run OUT.BAT located in SYS:LOGIN

out

The contents of logout.txt state that the logout is complete, and
to please turn the system off or press any key to restart. Here's
out.bat:

@echo off

logout > nul :

pause > nul :

warmboot

warmboot.com is a utility that restarts the machine. I forgot where
I got that particular utility, but there are several utilities
available that perform the same function.

With this setup, users see a confirming message to either reboot or
turn off the system. If the user presses any key, except <Ctrl-C>,
the PC will reboot. If the user gets smart and presses <Ctrl-C>,
the batch file will terminate. But, because there is no DOS prompt,
that user will probably just reboot anyway. (However, informed
users could type set prompt=$p$g and find themselves at z:\login.)

You can secure the remote device mentioned in "Following the
Password Piper" by restricting the login name to the node address
of that remote device. With NetWare 2.x or 3.x, this naming is done
through Syscon. In NetWare 4.x, it is an NDS property.

By using this restriction, a network login which uses the device's
node address as the login name has to be performed at the device to
which the address is tied. A password is not necessary, but could
be used for additional security.

Editor's note: The preceding letters refer to "Following the
Password Piper," which ran in Patches and Fixes in the July 1996
issue (page 28). The submission discusses one network manager's
desire for a fix that enables a workstation to automatically log on
to the network (composed, in this case, of NetWare servers) when
switched on. This process would simplify the resetting of devices,
such as e-mail servers, located at remote branch offices.

In the event that such a machine were to hang due to a software
problem, a nontechnical user could restore that machine online by
simply turning the power off and then back on.

"Following the Password Piper" also discusses ways in which such an
automatic logon could be accomplished. These solutions involve
putting the account and password in a file on the station's local
disk drive.

We point out the security exposure this involves and recommend that
the person who does the power switching also type in the password,
as opposed to keeping the password on disk.

NetWare does allow you to restrict a particular account's login to
a specific node address. While that feature can be handy and will
deter some potential attackers, it isn't going to prevent
sophisticated attacks. On some networks, such as Arcnet, the node
address is set by the installer and, therefore, can be set to any
address. On Ethernet networks, the manufacturer embeds the node
address in firmware. Note that while Ethernet NICs default to using
the address in firmware, many NICs have options that allow an
alternate address to be used, which makes it possible for one node
to impersonate another node.

Our concern about placing the password on a workstation's local
disk drive is that the network becomes vulnerable to any intruder
with physical access to that workstation. Restricting login to a
specific node address is equally vulnerable. An intruder can gain
access to a file server by simply switching on that workstation.

We included these suggestions because we feel they are good ones
for network managers to have in their bag of security tricks. They
can be a good way to augment security, but we caution you against
relying on them as foolproof solutions.

Sheldon mentions another NetWare feature-the ability to restrict
simultaneous logins. By default, users can have multiple,
simultaneous sessions. You can, however, limit an account to a
single login. This approach can be useful, particularly for e-mail
servers or other such machines on the network. If such a node is
logged in, no one else is able to log in with that account name.

This approach, too, is vulnerable to someone who has physical
access to that machine. Also, if the workstation is not logged in
at all times, there will be periods of vulnerability.  LAN

NETWORKS: Who's Afraid of TCP/IP?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Need to understand TCP/IP and how to buy a good stack? TCP/IP is
now enjoying its day in the sun with the explosion of the Internet
and the emergence of the corporate Intranet.

Computer systems in use now are diverse. From a mainframe running
an operating system like VM or MVS, down to a PC that could be
running Windows, DOS, NT or OS2. In between are minicomputers that
could be running anything like Solaris, IBM AIX or HP-UX). You have
proprietary local area, generic operating system, mainframes
running something, minis running something else, and when you want
to network all these, one of the best technologies to use is
TCP/IP. After all, if TCP/IP is what you use on the outside, why
shouldn't you use it on the inside?

Crucial Add-ons

Key to TCP/IP technology are the add-ons such as security,
collaboration, mobility, interoperability, and ease of use.

Security involves encrypting data going between PCs and the company
firewall, for example, developing interoperability with firewalls
so you can create what is called a private network between your PC
and the firewall. Companies are focusing on enabling security into
the technology itself (IPSEC, Cylink, RSA, etc.) and also on
interoperability of security-working on establishing the standards,
and ensuring interoperability as a whole.

Collaboration software using TCP/IP as the underlying transport can
take the form of e-mail, discussion databases, video-conferencing,
etc. Companies are implementing collaboration protocols for the
next generation of audio, video and workgroup collaboration needs
using RSVP (reservation protocol), multicasting, IPv6, RTCP (Real-
Time Protocol Control Transport), or RTP (Real-Time Protocol
Transport).

With 50 per cent of all PCs sold today being laptops, the ability
for users to go mobile and still be connected to the office network
is essential. Many companies are working with technologies like
mobile IP, using one static IP address to communicate at all times
with a corporate Intranet without having to change your IP
addresses when you change you location on the corporate network.

What Features?

If you are looking for a comprehensive TCP/IP package, check if it
offers the following features:

  The ability to detect a router on the network should you not have
access to the systems administrators when you need them.

  The 7a package that supports not only TCP/IP but co-exists well
with related technologies like NetBIOS, IPX, Banyan, DEC, IBM etc.

  Address and name resolution which offers convenient features like
DHCP to manage your addresses in a simplified manner, WinSNMP
support for interoperability with third party network managers like
HP OpenView and MIB11 compliance. And you should look for a package
that supports VXD technology so you can optimise memory management
capabilities of Win95.

  Simultaneous connection from the desktop so that if you run your
software on a LAN and want to switch to a WAN, you can have both
resident in memory at the same time. Uses: serial send situations
(bank and retail), LAN and Cable situations (interactive cable),
redundancy (financial), LAN/serial connections.

  Mobile IP-so users can connect to a corporate Intranet without
changing their IP address;

  Multicast facility, which allows you to send to a group of hosts
rather than to all hosts (broadcast). The ability to multicast is
crucial to videoconferencing when you wish to link with a select
group rather than with everyone on the net.

  Compatibility with ISDN technologies like WinISDN, CAPI; support
for Sun's Yellow Pages NIS (network information service);
compatibility with firewall standards like SOCKS; compatibility
with new Novell technologies like Netware/IP, etc.

  Compliance with other related technologies like TDI (Transport
Driver Interface)-a new standard Microsoft is promoting that
resides between the Kernel protocols and apps services.

Who Provides?

Choose a company that is looking at new technologies such as RSVP
,RTCP, and RTP. RSVP reserves bandwidth for use with video and
audio, collaboration, workgroup applications, e-mail, Intranet
traffic, etc. Transport protocols are for real-time applications
such as point-of-sale.

Look for a company that follows all the issues being discussed on
the IETF (Internet Engineer Task Force) work group such as
security, mobile IP and IPv6. One of the biggest problems facing
the Internet and IPv4 is the lack of address space. IPv6 will offer
expanded addressing from 32-bit to 128-bit with hierarchical
scalability.

This will be essential for enterprise, Internet, intranet, PDAs,
cellular, cable TV, and smart appliances.

Your partner should have a well defined strategy for dealing with
issues like next generation IP addressing-how will they make the
transition from current addressing to the new one?

How will they deal with it? Gradual transition is possible, based
on a dual stack strategy, with hosts and routers upgraded
independently and no single 'doomsday,' which may be more
convenient for a lot of companies.

In my view, considering the developments, TCP/IP has become the
standard and is the foundation to the future of connectivity and
communications.

NETWORKS: Optimising a print server for NetWare

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QHow does a network print server act in a Novell NetWare network?

AS You can choose Print Server Mode or Remote Printer Mode. In
Print Server Mode the print server emulates a workstation or file
server running the PSERVER software. This mode provides high
performance but requires one NetWare license for each print server.
In Remote Printer Mode the print server emulates a workstation
running the RPRINTER or NPRINTER software. Performance is lower
than PSERVER but extra licenses are not needed.

QHow does a print server act in a Unix environment?

AA network print server can either act as an independent node or it
can be integrated in the network spool system. In both cases it has
its own IP address, which is set as usual with the ARP or BOOTP
commands. Print jobs can either be transferred directly to the
print server by using FTP or telnet, or sent to a print queue with
the lpr command.

QDoes a network print server need a large cache memory to spool
print jobs?

ANo, a print server does not work as a spooling device. It passes
the data directly to the printer. If the printer is busy, the
network operating system takes care of the situation and the print
jobs are spooled on different locations depending on which print
method is being used. When printing via the file server, print jobs
are always spooled in a print queue. When printing peer-to-peer,
the print job is spooled locally on the PC's hard disk.

NETWORKS: Which Internet Server?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QI am sourcing for a suitable Intel-based Web server which would be
used in our company's intranet. I your view, how does Microsoft's
Internet Information Server compare with the other web server
offerings in the market?

AExcluding the various freeware and shareware web servers around,
there are basically four products that currently dominate the web
server market. These are: Microsoft's IIS, Netscape Communications
Server (NT Version and BSDI Unix Version) and Novell's Netware Web
Server. In terms of functionality, all the web servers support HTML
and standard CGIs (with the exception of Netware Web Server).
Netware does, however, support a proprietary extension called
Remote CGI (R-CGI). This allows the execution of CGI applications
on a separate machine from the Web server. It is different from
most CGI implementations which execute CGI applications in a
separate process on the same machine as the Web server.

In terms of API support, IIS and Netscape's Communications Server
(NT Version) both support ISAPI, NSAPI and proprietary APIs.
Netware does not support either ISAPI, NSAPI or a Novell defined
set of API to extend their web server (other than R-CGI).

According to tests conducted by Shiloh Consulting and Haynes &
Company, the Microsoft Internet Information Server substantially
outperformed the other Web servers tested on straight HTML and
proprietary APIs. This performance advantage increased consistently
as the number of clients making requests increased. The second best
performer in HTML tests was NetWare, followed by the Netscape BSDI
server and the Netscape NT server.

When running CGI, the best performer was the Netscape BSDI server,
followed by the Microsoft IIS. As should be expected, server
performance for two servers running on Windows NT (IIS and
Netscape) was virtually equal when 100 per cent of the requests
were for standard CGI. In this case, both servers spent a majority
of the time running identical CGI code, so very little time is
actually spent in the HTTP server code. Microsoft's API (ISAPI) is
roughly five times as fast as Microsoft's CGI. Netscape's API
(NSAPI) is roughly about twice as fast as Netscape's CGI. In tests
of the two servers with proprietary APIs, IIS was two or three
times faster than Netscape.

Even when the Internet Information Server was handling many more
HTML or API requests than the other servers, the average response
time for IIS to handle each request was significantly less. It was
approximately a quarter that of Netscape for straight HTML and one
third as great for 100 per cent API requests. When 100 per cent of
requests were for CGI, the Netscape BSDI server was substantially
faster than the Windows NT-based servers.

The superior performance of the Microsoft Internet Information
Server, which incidentally comes packaged with Microsoft NT Server
4.0 (and downloadable from Microsoft for NT 3.51), means that Web
site managers running HTML or API's on Intel platforms will find
Microsoft's server the best alternative for minimising hardware
costs, allowing a comfortable margin for peak loads, and providing
the maximum room for growth.

All tests were conducted on a HP NetServer 5/133 Model LS with 32
MB of RAM. The Netscape BSDI version tests were done on the same
machine but with 128 MB RAM. Novell tests were run with NetWare
4.1. IIS and Netscape Communications Server (NT Version) were run
on top of Windows NT Server 3.51, and the BSDI version was run on
BSDI Unix Version 2.01. A 100 Mbps network was used for the tests.
More information on the performance comparisons can be found on the
Internet at http://www.microsoft.

NETWORKS: ISDN to the Internet

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QI administer 22 users on a NetWare 3.12 network. I would like to
connect to the Internet, and I want to use ISDN. How do I set up
the ISDN connections? What software and hardware do I need? What
about security? Can I run IPX NETX at the workstation, or do I need
to run IPXODI and a VLM? Is there a better way to connect to the
Internet besides ISDN?

ATo provide Internet access, you should consider installing a
router-more specifically, an "access" router that supports ISDN-on
your network. Vendors preconfigure access routers to provide dial-
up asynchronous/synchronous services for LAN and remote users.
Cisco Systems, Bay Networks, and Ascend Communications all provide
router solutions. Make sure the router supports ISDN and that it
has enough ISDN ports to support your particular environment.

When you receive your router, configure it for IPX according to
vendor specifications. Without the IPX configuration, the server
and the router will not recognise each other.

If users need only infrequent access to the Internet or if you want
to minimise performance degradation when the LAN accesses the WAN,
you can implement a dial-on-demand ISDN architecture. With dial-on-
demand, traffic within the LAN is identified as special or
interesting. In this case, "interesting" means the traffic within
the network that causes the router to perform call setup functions.
A standard configuration might allow IPX to start the call setup-as
long as the IPX packets are not carrying RIP/SAP updates. You
should be able to configure all these parameters on the router. For
example, you can configure a Cisco router to identify IPX traffic
but filter and block the propagation of RIP/SAP updates.

Your servers and workstations on your current LAN require no
additional software. The connection between the router and server
is either direct or via a hub. The workstations' configurations,
assuming each has an IPX protocol stack, remain the same. Only
workstations requiring Internet services need Internet software.

Because you're running NetWare 3.12, workstation ODI and VLM
support should already be present. The workstation configuration
requires you to add an IP protocol stack to support ftp, Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or telnet (Virtual Terminal)
connections to the Internet. Remember that the Internet is a large
TCP/IP network and that its services are accessed using TCP/IP.
Novell's LAN WorkPlace for DOS or LAN WorkGroup software provides a
suitable IP stack for Internet access.

Security is handled at the router via filters and at the server via
NetWare security. Unless your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
suggests changes to your security configuration, you should be set.
Additional security might involve adding a firewall machine to
protect your network from outside intruders. CheckPoint Software's
Firewall 1 is a popular protection solution.

Hardware isn't all you need to access the Internet; you must also
choose an ISP. Some ISPs provide Internet addressing and a complete
suite of Internet connection options. Some might even suggest a
router solution for your environment.

WHERE'S THE CACHE?

QI've been told that the key to NetWare optimisation is to add more
memory. But before adding more RAM, I need to know how to calculate
the ideal amount of cache to support basic server operations.

AYou're right. Cache sizing is often the most beneficial
optimisation process you can perform on NetWare servers. The trick
is determining the right amount of cache for a particular server.

Unfortunately, the server memory calculations included in the
NetWare 3 and 4 documentation are outdated and, in some cases,
produce incorrect requirements. To avert this possible disaster,
take a look at two procedures that Novell has published.

The first procedure is a memory calculation worksheet that
estimates RAM requirements for new servers. The worksheet
incorporates factors, such as the server's volume parameters, NOS
features, and number of users, to produce the total memory
requirement for the server. If you're building a server with third-
party NLMs and additional name spaces, an option lets you add more
RAM requirements for these services. When you're finished with the
worksheet, you simply round the resulting estimate up to the
server's nearest memory configuration and install that much RAM in
the server. You can find the worksheet in "Calculating Memory
Requirements for NetWare 3 and 4," in the Novell Application Notes,
January 1995. An automated version of the worksheet, called
SMEM.EXE, is available in the NOVUSER forum of NetWire on
Compuserve.

The second procedure is a cache-tuning procedure for existing
NetWare 4 servers. Every server supports a different set of users
and applications; the workload they produce can significantly
affect the server's cache. In some cases, the estimate you derive
using the preceding worksheet can be several megabytes off. This
tuning procedure allows you to monitor the NetWare 4 least-
recently-used (LRU) Sitting Time Statistic in MONITOR.NLM and tune
the server's cache for its specific production environment. This
procedure is documented in "Tuning Cache with the NetWare 4 LRU
Sitting Time Statistic," in the Novell Application Notes, March
1995.

These procedures can also be found on the Web (http://www.
novell.com) and in Novell's Network Support Encyclopedia (NSE Pro)
on CD-ROM. To subscribe to the Application Notes or NSE Pro CD,

NETWORKS: Tools of the Trade

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

To ensure its technical support employees are well-versed in both
product knowledge and customer relations, WRQ requires all
potential technicians to participate in a three- to six-month
program called the Hatchery. This informal training program allows
"hatchlings" to learn about fielding support calls and the WRQ
corporate culture, which promotes treating people as assets and
giving employees freedom to do their jobs unencumbered, all without
a set schedule of courses.

LAN Mag: How many support technicians work for WRQ?

Walker: A hundred in Seattle, and we also have technical support
people in our European headquarters in Holland and in our
Southeast-Asia office in Singapore. In fact, because our sales are
through distributors, the main reason for our international offices
is for support.

LAN Mag: Do you feel that other organisations don't put that same
career-oriented spin on tech support?

Walker: I don't know specifically about other organisations, but
generally most people perceive technical support as being a burnout
job. A person normally would not think of making a career out of
technical support if they could avoid it. But that's not true here.

While the company has very low turnover in general, I think
technical support is actually our lowest turnover department.

LAN Mag: What types of resources and tools do your technicians have
at their disposal to help them look into some of the complex issues
that arise with connectivity software?

Walker: Well, a lot of people are not sure which parameters to aim
for when they're building in support because there are all these
different situations. There are simple questions, and, at the other
extreme, there are very complex questions. What we try to do is
take the attitude that first off, the customer support person is
supposed to have ownership of the problem. In other words, we don't
use really a multitier, escalation system. But if we have senior
professionals as tech support engineers, then once a problem is
assigned to them, they are there to own the problem.

In essence, they have the discretion to pursue the problem to the
end of the earth, if need be. That might be a sort of extreme case,
but in order to solve a problem that is very tough, you may have to
go back to the programmers of the product.

LAN Mag: Besides being highly trained, do the technicians have
copies of the products at their disposal or a simulated environment
set up at your offices?

Walker: They have a very generous allotment of hardware, and they
have access to every level of software up through the source. But
more importantly, technical support is actually proportional to the
developmental organisation. And that's a little unusual.

LAN Mag: So technical support is under research and development?

Walker: Yes. The technicians have access to the people that develop
the product. The frustrating thing that I have experienced as a
consumer is that in some organisations, there is no path between
the people who are doing support and the development of the product
itself. But, if a problem extends into the base functionality of a
product, there's nothing you can do.

LAN Mag: In developing your model for fielding tech support
questions, did you look at the competition?

Walker: We certainly go to a lot of conferences and try to track
what other people are doing. We try to adopt any kind of ideas and
systems, but it is a homegrown system that's been developed by our
company in response to our customers' needs.  LAN

NETWORKS: Build Support to Build User Loyalty

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Fifteen years ago, when the PC market was still in its infancy, a
group of individuals in Seattle shelled out US$500 and started
Walker, Richer & Quinn (WRQ). The company founders, including
current president, Doug Walker, and vice-president of product
development, Craig McKibben, saw the potential of the PC and its
interaction with legacy systems.

LAN Mag: Has the growing complexity of the networking world led to
the need for more technical support or a different approach toward
it?

Walker: When the PC started becoming commercially available in the
early 1980s, people were rebels; they were more self-supporting,
which represented a revolt against the big glass room with
mainframes and centralised IT.

They were circumventing IT as an act of rebellion. IT wasn't part
of the decision and also wasn't responsible for supporting any of
the new products.

In more recent years, because of the growing complexity of
networking and communications, people are ceding control back to
IT. Buying decisions used to be driven by individuals, then by
departments, and now it's by IT. Instead of a departmental decision
about software, you're making a corporatewide and enterprisewide
decision about buying a piece of software. Often those buyers are
very concerned about support, and that's one of the first things
they want to talk about. They are very, very worried about the
support, so when you do these contract negotiations to make one of
these big sales, one of the first things out of their mouths is,
'Let's talk about support.'

LAN Mag: Does that apply more to host connectivity software, such
as your Reflection line of products, especially since customers are
buying thousands of licenses to connect PCs or workstations to
enterprise systems?

Walker: Yes. It's usually the first word out of their mouths,
whereas back in the Wild West days it was more of an after thought.

LAN Mag: Why has technical support traditionally been an
afterthought?

Walker: The early adopters of PC technology were more self-
sufficient, and they took it upon themselves to deal with any
problems that would arise.

But I think the complexity has grown. When we started the company
up I was a programmer, and one of the really and truly fun things
about a PC was that you could understand everything in the whole
machine. Now it's just too complicated.

LAN Mag: Are you trying to use your mainframe background as a
competitive advantage in promoting your technical support and
services to customers, and do you feel that technical support plays
a big role when companies make a purchasing decision?

Walker: It's definitely a key differentiator.

LAN Mag: For the most part, is Guide Services the support that
you've offered all along, only now it has a specific name?

Walker: Yes, it's putting a name to the services that we have been
offering, and it also marks an introduction of some new services.
One of the reasons for putting this name on it, too, is to heighten
our customers' awareness that these services exist.

What we wanted to do under the Guide Services umbrella was include
what we call our Help Desk Plan. We wanted to be able to provide a
set of services that was particularly geared toward a help desk. We
wanted to create a flat-fee-based service plan that was based on
the installation size, set up a priority support team that could
meet some of the customers' specific requirements, give a
guaranteed technician response time, include product training, and
provide customers with technical information bulletins that give
depth of information greater than what other customers might need.

LAN Mag: How do you differentiate the Help Desk Plan from the
primary support plans of traditional technical support services,
which provide free, ongoing technical support?

Walker: The Help Desk Plan doesn't replace the traditional plan.
For most of our customers the traditional plan is quite sufficient.
But there were additional services that especially the very large
customers were asking us for, so we felt like we needed to design a
plan to provide those.

LAN Mag: With an internal help desk application, or even if you
outsource the help desk functions, a staff can solve a variety of
problems, not just those related to one manufacturer or one type of
product. Does your help desk follow along the same lines, or is it
exclusive to WRQ's Reflection line?

Walker: Well, we don't have training on other products, but one of
the things that's been a differentiator of our technical support
across the board has been our desire to support customers in their
environment. In other words, we didn't want to pass the buck; if
the customer called us up with a problem with another piece of
software, we typically try to remain the point of contact, try to
solve the problem with them, or in some cases call the manufacturer
of the troublesome software. Sometimes it's our software that's
causing the problem, but the customer doesn't always really know.
And the boundaries between your software and someone else's are not
always very well defined. So one of the differentiators for us is
that we've always been willing to have an extended view of where
that boundary is.

LAN Mag: Are your help desk technicians using software at their end
in order to keep track of the number of calls open and log them in?

Walker: We use software from Scopus for tracking problems. We also
use it for development as well. It's our bug-tracking tool; in
other words, if test engineers were testing a product, they would
run it through Scopus. It's an integrated system involving everyone
across our development organisation. Also, all of our international
offices are integrated on the same system. Then, we have a
knowledge base set up of instances, problems, and solutions. We use
Verity's engine to search that.

LAN Mag: From a support standpoint, do you keep records of each
customer as they call in? For example, if a company called today
and then again in six months with a similar problem would your
technicians be able to call up that record?

Walker: With Scopus' system, when someone calls in, it tracks the
case, and that record is an event of your problem. The record of
the type of problem as an archetype goes into this knowledge base
that we track with the Verity search engine. We even keep
individual cases; just because it's solved, it's not dead. We count
on the knowledge base to archive a case.

LAN Mag: In general what has been some of the feedback that you've
received from customers who've heard about your new offerings?

Walker: We've gotten a lot of comments back from customers. We also
did a lot of beta with key customers beforehand, so for a lot of
our key customers, the announcement was anti-climactic because so
many of them already knew about it. But, right now it looks like
the feedback is really good. I don't have figures on how many
people have signed up for this, but we're very pleased with the
results so far.

LAN Mag: How have you dealt with customers' normal frustrations
when they call a technical support line?

Walker: One of the things that's a bit confusing about support is
that consumers have different requirements, depending on what
they're doing. For example, if you just bought a word processor,
and you just typed up your story, and you wanted to print it, but
you couldn't figure out how, you might call the customer support
line. And you would probably like to know as soon as possible which
button to press to print the document. So the amount of time that
you spend on hold would be a key source of dissatisfaction. If they
said, "I'll let you know in a week," that might not do.

Similarly, if you have a mainframe or some sort of central server
or computer, people need hardware support. And, basically, if the
power goes down or the disk drive just died, you need the
supporting manufacturer or support organisation to get it back up.

It's more complicated if you're buying corporate connectivity
software. There are fewer of the "How do I print this document?"
calls. The nice thing about those calls is that they're not very
complicated, but the need for immediate response is high. It's more
typical in systemwide connectivity that the problem is very
complex, so the time element is different. It might be a problem
that requires weeks to solve or even may require onsite analysis.

LAN Mag: You discussed how tech support has changed over the last
15 years. What is your general opinion on the tech support
available today?

Walker: A lot of my own experiences are both prior to WRQ and
during the early years of WRQ, when I was doing consulting. When
you do consulting, you're putting together systems from different
vendors to create a workable system. And the biggest frustration
that I had, especially with software, was system problems. I would
get an intrinsic problem in some software and often the support
organisation that I would call had no way of dealing with it. It
was beyond the scope of their definition of support. It wasn't
whether their support was good or bad, it was not.

If [a company's] support is not so good, you can complain more and
jump up and down and raise more hell. But when it's not, it's
harder. And that's the toughest situation that I used to run into.
I think a lot of people who have been consultants have run into
that problem. So that may have been one thing that has coloured our
attitude toward not setting limits on a systemwide penetration of a
support call.

I think that problem is even more acute for people these days due
to the complexity of networking. Networking is such a huge issue
today, and it wasn't so much a few years ago. Right now, the
software that's causing the IT professionals to lose sleep and pull
their hair out is networking and the connectivity software.

LAN Mag: Do you see tech support, whether it's good or bad, as a
key factor in customers' company loyalty?

Walker: It certainly seems to work for us. I try as often as I can
to work on key sales situations. You'll run into situations
sometimes where it's a real advantage to compete with a company
that already is installed in a site if their support is bad, as
opposed to both companies arriving at the customer's site and both
claiming to have a great product and great support.

Let's say in this case the other company's product is already
installed and the customer discovered that the support was not so
good. Our support becomes a key way to make sales and close the
deal. It is definitely one of the key questions for customers.

LAN Mag: Some studies suggest that half of the cost of software
ownership is taken up by support. Does that mean customers are
paying that much for technical support services?

Walker: It's your own support infrastructure. In other words, what
does it cost to own a PC? A very elementary analysis would be,
'What are PCs going for these days?' But the truth of the matter
is, when you put all of the time of your support organisation out
there, it might be double that. Certainly we find that true in our
own organisation. The sticker price is only about half the story.
Support means more than your IS person walking around, loading
software, and upgrading software.

LAN Mag: Do you feel your approach to support services is unique in
the industry?

Walker: Our view of support is a differentiating point with us, and
WRQ has, from the beginning, looked at itself as a long-term
company trying to establish long-term relationships with our
customers. From the beginning, we've wanted to have this solution
orientation, and wanted to provide support to our customers to
build that relationship because we were taking a long-term view.
Our attitude toward tech support is that it's extremely congruent
with our overall business philosophy. If you're looking at the way
we do support, it makes it all very reasonable.  LAN

NETWORKS: GETTING WEB EXPERTISE?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

For those who are interested in getting a head start in Web
publishing but don't have the in-house expertise, Netframe Systems
has just introduced the ClusterServer 8560i, a fully-integrated
Intranet server solution.

"Most companies are excited about deploying on Intranet, but many
do not currently have the in-house expertise required to get
started, " said US-based Rob Van Naarden, VP of Sales, Netframe
Systems.

"All that the company's webmaster needs to do, is simply answer a
series of short questions in a standard wizard."

The new system comprises a high-capacity Netframe server, Intranet
tools, Web server software, Netframe's own Site Architect software
and a comprehensive range of templates, wizards, tutorials and
scripts. Using this suite of products, corporations can create the
structure for an Intranet and have their system on-line in less
than sixty minutes, claims Van Naarden.

The price of the server starts at less than US$25,000 for a fully
configured system, including software.

Users design their Web site with Site Architect and then add
content. Netframe even provides pre-formatted content for useful
Web information such as delivery tracking, airline and hotel
contact information.

Netframe's Intranet server is based on the company's ClusterServer
platform, Windows NT, the Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS), Microsoft Access database, and the Excite search engine, and
Netframe's Site Architect software.

Netframe has offices in Singapore, China, Japan, Hong Kong and
Australia.  LAN

NETWORKS: PCL 6 Speeds It Up

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The watched printer never prints. Instead, it sits calmly, lights
on, processing, taking its own sweet time-while you wait. For those
tired of the waiting game, Hewlett-Packard's (HP) new version of
Printer Control Language (PCL 6) decreases the downtime between the
print command and tactile gratification.

HP has been upgrading PCL since 1984, when the language was first
introduced to improve communication between laser printers and
workstations.

PCL 6 is designed for Windows and OS/2 environments that are
saturated with complex graphics. The Windows graphical direct
interface (GDI) commands are translated by the printer driver into
PCL commands, which are sent by the host computer to the printer
via the network or local parallel connection.

PCL firmware in the printer, in conjunction with the printer's
processor and memory, translates the PCL commands into dots. Then
the laser printer engine images the dots onto paper.

Complex documents print faster because the printer's PCL 6 firm-
ware and hardware process smaller, more compact object-oriented
commands for graphics rather than long strings of code sequences.

For example, using PCL 5e, 1,130 bytes are needed to print a
rectangle with rounded corners. PCL 6 prints the rectangle using 19
bytes, reducing the amount of traffic.

PCL 6 also allows users to regain control of their PC and
applications sooner because the printer driver quickly translates
the GDI commands to PCL 6.

Improved print quality is another aspect of PCL 6. Users get true
WYSIWYG printing because the PCL commands that define a document
map more closely to GDI commands, and the Windows printer driver
automatically downloads fonts within a document to the printer if
they are not loaded on the printer.

In addition, PCL 6 has complete backward compatibility. For the
benefit of users today, PCL 6 is currently included in HP's latest
range of LaserJet 5, 5N, and 5M laser printers.  LAN

NETWORKS: UB Networks Revamps Support

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

UB Networks may be in an iffy position with regards to its future
parent but it is toning up to remain in the business. Peter Ciceri,
vice-president and general manager of Asia-Pacific operations
recently let on that a comprehensive revamp of their customer
support programme was due.

At press time the sprucing up had barely begun but Ciceri promised
that UB faithfuls could look forward to a "channels-ready, end-user
driven support programme".

"We will concentrate on professional services, customer care and
post-sales support," said Ciceri. "End users can look forward to
even obtaining level one service direct from UB should they choose
to. Certified channel partners can provide up to level two support.

"The end user will determine who [the VARs or UB] he wants to work
with," said Ciceri. He added that directors for services and
customer care would soon be hired.

UB has been trying to establish itself outside of the high end
segment. Said Ciceri, "We need to take price cuts [in the mid- to
low-end] to build the market." However, Ciceri felt that UB was
strong enough at the high-end: "We have reset prices across the
region to meet competitor prices aggressively."  LAN

NETWORKS: Hughes Provides Satellite Link

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If the current crop of wide area connectivity options doesn't give
you the performance or speed you've been hoping for, NetWare-
centric users can now harness the speed of satellite communication
for applications such as broadcasting large files to a number of
locations and shared high-speed Internet access.

DirecPC for NetWare, jointly developed by Hughes Network Systems,
Helius, and Cisco Systems, builds on a standalone product released
by HNS in 1994. The networked version includes hardware from HNS,
ISA card for the NetWare server, Internet Junction IPX-to-TCP/IP
software from Cisco, and LAN-to-satellite integration software from
Helius.

DirecPC provides two services: Turbo Internet and Digital Package
Delivery. Turbo Internet allows users to dial in to their ISP
through a browser and send requests through a modem. The Digital
Package Delivery service provides a way to deliver data files to
multiple locations through a single broadcast at speeds of 3 Mbps.

NETWORKS: Olicom Raises Profile

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Denmark's Olicom is laying the groundwork for a drive into the
workgroup switching market with Token Ring, Fast Ethernet and 155
Mbps ATM hardware due out in early '97. Olicom, with regional
offices in Singapore and Hong Kong, has been established in Asia
for a couple of years, but has yet to be known outside of the Token
Ring sphere.

Michael Jonsson, vice-president of international sales, said that
this impression was going to change. First on the to-do list would
be an upgrade of all support services for the region to pave the
way.

"We need to build up the support programmes because we are not
prepared yet. We have a low profile in Asia-Pacific," said Jonsson.

"One part of the rejuvenated support plan involves more pre-sales
staff in Asia. They will help the end-user do testing for product
suitability and directly work with them."

For Level 2 technical support, Jonsson said that a central site
would be set up in Sydney by the end of the year to provide 24
hour, multi-language phone support. Customers would be given 1-800
numbers and calls would be automatically routed to open support
offices. "However, we believe that nine out of ten questions can be
solved by Level 1 support," said Jonsson. Olicom's distributors and
VARs would provide Level 1 support. Two of Olicom's VARs here are
ITS and Teledata.  LAN

NETWORKS: ManageWise Grabs NT and Java

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The story of ManageWise has always been about the expanding reach
of the management console, according to Prem Uppaluru, Novell's
vice president and general manager of the company's management and
administration division.

When Novell combined its NetWare Management System (NMS) with
Intel's LANDesk Manager in early 1995, the server-centric and
network topology functions of NMS were added to the primarily
desktop-oriented functions of LANDesk. ManageWise 2.0 incorporated
user administration into the product and also added features that
support management by third-party service providers, such as
integrators and value-added resellers.

Novell's management and administration division is currently
beginning to pass along the results of last year's initiatives by
delivering cross-platform networking services, rather than
proprietary file and print transport services. ManageWise 2.1, set
for release in the third quarter of 1996, extends the product
beyond the NetWare space. The new version includes a management
agent for NT Server that allows the ManageWise console to
configure, control, monitor, and troubleshoot the heretofore
foreign servers using the same interface and the same SNMP access
mechanism it uses for NetWare servers.

New client support in ManageWise 2.1 includes OS/2 Warp and Windows
95, and Windows NT Workstation support is due by the end of 1996.
Novell has restructured its relationship with Intel to eliminate
out-of-sync update problems, with Novell taking responsibility for
upgrading the ManageWise components; Novell will provide those
components to Intel for its separate line of LANDesk products.

Upgrades to ManageWise in 1997 will include a Web browser console,
which will provide cross-platform access to management and
administration data, and Java applets executing on NetWare servers
and on the browser system will deliver such capabilities as real-
time traffic monitoring and disk drive utilisation statistics.  LAN

NETWORKS: Novell Brings Out IntranetWare

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Convert the majority of its NetWare 3.x users over to Netware 4.11,
Novell has decided to launch IntranetWare in Asia. IntranetWare is
a bundling sweetener that will include the latest NetWare 4.11
(code-named Green River, NetWare Web Server, Netscape Navigator,
Web-site authoring tools and a multiprotocol router for WAN and
Internet connections.

"We are now making it very compelling for users to go on to NetWare
4.11. Previously, they may not have seen any real benefit upgrading
to NetWare 4, but today we are offering them ready components for
Intranet. With IntranetWare, users are only adding value to
existing network," said Derek Foo, Novell's managing director for
Singapore and S.E Asia region.

IntranetWare enables IT managers to choose how and when they want
to transition their corporate networks to intranets, by allowing
them to selectively install those networking components.

Novell is giving organisations a platform upon which they can add
ManageWise and GroupWise to create full-service intranets that will
include directory, security, file, print, management and messaging.

To access the intranet, users only need to launch the Netscape
Navigator browser from any desktop workstation and pass network
traffic to the server for IPX-to-IP translation.

Traditionally, network administrators had to install and maintain a
separate IP stack on each desktop to provide NetWare clients with
access to IP-based intranet or Internet services. Because IP is
only deployed on the IntranetWare server, administrators save time
and money by tracking and maintaining only one IP address per group
of users.

When organisations are ready to move to IP, IntranetWare supports
TCP/IP with dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and BootP to
ease IP address management. Future enhancements to IntranetWare
will feature full firewall and proxy cache capabilities. The
product will ship in October.  LAN

"incident" card for you to keep track of the number of times you
call HP. The packs are sold in 5- and 10-incident versions.

From their experience, HP says that 75 per cent of problems can be

NETWORKS: Continuity Plan

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The Singapore Computer Society has established a new sub-group (or
chapter, as they call it) in late August.

Called the Business Continuity Group (BCG), it aims to promote
Business Continuity as an essential component of business strategy.

As explained by group president Goh Moh Heng, Business Continuity
goes beyond disaster recovery which is merely the IT part of the
strategy.

Organisations with a Business Continuity plan can gain more time
for a total infrastructure revamp should disaster strike.

In the long run, the BCG also intends to tie-up with organisations
in the US or the UK to run examinations in Asia to certify BC
specialists.

Goh said that the affiliated organisation had not been decided yet
although one possibility could be the Disaster Recovery Institute
of the US.

At press time, a first conference was scheduled to run in Singapore
on Sep 30 as part of the BCG's activities.  LAN

NETWORKS: D-Link Rounds Out Customer Service

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

D-link is putting the final touches to a sophisticated 24-hour
customer service programme which it says will raise their
responsiveness several fold for both their VARs and end-users. "We
are now three months into the programme and field problems have
been drastically reduced by 50 per cent because of our problem
tracking system," said Henry Ngai, D-Link's vice-president of
marketing and customer support.

The new programme uses Australia as a global support centre with
Singapore as the regional support centre, and arms D-link support
staff with a Lotus Notes-based intranet for access to a
synchronised solution database and customer equipment purchase
records and problem logs.

Said Ngai: "If Australia logs off, customers can call the UK and
they would have the same records there. Databases are synchronised.
Calls can be forwarded to the different customer service units as
well. The nature of support is really trial and error." In the
past, each country maintained its own database of customers.

Said Ngai, "Problems have been promptly identified and support
staff can fax or download from the web."

The D-link support structure consists of 3 layers. Level 1 problems
are mostly to do with parameters and settings. These are non-system
problems. Level 2 engineers handle problem tracking and isolation.
Level 3 engineers fix the bugs and solve those problems which
cannot be solved in the field.

"We have relocated level 2 support into the testing labs. The
company has spent between US$5 to US$6 million on equipment and we
are sure that we can replicate all problems encountered in our
labs. In the past, some problems were not tracked," said Ngai.

At the centre of the programme is a new independent customer
service division (CSD), which controls customer service units in
each country. "Now, no matter what the query, the CSD will handle
the matter," said Ngai.  LAN

NETWORKS: Video Link Options

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Lucent's Multipoint Conferencing Unit (MCU), release 4.0 has been
introduced into the Asian market as ISDN services get ever more
popular and economical.

Features to be noted in this version are options for data sharing
through a video link, the expansion of four access ports to 64, and
to include four on-screen callers, with the ability to visually
link 24 locations on a single MCU or 46 locations between two
connected MCUs, which the sales support manager of Lucent's
business communications systems division, Lawrence Lee claims is
not offered by any other system.

"Through the feature of continuous presence plus we can deliver
this kind of switching, whereas our competitors can only view five
fixed locations with additional participants being heard, not
seen," he said.

The system is capable of transmitting voice, video, and data at
speeds from 112 to 1920 Kbps, supporting ITU standards H.320 and
T.120 for video and data conferencing respectively. Additionally,
release 4.0 is compatible with algorithms used on videoconferencing
systems from Intel, PictureTel, and Compression Labs.

According to Lee, the product is expected to be well accepted,
especially in markets such as Hong Kong where PRI ISDN is to be
launched by the end of this year, and in China where private
networks can avail of facilities such as videoconferencing.

Users may be interested to know there is an additional upgrade
investment plan, which allows the client to set up an annual or
monthly payment schedule for future upgrades, with automatic
updates of hardware and software once they become available.  LAN

NETWORKS: ATM Banks in China

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The LAN business unit of Datacraft China is about to construct
Shenzhen Development Bank's (SDB) entire branch networking
infrastructure based on ATM technology.

SDB has purchased Cisco's Lightstream 1010 switch, Catalyst 5000
and 3000 Ethernet switches, Cisco 7507 and 2522 routers, as well as
stackable hubs from Bay Networks. The system, which is to provide

The contract is worth US$680,000, the largest of the total four now
managed by Datacraft in the Guangdong province of China, with three
in Shenzhen and one in Zhuhei.

But although the LAN market-base in China is huge, the profit
margin is small, with so many vendors now fighting for market

NETWORKS: Get Management Tools

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

For those who are venturing out from the relatively safe
environments of host-based computing and the centralised management
view, now might be a good time to try client-server as the number
of systems management products are starting to surface in Asia.

Getting an application management product to integratewith your
existing network management platform is a good place to start. One
company which dabbles in apps management is Compuware.

Compuware has a line-up of mainframe management products but it is
their client-server range that catches the eye. Central to it all
are its Econet and Ecotools products which allow managment of apps
on the LAN/WAN and servers, respectively.

Ecotools work through polling agents residing in your distributed
hardware and offers event management, performance monitoring and
resource monitoring. Econet monitors apps traffic on the network
with RMON probes and can be set to notify you should thresholds be
exceeded. A modeling tool is included to allow you to test adds and
changes before any physical work is begun.

Compuware's international sales manager for Ecosystems, Gary Angel,
revealed that a new product, Ecoclient, would soon be available to
allow fault-detection and diagnosis on hung apps. "It would take
the terminal information and see which module failed. It can then
page you, trap information and show enough so that engineers can
fix the code," he said.

"Start to evaluate management tools today. Don't add apps and
servers first because it will get too messy," said Angel. "Consider
tools such as apps management first to get the apps up 100 per cent
of the time."  LAN

NETWORKS: Switches Rule!

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Industry consultant Tom Noelle, president of US-based CMI, predicts
that routers will eventually be replaced by switches."Users are
still going to have some performance determinism loss even if you
build a switched virtual core," says Noelle. "The funtion of a
router is inherently non-deterministic. A LAN switch is the only
solution that allow users to allocate resources specifically to the
application flow."

As compaines move into enterprise TCP/IP, many will develop a
requirement for central-policy management. "A user can't just
request for any amount of bandwidth," said Noelle. "Some mechanism
has to inform the network how much bandwidth to allocate."

By moving into policy-bandwidth management, the industry is
drifting away from the concept of routers. Routers were designed
with the idea that end-systems decided what they were going to send
and the network just carried it.

Cisco realises that the router is doomed as a strategic device,
which is why it is now moving into the switching arena.  LAN

NETWORKS: MORE ROUTERS TO THE EDGE, BUILD ATM CORE

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If you want performance determinism, then you don't want routers.
This is the view taken by Tom Noelle, president of US-based CIMI, a
network consultancy firm.

A router, according to Noelle, is simply nothing more than a
connectionless device. "Routers do not allow users to allocate
resources to a particular information flow in a way that's really
effective," said Noelle

"If I have an e-mail and video flow through a router, it doesn't
know the difference between the two and can't give one of them
priority over the other."

So does this spell the death of routers in networks? Apparently,
not just yet.

Router vendors are working hard to improve this. There's now a
protocol called RSVP or Resource Reservation Protocol that is
supposed to provide the prioritisation of important traffic flows.

"The only problem with RSVP is that it's easy for routers to make a
reservation but it's hard to fill one. In terms of implementation,
what do you do in a router to make this flow work better that that
flow," said Noelle.

The solution is to have a check list to see which particular flow
should be given priority. However, this can be very time-consuming
especially if you have a very long list.

Router vendors have also come out with the solution of sticking a
virtual circuit processor on the router to make their routing
process more efficient. "But even if you do this, you are still
routing," Noelle cautioned.

Cisco's architecture like NetFlow, for example, builds virtual
circuits with a packet processor that runs underneath the router to
reduce the amount of information the router handles.

"The only way to make a router deterministic is to stop making it a
router. So why not go the rest of the way by not having it there to
start off with," said Noelle.

Users should instead consider LAN switches. Routing could exist
only at one place in the network and that is where a connectionless
LAN has to be connected into a virtual circuit infrastructure,
according to Noelle.

"My advice is to build a virtual circuit core with Frame Relay or
ATM switching and push all the routers to the very edge of the
network. Once you've done that, begin to replace them with LAN
switches on a phase by phase basis," said Noelle. "Use routers only
where you don't have any performance problems."

The router, added Noelle, will eventually become a small low-cost
device that's subservient to the ATM network, instead of the
building block of the network itself, added Noelle.  LAN

NETWORKS: LAN MAGAZINE: EDITORIAL: A New Frontier

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Having a bold vision alone is just not enough.

What sets Malaysia apart from the rest of the pack, is its
willingness to take a risk on leading-edge technologies. With the
nation's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) taking shape and with the
merging of telecommunications and networking technologies, Malaysia
and the rest of Southeast-Asia can be assured of contributing and
having a major impact on the world in the future of networking.

Even non-IT business executives are trying to grasp the concept of
the MSC, envisioned by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. But what
will ensure its success, as Oracle's chief operating officer Ray
Lane correctly points out, is the clarity and vision of this
concept.

A concept where attitude becomes a competitive advantage. And
Malaysia, he adds, is the first institution that has put forth
attitude in these critical factors for competitive advantage. The
PM of Malaysia, himself, is personally taking an aggressive role in
pushing IT into government institutions and universities.

Critics say that the Multimedia Super Corridor serves merely to
prolong the life of the country's booming economy. And they are not
wrong. Besides cheaper labour and lower operating costs, Malaysia
is also offering extremely attractive incentive schemes to lure
companies to relocate their headquarters, R&D as well as
manufacturing facilities along the MSC.

But more importantly, Malaysia aims to be the technology showcase
for the Asian region. Plans are in the pipeline to build individual
state networks and eventually link all thirteen states
electronically.

For a start, universities are now in the process of implementing
the latest high-speed networks such as ATM.

Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia just purchased 68 Centillion 100
Multi LAN/ATM switches from Bay Networks. The number of switches
installed across the campus is expected to make UKM one of the
largest ATM sites in the world. The network today connects about 40
buildings, covering more than 8 square kilometers of the campus.

But mind you, the UKM network is only part of a strategic nation-
wide push by the Malaysian government to network within the
community and leapfrog into the age of digital economy.

Riding the same route as the Internet, ATM networks will first
spring from universities and eventually, spread into the commercial
arenas through joint projects and partnerships .

Other early adopters of ATM are the technology parks, as they'll be
the first homes for new multimedia developers that will move into
the MSC. Hi-tech companies will want to run their sophisticated
systems and development tools on high-speed networking technology.

Ironically, the recent Kuala Lumpur City Centre project did cause a
stir among some ardent proponents of ATM. Imagine KLCC, Malaysia's
pride and joy, was going to use FDDI for its backbone, they
muttered.

"Why would anybody want to use such an outdated technology," said
one puzzled senior executive from a US-based networking company.
"Not only can it not carry multimedia traffic, in real terms, FDDI
is also very expensive. If anyone is looking for a backbone
technology today that is proven and stable, ATM is the obvious
solution."

However, conservative users contend that many of the major ATM
specs are still not out yet and that any "standard-compliant" ATM
products available today are somewhat proprietary.

Still, whoever wins the KL project (which is estimated to be in the
region of US$100 million) will be basking in the limelight. It's a
massive undertaking that's never be done before in the world, say
industry observers.

Like it or not, all eyes will be focused on Malaysia for the next
couple of years. Networking vendors are looking to Malaysia not
only for an ATM testbed but for other riskier technologies; and
later, hopefully, a shining example for the rest of the region to

NETWORKS: LAN MAGAZINE: EDITORAL

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

As trade journalists, if there is one thing that we abhore more
than having to get into the office before ten in the morning it is
the bundle of phrases that fall under the banner of technospeak.
You must know them: the technical acroynms eg. SNMP, 100Base-T,
segmentation, RMON, agents and LAN Emulation. Or the concept jargon
where one word or phrase supposedly explains a sheaf of network
topologies eg. VLANs, SMP, Switched Workgroups, intranet. All a
kind of industry shorthand to be shared and bandied around among
those in the know.

To explain to users and network manager how the many new hardware
products fit in with existing networks, our writers most of the
time have to get to the very basics of a concept usually dunked
before them wholesale by the vendors, who also do their utmost to
convince us that their product does everything well. And even match
the colour of the carpet.

This is where the shorthand technospeak of the networking industry
kicks in. But what we are worried about is a new range of phrases
which are being shoehorned into the networking industry from the PC
world.

If you have been to enough seminars, you will know that the phrase
"total solution" is used far too liberally. The top hardware
vendors are guilty of this. Everyone claims to be a total solution
provider, and yet they have only recently acquired new companies to
fill out gaps in their product line up.

Plug-n-Play is another phrase that is totally inappropriate for the
networking world. And yet vendors just entering the small
office/remote office market are throwing this around to add glitz
to their new range of hardware. We even encountered sales managers
from the most well known router company who said, with a straight
face, that their new routers for this market were PnP. We fail to
see how configuring router tables can be an easy process. Perhaps
the sales contract includes free foreign labour.

In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king. In the land of
networking, snowjobs are increasing. Nowhere more so than in Asia
where certified NetWare professionals remain in shortsupply and
where UTP cabling is left to pullers without installation
certification at all. Where some with NetWare and TCP/IP basics, a
couple of years under his belt and a knack for Adobe Pagemill and
MS Word 6 can profess to be an intranet consultant. (We kid you
not)

We dare say that most of the time the vendors don't help either.
Maybe you caught the shifty dealings of the most well known NOS
vendor last month when another trade journal exposed its selective
manipulation of analyst data to place itself higher in the market
share stakes. Apparently the Microsoft marketing hoopla method is
being studied by competitors as well.

And the BS shovelling is not confined to salesmen. Visiting senior
executives can fall under the spell as well. Our latest encounter
was with a networking NIC vendor whose CEO popped into town for a
visit. On being asked about their business in Asia, he gave the oft
heard dazzle about how Asia is their fastest growing market, how it
will be their largest soon, blah blah.

What the executive did not realise was that the journalist
interviewing him before us was a close colleague of ours who had
grilled him to admit that his Asian market share had actually been
falling by more than a couple of percentage points since the year
past and that there had been difficulties with the authorities in
obtaining type approval.

The bottom line really is not to look for how cheap the product is
or how well the company name is lit in neon. The days of vendors
merely moving boxes in volume is not that far behind us. The only
real benefit is that networking technology does work.

So as you settle in with this latest offering from the Miller
Freeman publishing group, keep us in mind. We welcome all news and
letters, gripes and tips. Call or e-mail to aptnet@singnet. com.sg
and help us eradicate the snowjobs.
