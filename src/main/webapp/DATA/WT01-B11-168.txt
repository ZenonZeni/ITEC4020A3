<B>Proposed Expansion to Wabakimi Provincial Park<BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="w1.jpg"></CENTER><P><BR>
The Ministry of Natural Resources proposes an expansion to Wabakimi Provincial Park from 155,000 hectares to close to 900,000 hectares.  After expansion, Wabakimi Provincial Park will be the largest area of protected boreal forest in Ontario and the second largest provincial park (Polar Bear being the largest). The proposed boundary expansion will add substantially to the conservation values already included within the existing Wabakimi Provincial Park boundary, without compromising established recreational and tourism uses.<P><BR>
