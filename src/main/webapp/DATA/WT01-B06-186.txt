  Squeezing Children to Make Orange Juice, Tomatoes and Rasberries
</H1>
<P>
<P>
<B>While oranges, tomatoes and raspberries are loaded with vitamin C, they
can often be harmful to children. Though doctors recommend eating fruits
and vegetables, few would recommend that young children work in hot fields
picking and packing them. Yet thousands of children pick oranges in Mexico
and Brazil, tomatoes in Mexico and raspberries in Guatemala. These fruits
and vegetables are widely available at your neighborhood grocery store, but
are not usually marked with their country of origin.</B>
<P>
<B> Brazilian and Mexican orange juice is pouring into many juice products
that appear to be American. A number of American companies hide their imported
juices, including those made from oranges picked by children, in juices made
from concentrate. Tropicana fresh juices are made by adults in Florida, while
Tropicana orange juice from concentrate contains oranges picked by children
in Brazil and Mexico. Similarly, FloridaGold orange juice from concentrate
contains Brazilian juice, squeezed from the labor out of young children.
</B>
<P>
<B> A complaint was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concerning
FloridaGold orange juice's deception of consumers about its country of origin.
But the FDA didn't think mislabeling of orange juice was a matter of public
importance and has allowed the complaint to languish.</B>
<P>
<B> But consider this: According to the United States Department of Labor,
children picking and boxing oranges in Brazil are paid $3.00 for working
a 14-hour day, or 21 cents per hour. Tomatoes from Mexico are allowed to
contain the unhealthy pesticide DDT, though the United States banned the
use of DDT on tomatoes and other agricultural products more than ten years
ago. While the federal government warns Americans not to eat fresh fruits
and vegetables in Mexico, and South and Central America, this same produce
is sold at grocery stores across the United States.</B>
<P>
<B> Not only are many agricultural imports picked by children, they may also
be tainted with dangerous parasites and bacteria. Recently the source of
cyclosporin was traced by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) to
raspberries grown in Guatemala. Because of cyclosporin infections from these
raspberries more than 850 Americans became ill, suffering from severe diarrhea.
The CDC points to contamination in the water in Guatemala as the likely source
for this infection. This jibes with the State Department's warning to travelers
in Central and South America to avoid eating fruits and vegetables from all
these countries except Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. The State Department
warns: "Diarrhea caused by contaminated food or water is potentially
serious."</B>
<P>
<B> The unsafe and unsanitary working conditions under which young children
are laboring can be hazardous to their health and to your own health. Both
your conscience and your stomach should be wary of consuming fresh produce
and juices from Mexico, Central and South America.</B>
<P>
<B> If the government warns you not to drink the water or eat fresh fruits
and vegetables when you travel to Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, shouldn't
consumers be warned to avoid the very same fruits and vegetables when imported
into the United States? At a minimum, the federal government should require
that grocery stores label fruits and vegetables with their country of origin
so that consumer are fairly warned and can avoid possibly disease-laden
produce.</B>
<P>
<B> In addition, many of the contaminated raspberries from Guatemala were
picked by children. But it not the children that make these berries dangerous,
it's the unsanitary conditions under which they are grown. Often sanitation
is rudimentary. Outhouses are near the fields and many illnesses are spread
by these unhygienic conditions.</B>
<P>
<B> The related problems of child labor and unsafe produce needs to be attacked
on several levels. First of all, Congress should pass a law banning the
importation of products made by children under the age of 15. Congressman
Chris Smith (R. N.J.) has recently introduced this legislation (H.R. 3812)
which would enact this ban. This bill has been sponsored by six members of
Congress, three Democrats and three Republicans. </B>
<P>
<B> Secondly, federal law should require the clear labelling of all produce
for its country of origin. No legislation is currently being considered to
require this consumer notification, but consumer groups are now working on
various proposals. Write to your Congressman and Senator voicing your approval
of the legislation which prohibits the importation of products made by children.
Support legislation requiring country of origin information on fresh fruits
and vegetables. And drink your orange juice fresh squeezed.</B>
