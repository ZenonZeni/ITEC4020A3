<P>



What is Clozapine?



<P>



Clozapine has attracted interest and curiosity from many



consumers and family members. The drug was approved for the



treatment of patients with severe and persistent schizophrenia,



who either have not adequately responded to, or cannot tolerate,



standard antipsychotic drugs.



<P>



Sandoz Pharmaceuticals manufactures and markets clozapine under



the product name Clozaril.



<P>



What is new about clozapine?



<P>



Clozapine has unique benefits and unique risks. The benefits make



it the first major innovation in anti-psychotic drugs since the



introduction of neuroleptics nearly thirty years ago. The system



designed to manage the risks associated with clozapine use make



it an innovation in treatment modalities.



<P>



How long does it take patients to respond to clozapine?



<P>



Often patients respond in as little as a week. Some may require a



much longer period, and many of those who do show the greatest



improvement. About six months is a good trial period. Once a



patient responds, he/she may continue to improve for up to a



year.



<P>



What are the benefits?



<P>



The benefits of clozapine are its superior effectiveness and its



unique side effects profile. It treats the positive symptoms of



schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, blunted affect,



and hostility better than any other drug.



<P>



It is also the first drug which effectively treats the negative



symptoms -- apathy, withdrawal, blunted emotional response, and



anxiety.



<P>



It accomplishes this with 30 to 60 percent of the patients who



were previously considered refractory, that is patients who were



unresponsive to standard antipsychotic drugs.



<P>



Clozapine has virtually no incidence of the muscle spasms,



cramps, and posturing movements common to neuroleptic drugs, and



minimal incidence of the less serious neurological side effects



such as restlessness, muscle rigidity, and tremor. Nor has there



ever been a case of tardive dyskinesia associated with clozapine.



<P>



What is tardive dyskinesia?



<P>



Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disfiguring side effect which is



characterized by involuntary movements such as grimacing, sucking



and smacking of lips, and spasmodic movements of the extremities.



<P>



For every year that a group of patients is on neuroleptic drugs,



four to five percent develop TD (20-25 percent, for example,



after five years).



<P>



In the past, tardive dyskinesia was thought to be irreversible.



The symptoms of TD patients who are put on clozapine, however,



sometimes diminish, disappear, and do not reappear if they are



withdrawn from clozapine.



<P>



How can clozapine treat both positive and negative symptoms



better than any other drug?



<P>



Clozapine poses a unique risk. Consequently, the FDA would not



approve the drug unless its effectiveness could be proven clearly



superior to that of current antipsychotic drugs.



<P>



This was done conclusively in a 16-center study involving over



300 severely ill patients. These patients had all been ill for



many years and had failed to respond to at least three potent



drugs.



<P>



What is the "unique risk"?



<P>



Approximately two percent of patients who take clozapine will



develop a condition called agranulocytosis. The white blood cell



count drops to such a low level that the patient becomes



extremely vulnerable to infections and no longer has the ability



to fight them off.



<P>



Isn't agranulocytosis associated with standard antipsychotic



drugs as well?



<P>



Yes, but the incidence with clozapine is over 10 times that of



other neuroleptics.



<P>



Is agranulocytosis fatal?



<P>



If detected early enough, the condition can be reversed by simply



withdrawing the patient from clozapine. If it goes undetected



until infections develop, the patient can die. A number of such



deaths occurred outside the U.S. before the link with



agranulocytosis was understood.



<P>



We now know that to maintain patient safety, we must check the



patient's white blood cell count each week.



<P>



Is there a way to minimize the risk of clozapine?



<P>



Yes. Patients must have weekly blood tests, and the results sent



to the patient's pharmacy before the next week's supply can be



picked up.



<P>



Are other risks associated with clozapine?



<P>



Other serious side effects include seizures, lowered blood



pressure, and increased heart rate. Seizures are also common to



all antipsychotic drugs, but in the higher dosage ranges they are



much more prevalent with clozapine.



<P>



Lowered blood pressure and increased heart rate can usually be



managed by gradually increasing a patient's clozapine dosage from



an initially minimal level.



<P>



Money Available for Clozapine



<P>



Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., manufacturers of the medication



clozapine to treat schizophrenia, has settled an anti-trust



lawsuit over marketing the medication by agreeing to pay $21



million to increase access to the drug.



<P>



All 50 states sued the pharmaceutical corporation in 1990



because, until 1991, the drug was distributed only if patients



also purchased a blood monitoring service from a Sandoz



affiliate, Caremark Inc. The drug and the blood monitoring



together, under the Sandoz plan, cost $9,000 a year per patient.



<P>



Under the settlement agreement, Sandoz and Caremark will rebate



$38.92 a week, or $10 million to clozapine users, $3 million to



the states to pay for new patients who might benefit from the



medication, and $3 million to the National Organization for Rare



Disorders to provide clozapine scholarships for indigent



patients. Another $1 million will pay for patients in Veterans



Administration hospitals and other facilities. About $4 million



will go to legal fees.



<P>



Both parties declared victory in the settlement agreement.



<P>



<blockquote>"This is one of the highest monetary awards for an anti-trust



settlement that we've ever achieved," said Jim Spencer, special



assistant attorney general in Minnesota who led the plaintiffs.</blockquote>



<P>



<blockquote>"The lawsuit was dragging on and on, and the settlement is less



than our legal fees would have been if we had continued to pursue



the case," said Gil Honigfeld, director of scientific affairs for



Sandoz. "We have a long history of providing medication to people



who can't afford it.</blockquote>



<P>



In addition to rebates for patients and vouchers for state mental



health agencies to buy more clozapine, Spencer said the



settlement requires Sandoz to share its research database with



researchers for other pharmaceutical firms who may develop a



financial competitor to Clozaril, the Sandoz brand name



for clozapine. Sandoz has an exclusive patent on the drug until



September, 1994.



<P>



The average cost of clozapine and blood monitoring is now $100 a



week, down from $172 a week under the old arrangement, Spencer



said. The price is based on $2.85 per pill, or 400 milligrams a



day, the most common dosage. But Honigfeld said the price of



clozapine and blood monitoring have actually increased in some



areas of the country since the drug was separated from the



Caremark blood monitoring system.



<P>



Now the drug costs $4,160 per year for the typical dose,



Honigfeld said. Weekly blood monitoring, which is essential to



prevent blood clots, can cost $4,900 a year.



<P>



Spencer said clozapine use is not nearly what it should be



because Sandoz keeps the price too high. Sandoz has estimated



that more than 200,000 people could eventually benefit from the



drug.



<P>



Honigfeld said clozapine use in the United States has nearly



doubled in the last year. More than 30,000 patients now benefit



from the drug, according to Sandoz records. In Massachusetts, for



example, 28 percent of the people who could benefit from the drug



are receiving it.



<P>



In Louisiana, however, only 3 percent of the people who could



benefit from clozapine are receiving it. By the time Sandoz's



exclusive patent on the medication ends in 1994, Honigfeld



projects that 60,000 patients will be using it.



<P>



Clozapine has been especially effective in treating people with



schizophrenia who do not respond well to other medications. 



<P>



Honigfeld believes clozapine is one of several medications to



come in the next decade that will treat mental illness more



effectively, with fewer side effects.



<P>



The official settlement of the lawsuit is expected at the end of



November, and Honigfeld said checks and vouchers should be



arriving by the end of 1992.



<P>



What You Can Do



<P>



1. The National Organization for Rare Disorders has a number of



new scholarships available for recipients of clozapine. To apply,



call 1-800-937-6673, or write NORD-Sandoz Clozaril Assistance



Program, P.O.Box 8923, New Fairfield, CT. 06812.



<P>



2. Contact your state attorney general's office to ask about



additional money for clozapine. If you can't get an answer from



your state, you may call the chief attorney in the lawsuit, James



Spencer, special assistant attorney general of Minneapolis, Minn.



at (612) 296 3353.



<P>



3. Sandoz now funds an independent administrator, Heffler & CO.



CPAs of Philadelphia, PA, to work with families who received



Clozaril through the Caremark system. The administrators work to



reimburse families for their expenses during 1990-91. To contact



Heffler, call 215-665-8870.



<P>



4. If you or someone you know has experienced problems with



psychiatrists, pharmacies or laboratories in relation to



Clozaril, you can contact Sandoz directly. Sandoz representatives



have offered to inquire on behalf of patients and their families.



The toll-free number for Sandoz is 1-800-631-8184.

<A NAME = "doesc"><H2>DOES CLOZEPINE ALLEVIATE FACIAL . . .</H2></A>



<P>



Does Clozepine Alleviate Facial Tics, Body Tremors?



<P>



by Allan Safferman, M.D. and Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D.



<P>



Safferman is research psychiatrist at Hillside Hospital, Long



Island Jewish Medical Center, in Glen Oaks, NY. Lieberman is



director of research in the Department of Psychiatry at Hillside



Hospital.



<P>



One of the major concerns associated with the chronic use of



neuroleptic drugs is the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD),



an abnormal, involuntary movement disorder that can affect the



facial region, the trunk, and the upper and lower extremities.



<P>



The incidence of TD varies in different populations: in non-



elderly adult psychiatric patients it occurs in 18.5 percent



after four years of neuroleptic drug treatment, and in 44 percent



after eight years of treatment.



<P>



Among the elderly, the risk of TD has been found to be over 30



percent after 43 weeks of neuroleptic drug treatment.



<P>



Abnormal movements may be caused by a variety of neurological



illnesses, and the clinician should carefully consider and



exclude other reasonable possibilities before making a diagnosis



of TD. 



<P>



The majority of TD cases are mild, and if caught in time, are



reversible.



<P>



But a small percentage of patients may actually pose a medical



risk to the patient. The movements are often cosmetically



disfiguring and may be functionally disabling.



<P>



Patients with TD may be embarrassed by these movements and their



presence may cause anxiety and alarm to patients. These patients



may be shunned by those who are ignorant about this neurological



problem, thereby hampering the patient's efforts to reintegrate



into the community.



<P>



If anti-psychotic medications are discontinued early at the onset



of TD, a significant number of patients will spontaneously



improve and perhaps even remit after a few months.



<P>



Unfortunately, for many patients, neuroleptic discontinuation is



not a viable option as the relapse rate for patients suffering



from schizophrenia exceeds 60 percent and 80 percent after one



and two years of medication respectively.



<P>



Various efforts to treat TD have been met with inconsistent



results. Some of these measures have included: benzodiazepines,



lithium, bromocriptine, tetrabenazine, reserpine, lecithin,



clonidin, and high does anticholinergics, to name a few.



<P>



Some recent intriguing approaches have included the use of



Vitamin E, and selegiline.



<P>



It appears that all medications that block D-2 dopamine receptors



in the brain have the potential of producing extrapyramidal



symptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity) and may cause TD.



<P>



Clozapine is very interesting in this regard. Clozapine has a



very weak affinity for D-2 dopamine receptors, and therefore,



rarely produces significant extrapyramidal symptoms at



therapeutic doses.



<P>



While there have been a few isolated cases of dyskinesias



associated with clozapine, in these instances patients had



received traditional neuroleptic drugs prior to clozapine. To



date, there have been no confirmed case of TD caused by clozapine



alone.



<P>



For this reason, clozapine is a very appealing drug in that it



can effectively control psychotic symptoms and yet has a very low



risks, if any at all, of producing TD.



<P>



It has been observed that moderate to high dozes of clozapine



(between 500 MG to 900 mg per day) may partially or completely



alleviate symptoms of TD -- especially in those patients with



tardive dystonia.



<P>



At Hillside Hospital in New York, we are currently conducting a



study to determine if clozapine is an effective treatment for



patients with moderate to sever tardive dyskinesia.



<P>



Preliminary results indicate that most of the TD patients show



dramatic improvement in their abnormal body movements.



<P>



This project is currently ongoing and we are seeking more



patients for this study to help us determine if clozapine merely



suppresses TD, treats TD, or spares the brain from intense D-2



dopamine receptor blockage thereby allowing spontanwous "healing"



of dopamine neurons in the brain.
