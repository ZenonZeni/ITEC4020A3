 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF MINERALS </H2>

  <P> Three different types exist, metallic, chelated and colloidal.   Metallic minerals are most commonly used in nutritional supplements, especially for the major minerals because larger amounts are indicated. They have the least degree of absorption. Chelated minerals are the next step up the ladder. The metallic mineral is "chelated" with an amino acid. The "mineral chelate" is more bioavailable.  Colloidal Minerals occur in nature as small particles that either are or can be easily dispersed in a dispersion medium. Plant Derived Colloidal Minerals provide the best of all worlds because they are colloidal in nature and are associated with natural plant tissues, giving them all of the advantages of chelated minerals and more. Erosion and unwise farming methods have made mineral-rich soil a rare commodity.  The result is mineral deficient plants and livestock, and mineral-deficient people.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ORGANIC HUMIC SHALE</H2>
<P>    The best quality plant derived colloidal minerals in the world are concentrated from the mineral rich natural organic humic shale in the Rockland Mine. About 75 million years ago, the Earth's mineral-rich soils produced succulent fruits, vegetables and lush forests. The soils contained at least 84 minerals, which is why some experts believe some trees grew ten feet the first year.</P>
 <P>   Plant and animal life was extremely healthy and it is believed that a major reason is a direct result of the plants' access to at least 77 minerals from the soil. This is a far cry from the number of minerals available from the average soil throughout the world today. As the lucious vegetation died, it accumulated in deposits. It was compressed or compacted so that all of the moisture in it was eliminated.  What remains today is a deposit of dried, prehistoric plant derivatives known as organic humic shale.</P>
<P>   This organic humic shale contains 77 plant derived hydrophilic minerals which are very small in size when compared to metallic minerals. Because the minerals in humic shale were assimilated by plants, they are naturally incorporated into the tissues of the plant and are more hydrophilic and more readily utilized</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLLOIDS AND COLLOIDAL SOLUTIONS </H2>
<P>Colloidal science is devoted to the study of systems in which finely divided substances (colloids) are dispersed within a medium. A colloidal system can be a solid dispersed in a gas, solid-in-solid, solid-in-liquid, gas-in-gas, gas-in-liquid, liquid-in-liquid. etc. A colloidal system is not really a solution in which one substance is totally dissolved into the other hand, a colloidal system it is not really a suspension either.  In a suspension, the particles of the substance being suspended are larger and remain in the solid state.</P>
 <P>   Some people do not realize that solids can be colloids. A colloid is one thing and a colloidal solution is another.  A colloidal solution is merely a system in which a colloid has been dispersed in a liquid. Most all of the so-called colloidal mineral nutritional products on the market today are liquids. Actually, most of them are not true colloids at all. They have been manufactured by extracting some source material such as shale, clay or sea bed with citric or some other kind of acid. In this process, the acid helps dissolve the minerals and breaks down much of the organic matter in the source material, which occurs naturally associated with the minerals.  This acid extraction can actually destroy the plant-derived colloidal nature of most minerals and trace elements.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE ROCKLAND PROCESS</H2>
 <P>   The proprietary low-temperature Rockland process uses only cool, contaminant free water.  By maintaining low temperatures, the integrity of the natural delicate state of plant derived minerals is maintained.  A major advantage of the finished product is that the super highly concentrated plant-derived colloidal material is maintained in its natural state and can be easily hydrated by water to become a colloidal solution.</P>
<P>    The humic shale is mined in the natural dry state as it has existed for millions of years.  It is then ground to smaller aggregates and placed in stainless steel vats, where it is leached slowly. No acids are used. Negative pressure is applied which makes the concentration more efficient at low temperatures. Only the water is removed and the solid plant-derived colloidal minerals are all that are present, but in a highly concentrated form.</P>
<P>    When the leaching is complete, the mother liquor contains 38.000 milligrams of the 7 major minerals and 70 trace minerals per quart of liquid. When dried, the colloidal powder is placed in capsules of 600 mg each so that one capsule is equivalent to one half ounce of liquid, in so far as mineral content is concerned.</P>
<P>   This unique method makes it possible to have a dry product that can be made into capsules containing high quality plant-derived colloidal minerals just as they were in their natural state. When swallowed with water, the minerals in Micro-Mins capsules readily return to their liquid colloidal state in the digestive tract and provide all the advantages of the liquid form without the disadvantages.</P>
<P>    Metallic minerals carry a positive charge in their ionic Form in solution and, in general, are just not very soluble. Scientifically, they are called hydrophobic because they are not very soluble in water. Minerals that have been assimilated by plants are hydrophilic, so they are very water soluble. They are negatively charged and form direct hydrogen bonds with water. Hydrophilic plant-derived minerals, which have not been destroyed by heat or acids or other chemicals, are enzymatically active and thus are highly bioavailable.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ALUMINUM IN OUR FOODS</H2>
<P>   Some people believe that the so-called toxic metals (minerals) are bad regardless of their source. Aluminum is found in the earth is, its metallic form. There is no question about its metallic form, which is well documented that it can be leached from aluminum cooking utensils and absorbed from antiperspirants and deposited in both brain and heart tissue. However, the aluminum, which comes from food, is hydrophilic as it has been assimilated by plants and it is naturally tied to oxygen or silica. The World Health Organization estimates the average adult dietary aluminum intake between 10 and 15 mg per day. Aluminum is one of the most abundant minerals on earth, second only to silica. It is in virtually everything we touch, most of the air we breathe and water we drink. It is in most foods that we eat.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE MICRO-MINS</H2>
