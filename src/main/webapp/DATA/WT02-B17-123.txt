<b>Photovoltaic Hydrogen Production;<br>

<P>

Electrical, thermal and total energy conversion rates were analyzed

for hybrid collector energy conversion, and annual hybrid solar

hydrogen production versus electrolyser temperatures up to 1200&#186;C

was calculated for Miami using a 2-D tracking system.  Plans were

made for cost analysis and cost comparisons of different types

of hybrid collectors, electrolysers, power regulators, and thermal

storage systems, and for the design of a new large-scale, 
high-efficiency

hybrid solar hydrogen system using high-temperature steam and

making use of all waste heat.

<P>

<b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b>

<P>

In April, we prepared material for presentation at the Hydrogen

Energy Program Review Meeting in Miami.  This included efficiency

comparisons of five different collector rotation systems for 
two-dimensional

hybrid parabolic collectors at Miami, and hydrogen production

comparisons for 2-axis, sun-tracking plain and hybrid collectors

at Miami and four other cities.
