<CENTER><B>Ontario Parks - A New Business Model for Ontario's Provincial Parks<BR>
FACT SHEET
</B></CENTER><P><BR>

The objective of creating <B>Ontario Parks</B> is to improve the delivery of programs and services in key parks to increase revenues and, in turn, to sustain other parks.<P>

<B>Ontario Parks Mandate</B><P>

<CENTER><I>"To protect, plan, develop and manage Ontario's system of <BR>provincial parks while improving their self-reliance."</I></CENTER><P>

This includes helping the province to establish new provincial parks and to safeguard the unique cultural, recreational and natural features of the provincial parks system through responsible land use planning.<P><BR>

<B>Ontario Parks</B> will fulfil this mandate by providing a variety of outdoors recreational opportunities to the public and providing natural and cultural heritage protection within the park system.<P>

There are four objectives for the provincial parks program:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the protection of significant elements of our natural and cultural landscape
<LI>the opportunity for exploration and appreciation of our natural and cultural heritage
<LI>the provision of recreational opportunities, ranging from day use to wilderness experiences
<LI>the encouragement of economic benefits through tourism.
</UL><BR>
<B>Ontario Parks</B> will balance the wants and needs of visitors for new services and programs, with a continued commitment to natural and cultural heritage protection.<P><BR>

<B>Business Objectives</B><P>

<B>Ontario Parks</B> has set the following business objectives:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Provide strong leadership in natural and cultural protection.
<LI>Improve customer service and market our products and services effectively.
<LI>Move toward financial self-reliance in the parks.
<LI>Operate more like a business.
<LI>Build management and workforce excellence in business operations.
<LI>Be a leader in building a new business model in government.
<LI>Involve the private sector in program delivery, from service contracts to park contracting to partnerships.
</UL><BR>
<B>Business Plan</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>A brand name for Ontario's provincial parks: <B>Ontario Parks</B>
<LI>A new visual identity will be developed.
<LI>The Minister of Natural Resources has the authority to establish a new board of directors.  The board will be chaired by the Deputy Minister.  It will have members from outside the Ontario government with interests in areas such as the environment, tourism, business, finance and education.
<LI>A special purpose account for retaining and managing park revenues (fees, licences, permits, rentals) will be developed.  It will improve customer service, maximize revenues and make park operations more efficient and accountable.
<LI><B>Ontario Parks</B> will be able to set or change park fees and charges, subject to the Minister's approval.
</UL><BR>
<B>Financial Projections</B><P>

<B>Ontario Parks'</B> business plan covers the five-year period 1996-2001. During that time:
revenues are expected to increase to $20 million from $15 million; and
cost recovery on operating and capital expenditures is expected to improve to 70 per cent from 45 per cent over the five-year period.<P> <BR>

<B>Ontario Parks Today</B>
<UL>
<LI>Today, Ontario's 265 provincial parks cover 6.2 million hectares. On average, parks receive some 8.5 million visits every year, with 20 per cent coming from outside of Ontario. <P>

<LI>Services offered in provincial parks include camping, picnic areas, visitor centres, museums, beaches, and trails for hiking, biking, skiing and snowmobiling.  In addition, popular programs include outdoor education, resource management and research.<P>

<LI>All parks are open to the public and offer a variety of day-use and camping facilities.  Of the 265 provincial parks, 105 are classified as "operating" and 160 as "non-operating".  Only operating parks have staff on site. However, facilities in non-operating parks are maintained, and the public is welcome to walk into the parks and enjoy most traditional activities.<P>

<LI>Fifteen of the current 105 operating parks are scheduled to become non-operating parks, unless suitable partners can be found or other cost-saving measures are implemented. This will achieve a saving of $515,000. The parks are Batchawana Bay, John E. Pearce, Lake on the Mountain, Lake Nipigon, Mark S. Burnham, Middle Falls, Missinaibi, Obatanga, Pakwash, Peche Island, Peter's Wood, Port Bruce, Potholes, The Shoals and Tidewater.<P>

<LI>In addition, 12 parks may be operated with partners.  This could provide a saving of $834,000.  The parks are: Caliper Lake, Driftwood, Fushimi Lake, Greenwater, Inverhuron, Kap-kig-iwan, Lake of the Woods, Marten River, Mississagi, Ojibway, Ouimet Canyon and Windy Lake.<P>

<LI>As part of the continuing process to bring greater efficiency and effectiveness to government program delivery, Ontario Parks will offer new opportunities for service contracts within provincial parks in 1996.  This will save the parks system approximately $1 million.<P>

<LI>Services that may be contracted include: road and ground maintenance, garbage disposal, janitorial services and snow removal.  Service contracts will be established through a public tender process.<P>
