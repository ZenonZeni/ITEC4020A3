By joining Student CEC you will have access to<I> TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>, <I>Exceptional Children</I>, and <I>CEC Today</I>, all quality publications loaded with information.<BR>
<BR>
 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- Student CEC is a great place for professional development.  State/provincial federations hold annual conferences.  Each division holds an annual conference, and you don't want to miss CEC's annual convention.   By attending these events either as a participant or a presenter, you will further develop yourself as a professional and be prepared to enter the field of special education.<BR>
<BR>
 NETWORKING -- By joining Student CEC you will have the opportunity to network with people from all over.  Involvement starts at the local level as you get involved with your chapter.  You will also have the opportunity to meet with well-respected professionals in your state or province during federation conferences as well as meet up with colleagues at the annual convention. <BR>
<BR>
 DIVISIONS -- By joining one of the 17 divisions, you have access to even more information.  Divisions focus on one area of specialization and will help you get the information you need to be successful in that area.  <BR>
<BR>
 EMPLOYMENT -- Student CEC provides you with access to jobs.  By networking with professionals in your federation or the divisions, you will learn about current jobs.  You can also contact the National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education for information on jobs.  And don't forget the Job Fair held each year during the convention.<BR>
<BR>
Over 11,500 students from throughout the United States and Canada belong to Student CEC.  They reap the benefits of membership each and every day.  Think about what you are missing by not joining.  Call 800/845-6232 for more information about membership opportunities or check out the membership section of this web page.<P>
 

<B>Student CEC Structure and Purpose<BR>
</B><BR>
The CEC Delegate Assembly authorized the development of Student CEC 30 year ago.  Student CEC, a program of CEC, is an association for all student members of CEC and is organized on both the state/provincial level and on the international level.  Its primary purpose is to "present students with opportunities to improve educational professional standards and increase awareness of exceptional children and youth," and it is "the focal point for the professional preparation of any student interested in services for exceptional children and youth," (Student CEC Constitution, Article II, Section I).<P>
<B>Student Membership<P>
</B>Anyone interested in the education of exceptional children and youth is welcome to join CEC as either student or regular members.  The student membership category is defined as those who are enrolled at an accredited college or university and not engaged in full-time employment in the education profession.  Students can join at a discounted rate and are entitled to the identical benefits, services, rights, and privileges of regular CEC members.<P>
<B>Student  CEC Chapters<P>
</B>Student chapters are formed at the local level, usually at colleges and universities with special education programs.  Chapters meet on a regular basis and organize programs and activities for and with individuals with exceptionalities.  Seventy-five percent of a Student CEC chapters' membership must be comprised of students, but faculty and professionals may join student chapters.  Students may also join regular chapters if they desire. Click on Student Chapters for a list of colleges and universities with chapters.<P>
<B>Student CEC Governance</B><P>
Every state or province with an organized federation or branch may form an association consisting of the student members in that state or province.  The association's student executive committee works with local Student CEC chapters to provide support and programming.  <P>
Each association may elect a governor to sit on the Student CEC Board of Governors.  The governors meet during the annual CEC convention to address issues relating to Student CEC and the education profession.  They also elect the Student CEC Executive Committee consisting of the President, Vice President of Committees, Vice President of Programs, and Vice President of Communications.  Programming and governance issues are addressed by these four officers.<P>
Finally, students comprise about 20% of CEC's total membership and bring a variety of perspectives and needs to CEC.  In recognition of this, the Student CEC President sits on the CEC Board of Governors.  <p>


<B>THE STRUCTURE OF STUDENT CEC<BR>
<CENTER><BR>
</B><BR>
</CENTER><B>STUDENT CEC MEMBER</B>The Student CEC member is the backbone of the organization.  Student CEC members are interested in the education profession or related services and in working with individuals with exceptionalities.

</CENTER>[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]<BR>
<CENTER><BR>
</CENTER><B>STUDENT CEC CHAPTERS</B>A student chapter consists of regular and student members.  Chapters can be located on a college or university campus and are a place to share talents, learn leadership skills, and  build relationships with other CEC members, special educators and exceptional children within the community. 
<p>
  <B>DIVISIONS</B>Student CEC members may join 16 of the 17 divisions which specialize in specific exceptionalities.  Joining divisions enables students to tailor their education to particular areas of interest.  Divisions may elect a student governor to sit on the Student CEC Board of Governors.<BR>
<BR>
<B>STUDENT CEC ASSOCIATIONS</B>An association consists of all student members in a particular state or province.  Associations provide programming ideas, coordinate efforts on the state/provincial level and elect officers to act as liaisons between the local Student CEC chapters and the Student CEC Executive Committee.<p>
<B>STUDENT CEC BOARD OF GOVERNORS</B>The Student CEC Board of Governors is made up of governors from every state and province with an organized association as well as from divisions.  Governors meet during the annual convention to share information, plan for the upcoming year, address governance issues and elect the Student CEC Executive Committee.<p>
<B>STUDENT CEC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</B>The Student CEC Executive Committee consists of four student officers elected to represent all Student CEC members.  These officers plan and implement programming for all members of Student CEC.<p>
<B>THE STUDENT COUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN</B>Student CEC was established to provide students with opportunities to improve educational professional standards and is the focal point for professional preparation of any student interested in services for exceptional children and youth.<p>
<B>THE COUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN</B>The Council for Exceptional Children is the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities - students with disabilities and/or the gifted.   <p>

CONSTITUTION & BYLAWS<BR>
<P>
</B>Chapters are governed by their constitution and bylaws.  This is an important document because it guides your actions as you make decisions.  It informs you about a quorum (how many people it takes to run a meeting); details officer responsibilities;  identifies your purpose; and helps make tough decisions.  <P>
Every chapter should have a constitution and bylaws on file with their chapter.  CEC Headquarters also keeps a copy on file.  <P>
As you prepare for the year, here are some steps to follow to ensure you are governing correctly:<P>
<ol>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your chapter.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your student activities office on your campus.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     If you can't find your constitution and bylaws, call CEC Headquarters at 800/845-6232 to obtain a copy.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Review your constitution and bylaws.  Most of them were written in the 1970's, so you may have some serious revising to do.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Call CEC Headquarters -- 800/845-6232 -- for a sample copy which you can use as a guide.  It contains all the up-to-date language required by the Delegate Assembly.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     You must follow the criteria set by the Delegate Assembly when updating or writing your constitution and bylaws.  This means you can always be more detailed in your constitution and bylaws but not less than what is required by the Delegate Assembly.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Once you have revised your constitution and bylaws, share this information with your chapter and vote to approve the changes.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Finally, send your new constitution and bylaws to CEC Headquarters so it can be approved and kept on file in your chapter folder.<BR>
<BR></ol>

<B>CHAPTER REFUNDS</B><BR>
<P>
<B>What is the Purpose of Unit Refunds?</B><P>
CEC has had a long tradition of proving a portion of each member's dues to his/her unit for support of its activities.  It's assumed that the more income a unit can generate without formal fund raising programs, the more time it can spend on member-related benefits and services.<BR>
<B><BR>
How are the Refunds Calculated?<P>
</B>June 30 and December 31 are important dates.  These are the dates when a determination is made regarding how many members within a unit generate the refund for that unit.  The refund for student members is calculated, based on the new or renewing members for the 6-month period, and a check is generated.  Again, it is important to know that the refunds are not calculated based on the member's original unit, but based on where he/she is on June 30 or December 31.  Example:  If a student member pays May 1, the member's refund would print on the August refund.  If a student member pays September 1, the member's refund would print on the February refund.<B><P>
How Much is Refunded for Student Members?<P>
</B>A total of $3.00 per student is refunded for each new membership or renewal.  Of this amount, it is divided as follows:  $2.00/chapter + $.25/federation + $.75/student association.  (If there is no student association for a state/province, the federation receives $1.00 per student member.)  If  a member does not affiliate with a chapter, the total amount is refunded to the federation --  so be sure to list your chapter number on all applications you pass out.<BR>
<B><BR>
When are Refund Checks Mailed?<P>
</B>Checks are mailed on August 15 and February 15 each year to treasurers of active chapters who have reported at least three current officers to CEC Headquarters Membership Program.<BR>
<B><BR>
How do We Know if the Check Amount is Correct?<P>
</B>The check receipt indicates the number of members reflected in the check.  To verify, check the "paid date" of each member on your membership roster (sent to the membership chairs each quarter).  You can closely match the members with paid dates from January-June with the August check or the members with paid dates from July-December with the February check.  The Membership Program staff is always available to answer your questions or to clarify any areas that seem fuzzy.  Feel free to call 800/845-6232, and we will walk you through the process.<P>
 
<B>DELEGATE ASSEMBLY<P>
 
What is the Delegate Assembly? <BR>
</B><BR>
The Delegate Assembly is CEC's legislative body.  It meets annually at the international convention.  President Diane Johnson will preside at all Delegate Assembly meetings in Orlando, FL where representatives from each chapter, branch, federation, and division make important decisions for the Council.  Some issues that delegates address relate to CEC's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; official Council platforms, statements of policy and resolutions; election of CEC officers; regulations and standards for CEC units; and membership dues.<P>
The Delegate Assembly traditionally holds two meetings during the annual CEC convention. <P>
<B>How Many Delegate Votes Does my Unit Have This Year?<BR>
</B><BR>
The number of votes your unit has this year is based on your total membership as of <B>June 30, 1995</B>.  This number is printed on a computer label found on the enclosed blue Delegate Registration Form which you will receive in December.<P>
<B>When are Delegates Registered?<BR>
</B><BR>
All delegates<B> must be registered by the very strict postmark deadline of February 29, 1996</B>, so please don't delay.  Send your Delegate Registration Form to Credentials and Elections Committee Chairperson Steve Smith (c/o CEC/MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM, 1920 Association Drive, Reston, Virginia 22091) as soon as you can to ensure your unit's representation.  Registration forms postmarked after the February 29 deadline will be returned and will unfortunately make a unit ineligible for participation in the 1996 Delegate Assembly.<P>
<B>Is it Difficult to Register?<BR>
</B><BR>
To register your unit's representative(s), fill out the blue Delegate Registration Form when you receive it in December, and mail it to Steve Smith, CEC/MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM, by February 29.  Be sure, however, that each delegate and each alternate does plan to attend the Orlando Convention on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 2 and 3, and are current CEC members.<P>
<B>Can Delegates/Alternates be Named if They aren't Affiliated with Our Unit?<BR>
</B><BR>
Yes.  It may be that members of your unit are uncertain whether they can secure leave time from their jobs or from their course work to attend the convention.  In such cases, you could name a member from a neighboring chapter, from your federation, or from your division to serve as your delegate or alternate. <p> BE SURE ALL PERSONS REGISTERED ARE CEC MEMBERS IN GOOD STANDING, AND THAT THEY KNOW THEY ARE REGISTERED TO REPRESENT <p>

YOUR UNIT.  They should also know the names of the other delegates and alternates,  how many votes each delegate carries, and the issues to be addressed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What Should Delegates do at the Convention?<BR>
</B><BR>
In Orlando, your unit's delegate(s) and alternate(s) should:<BR>
<BR><ol>
<li>     Go to the Delegate Credential's Desk located in the Registration Area, in the Orlando Convention Center during the specified times to check in and get unit votes validated.  This is done by stating the unit number and showing a convention badge.  Each delegate or alternate will be given a second badge to wear during the Delegate Assembly.  On the badge will be the number of votes for which the delegate is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Pick up the Delegate Assembly agenda when validating unit votes.  The agenda contains both action and information items that should be reviewed in advance of the assembly.  If the delegate or alternate has questions about any items, he/she should seek assistance from the federation governor, president, or from a division officer.  CEC staff persons can also answer questions.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Attend all Delegate Assembly sessions, making sure he/she can accurately report the assembly's decisions back home at the next unit meeting.<BR></ol>
<BR>

 STARTING A STUDENT CEC CHAPTER 
<P>
How to Start a Student CEC Chapter<P>
</B>Starting a chapter is easy.  Just follow these three steps<P>
<ol>
<li>     Call CEC Headquarters -- 800/845-6232 and order a chapter start-up kit.  This kit contains everything you need to get your chapter started.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Once you get the kit, look it over and do the following:<BR>
 Find 15 people to join your chapter.  These can be new members or current members who want to transfer into your chapter.  At least 75% of your members must be students.  The rest can be professors or other professionals.  <BR>
 Hold a meeting.  Set your goals for the year and elect officers.<BR>
 Complete the chapter application form listing your officers.<BR>
 Create a constitution to govern your chapter.  You can use the sample constitution and fill in the blanks or create your own.              <BR>
<BR>
<li>     Send the completed chapter application, constitution, and all membership applications and transfer forms to CEC Headquarters at 1920 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091.  Once we receive your packet, we will assign your chapter a number and approve your constitution.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<B>Why Start A Student CEC Chapter<P>
</B>There are many benefits to starting a Student CEC Chapter on your campus.  Here are some to consider:<P>
 Chapters provide students with the opportunity to gather together to network and learn from one another.  Chapters can conduct make-it-take-it workshops, invite in speakers, or hold discussions on areas of concern such as discipline, inclusion, or curriculum development.<BR>
<BR>
 Chapters conduct community service.  Student CEC chapters can plan activities for persons with disabilities and or those who are gifted.  This provide a mutual benefit since most organizations need willing volunteers and preprofessionals need experience.<BR>
<BR>
 Chapters allow colleagues to benefit from professional development.  Students can plan programs for the chapter or attend state/provincial conferences and the national convention.<BR>
<BR>
Chapters do a wide variety of activities.  For more information, check out the Student CEC Chapter Idea Page or call 800/845-6232.  Karen Vermaire Fox will be happy to help you get your chapter up and running.<p>

CONSTITUTION & BYLAWS<BR>
<BR>
 
</B>Associations are governed by their constitution and bylaws.  This is an important document because it guides your actions as you make decisions.  It informs you about a quorum (how many people it takes to run a meeting); details officer responsibilities;  identifies your purpose; and helps make tough decisions.  <P>
Every association should have a constitution and bylaws on file with their association.  CEC Headquarters also keeps a copy on file.  <P>
As you prepare for the year, here are some steps to follow to ensure you are governing correctly:<P><ol>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your association.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     Check to make sure you have a constitution and bylaws on file with your federation.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     If you can't find your constitution and bylaws, call CEC Headquarters at 800/845-6232 to obtain a copy.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Review your constitution and bylaws.  Most of them were written in the 1970's, so you may have some serious revising to do.<BR>
<BR>

STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN CAN</B> 
<P>
<B>What is CAN?</B><P>
CEC is committed to the effective implementation and expansion of public policy in the interest of children and youth with disabilities, those who are gifted, and the profession that serves this population.  CEC leads the way in advocating for individuals with exceptionalities and in improving the conditions and resources available to the educator. CEC pioneered the passage of P.L. 94-142 and continues to fight hard for key legislative wins relative to exceptional individuals.  Public policy legislation, litigation, appropriation, regulation, and agreements are the means by which individuals with exceptionalities are guaranteed the educational opportunities of our society.  This message is amplified by CEC's active political action network.<P>
The Children and Youth Action Network -- CAN -- is the active political action network of CEC, and we welcome your involvement.  We need student involvement in public policy, so that lawmakers on all levels are made aware of the issues facing children and youth with exceptionalities.<P>
<B>How Can I Get Involved?</B><P>
CEC welcomes your involvement on any level.  Both Student CEC chapters and associations are encouraged to elect a CAN Coordinator to serve on their executive committees.   The basic responsibilities of the CAN Coordinator are as follows:<P><ol>
<li>     Maintain contact with the federation CAN Coordinator and receive CAN updates.<BR>
<li>     Become familiar with current governmental issues.<BR>
<li>     Provide reports on legislation and other key policy issues at all meetings.<BR>
<li>     Get students involved in the political process to help support key issues concerning special education.<BR></ol>
<BR>
CAN Coordinators elected to state/provincial associations have the opportunity to attend a public policy workshop in the summer.  This workshop is designed to prepare CAN Coordinators to better do their jobs.  Training is also offered at the annual convention.<P>
If you are interested in learning more about public policy, check out the public policy section of this web page.  If you would like more information about trainings or leadership positions, contact Karen Vermaire Fox at CEC Headquarters.  Call her at 800/845-6232 or send an e-mail to karenv@cec.sped.org.<P>

<B>THE STUDENT CEC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE<BR>
<BR>
</B> 
<B>The Make-up of the Student CEC Executive Committee</B><BR>
<BR>
The Student CEC Executive Committee consists of 5 officers: President, Vice President of Committees, Vice President of Programs, Vice President of Communications, and Canadian Student Liaison (CSL).  The CSL is a nonvoting member of the Committee.   <P>
<B>The Responsibilities of the Student CEC Executive Committee</B><P>
<B>Kristy P&eacute;rez</B>,  a graduate student at Texas A&M University, is the Student CEC President.  While fulfilling the role of president, Kristy also represents Student CEC on the CEC Board of Governors and on the Finance and Operations Committee.  In her spare time, she serves as the CAN Coordinator for Student CEC.  Ultimately, her leadership affects everything from communication, to recruitment and retention, to the actualization of the Student CEC action plan.  <BR>
The Vice President of Committees is <B>Samantha Sexton</B>, an undergraduate student at the University of Winnipeg in Manitoba .  Samantha oversees the Student CEC standing committees, the steering committee, and the Region Chairs.  She works with each committee to ensure that they are accomplishing their various tasks.  With the new action plan in place, the committees and the Region Chairs have their work cut out for them.<P>
<B>Cheryl Turner</B> is the Vice President of Programs. She is in charge of planning the student segment of CEC's annual convention happening in Orlando, FL on April 1-5, 1996.  Besides working to secure presenters for various student sessions, Cheryl plans the Welcome to Orlando Icebreaker, the Student CEC dance, and all the other convention activities.  In the meantime, she is getting her degree in special education at Harris Stowe State College in St. Louis, MO.  <P>
The Vice President of Communications, <B>Kimberly Garvis</B>,  is an undergraduate student at Providence College in Rhode Island.  Kimberly is responsible for a myriad of activities: she takes minutes; chairs the Publications Committee; writes and edits articles for <I>CEC Today</I>; and promotes Student CEC activities in CEC publications.  Send your news to Kim.<P>
<B>Allan Balitian</B>, is serving as the Canadian Student Liaison.  This is the first time the CSL has  been a member of the Student CEC Executive Committee and we are excited to welcome him on board.  He will be communicating with chapters and associations in Canada and working with the Student CEC Executive Committee to strengthen Student CEC and Canadian CEC relationships.  Allan is working towards his ministry certification at the University of  Toronto.<P>
<B>The Election of the Student CEC Executive Committee</B><BR>
<BR>
The officers are elected each year at CEC's annual convention and serve a 1 year term.<BR>
<B><BR>

STUDENT CEC COMMITTEES 
<P>
The Definition, Role, and Make-up of Student CEC Committees<BR>
<BR>
</B>Committees play a very important role in Student CEC.  Their duties include finding more effective ways to recruit and retain members, selecting Student CEC award winners, promoting ethnic and multicultural concerns, and writing articles for Student CEC publications.<P>
There are two different types of committees managed by Student CEC.  They are standing committees and ad hoc committees.  Standing committees are permanent committees which report to the Student CEC Executive Committee and the Student CEC Board of Governors annually.  Ad hoc committees are set up at the discretion of the Student CEC Executive Committee or the Student CEC Board of Governors to investigate and study specific situations or subjects.  Once an ad hoc committee completes its task and reports its findings, it is dissolved.<P>
Student members are encouraged to get involved with a committee.  Contact Samantha Sexton, VP of  Committees, or the committee chair if you are interested in working on a committee.<BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Honors Committee<BR>
<BR>
</B>The main goal of this committee is to solicit nominations from the field for the Outstanding Student CEC Member of the Year Award and the Student CEC Graduation Award.  Both  graduate and undergraduate Student CEC members are chosen for each award.   Reading all the nominations and selecting the winners are the largest responsibilities.  This year the committee will also create a presentation on CEC's standards of practice.<P>
Kathie Good (NM) is the chair of the Student CEC Honors Committee and the committee members are Florence Bissola (ON), Todd Catanzano (VT), Kathleen Cutler (NY), Lori Lange (MN), Meredith Lintner (KY), and Jennifer Simpson (NC).<BR>
 <B><BR>
Student CEC Membership Committee<P>
</B>The Membership Committee promotes recruitment and retention efforts, oversees the Annual Association Membership Contest, and provides support for the membership months and  membership awards.  This year the committee will promote the Each One Reach One campaign  for use during the October membership month.  They will also research the use of electronic communication as a means of promoting Student CEC.<P>
The Student CEC Membership Committee chair is Amy Ansley (FL), and the members are Darrell Dean (LA), Karen Leroux (ON), Connie Pickett (MS), and Heather Swain (NC).<BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Ethnic and Multicultural Concerns Committee<P>
</B>This committee was created to serve as a resource to Student CEC chapters and associations with activities that promote an awareness of ethnic and multicultural concerns.  The chair of this committee helps select the Student CEC/FEC Ethnic Diversity Scholarship recipient as well.  The committee will also create a handbook for Multicultural and Ethnic Diversity Month.<P>
Mary Ann Pearson (NM) is the chair of the Student CEC Ethnic and Multicultural Concerns Committee, and the members of the committee are Jennifer Faukner (CA), Brenda Lopez Rodriguez (PR), Henry Marcet (FL), and Tinhai Vong (MB).<BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Publications Committee<P>
</B>Members of this committee will work closely with Kimberly Garvis, the Vice President of Communications, to develop articles for the Student CEC pages in <I>CEC Today</I>, and compile ideas for the<I> Student CEC Activity Idea Book</I>.  <P>
The chair is Kimberly Garvis (RI) and the committee members are Allan Balitian (ON), Judy Barry (RI), Sandie Benz (NY), Todd Catanzano (VT), Margaret Heskett (ME), Mark David Hurte (KY), Elaine Hutcheson (VA), Michelle Klei (FL), Vivian Lasley (KY), Idalis Negr&oacute;n (PR), Karen Nespoli (NY), Diane Noon (CA), and Mariela Ramos (PR).<B><P>
Student CEC Action Plan Ad Hoc Committee<P>
</B>To establish an effective action plan for the next three years, the 1995 Student CEC Board of Governors created an ad hoc committee to research, write, and present a Student CEC action plan  from 1996-1999 to both Student CEC and CEC governors.  The action plan will move Student CEC towards the 21st century and ensure that Student CEC works collaboratively with CEC.<P>
Mark Kandel (DLD) is the chair of the Student CEC Action Plan Ad Hoc Committee, and the members are Adrienne Blumenthal (NS), Tina Hoopingarner (MRDD), DeAnn Lechtenberger (TX), Heather Tindall (MT), and Cheri Weyrich (NM). <BR>
<B><BR>
Student CEC Transition Ad Hoc Committee<BR>
</B><BR>
Student CEC members eventually make the transition from student to professional membership, but during that first year out in the "real world" CEC membership dues aren't often a priority.  The Student CEC Board of Governors created a 3 year ad hoc committee to establish a transition plan and to  a mentoring program for Student CEC and CEC members.  The committee is made up of professional and student members committed to developing effective transition programs.<P>
The chair of the Student CEC Transition Ad Hoc Committee is Heather McCartt (IN) and the committee members are Jerry Ammer (CA), Heather Baumann (IL), Sheri&eacute; Campbell (FL), Phyllis Froese (MB), and Mayra Gonz&aacute;lez Garcia (PR).<B><BR>

<B>Yes I' m Interested -- What is the Election Process?<BR>
</B><BR>
<ol>
<li>     Obtain a petition packet from the Coordinator of Student Activities -- Call 800/845-6232.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     Send your petition packet, postmarked <B> by February 16,</B> to CEC Headquarters and make plans to attend the annual CEC convention.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     The following two phase screening process will be used in the event that more than 6 candidates petition for one office:  <BR><ol type=a>
<li>     Each governor receives a packet containing the petition of each prospective candidate to share with students within the governor's state or province.<BR>
<li>     Governors rank-order the petitions and return them to CEC Headquarters.  <BR>
<li>     The field of petitioners is reduced to a maximum of 6 candidates and 1 alternate for each office.  An alternate becomes a candidate only if a candidate officially withdraws from the ballot before the formal interview of candidates for that office.  <BR>
<li>     This screening does not occur if 6 or less candidates petition for the same office.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<li>     Once the petition is received, a letter of recommendation from an academic or Student CEC faculty advisor is requested and held confidential.  It is added to the respective candidate's packet to be studied by the Student Board of Governors at the annual meeting.  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     One or two days prior to the official start of the convention, candidates meet with the Student CEC Executive Committee to answer last-minute questions.  Candidates then visit with the governors and other students on an informal basis at the Meet and Greet the Candidates Icebreaker.  Each candidate will have the opportunity to express his or her reasons for seeking office. <BR>
<BR>
<li>     During the Student CEC Board of Governors' meeting, a formal interview of the candidates is conducted by the Student CEC Board of Governors.  The candidate must:<BR><ol type=a>
<li>     be prepared to give a 5 minute speech which could include personal information, reasons for wanting to hold an office, and intended objectives while in office.<BR>
<li>     be prepared to answer questions posed by governors following the 5 minute speech.<BR></ol>
The question period lasts about 15 minutes and consists of some pre-prepared questions..  <BR>
<BR>
<li>     The governors then review each candidate individually.  The candidates are not present at this meeting.  The procedure followed for review of candidates is:<BR><ol type=a>
<li>     One round of positive comments by the governors for each candidate for each office.<BR>
<li>     One round of negative comments by the governors for each candidate for each office.<BR>
<li>     Discussion of all candidates for each office.<BR>
<li>     Voting by secret ballot for each office (each governor and executive committee member has one vote).<BR>
<li>     If no candidate for a particular office is elected by majority vote after 3 ballots, the election process is passed to the Student CEC Steering Committee.<BR>
<li>     The Student CEC Steering Committee caucuses with the governors in each region and compiles a list of potential candidates for the office.<BR>
<li>     The Student CEC Steering Committee discusses and ranks the list of candidates.  This is also done in the event that no petitions are received for a particular office.  The 3 candidates receiving the highest ranking for each vacant office are interviewed during a joint meeting of the Student CEC Steering and Executive Committees.<BR>
<li>     After considering all of the candidates, the Student CEC Steering and Executive Committees vote for an individual to fill the office.  Simple majority vote rules.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<li>     Each officer meets individually with the candidates(s) for his/her office to inform them of the election results after the vote has taken place, or the candidates are notified by phone.<BR>
<BR>
<li>     If elected, it is recommended that the candidate attend the convention from the beginning of the election process (informal interviews) through the final day of convention.  Many activities will take place which require the attendance of the newly elected officers.<BR></ol>
<BR>
<B>Campaigning</B><P>
Due to the nature of the election process, and because of the inappropriateness of normal "campaign procedures," buttons, posters, and other campaign items will not be allowed at the convention.  Correspondence with any or all of the Student CEC governors is allowed prior to arrival at the convention.<P>
<BR>

<B>THE STUDENT CEC ELECTION CHECKLIST</B>  
<P>
Members of the Student CEC Board of Governors should take their role in the student election very seriously.  They must understand the importance of their judgement criteria, as well as remember that during the formal interviews, their role is to LISTEN rather than talk.  Also, it is crucial that each governor listen critically but evaluate every candidate in a positive manner.<P>
This checklist was created to aid governors in assessing the qualifications of candidates as well as help candidates evaluate their qualifications.   Use it to formulate observations and questions.<P>

<B>WHAT'S WHAT AT THE CONVENTION!</B> 
<P>
What happens that's special for students at the annual CEC Convention? Here is a quick summary of some of the meetings and social events planned for Student CEC members.  <P>
<B>The Student Spot</B><P>
This ideal student gathering place is traditionally located in the convention center. Information about student happenings, inexpensive restaurants, and places to explore in the convention city are available at the Student Spot.  <BR>
<B><BR>
The Personnel Recruitment Center</B><P>
Looking for a job?  Want to brush up on your interview skills?  Come to the Personnel Recruitment Center located in the convention center.  Various school districts will be on hand, so plan to bring copies of  your resume and a good interview suit.<BR>
<B><BR>
Meet and Greet:  Candidate and Governor Icebreaker</B><P>
Early in the convention week, Student CEC governors, candidates petitioning for the Student CEC Executive Committee, and any other interested Student CEC members should plan to get together for an icebreaker.  Governors will have the opportunity to meet their fellow board members, greet the candidates, and get to know each other in a fun, enjoyable atmosphere.  We hope you will be able to make it.<P>
<B>The Student CEC Board of Governors' Meeting<BR>
</B><BR>
The Student CEC Board of Governors meets early in the convention week (contact CEC Headquarters for dates). The election of the Student CEC Executive Committee occurs at this time.  Other issues of current interest are addressed at this time.  All students are welcome to observe the meeting.<P>
The purpose of the Student CEC  Board of Governors' meeting is to set policy for Student CEC, to share information, and to elect the Student CEC Executive Committee.  A certified student representative from every state or province with an organized association should plan to attend.    If a governor is unable to attend, an alternate can be designated to attend in the governor's place.  Division governors should plan to attend as well, as they are an official part of the Student CEC.<P>
 
<B> 
The Student CEC "Welcome to the Convention City" Icebreaker </B><P>
The Student Icebreaker is an excellent activity to meet your fellow Student CEC members!   Be ready to play some games, swap a T-shirt with someone you don't know, and display your chapter and association wares.  DON'T FORGET YOUR T-SHIRT.<P>
<B>The Student CEC Awards' Ceremony </B><BR>
<BR>
Each year Student CEC recognizes the award winners for the Outstanding Student CEC Member Award, the Susan Phillips Gorin Award, the Shana Breen Memorial Award, the Graduation Award, the Ethnic Diversity Scholarship Award, and the Region of the Year Award.<P>
<B>The Student CEC Dance <BR>
</B><BR>
The traditional Student CEC Dance generally costs $5.00, with proceeds going towards the Student CEC/FEC Ethnic Diversity Scholarship and the membership development of Student CEC chapters and associations.<P>
<B>The Student CEC Sessions<BR>
</B><BR>
A number of sessions are conducted that focus specifically on students.  These have been chosen by the Program Advisory Committee with the intention of meeting the needs of preprofessionals.  Watch for these sessions!                                  <P>
<B>The Student CEC Potpourri Session<BR>
</B><BR>
Getting out in the real world that first year is both an exciting and terrifying thought. The Student CEC Potpourri session focuses on that first year experience and all that you need to know in order to get your first job.  At this session you will learn techniques for getting a job and making it through your first year.<P>
