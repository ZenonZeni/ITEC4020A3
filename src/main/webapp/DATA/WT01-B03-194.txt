         strategy is to identify, acquire and develop pharmaceutical
         products in the later stages of development in order to
         shorten the research and development cycle and thereby
         minimize the time and expense associated with drug
         development. The Company believes that this approach differs
         from that adopted by most pharmaceutical companies. </FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Instead of engaging in pure discovery
         research to obtain lead compounds, the Company licenses or
         acquires rights to compounds typically at the preclinical or
         early clinical stage of development that have shown efficacy
         in humans or in a model relevant to a particular clinical
         disease. The Company then seeks to enhance and complete the
         product development and bring the product to market. </FONT>
         
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>In its generic and supergeneric drug
         development program, the Company targets off-patent products
         that have already been commercialized but nevertheless offer
         the Company attractive market opportunities. The Company
         believes that this approach minimizes the significant
         financial investment required by pure discovery research and
         reduces the risk of failure in developing a commercially
         viable product. </FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>SuperGen's objective is to become a leading
         supplier of pharmaceuticals for life-threatening diseases,
         including cancer and blood cell disorders, and other serious
         conditions such as obesity. The Company focuses its product
         development efforts where the Company believes there are
         significant market opportunities, such as in the treatment
         of cancer and other blood cell disorders and in obesity, as
         well as in smaller niche markets where the Company believes
         there is limited competition, such as certain anticancer
         drug markets.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>The Company seeks to develop a diversified
         pharmaceutical offering within its focused anticancer/blood
         cell disorder market, including generic, supergeneric and
         proprietary drugs, and seeks to implement a staged strategy
         for bringing products to market. The Company believes that
         early commercialization of its anticancer generic drugs will
         assist the Company in developing its reputation and presence
         in the market while it continues to develop its supergeneric
         and proprietary products. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
