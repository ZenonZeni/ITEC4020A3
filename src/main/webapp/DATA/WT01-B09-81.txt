<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>The Center for Electromechanics at the University of Texas (UT­CEM) has an ongoing program to
develop vehicle active electromechanical suspension (EMS) systems. The program began with funding
from the National Automotive Center at the U. S. Army Tank and Automotive Command to perform a
full­scale, proof­of­principle demonstration of an EMS system for an M1 tank. The demonstration
consisted of a single wheel station (equivalent to quarter car model for a convential four wheeled
vehicle), with the vehicle mass simulated by a 5 ton concrete block (the weight supported by one M1
roadwheel station). Vertical terrain displacements were simulated with a hydraulic ram. in the course
of the project, UT­CEM developed a new approach to active suspension control, referred to as a Near
Constant Force Suspension, that allows simplified control strategies; does not require advanced terrain
knowledge (look­ahead); and has demonstrated four­fold cross country speed increases with
simultaneous six­fold reductions in sprung mass accelerations (compared to existing M1
performance)) over very rough off­road terrain. Performance plots for the existing M1 tank wheel station
with passive suspension components (shown on left) and EMS active suspension (right) are compared
below for severe 500 foot terrain input track.</P>

<P>In our current follow­on project, funded by ARPA, UT­CEM is adapting the concept from M1 tank
trailing arm configuration to dual A­arm configurations, as is found in commercial and military wheeled
vehicles Control strategies are being expanded to a four wheel laboratory test platform.. Experimental
results are showing similar performance benefits to the single wheel test rig The final (future) phase of
the military program would apply the results of the first two projects to a military off­road vehicle, such
as the HMMWV UT­CEM has been selected for a joint TACOM­ARPA project to develop advanced
linear actuators that will be required for this application.</P>

<P>In a related effort, Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority (HMTA) has indicated a desire to apply the
EMS concepts to a transit bus, under the auspices of their "Next Generation Bus!' program Lotus
Engineering, with their successful experience in active suspension systems for on­road, wheeled
vehicles, is a major sub­contractor in the HMTA effort This effort is schedule to start on April 1,1996. </P>
