On the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

</center>
<p>
The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union,<p>
<p>
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in
particular Article 100a thereof,<p>
<p>
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (<a href="Final_EC_Directive95_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>),<p>
<p>
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (<a
href="Final_EC_Directive95_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>),<p>
<p>
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b of the
Treaty (<a href="Final_EC_Directive95_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a>),<p>
<p>
Whereas the objectives of the Community, as laid down in the Treaty, as amended
by the Treaty on European Union, include establishing an ever closer union
among the people of Europe, fostering closer relations between the States
belonging to the Community, ensuring economic and social progress by common
action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe, encouraging the constant
improvement of the living conditions of its people, preserving and
strengthening peace and liberty and promoting democracy on the basis of the
fundamental rights recognized in the constitutions and laws of the Member
States and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms;<p>
<p>
Whereas data-processing systems are designed to serve man; whereas they must,
whatever the nationality or residence of natural persons, respect the
fundamental freedoms and rights of individuals, notably the right to privacy,
and contribute to economic and social progress, trade expansion and the
well-being of individuals;<p>
<p>
Whereas the establishment and functioning of an internal market in which, in
accordance with Article 7a of the Treaty, the free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital is ensured require not only that personal data should be
able to flow freely from one Member State to another, but also that the
fundamental rights of individuals should be safeguarded.<p>
<p>
Whereas increasingly frequent recourse is being had in the Community to the
processing of personal data in the various spheres of economic and social
activity; whereas the progress made in information technology is making the
processing and exchange of such data considerably easier;<p>
<p>
Whereas the economic and social integration resulting from the establishment
and functioning of the internal market within the meaning of Article 7a of the
Treaty will necessarily lead to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of
personal data between all those involved in a private or public capacity in
economic and social activity in the Member States; whereas the exchange of
personal data between undertakings in different Member States is set to
increase; whereas the national authorities in the various Member States are
being called upon by virtue of Community law to collaborate and exchange
personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on
behalf of an authority in another Member State within the context of the area
without internal frontiers as constituted by the Internal Market;<p>
<p>
Whereas, furthermore, the increase in scientific and technical cooperation and
the coordinated introduction of new telecommunications networks in the
Community necessitate and facilitate cross-border flows of personal data;<p>
<p>
Whereas the difference in levels of protection of the rights and freedoms of
individuals, notably the right to privacy, with regard to the processing of
personal data afforded in the Member States may prevent the transmission of
such data from the territory of one Member State to that of another Member
State; whereas this difference may therefore constitute an obstacle to the
pursuit of a number of economic activities at Community level, distort
competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities
under Community law; whereas this difference in levels of protection is due to
the existence of a wide variety of national laws, regulations and
administrative provisions;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data, the level
of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the
processing of such data must be equivalent in all the Member States; whereas
this objective is vital to the internal market but cannot be achieved by Member
States alone, especially in view of the scale of the divergences which
currently exist between the relevant laws in the Member States and the need to
coordinate the laws of the Member States so as to ensure that the cross-border
flow of personal data is regulated in a consistent manner that is in keeping
with the objective of the internal market as provided for in Article 7a of the
Treaty; whereas Community action to approximate those laws is therefore needed;
<p>
<p>
Whereas, given the equivalent protection resulting from the approximation of
national laws, the Member States will no longer be able to inhibit the free
movement between them of personal data on grounds relating to protection of the
rights and freedoms of individuals, and in particular the right to privacy;
whereas Member States will be left a margin for manoeuvre, which may, in the
context of implementation of the Directive, also be exercised by the business
and social partners; whereas Member States will therefore be able to specify in
their national law the general conditions governing the lawfulness of data
processing; whereas in doing so the Member States shall strive to improve the
protection currently provided by their legislation; whereas, within the limits
of this margin for manoeuvre and in accordance with Community law, disparities
could arise in the implementation of the Directive, and this could have an
effect on the movement of data within a Member State as well as within the
Community;<p>
<p>
Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is
to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which
is recognized both in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of
Community law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must
not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the
contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles of the protection of the rights and freedoms of
individuals, notably the right to privacy, which are contained in this
Directive, give substance to and amplify those contained in the Council of
Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with
regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data;<p>
<p>
Whereas the protection principles must apply to all processing of personal data
by any person whose activities are governed by Community law; whereas there
should be excluded the processing of data carried out by a natural person in
the exercise of activities which are exclusively personal or domestic, such as
correspondence and the holding of records of addresses;<p>
<p>
Whereas the activities referred to in Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European
Union regarding public safety, defence, State security or the activities of the
State in the area of criminal law fall outside the scope of Community law,
without prejudice to the obligations incumbent upon Member States under Article
56(2), Article 57 or Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the European
Community; whereas the processing of personal data that is necessary to
safeguard the economic well-being of the State does not fall within the scope
of this Directive where such processing relates to State security matters;<p>
<p>
Whereas, given the importance of the developments under way, in the framework
of the information society, of the techniques used to capture, transmit,
manipulate, record, store or communicate sound and image data relating to
natural persons, this Directive should be applicable to processing involving
such data;<p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of such data is covered by this Directive only if it is
automated or if the data processed are contained or are intended to be
contained in a filing system structured according to specific criteria relating
to individuals, so as to permit easy access to the personal data in question;<p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of sound and image data, such as in cases of video
surveillance, does not come within the scope of this Directive if it is carried
out for the purposes of public security, defence, national security or in the
course of State activities relating to the area of criminal law or of other
activities which do not come within the scope of Community law;<p>
<p>
Whereas as far as the processing of sound and image data carried out for
purposes of journalism or the purposes of literary or artistic expression is
concerned, in particular in the audiovisual field, the principles of the
Directive are to apply in a restricted manner according to the provisions laid
down in Article 9,<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection
to which they are entitled under this Directive, any processing of personal
data in the Community must be carried out in accordance with the law of one of
the Member States; whereas, in this connection, processing carried out under
the responsibility of a controller who is established in a Member State should
be governed by the law of that State;<p>
<p>
Whereas establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective
and real exercise of activity through the means of a stable set-up; whereas the
legal form of such an establishment, whether a simple branch or a subsidiary
with a legal personality, is not the determinate factor in this respect;
whereas, when a single controller is established on the territory of several
Member States, particularly be means of a subsidiary, he must ensure, in order
to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each of the establishments
fulfils the obligations imposed by the national law applicable to its
activities;<p>
<p>
Whereas the fact that processing is carried out by a person established in a
third country must not stand in the way of the protection of individuals
provided for in this Directive; whereas, in these cases, the processing should
be governed by the law of the Member State in which the means used are located,
and there should be guarantees to ensure that the rights and obligations
provided for in this Directive are respected in practice;<p>
<p>
Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the rules of territoriality
applicable in criminal matters;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States shall more precisely define in the laws they enact or
when bringing into force the measures taken under this Directive, the general
circumstances in which processing is lawful; whereas in particular Article 5,
in conjunction with Articles 7 and 8, allows Member States, independently of
general rules, to provide for special processing conditions for specific
sectors and for the various categories of data covered by Article 8;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States are empowered to ensure the implementation of the
protection of individuals both by means of a general law on the protection of
individuals against the processing of personal data and by sectorial laws such
as those relating, for example, to Institutes for Statistics;<p>
<p>
Whereas the legislation concerning the protection of legal persons with regard
to the processing of data which concern them is not affected by this
Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one hand, in the
obligations imposed on persons, public authorities, enterprises, agencies or
other bodies responsible for processing, in particular regarding data quality,
technical security, notification to the supervisory authority, and the
circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other
hand, in the rights conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject
of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the
data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain
circumstances;<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles of protection must apply to any information concerning
an identified or identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether a person is
identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be
used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said
person; whereas the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered
anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable;
whereas codes of conduct within the meaning of Article 27 may be a useful
instrument in providing guidance as to the way in which data may be rendered
anonymous and retained in a form in which identification of the data subject is
no longer possible; <p>
<p>
Whereas the protection of individuals must apply as much to automatic
processing of data as to manual processing; whereas the scope of this
protection must not in effect depend on the techniques used, otherwise this
would create a serious risk of circumvention; whereas, nonetheless, as regards
manual processing, this Directive covers only filing systems, not according to
specific criteria relating to individuals allowing easy access to the personal
data; whereas, in line with the definition in Article 2(c) the different
criteria for determining the constituents of a structured set of personal data,
and the different criteria governing access to such a set, can be laid down by
each Member State; whereas files or sets of files as well as their cover pages,
which are not structured according to specific criteria, shall under no
circumstances fall within the scope of this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair to the
individual concerned; whereas, in particular, the data must be adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed; whereas such purposes must be explicit and legitimate and must be
determined at the time of collection of the data; whereas the purposes of
processing further to collection shall not be incompatible with the purposes as
they were originally specified;<p>
<p>
Whereas the further processing of personal data for historical, statistical, or
scientific purposes is not generally to be considered incompatible with the
purposes for which the data have previously been collected provided that Member
States furnish suitable guarantees; whereas these guarantees must in particular
rule out the use of data for taking measures or decisions regarding any
particular individual;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to be lawful, the processing of personal data must in
addition be carried out with the consent of the data subject or be necessary
with a view to the conclusion or performance of a contract binding on the data
subject, or be required by law, by the performance of a task in the public
interest or in the exercise of official authority, or by the interest of a
natural or legal person provided that the interests or the rights and freedoms
of the data subject are not overriding; whereas, in particular, in order to
maintain a balance between the interests involved while guaranteeing effective
competition, Member States remain free to determine the circumstances in which
personal data may be used or disclosed to a third party in the context of the
legitimate ordinary business activities of companies and other bodies; whereas
Member States may similarly specify the conditions under which personal data
may be disclosed to a third party for the purposes of marketing whether carried
out commercially or b a charitable organization or by any other association or
foundation, of a political nature for example, subject to the provisions
allowing a data subject to object to the processing of data regarding him, at
no cost and without having to state his reasons;<p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of personal data must equally be regarded as lawful
where it is carried out in order to protect an interest which is essential for
the data subject's life;<p>
<p>
Whereas it is for national legislation to determine whether the controller
performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority should be a public administration or another national or
legal person governed by public law or by private law or such as a professional
association;<p>
<p>
Whereas data which are capable by their nature of infringing fundamental
freedoms or privacy should not be processed unless the data subject gives his
explicit consent; whereas, however, derogation from this prohibition must be
explicitly provided for in respect of specific needs, in particular where the
processing of these data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by
individuals subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy or in the
course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the
purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States must Also be authorized, when justified by grounds of
important public interest, to derogate from the prohibition on processing
sensitive categories of data where important reasons of public interest so
justify in areas such as public health and social protection, especially as
regards the assurance of quality and cost-effectiveness, and as regards the
procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health
insurance system, scientific research and government statistics; whereas it is
incumbent on them, however, to provide specific and suitable safeguards so as
to protect the fundamental rights and the privacy of individuals;<p>
<p>
Whereas, moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for
achieving aims, laid down in constitutional law or international public law, of
officially recognized religious associations is carried out on important
grounds of public interest;<p>
<p>
Whereas where, in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the
democratic system requires in certain Member States that political parties
compile data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data can be
permitted for reasons of important public interest, provided that appropriate
safeguards are established; <p>
<p>
Whereas the processing of personal data for purposes of journalism or for
purposes of literary or artistic expression, in particular in the audiovisual
field, should qualify for exemption from the requirements of certain provisions
of this Directive insofar as this is necessary to reconcile the fundamental
rights of individuals with freedom of information and notably the right to
receive and impart information, as guaranteed in particular in Article 10 of
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms; whereas Member States should therefore lay down exemptions and
derogations necessary for the purposes of balance between fundamental rights as
regards general measures on the legitimacy of data processing, measures on the
transfer of data to third countries and the powers of supervisory authority;
whereas this should not, however, lead Member States to lay down exemptions
from the measures to ensure security of processing; whereas the supervisory
authority responsible for this sector should also be provided at least with
certain ex-post powers, e.g. to publish a regular report or to refer matters to
the judicial authorities; <p>
<p>
Whereas, if the processing of data is to be fair, the data subject must be in a
position to learn of the existence of a processing operation and, where data
are collected from him, must be given accurate and full information, bearing in
mind the circumstances of the collection;<p>
<p>
Whereas certain processing operations involve data which the controller has not
collected directly from the data subject; whereas, furthermore, data can be
legitimately disclosed to a third party, even if the disclosure was not
anticipated at the time the data were collected from the data subject; whereas,
in all these cases, the data subject should be informed when the data are
recorded  or at the latest when the data are first disclosed to a third
party;<p>
<p>
Whereas, however, it is not necessary to impose this obligation if the data
subject already knows the information; whereas, moreover, this obligation is
not provided for if the recording or disclosure are expressly provided for by
law or if the provision of information proves impossible or involved
disproportionate efforts, which could be the case where processing is for
historical, statistical or scientific purposes; whereas, in this regard, the
number of data subjects, the age of the data, and any compensatory measures
adopted may be taken into consideration;<p>
<p>
Whereas any person must be able to exercise the right of access to data
relating to him which are being processed, in order to verify in particular the
accuracy of the data and the lawfulness of the processing; whereas, for the
same reasons, every data subject must also have the right to know the logic
involved in the automatic processing of data concerning him, at least in the
case of the automated decisions referred to in Article 15(1); whereas this
right must not be adversely affect business confidentiality or intellectual
property and in particular the copyright protecting the software; whereas these
considerations must not, however, result in the data subject being refused all
information;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States may, in the interest of the data subject or so as to
protect the rights and freedoms of others, restrict rights of access and
information; whereas they may, for example, specify that access to medical data
may be obtained only through a health professional;<p>
<p>
Whereas restrictions on the rights of access and information and on certain
obligations of the controller may similarly be imposed by Member States insofar
as they are necessary to safeguard, for example, national security, defence,
public safety, or important economic or financial interests of a Member State
or the Union, as well as criminal investigations and prosecutions and action in
respect of breaches of ethics in the regulated professions; whereas the list of
exceptions and limitations should include the tasks of monitoring, inspection
or regulation necessary in three last-mentioned areas concerning public
security, economic or financial interests and crime prevention; whereas the
listing of tasks in these three areas does not affect the legitimacy of
exceptions or restrictions for reasons of State security or defence;<p>
Whereas Member States may also be led, by virtue of the provisions of Community
law, to derogate from the provisions of this Directive concerning the right of
access, the obligation to inform individuals and the quality of data, in order
to safeguard certain purposes among those referred to above;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in cases of processing lawfully data pursued on grounds of public
interest, official authority or the legitimate interests of a natural or legal
person, any data subject should nevertheless be entitled, on legitimate and
compelling grounds relating to his particular situation, to object to the
processing of any data relating to himself; whereas Member States nevertheless
have the possibility of laying down national provisions to the contrary;<p>
<p>
Whereas the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects with regard
to the processing of personal data requires that appropriate technical and
organizational measures be taken, both at the time of the design of the
processing system and at the time of the processing itself, particularly in
order to maintain security and thereby to prevent any unauthorized processing;
whereas it is incumbent on the Member States to ensure that controllers comply
with these measures; whereas these measures must ensure an appropriate level of
security, taking into account the state of the technology and the cost of its
use in view of the risks inherent in the processing and the nature of the data
to be protected;<p>
<p>
Whereas where a message containing personal data is transmitted by means of a
telecommunications or electronic mail service, the sole purpose of which is the
transmission of such messages, the controller in respect of the personal data
contained in the message will normally be considered to be the person from whom
the message originates, rather than the person offering the transmission
services; whereas, nevertheless, those offering such services will normally be
considered controllers in respect of the processing of the additional personal
data necessary for the operation of the service;<p>
<p>
Whereas the notification procedures are designed to ensure disclosure of the
purposes and main features of any processing operation for the purpose of
verification that the operation is in accordance with the national measures
taken under this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in order to avoid unsuitable administrative formalities, exemptions
from the obligation to notify and simplification of the notification required
may be provided for by Member States in cases where processing is unlikely to
adversely affect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, provided that it is
in accordance with a measure taken by a Member State specifying its limits;
whereas in an equivalent way exemption or simplification can similarly be
provided for by Member States where a person appointed by the controller
ensures that the processing carried out is not likely adversely to affect the
rights and freedoms of data subjects; whereas such an official, whether or not
an employee of the controller, must be in a position to exercise his functions
in complete independence;<p>
<p>
Whereas exemption or simplification could be provided for in cases of
processing operations whose sole purpose is the keeping of a register intended,
according to national law, to provide information to the public and open to
consultation by the public or by any person demonstrating a legitimate
interest;<p>
<p>
Whereas, nevertheless, simplification or exemption from the obligation to
notify shall not release the controller from any of the other obligations
resulting from this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in this context, ex post facto verification by the competent
authorities must be in general be considered a sufficient measure;<p>
<p>
Whereas, however, certain processing operations are likely to pose specific
risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects by virtue of their nature,
their scope or their purposes, such as the purpose of excluding individuals
from a right, benefit or contract, or by virtue of the specific use of new
technologies; whereas it is for Member States, if they so wish, to specify such
risks in their legislation;<p>
<p>
Whereas with regard to all the processing undertaken in society, the amount
posing such specific risks should be very limited; whereas Member States must
provide that the supervisory authority, or the data protection official in
cooperation with the authority, check such processing prior to it being carried
out; whereas following this prior check, the supervisory authority may,
according to its national law, give an opinion or an authorization regarding
the processing; whereas such checking may equally take place in the course of
the preparation of a legislative measure adopted by the national parliament or
on the basis of such a measure, defining the nature of the processing and
specifying suitable safeguards;<p>
<p>
Whereas, if the controller fails to respect the rights of data subjects,
national legislation must provide for a judicial remedy; whereas any damage
which a person may suffer as a result of unlawful processing must be
compensated for by the controller, who may be exempted from liability if he
proves that he is not responsible for the damage, in particular in cases where
he reports an error on the part of the data subject or in a case of force
majeure; whereas sanctions must be imposed on any person, whether governed by
private or public law, who fails to comply with the national measures taken
under this Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas cross-border flows of personal data are necessary to the expansion of
international trade; whereas the protection of individuals guaranteed in the
Community by this Directive does not stand in the way of transfers of personal
data to third countries which ensure an adequate level of protection; whereas
the adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country must be
assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding the transfer
operation or set of transfer operations;<p>
<p>
Whereas, on the other hand, the transfer of personal data to a third country
which does not ensure an adequate level of protection must be prohibited;<p>
<p>
Whereas provision should be made for exemptions from this prohibition in
certain circumstances where the data subject has given his consent, where the
transfer is necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, where
protection of an important public interest so requires, for example in cases of
international transfers of data between tax or customs administrations or
between services competent for social security matters, or where the transfer
is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the
public or persons having a legitimate interest; whereas in this case such a
transfer should not involve the entirety of the data or entire categories of
the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for
consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be
made only at the request of the same persons or if the latter are the
recipients;<p>
<p>
Whereas particular measures may be taken to compensate for the lack of
protection in a third country in cases where the person responsible for the
processing offers appropriate assurances; whereas, moreover, provision must be
made for procedures for negotiations between the Community and such third
countries;<p>
<p>
Whereas, in any event, transfers to third countries may only be effected in
full compliance with the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to
this Directive, and in particular Article 8 thereof;<p>
<p>
Whereas Member States and the Commission, in their respective spheres of
competence, must encourage the trade associations and other representative
organizations concerned to draw up codes of conduct so far as to facilitate the
application of this Directive, taking account of the specific characteristics
of the processing carried out in certain sectors, and respecting the national
provisions adopted for its implementation;<p>
<p>
Whereas the establishment in Member States of supervisory authorities,
exercising their functions with complete independence, is an essential
component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data;<p>
<p>
Whereas such authorities must have the necessary means to perform their duties,
including powers of investigation and intervention, particularly in cases of
complaints from individuals, and powers to engage in legal proceedings; whereas
such authorities must help to ensure transparency of processing in the Member
States within those jurisdiction they fall;<p>
<p>
Whereas the authorities in the different Member States will need to assist one
another in performing their duties so as to ensure that the rules of protection
are properly respected throughout the European Union;<p>
<p>
Whereas, at Community level, a Working Party on the Protection of Individuals
with regard to the Processing of Personal Data must be set up and be completely
independent in the performance of its functions; whereas, having regard to its
specific nature, it must advise the Commission and, in particular, contribute
to the uniform application of the national rules adopted pursuant to this
Directive;<p>
<p>
Whereas, with regard to the transfer of data to third countries, the
application of this Directive calls for the conferment of powers of
implementation on the Commission and the establishment of a procedure in
accordance with the procedures laid down in Council Decision 87/373/EEC(1)<p>
<p>
Whereas the principles set out in this Directive regarding the protection of
the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably their right to privacy, with
regard to the processing of personal data may be supplemented or clarified, in
particular as far as certain sectors are concerned, by specific rules based on
those principles; <p>
<p>
Whereas Member States should be allowed a period of not more than three years
from the entry into force of the national measures transposing this Directive
in which to apply such new national rules gradually to all processing
operations already under way; whereas, in order to facilitate cost-efficient
implementation, a further period expiring twelve years after the date on which
this Directive is adopted will be allowed to Member States to ensure the
conformity of existing manual filing systems with certain of the Directive's
provisions; whereas data contained in such filing systems actively processed
during this extended transition period should nevertheless be brought into
conformity with these provisions at the time of such further active processing;
Whereas an agreement on a "modus vivendi" between the European Parliament, the
Council and the Commission concerning the implimenting measures for acts
adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the EC
Treaty was reached on 20 December 1994,<p>
<p>
Whereas it is not necessary for the data subject to give his consent again so
as to allow the controller to continue to process, after the national
provisions taken pursuant to this Directive enter into force, any sensitive
data necessary for the performance of a contract concluded on the basis of free
and informed consent before the entry into force of these provisions;<p>
<p>
Whereas this Directive does not stand in the way of a Member State's regulating
marketing activities aimed at consumers residing in its territory insofar as
much as such regulation does not concern the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data;<p>
<p>
Whereas the Directive allows the principle of public access to official
documents to be taken into account when implementing the principles set out in
this Directive,<p>
<p>
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:<p>
<p>
<b>CHAPTER 1</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>GENERAL PROVISIONS</b><p>
<p>
<b>Article 1</b><p>
<p>
<b>Object of the Directive</b><p>
<p>
1. In accordance with this Directive, Member States shall protect the
fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their
right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data.<p>
