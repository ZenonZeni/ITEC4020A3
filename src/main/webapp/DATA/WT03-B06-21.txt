The Anglo-Saxon model for Russia

Foreign direct investment is increasingly taking over from bank 
leverage, as in Germany, or state  influence, as in France and Japan, 
as the desirable means to overhaul an ailing economy or industrial 
sector.  Industries losing out in world competition, such as the UK 
and US car sectors fifteen years ago, are either taken over entirely, 
as in the UK, or respond to the prospect by  restructuring 
themselves, as in the US.  Either way a country finds itself with a 
new modern industry.
The US and the UK, indeed, are not only the world's largest exporters 
of direct capital (with Japan), but by far its largest hosts to such 
investment, accumulating US$400bn in the US and US$200bn in the UK by 
1993.  They have also had the most dynamic economies in the 
capitalist world of late.
The key point is that foreign firms can bring not just capital, but 
fresh management and new ideas of how to produce and market goods and 
what to produce.  Business executives switching jobs around the world 
are better able to discern new global marketing and technical 
opporunities than even the best trained bankers and bureaucrats can 
at home, as Germany and France are finding to their cost. 
The Russians and other FSU economies are peculiarly suitable to host 
multinational enterprise of the sort that began to develop the US and 
Canada (whose railroads and canals were largely built by British 
capital and engineers)  over a century ago.  For they possess scant 
populations, yet abundant raw materials and energy, whose efficient 
exploitation by multinationals has made primary-producing countries, 
such as Australia and Canada, amongst the richest in the world.
The Baltic states and Kazakhstan have already set up fiscal and legal 
regimes highly favourable to foreign investment as well as open stock 
exchanges.  While the former are becoming entrepot port beneficiaries 
of the trade from a resource-rich hinterland, the Kazakhs are in its 
heart, with some 60 per cent of the FSU's mineral reserves, 
attractive to foreign investors.  Japan Chromium Corp., for instance, 
has taken over three Kazakh chrome firms, boosting the sales of two 
of them by 140 per cent over the previous year and profits by 182 per 
cent.  One of them has raised monthly output by 2,000 per cent and 
began selling for hard currency (see page 18). Kazakhstan has 
attracted some US$4bn of the US$100m committed by foreign investors 
in the entire former Soviet zone, including Central Europe.  
Sandwiched between Russia and China, Kazakhstan has geopolitical as 
well as economic reasons to raise its international profile.  But 
Russia itself could only benefit, as already has China, from 
encouraging an inflow of foreign investment to renovate its ossified 
industries.
The cash-strapped military firms striving to convert to civilian 
production and the hard-pressed Russian Space Agency (see Inside 
Track) are doing their utmost to attract foreign capital and custom.  
But the still profitable oil and gas sector, which accounts for over 
US$25bn in hard currency export revenues per annum,is convinced that 
it can overcome its problems on its own.  Its Soviet-trained 
bureaucrats are almost certainly wrong about this, ignorant of the 
extent to which say even the UK; despite BP and Shell, would have 
been unable to develop its sector of the North Sea without the help 
of US firms experienced in Alaska.
Russian Premier, Chernomyrdin, ex-head of Gazprom, has learnt a great 
deal from mixing with his Western counterparts and is pushing for 
foreigners to have a better share in the oil industry, whose present 
managers he, along with many gas managers, holds in low esteem; 
Gazprom, unlike the oil industry, has by and large sustained levels 
of production.  Under his advice, Yeltsin signed a long-awaited law 
on 1st January, allowing foreign oil and gas firms to enter into 
production-sharing agreements with the government.  But the law, 
which allows the government to change tax rates at will and 
unilaterally to re-negotiate a foreign production-sharing agreement, 
does not go far enough to allay the fears of Western energy companies 
and to unlock the multibillion dollar deals that have been on hold 
for years.  The law needs to be amended before they will take the 
plunge.
Behind the reluctance of the oil men in Russia to open up to their 
foreign equivalents is a lingering suspicion that their investment is 
the engine of Western imperialism, as Lenin declared in Imperialism; 
the Last Stage of Capitalism.  They, along with the Duma politicians 
should be sent back to study the history of the US, Canada and 
Australia, resource-rich giants, comparable to Russia, where foreign 
investment was the presiding genius of the first stage of advanced 
capitalism and a chief reason for their pre-eminence today.

ASIAN LINKS: Japan remains Maritime Territory's biggest trading partner

Japan, already by far the biggest trading partner of Russia's Far 
Eastern Maritime Territory, is set to increase its share in the 
Territory's foreign trade turnover even further this year, the 
Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS, reported on 2nd December from 
Vladivostok, quoting the head of the Far Eastern office of Japan's 
Sumitomo Corporation.
The businessman said that in 1994 Japan accounted for 57.2 per cent 
of Maritime Territory's exports and 25.6 per cent of its imports.  
Japan was followed by China with 13.6 per cent of exports and 15.4 
per cent of imports and South Korea with 13 and 16 per cent 
respectively.
Sumitomo Corporation, which co-operates with local companies in the 
Russian Far East in such diverse fields as the timber and coal 
industries, delivery of building equipment, trucks and cars, and the 
laying of telecommunication lines, accounts for over 10 per cent of 
the entire trade turnover between Maritime Territory and Japan.
Korea Tcould open northern Asia to Russian natural gasU
South Korea could play a critical role in opening northern Asian 
energy markets to Russian natural gas exports, according to a new 
study.
A report by ING Barings Bank suggests that Korea, rather than Japan, 
could play the pivotal role in unlocking Russian gas reserves in 
Eastern Siberia.  It says Korea, which is currently seen as one of 
the main targets for liquefied natural gas exports from South-East 
Asian and Middle.  Eastern gas producers, is keen to diversify its 
sources of gas supply.
Any deal involving Korean purchases of Russian gas would have a 
strong regional political dimension, says Mr Alex Stewart, the 
report's author.  Seoul has been keen to improve relations with both 
Russia and China, and a natural gas pipeline to Korea via the latter 
would be a potent political symbol of regional co-operation.
The study says Japan's hopes to tap gas from fields of the Russian 
island of Sakhalin remain frustrated because of continuing 
uncertainly over the fate of production-sharing legislation in 
Moscow.  It says the 'lingering territorial dispute with Russia over 
the Kurile islands' is an added impediment.
Mr Stewart said Korean companies had undertaken detailed studies to 
determine the viability of projects based on gas from Eastern Russia.  
But any announcement of further progress might be affected by the 
political scandals that have recently embroiled the Seoul government.

AVIATION - Russia sets up air market protection commission

The Russian government is to set up a special commission to look at 
ways of protecting Russia's traditional markets in aircraft 
construction and air transport, Interfax news agency reported on 5th 
December.  The commission is to be headed by the chairman of the CIS 
(Commonwealth of Independent States) Interstate Aviation Committee, 
Tatyana Anodina.
Interfax quoted the head of the Russian Transport Ministry's Air 
Transport Department, Vadim Zamotin, as saying that lack of airline 
purchasing power has led to a situation where domestic manufacturers 
of aircraft and spares are at a standstill or are cutting back 
production.  He said the domestic market had a requirement of 1,250 
aeroplanes and helicopters by the year 2000, by which time passenger 
air movements will have doubled to 51m a year.
There are currently 418 air companies operating in Russia, but 37 per 
cent of them account for 80 per cent of all air movements.
Moscow airports to meet international standards by year 2000
The Russian Transport Ministry and the Moscow city government have 
drawn up a comprehensive reconstruction programme designed to turn 
the Russian capital's airports into a major world transport centre by 
the year 2000, Moscow 2x2 TV has reported.
At the first stage of the programme, which is to be carried out over 
the next two years at an estimated cost of at least R1,176bn, 
runways, freight and passenger terminals and technical equipment at 
Moscow's four airports are to be brought up to international 
standards.  At the next stage, a convenient system for getting air 
passengers quickly to and from the city and between airports is to be 
introduced, 2x2 said.
The television station quoted Vadim Zamotin, director of the Russian 
Transport Ministry's Air Transport Department, as saying that at 
present Moscow's airports did not meet either international or 
domestic standards on a number of counts, including safety 
provisions.

An emergency meeting of shareholders in the oil and gas producing 
company, Kaliningradmorneftegaz, has approved its incorporation into 
Russian oil major, LUKoil, Interfax news agency reported on 30th

favour of changing the name of the company to LUKoil-
Kaliningradmorneftegaz, Valeriy Petrakov  was elected director 
general of the new corporation.
The meeting also endorsed a plan to set up a joint venture to operate 
in British and Norwegian waters.
Kaliningradmorneftegaz, which specialises in offshore fields, 
extracted 654,000t of oil and 18m cubic metres of natural gas in the 
first nine months of 1995.

ENERGY -First 11 months see shift to West in oil and gas exports

Russia exported more than 112.9m tonnes of oil worth around US$11.2bn 
in the first 11 months of last year, Interfax news agency reported, 
quoting State Statistics Committee figures, on 15th December.
The amount sold fell by 3.3 per cent by comparison with the same 
period in 1994 but the price per tonne of oil rose 12 per cent to 
average US$99.80.  Of the 11-month oil-export total, 87.8m tonnes 
went to countries outside the former Soviet Union, an increase of 2.6 
per cent on 1994.  During the same period, exports to members to the 
CIS and to the Baltic States were 19.5 per cent down on last year, at 
25m tonnes.
In November alone, Russia exported 7.2m tonnes of oil to countries 
outside the former Soviet Union and 3.9m tonnes of oil to the former 
union republics.
Exports of natural gas rose 2.5 per cent year on year during the 
period under review, with Russia exporting 173bn cubic metres, worth 
a total of US$12.1bn.  Countries outside the former Soviet Union 
received 109.9bn cubic metres of gas, a 10.5 per cent rise in 
January-November 1994.  The CIS and Baltic States received 63bn cubic 
metres, down 9.1 per cent on last year.  In November, Europe received 
11.1bn cubic metres of Russian gas and the CIS and Baltic states 
8.6bn cubic metres.
Russia's exports of petroleum products amounted to 43.9m tonnes in 
January-November, about the same as last year.  Of that total, 
countries outside the former Soviet Union received 40.6m tonnes, 11.8 
per cent up on last year's figure, and the CIS and Baltics received 
3.2m tonnes, less than half the figure for 1994.

European fashion exhibition for Russia, the CIS and the Baltic 
states, 28th February to 2nd March 1996.  They expect 150 to 200 
companies from all over the world, of which approximately 10 per cent 
are going to be from the US, will participate in the show.
ITE, the largest and most successful exhibition organiser in Russia 
and the CIS, has a complete Russian database of fashion buyers, 
maintains personal contacts in many of the principal trading 
companies, and has ready access to all Russian trade associations.

the Moscow International Travel & Tourism Show (912 exhibitors, 
92,000 visitors), Moscow International Motor Show (300 exhibitors, 
500,000 visitors), Moscow International Sport & Leisure Show (225 
exhibitors, 15,000 visitors), and Moscow International Healthcare 
Exhibition (200 exhibitors,40,000 visitors).  
Bleinheim is a leading exhibition company in Europe, with 250 trade 
shows worldwide.  It is the organiser of premier collections in the 
United Kingdom with 1,200 exhibitors from 26 countries and Mode

Moscow, offering excellent entertainment and sightseeing, providing 
easy access to visitors.  
Manezh international exhibition hall is the perfect location for a 
fashion exhibition located close to Moscow fashion boutiques, 
clothing shops and department stores.  Novy Arbat and Tverskaya

companies to reach 20,000 boutique owners, retail buyers, apparel 
distributors, trading companies and entrepreneurs.  Participating 
companies will be able to establish direct links and  an 
infrastructure that will lead to effective sales throughout Russia.
Russian apparel manufacturing has declined by 55 per cent since 1992, 
causing significant shortages of clothing.  Although much of this 
demand has been filled by US$2bn of imports annually, there is still 
unfulfilled demand for Western styles and medium to high quality 
products.

PRECIOUS METALS - Russia plans jewels exchange

Russian authorities will launch an exchange in January for uncut and 
polished diamonds, according to the head of the Russian association 
of diamond producers, the Interfax news agency reported.
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is under consideration as a possible 
co-founder, Ararat Evoyan said, with other likely co-founders being 
the Finance Ministry and the State Committee on Precious Metals.
De Beers and the Russian diamond factory adjourned talks without 
agreement.  The discussions will resume in early January, De Beers 
said in a statement released in London.
The company said the parties had agreed to extend the five-year sales 
agreement between Russia and De Beers until 1st February.  Buoyed by 
the comments from both sides, analysts expressed optimism that De 
Beers and Russia would reach a marketing agreement, but many said 
negotiations would probably drag on past 1st February.
James Allen of the stock brokerage concern, Anderson Wilson, said 
that the extension was positive, demonstrating that neither side 
wanted to walk away from a deal.
"I would personally expect the contract to be extended again before 
they reach a final agreement," he said.
Under the current deal, Russia sells 95 per cent of its rough gems 
through De Beers's Central Selling Organisation.
Russia has argued that it should be allowed to sell more stones 
independently.

Yeltsin lifts export duties on petroleum and timber products

Aleksandr Livshits, economic aide to President Yeltsin, confirmed 
that from 1st December export duties levied on most petroleum and 
timber products would be lifted and numerous other duties halved, 
Interfax news agency reported on 20th November.
Speaking at a briefing in the Kremlin on 30th November, Livshits said 
that the president had signed a decree to that effect.
The decree also imposes a ceiling on the prices of products sold by 
"natural monopolists" during the first six months of 1996.  The price 
rise will not exceed the monthly inflation rate, which is 
continuously falling, Livshits said, adding that the president had 
also issued an order for a programme of state support for exporters 
to be drawn up before 15th December.  The president was said to be 
concerned over non-raw material exports from Russia.  Livshits said 
he expected the structures of exports to change as a result of the 
decree.

STATE ECONOMIC POLICY & STATISTICS -
Russia to usher in trading in precious metals and stones

The Russian government has adopted a resolution which takes the 
country nearer to a deregulated market in precious metals and stones, 
Interfax news agency reported on 1st December, quoting the Union of 
Russian Prospectors.
The Committee for Precious Metals and Stones and the Central Bank 
will have priority access to government-determined quotas of precious 
metals and stones, and prospectors will sell the remainder to 
authorised banks.  Under the government resolution, private 
individuals may then purchase and trade gold, silver and plutonium 
ingots and gemstones, mainly through exchange dealings.
The rules governing exchange dealings are to be submitted by the 
Finance Ministry, Committee for Precious Metals and Stones and 
Central Bank within a month, with a view to trading starting up in 
the first quarter of 1996.
In addition, the Committee for Precious Metals and Stones is to issue 
certified ingots of gold, silver and plutonium, weighing between one 
and 500g.
In a further move, the government has also permitted authorised banks 
to take gold and silver ingots abroad for security operations to 
attract foreign loans.

Independent States (CIS) fell by 3.5 per cent to US$12.4bn, exports 
outside the former Soviet Union went up by 28.3 per cent to 
US$59.2bn, largely because of increased oil and gas supplies.  
Imports from the CIS rose by 24.2 per cent to US$11.5bn and imports 
from the "Far Abroad" went up by 17.3 per cent to US$29.3bn.

about 25 per cent of the country's oil exports, began loading oil 
into tankers again on the night of 10th December, Interfax news 
agency reported on 11th December.
Officials at the port said that stormy weather, with wind speeds of 
up to 30 m per second and waves as high as 2.5m, had closed the port 
on 4th December. By the evening of the 10th, there were eight tankers 
waiting to be loaded and with a good weather forecast for the next 
few days, and port facilities reported all moorings in use.

TRANSPORT - Vladivostok shipyard to service foreign ships from next year

The Dalzavod company in Vladivostok is to start servicing foreign 
ships from January 1996 following a decision by the Russian Federal 
Border Service to allow vessels under foreign flags to call at its 
port, Interfax news agency reported on 12th December.
Dalzavod, described as the biggest shipyard in the Russian Far East, 
will continue ship-building operations given that it has a new modern 
loading facility allowing it to compete with other ports in the area.
Servicing foreign ships could erase Dalzabvod's acute financial 
problems which have been caused by the Russian government's failure 
to pay for orders placed with the shipyard.

TRANSPORT - St Petersburg port goes ahead with upgrade plans

The St Petersburg Seaport is to press ahead with plans for expansion 
despite financial losses this year of between R20bn and R25bn, 
Interfax news agency reported on 10th December, quoting the general 
director of the port, Anatoliy Bilichenko.
Bilichenko attributed this year's losses to poor tax, customs and 
privatisation laws and said expansion would be carried out without 
government help.  Interfax said that the port had still to receive 
tax  concessions promised by St Petersburg mayor, Anatoliy Sobchak.
Bilichenko said that in 1996 the port would use its own money and 
investment from partners to continue the construction of a terminal 
with a final capacity of 150,000 containers a year.  It is also 
designing a terminal to handle 1m tonnes of sugar a year.  Bilichenko 
put the cost of the entire complex at between US$50m and US$55m.  He 
said that capacity at the port was expected to increase by 2m tonnes 
to 11m tonnes in 1996.

BATLIC STATES - Estonia signs up to join EU

Estonia, which was part of the Soviet Union only four years ago, 
could qualify to join the single European currency in two year's 
time.  The Estonian government, which formally applied to join the 
European Union in Brussels on 4th December, has told EU countries 
that it has gone a long way to meeting the stringent single-currency 
conditions set out in the Maastricht Treaty.
Speaking to a news conference in Brussels, the foreign minister, Siim 
Kallas, said his country was unusual in the Baltic region in having 
achieved a balanced budget and having its currency, the kroon, tied 
by law to the value of the Deutschmark.  "Estonia has no budget 
deficit, we have achieved a remarkably rapid growth and our inflation 
is falling very rapidly indeed," he said.  "On present trends we 
could meet all the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty for joining 
the single currency in two years' time."
Estonia is the fifth former Eastern bloc country to apply for EU 
membership, joining Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Latvia.  
Applications from the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia and the 
Czech Republic are expected in the next few weeks.  Both are judged 
by the EU as economically successful and possible candidates for the 
single currency.
Negotiations to enlarge the EU will not begin until the conclusion of 
the conference to review the Maastricht Treaty, which begins next 
year.  Although it may not end until 1997, there is growing pressure 
in the EU for accession negotiations to start by the beginning of 
1998, which would make it possible for some countries to join by the 
year 2000.
EU governments are worried about Russia's reaction to their accepting 
the Baltic states into full membership. But although Moscow has 
warned of a crisis if Nato accepted the Baltic states, it has made no 
such threat about EU enlargement.
"Our policy on security is very clear: Estonia wants to join Nato and 
our other security commitments in Europe will follow on that 
development," Mr Kallas said.  Estonian officials insist that Russian 
fears about their integration in Western Europe are exaggerated.
EU leaders have to decide when to begin negotiations on enlargement, 
how quickly they can be concluded and at what cost.  The likely 
outcome is an agreement to start talks no later than six months after 
the conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty review conference.  
Negotiations will be held with about 10 countries from central and 
eastern Europe.
Estonian parliament fails to approve central bank's annual report
The Riigikogu parliament on 7th December failed to endorse the Bank 
of Estonia's 1994 financial report.  Instead, it suspended the draft 
resolution's passage because of the loss of 170m kroons (US$13) on 
the bank's books.  Finance Commission chairman, Olev Raju, said that 
the Riigikogu cannot endorse the central bank's report as it stands 
because this would be in conflict with the laws.  
Under a law regulating the Bank of Estonia, the Riigikogu must 
endorse the bank's annual report every year, including its balance 
sheet and revenue and expense accounts.  The balance must also show 
any losses as well as the method of making up for them and sources 
for this.

BATLIC STATES - Lithuania approves privatisation programme

The Lithuanian cabinet has endorsed the country's privatisation 
strategy for the next five years, Lithuanian Radio reported on 6th 
December.
Under the second stage of privatisation, set to begin in early 1996, 
shares will be available for cash only, not vouchers.  The value of 
unsold state capital after the first stage of privatisation stands at 
about 7.5-8bn litas (US$1.9-2bn) and property worth 2bn litas could 
be disposed of by the year 2000, with priority being given to 
enterprises already earmarked for privatisation under the first phase 
of sell-offs.
"The government pledges not to sell property hastily or give it out.  
The main criteria will be economic and social results.  The Cabinet 
of Ministers will aspire to legalise privatisation of land not for 
agricultural use. Corporate bodies would be able to purchase the land 
together with other property," the radio station said.
The government has also pledged not to sell off strategic 
installations whose privatisation parliament has opposed.  These are 
mainly power engineering, transport and communications facilities.  
The government is also to take steps to encourage share dealing on 
the stock exchange.

GEORGIA - Georgia gets German loan to develop power engineering, agriculture

The German government has granted Georgia a long-term loan of DM50m 
(US$36m), the Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS reported from Tbilisi on 
27th November, quoting sources at the German embassy.
Of this amount, DM40m is earmarked for the development of the 
country's power engineering sector and 10m for agriculture.  The loan 
is for 40 years, with the first 10 years interest-free.  Georgia is 
to start repaying the loan in 10 years.
Georgia to extract gas from newly-found deposit in Tbilisi
Georgia is to start commercial exploitation of a natural gas deposit 
found in Tbilisi by a team of Georgian and Swiss geologists, the 
Russian news agency, ITAR-TASS, reported from the Georgian capital on 
2nd December.
Gas extraction from the deposit in Tbilisi's Varketili district is to 
begin in January 1996 and initial yield is expected to be 300 cu.m. a 
day, adding that this amount would provide enough natural gas for 
Tbilisi's industrial enterprises during the winter period.  From May 
1996, when extraction is expected to increase, some gas will also be 
supplied to household consumers in Tbilisi.
Georgia currently buys natural gas from Turkmenistan, Russia and 
other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, adding 
that in the past two years household and industrial consumers in 
Georgia had experienced great shortages in gas supplies.

RUSSIA - Moscow pledges tough line on economy

Russia's economics ministry has pledged it would continue to pursue a 
harsh monetary policy designed to stabilise the economy and cut the 
monthly rate of inflation to below 2 per cent, despite the strong 
anti-government protest vote in last month's parliamentary elections.
However, the ministry's tough stance, continued in an annual economic 
forecast, was seemingly at odds with the softer rhetoric employed by 
President Boris Yeltsin in his address to the nation on New Year's 
Eve.
"The main task for 1996 is that those in Russia who are poor should 
begin to live better," he said, promising the government would 
rectify the problem of delayed wage and pension payments which has 
caused great social distress.
Mr Yeltsin also lashed out at the corruption in finanical circles 
which was responsible for diverting money intended for social 
spending.
Mr Yeltsin criticised the economics ministry, employing rhetoric 
reminiscent of the Stalinist era to denounce "saboteurs" who were 
responsible for undermining the reform programme.
He promised to increase payments to pensioners by compensating them 
for savings eroded by the hyper-inflation of the early reform years.
Mr Yeltsin's pledges have led some economists to fear that the 
government may consider loosening its monetary policy pushing up 
inflation early this year.  The government may come under intense 
pressure to increase spending on social protection to curry electoral 
favour before the presidential election in June.
But ministers have repeatedly argued that there is no contradication 
between tight monetary policies and a rise in the standard of living.
Russia confirmed that it had missed the New Year deadline for 
destroying thousands of tanks and other military hardware beyond the 
Ural Mountains and said Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan had 
also failed to meet the treaty commitment, Reuter reports from  
Moscow.
General Dmitry Kharchenko said Moscow wanted to push the 31st 
December 1995 deadline pledged by the Soviet Union in 1991 back to 
the end of 1998.  The pledge had cleared the way for ratification of 
the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.

Economy at year-end

In comparison with the same period last year, Russia's Gross Domestic 
Product has declined by 3 per cent and industrial performance by 2 
per cent.  As before, agriculture is still in dire straits: the 
decline in gross farming output was 12 per cent, or 3 per cent 
higher.  Inflation, which was 18 per cent in January, subsided to 4.9 
per cent by early November, which might be viewed as a success but 
for the fact that it was artificially held back.  Specifically, 
inflation dynamics have been affected by international compression of 
the money supply - wage defaults and belated inflationary 
compensations; payment defaults by the state and by enterprises for 
work performed, orders filled and products supplied.  No growth in 
production as the basis for financial stabilsiation was observed, 
although certain sectors, such as steel and chemical production, are 
showing signs of recovery, reports ECONews.
The social situation is such that real incomes of the population have 
slipped by another 12 per cent.  Debts in the payment of wages by the 
state and enterprises now total over 8 trillion roubles (US$1.8bn), 
or 12 per cent more than last year.  The decreasing standard of 
living of the population, the slump in the caloric value and 
nutritiional balance of the Russians' diet and other factors have led 
to the present lower birth and higher mortality rates.  The size of 
the country's population may fall by over 1 million this year.  
Unemployment has risen sizeably: according to the International 
Labour Organisation, it is 7.8 per cent of the employable population 
(approximately 5.7m people); the Federal Employment Service has 
officially registered 2.8 million jobless on the dole.  The 
superfluous manpower potential is estimated to rise to 10 per cent or 
more (9 to 10 million people) in the near future.

RUSSIA - Coke aims to double Russian investment

Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drinks producer, is planning to 
double its investment in Russia to US$500m by the end of 1997.  The 
US group is seeking to wrest market leadership in Russia from 
PepsiCo, its rival which established a strong presence in the former 
Soviet Union through a series of barter deals during the communist 
era.
Coca-Cola began to invest heavily in central and Eastern Europe 
following the collapse of communism and, along with its bottling 
partners, is planning to spend about US$2bn in the region by the end 
of 1997.
Mr Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola president and chief operating officer, 
said the group was rapidly closing the gap on PepsiCo in Russia.  
Coca-Cola sales almost tripled in Moscow last year and overall in 
Russia had doubled in 1994.  It had quadrupled its sales volume in 
the country since it began to invest in 1991.  The group was being 
out-sold by PepsiCo by a margin of 4 to 1 in Russia two years ago, 
but the gap had fallen this year to less than 2 to 1, and Mr Ivester 
said that the "margin is now near parity."
Coca-Cola has opened a US$40m plant in St Petersburg to serve a 
market of more than 9m people in North-Western Russia.  On 1st 
December, it opened the extension of its US$65m plant in Moscow, 
where it has more than doubled capacity since it opened in April last 
year.
The US$500m investment in Russia is being made by Coca-Cola, along 
with some of its international bottling partners including Inchcape, 
the UK trading group, the Anadolu group of Turkey, and Leventis, 
which already has Coca-Cola bottling plants elsewhere, including 
Greece, Nigeria, Ireland, Bulgaria and Romania.  
In late November, Coca-Cola opened a regional office in Istanbul, as 
a springboard for expansion into Central Asia, where it is planning 
to invest more than US$100m in the next two years.  Anadolu, Turkey's 
largest brewer, has the Coca-Cola bottling rights for Turkmenistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and parts of Southern Russia.
Inchape announced in September that it was doubling its investment in 
Coca-Cola bottling plants in Russia to US$80m by the end of 1997.
The Coca-Cola system now has a workforce of more than 3,000 in 
Russia, and the US group claims that it supports a further 30,000 
jobs indirectly in local suppliers and services.  It sources locally 
around 70 per cent of the supplies and services needed for the 
production and marketing of its products in Russia.
Having trailed PepsiCo in Eastern Europe during the communist era, 
Coca-Cola claims that it now outsells its rival by 2 to 1 throughout 
the region.

RUSSIA - Daily bread

Today in Russia a loaf of bread costs twice as much as it did a year 
before.  Tomorrow it may cost even more, certain experts forecast, 
reports ECONews.
Their predictions are based on this year's extremely low harvest of 
grain, primarily wheat.  Twenty three per cent less of it has been 
harvested in hopper weight.  The explanations for the lean harvest 
include unfavourable weather, the general farming crisis and 
inadequate financial support from the state.
Public pronouncements that Russia will not import grain any more are 
now being corrected.  Grains (primarily food) will have to be 
imported because, in addition to crop failure, the main Russian 
producers - Kuban and the Stavropol Territory - have gathered in 
disease-stricken wheat which is unfit for baking good bread.  
For this reason Russia's bread-basket, the Don region, has to buy 
wheat abroad, particularly from Hungary, with which it has signed an 
agreement.  In all, 50,000 tonnes of American wheat will be supplied 
to the Voronezh Region, which has also signed a wheat agreement. 
To carry over till next harvest Russia needs at least 10 to 12 
million tonnes of imported grains, mostly food.  Owing to the 
unfavourable situation on the world grain market, the price of grain 
is fluctuating between US$200 and 400 per tonne.

RUSSIA - Problems of comparatively prosperous sectors

One of the most well-off sectors of Russia's economy, the oil 
industry, has of late been facing the same problems as other sectors 
- production fall, default, lack of resources for settlements with 
the budget and wage settlements.  Over nine months the production of 
oil has declined by 4 per cent due to a 6 per cent drop in 
development drilling; the installation of new wells has decreased by 
11 per cent, reports ECONews.
Experts from the Oil and Gas Industrialists' Union are of the same 
mind, though they look deeper into the situation:  "The lack of a 
nominal pricing policy in general, and particularly regarding fuel 
and energy resources; the failure of debtors to pay for fuel 
supplies, including those to CIS countries; the default crisis and 
the tough tax pressures - all this leads, and has already led, to the 
fall of oil production in Russia.  Today tax repayments take more 
than 70 per cent of the profits of oilmen and up to 75 per cent of 
those of gas producers.  Over one-third of the nation's oil wells are 
currently idle, and more than half of all hardware components have 
substantially deteriorated."
Looking into possible sources of financing for the 1996 budget 
deficit, oil and gas industrialists note that much weight has been 
given to receipts from monetary privatisation, above all the 
auctioning of state-held controlling blocks of shares of enterprises 
which are still afloat, including some in the oil and gas complexes.
It is intriguing that the fall in the production of oil and the 
general crisis in the sector are taking place against the background 
of increasing exports of crude oil and products of oil refining.  So 
far, specialists cannot say what the abolition of export taxes and 
quotas of oil and oil products will mean for Russia.  Additional 
billions of dollars for exporters are involved and no-one knows where 
they will end up.

RUSSIA - Sakhalin oilmen lay 7-km underwater pipeline and boost oil extraction

A 7-km underwater oil pipeline has been laid linking Sakhalin Island 
to mainland Russia, Russian Public TV has reported. 
The pipeline, under the Tatarskiy Proliv strait, is the third stage 
of a link between the oil town of Okha, in northern Sakhalin, and the 
town of Komsomolsk-na-Amure on the far Eastern mainland.  The 
underwater section was laid by a team from the 
Sakhalinmorneftemontazh, or Sakhalin offshore oil assembly, company 
and a floating crane from the far Eastern port of Nakhodka.
Oil and gas extraction on Sakhalin are up 13 per cent on last year's 
figures, despite a devastating earthquake in May which damaged over 
500km of main pipeline, power transmission lines, roads, railways and 
dozens of oil and gas wells, to a total cost of R652bn.  Following 
the earthquake, Sakhalin oil companies were permitted to sell 500,000 
tonnes of crude oil abroad free of export duty in order to finance 
reconstruction.

RUSSIA - Many Russian oilfields have high water conten

Experts of the Infotek financial company have concluded that 
currently Russia's recovered oil deposits are flooded by 71.54 per 
cent on average, having analysed data on producing oil fields 
presented by 30 of the largest oil companies in Russia.
The water content in the recovered liquid is the most important 
characteristic of the recovered deposit.  At the beginning of the 
development, oil is almost pure.  As the oil content decreases with 
further extraction, the water content increases both during the use 
of correct and incorrect technology.  As a rule, when the water 
content exceeds 90 per cent, the deposit becomes unprofitable. This 
signifies the beginning of the deposit's end.
Nizhevartovskneftegaz's (nearly 94 per cent) and Bashneft's (over 92 
per cent) fields have the highest water content.  Another nine of 
Russia's largest oil companies are on the verge with 80 per cent 
water content, such as Kondpetroleum, Meginneftegaz, Sakhalin-
morneftegaz, and Tatneft.

RUSSIA - Kabardino-Balkaria becomes oil republic

Russia's southern constituent republic of Kabardino-Balkaria has 
begun commercial production of oil, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 
1st December.
Quoting a republican government source, the agency said an oil well 
which it named as Kharbizhenskaya had "excellent" prospects and that 
Kabardino-Balkaria "is becoming an oil producing republic."
Initially oil will be carried by tankers for refining in neighbouring 
Ingushetia.  Later, refining equipment, paid for out of federal 
funds, is to be imported from abroad for assembly in the republic.
Groznyy oil refinery covering most of Chechnya's fuel requirements
The Groznyy oil refinery is currently producing 1,500 tonnes of 
petroleum products a day, oil refinery director, Ramzan Zakayev, told 
Interfax on 11th November.  After the restoration operation is 
completed next year the oil refinery will be capable of annually
producing about 10m tonnes of petroleum products, Zakayev said.
The Groznyy oil refinery nearly fully meets Chechnya's needs in 
kerosene, diesel fuel and fuel oil, he said.  After the restoration 
operation is completed, the oil refinery will also meet Chechnya's 
need in high-octance petrol, Zakayev said.
The Groznyy oil refinery's performance was suspended in December 1994 
after military actions were launched in Chechnya.  The oil refinery 
resumed work several months ago, Zakayev said.  
Oil storages were almost fully destroyed and equipment from pump 
stations was stolen during the military actions, Zakayev told 
Interfax..
Zakayev said 7,500 employees were currently working at the oil 
refinery, or 1,000 people fewer than before the armed conflict.  He 
said about 3,000 employees had to take forced leave because the 
restoration operation had not so far been completed.  
Zakayev said the average wage at the oil refinery was about R500,000, 
reports Interfax.  
With regard to wage arrears, Zakayev said the debt on wages for the 
last year and seven months of 1995 had been paid off with the 
assistance from the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry and the state 
commission for rebuilding the Chechen economy, led by Russian First 
Deputy Prime Minister, Oleg Soskovets.

RUSSIA - Power industry

According to the forecasts made by experts of the industry, the 
aggregate capacity of the Russian power plants will amount to about 
200 gigawatts by the year 2000, a decrease of 12 gigawatts compared 
to the present level, reports ECONews.
The exhaustion of the service life of many thermal power plants, 
which now account for 70 per cent of the total output of electricity, 
and meet nearly half of the country's requirements for heat, is the 
root cause of the expected drop.  To prevent such a decline, it is 
necessary to put annually into operation facilities able to generate 
8-9 gigawatts of electricity, in order to compensate for the closure 
of worn-out ones.  It is noteworthy that, despite the decline, the 
sector remains a major exporter of electricity, supplying up to 
twenty billion kilowatt-hours per annum to Western Europe alone.

RUSSIA - Coal industry

If nothing unforeseen happens, the coal industry should become 
profitable within the next five-seven years.  This forecast was made 
by general director of the Rosugol state company, Yuri Malyshev.  The 
progressive movement in this direction has been achieved through the 
shut-down of the loss-making coal mines - 34 collieries have ceased 
to exist over the past eighteen months, reports ECONews.
The wage-payment arrears, which now total nearly one-trillon roubles, 
are the most pressing problem in the industry at the present time.  
Approximately 70 per cent of them stem from non-payments by coal 
consumers, and 30 per cent from sluggish federal budget financing. 
During the past three months alone, the deficit of the budget 
financing of the coal sector reached 116 trillion roubles.
The government views regional and inter-regional mutual settlements, 
as well as the introduction of a market mechanism for charging 
overdue debts towards debtors' property, as a way to resolve the non-
payments problem.  Such tough sanctions will not affect enterprises 
of the munitions industry and higher education establishments. 
Vladimir Gusev, the chairman of the State Duma committee for 
industry, construction, transport and energy, believes that the "coal 
crisis" can be ended through immediate payment of the federal debts 
to the coal workers.  This can be done by working out and fulfilling 
a state programme of restructuring the industry, with due account 
taken of the specific economic and social features of the country's 
coal fields, and by ensuring the spending of the subsidies from the 
federal budget mainly on the development of production, restructuring 
of enterprises, and material support to miners who lose their jobs as 
a result of the shut-down of coal production units.
Russia expected to produce 122 tonnes of gold in 1995
Russia is expected to extract 122 tonnes of gold by the end of 1995, 
down from 131  last year, Interfax news agency reported on 29th 
November, quoting an unnamed official from the Russian Federation 
Committee for Precious Metals and Stones.
The official said the country's total gold production for 1995, 
including gold obtained from mine tailings and waste, could reach 
129t, compared with 142.6t in 1994.  Up to November, gold-extracting 
enterprises have produced over 100t.
The committee official was also quoted as saying advance payments to 
gold-producing enterprises, which were due to begin in November, had 
to be postponed after the president ordered the government to sell 
part of Russia's gold reserves to pay pensions.  He said, however, 
that the money was coming "in the very near future."  Gold producers 
are expected to receive in prepayments 25 per cent of the value of 
their 130t quota for 1996.  Those operating "in particularly hard 
conditions" could get as much as 50 per cent, compared with 35 per 
cent in 1995.

About 12 tonnes of gold have been produced by the mines in Amur 
Region in the Russian Far East since the beginning of the year, 
Interfax news agency reported from the regional capital, 
Blagoveshchensk, on 4th December.
The agency quoted the deputy head of the regional administration as 
saying, Amur Region was Russia's third-largest gold producer, behind 
Yakutia, and Magadan Region.  The Russian government is currently 
considering extending a credit to the Region to develop the 
Pokrovskoy gold mine and began jewellery production in co-operation 
with Italian and Indian companies.

RUSSIA - Privatisation: Facts and Figures

The share of the private (privatised) sector of the Russian economy 
in the creation of the Gross Domestic Product of the Russian 
Federation has exceeded the share of the state sector, and keeps 
growing steadily.  The income from the privatisation stage of 1992, 
amounted to 56.2bn roubles (14.6bn were transferred to the federal 
budget); in 1993, some 355bn was earned (71.1bn); in 1994, 984bn 
(117.4bn); and in 1995 the total income from the privatisation is 
expected to be around 24 trillion roubles (US$4.8bn), of which 9.3 
per cent are destined for the national treasury.  As of 1st October 
1995, a mere 162bn roubles had been received.  
A sum total of revenues from privatisation, amounting to 11.4 
trillion roubles, has been included in calculations for the draft 
budget for 1996, reports ECONews.
According to the calculations by the Institute for Economic Analysis, 
the nominal income from privatisation, taking the inflation index 
into account, i.e, its real value, has dropped by 34 per cent, and 
the federal budget revenues by 49 per cent as against 1992.  The 
figures were down by 13 and 48 per cent respectively in 1994 
(compared to the previous year), and this trend is expected to 
persist in 1995.  Approximately 20 per cent of all receipts are spent 
on financing the privatisation process itself, and on the maintenance 
of the agencies which carry it out.
Of the enterprises privatised in 1995, 38 per cent were in the 
industrial sector, 18 in construction, 11 in trade, 6.2 in transport, 
and 4.5 per cent in science; 34 per cent of the 279 million shares 
issued in the country of "privatisation-95," were bought by the 
personnel of those enterprises, and 6 per cent were sold to trust and 
holding companies.  
Approximately 84m shares were sold on the free market, and 40m of 
them have not been sold yet.  The controlling blocks of shares, owned 
by the state, comprises 67m shares with a nominal value of 51.3bn 
roubles.

UKRAINE - Social pressures prevent closure of Ukraine's inefficient coal mines

Ukraine's coal production will be down another 11.1 per cent this 
year at 83.9m tonnes, according to the latest government estimate.  
The continuing slide - from 179m tonnes in 1990 - will force the once 
mighty coal producer to raise imports next year to 20m tonnes at an 
estimated cost of US$500m, the Kiev parliament's budget committee 
chairman has announced.  Russia and Poland are to supply the bulk of 
the coal, as in the past two years.
However, Ukraine also plans to export 3m tonnes of coal next year, 
mostly to Western countries, which pay with much-needed hard 
currency.  Imports are usually paid for by barter and domestic prices 
are regulated.  The country imported an estimated 12.3m tonnes in the 
first nine months of this year and exported 1.7m tonnes, worth 
US$51m.
Exhausted pits and antiquated technology are at the root of the 
crisis in the mining sector, which mirrors the broader economic 
downturn in Ukraine.
The government this year cut all support, after propping up 
inefficient producers with monthly US$50m subsidies in 1994.
But the cabinet's decision in May to close 15 pits and a coal mining 
strip by the new year - emergency measures designed to push ahead 
economic reform - was not backed by the necessary political will.  Mr 
Oleksandr Kolosok, spokesman for the coal ministry, has said the 
closure had been indefinitely postponed.  "The main problem is 
people: the mines can't be closed because entire towns completely 
depend on them," he said.  RIf you close the mine, everyone will be 
left without jobs or support.  The young can find other work but what 
about the older pensioners?"
He added that the government lacked funding to close the mines 
properly, and continuing to operate them was cheaper.  The World Bank 
is considering a loan of up to US$80m to cover all closure costs.
All the 257 mines remain open.  But with wages falling and often left 
unpaid, the number of miners this year fell 9.3 per cent to 426,017, 
down from 529,000 in 1992, according to coal ministry statistics.

                (million tonnes)        miners

1994              94.44         469,690
1993            115.74          509,357

1989            179.21          n/a
*estimated

The political fear centres around labour unrest and unemployment, 
which could destabilise the government.  In December, Kiev agreed to 
pay US$270m in back pay - a potentially inflation-stoking settlement 
- after a large walkout in the coal-rich eastern Donbass region.  
Most Ukrainians live in the eastern regions, which spent the longest 
time under communism and may be most open to Russian revanchism.
Some miners support closures to concentrate resources in the better 
pits and compete with Russian mines, where many Ukrainians now work.  
But Mr Kolosok argued that Ukraine could not compete with Russia, 
whose mines are mechanised and more efficient.
The mining sector also has been hurt by the government's reluctance 
to liberalise domestic energy prices.  In a recent interview, Mr 
Evhen Marchuk, Ukraine's prime minister, said household tariffs, now 
at 60 per cent cost recovery, will cover 80 per cent next year and 
full cost by 1997.  He added full liberalisation, expected by the new 
year, had to be postponed.  Industrial users are charged the market 
price, but payment discipline among the largely unprofitable state 
sector remains poor.
As the government slows painful restructuring the mines are taking a 
heavy environmental and health toll.  The pits contribute 3 per cent 
of the world's emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas associated with 
global warming.
Gas de France, Charbonnages de France, and Hunosa, a Spanish coal 
mining company, this year started to look at developing coal gas 
methane in a project funded by the European Union.  But the gas is 
not trapped and sold at present.
In December, two miners died in separate accidents in Donetsk, the 
capital of the Donbass region.  By this year, the fatality rate among 
Ukrainian miners rose to five per 1m tonnes of coal produced, the 
highest in the world, according to Mr Kolosok.

UKRAINE - Opportunity knocks for Kiev

Imagine a capital city in Europe where there is such a storage of 
office space that embassies are run from hotels rooms and 
multinational subsidiaries work from suburban houses.  That city is 
Kiev, capital of Ukraine. which is one of the largest countries in 
Europe.
Property consultant, Aldon Ferguson, believes opportunities in Kiev 
are enormous "since there are hardly any quality office buildings and 
only one good hotel: the 25-room Domus, refurbished by an Italian 
company"S
More foreign companies are opening up in the city, joining the 
growing list of blue chip concerns that include Philip Morris, 
Motorola, Siemens and large,  international accountancy practices.  
Ferguson, who pioneered Western property consultancies in Moscow and 
St Petersburg before selling out to DTZ Debenham Zadelhoff, said:  
"Kiev is the capital of a large country and will need to build all 
the facilities that suit that position"S
Canadians are further down the road than most in investing in Kiev 
because of a large expatriate Ukrainian population in their country, 
although Austrian and Dutch banks are also ready to put money into 
the city; but as with anywhere else in the former communist bloc, the 
route to successful investing is strewn with pitfalls, not least by 
the conflicting views of the local authority and national government 
in Kiev.
The result is that although Western companies are desperate for 
accommodation, they are reluctant to own buildings, a difficult 
enough task in any case.  A developer, or occupier, needs a 
refurbishment certificate to obtain a 49-year lease which is 
automatically renewable.
Ferguson calculates that a developer would need to spend US$2,000 a 
square metre on buying an interest and refurbishing it to a high 
standard.
An example of the potential for developers is that refurbishing a 1-
000 square metre for US$25m will bring in an annual rent of 
US$720,000 on a five year lease, with the first five year's rent in 
advance.
While this is an attractive proposition, the difficulty is to 
persuade companies to pre-let a building before construction starts.
Another aspect of the economic situation in Ukraine is that 
successful local entrepreneurs tend to move their money out of the 
country rather than spending it locally.
But, Ferguson believes that, potentially, Ukraine is a rich country.  
For centuries it has been referred to as the breadbasket of Europe 
because of its high grain production.  The Black Sea ports should 
become successful with the expansion of trade with Russia and other 
countries in the region.  And, while it may not be politically 
correct to mention it, Ukrainians are such heavy smokers that the 
large tobacco companies, Philip Morris and BAT, see a sizeable market 
for their products.

AVIATION - Defence Ministry stalls on rocket engine export deal

US and manufacture them there under licence are on hold following 
calls from Russia's Defence Ministry, to examine the economic and 
military implications of the deal, Interfax news agency reported on 
6th December.  The contract was concluded between Aerojet of the US 
and Samara-based Dvigateli NK.
A senior Defence Ministry official explained that although the 
original Lockheed Martin tender to find the best engine for the Atlas 
booster had envisaged only commercial launches "the US side changed 
the competition terms in November 1995S and there are now concerns 
that boosters with Russian engines could be used for military 
purposes.  The Defence Ministry has urged further examination of the 
contract since it has no authority to grant or deny export 
permission, which is the government's prerogative.
In addition, he said that the contractual price of an NK-33 engine, 
estimated at US$1.1m, not only failed to meet production costs but 
was much lower than world prices for analogous products, while US$5m 
for a licence to produce NK-33 engines in the US was simply Rabsurd."  
"Equipment of such a high level costs at least from US$100m to 
US$150m."
The official questioned whether the NK-33 project was the most 
economically-advantageous option.  He claimed that the contract to 
sell NK-33s in the US would bring Russia only US$100m, whereas Pratt 
& Whitney, also of the US, was willing to invest US$150m in the the 
state-run Energomnash company in the initial phase of co-operation, 
with a view to joint production of a new generation engine.  Under 
this alternative scheme, RProduction of RD-180 engines in Russia will 
allow Russia to receive orders worth over US$1bn within 20 years."
In a separate report, Interfax quoted the head of Aerojet's advanced 
research department, Mark Constantine, as telling a news conference 
in Sacramento, California, that he acknowledged Russian concerns but 
did not agree with them.  "Fifty per cent of modernised Atlas, Delta 
and Titan boosters with Russian engines are to be used for commercial 
flights and the remainder, for the sounding and photographing of the 
Earth, launch of cartographic satellites and monitoring the launches 
of ballistic missiles in third countries," he said.
Interfax said that Russia could lose more than US$350m unless 
permission to move the engines out of Russia and the licence for 
their manufacture in the US were forthcoming in the near future.  The 
NK-33, a reusable engine, was developed 25 years ago for the N-1 
booster which was to be used in the Soviet lunar programme.
On 9th December, Interfax said that the Aerojet contract to export 72 
NK-33 engines to the US was worth US$350m.

AVIATION - Russia to repay debt to Finland in surface to air missiles

Russia is to export air defence missile systems to Finland to clear 
part of a debt owed by the former Soviet Union, Russia's ITAR-TASS 
news agency reported on 30th November from Helsinki.
An agreement was reached at the end of a three-day conference of 
Russian and Finnish defence experts to export 1bn Finnish markka 
(US$230m) worth of Buk M1 missiles, known in the West as SA-11, to 
provide air defence around Helsinki.  The terms of the export 
contract have not yet been set, but deliveries are likely to start in 
1996.
The agency quoted Finnish Minister of Defence, Anneli Taina, as 
saying that the agreement was a major step towards resolving the 
issue of Russia's debt to Finland, which has been impeding trade 
between the two countries.  The debt owed by the former Soviet Union 
and taken on by Russia totals 5.5bn Finnish markka (US$1.25bn).
RIA news agency said the new missiles would replace the current 
Pechora (SA-3) air defence system around Helsinki by the year 2000.  
RIA quoted the chief of the Finnish defence forces, Gustav Heglund, 
as saying Finland relied on missile defences and not on aviation to 
ward off air attack, and that Finnish specialists had assessed the 
SA-11 as being best suited to the task.  "The high technical 
characteristics and quality of the system determined our choice," 
Heglund said.

BROADCASTING & TELECOMMUNICATIONS -
Italian group denies Russian telecom deal is off

Stet was still interested in acquiring a 25 per cent stake in Sviazinvest, 
the Russian telephone company due for privatisation, despite an 
official Russian notice that the deal was off.
In a statement issued on 26th December, the Italian group also denied 
that the recent Russian parliamentary elections had contributed to 
the failure to secure a deal planned by 22nd December.
The statement said complex legal considerations and the need for 
adequate guarantees had helped to postpone the purchase, which would 
cost Stet US$640m, with a commitment to invest a further US$770m.
Despite the Italian insistence on pressing ahead with the operation, 
Mr Maxim Boyko, head of the Russian Privatisation Centre, said that 
Stet would no longer be investing in Sviazinvest.  He said:  
"Although it was a difficult decision to reject the final conditions 
offered by Stet it was the right decision and I do not regret it."
Mr Boyko went on to describe Stet's behaviour as "impossible to 
understand" and he expressed confidence that the shares would be sold 
next year on terms considerably more favourable than those offered by 
Stet.
He discounted the political risk in delaying the tender until next 
year:  "I don't think that in the short run the political constraints 
would prevent the tender from happening."
The Russians objected to the recent demand by Stet that an escrow 
account be set up to hold the funds for investment until all the 
conditions sought by the Italians had been met.  Officials argued 
that the request showed an inappropriate distrust of the Russian 
government and unfairly went beyond the terms of the initial tender.
A Russian statement issued on 25th December said:  "Despite the 
desire of the Russian government to find a compromise, Stet insisted 
upon forms of payment that went beyond the conditions of the tender."
But Stet has said that the company had to be prudent and the escrow 
account was intended to demonstrate such prudence.  Stet's shares 
rose 2.2 per cent at  the news on the Milan bourse.  Analysts said 
the markets had regarded the Russian attempt to cancel the deal with 
scepticism, as Stet's offer was some US$200m above the nearest bid.
Stet has set five conditions for the completion of the acquisition.  
The most important of these centres on a clarification of the 
relationship between Sviazinvest and Rostelecom, the main Russian 
telecommunications company.
Sviazinvest is now a holding company for 85 regional telecoms firms 
in a so far ill-defined role.  Stet has not yet been satisfied 
regarding the role of those regional companies or future tariff 
structure.  These are also questions about long distance traffic 
within Russia and the valuable international telecoms business.
Until now Stet has tried and failed to break into large international 
telecoms contracts and business.  In Eastern Europe it has twice been 
passed over despite higher bids in Hungary and the Czech Republic in 
privatisation programmes.
It has been left to pick business in Latin American privatisations, 
being present in Argentina and latterly Bolivia.  Thus, the Russian 
deal was seen as an important opportunity.
From Russia's perspective, the reformist camp in the government has 
been anxious to make the telecoms sector a model for state 
divestment. This was particularly important for Mr Anatoly Chubais, 
the deputy prime minister and architect of Russian reforms, who was 
the main force behind telecoms privatisation.
The bond mass privatisation programme which Mr Chubais launched in 
1992 earned Russia praise for its swift reforms:  But last year, the 
country's privatisation record was marked by the second stage of 
privatisation which many observers have criticised as a secretive 
process, arranged to benefit government insiders.
For the Russian government, the telecoms privatisation was envisioned 
as an important source of budgetary revenue in 1995.  Moscow's urgent 
need to cover the deficit was one reason the government sought to 
push through the deal rapidly.  However, the government may prefer to 
proceed at a more leisurely pace now that the urgency which drove the 
tender has evaporated.

Latvia and Belarus arrange direct fibre-optic telephone link
The Lattelekom company has concluded an agreement with its Belarusian 
counterpart, Beltelecom, on a fibreoptic cable link between the 
national telecommunication networks of the two countries.
The connection is expected greatly to improve the quality of 
communications.  The agreement also provides for transition to 
digital networks.  Currently, Latvia and Belarus are connected by 120 
analogue lines, two-thirds of which run through Lithuania, while the 
rest go via Russia.  After the new system is introduced, Latvia and 
Belarus will no longer have to use the services of third countries.
The agreement is effective from 1996, after Lattelekom has an optical 
cable in place up to the country's eastern town of Kraslava.

Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan join international fibre-optic 
project

Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan have decided to join an 
international project to lay a transcontinental fibre-optic 
communications line between Europe and Asia, Russia's Interfax news 
agency reported on 1st December.  The decision followed a two-day 
conference on the project, which ended in the Azerbaijani capital, 
Baku, on 30th November.
The 24,000-km-long communications line will connect Frankfurt-am-Main 
in Germany with Shanghai in China and will pass through Austria, 
Romania, Hungary, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, 
Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  It is due for completion by

ENERGY -Winners of LUKoil investment tender announced

The Russian investment company, Nikoil, has won an investment auction 
for a 16.07 per cent stake in LUkoil, Russia's biggest oil company, 
Interfax news agency reported on 28th December.
Nikoil won the auction with a pledge to invest R800bn, outbidding the 
only other contender, Yedinstvo-94, which offered R799bn.  Interfax 
quoted LUKoil officials as saying the investment programme for 1996-
1997 aimed to upgrade the company's refineries in Perm in the Urals 
and in Volgorad in Southern Russia, increasing the depth of refining 
there to 86-88 per cent, bringing quality in line with international 
standards and reducing production costs.
ITAR-TASS news agency said Nikoil had pledged to invest R160bn in the 
programme in January 1996, another R291bn before the end of 1996 and 
R349bn in 1997.  The implementation of the programme is expected to 
increase LUKoil's total annual output of oil products by 4m tonnes, 
including petrol output by 2m.
LUKoil incorporates seven oil producers and two oil refineries, 
Interfax recalled, adding that its annual output exceeded 50m tonnes 
of crude. 
Oil companies sign deal to develop new Caspian field
Oil companies from Azerbaijan, Russia the United States and Italy

ENERGY - Russia,Total heading for oil and gas co-operation project

Russia plans to sign an agreement with France's Total to launch a 
joint oil and gas project in northern Russia, Interfax  reports.
The project, recently given the go-ahead by the Russian government,  
needs the approval of the administratation of the Nenets Autonomous 
Area, where the development work is to be launched to extact oil and 
gas condensate from the Kharyaginskoye desposit, which has estimated 
reserves of 160.4m tonnes.  Total is to invest US$1bn in the project.
Interfax quoted sources in the Nenets administration as saying 
approval for the agreements could prove difficult, since its 
opponents believed it did not allow the Russian side to seek greater 
participation in the project.  Meanwhile the Russian government's 
Expert Council said after studying the project that  a high content 
of hydrogen sulphide (up to 4 per cent) and parafinn (up to 20-25 per 
cent) in casing-head gas would necessitate the use of special anti-
corrosion equipment and technologies, which made the participation of 
Russian construction companies in the project doubtful.

Iran has rejected an Azerbaijani offer of a share in the development 
of the Shakhdeniz oil and gas field in Azerbaijan's sector of the 
Caspian Sea, the Russian news agency reported from Tehran on 9th 
December.
The agency quoted an unnamed official at the Iranian Oil Ministry as 
saying that until "the question of the Caspian legal status and 
division of oil and gas field zones between the coastal states" was 
settled, Iranian participation in the development of Azerbaijani and 
other Caspian fields was "problematic."
The official said Iran was interested in joint oil development

to the Russian oil company, LUKoil, on 10 projects in the Gulf with 
costs ranging between US$1bn and US$4.5bn.
French-Norwegian alliance wins tender for operations in Caspian
A French-Norwegian alliance has won a tender to form a joint venture

company, Comex, which produces diving equipment and underwater 
structures and develops underwater technologies, and a Norweigan 
company, identified as Stolp Komex Seaways, which constructs, 
inspects and repairs underwater pipelines.
Pyotr Gurtovenko of the Azerbaijani State Oil Company, told Interfax 
that the joint venture would be formed on the basis of the underwater 
and rescue operations department of his company.
He added that the involvement of such a strong alliance would help 
the new venture obtain an international certificate for underwater

Russia is to help China construct a heat and power station in the 
east of Beijing, which, when operational, will supply the whole of 
the east of the city with electricity and hot water,  reports the 
ITAR-TASS news agency.
The Huaneng-Beijing heat and power plant will have four power units 
and a total capacity of 654MW.
A spokesman for the Russian company, Energomasheksport, said that 
Russian organisations had completed design work on the plant and 40 
per cent of material and equipment had been delivered to the site.  
Given the "serious lack of demand" in the Russian economy, the 
project was supplying many Russian companies with major orders, the 
spokesman said, noting that more than 120 Russian enterprises were 
involved in the project.  In addition, for the first time in a 
Russian-Chinese projects accounts in the US$127.8m contract would be 
settled in convertible currencywhich was an "excellent opportunity" 
for Russian firms, he said.
Energomasheksport is contracted to carry out assembly work, supervise 
construction and train Chinese specialists.
Russia to resume Iranian nuclear plant construction early next year
Russia is likely to resume the construction of the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant in Southern Iran in January or February 1996, the Russian 
news agency ITAR-TASS  news agency  reports from Tehran, quoting 
Valentin Rumyantsev, head of the Russian trade mission there.  
Rumyantsev said, however, that a lot depended on the timely transfer 
of Iranian payments to the accounts of Russian organisations.  Under 
the terms of the US$800m contract, Iran must transfer to the Rusisan 
side at least 10 per cent of the project's cost, or about US$58m, in 
hard currency.  Other payments are to be made in Iranian currency, 
the rial, and in goods.
The contract to complete the construction of the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant by Russia was signed in Teheran in January 1995 and comes 
into force at the end of the year.  It said a delegation of experts 
from the Russian organisations involved in the project was to arrive 
in Tehran on 24th November to discuss a number of finanical and 
technical issues and to sign documents.

in the US.
According to Yuriy Milov, photographs of some areas in the American 
states of Florida, South and North Carolina and Alabama, as well as 
in some countries in the Asian Pacific region will be taken by the 
well-known Kosmos satellite which the machine-building works in 
Samara has been producing for over 15 years.  The task of the US 
companies will be to process and sell the photographs.  Their exact 
price has not yet been fixed but according to Yuriy Milov, it will be 
without consumer research.  
The joint venture will start operating in the middle of 1996.  Both 
the Russian and the American side preferred to keep silent on the 
subject of the contract's overall value.

SPACE - Georgia joins Russia in developing new space system

Georgia has become Russia's partner in creating a new-generating 
space system.  According to an agreement with the Russian Kometa 
central scientfiic production association, the local space 
consturction instutute will be manufacturing a folding antenna for 
the new system.
An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told on recently that the 
implementation of this project will provide an additional 12,500 
radiotelephonic communications channels, which will be run by means 
of two satellites.  First reports say that Georgian specialists will 
have to meet up to 15% of the budget costs of the whole project. 
Foreign investors have shown interest in this concept and 
representatives of banking circles in Switzerland and Liechtenstein 
have already visited Georgia.

TRANSPORT - Kraysnoye Sormovo shipyard allowed to sell submarine abroad

The Russian defence Ministry, has allowed the Krasnoye Sormovo 
shipyard in Nizhniy Novgorod to complete the construction of a 
Varshavyanka-class diesel-powered submarine begun in 1992, and sell 
it abroad, Interfax news agency reported on 12th December, from the 
city, quoting a source in the shipyard's management.
The ministry said, however, that it could not provide the plant with 
the necessary funding for the project.  Krasnoye Sormovo is now 
looking for a buyer for the submarine and for a creditor to provide 
funds to complete its construction.
Two Varshavyanka submarines were sold to the Chinese Navy earlier in 
the year for an estimated US$200-250m.  The shipyard has also held 
sales negotiations with Indonesia, India and Malaysia.
The volume of production at Krasnoye Sormovo fell by 27 per cent this 
year, largely because of the lack of solvent demand for its civilian 
output and the state's failure to order submarines.  The plant's only 
profit-yielding project is the production of river-sea cargo vessels.

Japanese bank to sign US$150m loan agreement with Kamaz

The Export-Import Bank of Japan is to grant Russia a US$150m loan to 
upgrade the Kamaz vehicle works in Tolyatti, ITAR-TASS news agency 
reported recently.
The agreement was described by the agency as "the last step in the 
creation of a legal framework for granting Russia a package of 
industrial loans" worth a total of US$400m.
Documents signed earlier in the year granted the Impuls works in St 
Petersburg a loan of US$50m and the Yaroslavl oil refinery US$200m.  
Money from the US$400m loan package is to be spent on purchasing 
plant for the Russian firms from Japan, via the Kanematsu trading 
company.

AUTOMOBILE & AVIATION -
Company formed to modernise Moscow's airports; foreign investors needed

Transport on 28th November, decided to set up a new company, Aero-
Moskva, to gradually modernise the four airports - Sheremetyevo, 
Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Bykovo - that make up the hub of Russia's 
airways.
Vadim Zamotin, director of the Department of Air Transport of the 
Russian Transport Ministry, said the company would be made up of 
federal government shares of 50 per cent in Sheremetyevo, 50 per cent 
in Domodedovo, 25.5 per cent of Bykovo-Avia and 15.5 per cent of 
Vnukovo.  Overall, Moscow plans to borrow US$300m from the World Bank 
to modernise the hub, money that should be supplemented by the 
government, airlines, the airports themselves and foreign and 
domestic investors.  The airports, moreover, will be exempt from 
local and federal taxes.  So will anybody who invests in them.
There has not been any real capital investment in airports for the 
last five years, Zamotin said.  Problems with capacity and flight 
safety could emerge by the end of the century if something is not 
done now, he said.  
Passenger service, he admitted, falls well below international 
standards.  The whole system of flight control needs to be renovated.  
The Ministry of Transport, Zamotin said, has drawn up a US$5bn 
investment programme to take the hub to the year 2025.  Immediate 
problems should be solved by 1997, (when Moscow is due to mark its 
850th anniversary) at a cost of R1,276bn.
The four Moscow airports account for 27 per cent and 17 per cent of 
all domestic passenger and freight turnover and 74 per cent of 
international passenger traffic.  Over 70 airlines are based in the 
city and region of Moscow.

BANKING - Latvian Universal Bank signs agreement with EBRD

credit agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD), Latvia radio reported on 7th December.
Unibanka will receive US$20m over six years as loan capital for 
various  projects.  The EBRD already has credit lines to Latvia's 
Zemes Banka (Land Bank) and the Vacijas-Latvijas Banka (German-
Latvian Bank).
Bank of Latvia revokes licences of six commercial banks
The Bank of Latvia has revoked the licences of the Latvian Deposit 
Bank (LDB), Central Bank, the Liepaja commercial bank, the Alejas 
commercial bank, Olti-Bank and the Lettika commercial bank, Baltic 
News Service reported from Riga on 6th December, quoting Centre 
Bank's press centre.
The Latvian Commercial Court declared Centre Bank insolvent on 6th 
June, LDB on 12th June, Liepaja commercial bank on 14th June, the 
Alejas commercial bank on 10th July, and the Olti-Bank on 15th 
November.  A decision to liquidate Olti-Bank was taken on 15th 
December.
Explaining the reasons for the revocation of the licences, Baltic 
News Service said that the capital of LDB, Central Bank and the 
Liepaja and Alejas commercial banks was smaller than the minimum 
shareholding capital set out in banking legislation.  LDB, Liepaja 
and Alejas banks had also failed to observe the rules on short-term 
liquidity.  Lettika's licence was revoked because it had not 
undertaken the work required to put it finances in order after Bank 
of Latvia President, Einars Repse had banned it from performing any 
banking transactions with effect from 30th August of last year.

BROADCASTING & TELECOMMUNICATIONS -
Russia to draw more foreign investment into telecommunications 

Russia to draw more foreigin investments into telecommunications 
in 1996, Interfax news agency reported on 28th November, 
quoting Communications Minister, Vladimir Bulgak.
Bulgak said the emphasis would be on attracting major companies, 
which are expected to contribute 41.5 per cent of total investment.  
This year foreign businesses have invested US$520m in Russian 
telecommunications.  According to Bulgak, this shows that they regard 
the section as attractive.
The agency quoted Bulgak as saying foreign investment was 
particularly important now that government support for 
telecommunications had almost ceased.  Other sources of extra funding 
for the sector, the minister said, will include the circulation of 
"telephone bonds," a more effective tariff policy and the 
introduction of charges for local calls in 1996.

CREDIT & DEBIT - EBRD helps Russian-Spanish joint venture

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  (EBRD) will 
provide a US$11m (ECU9.1m) loan to the Russian-Spanish Joint venture 
AO Bashkortostan-Kelme.  The company is located in Meleuz (Repubic of 
Bashkortostan), Russian Federation, approximately 1,200-kilometres 
south-east of Moscow and 200km north of Ufa, reported a recent EBRD 
press release. 
AO Bashkortostan-Kelme will manufacture a large variety of high-
quality sports and leisure shoes, primarily for the Russian domestic 
market.  Given the strong historical tradition of the former Soviet 
Union in the area of athletics, the project sponsors expect the 
domestic market for such shoes to grow substantially over the coming 
years.  The joint venture will also manufacture all necessary 
components for the sports and leisure shoes and will assume the role 
of supplier of such components to the other Kelme joint venture in 
Eastern Europe (in Moldova and Belarus).
The joint venture will be equipped with modern shoe production 
equipment, sourced primarily from Spain, Italy and Japan.  EBRD 
financing will be used to a large extent for the acquisition of such 
equipment as well as for working capital purposes.  In addition to 
the technology transfer benefit associated with the project, over 700 
new skilled jobs will be created in the region of Bashkortostan over 
the next years.  The project is also expected to stimulate local 
suppliers of leather and other materials required for the production 
of shoes.  An additional beneficial effect for the country is the 
substitution of domestic production for hard currency imports. 
The loan has seven  years maturity including a grace period of 1.5 
years, and amounts to US$11 million.  Its spread is LIBOR-based plus 
a credit margin.
The project will be co-financed to the amount of US$11.4m by Banco 
Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Instituto de Crdito Official (IOC), with 
export credit coverage provided by Companola de Crdito a la Exportacion 
del Desarrollo (COFIDES), a Spanish governmental agency specialised 
in the promotion of Spanish investments abroad that will provide a 
subordinated loan to the joint venture.  For further information, 
please contact:  Rebecca Hill.  Tel:  +44 171 338 6255.

CREDIT & DEBIT - Spanish-Moldovan footwear joint venture

US$7.3m (ECU 6.0 million) loan will go to the Spanish-Moldovan joint 
venture, Ascom-Kelme S.A., to partially finance equipment and working 
capital needs for a shoe production facility in Orhei, Republic of 
Moldova, reported The European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development  (EBRD) on 31st October.  The creation of a local 
production and distribution capacity for high-quality sports and 
leisure shoes will serve the needs of the markets of Moldova, Russia 
and other countries of the former Soviet Union, and Romania.  Once 
full production capacity is reached, the joint venture will produce 
three million sports and leisure shoes per year.
The investment will create 1,200 jobs in a district with high 
unemployment and is expected to generate significant hard currency 
earnings for Moldova.  The joint venture will benefit from state-of 
the-art Western machinery and will have full technological and 
training support by the Spanish partner.  In addition the project is 
designed to rely primarily on production inputs from the Russian 
Federation and other countries of the former Soviet Union and is 
therefore expected to create significant backward linkages with 
suppliers of the shoes industry of the region, used to finance shoe 
production machinery and working capital needs.
Five years' maturity includes a grace period; interest on the US$7.3 
million loan is LIBOR-based plus a credit margin.  The project will 
be co-financed to the amount of US$7.2m (ECU5.9m) by Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya and Instituto de Crdito Official, with export coverage 
provided by Compania Espanola de Seguros de Crdito a la Exportacion. For

CREDIT & DEBIT - IMF grant extends US$48m loan

The board of the International Monetary Fund has approved an extended 
loan to Kyrgyzstan of US$48m within the framework of an agreed three-
year credit programme, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS reported 
from Washington.  The funds are being allocated to support a 
programme of economic and structural reforms being carried out by the 
Kyrgyz government.The three-year programme for Kyrgyzstan was 
approved by the IMF in May 1994 and originally provided for a total 
of US$105m.  However, taking account of the country's "considerable 
progress" in implanting reforms the Fund decided to increase the loan 
to US$131m.
The aim of the programme is to achieve by the end of 1996 a 2.5 per 
cent growth in GDP, a reduction in the annual rate of inflation to 15 
per cent and a cut in the budget deficit from the current 11.3 per 
cent of GDP to 5.5 per cent.

CURRENCIES -Fixed exchange rate band for Belarus

Belarus could introduce a fixed exchange rate band for its natural 
currency, the Belarusian rouble, in 1996,  Russian newspaper 
'Kommersant Daily' said on the 9th December, citing Tamara Vinnikava, 
chairman of Savings Bank - Belarusbank.
Vinnikava said all the necessary calculations had been completed and 
a draft presidential decree drawn up.  Many economists in the country 
support the introduction of the so-called "hard-currency corridor" as 
an alternative to a rapid devaluation of the Belarusian rouble.
According to Vinnikava, the lower limit of the fixed band is to be 
set initially at the current exchange rate of 11,000 Belarusian 
roubles to the dollar.

The right to manage a 5 per cent package of state-owned shares in

LUKoil itself and Bank Imperial, Interfax news agency reported, 
quoting the chairman of the State Committee for the Management of 
State Property and head of the commission organising the auction, 
Alfred Kokh.
The consortium offered the Russian government a loan of US$35.10m for

offered by rival bidder, the National Reserves Bank. Under the terms 
of the shares-for-loans auction, the winner is to pay off debts of up 
to R500bn run by the LUKoil subsidiaries.
LUKoil extracted 45.1m tonnes of crude oil in 1994 and refined 19.7m

Russia's Federal Property Fund has postponed the sale of 7.96 per 
cent of shares in the Yukos oil company to prevent its being 
overshadowed by the shares-for-loans auction and investment tender 
under which a 78 per cent holding in the company which was to be sold 
on 8th December, Interfax news agency reported.
A Yukos spokesman said that the decision had been made at the request 
of the company management, which was worried that shares might be 
undervalued if sold too soon after the larger block.  The cash 
auction is now likely to be held in the first quarter of 1996.
Under plans for privatising Yukos, 45 per cent of company shares are 
to remain state property for three years.  Investment bids will be 
invited for 33 per cent of shares on 8th December, at the same time 
as 78 per cent of state-owned shares are sold in a shares-for loans 
auction.  Of the remaining 22 per cent, 14 per cent are to be

According to Wolfensohn, reforms to be developed jointly with the 
Russian side in 1996-97 will aim to provide more social guarantees 
for miners, including retraining and employment of redundant workers.  
Before this, however, the Russian government should start a systemic 
transformation of the coal industry, reducing state subsidies, 
ensuring higher profits from coal production under market conditions 
and closing the most inefficient pits.

The World Bank has extended the term of its 1993 loan of US$168m to 
Russian oil company, Purneftegaz, to purchase oilfield equipment for 
another 12 months, Interfax news agency reported on 6th December,

The extension has been granted because Purneftegaz has so far

the summer, the company had to suspend the loan when duty exemptions 
initially envisaged in the agreement between the World Bank and the 
Russian government were abolished by the State Customs Committee.
Purneftegaz, a subsidiary of the Rosneft oil company, is developing 
the Gubinskoye, Severo-Tarasovskoye and Kharampurskoye oilfields in 
the north of Tyumen Region.  The company produced 8.5m tonnes of oil

ENERGY -Ukraine's gas debt to Russia threatens IMF loan

Ukraine risks promised International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds if it 
fails to pay US$92m of its gas debt to Russia for supplies in 1994, 
Russian Public TV reported on 6th December, quoting Ukrainian Deputy 
Finance Minister, Borys Sobolev.
The credit under threat is the next tranche of a multi-stage IMF 
loan.  The first stages have already been received by Ukraine and 
have been placed in the foreign currency reserves of the Bank of 
Ukraine, leaving the IMF "surprised" at the country's failure to pay 
the gas debt.  Ukraine's total gas debt to Russia now stands at 
US$240m.
The television report said Ukraine cannot pay off its external debt 
before its collects it internal debt.  In November the state gas 
supplier, Ukrgaz, cut off about 400 debtor enterprises, and a further 
300 will soon follow: this has not boosted income, but merely reduced 
expenditure.
Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister, Pavel Lazarenko was quoted as 
saying he hoped Ukraine would clear the debt by the start of the new 
year, repaying a quarter of the US$92m in raw materials and metals.
Failure to do so will result in the withholding of the IMF money.  
"Moreover, it is quite possible that the IMF will demand the result 
of its latest credit, as it was allocated, precisely to pay off the 
foreign debt for gas used in 1994," Lazarenko was quoted as saying.

STOCKS & SHARES - The state short-term bond market

The market for state securities is one of the most powerful non-
inflationary tools for financing the budget deficit, and the state 
pins serious hopes on it.  There are now more than 50 trillion 
roubles worth of state securities in circulation.  They are above all 
state short-term bonds (GKO).  These bonds are highly profitable, 
which is somewhat disquieting since the higher their profitability, 
the lower their reliability and vice versa, according to the laws of 
the securities markets in advanced countries, reports ECONews.
According to the 1996 draft budget, two-thirds of the 3.9 per cent 
deficit of the Gross Domestic Product will be covered by issuing 
domestic loans.  This will call for issuing and placing an even 
larger volume of GKOs, whose annual turnover on the state securities 
market has topped US$200m, or 3 times more than in the beginning of 
the year.
The high profitability of and, hence, the high demand for and high 
turnover of GKO securities has, on the one hand, led to the flow of 
investments and financial resources to the GKO sphere.  On the other 
hand, as the state lacks resources to buy out payment-due GKO bonds 
from previous issues, it has to direct towards these ends practically 
all the receipts from new state security tranches.  This was the case 
in September and October and may be replicated later on.  
Specialists view this way of combating inflation as another financial 
pyramid of the MMM type (MMM is a notorious company which engaged in 
this practice), though done at the initiative and on the scope of the 
state.  The GKO does not resolve the central issue, for which an 
entire mechanism of state securities was put in operation: state 
short-term bonds do not restrain, but instead spur inflation, 
believes Mikhail Delyagin, in charge of the group for economic 
problems of the Analytical Department under the President of the 
Russian Federation.

St Petersburg plans to issue bonds aimed at overseas investors for

denominated in roubles, in 1996.  The city recently received 
permission to issue bonds with a life of more than a year, which 
foreginers could buy.
It has already issued three, six and nine month bonds, worth US$370m, 
but they are only sold domestically because, under Russian law bonds 
with a life of less than a year cannot be converted into a foreign 
currency.
Emerging market fund managers say they would like to buy the short-
term municipal bonds and GKOs (Russian treasury bills), because of 
their very high yeilds, which average more than 100 per cent.
The fund managers went to the presentation hoping the St Petersburg 
short-term bonds would offer a loophole, allowing the repatriation of 
proceeds, one said.  He said the risk of a devaluation of the rouble 
made longer-term bonds unattractive.  "Eighteen months is a long time 
in Russia," he said. Political worries focus on parliamentary 
elections in December, in which  communists did well, and on the 
presidential election next June.
Fund managers will now wait in the hope that the Russian govenrment 
will relax its rules on repatriating funds some time next year, 
allowing foreigners into the short-term GKO and municipal bond 
markets.
St Petersburg needs the municipal bond funds to help with its budget 
deficit and to finance development projects.  Andrew Dobson, a 
consultant on Russian financial projects, said the city wanted to 
gauge Western investors' interest in longer-term bonds.
Leading bank plans big share issue
Shareholders in Gazbank, a leading commercial bank in Turkmenistan, 
have decided to increase its authorised capital from 25m to 100m 
manats by launching a second issue, Turkmen press agency reported on 
9th December.
The new 75m-manat issue is expected to be in the form of ordinary 
shares with a par value of 100,000 manats each.  The dividend 
forecast is for no less than 70 per cent per annum, the agency said, 
adding that applications to purchase over 70 per cent of the new 
shares had already been registered.  The Russian bank, Rossiyskiy 
Kredit, which already holds a 5 per cent stake in Gazbank's 
authorised capital, is among those interested in buying some of the 
new shares.
Gazbank's shareholders intend to increase its authorised capital 
further to 300m manats in 1996.  Foreign investors will be encouraged 
to acquire stakes, but the bank's Turkmen founders are to retain a 
controlling block of shares.
Gazbank issues short and medium-term credits to large private 
commercial structures in Turkmenistan, the agency recalled, adding 
that the proposed increase in the bank's authorised capital would 
enable it to "expand its lending volume significantly."

STOCKS & SHARES - Lithuania makes international debut in dollars

The Republic of Lithuania on 11th December made its international 
bond market debut, issuing US$60m of 10 per cent, two-year bonds via 
Nomura International.
"Our entry into the international capital markets provides valuable 
diversification of Lithuania's funding sources and confirms 
international confidence in the progress of Lithuania's rapid 
economic transformation," said Algimantas Krizinauskas, deputy 
minister for finance.
With the Litas, the national currency, pegged to the US dollar, the 
country's decision to tap the dollar sector seemed a natural one.  
Moreover, "the dollar market will provide them with the best 
opportunity to establish the name of Lithuania among a wide range of 
investors," said one banker.
At the re-offer price of 99.90, the bonds yield 444.8 basis points 
over the corresponding US Treasury note.  The proceeds will be used 
by Lithuania for general financing purposes.
The deal was said to have been heavily pre-marketed ahead of launch, 
and was reported to have met a good response, especially from 
emerging-market fund managers in the US.
LG Semicon, a South Korean semiconductor maker, issued US$100m of 
6.375 per cent five-year bonds yielding 80 basis points over the US 
benchmark at the 99.68 re-offer price.  The deal was also led by 
Nomura, which reported a positive response from fund managers in Asia 
and Europe, especially Germany.
The Republic of Colombia issued Y15bn of 3 per cent five-year bonds 
via Merill Lynch and Kokusai Europe.  Yielding about 100 basis points 
over yen Libor, the bonds were considerably more tightly priced than 
Colombia's recent D-Mark offering priced at around 170 basic points 
over Libor.
However, like other issuers in recent months, Colombia was able to 
exploit Japanese retail investors' hunger for assets that offer a 
significant yield pick-up over domestic products.  "Japanese retail 
investors don't look at comparative value - they just look for higher 
yields," said one dealer.
Crdit Local de France issued FFr5bn of four-year bonds via CDC and 
Socit Gnrale, yielding 20.5 basis points over the corresponding 
French government bond.

AUTOMOBILES & AVIATION -
Kamaz begins manufacture of clean engines

Russian heavy-truck maker, Kamaz, based in Naberezhnyye Chelny in the 
constituent republic of Tatarstan, has produced the first batch of a 
new series of ecologically-clean engines following modernisation of 
its engine plant, gutted by fire two years ago, ITAR-TASS news agency 
reported on 2nd December.
The fully upgraded plant is now making advanced engines for trucks 
and buses.  Three models received certification in September, 
confirming compliance with European rules on exhaust smoke density 
and toxicity.
Kamaz is to make 150 trucks fitted with the new engines by the end of 
the year.  In 1996, the company is to begin making 260 hp engines, 20 
hp more powerful than its prescent range.

AUTOMOBILES & AVIATION - GAZ lorry factory output up, new models planned

GAZ of Nizhniy Novgorod, arguably Russia's best-performing car and 
truck maker, has posted better output for almost all of its models in 
January-October 1995 and is scheduling the launch of a new range of 
Gazelle light truck modifications and negotiating joint manufacturing 
deals with foreign firms.
The company said it made 169,760 automobiles in January-October, 10.2 
per cent more than in the same period of last year, including 100,570 
cars (up 3.1 per cent) and 69,190 trucks (up 22.4 per cent).
GAZ has practially monoplised the Russian market for light urban 
trucks with its nippy Gazelle.  It turned out 48,346 of them in the 
first 10 months of this year, mostly the basic tarpaulin model.  It 
made 14,000 of the trucks from its launch to the end of 1994.  The 
company started making a whole-metal body modification on 15th 
December.  The company, meanwhile, last November struck a deal with 
the rest of Russia's main car and truck makers not to raise prices 
for at least three months.  GAZ has held its prices steady since 
August.
Geenadiy Suvorov, who advises the company's President Nikolay Pugin, 
said the company turned out its 15-millionth automobile on 4th 
December.  It was a six-seat Gazelle developed in conjunction with 
Sokol, a Nizhniy Novgorod fighter aircraft factory, as part of a 
local defence conversion programme, Nizhniy Novgorod Automobiles.
Executives from both Daewoo of South Korea and the Ford Motor Company 
of the US visited the plant in October for talks on possible 
manufacturing ventures.  Vladimir Churagev, GAZ's top manufacturing 
executive, held similar negotiations with BMW in Germany.  However, 
most manufacturers are only offering GAZ the right to make outdated 
models.  Talks, however, have made headway with Zahnrad Fabrik of 
Germany on a joint project to make five-gear transmissions.
GAZ in 1994 made 190,000 units, including 118,000 cars and 72,000 
trucks.
Orenburg defence factory to produce civilian helicopters
The Strela production  assocation, a former defence industry 
engineering works in the Urals town of Orenburg, is to start 
production of Kamov Ka-126 light helicopters for civilian use, the 
Economic News Agency reported on 6th December.
The helicopter is to be produced in two modifications, for cargo, 
with a maximum payload of 1,000kg, and for passengers, with a pod 
accommodating 6 people.  The company has already  received orders 
from several customers, including the Russian Ministry of Civil 
Defence, Emergencies and Natural Disasters. Israel, Taiwan and the 
Central Asian states have also expressed interest.

ECOLOGY - Pure water emerald

In the West, ecologically-clean products indicate that people care 
for their own health and seek a lifestyle to which food producers 
quickly react.  The latest fad is a litre of drinking water bought 
which costs US$1 at your local food stores.  It costs, doesn't it?  
It is nobody's secret that the quality of water in many Russian 
cities leaves much to be desired.  Foreign and Russian gadgets for 
household and neighbourhood water treatment are costly to use because 
their filters have to be replaced.  This is the explanation for the 
high cost of drinking water, reports Know-How from Russia/95 of RIA - 
Novosti.
The water treatment unit, Emerald, for household use, created by 
specialists at the Moscow-based scientific-technical joint venture 
which bears that name, is unprecedented, a forerunner of a world 
ecological revolution, specialists maintain.  Its operational 
principle is as simple as it is original.  Electrochemical activation 
occurs in a light plastic cylinder.  Anode oxidation destroys 
pathogenic micro-organisms.  Active chlorine compounds are decomposed 
and ions of heavy metals are restored on the cathode to become 
isolated in precipitation. Meanwhile, the water preserves the health 
valuable elements - fluorine, calcium and magnesium salts.  The pot 
in which such water is boiled accumulates no scale whatsoever.
Clinical tests show that Emerald-treated water improves immunity and 
makes people less prone to allergic diseases.  Especially in the case 
of kidney ailments.  its principle of operation can be used for 
disinfecting water in swimming pools and even municipal water 
treatment plants, replacing costly and environmently-hazardous 
chemical forms of treatment.
At the request of livestock breeders, experts from Emerald JV have 
also developed a method for raising calves, using water processed by 
their unit.  The method improves the stock, hence the beef quality.  
Ecologically-speaking, the beef is cleaner.
Most importantly, the new water-treatment method is economical.  No 
expendable materials are needed.  It calls for only electricity, 
though less than that used by an electric bulb, to produce up to 350 
litres of pure water ran hour.  That costs about 20 kopecks, instead 
of a dollar, per litre.

ENERGY - Subsoil nuclear power plant

Russia's Minatom (Ministry for Nuclear Energy), Goskomoboronprom 
(State Committee for the Defence Industry) and Mintopenergo (Ministry 
for Fuel and Energy) have brought their heads together to build the 
country's first Subterranean Atomic Heat and Electricity Station 
(PATES) in the Murmansk Region, reports Know-How from Russia/95 of 
RIA - Novosti.
The idea of building a subterranean nuclear power plant (PATES) was 
put forward in his time by Academician Andrei Sakharov.  Now it is 
implemented by the Academician A Krylov Central Research Institute.  
In a competition of small-capacity units for subsoil power facilities 
the well-reputed KLT-40 reactor used in nuclear-powered iceboats was 
picked out.
The capacity of the subterranean nuclear power plant will be 300 
megawatts (six 50-mWt units).  It is enough to supply heat and 
electricity for a large naval base, which is currently engaged in 
destroying nuclear-powered submarines under treaties on arms 
reduction.  The developers of the Shtokman natural gas field are also 
interested in the building of the station.  Gas will be pumped along 
ferroconcrete pipes, whose manufacture calls for heavy power inputs.
Is it really advantageous to build subterranean nuclear power 
stations?  Hard rocks protect not only against radiation but 
represent an exceptionally reliable envelope which can withstand 
loads by several degrees of ten larger than any ferroconcrete or 
metal structures.  Air-tight locking contraptions will ensure 
protection against possible external effects, including even acts of 
subversion.  Located underground, nuclear reactors call for less 
anti-seismic measures.
Specialists hope that the first step towards safe subsoil technology 
in nuclear electricity generation will be a success.
Nuclear submarine plant begins construction of drilling platform
A nuclear submarine plant in the northern Russian town of 
Severodvinsk has for the first time started the construction of an 
offshore oil drilling platform, ITAR-TASS news agency reported on 4th 
December, from Severodvinsk.
The plant, which builds nuclear-powered submarines for the Russian 
Navy, is expected to take several years to complete the project.  The 
platform, designed by specialists from St Petersburg and 
Severodvinsk, is to be used to develop an oilfield in the Arctic 
shelf of the Barents Sea, 60km from the shore.  The oilfield has 
estimated reserves exceeding 100m tonnes.
Lithuania installs new network of radiation monitoring stations
Danish experts have completed the assembly of an automated station to 
monitor gamma radiation at the Lithuanian Ministry of Environmental 
Protection in Vilnius, the Baltic News Service reported from the 
Lithuanian capital, on 28th November.
The construction of similar stations has began in the towns of 
Turmantas, Visaginas, Rimse and Gaide, all located "a dozen 
kilometres" from Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear power plant.  The 
agency quoted a press spokeman for the Ministry of Environment 
Protection as saying a network incorporating eight such stations was 
to be built in the country with Danish help, under an agreement 
between the Lithuanian ministry and Denmark's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Work on the project was started by Sweden and was later 
taken over by the Danes, BNS said.
Although minor accidents occur quite often at the Ignalina plant, 
official sources have always maintained that there have been no 
changes in background radiation around it.  The new network of 
monitoring stations, the agency said, would make it possible to 
observe any changes, discover their cause and issue prompt warnings 
to people in the country, to neighbouring states and to international 
organisations.  The main drawback of the existing radiation 
monitoring facilities, which include a small system inside the 
Ignalina plant, several automated monitoring points within 30km and 
equipment for measuring gamma radiation at various weather stations 
throughout Lithuania, is that information collected there cannot be 
conveyed promptly to any central control station, BNS said.

ENERGY - A warm future

Tartu in Estonia is being fast-forwarded to an environmentally 
friendly future by Western technology- and its residents are getting 
better heating systems for the long, cold winter into the 
bargain.Extensive programmes, to cut heat loss, reduce energy 
consumption and convert boilers from fossil fuel to bio-fuels mean 
the town has a cheaper cleaner, more efficient and more reliable 
heating system than before.
"We feel we have joined the 21st Century," says Enn Pernam, director 
of Tatu's Aardla boiler plant - new fed by wood chips instead of oil 
- after the inefficiencies and waste of the Soviet era.
Aardla is one of more than 40 Baltic regional projects relying on 
financial and technical assistance from Nutek, a Swedish public-
sector organisation promoting technology and energy efficiency.
Nutek's aim is to improve energy efficiency in Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania (and, to a more limited extent, Russia and Poland) by 
working with municipalities and local companies to convert boilers 
and improve heat distribution and building standards.
The idea is to try to bolster environmental protection by 
reconstructing boiler houses to operate wholly on local fuel, and 
reducing energy loss in residential houses and heating systems.
Other Western organisations involved in similar projects include the 
World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Among Swedish companies involved in the work, Energiakonsult has 
provided technical skills, and KMW Energi has supplied equipment.  
Local companies have participated in the reconstruction of the boiler 
houses.
The two sides have contrasting motives.  The Baltic states have an 
obvious financial interest in cheaper fuel after a surge in prices 
since their independence from the Soviet Union (where heating was 
supplied at completely uncommercial rates) four years ago.  An 
average Estonian can spend up to a third of his salary on heating.
The Swedes are more interested in helping the Baltic States cut their 
output of carbon dioxide as part of joint implementation 
arrangements, where one country can gain a credit for lowering the 
CO2 output of another.  Both sides seem to be achieving their 
objectives.  Using wood chips instead of oil has cut the fuel bills 
of some Baltic boiler plants by up to 50 per cent.
Pername says the Aardla conversion is cutting fuel costs by 2.1m Estonian 
crowns a year.  Nutek, meanwhile, says its projects will cut CO2 
production by as much as 250,000 tonnes a year, as well as reducing 
output of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide.
The main idea is to use the savings from lower fuel costs to repay 
the loans advanced by Nutek to finance the improvements. But that 
means that, initially at least, end-users are not generally getting 
lower heating bills.
"This is essentially a commercial operation," says Hans Nilsson, the 
head of Nutek's energy efficiency unit.  Loans are granted by Nutek 
to plant owners at Stockholm Interbank Offered Rates (currently about 
8.65 per cent) and are repayable over 10 years, with a two-year 
period of grace.  As security, Nutek gets guarantees from local 
municipalities and real estate as collateral.  In one case in Latvia, 
the security is a municipal cinema.
Where Nutek believes its concept scores is in the wider benefits it 
offers.  Residents might not be getting lower fuel bills, but they 
are getting better value for money - longer heating seasons, higher 
average room temperatures and hot water during summer.
Benefits also include reduced wastage, better heat regulation and 
heating systems that last longer.
"We are aiming for better all-round quality.  In the past, the way 
people cooled down was simply by opening the window," says Gudrun 
Knutsson, the programme's project leader.
Nutek's priorities are speed, affordability and reliability.  It 
emphasises simple, tried-and-tested technology and cuts through red 
tape by keeping involvement with national governments to a minimum.
It also provides a consultant to assist the local project leader with 
implementation.  Significantly, there is no "buy Swedish" 
requirements attached to the loans, which not only benefits other 
international suppliers but also companies in the Baltic region, 
where costs are lower.  Swedish companies are, nevertheless, winning 
a substantial number of contracts and are linking up with Baltic 
companies to boost business.
Nutek has committed Skr227.5m to its Baltic energy projects and has 
recently been promised a further SKr50m from the Swedish government.  
The idea is that, as loan and interest are repaid, funds are recycled 
to new projects.  However, Nutek does not expect to fully recoup its 
outlays, partly because its anticipates some defaults.
Not  everything has gone smoothly.  Some residents are not paying 
their fuel bills - because they are so high - meaning that plant 
owners are also finding the going tough.  There are also questions to 
access to wood chips and prices.  In Lithuania, for example, the 
state has a strong hand because it owns much of the forest.  Middle 
men have also tried to drive up prices by cornering supplies.  
Finally, there are continuing political and legal uncertainties which 
could undermine the value of the securities and guarantees pledged.
Nutek says its model works particularly well in Baltic states because 
they have already access to wood and a strong desire to be more self-
sufficient in energy and cut costly imports.  It works less well in 
Poland, which is keen to support a substantial domestic coal 
industry.
But the Swedish organisation is not discouraged.  Nilsson says there 
are many more projects needing to be financed.  Indeed, he is trying 
to promote a clearing house system that will bring potential 
financiers together with municipalities and local companies in 
Eastern Europe to drive the process further.

JANUARY 15, 1996

Russia rejoins the Space Race; Intersputnik

In the early 1980s, when the first European satellite 
televisionentrepreneurs wanted to show off the capabilities of their 
big, expensive dishes, as often as not they tuned into signals from a 
Russian Gorizont satellite; here was a technology which could leap 
the Iron Curtain and do no end of good for East-West relations.
Now, 15 years on, the Iron Curtain's gone, the Soviet empire has 
disintegrated, and those same Gorizonts are part of a large - if 
largely ageing - Russian satellite fleet which still plays a big role 
in the international broadcasting industry.  It may not be quite the 
leading role envisaged by those who saw a potentially world-beating 
space industry, liberated from the dead hand of Soviet bureaucracy.  
But the latest signals out of Moscow and St Petersburg suggest that, 
after five years of false dawns and unrealised dreams, a renaissance 
is at last under way.
This might surprise those Western operators whose belief in the 'new' 
Russia has been stretched by recent repeated launch delays and 
unexplained changes of plan, harking back to the worst days of the 
old regime.  Like every other sector in the Russian economy, the 
satellite industry has been hit by economic chaos, which is far from 
resolved; in some sectors, such as the TV industry, the point has 
been reached where some stations can't even pay their electricity 
bills for transmission.  The chief impact on the hybrid state/private 
sector satellite industry has been an inability to keep to its 
replacement (Express) satellite launch schedule - a vital process 
which virtually ground to a halt in early 1995, ostensibly as a 
direct result of the Rimsat debacle (see below).
And so, far from becoming a powerful rival to Western satellite 
operators, Russia has been losing clients to them, even those early 
'breakthrough' clients, CNNI and TV5.  A further blow was former 
Soviet republic Kazakhstan's recent decision to switch all TV 
distribution from Russian satellites to the Intelsats at 57 and 66 
degrees East.  This, according to Intelsat regional director CIS, 
Central and Eastern Europe, Yuli Wexler, was partly due to the ageing 
Russian fleet - "Their schedule for replacement has been falling 
behind," partly to Intelsat technical support services.  For similar 
reasons Intelsat has been picking up significantly more Russian  
business both in telecoms (it has recently set up its first intra-
Russian network with RussTelecom and Teleport TP) and in TV and SNG 
traffic --"TASS, for example, has become a large user of Intelsat 
globally."
Now, as so often in the past five years, the industry is making all 
the right noises about co-operation, openness and technological 
upgrading - but will it happen?
Two recent deals indicate that serious progress has been made in 
parts of the industry already.  SES's decision last year to use the 
Russo-American Lockheed-Krunichev-Energia International consortium to 
launch Astra 1F atop a Russian Proton rocket underlined the West's 
new-found confidence in Russian space technology.  A further boost 
came in July, when Eutelsat decided to order its first made-in-Russia 
spacecraft, SESAT, from manufacturer NPO-PM of Krasnoyarsk, again 
using Proton for its slated early 1998 launch.  The 18-transponder 
payload for this craft will, however, be built by Alcatel-Espace in 
France.  And Intelsat, which has yet to make direct use of Russian 
expertise, is looking closely at Proton:  "We've talked to the 
owners, seen the launches at Baikonur, and it's entirely possible 
that we can use it at some stage; we're not excluding the 
possibility," Wexler says.
But while the launch and construction side of the industry is alive 
and kicking, what of the long-awaited boom in attracting Russian 
satellite capacity?  Ironically, the very success of Proton could be 
affecting progress in this area:  "The elevation of launch costs is 
ripping the heart out of the industry," one foreign ex-client notes:  
"In 1992 a launch was under US$5m, now it's US$70m; it means they can 
no longer be so competitive."
Currently there are 17 geostationary Russian satellites providing 
feeds for broadcasters around the world - though the concentration of 
active orbital positions is in the Far Eastern and Central Asian 
regions contingent on former Soviet territories.  Between them, the 
elderly Gorizont and Radugas and the new Expresses are carrying 
customers as varied as Portugal's RTP Internacional, Business India 
TV and others - on top of their primary function of distributing 
television, radio, telephony and data services across the six times 
zones of the massive former Soviet empire.
In theory, the old Gorizonts are to be replaced by Express 
Satellites, the third of which is due for launch "early in 1996" to 
the popular 80 degrees East slot.  Although still some way behind the 
West in terms of payload (offering 12 transporters, 10 at C-Band and 
two Ku-Band) and longevity (five to seven years as against 10 to 12 
for US designs), Express is a much-needed enhancement of the Gorizont 
design, notably in having full north-south spin stabilisation.  The 
older satellites' notorious tendency to drift by as much as five 
degrees out of their nominal orbital position should become a thing 
of the past.
Unfortunately, as a spokesman for InformcosmosConsult, the legal and 
consulting agency for the Russian Space Agency confirms, the Gorizont 
replacement scheme was largely dependent on revenues from the now 
bankrupt Asia-Pacific satellite venture, Rimsat.  When Rimsat's 
payments stopped in 1994, the RSA provided "emergency funding" to 
complete the first Express, launched in October 1994.  Informcosmos 
says it is "doing its best trying to find funding for the Express 
programme... We hope it will be kept alive and we will have some 
successful launches in the future."
Financial problems have also plagued Russia's first DBS programme: 
the original 'Gelikon' scheme from 1989 proposed up to 10 satellites 
to cover the whole of the former USSR by 1995.  In fact it was not 
until 1994 that the first DBS satellite - Gals 1 - was launched, with 
a second to follow by the end of 1995.  The name 'Gelikon' seems to 
have been dropped: no domestic DBS customers have emerged, and two of 
the three high-power (90W/57dBW EIRP) Ku-Band transporters on Gals 1 
were leased to a Chinese broadcaster.  Gals was even moved 71 degrees 
East to serve this client's needs, but no regular services have been 
detected.  As for Gals 2, even an Intersputnik official responsible 
for marketing the capacity was unable to confirm its eventual orbital 
slot - "This has not yet been decided, it will depend on negotiations 
with users."
He adds that "some requests" had come from European broadcasters: one 
of the DBS slots to which the RSA has rights, 23 degrees East, would 
in theory allow a DTH service to dishes as small as 50cm in most of 
Europe.  Gals could also be used for digital services: the first 
tests using MPEG-2 signals on a Russian satellite were carried out 
successfully by the sixth channel of St Petersburg and the Scientific 
Research Institute for Television, Moscow last summer, using 
Scientific Atlanta encoding.  Should the Gals programme take off, 
more capacious, more powerful advanced Gals R designs are ready and 
waiting; on the other hand, observers of past Russian DBS schemes 
would advise against holding of breath.
At least three similar projects have come and gone within the past 
decade: after Gorizon there was the TRomantis' scheme, a Ku-Band 
joint Russian-German joint venture; this, like a C-Band co-operative 
venture with Canada, SovCanstar, came to nothing.  Then in 1993 there 
was GIS Globostar with its scheme to launch up to five 'Coupon' 
satellites offering massive datacoms capacity for Russian banks, and 
steerable, highly flexible Ku-F and spot-beams for any interested 
broadcasters across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  This, which 
would have been Russia's first privately-owned satellite system, was 
backed by banks which have since pulled back; and though the company 
still exists, the Coupons remain 'paper satellites' only.

The inside agent

For broadcasters outside the Russian Federation, the gateway to low-
cost capacity on Russian satellites is provided by Intersputnik, the 
Moscow based 22-nation satellite communications organisation which 
has handled the transition from state agency to outward-looking 
commercial operators more successfully than some.
Intersputnik - which its marketing manager, Hernedo Rodriguez, 
emphasises "is not a Russian organisation, but an international 
intergovernmental organisation" - goes to lengths to make the process 
as painless as possible for its customers, who are, of course, useful 
sources of hard currency.
According to Rodriguez, Intersputnik now handles five times the voice 
traffic it did in 1990, with a 30 per cent year-on-year growth during 
1995.  Television traffic, accounting for 80 per cent of 
Intersputnik's business, fared better still, with an 80 per cent 
growth in 1995.  Overall revenues were 40 per cent up this year as a 
result, he adds:  "We have more than 100 state and private companies 
as users, among them companies from the US, UK, Japan, Canada, 
France, Portugal, China, India, etc."
He cites Intersputnik's "democratic entry procedure and terms and 
conditions of operation, rather low tariffs, a simple and efficient 
system of mutual settlements," and "a sufficiently high percentage of 
the annual guaranteed profit share" as factors which have attracted 
many PTTs and broadcasters to join the group as either full members 
or users.
According to one former Western customer, Intersputnik can even be 
easier to deal with than some of its Western counterparts:  "It was 
pleasantly straightforward,"  says Jim Hodgetts of the Francophobe 
international broadcaster, TV5, which leased a transponder on the 
Statsionar 12 Gorizont in 1992 to reach the former French territories 
of southeast Asia.  "Each year we'd get their typed bill for 
US$1.25m, and so long as we kept paying, any problems we had we could 
put directly to their engineers - it was not at all politically 
secretive."
The give-away here, of course, is the price: as another Gorizont user 
puts it. "You get an awful lot of coverage for your money."  A berth 
on an Express or Gorizont at the most popular positions, 11/14 
degrees West and those around 80 degrees East, can take your signal 
to virtually the whole of the Third World and most of the First and 
Second World too, as Bombay/London-based Asian channel, Apna TV, has 
discovered to its advantage.  Apna is also breaking ground by taking 
the single Ku-Band transponder on the 11 degrees West Gorizont 26, 
giving it enough signal strength to market Apna and its add-on 
Sunrise TV as a DTH service to Asian viewers in the UK and northwest 
Europe, though viewers will need 1.2 metre dishes.One of 
Intersputnik's star European clients is RTP Interna ional, whose 
transponder on Express 2 at 14 degrees West gives it remarkably good 
coverage of territories in Africa and Latin America in one swoop:  
"It's a question of coverage," says Jos Banha Nunes of Marconi SA, 
Lisbon, lessee of space segment for the state broadcaster's 
international service, "but also a matter of price and power.  Using 
the global beam gives them coverage of all of Africa, as well as 
South America and East Coast USA markets.  Downlinks can use TVROs of 
2.5 metres in the islands off the African coast, and 3/4 metres 
elsewhere."
And, as Alexandre Fernandes, RTPi's international operations manager, 
adds, "This price is good - about half the price of the equivalent 
coverage by any other satellite, and the quality is good."  RTPi's 
Express signal is particularly in demand in the former Portuguese 
African colonies, with terrestrial relays, for example, in 
Mozambique, So Tom and the Cape Verde Islands.
No complaints, either, about drifting satellites - but as Hodgetts 
maintains, the Gorizonts' reputation for unreliability had been 
overplayed in the past, perhaps due to anti-Russian prejudice.  
"They're as good as anyone's, they might look primitive, but once 
they're up and made to work, they're very, very solid."
So why, after three years, did TV5 jump from Gorizont to Intelsat 
702?  "We were obliged to move because the new Express would not have 
covered the same area," Hodgetts says: and here he puts his finger on 
the real reason for Westerners' disinclination to use what for the 
most part are hugely cost-effective services:  "The satellites are 
operated to Russian criteria, for the benefit of Russian 
broadcasters."
Intersputnik, in fact, has at its disposal only a small, if 
strategically-important, part of the Russian fleet.  Currently, it 
controls 29 transponders on eight Gorizont and Express satellites in 
Indian and Atlantic Ocean slots, plus the Gals DBS capacity.  
Tariffs, Rodriguez says, are "lower than those offered by similar 
organisations," based on "world average prices," but also on occupied 
capacity rather than number of channels, with discounts for long 
leases. and "preferential tarrifs" for new services.
Back in 1993, Intersputnik's board voted to develop its own 
satellite, Intersputnik VIII, a 24-C-Band, 16-Ku-Band transponder 
craft which it intends to have in operation "1997-98."  With C-Band 
EIRPs of 37-40dBW, and Ku-Band powers of 48-53dBW, the new craft will 
allow use of much smaller dishes for both Earth station and DTH 
reception.  New Intersputnik orbital positions have also been 
notified to the ITU for co-ordination: 97, 83, 32, 23, 16, six and 
three degrees West; and 17, 27, 59, 64, 67, 75, 114 and 153 degrees 
East.
As Rodriguez points out, these "could be of interest for developing 
regional and global projects on a joint stake basis."
