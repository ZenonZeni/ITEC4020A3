<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During 1994, the Recreational Therapy department of Psychiatric Institute continued its work towards enabling the inpatients to attain more fulfilling and independent leisure lifestyles.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Therapeutic Recreation is the use of leisure services to improve or maintain physical, emotional, cognitive, and/or social functioning to assist patients in expressing independent leisure lifestyles. During this year, the staff of the department again functioned as active members of their respective interdisciplinary treatment teams. Their responsibilities included assessing patients' levels of leisure functioning, planning and implementing a variety of activities, charting patients' progress, participating in team meetings, maintaining their own level of professional preparedness, and contributing to the education and training of the many volunteers, students, new practitioners, and interns who come to the Institute. Recreational Therapy services were offered during days and evenings. The major focus of this treatment modality was activity groups, but individual attention was also provided, as appropriate.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Recreational Therapy department offered a weekly average of well over 40 regularly scheduled groups on the inpatient units, in addition to individual work with the patients, and special event programming. In all, the department provided almost 50 hours per week of group and individual service. Groups included sports and movement groups, crafts and hobby groups, and discussion groups.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1994 was an active period of personnel change within the department. Kay Gimmestad resigned from her position as half-time Recreation Therapist on the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Johnny Lopez, C.T.R.S., and Robert Goldstein, C.T.R.S., were hired to provide evening and weekend programming. Leon Sanders resigned his position as Senior Recreation Therapist within the Washington Heights Community Service, to accept a similar position at another OMH facility. Wendi Hapke, C.T.R.S. was hired as a Recreation Therapist on the Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit. Lori Alpert, C.T.R.S. was hired as a Senior Recreation Therapist on the WHCS-lntensive Care Unit. Patricia Smith was promoted to a Senior Recreation Therapist position and was named Assistant Director of the department as she continued her work on the General Clinical Research Service.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Special Event Programming also figured prominently in the department's service during the summer. Included were trips, barbecues on the Porch, and a softball game and picnic. During National Therapeutic Recreation Week in July, department members joined their colleagues within the Therapeutic Recreation department at Presbyterian Hospital for a softball game against local radio station WMXV to raise funds for the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) Neighborhood Fund.

Again meeting its responsibility to the community at large, the medical center, and to the staff of the Institute, the department made the gym available to the Audubon O.P.D., Neuro 12 and Eye 6, the Presbyterian Hospital Employees' Recreation Association, a community-based Karate Club, an Exercise Class for staff, and a staff basketball group.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Department members improved their own clinical skills by attending professional conferences and workshops, such as the Mid-Eastern Symposium on Therapeutic Recreation, the Therapeutic Recreation Forum, and the Annual Conference sponsored by the American Therapeutic Recreation Association. Matt Gold continued teaching Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation this year, as one of the Institute's American Heart Association C.P.R. instructors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mr. Gold continued his active involvement in professional organizations, and helped form the New York State Therapeutic Recreation Association, representing Therapeutic Recreation professionals within New York State. He serves as this organization's Treasurer.
