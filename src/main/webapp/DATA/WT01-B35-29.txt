<h3>Antibiotic Activity Of An Extract Of Peyote</h3>

<hr>

<p> The use of peyote in religious rites by many Indian tribes is
common knowledge. In addition, curative properties for such
varied ailments as toothache, pain in childbirth, fever, breast
pain, skin diseases, rheumatism, diabetes, colds, and blindness,
among other things, have been claimed for this plant by the same
peoples...The U.S. DISPENSATORY lists peyote under the name <i>Anhalonium</i>
and indicates its use to some extent in various forms for
neurasthenia and hysteria and also in cases of asthma... </p>

<p> Extracts of whole peyote plants were prepared in various
solvents and screened for antimicrobial activity...and showed
positive microbial inhibition...the principle antibiotic
substance was given the name <i>Peyocactin.</i> </p>

<p> Swiss-Webster white mice were used for preliminary animal
toxicity tests and protection studies to indicate the degree of
inhibitory action of peocactin against fatal staphylococcal
infection. In every case the protected animals survived while
those in the control group succumbed within 60 hours after
infection with <i>S. aureus...</i> Summary: A water-soluble
crystalline substance separated from an ethanol extract of <i>Lophophora
williamsii...</i> exhibited antibiotic activity against a wide
spectrum of bacteria and a species of the imperfect fungi...Of
particular interest was its inhibitory action against 18 strains
of penicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus.</i> </p>
