 <H3> WARRIOR BONUS POOL</H3>
2% of Company's monthly sales is in this pool.<BR>
Any Platinum Warrior who is fully blocked from<BR>
any 1 leg of Infinity Bonus by downline, qualifies for<BR>
this pool.  This pool divided pro-rata by those who qualify.<BR>
 
<P>The first level in our program is the Wholesale Associate where you can retail product and sponsor a small 
network of distributor/ consumers.  As a Wholesale Associate with $50 PV (personal volume), you may qualify to receive 10% of BV (bonus volume) on the purchases made by the people you directly sponsor into RBE.  The next position is that of Ambassador where you begin building other leadership skills within your group by assisting your downline to build a second level of participants, and chart a course for their own success.  With a $100 PV (personal volume), you may now qualify for the 3 Star Ambassador level of achievement by creating 3 active legs of Ambassadors and earn 10% BV on everyone through 3 levels.  By adding one more active leg to your organization for a total of 4, you will become a 4 Star Ambassador and earn 10% through 4 levels of sponsorship.  By adding a fifth active leg, you will be promoted to the position of 5 Star Ambassador and earn a 5th level of 10% BV.</P>
<P>Once you have earned the position of 5 Star Ambassador, you now qualify for one of the most exciting and profitable compensation concepts offered in the Network Marketing industry.  When you understand the profit potential at this level, you will want to obtain this position as quickly as is humanly possible.</P>
<H3>THE WARRIOR INFINITY BONUS</H3>
<P>The Warrior Infinity Bonus is designed to give extraordinary rewards to extraordinary leadership performance.  This bonus gives 5 Star Ambassadors the potential of earning a percentage on their organization from the 6th level down, regardless of depth.  The Infinity Bonus is paid in addition to the 5 level bonuses.  This bonus is paid on all legs and interrupted only by other downline Ambassador qualified for the Warrior Infinity Bonus on a specific leg.  When that happens, the higher degree Ambassador still receives the difference between their bonus percentage.  Look at the profit plan diagram and you will see that you can qualify for an additional 1%, 3%, 5%, or up to 8% of BV on your organization from the 6th level down.  That simply means you could earn up to as much as 10% on your first five levels and up to 8% on the 6th level down to infinity.</P>
<H3>WARRIOR BONUS POOL</H3>
<P>The Warrior Bonus Pool is 2% of the company's total monthly sales.  Any month a qualified Platinum Warrior also has a qualified Platinum Warrior in his downline, he qualifies for this fund.  The fund is divided Pro-rata.</P>
