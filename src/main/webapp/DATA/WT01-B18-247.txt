                       RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR REMAND  


     I, Carl Eric Olsen, petitioner in the above-captioned petition for 

review of a final administrative order, hereby respond to the 

respondent's Motion for Remand to the Administrator of the Drug 

Enforcement Administration, and state as follows:  

     1.   On September 6, 1992, I filed a petition with the Administrator 

requesting that marijuana be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II 

of the Controlled Substances Act.  In support of this petition, I filed a 

statement of grounds for rescheduling in compliance with 21 C.F.R. &#167; 

1308.44(b)(B).  

     2.   On October 23, 1992, the Administrator responded by refusing to 

accept my petition for filing and by ruling on its merits.  Contrary to 

what the respondent says in paragraph two of the Motion for Remand, the 

Administrator did review the grounds upon which I relied and did make a 

ruling on the merits of my petition.

     3.   Pursuant to the 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.44(c), respondent is required 

to accept a petition for filing absent some defect in format.  As the 

respondent now admits, this requirement was not met, and respondent now 

claims it is requesting this Court to remand the matter so that it may 

accept my petition for filing in accordance with regulations.  However, 

since the respondent ruled on the merits of my petition, it is 

questionable whether the respondent actually refused to accept my petition 

for filing.  

     4.   Respondent claims to make the Motion for Remand in the interests 

of fairness and judicial economy and not with the intent of causing 

unnecessary delay.  However, the respondent fails to mention that the Drug 

Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been developing a pattern of 

unfairness, waste of judicial resources and unnecessary delay.  The 

respondent mentions one example in the Motion for Remand, NORML v. 

Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974), but fails to mention another 

case where a petition was not accepted for filing, Carl Eric Olsen v. 

Drug Enforcement Administration, 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir 1989).  Between 

1983 and 1985, I filed several petitions which the DEA refused to accept, 

until a mandamus action was filed in the U.S. District Court.  Id. 878 

F.2d at 1459.  Then, after review of the DEA's denial of the petition on 

its merits was sought, the DEA asked this Court &quot;to remand the matter for 

renewed agency consideration.&quot;  Id. 878 F.2d at 1460.  This is exactly 

what the DEA is doing now.  

     5.   Since the DEA has already ruled on the merits of my petition, 

the only possible reason for a remand would be because the DEA didn't make 

a reasonable decision on the merits of my petition and now wants to hold 

an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge to correct 

its error.  If the DEA simply plans to deny the petition again after it is 

accepted for filing, then there is no reason for a remand, because a final 

ruling has already been made and such a remand would simply be a waste of 

judicial resources and an unnecessary delay.  

     6.   Respondent now requests this Court to order the Administrator 

upon remand to accept my petition for filing and to make a ruling upon the 

matter within 90 days of the date of this Court's final order in the 

related cases of Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement 

Administration, No. 92-1168 and Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement 

Administration, No. 92-1179.  Both of these cases are scheduled for oral 

argument on October 1, 1993.  I strongly oppose my case being delayed for 

these two cases.  The grounds upon which I seek rescheduling are entirely 

unrelated to the grounds relied upon in these two cases, and, if this 

Court decides to remand this matter, I think this Court should set a time 

frame that is unrelated to them.  

     Respectfully submitted,  

     Carl E. Olsen, pro se  
     Post Office Box 4091  
     Des Moines, Iowa 50333

September 19, 1993
