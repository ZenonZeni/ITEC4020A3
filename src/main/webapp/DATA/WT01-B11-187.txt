<B>Illegal To Buy Or Sell Spawn<BR> 
From Angler-Caught Fish



</B>

</CENTER><P>
Under an amendment to the <I>Game and Fish Act</I>, anglers who fish anywhere in Ontario are prohibited from selling the spawn of fish caught.  It is also illegal for anyone, including baitfish dealers, to purchase spawn from anglers. <P>

The amendment to Section 72, which took effect January 1, 1996, states that: "Except under the authority of a licence and in accordance with the regulations, no person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase, barter, culture or be concerned in the sale, purchase, barter or culture of fish other than species designated in the regulation."<P>

Fish spawn can only be sold by a licensed aquaculturist.  Bait fish dealers can purchase spawn from licensed aquaculturalists for resale to anglers.<P>

This new regulation will protect natural fish populations in Ontario's lakes and rivers by prohibiting anglers from harvesting fish for commercial gain.<P>
