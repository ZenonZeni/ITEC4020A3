<H1 align=center>SCUTTLED FLEET<BR>
of SCAPA FLOW<BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>By Bernie Chowdhury 1995</FONT></H1>
<H5>NOTE: A version of this article appeared in Underwater USA's Wreck Diver Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 10.</H5>
<P>Scapa Flow is a place with which most Americans are not familiar, yet it is Europe's most popular wreck diving destination.  Recreational diving charter services in Scapa started in 1980.  Since that time, groups from throughout Europe and North America have ventured here.  Located in the scenic Orkney Islands, off Scotland's north coast, Scapa Flow is a natural, deep-water harbor.  The "Flow" offers excellent diving and is unique to history.  It was here that 74  interned warships of the German High Seas Fleet scuttled themselves shortly after the First World War.  This act is unparalleled in history.  Seven major vessels from the High Seas Fleet remain on the bottom and provide divers a rare glimpse into a past age.  Other wrecks from the two World Wars abound, marine life is plentiful and visibility up to 100 feet can be enjoyed.
<P>The place referred to as "Orkney" by natives is an archipelago of about 70 islands, 20 of which are inhabited by humans.  Seals, over 300 bird species and other wildlife claim the majority of Orkney's islands as theirs exclusively.  Historic, accessible monuments dating back 6,000 years chronicle man's habitation of the Orkney Islands.  Although many visitors come to this starkly beautiful and wind-swept place to view the plentiful wildlife and historic monuments, most divers are initially attracted by the remains of the Kaiser's High Seas Fleet.
<P>The size and profiles of the Fleet wrecks makes an immediate impression on the diver.  Each of the wrecks can be dived within accepted U.S. and British Recreational depth limits.  Nowhere else is there such a proliferation of easily assessable warships within recreational depths available to the diver.
<P>How did these great warships that once challenged Britain's supremacy of the seas end up on the sea floor of the British Royal Navy's deep-water anchorage?  In November, 1918, under the Armistice ending hostilities of "The Great War" (which later came to be called World War I), Germany agreed to let her powerful navy be guarded by the allies.  A total of 74 ships were called upon to be voluntarily interned under the watchful eyes of the British at Scapa Flow.  Many of the vessels that went to Scapa were considered some of the finest warships of the day.  Many also participated in the Battle of Jutland, off the Danish coast, which was the only major naval engagement of the Great War.  (Note that the Germans refer to this clash of warships as the Battle of Skagerrak.)  This once proud navy now disarmed its powerful guns and sent its vessels packing to Scotland with only skeleton crews to man them.  Seven months dragged on, and the Peace Treaty negotiations seemed to be deadlocked.  Great Britain and her allies, including the United States, threatened to resume hostilities if the Germans did not sign on the dotted line.  Admiral Reuter, the German in charge of the interned Fleet,decided to order the sinking of his ships rather than have them fall into the hands of the British.  On June 21, 1919, after the Royal Navy left the Flow for exercises, the order was given to scuttle the High Seas Fleet.
<P>The British Navy were informed about what was going on and rushed back to Scapa.  They prevented several vessels from sinking:  out of 74 ships, only 52 made it to the bottom.
<P>During the British attempt to prevent the German ships from sinking, nine German sailors were shot and killed and many others wounded for refusing British orders to stop the sinking of the German High Seas Fleet.  Then began the most extensive marine salvage operation ever conducted.  The British Admiralty sold the hulks that once represented the pride of the German Navy to salvage companies.  From 1922 to 1946, a total of 42 ships were successfully raised and sold for scrap.
<P>So what is left of the German Fleet?  Three 26,000 ton battleships, Konig, Kronprinz Wilhelm and Markgraf and four 4,000 to 5,000 ton light cruisers, Brummer, Dresden, Koln and Karlsruhe remain.  Three smaller Fleet vessels, the S-36, the S-54 and the V-83, torpedo boat destroyers, also remain.  Note that the deepest wreck, Markgraf, is in 150 feet of water, but comes up to about 66 feet. Also note that the Markgraf's captain, Lt.-Commander Walther Shumann, was one of the nine German sailors shot and killed by the British during the scuttling.  (Although U.S. Recreational agencies limit recreational diving to 130 feet, the major British training agency, the British Sub-Aqua Club, or BS-AC, sanctions recreational diving to 50 meters/165 feet and does allow for limited decompression.)  All the other wrecks are in waters no deeper than 120 feet, and all have huge profiles, allowing for true multi-level diving and reasonable bottom times.
<P>A typical diving day will start with a hearty Scottish breakfast, which may include eggs, bacon or ham, toast, tea or coffee, fruit, juices, porridge, or cereal.  At 9:30 A.M., the dive boat departs from the town of Stromness.  A leisurely one-hour boat ride takes the dives to the German wrecks.  Boat diving practices in the United Kingdom (U.K.) differ from those in the U.S. In the U.K., dive boats do not anchor into wrecks.  They prefer to stay unattached in the event a diver needs assistance, in which case the boat is free to pick the diver up.  To start the dive, the captain, or skipper as they prefer to be called in the U.K., will maneuver his boat to a down line attached to the wreck and marked with a buoy.  The divers will then enter the water one buddy team at a time, swim the few kicks to the down line and then descend, preferably without hauling themselves down the line.  When their dive is over, the divers may either ascend with the down line as their reference, or use a lift bag attached to a reel.  When the team surfaces, the skipper will bring the boat around so that the divers have an easy swim to the ladder.  These practices will be familiar to anyone having done boat based drift diving, which is particularly popular in Cozumel, Mexico.
<P>The vast size of the largely intact wrecks is sure to awe even the most experienced wreck diver.  The light cruisers all lay on their sides, while the battleships are up-side-down, otherwise known as "turtle."  With visibility on the German wrecks ranging from 20 to 70 feet, the structures can be clearly discerned by anyone who has either studied drawings of the German wrecks or is familiar with warships.  Some very good drawings of the Fleet wrecks can be seen in Rod Macdonald's book Dive Scapa Flow.  (Mainstream Publishing Company (Edinburgh) LTD, 7 Albany Street, Edinburgh EH1 3UG, Scotland.)
<P>Through the years, the ships have been subject to salver's blasts and also to the ravages of salt water submersion.  Large holes appear everywhere.  Long and fairly unobstructed passageways abound on the light cruisers.  A word of caution:  any overhead environment requires special training, equipment, and skills to safely explore.  At the very least, divers contemplating entering a wreck should be trained in wreck diving, have a completely redundant air source, and a guideline.  Also important is the use of anti-silt techniques:  the silt is very fine on the wrecks and careless fin strokes or other movements quickly reduce the viz to zero.
<P>Life is everywhere on the wrecks at Scapa.  Anemone, dead man's fingers, mussels, scallops, crabs, lobster, fish and occasionally seals can be seen.  Life is even more pronounced on the shallow blockships.  These ships were sunk as obstacles to prevent the Germans from entering Scapa in submarines and sinking British ships.  Although the blockships now provide breathtaking views both above and under water, they once performed a vital function.  
<P>Unfortunately, in September of 1939, the blockships from the First World War had either fallen apart or shifted in the strong currents and winter storms.  In what some people call the most daring naval act of World War II, the U-47, a small German submarine, known as a U-boat and commanded by Gunther Prien, slipped into the Flow and sank the flagship of the Northern  British Navy, the Royal Oak, with the loss of over 800 men.  (In many respects, the Royal Oak is the British equivalent of the U.S.S. Arizona, which was sunk during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941.)
<P>After the tragedy of the Royal Oak, more blockships were sunk and today these wrecks offer exciting and picturesque shallow dives.  Photographers and videographers will delight at the 70 to 100 foot visibility on blockships.  All divers will appreciate the kelp fronds and friendly fish that come around waiting to be fed.  On occasion, some of the many seals that inhabit Orkney will venture to swim near divers, though the seals are very shy.  To get close to these creatures requires patience.  Frequently, divers choose to snorkel with the seals between wreck dives.
<P>Today, Mad Dog Expeditions runs diving trips to Scapa Flow and offers training at all levels.  It is possible to conduct wreck diving training all the way through NITROX (oxygen enriched air) and TRIMIX (oxygen, helium, nitrogen) training, complete with internationally recognized certification.
