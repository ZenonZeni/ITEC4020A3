<p><strong>LOS ANGELES</strong> - The upset victory of Loretta Sanchez in 
California's 46th Congressional District has shaken the 
Republican Party establishment to its core. The defeat of 
nine-term Congressman Bob Dornan signals a historic turn 
away from right-wing politics in Orange County, a 
nationally-recognized citadel of conservatism.</p>

<p>Sanchez, a Mexican American, becomes the first Latino and 
first woman elected to Congress from Orange County. The fact 
that she is the daughter of Mexican immigrants and trade 
unionists makes the victory against Dornan, who is viciously 
anti-woman, anti-immigrant and anti-labor, even sweeter.</p>

<p>Sanchez was not intimidated by Dornan's tenure or his crass 
attacks against her. From the outset, she ran to win. A 
tactical decision to spend $100,000 for television and radio 
ads early in the campaign was successful in bringing in a 
flood of contributions and support.</p>

<p>Her campaign for jobs, a woman's right to choose, 
affirmative action and gun control stood in stark contrast 
to the bombastic Bob, whose approval rating in the polls 
sunk to 40 percent.</p>

<p>Ray Cordova, regional director of the Democratic Party in 
Orange County and a key figure in the Sanchez campaign, told 
the World that the Sanchez victory was due in the first 
place to a historic turnout by Mexican American and Latino 
voters. While over half the district is Latino, it has not 
been a decisive factor until now. Citizenship campaigns and 
voter registration drives were crucial to Sanchez' success.</p>

<p>Cordova, who is also a leader in the Communication Workers 
of America, emphasized the "tremendous role played by labor" 
in the 46th CD, one of the seven targeted Southern 
California races. He described the grassroots organizing 
that took place during the campaign.</p>

<p>Monday Night Football mobilizations took place at the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall in 
Santa Ana, the largest city in the district. Unionists - 300 
strong - would meet to watch football, work on election 
mailings and posters and do whatever other work needed to be 
done for the candidates challenging the county's GOP. "The 
labor movement," Cordova said, "successfully adopted both 
the labor-to-labor and labor-to-neighbor strategies in the 
district."</p>

<p>Sanchez also mobilized the traditionally conservative 
Vietnamese community and, to the surprise of many, won their 
support and votes. Republican presidential candidate Bob 
Dole won the county only narrowly although in the past 
Orange County residents have voted overwhelmingly Republican 
in the presidential election.</p>

<p>The Sanchez campaign estimates that women voters turned out 
big for her. She also received the votes of many whites and 
Republicans. Dornan's brand of right-wing extremism turned 
off these Republican voters, especially pro-choice 
Republican women. Committees such as Republicans for Sanchez 
were organized for the election.</p>

<p>Ellen Padberg, a Republican political consultant from Orange 
County, wrote in the L. A. Times, "It will be poetic justice 
when a Latina sends Dornan to the unemployment office. 
Loretta Sanchez has everything that Bob Dornan can't stand 
in women - brains, courage, integrity and tenacity. 
Republicans and Democrats, men and women across the country 
will all raise a toast to Sanchez. She busted the bully."</p>

<p>Dornan has a history of slanderous attacks against his 
political opponents. While Democrats are his main target, 
when Dornan defeated Judy Ryan, a judge, in the 1992 
Republican primary he used racist and sexist terms to refer 
to her supporters.</p>

<p>In his early years, right-wing Hollywood figures such as 
Ronald Reagan, John Wayne and Bob Hope gave Dornan his 
springboard into politics. They considered him their "great 
right hope." He has been the leading voice in Congress for a 
military buildup, winning him the nickname of "B-1 Bob." He 
has received funds from right-wing groups throughout the 
country, at one time receiving more money than any other 
candidate for Congress.</p>

<p>A long-time friend of George Bush, Dornan developed the 
"Moscow strategy" for the 1992 presidential race. This was a 
last-ditch effort to paint Bill Clinton as a "traitor" for 
having visited the Soviet Union as a tourist during the days 
of the Vietnam War. Dornan said Clinton "went to the enemy 
heartland under the shadow of the Kremlin to be used by 
enemy forces" so he could "lick the boots of the Communist 
killers."</p>

<p>No other member of Congress has matched the venom spewed by 
Dornan. He has been a vile, publicity-seeking frontman for 
the ultra-right for all his 18 years in the House of 
Representatives. He was a harbinger of the ultra-right 
takeover of the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Dornan represents the worst and most dangerous fascist 
forces in our country. For this reason many are celebrating 
his defeat. A number of other races in the 46th CD reflected 
the new political realities. The most important was the 
strong campaign run by Lou Correa, a Mexican American, who 
lost his bid for the 69th Assembly District by only several 
hundred votes. His grassroots campaign was supported by 
labor and helped mobilize many Latinos who provided the 
margin of victory for Sanchez. Nativo Lopez, a leader of 
Hermandad Mexicana, an immigrants rights organization, won 
against Christian Coalition politics for a seat on the Santa 
Ana School Board.</p>

<p>At press time, Dornan was claiming that his loss was due to 
a massive case of "voter fraud" and the votes of non-
citizens. As usual, he is stooping to the lowest common 
denominator to try to win. While all the votes are still not 
counted, most are and Sanchez is still winning by 600 votes. 
Dornan's time is up.</p>
