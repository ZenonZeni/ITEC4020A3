<P><IMG hspace=10 align=right width=107 height=147 SRC="image/smith.gif" ALT="sarah smith">

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Boston author <B>Sarah Smith</B> (pictured holding book) paid a visit to <B>A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books</B> in San Francisco to celebrate the publication of her novel "The Knowledge of Water" (Ballantine). A period mystery, the book takes place in the Paris of 1910, when a torrential flood ravages the city. The San Francisco store created a special window display around the book utilizing a 3-D puzzle of the Eiffel Tower. Pictured with the author is bookseller <B>Christy Pascoe</B>, whose enthuisiastic handselling of Smith's earlier paperback, "The Vanished Child" (Ballantine), made industry news last year. Pascoe and A Clean Well-Lighted Place have sold nearly 3000 copies of "The Vanished Child," making it the bestselling book in the store's history.

<P><IMG hspace=10 align=left SRC="image/bk_pass.gif" width=268 height=70 ALT="book passage">

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> <B>Book Passage</B> in Corte Madera was involved in a sting operation that led to the arrests of a bookstore owner and an alleged supplier of stolen books. According to published reports, police say the two suspects have been part of a stolen book ring operating in the Bay Area for 10 years. After suffering substantial shoplifting losses, Book Passage hired an undercover police officer to moniter the store. The off-duty officer caught a shoplifter who provided information pointing toward a book theft ring. The Corte Madera and San Francisco police departments then launched a criminal investigation using books supplied by the Corte Madera store. Police eventually arrested two men after one was allegedly observed selling stolen books to the other. Investigators recovered numerous boxes of books they suspected were stolen, including the books provided by Book Passage.
