New Life for a Used Plating Line
</H1>

Uniting used equipment and new technologies provided 
Rawac with the perfect plating line...<P>

<P>Rawac Plating Co., Springfield, Ohio, bought a used plating 
machine and gave it new life. With the help of its next door neighbor, Corrotec, 
Inc., Rawac was able to resurrect the giant machine and make it a first class 
zinc plating line.
<P>It all started when Dave Stratton of Corrotec called Dave Fail of Rawac 
and asked if he would be interested in a used plating line. Considering 
that several competing businesses in the Springfield area were leaving or 
closing, Mr. Fail and his boss, Art Gianakopoulos, decided it would be a 
good investment. However, simply moving the line into the building was not 
the answer. Rawac had to build an addition to its existing facility to 
accommodate the new line. 
<P>This allowed Corrotec to assist in the setup and layout of the new 
building, as well as make recommendations about the floor, dikes, secondary 
containment and waste treatment facilities. 
<P>The line became a marriage of old and new. The used line was coupled 
with new programming, heaters, rectifiers, washer, dryer and conveyor line. 
A prewash system was added also to the line to help remove the variety of 
oils and soils that come in on parts. 
<P>&quot;Each manufacturer uses a different oil, it seems,&quot; noted Mr. Fail. 
&quot;We needed something that would work with all types of soils.&quot; Job shops 
are being confronted with more and different types of soils. There are 
several theories as to why parts are arriving at job shops with more oils and/or 
soils on them. One theory is that the demise of vapor degreasing has 
prompted manufacturers to send dirty parts to the plater for cleanup. Another theory 
is that manufacturers are changing the oils they use due to 
environmental regulations. Since there is an array of machining fluids, lubricants and 
oils, the plater has to find a way to clean all of them off the parts. 
<P>The prewash system at Rawac is a single-stage process in which parts 
are impinged with a low concentration (four oz/gal) alkaline cleaner for 
three min. A gas-fired immersion burner heats the cleaner. Two vertical 
pumps, producing 150 gph at 60 tdh, pump the solution through risers to 
nozzles, where parts are sprayed at 300 gpm. This removes 90 pct of all soils 
before the parts ever reach the cleaners on the zinc plating line. It also keeps 
the zinc plating baths clean, allowing one to see clear to the bottom of the tank. 
<P>The prewash system was a solution to problems Rawac had experienced 
on its other plating lines. The oils from incoming parts were killing the 
immersion cleaners and, subsequently, additional waste treatment and 
greater chemical use resulted. There was also added downtime for dumping 
the cleaner tanks and recharging them with fresh cleaner. 
<P>The prewash is off-line yet set up adjacent to the plating line. After 
the loader removes two racks from the plating line it loads two racks from 
the washer onto the line. 
<P>The original plating system was designed to plate different size parts 
than those plated at Rawac. Corrotec rebuilt the load bars to accommodate 
new parts and heavier racks. All the system controls were converted into 
programmable logic controls. The system runs from a PLC-basic control system 
with operator interface. A similar return-type machine was already running at 
the Rawac facility and was used as the foundation for the new system. 
<P>The plating line has 44 stations and handles 88 racks at a time. Cycling 
is just over one min per cycle, producing two racks of parts or 120 racks/hr 
of plated parts. The plating cycle is listed in Table I. 
<P>All rinses, except those between the soak and electrocleaner, are 
countercurrent. In the cleaning tanks, cleaners are pumped from the bottom of 
the tank and through a ripple pipe to skim off the oils. The recovered oils are 
sent to a reclaimer. 
<P>The last rinse in each countercurrent rinse sequence has a flow 
restriction of five gpm. The total rinse water discharged from the plating line is less than 25 gpm. 
<P>Water from the line is collected in a large sump and from there is 
transferred to a sump in the main building. The main building houses an 
expanded 150 gpm waste treatment system. 
<P>When Rawac decided to install the zinc plating line, it knew it would 
have to also consider a larger waste treatment system. First, Rawac purchased 
a larger clarifier from Lanco Environmental Products. The treatment 
reactors also were enlarged. The reactor system consists of a series of tanks 
that elevate the pH to approximately 10, doses it with chemicals and 
polymers, sends it to the surge tank and then to the clarifier. From the clarifier, 
wastewater goes through a sludge thickener followed by a filter press for 
dewatering. Clarified liquid goes to a weir tank and is then discharged to the local 
POTW. The limit on zinc in Springfield is three ppm. 
<P>The ventilation system is a 18,500 cfm Duall System scrubber. The 
hoods and ductwork were rebuilt, along with a new remote recirculating tank 
and piping.
<P>The marriage of used equipment with new was an accomplishment. 
But Rawac felt it had to make it work in order to stay productive. &quot;There are 
fewer platers out there today, and with the increase in the demand for 
productivity and absolute quality, we had to find a way to deliver,&quot; stated Mr. Fail. 
And Rawac did!     <B>PF</B>

<H3>"Art" History</H3>
<P><B>Art Gianakopoulos</B> is the son of Greek immigrants. He 
aspired to work in international marketing, but he ended up in 
plating. How did that happen? His brother introduced him to the 
founder of Rawac Plating, Foster Compton. Although he did not 
know much about plating, he started working at Rawac in 1967. 
<P>In 1970, Mr. Gianakopoulos and his brother purchased 
Rawac Plating. This was also the beginning of his involvement in 
the National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF). 
Mr. Gianakopoulos attributes the success of his company to 
his association with others in the plating industry. His active 
participation in NAMF eventually led to his election as 
president of the association in 1990. 
<P>Plating is not his only business. Mr. Gianakopoulos 
also owns the Kreider Corporation, which specializes in small 
metal stampings and wire forms. He also acquired Southeastern 
Sales, a plumbing and heating distributor. In 1989 he purchased 
the Champion Company, an 111-year-old manufacturer of 
embalming fluids and other products for the funeral industry. 
This company has established a division that manufactures 
steel shipping containers for jet engines and missile parts for the 
U.S. Government. 
<P>Not only is Mr. Gianakopoulos involved in business, he 
is involved in his community as well. He was elected Ohio 
Employer of the Year of Handicapped Persons and received 
recognition from the local Mental Health Community for his 
work helping the handicap. He has handicapped employees that 
have been working at Rawac for more than 15 years.
