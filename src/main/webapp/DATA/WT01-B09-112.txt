<B>Project Title:  Rotary Engine for Hybrid Transit Bus<p>

Performing Organization:  APS Systems, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:	Ed Atelian  (805) 984-0300</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>APS Systems is developing a purpose-built full-size transit bus, for demonstration by two major California transit districts.  This bus will incorporate advanced composite materials in its frame and body, to reduce the vehicle's weight and its energy requirements.  The drive train for the bus consists of two Rexroth Indramat 100 kW AC motors, powered by Saft nickel-cadmium batteries.  This bus will incorporate many of the novel design features of APS' recently-delivered 35-foot electric transit bus, now in service with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District.</P>

<P>A unique feature of this bus is that it incorporates a new auxiliary power unit from Alturdyne, Inc.  This 40 kW generator set, to be used for range extension on the electric transit bus, uses a high-efficiency, low-emission, multi-fuel rotary engine under development by Alturdyne.  The APU is a two-rotor engine, coupled to an electric generator capable of producing a nominal voltage of 300 V.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>This program will produce and put integrate hybrid electric bus, incorporating a rotary engine auxiliary power unit.  Detailed operational and performance data will also be collected and summarized through the CALSTART data acquisition effort.  The bus will be placed into service in July, 1996, for an 18 month demonstration period.</P>
