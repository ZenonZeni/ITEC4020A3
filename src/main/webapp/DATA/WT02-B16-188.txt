<h2>Gallium Arsenide</h2>
<p><font size=+2>G</font>allium arsenide (GaAs) is a compound semiconductor: a mixture of two elements, gallium (Ga)
and arsenic (As).  Gallium is a byproduct of the smelting of other metals, notably aluminum and
zinc, and it is rarer than gold.  Arsenic is not rare, but it is poisonous.  Gallium arsenide's use in solar
cells has been developing synergistically with its use in light-emitting diodes, lasers, and other
optoelectronic devices.

<p>GaAs is especially suitable for use in <a href="multijunction2.html">multijunction</a> and high-efficiency solar
cells for several reasons:

<p>1.  The GaAs <a href="bandgaps.html">band gap</a> is 1.43 eV, nearly ideal for single-junction
solar cells.

<p>2.  GaAs has an absorptivity so high it requires a cell only a few microns thick to absorb
<a href="lightsun.html">sunlight</a>. (<a href="sipolysi.html">Crystalline silicon</a> requires a 
layer 100 microns or more in thickness.)

<p>3.  Unlike silicon cells, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat. (Cell temperatures can often
be quite high, especially in <a href="concentrators.html">concentrator</a> applications.)

<p>4.  Alloys made from GaAs using aluminum, phosphorus, antimony, or indium have
characteristics complementary to those of gallium arsenide, allowing great flexibility in cell
design.

<p>5.  GaAs is very resistant to radiation damage.  This, along with its high <a href="conveff.html">efficiency</a>, 
makes GaAs very desirable for space applications.

<p>One of the greatest advantages of gallium arsenide and its alloys as PV cell materials is the wide
range of design options possible.  A cell with a GaAs base can have several layers of slightly
different compositions that allow a cell designer to precisely control the generation and
collection of <a href="ptype.html">electrons and holes</a>. (To accomplish the same thing, silicon cells have been limited
to variations in the level of doping.) This degree of control allows cell designers to push
efficiencies closer and closer to theoretical levels.  For example, one of the most common GaAs
cell structures uses a very thin window layer of aluminum gallium arsenide.  This thin layer
allows electrons and holes to be created close to the electric field at the
junction.
