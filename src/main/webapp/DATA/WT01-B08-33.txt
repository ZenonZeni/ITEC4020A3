<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">A Proposal For The Future
Of The Islands</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>LONDON. (MP).-</strong> A future of
independence, or leading to some form of autonomy to be decided
by the islanders, having both Great Britain and Argentina as
guarantors, is the essence of the paper which is being informally
circulated in Argentina, Great Britain and the Falklands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The man responsible for the draft proposal
is Alistair Forsyth, a merchant banker, member of the Argentine
British Conference, who has taken to heart the South Atlantic
dispute.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One of the basic arguments of the paper is
that the 163 years old conflict won't be solved to complete
satisfaction of any of the sides involved. Another the growing
sense of identity and confidence developed by the now
economically autonomous islanders which could convince them to
break away from the motherly protection of Britain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;<em>A strong, brave political
leadership from both Argentina and Britain could help find a way
to overcome with honour for all parts, the ever present potential
for crisis</em>&quot;, says Forsyth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">During a transition period of ten to twenty
years both Argentina and Britain would have a presence in the
islands helping to preserve a very unique way of life and
collaborating with the preparations for independence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At a pre-established date both guarantors
would leave the islands, meaning the end of the colony, and the
local population can then decide and strongly develop their own
future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Forsyth believes links and trade with the
continent would be normalized and the islands would benefit from
all that the Argentines have to offer them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;<em>Argentina during these last years
has shown pragmatism, political maturity and unequal boldness to
reform the society and change long established beliefs; why
should they not accept the Forsyth paper for discussion?</em>&quot;. </font></p>
