<p><strong>PV Powers New Rattlesnake Cove Recreation Site</strong>

<p><img border=0 hspace=15 vspace=3 align=left src="images/tonto.gif"> 
<p>In December 1995, a PV system began to provide power for water pumping and
rest-room lighting at a new day-use recreational area in Tonto National Forest's Rattlesnake
Cove on Bartlett Reservoir, about an hour's drive north of Phoenix. The 2.2-kilowatt PV system
provides more than 10,000 gallons of water per day for the day-use area restroom, showers, and
picnic site. A separate 240-watt system powers the restroom lights, fans, and motion sensors.
Because grid power was several miles from the site and a line extension would have to run
underground, PV was the cheapest alternative on a first-cost basis. System installation was
performed by two Arizona companies, Solar Exchange and Solarjack. 

<p>The Rattlesnake PV project is one of a dozen pilot projects identified by the U.S. Forest Service
and Sandia National Laboratories, all of which are designed to be replicable and which were
selected to incorporate diversity in both geographic location and application. These pilot
projects are part of the Renew the Forests partnership of the DOE Photovoltaics Division,
Sandia, and the U.S. Forest Service. The Renew the Forests project included a survey in which
several hundred existing projects were identified that are currently in need of power and which
can be best served by PV. There are many more future projects in this same class, offering a
potentially large sustainable market to the PV industry. The key to capturing this market is for
the industry to create a financing mechanism so that the Forest Service and other federal
agencies can buy the systems. For more information, read the complete
