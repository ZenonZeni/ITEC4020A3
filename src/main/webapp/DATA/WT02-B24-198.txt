<H3><CENTER><A NAME=break>Breakthrough in IVF Triples Success
Rates</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><A NAME=break><CENTER>New Hope for Infertile Couples and Failed
IVF patients</CENTER></A>
</H4><P>
<P>A preliminary study of IVF procedures in which an embryo is transferred
to a host surrogate mother (gestational surrogate) reports a pregnancy rate
of 30% and a take home baby rate of 28 % per cycle for clients in our program.
This is a remarkable figure, considering that according to a study of IVF
success rates published in the March, 1988 issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine, the pregnancy rate for traditional IVF programs (not using a
gestational surrogate) is between 10-15%, while the take-home baby rate is
only 8 % per cycle. Success rates for IVF when used in conjunction with a
healthy fertile, gestational surrogate mother during her unstimulated, natural
cycle, is over three times greater than in traditional IVF programs. This
information will be more thoroughly presented by the Center for Surrogate
Parenting to the World Congress in In-Vitro Fertilization in Jerusalem on
April 2-7, 1989, in a <A HREF=Handel.html>keynote speech </A>by Center Director,
Attorney <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Bill">William Handel</A>.
<P>Mr. Handel, on behalf of the Center's clients, has successfully petitioned
the California Superior Court to declare the biological parents of the child
carried by a gestational surrogate to be the natural and legal parents of
their baby. While the surrogate bears the child for the biological parents,
the parents' names appear on the birth certificate as the mother and father
of the child. Thus the need for any adoption procedures is eliminated.
<P>Because of the expanded possibilities and greater chances for conception,
a growing number of in-vitro fertilization clinics, as well as individual
physicians, have requested the help and participation of the Center for Surrogate
Parenting in providing all non-medical components for their
<A HREF=surrpar.html>Host Surrogate Programs</A>. These professional services
include finding, screening, counseling and matching of IVF/host surrogates,
providing the contractual agreements and administration of trust funds.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=egg>New Comprehensive Egg Donor Program
Offered</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>Many couples who are considering surrogate parenting may now be candidates
for a comprehensive <A HREF=EggD.html>Egg Donor Program</A> offered by the
Center for Surrogate Parenting. Egg donation enables a select portion of
the infertile community to take advantage of new reproductive technologies.
Women who can carry a pregnancy but who cannot produce viable eggs (or whose
eggs carry a genetic defect) can conceive through the In-Vitro Fertilization
process with donor eggs and bear a child. No adoption is necessary as the
woman who gives birth is considered the legal and natural mother.
<P>In the past, egg donor programs have relied on IVF patients (who are infertile
to begin with) to donate excess eggs to infertile couples on a random basis.
Until now, there has never been a formal program that specifically solicited,
screened and matched egg donors with prospective recipients, as well as
coordinating all legal, psychological and administrative functions. The Center
reports that there is no wait for the many carefully screened egg donors
who are available to assist an infertile couple.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=legal>Legal Status of Surrogacy in
California</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>We are pleased to report that California still remains one of the most
enlightened states in its attitude towards surrogate parenting. The California
courts, the Department of Adoptions and the enforcement agencies throughout
the state have consistently cooperated with us and facilitated the surrogate
process. The Petition for Adoption (stepparent), Judgment of Paternity and
Judgment of Genetic Parenthood have been accomplished smoothly in concert
with courts and state agencies.
<P>In early 1989, a legislative task force was formed to study surrogate
parenting and recommend legislation that would protect all parties involved.
The Center for Surrogate Parenting has been asked to provide model legislation
for the task force to study, thus establishing California as one of the first
states to consider enlightened and comprehensive surrogate legislation.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=opts>OPTS: The Organization for Parenting Through
Surrogacy</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>OPTS is a non-profit, national volunteer organization based in Los Angeles,
founded in 1988 by parents whose children were born through surrogacy or
by other birth methods. OPTS advocates, supports and protects the birth rights
of all children. OPTS actively seeks to keep open the options made available
by the new reproductive technologies to infertile couples. Kathe Linden,
founder and spokesperson for OPTS, has appeared on numerous occasions before
the California State Legislature as an expert witness, representing the views
and concerns of infertile couples.
<P>OPTS also acts as a resource for information about surrogacy. A primary
objective is to facilitate the exchange of information between couples just
beginning to explore the process with couples who have already had a child
through surrogacy.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=research>Research Pays Off for Infertile
Couple</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting, with the help of an infertile couple
in its program, has pioneered the recent development and use of TEST YOLK
BUFFER for fresh semen shipping. This enables a husband to collect a semen
specimen at home and ship overnight (via Federal Express or other next-day
courier service) to the inseminating physician's office for a next day
insemination - without freezing or even refrigerating the sample.
<P>Not only is damage from freezing eliminated, but the Test Yolk can actually
improve the sperm's ability to penetrate the egg. Unlike frozen sperm, semen
shipped in Test Yolk Buffer can be manipulated as if it were a fresh sample;
for example, it can be washed for intrauterine inseminations, if necessary.
<P>In addition to the superior quality of semen in Test Yolk Buffer, the
time and costs involved in inseminations for our out-of-town clients are
dramatically less than for frozen sperm. The Center's infertile couple who
did extensive research of their own on Test Yolk Buffer (since he was using
it himself), greatly contributed to the development of its use in our program.
We are delighted to announce that their research has proved fruitful and
they are currently expecting their first child.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=nasm>NASM:&#160;National Association of Surrogate
Mothers</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The National Association of Surrogate Mothers (NASM) represents the views
of the vast majority of surrogate mothers in the United States who feel very
positively about their participation in a surrogate mother program and strongly
believe that it is their constitutional right to create a child for an infertile
couple.
<P>Beginning in 1987, Ms. Jan Sutton, R.N. president of NASM, and several
other members of the National Association of Surrogate Mothers visited state
legislatures throughout the United States, appearing as expert witnesses
and disseminating information, advice, and experience in the area of surrogate
parenting from the surrogate's perspective.
<P>The philosophy of the National Association of Surrogate Mothers is that
surrogate parenting is a viable option for infertile couples and that the
practice must be regulated and controlled. The safeguards must be strict
and rigorous, and the professionals involved must be well trained, conscientious,
and at all times be held accountable. With the safeguards in place, surrogacy
not only is an option that should be available to infertile couples, but
it also has been an extremely successful method of creating a family.

</H3><P>
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting is pleased to announce its tenth pregnancy
in the IVF/Host Surrogate Program, including one set of twins born in December
1988.
<P>We concluded 1988 with a total of 83 births. The year 1989 promises a
record number of deliveries in our traditional, non-IVF program (we have
18 pregnancies in progress), as well as our IVF/Host Surrogate Program and
the new Egg Donor Program.
<P>In 1988-89, under the direction of <A HREF=Hillbio.html>Dr. Hilary
Hanafin</A>, the Center participated in five separate, independent studies
on the various aspects of surrogate parenting, acting as a general resource
and providing statistics as well as professional opinions and recommendations.
These five studies are providing interesting insights and will be published
later this year.
<P>In 1987-88, The Center for Surrogate Parenting was joined by three new
members. Elizabeth Tilles, Program Coordinator at the Center, has had a child
delivered by a surrogate mother as well as personally having struggled through
the infertility maze including IVF. Carol Sanchez has joined us to work as
a psychotherapist with Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D. Ms. Sanchez has a degree in
Marriage, Family and Child counseling and is a former surrogate mother candidate
with our program. Janice Paur, our Administrator, struggled for years with
infertility herself, and with the help of a specialist, is happy to report
that she is now the mother of three sons.
<P>We invite inquires from anyone wishing to have any information of surrogate
parenting or using the Center as a resource regarding various aspects of
infertility.

<H4>ZIFT pregnancies
</H4><P>Dr. Richard Marrs of Los Angeles (Hospital of the Good Samaritan)
reports that he has achieved two successful ZIFT (zygote intra fallopian
transfer) pregnancies (out of four attempts) with Host Surrogate Mothers
from the Center's program. In addition, through his own programs, the traditional
IVF process, Dr. Marrs has achieved five pregnancies using frozen embryos.
<P>
<H4>IVF/Host Surrogate Mothers success rates
</H4><P>Dr. Jirair Konialian of Granada Hills Medical Group (Century City
Hospital) reports one of the highest success rates utilizing the IVF/Surrogate
process. Dr. Konialian also notes that preliminary statistics from throughout
the U.S. on IVF/Surrogate procedures indicate that these success rates are
not aberrational.
<P>
<H4>ZIFT without surgery
</H4><P>Using specially developed instruments, Dr. Ricardo Asch (University
of California, Irvine) has achieved a viable pregnancy by performing an
ultrasound guided low-tubal transfer of an embryo to the fallopian tube.
<P>
<H4>Retrospective study
</H4><P>Dr. Jaroslav Marik (Los Angeles) is doing a retrospective study based
on thirteen years of work in the field of surrogate parenting, in both
traditional (AI) and IVF/Host surrogacy.

<P>THE FOLLOWING ARE THE RESULTS OF <A HREF=Hanafin.html>THE SURVEY</A> CONDUCTED
ON SURROGATE MOTHERS AND COUPLES WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE SURROGATE PROCESS.
IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION CONVENTION NEW
YORK ON AUGUST 28, 1987.
<P>This study included follow-up surveys that were mailed to surrogate mothers
who had relinquished a child and to couples who had received a child through
the surrogate process. The survey consisted of 25 questions, both short answer
and likert scale, that addressed their reactions to and thoughts about their
surrogacy experience. A questionnaire was mailed to the 37 sets of adoptive
parents who had received children from these surrogate mothers. Of the adoptive
couples, 16 responded.
<P>The infertile couples reported very little emotional discomfort due to
their having worked with a surrogate mother. Of the 16 couples, three reported
stress and discomfort concerning the artificial insemination process and
anxiety regarding achieving a conception, and three others reported that
they had wished they had been more involved with the pregnancy. The infertile
couples consistently reported that the child's genetic connection to only
one parent had very little influence on how they related to closeness and
understanding because of their genetic relation to the child. All of the
couples reported that they perceived the child as theirs, not as the surrogate's
or a child they feel is shared with the surrogate. It could be hypothesized
that the surrogate's and couples' shared perception that the child is the
couple's helps to minimize discomfort.
<P>Both surrogates and couples reported that they felt they had sufficient
contact with the other party. The twenty surrogates who responded all had
post-partem contact through the child's first birthday. Of the nine surrogates
for whom over two years or more has passed, all but one had contact through
the second year. Typically, the adoptive parents sent cards and photos at
Christmas and/or the child's birthday. Fourteen of the surrogates who
participated in the study reported that they had met face-to-face with the
couple and child at least once after saying good-bye at the hospital. Only
one couple reported any degree of fear that the surrogate will make uninvited
contact. Within this group of adoptive parents, 15 couples stated that they
plan to tell the child of its adoption, and one couple was uncertain as to
what they would do.
<P>The infertile couples and the surrogate mothers seemed to agree on several
points in this follow-up survey. None of the couples of the surrogate mothers
regretted their decision to participate in the program. Additionally, they
both reported that knowing each other was beneficial to their experience.
In the surrogate's reports, as well as in the couple's reports, the appreciation,
warmth, sharing, and knowledge of each other were helpful in making the
experience meaningful and enabled the surrogate to more easily relinquish
the child. They also predicted that knowing each other benefited the children
involved. For instance, both sample groups felt that surrogate mothers should
have a psychological evaluation prior to participation in such a program.
<P>This study suggests that contact between the individuals and the families
who have come together to create this child should be open. The contact appears
to provide a positive and communicative environment for all participants.
Furthermore, the open relationship helps to minimize secrecy and denial which
are detrimental to the children.
