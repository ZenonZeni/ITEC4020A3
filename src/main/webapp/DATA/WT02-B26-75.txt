<H2>The Best of Times, The Worst of Times</H2>
by Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D., Deputy Director of Policy and Research 

 <HR>


Note:  The following remarks were presented at a symposium on 
schizophrenia research sponsored by the National Foundation for 
Brain Research and NAMI in March 1996 at the U.S. Congress.
<p>

	The reality of schizophrenia in America in 1996 harkens back 
to Charles Dickens’ famous opening to A Tale of Two Cities-
¾about it being the best of times and the worst of times.  
People with schizophrenia, as perhaps in no other time in 
history, confront an almost unbelievable sense of hope for 
effective treatment and high quality of life as well as fears of 
tragedy and suffering.  
<p>
	Yes, in many ways, these are the best of times.  Not so long 
ago, schizophrenia was considered an enigma, a hopeless illness, 
a dark family secret, a scourge, moral failing, certainly a 
desert and no-man's-land for scientists and doctors. The noted 
historian, Gerald Grob, has written that in the 1940s the 
“obstacles blocking fundamental biological research into mental 
illnesses were formidable¼it would have been impossible to 
predict that¼.scientists would develop substances that had the 
potential to modify the symptoms associated 
with...schizophrenia.”
<p>
	Yet there have been tremendous advances in schizophrenia 
science.  In the last year alone, there were reports documenting 
developmental hazards-¾such as Rh incompatibility between mother 
and fetus and extreme malnutrition during fetal development-
¾that double the risk of schizophrenia.  Several studies 
pinpointed the regions of the brain that are structurally and 
functionally altered in schizophrenia.  A major paper reported 
that a gene contributing to schizophrenia is likely to be located 
on chromosome 6.  Reported data evidenced the effectiveness of a 
new schizophrenia drug¾-olanzapine-¾making it the third new 
drug for schizophrenia made available in a few short years, after 
literally decades of no medication advances.  Another ten-year 
study presented this year showed that effective medical treatment 
coupled with intensive community supports and employment services 
led to a 50 percent employment rate for this population.  
<p>
	These and other data represent stunning progress.  To quote 
a prominent schizophrenia researcher-¾Dr. Danny Weinberger-¾“20 
years ago, the principal challenge for schizophrenia research was 
to gather objective scientific evidence that would implicate the 
brain.  This challenge no longer exists...no longer can there be 
any doubt that there is an underlying brain pathology.”
<p>
	Schizophrenia is a brain disorder.  It is not a problem of 
living.  It is not a philosophical dilemma.  It is not the result 
of your mother’s not breast-feeding you as a child.  
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder.  
<p>
	Of course much more research needs to be done, but 
schizophrenia science is a mature, sophisticated science, with 
all of the tools of modern biomedicine, molecular biology, 
genetics, brain imaging, pharmacology, and services research. 
Most importantly, there is a growing arsenal of effective 
treatments and support services that reduce symptoms, decrease 
hospitalization, improve functioning and quality of life, and 
even employment outcomes.    
<p>
	These are really the best of times.  
<p>
	But, these are also the worst times imaginable.  
Approximately 1.7 million American adults have the brain disorder 
called schizophrenia.  No more than 15 percent of them have a 
job.  They make up more than half of the long-term residents of 
state and county mental hospitals. They, and others with severe 
mental illnesses, make-up at least one-third of our nation’s 
homeless population.  Between 10 and 15 percent of individuals 
with schizophrenia commit suicide, usually before the age of 30. 
<p>
 For 20 percent or more, schizophrenia is a chronically 
deteriorating illness; for most people with this brain disorder, 
it follows a long-term course, with relapses of frightening 
symptoms and prolonged disability.  Approximately 8 percent of 
people in our jails have schizophrenia and other severe mental 
illnesses¾they are usually housed there for want of appropriate 
treatment and housing facilities.  People with schizophrenia and 
other severe mental illnesses are disproportionately the victims 
of crime.  
<p>
	So, despite tremendous progress in research, the reality of 
schizophrenia is in many ways a very grim one¾for people with 
this illness, for their families, and for our nation.  This grim 
reality certainly reflects the nature of this chronic brain 
disease¾but it also reflects failed policies.  To again quote 
the historian Grob:  “Americans have yet to define a mental 
health policy that integrates decent and humane care with access 
to medical services for severely and chronically mentally ill 
persons.”  
<p>
	What are the policy implications of our profound research 
success and the desperate plight of so many people who suffer the 
disease of schizophrenia?
<p>
	First, we must redouble our schizophrenia research efforts. 
 Great discovery¾indeed breakthrough is within our grasp.  We 
have the research tools, we have some of the best brains in 
scientific research, and we have answerable scientific questions.
<p>
	The scientific opportunity is upon us.  We must increase the 
amount of research on this disease.  Congress and NIMH must make 
this a top research priority¾and increase funding and focus on 
schizophrenia research.
<p>
	The research we rightly celebrate is but a seed for the 
research successes within our grasp, if only we would truly 
reach.  This schizophrenia research is also the seed of informed 
and humane policy.  Research data tell us to reject 
discrimination against schizophrenia, to make available the 
effective treatments, services, and supports that we now have to 
the people who need it.  Only by enhancing research, ending 
insurance discrimination, and assuring access to effective 
treatment and services can we ensure that every person with 
schizophrenia will realize his or her best possible recovery.  
Let’s abide by and build on the successes of schizophrenia 
research¾-and make these simply the best of times.
