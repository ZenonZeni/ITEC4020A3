<H2><I>E. </I>DSM Programs Could Become an Essential Utility Service in a 
Restructured Utility Industry<BR></H2>

<BR>
The utility industry is in the middle of a major restructuring. Adoption 
of the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct)<a href="#126" name="r126"> [ 126 ] </a>has, by deregulating 
electricity sales among wholesale power buyers, stimulated a competitive 
wholesale power market while leaving end-user deregulation to the 
states.<a href="#127" name="r127"> [ 127 ] </a>Although the prospect of increased competition is leading some 
utilities to reduce or eliminate their DSM programs (because these 
programs often increase electricity prices), on a national level, DSM 
expenditures by utilities are projected to rise steadily through 1998.<a href="#128" name="r128"> [ 128 ] </a>
Utilities are likely to refocus their DSM programs on customer service and 
customer productivity in an effort to retain market share and to gain new 
customers.<a href="#129" name="r129"> [ 129 ] </a>
<p>     The transition to competitive markets is a window of opportunity for 
improved energy efficiency and renewables development. The bottom line is 
that the new industry structure should be <I>more efficient</I> - both 
economically and in terms of environmental protection. Enhanced 
competition and environmental protection need not be enemies. 
Restructuring and re-regulation of the utility industry must incorporate 
efficiency and renewables development if the United States is to meet its 
international obligations to reduce the threat of global climate 
change.<P>

42 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 13201-556 (West Supp. 1994) (EPAct). Title XVI of 
EPAct, titled "Global Climate Change," set forth a number of targets 
designed to promote a national least-cost energy strategy, including:<BR>
(a) A 30 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2010, based upon 1988 
levels;(b) A 75 percent increase in the use of renewable energy by 2005, 
based upon 1988 levels;(c) A reduction in U.S. oil consumption from 40 
percent to 35 percent of total energ<BR>
y use by 2005.<BR>
<P><A NAME="127"  HREF="#r127">127.</a> There are important reasons to restructure the present 
vertically-integrated utilities, and spin off generation, transmission, 
and distribution as separate legal entities&#173;including conflicts of 
interest among the three functions. For example, the business purpose of 
generation companies will be to maintain as much market share as possible 
within current retail service territories. On the other hand, distribution 
companies in a restructured industry - which provide hook-up services 
to end users -  will seek to influence the generation portfolios that 
serve many, if not all, of their customers. Distribution companies will be 
in the energy services business, and will seek to provide a mix of energy 
resources as demanded by end-use customers. The portfolio provided by 
distribution companies may well include a mix that maximizes energy 
efficiency and renewables over more polluting generation sources. If the 
distribution companies help in any way to select the winners in an 
increasingly competitive generation marketplace, distribution's ownership 
of some of the generation competitors is a fundamental conflict of 
interest. Divestiture is perhaps the only solution. The utility industry 
would ultimately be comprised of independent electricity distribution, 
transmission, and generation companies. <I>See</I> Cavanagh, R.,
