<H2>May is Rabies Awareness Month
</H2>
</CENTER>

May has been declared Rabies Awareness Month to help increase public knowledge of how to prevent and avoid rabies.  Local agencies are encouraged to promote this month so that people will be better able to protect themselves, their children and their pets.<P>

Southern Ontario once held the unhappy title of "Rabies Capital of North America."  In 1967, the Ontario and federal governments combined resources to ensure that research into the cause and spread of the disease went hand-in-hand with measures to protect the public.  Using an oral vaccine dropped from airplanes, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has been immunizing red foxes, the main carrier of rabies to livestock and pets, who may then pass on the disease to humans. <P> 
<B>Is the threat of rabies disappearing?</B><P> 
<UL>



<LI>Not yet.  Although Ontario is making progress in eliminating fox rabies, a variant of rabies spread by raccoons is moving quickly through the northeastern United States.  Unless it can be stopped, this type of rabies 	will spread into Ontario.<P> 
<LI>To create a protective barrier, MNR has inoculated raccoons against rabies in areas where diseased animals are most likely to enter Ontario.  Researchers are working to develop an oral vaccine for raccoons so that aerial vaccination could be used to eliminate the disease over large areas, if it were to reach Ontario.  It is important that people know what to expect so that they can take precautions against spreading the disease by unwittingly transporting racoons from outside Ontario into the province, or moving them around inside the province.<P> 
</UL>
<B>How can people protect themselves?</B><P> 
<UL>
<LI>Being aware of how you can protect yourself from rabies is your number-one defence.  You should vaccinate your pets, avoid stray or wild animals, and call your doctor and your local health unit if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal. 
<LI>Various government departments and the veterinary profession are working together in the fight against rabies.  They are members of a Raccoon Rabies Task Force which is helping communities throughout Ontario develop a local action plan for managing any localized raccoon rabies outbreak and to prevent it from spreading.  Several communities already have such a plan in place.	


<LI>"Raccoon Rabies Approaches Southern Ontario", is an educational package on rabies available from Ontario school board offices for use by teachers and students at the intermediate level.
