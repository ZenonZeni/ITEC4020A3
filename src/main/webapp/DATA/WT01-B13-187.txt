KEMPER MONEY FUNDS BUILD A SOUTH PACIFIC HIDE-AWAY
 ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB</H3>
<P>
<B>CHICAGO</B> (August 19) -- Have a question about money market funds?
 If you do, it's time to pay a visit to a mysterious millionaire
located at <A HREF="http://www.kempercash.com">kempercash.com.</A>  This experienced investor, based on
a private island in the South Pacific, guides visitors through
the essentials of money market funds.
<P>
 &quot;While islands in the South Pacific usually don't come to
mind when you think about money funds, we thought this would be
an unusual 'location' for our new web site,&quot; said Mike Harrington,
the Kemper Funds Group senior vice president for money fund marketing.
 &quot;Our goal was to create a relaxed site on an essential,
yet overlooked, investment.&quot;
<P>
 Harrington added that while several large fund families, including
Kemper Funds, have web sites featuring their entire investment
line-up, this is the first site that just focuses on a particular
fund category.
<P>
Drawing on his years of investment experience, the site's host
provides comprehensive information on how to select a money fund.
 His &quot;Financial Jargon to Plain English Dictionary,&quot;
which defines relevant terms such as commercial paper and repurchase
agreements, is designed to, &quot;...help make you fluent when
talking about money fund investments.&quot;  Current 7-day yields
and competitive rankings for Kemper Money Market Fund, Kemper
Government Money Fund and Kemper Tax-Free Money Fund are available.
 The site also allows visitors to try two different investment
scenarios with Kemper Money Market Fund.
<P>
 Harrington stated that the site will be expanded to offer new
features and to reflect visitor feedback.  The site just established
reciprocal links with the IBC/Financial Data web site and will
soon add the Kemper Money Funds prospectus and an application.
 <P>
 The <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for the Kemper Money Funds containing more complete
information, including management fees and expenses, is available
by calling 800/537-6001.  Investors should read it carefully before investing
or sending money.  Money funds seek to maintain a net asset value
of $1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that they will.
 Fund shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>
<A HREF="../../about/aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> (ZKI), formerly Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., is one of the largest investment managers headquartered
in North America, having more than $78 billion in assets under management.  ZKI is the
investment advisor to the Kemper Funds.
<P>
 The Kemper Family of Funds consists of 36 funds, with over 70
portfolios, representing approximately $45 billion in assets and
3 million shareholder accounts.  Kemper Distributors, Inc., a
subsidiary of ZKI, is the principal underwriter and distributor
of the Kemper Funds.
