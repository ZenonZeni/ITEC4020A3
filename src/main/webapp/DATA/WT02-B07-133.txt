<LI><A HREF="http://www.coastalo.com"><B>Coastal Oceanographics</B></A>
Their HYPACK navigation and multibeam software is the de-facto standard for offshore search and survey work in the U.S. and around the world.  They're so prevelant that they sponsor their own multibeam conference attended annually by hundreds of surveyors.  Check out their list of supported devices...  If they don't support a device, it probably doesn't exist.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.datasonics.com"><B>Datasonics</B></A>
manufactures many kinds of sonars and underwater acoustic devices.
Their state-of-the-art technology puts them in a league of their own.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.edgetech.com"><B>Edgetech</B></A> (formerley EG&G) has two divisions: Marine and Moisture/Humidity.  The marine group's history goes all the way back to it's founder "Doc" Edgerton, the inventor of Side Scan Sonar.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.kleinsonar.com"><B>Klein</B></A>
is one of the largest sidescan sonar manuacturers in the world.  The web page includes some great sonar records.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.reson.com"><B>Reson</B></A>
manufactures multibeam sonars with optional sidescan capability.  Their product line has recently been
expanded to include a lower-frequency multibeam system.  The St. Furges Bay data on our Software Demo was taken with one of their 9001 multibeam systems.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.bbsr.edu/"><B>Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc.</B></A>
From the perspective of a mid-ocean island, and with the benefit of a 115-foot flagship, this organization has a long and rich history of high-quality research in the surrounding waters. Find out more of what they do, educational projects, and more.<LI><A HREF="http://igpp.ucsd.edu/"><B>Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP)</B></A>
The San Diego branch of the University of California's IGPP is strongly linked to Scripps Institution of Oceanography, so marine geophysics would appear to be a real strength of their program. Find out more at this information rich site.<LI><A HREF="http://www-ceob.nos.noaa.gov/"><B>The Coastal and Estuarine Oceanography Branch</B></A>
An interesting site for the branch of the National Ocean Service's Office of Ocean and Earth Science that is responsible for the U.S. tide and tidal current tables and conducts research into all aspects of the physics of coastal waterways.  Don't leave before you check out the HTML-ized tide glossary.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.ices.inst.dk/"><B>International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)</B></A>
This intergovernmental marine science organization offers a 
 humongous database of its environmental and fish assessments, a 

 listing of ocean codes and cruise summary reports, and much, much 

 more. And when last checked on, they showed a position 

 vacant--GLOBEC co-ordinator--which sounds mighty important.<LI><A HREF="http://www.jamstec.go.jp/"><B>Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC)</B></A>
Voyage to the bottom of the sea with this government, academic 
 and private sponsored organization which specializes in deep sea bottom 

 research and other matters of the deep. Many GIFs.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.nnic.noaa.gov/"><B>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</B></A>
The focus is on oceanic research and weather.  You could spend days following their many links and never leave the umbrella of NOAA.

<LI><IMG SRC="/hot.gif"><A HREF="http://www.marine-group.com"><B>Marine Group</B></A> From the man who wrote the book (literally!) -- John Fish brings together text and pictures detailing all sorts of underwater equipment and detailed explanations.  Includes some great images of shipwrecks.  A "MUST SEE" web site.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/"><B>National Oceanographic Data Center</B></A>
The NODC holds global databases of physical, chemical, and biological
 oceanographic data, as well as many individual datasets. These data can be

 provided to users online, on CD-ROMs, and via FTP. A part of the 

 U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration.<LI><A 




<A HREF="http://nemo.ucsd.edu/"><B>NEMO - Oceanographic Data Server</B></A>
This highly specialized site contains data sets useful to physical oceanographers at La Jolla's  Scripps Institution of Oceanography where it's based -- most of which are available only locally, but some are accessible by all.<LI><A HREF="http://research.nwfsc.noaa.gov/"><B>Northwest Fisheries Science Center</B></A>
A research facility of the Northwest Region of the National Marine Fisheries Service and NOAA.  They are responsible for providing scientific and technical support for the management, conservation, and development of the Pacific Northwest region's anadromous and marine fishery resources.<LI><A HREF="http://coast.usw.nps.navy.mil/"><B>NPS Coastal Acoustics Lab</B></A>
Outpost of the Navy's Postgraduate School sort of &quot;listens&quot; underwater in order to carry out experiments. Find details here on its Barents Sea and Point Sur projects. Lab is located in California.<LI><A HREF="http://diu.cms.udel.edu/"><B>The Ocean Information Center (OCEANIC)</B></A>

 geological and geophysical studies of the oceans as well as biological 
 research.<LI><A HREF="http://minnow.skio.peachnet.edu/"><B>Skidaway Institute of Oceanography</B></A>
Sounds like a great place to study -- an island off the coast 
 of Savannah, GA, and a skipping stone's throw from estuaries, 

 marshes and barrier islands.  This research facility of the University system 

 of Georgia offers info on themselves, recent technical reports online, and 

 links of underwater interest.
