<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Notes to Financial Statements for Annual Report</B></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Note A:</STRONG>  The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidation of New York Life Insurance Company (NYLIC) with its direct, wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries:  New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), New York Life and Health Insurance Company (NYLHIC), and NYLIFE Insurance Company of Arizona (NYLAZ).  NYLIC and such subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to collectively as "the Company".   Separate unconsolidated financial statements are shown for NYLIC and NYLIAC.  All significant intercompany transactions, primarily the net equity of the insurance subsidiaries, have been eliminated in consolidation.  Other subsidiaries are recorded at their underlying net equity, with the exception of NYLIC's investment in Express Scripts, Inc., a 69% owned subsidiary, which is carried at market value as allowed under New York State law.<P>

<P>NYLIC is a diversified financial services company which offers a wide range of insurance and investment products and services, including life and health insurance, pension products, mutual funds (through its broker-dealer subsidiary), and other investments, to a large cross section of the total insurance market.  NYLIAC offers a wide variety of interest sensitive insurance and annuity products.  Effective January 1, 1996, NYLIC merged its Health Maintenance Organization subsidiary, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, and its Group life and health indemnity operations (which will be transferred to NYLHIC via a reinsurance agreement) into an integrated health care subsidiary, NYLCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYLCare), whereby NYLHIC will be a downstream subsidiary of NYLCare.  NYLAZ expects to offer a Corporate Owned Life Insurance/Variable Universal Life product for sale in 1996.<P>


<STRONG>Note B:</STRONG>  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York and Delaware State Insurance Departments ("statutory accounting practices").  Presently, these statutory accounting practices are considered generally accepted accounting principles for mutual life insurance companies and their wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an Interpretation, effective for 1996 financial statements, which establishes a different definition of generally accepted accounting principles.  If the Company chooses to adopt the accounting changes required under this new definition, the effect of the changes would be reported retroactively through restatement of all previously issued financial statements presented for comparative purposes.  The cumulative effect of adopting these changes would be included in the earliest year restated.  Financial statements prepared in conformity with statutory accounting practices would continue to be required by insurance regulatory authorities.<P>

<P>Under statutory accounting practices:  (1) bonds and mortgage loans on real estate are stated principally at cost after amortization of premium and discount, preferred stocks are stated generally at cost, and common stocks are stated at market value; (2) the value of invested assets has been adjusted for impairments that are other than temporary; (3) an asset valuation reserve is reported as a liability; (4) an interest maintenance reserve is reported as a liability to capture interest-income over the estimated remaining lives of the investments sold; (5) premiums are taken into income over the premium-paying period of the policies; guaranteed investment contract funds are recorded as income when received; (6) matured guaranteed investment contracts are included in benefit payments; (7) commissions and other costs in connection with acquiring new business are charged to current operations as incurred; (8) pension costs are based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions"; (9) unfunded postretirement benefit costs other than pensions are based on National Association of Insurance Commissioners requirements, which include establishing a liability for retired and fully eligible active employees; (10) policy reserves are based on mortality tables and interest assumptions which are consistent with statutory requirements and are designed to be sufficient to provide for contractual benefits; (11) dividends to policyowners consist principally of dividends expected to be paid during the subsequent year; (12) provision is made for federal income taxes estimated to be payable; (13) certain assets designated as "non-admitted assets" are not included in the Statement of Financial Position; (14) in 1995, the Company changed its method of accounting for the equity base tax and as a result, federal income taxes were reduced by $46 million, $12 million and $58 million for NYLIC, NYLIAC and the Company, respectively.<P>

	<P><B>Note D:</B>  In 1995, NYLIC and NYLIAC settled a class action suit related to the sale of whole life and universal life policies from 1982 through 1994.  In connection with this and other litigation, after-tax provisions of $30 million and $45 million have been recorded in 1994 and 1995, respectively.  Also in 1995, NYLIC's investment in NYLIFE Inc. was reduced by $90 million after tax to reflect the potential discontinuance of NYLIFE Inc.'s proprietary partnership operations and certain claims made in connection therewith.</P>

	<P><B>Note E:</B>  In December 1993, NYLIC issued Surplus Notes with a principal balance of $450,000,000: $150,000,000, 6.40% Surplus Note, due 2003 and $300,000,000, 7.50% Surplus Note, due 2023.  The Notes do not repay principal prior to maturity.</P>

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION<P>
<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/cprecfntlo.gif" ALT="Price Waterhouse LLB Logo" ALIGN=TOP HSPACE="1" VSPACE="1"><P>

To the Board of Directors and Policyowners of New York Life Insurance Company<P>

We have audited the consolidated statement of financial position of New York Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, the unconsolidated statements of financial position of New York Life Insurance Company and of New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994.  We have also audited the related statements of operations, of changes in surplus and of cash flows (which are not presented herein) for the years then ended.  Our audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and in our reports dated February 16, 1996 we expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.  In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed financial statements, when read in conjunction with the financial statements from which it has been derived, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation thereto.<P>
