<hr>
<body>
I am Daniel A. Dreyfus, Director of the Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management.  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss our Fiscal
Year (FY) 1997 budget request and the revised strategy for the Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management Program, which is being developed in response to FY 1996 Energy and Water
Development Appropriations actions.
<p>
		       <strong>    BACKGROUND</strong>
<p>
<b>The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as Amended.</b>  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 created
the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management within the Department of Energy to
develop a system to accept, transport, store, and permanently dispose of spent nuclear fuel from
commercial utilities.  To pay for the system, the Act established a Nuclear Waste Fund financed
by fees from the ratepayers of nuclear utilities.  A presidential decision in 1985 directed that the
system also provide for the disposal of radioactive wastes resulting from atomic energy defense
activities.  A General Fund appropriation is made to offset the costs associated with the disposal
of defense-related waste.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 designated the
Yucca Mountain site in Nevada for detailed scientific investigation to evaluate the site's
suitability for a geologic repository.
<p>
<b>Program Approach.</b>  In 1994, we proposed a Program Approach and funding profile that would
permit us to meet the policy goals set by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  That
approach was pursued with the FY 1995 appropriation of $522 million for the program, which
represented an increase of $142 million over the FY 1994 funding level of $380 million.  The
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program followed the Program Approach into the Fall
of 1995, when we received new policy redirection from Congress in our FY 1996 appropriation.  
<p>
<b>PAST YEAR'S PROGRESS</b>
<p>
I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress since my last appearance before
this committee.  Almost all of the increase in funding for FY 1995 was allocated to, and utilized
by the Yucca Mountain Project, which completed the fiscal year with accomplishments that often
exceeded our targets.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain. </b> We have completed more than one-half of the planned five mile exploratory
studies facility tunnel at Yucca Mountain and are now tunneling through the proposed repository
horizon.  Four test alcoves have been excavated to install instrumentation and to provide
scientists with access to major geologic features.  Thus far, we have found no unexpected
geologic conditions that would contradict our hypotheses about the Yucca Mountain site.  We
have substantially reduced the scientific and technical uncertainty concerning the suitability of
the proposed repository site through the analysis of scientific data collected to date.Since last year, we also completed a performance assessment of the whole repository system,
which indicated that the man-made engineered features of the repository, in conjunction with the
natural elements of the site, could provide containment of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation. </b> Over the past year we made progress on
cask development and environmental requirements for the transport of waste, assuming waste
acceptance in 1998.  In preparation to move large quantities of waste, we have initiated
non-site-specific contingency planning which will increase our capability to respond to new
policy
direction on interim storage.  We have developed concepts for a national waste acceptance and
transportation strategy that relies on the private sector for implementation; and a generic safety
analysis for an interim storage facility that could expedite facility licensing and development time
if a site is authorized.
<p>
<b>Program Management.</b>  Since last March, major improvements have been made in the
integration and efficiency of program management.  We have continued to improve integration of
activities, clarify lines of authority and responsibility, and increase our coordination with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The participants in the program have now been fully
consolidated under the program's Management and Operating contractor.  We are concentrating
current attention on the improvement of management information tools (e.g., schedule, baseline,
and reporting processes).  As a consequence of our planning and management improvements, we
have been able to develop a program that can preserve the objectives of the Yucca Mountain
project at substantially reduced funding levels.
<p>
I am pleased that the independent Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board acknowledged our
progress in their February 23, 1996 letter to Secretary O'Leary.  The Board, which is kept
informed on the progress of the program in detail agreed that:
<p>
    <blockquote> "Significant progress has been made in a number of areas at Yucca Mountain
     during this past year.  The DOE has greatly increased the efficiency of the
     underground tunneling operation at the site; the main tunnel is now more than 2.5
     miles long and is exploring at the proposed repository level.  The DOE is
     obtaining data about the character and hydrology of the underground rock where
     waste eventually could be placed.  In addition, a clear and technically defensible
     waste isolation strategy is beginning to emerge.  This strategy will help explain
     how the natural and engineered barriers at the site should work together to isolate
     radioactive waste from the environment.  Together with recent advances in
     repository performance assessment, the strategy will enable the DOE to set
     priorities among exploration and testing activities to achieve a better
     understanding of the hydrology and other characteristics of the site -- in less time
     and at less cost.  Finally, current management is continuing to improve program
     focus and effectiveness."</blockquote>
<p>
 <b>  PROGRAM REDIRECTION AND TRANSITION</b>
<p>
The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY 1996 provided a total of $400
million in discretionary funds for the program, of which $85 million may be expended only for
an interim storage facility upon enactment of specific statutory authority.  Lacking such authority,
the program was reduced to a $315 million funding level for FY 1996, which represents a forty
percent reduction in the level of effort from FY 1995.  
<p>
Congress recognized that a more constrained repository program would be required.  The
Conference Report accompanying the appropriations language provided specific guidance to
refocus the Yucca Mountain Project to emphasize core scientific activity, excavation of sections
of the exploratory studies facility necessary for scientific study, and completion of the repository
and waste package conceptual design.  The guidance also provided for the deferral of activities
supporting preparation and filing of a license application for the repository.
<p>
<b>Revised Program Strategy. </b> Consistent with the guidance provided by Congress, we have
defined a revised program strategy compatible with our new funding profile.  With reasonable
future funding support, however, we believe that our revised strategy will enable the program to
regain the longer range objectives of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act regarding the evaluation of
geologic disposal as a means to permanently isolate commercial spent nuclear fuel and defense
high-level radioactive waste from the environment.  In the immediate near-term, we have focused
available resources on addressing the most critical technical issues remaining in the repository
program and on the necessary transitional costs of the program reduction.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.</b>  As Congress requested, we have refocused our efforts at Yucca Mountain to
address the critical unanswered technical questions leading to an assessment in 1998 of the
viability of licensing the proposed repository site.  These unanswered questions involve the
movement of water through the mountain, the presence of any geologic features that could
adversely impact repository performance, constraints on the repository's thermal load, selection
of materials for the waste packages, and the need for and feasibility of other engineered barriers
to enhance overall repository performance.
<p>
We have defined a set of products, consistent with FY 1996 Congressional guidance, that will
provide a better understanding of the repository design and its performance in the geologic
setting, a better appreciation of the remaining work needed to prepare a license application, and a
more accurate estimate of the cost of a repository.  We believe that these products taken together
will, by 1998, provide sufficient financial and technical data to allow the Congress to decide
whether to continue the program to repository licensing and construction.  Although Congress
also advised that repository licensing activities should be deferred in FY 1996, the long-range
goal of submitting a successful license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
remains central to the program's mission under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  The 1998
assessment will be an early and integral step on the path to preparing a repository environmental
impact statement and a license application.  Completion of the assessment by 1998 will be
possible because we can draw upon scientific studies done at the site since the 1970s, the large
amount of information collected over the past three years on site conditions, the progress already
made on the advanced conceptual designs for the repository and waste package, and the
understanding gained from the latest in our series of iterative total system performance
assessments.
<p>
Another key element of our revised program strategy will be to review and update the regulatory
framework for licensing a repository.  The existing framework that guides our investigation of
the Yucca Mountain site does not fully reflect policy changes since the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
was enacted in 1982, the experience of the past decade of work, and the realities of budgetary
constraints on the program.  Our objective is to focus on the safety considerations of the site
itself, while eliminating activities that are now known to be unnecessary to establish the safety of
the repository concept we will propose.  As I will explain later, we believe that we can regain a
target date of 2002 for submitting a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
for authorization to construct the repository.  That date will depend, of course, upon confirmation
of the viability of the Yucca Mountain site, a restructured approach to the remaining
regulatory-related work, and continued financial support.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation. </b> In response to Congressional direction, we
are closing out most of our waste acceptance, canister and cask development, and transportation
work.  We will not pursue the further development of a multi-purpose canister system for
transporting and disposing of spent fuel.  We believe that the multi-purpose canister approach is
sound, and private industry may elect to carry the design of one or more multi-purpose canister
systems forward.  The development and certification of advanced technology, legal-weight truck
casks for transportation of uncanistered spent fuel from reactors to a storage or disposal facility
will be phased out in an orderly manner to permit commercialization by private industry, if
warranted at a later date.  We plan to rely upon commercially available technologies when the
transportation of spent fuel begins.  In addition, we transferred the lead responsibility for the
multi-purpose canister environmental impact statement to the Department of the Navy, which has
a continuing requirement to document their decisions.
<p>
We have restructured our waste acceptance, storage, and transportation activities to maintain a
capability to respond quickly and effectively if new interim storage policy is forthcoming.  These
efforts will target two major near-term objectives.  First, we will work to engage industry in the
development of a market-driven waste acceptance and transportation strategy that relies heavily
on the private sector for implementation.  Second, we will conduct non-site-specific work on a
generic interim storage facility to make early progress toward an NRC license.
<p>
<b>Program Management. </b> As a result of the reduced FY 1996 funding level, we have had to
greatly reduce the contractor work scope and support in program management functions, which
include the activities of the Office of Human Resources and Administration, the Office of
Quality Assurance, and the Office of Program Management and Integration.  We have eliminated
approximately 1000 contractor positions at the Yucca Mountain Project and at our Washington,
D.C. headquarters.  We also reduced the funding we provide to maintain our cooperative
agreements with program stakeholders to one-third of their FY 1995 budgets.  As we took these
actions, we sought, within our existing authorities, to preserve essential program activities.
<p>
We have restructured our program management activities to further enhance our management
effectiveness.  Our primary objective is to retain the vital objectives of the program.  We will
concentrate on addressing significant cross-cutting technical issues; on improving the linkages
across the program through increased integration; on increasing the utilization of Federal staff
with a decreasing reliance on contractor support; and on major improvements in the program's
management tools such as schedules, baseline and change control, performance monitoring and
review, and reporting processes that will increase our ability to concentrate reduced resources on
meaningful accomplishments.
<p>
	       <b>  FY 1997 BUDGET REQUEST OVERVIEW</b>
<p>
The President's budget request for FY 1997 is consistent with the redirection resulting from the
FY 1996 budget reduction.  It will support the licensing approach that we have developed for the
repository program.
<p>
In order to support the scientific work on the permanent repository, the President's FY 1997
budget proposes to fund the program at a level of $400.028 million.  The civilian portion of the
radioactive waste management program is $200.028 million, to be derived from the Nuclear
Waste Fund.  The Defense share of $200 million is from the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal
Appropriation.  It will cover the cost associated with the disposal of defense high-level
radioactive waste in the repository.  The full amount is intended to be discretionary
appropriations.  No other legislative action is required to support the appropriation.
<p>
Of the $400 million request, $339 million will go to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project.  Of the remaining funds, $10 million will go to the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project, and $51 million will be required for Program Management activities.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.  </b>The $339 million we are requesting for FY 1997 will be used to address the
remaining scientific and technical uncertainties concerning the construction and operation of a
repository at Yucca Mountain; and to regain a viable target to file a license application for a
repository in the year 2002.
<p>
We will apply the FY 1997 funding toward work on the four primary components of the
repository viability assessment.
<p>
<i>First, </i>we will complete a package of specific design work on the critical elements of the
repository and the waste package, including a concept of operations that identifies available
technologies to accomplish the objectives of geologic disposal.
<p>
<i>Second,</i> we will prepare a total system performance assessment, based upon this design concept
and available scientific and technical data, which will integrate and analyze design and site
characteristics and describe the probable behavior of the repository.
<p>
<i>Third,</i> we will develop a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a
license application.
<p>
<i>And finally,</i> we will estimate the cost to construct and operate the repository.
<p>
Key repository activities to be undertaken during the fiscal year to support the assessment include
the completion of the exploratory studies facility and the continuation of our core science work. 
In FY 1997, we will gain access to and begin to test the properties of the Ghost Dance Fault, and
initiate the drift-scale thermal test to investigate the coupling of thermal hydrologic, mechanical,
and chemical processes in the rock.  This will be our first large-scale test that will explore how
the rock will behave in the presence of waste packages.
<p>
In FY 1997, we plan to reinitiate our National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) activities to
support the preparation of the draft and final repository environmental impact statements in
FY 1999 and FY 2000, respectively.  Through a public rulemaking process, we will begin to
modify the Department of Energy's repository siting guidelines in support of the approach we are
now proposing.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation.</b>  The FY 1997 request for our waste
acceptance, storage and transportation activities is $10 million.  It will be used to continue the
administrative and coordination activities that we are responsible for under the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act and to support some progress on non-site-specific initiatives that will address the long
lead time activities that must precede removal of spent nuclear fuel from reactor sites once a
federal facility becomes available.
<p>
<b>Program Management.  </b>The FY 1997 request for program management is $51 million.  This
figure includes $2 million to maintain our quality assurance program, $10 million for human
resources and administration, $9 million for technical and regulatory integration and planning
activities, and $30 million for program direction (including Federal salaries).  Following
Congressional guidance for FY 1996, program management efforts have been reprioritized to
provide support for the completion of core scientific activities and conceptual designs for a
repository at Yucca Mountain, and for the development and implementation of strategies to
improve the program's capability to respond to Congressional direction regarding interim
storage.
<p>
The remainder of my statement reviews in more detail the progress we have made since your
hearing last year, the work we will accomplish during the remainder of FY 1996, and the work
we propose to do with the funds we are requesting for FY 1997.
<p>
		 <b>   1995-1996 ACCOMPLISHMENTS</b>
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.</b>  Since I testified before this Committee last March, we have made substantial
progress toward the characterization of the Yucca Mountain site.
<p>
<i>Waste Isolation Strategy. </i> We substantially refined our strategy for the containment and isolation
of radioactive wastes.  The strategy relies on engineered barriers, geologic features, and natural
processes to delay releases of radionuclides to the environment outside of the Yucca Mountain
site and to minimize any exposure to the public.  The strategy is based on the theory that
dissolution and transport of radionuclides would be restricted because of the limited amount of
water moving through the rocks in and around the repository.  In this strategy, a Yucca Mountain
repository would completely contain wastes within the engineered barriers for thousands of years
and minimize doses to the population living near the site for tens of thousands to hundreds of
thousands of years.
<p>
<i>Exploratory Studies Facility.</i>  By increasing the efficiency of tunnel boring machine operations
throughout the year, we made important progress constructing the exploratory studies facility. 
We have completed over one-half (almost three miles) of the planned excavation at Yucca
Mountain and are now tunneling through the proposed repository horizon, significantly ahead of
schedule.  We have passed the location of the first planned Ghost Dance Fault alcove.  We are
making every effort within limits of available funds to continue the progress on the tunnel and
the scientific work associated with it.  Four test alcoves have been excavated to provide scientists
with direct access to the repository setting where they can observe and test major geologic and
hydrologic features of the Yucca Mountain site, and study the geomechanical properties of its
rock and its response to construction activities in the proposed repository setting.  We have
completed construction of the North Portal and have begun excavation of the thermal test alcove. 
<p>
<i>Core Science.</i>  We have appreciably reduced the scientific and technical uncertainty surrounding
the proposed repository site through the analysis of the scientific data we have collected.  Our
results continue to confirm that, consistent with our waste isolation and containment strategy, the
natural system at the site would contribute significantly to waste isolation.
<p>
 <ul>
<li> The rock at the repository level is more competent than had been anticipated.
<li>  The rock is even drier than expected, with no dripping or flowing water.
<li>  Our investigations reveal some indications that ground water flow at the repository horizon  has been very limited for 100,000 years or longer.
<li>   We have found no unexpected geologic features, such as major new faults.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, we found that the Drill Hole Wash structure, identified at the surface as a fault
several tens of meters wide, is a less significant feature at repository depth than expected.  These
observations led to elimination of the need for one planned test alcove, and raises the possibility
that a substantially larger area is available for the repository than was originally assumed.
<p>
<i>Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Performance.</i>  The efficiency of the underground tunneling
operation has been greatly increased.  Installation of a muck conveyor system in July 1995
allowed us to replace the muck cars used to remove excavated rock during the early phase of
tunnel construction.  The conveyor system has reduced by 30 to 50 percent the time required to
complete the excavation cycle.  In addition, we implemented modifications to the TBM's
steering, hydraulics, gripping capability and cutter head to improve TBM efficiencies.  In
combination with an aggressive management strategy that consolidates outages and minimizes
TBM downtime, the rate of progress has been greatly improved.  Consequently, we have reduced
the cost of construction significantly.
<p>
<i>Performance Assessment.</i>  We completed a performance assessment of the repository system as
we currently envision it.  The performance assessment evaluates the ability of the natural and
engineered barrier systems to meet repository performance objectives.  It indicated that the
man-made features of the repository could provide containment for spent nuclear fuel and
high-level
radioactive waste.
<p>
The results also indicate that, under certain assumptions, the natural processes alone can
contribute to isolation of the radionuclides for a very long time-period.  The analyses tend to
confirm our understanding of the importance of the rate and distribution of ground-water
movement to the performance of the natural system.  A combination of waste package and site
performance can be shown to contribute to containing and isolating radioactive waste within the
Yucca Mountain area for some tens of thousands to even hundreds of thousands of years.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Interactions.</i>  We provided a revised License Application Annotated Outline and
Topical Report II for Seismic Hazards Methodology to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  We
also closed with the Commission on the extreme erosion issue.
<p>
<i>Environmental Requirements.  </i>We completed the repository environmental impact statement
scoping process that will support our work under the National Environmental Policy Act.
<p>
<i>Surface-Based Testing.  </i>During FY 1995, we continued to collect information from our
surface-based testing activities, including data on the properties of the rock at-depth to support
design
and construction of the exploratory studies facility, data on the characteristics of water movement
in the unsaturated and saturated zones, and data relevant to the evaluation of the waste package 
environment.  We continued to monitor precipitation and meteorological conditions, infiltration
from precipitation events, streamflow and runoff, water levels in wells, and seismicity.  We
analyzed groundwater samples to assess their age and the characteristics of infiltration since
nuclear weapons testing began at the Nevada Test Site.  We continued our program to monitor
natural infiltration in unsaturated zone boreholes.  We also completed engineering reports to
identify the proposed repository configuration and we confirmed our understanding of the
geologic structure at the north end of the repository block.
 <p>
<i>Pneumatic Gas Flow.</i>  In response to concerns expressed by Nuclear Regulatory Commission
staff,  the State of Nevada, and Nye County, Nevada, we implemented a program to collect
information on the base-line characteristics of pneumatic gas flow in Yucca Mountain.  We
performed continuous pneumatic monitoring of selected boreholes before, during, and after
tunneling penetration of the non-welded unit of the Paintbrush Tuff.  Results indicate that the
Paintbrush Tuff non-welded unit, which overlies the formation in which the repository would be
constructed, acts as a partial barrier to gas flow.  This pneumatic data confirms the results from
hydrologic investigations, which indicate that the non-welded unit acts as a barrier to water
infiltrating through the overlying units and to divert it away from the repository horizon.  These
results will be utilized in modeling gas flow in a thermally perturbed repository as part of our
next performance assessment.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation.</b>  In preparation to move large quantities of
spent nuclear fuel, we have initiated non-site-specific contingency planning to respond to new
policy direction on interim storage.  Work includes the development of a waste acceptance and
national transportation strategy that relies on the private sector for implementation.  The strategy
would utilize commercially available transportation and storage equipment that has been certified
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Our contingency planning also includes the
development of a generic interim storage facility safety analysis to expedite facility licensing and
development time if a site is authorized.
<p>
We completed the packaging of spent fuel hardware for removal from pool storage at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory.   Six of the ten Class C waste packages were shipped for
disposal.
<p>
<i>Canister and Cask Development.  </i>A contract for the design and certification of a multi-purpose
canister system was issued to Westinghouse Government and Environmental Services Company
in April 1995.  The initial phase of the three-phase contract covered system design and the
preparation of  three safety analysis reports, the first of which was submitted to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in April 1996.  In addition, we completed the fabrication of an advanced
technology, high-capacity, legal-weight truck cask half-scale model and completed testing to
verify cask design analyses.  These casks are capable of transporting bare, or uncanistered, spent
fuel from reactors to a storage or disposal facility.  We completed transfer of the multi-purpose
canister environmental impact statement preparation to the Department of the Navy.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Interactions. </i> We submitted a formal report on burn-up credit to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for review.  Approval of the burn-up credit methodology will lead to
substantially more efficient transport and storage technologies.
<p>
<i>Environmental Requirements.</i>  We issued a multi-purpose canister system environmental impact
statement implementation plan; completed the scoping process for the multi-purpose canister
system environmental impact statement; and developed a preliminary draft multi-purpose
canister environmental impact statement.
<p>
<b>Program Management.</b>  We updated various program control documents such as the Systems
Engineering Management Plan, the Baseline Management Plan, and Test and Evaluation
Management Plan.  We have also issued and began the implementation of our first integrated,
programwide information management strategic plan as a first step toward streamlining and
better integrating our information services.  In September 1995, we revised the program baselines
to reflect the Program Approach and published an updated Total System Life Cycle Cost analysis
of the program.  We updated the Program Cost and Schedule Baselines, the Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management System Requirements Document, and the Program Work Breakdown
Structure.  We also developed a Quality Assurance Transition Plan.
<p>
<i>Human Resources and Business Management.</i>  We completed the consolidation of our major
program participants under the Management and Operating Contractor for better integration and
coordination.  We initiated a procurement for a consolidated technical support services contractor
to improve performance at a reduced level of funding.  We managed a major program revision to
respond to budget reductions (eliminating over 1,000 contractor positions).  We improved our
management systems to provide for more effective utilization of reduced funding and staff.  We
also established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Home Page on the
Internet, which has dramatically improved the public's access to programmatic information.
<p>
<i>Quality Assurance. </i> We completed the initial consolidation of program quality assurance
procedures and developed and implemented a Quality Assurance Transition Plan that
consolidates quality assurance audits.
<p>
	       <b>  REMAINING ACTIVITIES IN FY 1996</b>
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain. </b> Through the remainder of this fiscal year, we will continue tunneling the
exploratory studies facility and will also initiate the excavation of  two additional test alcoves to
complement the four already completed.  One new alcove will be used for conducting heater tests
to study the response of the ground water and rocks to heat that will be generated by the spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  The other new alcove will provide access near the
Ghost Dance Fault to study its hydrologic characteristics and to determine if it acts as a
preferential path of water flow through the repository.  If funding permits, we will complete the
main tunnel excavation at the repository level.
<p>
<i>Core Science.</i>  Attention will continue to be focused on the analysis and documentation of the
substantial amount of data collected to date.  Key models of natural processes, including those
for flow and transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones, will be documented and available
by the end of FY 1996.  This documentation will provide input for the design work and for the
next iteration of total system performance assessment that will support the repository viability
assessment.  Testing in the exploratory studies facility will focus on the hydrologic
characteristics of faults and contacts between different rock units above the repository level.  We
will penetrate and begin testing the Ghost Dance fault at the repository horizon to understand its
role in movement of groundwater through the repository.  We will prepare for the single element
thermal mechanical (heater) test to collect the data needed to determine the stability of
underground openings when subjected to the heat from waste packages.  This test should start
later this calendar year.  In addition, we will issue the repository waste isolation and containment
strategy.
<p>
Only a few surface-based tests were planned for FY 1996.  Those tests focus on the hypotheses in
our waste containment and isolation strategy.  Testing at the C-Well complex will continue to
generate data to characterize groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the saturated zone. 
Monitoring related to characterization of seismicity, meteorological conditions, pneumatic
pathways, and saturated and unsaturated zone hydrology will be continued.  Geologic mapping
will continue as the TBM advances towards completion of the tunnel.
<p>
<i>Repository Advanced Conceptual Design.</i>  We will issue advanced conceptual design reports for
the repository and waste package.  The reports will describe the design process; depict the major
repository configurations, components, and operational concepts; and identify those areas of
design requiring further refinement.  The reports will be prepared in sufficient detail to develop
confidence in the overall design of a repository that could be operated at Yucca Mountain, and to
serve as the basis for the viability assessment designs.
<p>
<i>Performance Assessment. </i> We will complete additional sensitivity analyses of the current
performance assessment to improve our evaluation of the significance to total system
performance of various components of the natural and engineered barriers.  These analyses,
together with the waste containment and isolation strategy, will be used to narrow the scope of
our site characterization and design work by identifying the additional important site and
design-related information required for performance assessments for the viability assessment and
potential licensing.
<p>
If funding is available, we will also initiate a phased peer review of the performance assessment
that will run through 1999.  The comments and recommendations available from each step of the
peer review will be incorporated as appropriate as the total system performance assessment is
developed for the viability assessment.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Process.</i>  We will propose revisions to the Department's Siting Guidelines (10 CFR
Part 960) to focus on the most important aspects of evaluating a single repository site.  Through a
public rulemaking, we will clarify and simplify the procedural aspects of the site characterization
process.  Our proposal will address the most important aspects of evaluating a single repository
site consistent with the Congressional guidance provided by the 1987 amendments to the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and with guidance provided during the FY 1996 appropriations
process.  The proposal will also focus on protecting worker and public health and safety and the
environment.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation.</b>  We will continue to collect utility data in
preparation for the acceptance of waste.  We will commence work on and publish a Notice of
Expression of Interest to begin public discussion of the market-driven initiative to create a
national spent nuclear fuel transportation capability.  The development and certification of
advanced technology, legal-weight truck casks will be phased out.  We plan to rely upon
commercially available technologies when the transportation of spent fuel begins.  We will
complete the first phase of Westinghouse multi-purpose canister contract for system design and
preparation of safety analysis reports, and then close out the contract.
<p>
<i>Environmental Requirements. </i> Since work on the development of the multi-purpose canister
system will not continue past the design phase, our work on the environmental impact statement
for the fabrication and deployment of multi-purpose canisters also has been terminated.  Argonne
National Laboratory, our support contractor for development of the environmental impact
statement, has completed the preliminary draft document, which will be available for future
reference. 
<p>
The Navy has decided that it will become the lead agency on an environmental impact statement
covering naval spent nuclear fuel.  The Navy's environmental impact statement will analyze a
container system that will provide for the management of greater than Class C low-level
radioactive waste.  The Department will participate as a cooperating agency.  Since all naval
spent fuel is shipped to and stored at Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, the evaluations will
be specific to that location.
<p>
<i>Dry Transfer System.</i>  We plan to demonstrate the spent fuel dry transfer capability and submit a
topical safety analysis report on its design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Over the last
few years, we have been working with the Electric Power Research Institute on the design of a
dry transfer system for spent nuclear fuel.  The system will enable the transfer of individual spent
fuel assemblies between conventional, top-loading casks and canister systems.
<p>
The Electric Power Research Institute delivered a final design report to the Department in
December 1995, and a draft Topical Safety Analysis Report was received on March 7, 1996.  We
plan to submit the topical report to Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff later this year for
review and acceptance.  We are currently negotiating an agreement with the Idaho Operations
Office of the Department's Office of Environmental Management regarding a cost-shared project
to fabricate and demonstrate the dry transfer system at the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory.  The system could assist the Department in meeting its near-term spent fuel
management commitments to the State of Idaho.  It could also benefit early operations at any
interim storage facility.  Our intent is to complete prototype fabrication and to start the
demonstration by mid-1998.
<p>
<b>Program Management.</b>  In FY 1996 we will complete our revision to the 1994 Program Plan. 
The revised plan will set forth the revised program strategy, work scope, major milestones, and
schedules in accordance with direction provided with the FY 1996 appropriation.
<p>
<i>Program Integration. </i> Through the remainder of FY 1996, we will continue to improve the
integration of program activities by:  (1) awarding a new integrated technical and management
support contract which will consolidate existing contracts for support of the Federal staff at both
business centers and the management center; (2) consolidating program participant quality
assurance procedures; (3) updating contractual reporting requirements; and (4) implementing a
single, integrated program planning and control system.  In addition, the program will be
managed as one integrated, strategic system in response to the Secretary's new initiative to
strengthen the Department's project management system.
<p>
<i>Defense Waste Fee. </i> In the near future, we will complete and issue the Defense Waste Fee
Adequacy Report, which is used to determine an appropriate defense contribution to the
development of the radioactive waste management systems for the disposal of high-level
radioactive waste.  The fee is based on an our updated estimate of the systems's total life cycle
cost.
<p>
	  <b>  APPLICATION OF THE FY 1997 BUDGET REQUEST</b>
<p>
The budget request for FY 1997 underscores the Administration's continued commitment to
geologic disposal.  The funds requested will allow us to resolve the technical questions
concerning the viability of the construction and operation of a repository at Yucca Mountain by
1998; regain a target of 2002 to file a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for construction of the repository; and develop the strategies and establish the
capability to quickly respond to new policy directions on interim storage.
<p>
The overall FY 1997 budget request for the program is $400 million, which consists of a $200
million appropriation from the Nuclear Waste Disposal Fund and a $200 million appropriation
for Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal Activities.  This represents an effective increase of $85
million over the amount available to us from the FY 1996 Appropriation of $315 million.
<p>
<b>Yucca Mountain.</b>  The FY 1997 budget request for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project is $339 million, compared to $250 million in FY 1996.  This represents an increase of 
$89 million, more than the total program funding increase we are requesting.
<p>
The FY 1997 funding will be applied most heavily toward work on the critical elements of the
repository evaluation, including the development of an updated total system performance
assessment; design of the repository and waste package in sufficient detail to evaluate its
feasibility and performance; resolution of critical unresolved issues in the waste isolation
strategy, criticality control, and thermal loading; development of site investigation synthesis
reports and updated process models; completion of the excavation for the exploratory studies
facility; and collection of required test data.
<p>
In FY 1997, we will also continue work on updating the regulatory requirements that govern the
repository licensing process and considering the regulatory revisions that would be needed to
clarify our intentions.  The existing regulations were established more than a decade ago and in
different policy and technical settings that exist today.  Since their initial promulgation, an
enormous amount of data has been collected and analyzed at Yucca Mountain.  From that data,
we have gained a more coherent understanding of what is required to complete a technically
defensible license application.  A more directed approach to licensing would allow us to set the
target date for a license application in 2002, given a sustainable level of program funding.
<p>
<i>Operations and Construction.</i>  Operations and construction includes excavation within the
exploratory studies facility; tunnel boring machine operations and maintenance; and the Project's
safety and health program.
<p>
During FY 1997, we will complete the underground five mile exploratory studies facility loop
and the second alcove to provide access to the Ghost Dance fault at the south end.  The
completed loop will allow testing and evaluation of the geology and hydrology of the southern
portion of the proposed repository.  We will complete excavation of the heater test alcove.  We
will construct limited facilities at the north and south portal to support construction and operation
of the exploratory studies facility.  Boreholes will be drilled to provide data for the design of an
east-west drift, if one is needed, and to improve our understanding of the distribution of rock
units and faults in this area.  We will procure contractor support and equipment for construction
of smaller scale drifts at the repository horizon, if necessary. Underground and on-site safety
services will be provided for construction activities as well as environmental management of
hazardous waste accumulation facilities, hydrocarbon contaminated soil maintenance and
disposal, and conducting surveillance of site activities to ensure compliance with environmental
regulations and requirements.  Emergency medical services and fire prevention programs will be
maintained to support field activities.
<p>
<i>Core Science.</i>  Core Science includes scientific test planning and design; collection of scientific
and environmental data; laboratory experiments; site and materials performance testing; and
modeling and data analysis.  These activities are intended to support preparation of the Yucca
Mountain viability assessment, and assuming a positive assessment, a future site
recommendation, NEPA determination, and licensing documentation.
<p>
During FY 1997, additional data collection activities will focus on gaining a better understanding
of the repository's waste containment and isolation capabilities.  This data will be used to
constrain and evaluate flow models for the site.  Additional boreholes will be drilled to provide
information on rock properties, deep stratigraphy and saturated zone to support three dimensional
geologic, hydrologic, tectonic, and volcanism modeling efforts.  Saturated hydrologic zone
testing will be conducted to investigate water movement across faults, to complete tracer tests at
the C-wells, and to study the deep aquifers downstream from the repository block.
<p>
Seismic, stream flow, pneumatic, and meteorological data will be collected to record transient
events such as earthquakes, floods, and major storms.  Additional aquifer tests will be conducted
to characterize the steep hydraulic gradient at the north end of the repository block as input into
the regional saturated zone hydrologic model.   Hydrologic testing in the first Ghost Dance fault
alcove will be initiated to observe potential groundwater flow paths through or past the
repository horizon.  This will provide data crucial to the issue of fast flow paths through the
unsaturated zone.  Hydrologic testing will continue in alcove No. 2 (Bow Ridge Fault) and
alcoves Nos. 3 and 4 (upper and lower contact boundaries of the Paintbrush Tuff non-welded
formation) to study water movement above the repository horizon.  The drift scale heater test will
be installed and the heaters turned on during FY 1997.  The drift scale heater test will be
designed to approximate an actual emplacement drift.  Thermal, hydrologic, geochemical, and
geomechanical parameters will be monitored during the test and data will be used to evaluate
potential impacts on the near field environment.
 <p>
<i>Design and Engineering.</i>  Design and Engineering activities include the coordination and
planning of exploratory studies facility, repository and waste package designs, including waste
form and package modeling; performance testing; quality assurance oversight and training; and
the preparation of program cost estimates.
<p>
During FY 1997, selected aspects of the waste package, surface, and subsurface designs will be
advanced to resolve key issues that will allow us to demonstrate in 1998 that the construction,
operation, and closure of the repository are technically feasible.  The design information we
compile over the next few years will also be the basis for our assessment of the expected
performance of the system in terms of radiological safety and waste isolation.  Outputs of this
design phase will also support the evaluation of the additional design work that may be needed to
support our license application for construction of a repository and the preparation of an updated
cost estimate for construction and operation of a repository.  Waste package enhancements will
include work in fabrication development, probabilistic criticality analysis, materials, and waste
form testing.
<p>
In FY 97, we will also complete the Thermal Loading System Study.  The study will provide the
technical basis to support the decision of how much heat-generating waste can be disposed of in
a given repository area.  The study will evaluate performance, cost and schedule of the thermal
management options.  The study will also indicate how thermal loading flexibility can be
achieved and when decisions must be made so that significant costs or schedule constraints are
not incurred.
<p>
<i>Performance Assessment.</i>  Performance assessment includes the calculations and modeling
associated with total system and subsystem performance analysis; and management and control
of the supporting technical databases.
<p>
Our next assessment of system performance, which is being scheduled for the 1997-1998
time-frame, will be based more directly on the process-level models that we are developing for
the site
and engineered system.  A more sophisticated biosphere model is also expected to be in place to
allow calculation of dose and the associated risk to a representative individual in an affected
population.  The objective for this assessment is to evaluate both the expected performance of the
system as well as the ranges of probabilities of radiation release, dose, and resulting
consequences.
<p>
The 1997-1998 assessment will consider and reflect the site and engineered system process-level
understanding and data available at that time.  It will, therefore, represent the best estimate of
system performance that we are likely to have for some time to come.
<p>
<i>Regulatory Process.</i>  We will reinitiate support activities to regain our target to file a license
application in 2002.  We will issue a final rule revising the repository siting guidelines (10 CFR
Part 960).
<p>
<i>NEPA Compliance. </i> Compliance activities primarily consist of holding scoping meetings;
reviewing and responding to public scoping comments; completion of data gathering;
maintaining technical interfaces; consultations with other agencies and Native American Indian
Tribes; and modeling and impact analysis, all of which would lead to development and issuance
of a draft repository environmental impact statement.  These activities would also be conducted
for the final environmental impact statement (including a public comment response document)
and a Record of Decision.
<p>
Related NEPA activities were suspended in FY 1996.  We will reinitiate them in FY 1997 with
the award of a technical support contract to collect, interpret, and analyze data required for the
preparation and review of the draft and final repository environmental impact statements,
scheduled for completion in FY 1999 and FY 2000 respectively.  In FY 1997, we will also begin
to address NEPA information needs through data collected from our core science, design and
engineering, and performance assessment activities.
<p>
<i>Project Management.</i>  The objective of Project management is to provide the requisite level of
Project control and support at minimum cost to assure that the maximum amount of funds are
available for core science, design and engineering, performance assessment, and NEPA
compliance activities.  Project management includes the planning, budgeting, scheduling and
funds management of all Project activities, facilities operation, site security, administrative
support services, telecommunications and rent payments; records management and computer
procurement, maintenance and operation; operation of local and wide area communication
networks; motor pool operations; and to conduct public information and outreach activities.
<p>
<b>Waste Acceptance Storage and Transportation.</b>  The FY 1997 budget request for Waste
Acceptance, Storage and Transportation is $10.0 million, compared to $13.6 million in FY 1996. 
This category includes five line items from the Congressional Budget submission: Spent Fuel
Storage, Transportation, Waste Acceptance, Multi-Purpose Canister subsystem, and Project
Integration.  The request for Spent Fuel Storage is $2.3 million, compared to $1.0 million in FY
1996; Transportation is $2.5 million, compared to $5.1 million in FY 1996; Waste Acceptance is
$2.7 million, compared to $2.3 million; Multi-Purpose Canister subsystem will be terminated in
FY 1996; and the request for Project Integration is $2.4 million, compared to $3.4 million in FY
1996.
<p>
In FY 1997, the Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation Project will forge a
market-driven waste acceptance and national transportation strategy, and will address the
non-site-specific and long-lead time activities that must precede any near term removal of spent
nuclear
fuel from reactor sites once a Federal facility becomes available.
<p>
<i>Market-Driven Waste Acceptance and Transportation Strategy.</i>  In FY 1997, we plan to begin
discussions with industry on an initiative to create the necessary national transportation capability
to remove spent nuclear fuel from locations throughout the United States to a centralized interim
storage or permanent disposal facility.  An acquisition strategy that relies on the private sector for
transportation and waste acceptance equipment and services will be developed.  We will solicit
Expressions of Interest in one or more publications such as the  <i>Federal Register, Commerce
Business Daily</i>, and trade journals to garner industry and vendor views on the proposed strategy. 
Under this approach, we will be prepared to issue requests for proposals and award fixed-price,
multi-year, performance-based contracts to the private sector for equipment and services to carry
out certain functions under the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or
High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part 961), to accept spent fuel at utility sites for delivery
to a Federal facility, and to provide the technical and management capability to maintain a
National transportation effort.
<p>
<i>Non-Site-Specific and Long Lead Time Work.</i>  Our non-site-specific work related to storage will
continue in FY 1996 and FY 1997.  We will maintain our standard contracts and interactions
with utilities, continue the collection of utility data, establish the sequence and amounts of spent
fuel to be transferred to the Department, and review utility reports that identify assemblies to be
picked up.  "Long lead time" activities that must precede acceptance, and subsequent shipment,
of spent nuclear fuel from reactor sites will be addressed.  We will integrate Federal spent
nuclear fuel and defense high-level radioactive waste into the program's plans for waste
acceptance, storage, and transportation; and complete a memorandum of agreement with the
Department's Office of Environmental Management to establish the process for determining the
type, quantity, priority, and fee for their spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
Our interim storage readiness capability will be based upon a phased interim storage facility
consistent with the concept developed in Congressional debate.  We will address the technical,
safety, and procedural issues involved in licensing an interim storage facility to expedite the
process and reduce the cost for facility development when an interim storage site is designated. 
An example of this type of activity is a generic topical safety analysis report for the interim
storage facility that should resolve issues and thereby expedite the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission licensing schedule when a specific site is identified.
<p>
<b>Program Management. </b> The FY 1997 budget request for Program Management is $50.7
million, compared to $51.4 million in FY 1996.  This funding includes $1.9 million for Quality
Assurance, $8.1 million for Program Management and Integration, $10.2 million for Human
Resources and Administration, and $30.5 for Program Direction which includes Federal salaries
and administrative support.  The Program Management and Integration component is about 12.6
percent of the total program budget for the year, down from 16.3 percent in FY 1996, and 17.3
percent in FY 1995.  This reflects our continuing efforts to reduce these costs and make a greater
share of our funding available to our two business centers.
<p>
Program Management consists of activities and tasks that support all of the program element
areas.  From an organizational perspective, Program Management elements include the
traditional areas of management and control, quality assurance, systems integration, regulatory
integration, human resources and administration, and Federal salaries.  These elements provide
administrative support and strategic planning for, as well as cross-cutting issues affecting both
the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization and Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation
Projects.
<p>
In FY 1997, an emphasis will be placed on increasing the capability of Federal staff  to function
with a decreasing reliance on contractor support; improving the program's management tools
(e.g., schedules, baselines, change control, performance review, and reporting processes) to
increase the efficiency of applying reduced funding levels to program priorities both in planning
and in operations; addressing a number of cross-cutting technical issues; improving the
functional linkages across the program through increased integration; and improving access to
the data and information needed to effectively manage the program.
<p>
Our quality assurance activities will continue to support the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization effort, repository design, and the revisions to our technical baselines.  Our
systems integration work will ensure that the interface requirements between the repository and
the interim storage and transportation components of the radioactive waste management system
are adequately addressed and alternative system design proposals are prepared and evaluated.  As
progress is made in site characterization, repository design activities, and transportation and
interim storage efforts, the latest concepts will be incorporated into system operation studies and
models.  These will be used to evaluate the impact of repository design and operational concepts
on the overall waste system.  System cost tradeoffs, waste logistics, and storage options will also
be examined.
<p>
With regard to regulatory integration, we will coordinate and participate in interactions with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff to address management and technical issues related to the
repository program, interim storage, and the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste.  Our planning activities will focus on responding to Administration and
Congressional inquiries regarding program status, policies, and updating the program's policies
and plans.  We will complete the FY 1997 total system life cycle cost report and conduct an FY
1997 Defense Waste Fee Adequacy Analysis and publish the report.  We will also continue to
improve program and project management systems by updating program and project cost and
schedule baselines, schedule networks, and bases of estimates.  In the area of  Human Resources
and Administration, in early FY 1997, we will award a contract for a consolidated technical
support services contractor to improve performance at  reduced funding levels.  We will also
update our quality assurance training course outlines, instruction guides, and lesson plans and
conduct essential quality assurance training; develop and submit the program's annual report to
Congress on FY 1996 activities and expenditures; develop and submit an audited financial
statement for Nuclear Waste Fund management; and continue to integrate information
management activities across program locations.
<p>
		<b> SPECIAL BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS</b>
<p>
<b>Payments to State of Nevada and Units of Local Government.</b>  We do not intend to make FY
1996 payments to the State of Nevada and the units of local government affected by the Yucca
Mountain site characterization project under the provisions of Section 116(c) of the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act (the Act).
<p>
However, as we have informally advised your staff, we do intend to enter into an agreement,
under other authority, with Nye County to perform on-site testing and data gathering activities
that we believe are important to our ongoing characterization efforts.  Maintenance of the
continuity of this scientific work during FY 1996 is important to our program.  The cost of this
work will be approximately $631,000.
<p>
We believe that the support envisioned by Section 116(c) of the Act to the State and units of
local government affected by site characterization activities is important in enabling local
governments and the citizens most directly impacted by the Yucca Mountain Project to remain
informed and to participate in a meaningful way in the day to day program actions that affect
them.  Financial support is particularly important for the rural counties' programs where financial
resources are severely limited.
<p>
We hope to resolve the policy regarding the future funding of the affected governments in the
course of consideration of the FY 1997 budget.
<p>
<b>Cooperative Agreements. </b> The program funds ten formal cooperative agreements with regional,
national and technical organizations to address institutional and technical issues relating to the
transportation, storage, and disposal of commercial spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
Public participation and the exchange of valuable information is facilitated through these
agreements.  Due to budget reductions in FY 1996, we reviewed each of the agreements and
funding for each organization was reduced to about one-third of the FY 1995 level.  Our plan for
FY 1997 is to continue to fund these organizations at these reduced levels.  I am submitting for
the record a table that presents the funding provided to each organization in FY 1995 and FY
1996, and the planned FY 1997 level.
<p>
<b>Dry Storage Research.</b>  The Department maintains spent nuclear fuel in storage casks at the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.  This spent fuel has been in dry storage longer than any
other fuel in this country.  The casks are routinely monitored to provide information regarding
the behavior of the spent fuel in storage and could provide valuable information for licensing by
the Commission of extended dry storage.  This work has historically been funded from the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Research and Development Appropriation.  The FY 1996
appropriation did not provide funds to continue this activity and we are not requesting an
appropriation for FY 1997.  We have asked the Department's Office of Environmental
Management staff to consider taking over this project, and remain hopeful that this important
data series can be maintained.
<p>
		       <b> CONCLUDING REMARKS</b>
<p>
With your approval of our FY 1997 budget request, I am confident that the direction we are now
taking will, in the FY 1998 - FY 1999 time frame, answer the important outstanding technical
questions regarding the feasibility of building the repository.
<p>
If there is an aspect of the geologic setting that seriously contradicts our expectations about the
performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain, we are likely to discover it by FY 1998 -
FY 1999.  If there are shortcomings in the available technologies or in our engineering ability to
implement the repository design concepts, they will be evident by then.  With adequate funding
and an updated regulatory process for repository licensing, I am also confident that we can regain
a target date of 2002 for the submittal of a competent license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.  The level of funding that we are requesting for FY 1997 will enable us
to embark upon a program with that objective.
<p>
Also, I believe that the concepts that we are developing in FY 1997 for a national transportation
system and an interim storage facility are consistent with the policies expressed by the Congress
and that they will result in the most efficient path forward.
<p>
As we reduce the remaining scientific and technical uncertainties concerning geologic disposal at
Yucca Mountain, society's ability to evaluate the geologic disposal option will become much less
philosophical and much more practical.  It will become very clear by FY 1998 - FY 1999 how the
geologic disposal option compares to alternatives for the long-term management of spent fuel
and other high-level waste forms.  We believe that the responsible course of action is to place the
near-term priority upon completion of the work necessary for a sound assessment of the viability
of the geologic repository.  With that information, we will be able to make a reasoned decision
on the best approach to interim storage in a way that is objective and fair to all our citizens.
<p>
Thank you for your attention.
