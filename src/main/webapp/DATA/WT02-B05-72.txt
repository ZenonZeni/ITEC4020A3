(1) COURT GRANTS INJUNCTION ON CDA; UNANIMOUS DECISION IS A MAJOR VICTORY
    FOR FREE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET!

At 9:00 am this morning (6/12), a three-judge panel of federal judges
in Philadelphia, PA granted CIEC's request for a preliminary injunction
against the Communications Decency Act (CDA).   In a unanimous decision, 
the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on
the Internet.

This is a major victory for Netizens!  The ruling today soundly rejects
Congressional attempts to censor the Internet.  However, the government 
will most certainly appeal this case to the Supreme Court, so the battle
against the CDA is not over yet.  All Internet users are encouraged to 
join the fight against the CDA as the case moves to the Supreme Court.

Excerpts from the decision:

     "As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the
      Internet deserves the highest protection from government intrusion."

     "Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of 
      our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered
      speech the First Amendment protects."

The full text of the decision, including a compressed downloadable version,
as well as information on how to join the CIEC, is available at the CIEC web
page:

     http://www.cdt.org/ciec/ 

More information about the decision, including analysis of the 175-page 
opinion, will be posted over the next few days.

DECISION IN INTERNET CHALLENGE HAILED AS VICTORY FOR PARENTS, CHILDREN
AND AMERICAN TRADITION OF FREE SPEECH 

PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania -- Parents, librarians, online companies, 
publishers, newspaper reporters and others challenging government 
censorship of cyberspace today hailed an historic decision by a 
federal court enjoining the government from enforcing portions of a
new law which violate constitutionally protected free speech.  

But plaintiffs in the American Library Association v. U.S. Department
of Justice suit warned that the battle against the Communications 
Decency Act may not be over if the government appeals today's decision
to the Supreme Court. 

"This is a victory for the Internet and for everyone who values free
speech," said Jerry Berman of the Center for Democracy and Technology
and a co-founder of the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition that
organized the suit. 

In their 175-page decision, the three judge panel of the U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvnia found the law 
unconstitutional on grounds that it violated rights of free speech. All
three judges -- Dolores K. Sloviter, chief judge of the U.S. Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals, and U.S. District Judges Ronald L. Buckwalter
and Stewart Dalzell wrote individual opinions supporting the panel's 
unanimous decision to enforce an injunction against the government.

"Our findings of fact -- many of them undisputed -- express our 
understanding of the Internet.  These Findings lead to the conclusion
that Congress may not regulate indecency on the Internet at all," wrote
Judge Dalzell, referring to the extensive study of the Internet.  

The Judges concluded: the "plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no
party has any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law, and
therefore the public interest will be served by granting a preliminary
injunction."

The 27 plaintiffs in the case, which was joined by the court with another
suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, complained that the law
imposed criminal penalities on speech in cyberspace that is otherwise 
entirely lawful.  It was the first time in American history that criminal
penalities had been placed on the exercise of free speech. 

The result of the unconstitutional law was that books legal on library 
shelves could land a librarian in jail if posted on-line. The terms used
in the law were so vague that they encompassed vast amounts of material 
with literary, artistic, political, cultural and medical value, and 
threatened to penalize people who did not realize they were violating a law.

The law was not aimed at curbing obscenity or child pornography on the 
Internet, which already are against the law. 

"We are ecstatic. Librarians can continue to provide ideas and information
to the public regardless of the format, without concern about fines or jail
terms," said Judith Krug from the American Library Association. "This is 
victory for anyone who uses the public libraries."

In addition, the law would fail in its goal of protecting children since 
large amounts of material on the Internet originate overseas, beyond the 
reach of U.S. law. 

During five days of hearings, plaintiffs showed the court the unique nature
of the new medium and demonstrated software that allows parents to easily
monitor and control the material coming into homes and schools. Plaintiffs
argued that such technology was more effective than any law, empowered users
to make their own judgements about what they wanted to see and protected
Americans' First Amendment rights to free expression. 

"The court today did for children and adults what Congress did not -- It
decided that parental control tools combined with user education and
enforcement of existing laws is a more effective and constitutional way to
protect children and safeguard our freedoms," said Bill Burrington, Assistant
General Counsel of America Online.

Other countries were watching the outcome of the case closely. Many nations,
such as Germany, France and Japan, are just beginning to grapple with
Internet issues. Other nations, such as China and Saudi Arabia, already have
imposed strict controls on the medium, which Judge Dalzell referred to during
the hearings as "the most democratic medium yet devised by the imagination of
man." 

"This court is the first to fully grapple with and grasp the unique nature 
and potential of the Internet. The court's decision today to afford 
communications over the Internet heightened protections recognizes the value
of this new medium in a democracy," said Bruce J. Ennis, lead attorney in the
case. "This decision will help define the legal framework for future decision
related to the Internet."

The plaintiffs in the case include: American Library Association, Inc.;
America Online, Inc.; American Booksellers Association, Inc.; American 
Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression; American Society of Newspaper
Editors; Apple Computer, Inc.; Association of American Publishers, Inc.;
Association of Publishers, Editors and Writers; Commercial Internet eXchange
Association; CompuServe Incorporated; Families Against Internet Censorship;
Freedom to Read Foundation, Inc.; Health Sciences Libraries Consortium;
HotWired Ventures LLC; Interactive Digital Software Association; Interactive
Services Association; Magazine Publishers of America, Inc.; Microsoft
