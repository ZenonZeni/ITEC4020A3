DANGER OF FRAGMENTATION AS ICAO RETAINS NOISE RULES

     An international environmental group's proposal to maintain
Chapter 3 noise limits for now and impose only slight changes in
aircraft emissions regulations could spur individual countries,
regions and airports to implement their own rules governing aircraft
environmental issues, making the situation more complicated than it is
today.
     Strengthening aircraft noise rules might have driven down the
value of older aircraft. Many airlines have already spent large sums
to hushkit older aircraft to meet Chapter 3 requirements, which will
be mandatory as of Jan. 1, 1997.
     Instead, the group's decision to retain Chapter 3 limits on
aircraft noise appears to provide welcome relief for airlines.
Increasing the stringency of noise rules would have impacted the
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series and Boeing 737 series. 
     The absence of any change in noise rules and only a modest
reduction in emissions provides comfort for used aircraft values. But
it is only superficial. Airlines will be allowed to continue operating
their Stage 3 equipment until well into the next century but the
threat of restriction has not passed. Over the course of the next year
it will be vital to monitor the progress of the EC in formulating non-
addition rules on both noise and emissions. 
     The International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) Committee
on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/3), meeting December 5-15
in Montreal, recommended that the present Annex 16, Chapter 3,
relating to aircraft noise limits, be retained for the foreseeable
future. The group also asked the ICAO's full council to accept a
proposal reducing aircraft NOx levels by 15-16%. 
     Compared to the proposed measures, the group's decisions on noise
and emissions represent the most lenient increases that could have
been anticipated. But rather than settling these issues, its decisions
could result in a fragmentation of policy, with regions and countries
introducing their own measures, providing confusion rather than
clarification.
     The U.S. and European Commission sought to support their own
interests, making the Montreal meeting an intensely political affair.
The EC was anxious to increase limits on noise since stricter rules
may have increased the retirement rate of older and predominantly
U.S.- manufactured aircraft, giving European manufacturers business
opportunities as airlines sought replacement aircraft. Not
surprisingly, the U.S. position in Montreal highlighted the cost of
implementing additional noise restrictions, particularly in terms of
lower aircraft values.
     The lack of agreement on the retention of Chapter 3 noise levels
may not provide the status quo that the U.S. and others had sought,
however. The failure to compromise may allow both camps to pursue
their own objectives.
     The lack of any agreement on noise as opposed to a compromise,
may spur Europe to pursue its own policy without having to take
account of supra-national recommendations. The EC can be expected to
push for further non-addition rules sooner rather than later. The
primary targets will be the MD-80 series and hushkitted aircraft whose
emissions, even after modification, are seen as falling outside the
EC's minimum standards. 
     A 3 decibel reduction of the sideline measurement compared to the
present Chapter 3 rules will also impact a significant number of
widebodies unless bypass ratio engines of greater than two are once
again exempted. 
     Should the EC proceed with a non-addition rule, some response
from the U.S. must be expected.
     The lack of any ICAO recommendation on noise increases the
likelihood that airports will pursue their own individual policies
involving a plethora of different restrictions. The absence of
"Chapter 4" may make it easier for the airframe and engine
manufacturers to produce the next series of large widebodies, but with
older aircraft being allowed to remain in service for that much
longer, new sales may be impacted. 
     CAEP/3's proposal to lower NOx levels follows the 20% reduction
in NOx agreed to by ICAO in the early 1990s when the EC was pressing
for a 40% cut. 
     The NOx proposal reflects the current level of technology and
applies to newly certificated engines as of Dec. 31, 1999 and
production engines as of Dec. 31, 2007. The airframe/engine
combinations apparently impacted by the recommendation include the Tay
650 on the Fokker 100, the PW2040 on the 757, the CFM56-5B1 and -5B2
on the A321, and the PW4168 and Trent 768 on the A330. But as the cut-
off point is some 11 years away, manufacturers will have ample time to
introduce the required marginal improvement in NOx emissions, although
a non-addition rule imposed by EC countries will make it difficult for
the manufacturers to plan ahead. 
     There remains considerable concern about the impact of aircraft
emissions on the environment and with research still being undertaken,
the cautious approach of ICAO seems justified. 
     The NOx decision was a compromise favoring the U.S. lobby, passed
by a 10-4 majority. Since CAEP/3 did not agree unanimously there is
every indication that the ICAO council will reject the recommendation,
thereby retaining the status quo. In the event ICAO fails to adopt the
recommendation, this again will allow the EC to pursue its own policy
with a non-addition rule also expected to be adopted. 
     Recommendations of CAEP/3 require approval by the ICAO Council
before they can take effect.

BOEING RETURN TO WORK DAMPENS SURGE IN USED VALUES

     The return to work by Boeing machinists last month after a 10-
week strike was a relief to customers, but for owners of used aircraft
there was a measure of disappointment. 
     The lack of new availability was beginning to raise values for
some used aircraft by an appreciable amount. The prospect of further
rises in used values were impacted by Boeing's announcement that it
intends to increase production rates to compensate for the strike and
accommodate additional demand. Boeing has, however, instructed its
suppliers to reduce production rates to avoid oversupply of
components. 
     By the end of the first quarter of 1996, Boeing expects
production to be at pre-strike levels and in the fourth quarter
production of the 737 will increase from seven to eight and a half
units per month. This reverses a previously announced plan to reduce
737 production to five per month as of April 1996. Production of the
747 will rise from two to three and a half per month also by the
fourth quarter of 1996 and the 767 will increase from three and a half
to four units per month at the same time. The 777 will seen an
increase from three and a half units per month to five units in early
1997. The reduction in the production of the 757 from four to three
units will be delayed from June to September 1996. The changes in
production are relatively modest and reflect a spate of recent orders.
     China Airlines has become the latest customer for the new 737,
ordering six -800s with options for an additional nine. Boeing values
the order and options at $750 million, or nearly $47 million per
aircraft, which equates to the list price. A total of 220 orders have
now been placed for the new generation 737.
