Topic on Hepatitis B Virus<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A topic I introduce today is a new matter of Hepatitis B Virus. Professor K.Murakami of Kanazawa University, Cancer Center, in Japan, reported the relationship between X protein and some transcription factor, that was a first finding and very interesting. 
As you know, Hepatitis B Virus has gene X in its own genome and when this virus is infected to human or chimpanzee hepatocytes, protein X is usually expressed in the cells. However, the function of protein X has never been elucidated for a long time. He has challenged to produce protein X and MW800K protein derived from hepatocytes by E.coli expression system and confirmed them to be associated. Especially, protein X was found to bind specifically to RPB5 protein of some kinds of transcription factors. Furthermore, he expected this protein X and RPB5 protein complex might activate some genes related hepatocellular carcinoma. This news was derived from Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun(Jan.19,1995) and later I will confirm the content of this new result. Any way, the story of protein X and some transcription factor binding seems to be likely. If it is, we will be able to make a assay system for screening of binding inhibitors for cancer prevention. In Japan 24000 persons lost their lives due to hepatoma in 1994, and 20-30% of them was caused by Hepatitis B virus infection. Further studies have to be done.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
