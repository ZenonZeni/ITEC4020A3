<p><font size=4><strong>LABORATORY
RESEARCH</strong></font></p> <blockquote> <p><font size=3>The tools of
molecular genetics, i.e. modern DNA technology and linkage analysis as
well as examinations of clinical, biobehavioral and genetic markers
for behaviors, are used in the pursuit of information about brain
disorders. The first step toward pinpointing a disease locus on a
narrow region of a chromosome is to identify family groups in which
the prevalence of a particular disease is high. Histories are then
taken and blood samples are collected. From there, mathematical
analyses determine the likelihood that sophisticatedphysical mapping
techniques and sequencing work will yield specific information about
the disease gene. By these means, Psychiatric Institute scientists are
steadily making contributions to the major U.S. effort called the
Human Genome Project. <br> <br> Scientists in neurobiology and
behavior, located in twelve independent laboratories, are working to
provide analyses of neural development, behavior, learning and
diseases of the nervous system in terms of their underlying cellular
and molecular mechanisms. Researchers have made seminal discoveries
about learning and long and short term memory from the study of the
marine snail, Aplysia. They are now examining genetically altered
mice, making it possible to relate the action of known genes to the
physiology of specific cells in regions of the brain. <br> <br> Brain
imaging has become an essential tool in psychiatric research. Much has
been learned about how and where neurotransmitters, the chemical
messengers in the brain, convey information. Variations of intensity
of activity, interruption of transmission, depletion of specific
chemicals or changes in brain structure may be clues to disordered
states. Brain imaging is now being used in many studies at the
Institute, such as those relating to suicide and aggression, aging and
memory, and schizophria. <br> </font></p> </blockquote> <p><font

<p><font size=3>Epidemiological studies reveal much about the
prevalence of disease in certain populations. Surveys are being
conducted by Psychiatric Institute epidemiologists to determine the
prevalence of major depression, panic disorder and the social and
psychological factors involved in adversity and stress, for example.
What is the incidence of mental illness in the homeless in New York
City? What is the nature and extent of mental health problems in low
income populations? Which children will have need of special education
services? What brain disorders present at birth or arising early in
childhood will have effects on mood, behavior or cognition later on?
These are just a few of the questions being asked at Psychiatric
Institute. <br> <br> Scientists need standardized tools to conduct the
interviews which will achieve a diagnostic consensus of
psychopathology. Many of the most effective diagnostic interview
schedules used in countries all over the world have been developed at
Psychiatric Institute. These include the SADS (Schedule for Affective
Disorders and Schizophrenia), the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-III, DSM-III-R and DSM-IV), the DISC (Diagnostic Interview
Schedule for Children) and the GAS (Global Assessment Scale).
Psychiatric Institute researchers, known for their work on the
official diagnostic manuals of the American Psychiatric Association,
also developed the popular PRIME-MD (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental
Disorders) which enables the busy general practitioner to make rapid
and accurate diagnoses of depression, panic, bulimia and other common
mental disorders. The newest of these instruments, PRISM (Psychiatric
Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders), was quickly
and widely adopted as a practical and efficient tool in assessing
psychiatric disorders in people who use alcohol and other
drugs.</font></p> </blockquote> <p><font size=1>Page created by Gerry
