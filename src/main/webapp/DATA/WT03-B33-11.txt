HOW WILL WE GET OUR GUIS?

After Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh came out with a graphical user
interface (GUI), a lot of people suddenly discovered that they liked-even
needed-computers. Seven years later, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows gave PC
users some of what Mac users get so excited about. Yet millions of people
are stuck with archaic character terminals and character applications for
PCs. If GUIs are so great, what's taking so long for us to get them?
   When I visited the trading floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange this
spring, I didn't see what was so special about its GUI system. Not only
were there no mice in sight, there weren't even any windows on the screen I
was viewing. Then I discovered, as you can from this month's cover story,
that graphical interfaces can take many forms. And, in most cases, the form
that provides ease of use leads to greater productivity.
   For some UNIX techies, the resistance to GUIs is just reaction to
change. One of the best examples of the need for a GUI is desktop
publishing. Would you dream of doing desktop publishing on dumb terminals?
Not so many years ago, thousands of UNIX users did just that. Using the
troff language they embedded commands in their text that were turned into
type by typesetting machines. Imagine having to print every time you want
to see what your work looks like!
   Yes, troff on terminals is cheap-if you ignore the cost of hiring people
who know troff and dismiss the time it takes to proof a page, make
corrections, then reprint it. Techies may love troff, but business folks
are made of more pragmatic stuff-aren't they?
   Apparently not. In business, we have a wealth of tight-fisted managers
who count the cost of systems only in terms of hardware: "Get rid of our
terminals?" they might ask. "Why they work just fine. Besides, our people
already know how to use them." No doubt their predecessors were saying the
same about typewriters when word processors came along 20 years ago-and
about paper and pen before that.
   Productivity, like other measures of efficiency, is not about cost
alone. It is also based on effectiveness. It is more effective to give us
tools that are easy to learn than those that require extensive training. It
is more effective to create more functional applications if the interface
can overcome the added complexity of these more powerful tools.
   Certainly, GUIs have been hyped. Claims that they make computers
intuitive and eliminate any learning curve are absurd. GUI applications
need a consistent "look and feel" that may be lacking in the world of
freewheeling competition among open systems. And because software is a
creative medium, there are poor GUI implementations even when strict style
guidelines are available. None of these is reason enough to delay, much
less reject, GUIs.
   How will we get the GUI software and computers we need to do our work
more productively? First we have to be honest enough to admit that new ways
of working with computers are more effective. We must be open to the
changes GUIs will put us through as users, as well as the power they will
open up to us. Most importantly, we must be willing to invest in the more
powerful computers that are needed to run GUI software-that is, if we
seriously want to be productive.

After months of speculation, UNIX System Laboratories Inc. is close to
releasing its new family of UNIX products for Intel PCs. The new operating
systems, code-named "Destiny," will have lower prices and better
distribution than existing UNIX versions, and are designed to encourage
resellers to customize the systems without creating incompatibilities. What
remains unclear is whether the traditional high-price, high-margin UNIX
reseller business is ready for a mass-market approach to UNIX.
   The key to Destiny's potential success is that it's not just another PC
UNIX, says Dataquest analyst Rikki Kirzner. For the first time, USL has
thoroughly analyzed its potential market and designed a product customers
want, she says. "They created a really profitable business model."
   According to USL, the new operating systems will be available this
summer, and will be based on System V Release 4.1 ES, the enhanced-security
version of System V Release 4. Destiny will run on most IBM-compatible PCs
with a 386 or higher processor, four megabytes of memory, and a 60-megabyte
hard disk. Along with UNIX applications-which it runs using either an Open
Look or Motif graphical user interface-Destiny will also run PC DOS
applications in a "compatibility window." Destiny will be distributed and
supported as a shrink-wrapped product by Univel, the partnership between
USL and Novell Inc. USL would not confirm pricing or availability, but
Destiny is expected to have a base price of around $300.
   Does the world really need another version of UNIX for PCs? Destiny will
join an already crowded PC UNIX market. The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s SCO
UNIX and XENIX dominate the PC UNIX market with a 62% share; and Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s Sunsoft division introduced Solaris 2.0 for PCs in May.
These vendors are fighting for marketshare against non-UNIX systems such as
IBM Corp.'s OS/2, and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows and the forthcoming Windows
NT.
   For vendors and resellers, USL's business model includes making it easy
to add value without creating incompatibilities. The base Destiny operating
system can be extended by adding modules from USL without recompiling the
kernel. This encourages vendors and resellers to avoid recompilation-and
the incompatibilities it can create. To encourage retail volume, Destiny
will be sold and supported through Novell's highly successful dealer
channel, as well as by USL and its licensees. The base operating system's
price will also be closer to other high-end PC operating systems, such as
OS/2, than it will be to typical prices for existing PC versions of UNIX.
   USL's strategy may sound like overkill for the PC UNIX market, but
Kirzner points out that the stakes are much higher. USL is "the only one
who can compete against Microsoft" for the high-end PC operating system
market, she says. Destiny faces the huge installed base of Microsoft
Windows, as well as renewed competition from IBM's OS/2. USL's technical
advantage comes from SVR4's highly stable code and the security features it
inherits from 4.1 ES. By comparison, Microsoft's NT is likely to be
unreliable for several years, and IBM's OS/2 suffers from a credibility
problem with many potential customers, Kirzner says.

ACE: A SHORT AND TROUBLED LIFE

The much-ballyhooed Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) initiative hoped
to create a new standard centered around MIPS Technologies Inc.'s R4000
RISC processor, but the only winners in the failed attempt seem to be Sun
and Intel Corp. Sun continues to dominate the RISC workstation market with
a 41% share, according to International Data Corp. And Intel will close the
RISC performance gap this summer when it releases its next generation
microprocessor now known as P5. The fractured RISC market has made Intel
look like a safer choice.
   RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, has been a popular chip in
the workstation world because of its high-performance ratings, which are
almost twice as fast as Intel's highest rated chip. Intel has slowly been
making headway, however. Its P5 chip will run at 100 million instructions
per second (mips), according to an Intel representative. Intel's fastest
rated chip is currently the 50-MHz 486 DX, which runs at 41
mips-top-of-the-line RISC chips exceed 50 mips.
   By teaming together, ACE members hoped to move away from Intel's
dominance, gain marketshare in the workstation market, and set a new model
for computing in the 1990s. It didn't work. Differing agendas and financial
troubles doomed ACE. Of the five founding companies, only one remains fully
committed to the consortium. Reeling from financial troubles, Compaq
Computer Corp. has moved away from any RISC development efforts. PC UNIX
software vendor SCO quit ACE's executive committee and suspended any
related development work. Digital Equipment Corp. has put its weight behind
its own RISC chip, Alpha. And Microsoft has focused its efforts on Intel
processors. Only MIPS, the RISC vendor that had the most to gain from the
consortium, continues to say ACE is alive. Yet MIPS' financial troubles
have lessened its role as a third-party provider, and Silicon Graphics Inc.
recently purchased MIPS for $200 million.

When the ACE initiative was announced in April 1991, it was trumpeted as
the "broadest," "most extensive," "most dramatic announcement ever" in the
computer industry. Now a year later the ACE initiative has fizzled.
   Why are many users confused by hyperbolic vendor proclamations? A good
indication can be found in the topsy-turvy then-and-now comments regarding
ACE:
-- Then: "With the Advanced Computing Environment as a firm, open
foundation, computer manufacturers, software developers, and customers
alike can confidently take advantage of a new nonproprietary
standard."-Doug Michels, executive vp, SCO.
-- Now: After stepping down from ACE's executive committee and suspending
its MIPS development efforts, Michels says, "We haven't really quit the ACE
initiative. You can't quit a state of mind."
-- Then: "If I was at Sun right now, I'd be real worried: 20 major
companies have decided to build something around MIPS that has nothing to
do with SPARC."-John Metcalfe, vp of Silicon Graphics Inc.'s entry systems
division.
-- Now: "OSF was Scud I. We see ACE as Scud II."-Ed Zander, president of
Sunsoft.
-- Then: "We're very excited. We're going to be able to expand the
market."-John Paul, director of systems engineering for open systems at
Compaq.
-- Now: "If we couldn't offer a dramatic price-performance advantage with
a RISC-based system-on the order of two to three times the performance of
Intel's X86 line-customers said, 'We don't want to switch.'"

After 18 months of delays, Oracle Corp.'s Version 7 has been released.
Version 7 is Oracle's database server for enterprise-wide computing, says
Tim Negris, Oracle's senior director of corporate strategy. It will have
applications within the database called triggers and stored procedure
calls. V7 is seen as a catch-up release by some analysts, because Oracle's
competitors, especially its strongest competitor Sybase Inc., have had
these features for almost two years.
   "The significance of V7 is very favorable," says Elliot Prince, a vp at
securities firm Oppenheimer and Co. Inc.
   Although V7 will give Oracle a stronger position in the market, its
financial results have been relatively weak. In the third quarter ending in
March, Oracle reported a revenue increase of 7% to $290 million from $269
million in the same period last year.
   Says Charles Phillips, a vp with securities firm Soundview: "V7 will
give Oracle more revenue momentum."

In a move that brings the X Windows market closer to the PC industry, X
Windows terminal supplier Network Computing Devices Inc. has acquired
Spectragraphics Corp.'s GSS Personal Graphics Division, a supplier of
software that allows PCs to perform X terminal functions.
   "It turns the X terminal and PC markets from being competitive to being
complementary," says Steve Auditore, president of the X Business Group.
It's the first time an X terminal vendor has entered the PC market, he
says.
   NCD has also filed an initial public offering (IPO), and was expected to
go public in late May.
   "NCD's done everything right so far," says Patty Chang, an industry
analyst with Dataquest. She says the GSS acquisition and the IPO are both
beneficial to the company because they expand NCD's market penetration and
add cash for further acquisitions and research and development. "We expect
that NCD will be a continued success," says Chang.

DEC'S DECKED ON WALL STREET

Financially troubled DEC, traditionally a technology-oriented company that
frowned on marketing, has made a cultural flip-flop: DEC will combine
engineering and marketing in the same business units so that it can reduce
the variety of products it sells and bring new products to market faster.
   The move comes after a $294.1 million loss in the third quarter, which
one analyst dubbed "the quarter from hell." DEC will cut its workforce by
more than 10% this month.
   Analysts had predicted that DEC's new Alpha RISC chip would give the
company a much-needed marketing boost, but the hype won't turn into profits
for another year. Although the chip is rated at 150 mips, compared with the
76 mips posted by other processors, it has not yet been widely released. By
that time, some analysts say workstation leaders Sun and Hewlett-Packard
Co. will have matched Alpha's mips performance.
   "Why would someone sign on for a year-long gut-wrenching transition from
DEC's proprietary VAX line to Alpha?" asks Bob Herwick, an analyst with
Hambrecht and Quist. "No one has a big incentive to go with DEC. There's a
sense of disorganization, lack of focus, and long-term lack of
responsiveness."

Sun has a new business unit, called Sunselect, which is aimed at providing
software for integrating PCs with UNIX systems, says Carl S. Ledbetter,
newly appointed vp at Sun and general manager of the new unit. Based in
Billerica, Mass., Sunselect will offer three primary product lines: the
PC-NFS family, a group of products that allow other platforms to take
advantage of UNIX environments; the SunPC line of PC emulation products,
which enable SPARC machines to run DOS and Windows applications; and
Netware Sunlink, a software product that connects Novell Netware local-area
networks to SPARC servers.
   "Sun is trying to coexist with the PC environment," says Ken Ow-Wing,
programs manager at research firm International Technology Group. The
announcement has miffed some SPARC peripheral vendors because of the Sun PC
products. It seems Sun told some board vendors that it wouldn't make its
own accelerator boards-but decided to develop them anyway.
   This comes straight out of the "Idi Amin School of Business," says Paul
Cubbage, an analyst with Dataquest. "Sun doesn't understand it has to
nurture the market."

American Airlines and the CSX Corp., a railroad holding company, have
formed a joint venture to develop a system for trading company
communications, which will be similar to the well-regarded Sabre System.
The Sabre reservation system is the United States' most widely used airline
reservation network. The new computer software service, called Encompass,
is aimed at shippers, consignees, forwarders, and other carriers. Encompass
has standardized on Uniface Corp.'s fourth-generation language (4GL)
software, according to Anu Shukla, Uniface's vp of marketing.
   American and CSX have each invested $10 million in the project. The
potential market for the company is $1.6 billion.

NEW OPERATING SYSTEMS FLOOD SPRING COMDEX IN CHICAGO

Comdex is typically a trade show for PCs and products, not UNIX. The spring
edition in Chicago was no exception, but the hottest products at the show
were operating systems that will battle for dominance as upgrades from PC
DOS. Spring Comdex featured the public rollouts of new versions of
Microsoft's Windows and IBM's OS/2, along with the first program that
allows most PC applications to work as X Window System clients. In
addition, USL gave sneak previews of its desktop UNIX Destiny, and Mark
Williams Co. unveiled a new version of its UNIX clone Coherent.
-- Microsoft had an entire floor in the McCormick Place complex dedicated
to Windows-related software and hardware. The company officially released
Windows 3.1, a new version designed to avoid the system lock-ups that are
reportedly common with version 3.0. The Microsoft booth also had
demonstrations of Windows NT running many different Windows applications.
There's no word yet on when Windows NT will be available, but Microsoft
Senior Vice President Paul Maritz told show attendees the company doesn't
believe NT will be a viable product until 1994.
-- IBM's long-promised OS/2 2.0 was finally available for the masses to
"test drive." OS/2 will compete with Microsoft Windows: it runs on all
386-based PCs, is priced roughly the same as Windows, and runs most
existing DOS and Windows 3.0 application software. IBM demonstrated a
forthcoming version that also runs applications requiring the new Windows
3.1. IBM says its agreement with Microsoft prevented it from including the
same capability in 2.0.
-- Quarterdeck Office Systems rolled out its long-promised Desqview/X, a
DOS-based multitasker that allows users to run multiple DOS and Windows
programs simultaneously. Of interest to UNIX users is Desqview/X's X-client
capability: Desqview/X converts the character or Windows display into X
Windows commands, so that an ordinary DOS or Windows PC program can be
displayed across a network on the screen of an X terminal or workstation.
-- Mark Williams Co.'s new version of its multiuser operating system,
Coherent, will run shrink-wrapped applications written for SCO UNIX.
Coherent 4.0 was slated to be available by June for $99.

IBM-BULL AGREEMENT REAPS NEW WORKSTATIONS

The agreement between Groupe Bull and IBM bore its first fruit this month
with the introduction of a new series of Bull workstations and servers
based on IBM's Power RISC processor family. While the move brings Bull into
line with important competitors in the French market, including HP and Sun,
Bull still needs to clarify the value-added component to its monoprocessor
RISC offering. The new DPX/20 systems, range in price from $16,600 to
$158,500, and are little more than IBM RS/6000 workstations with a Bull
label. The software available on the DPX/20 is Bull's new BOS/X version 3.2
operating system, a modified version of IBM's AIX that includes support for
Bull peripherals.
   These UNIX offerings constitute an attempt to regain lost ground in the
burgeoning RISC workstation and server market, and recharge its stagnating
UNIX and open systems line.

IS UNISYS TURNING IT AROUND?

Strong gains in its UNIX systems and software products helped Unisys Corp.
post a first quarter net income of $48.3 million, after a loss of $98.2
million a year earlier. James Unruh, Unisys chairman and CEO, says "We're
not labeled as 'financially troubled' anymore, but we still have a long way
to go."
   Despite Unisys' financial recovery, it is losing marketshare and overall
revenue growth. Revenue was $2.01 billion compared to $2.06 billion in the
same quarter last year. In an attempt to become less of a box vendor and
more of a solutions-oriented company, Unruh says Unisys will increase its
efforts in the software and service sector of its business. In 1990 service
and software accounted for 30% of Unisys revenue. In 1991 it accounted for
35%.
   Some analysts still doubt Unisys' staying power, however. "The crushing
debt is still a long-term problem," says Harvey Hindin, vp with Emerging
Technologies Group. "It's like saying they're trying to climb out of a
mudpile-they could slip back down. Next quarter could be bad again. It's
hardly something to get excited about. Nothing profound is going on at
Unisys."
   Although Unisys has dropped in influence, its financial turnaround has
been excellent, says Catlin Wolfard, ananalyst with Black and Co. He
expects announcements this summer will help the company's financial
picture.

GOOD SOFTWARE IS MORE THAN CODING

By:
Editor-at-Large Walter Zintz is the Advisor Emeritus to Uni-Ops Books in
Boonville, Calif.

Software developers who fight wars over the merits of their favorite
programming tools agree on at least one point: while expertise with one's
chosen tools is absolutely essential to building good software, it's
nowhere near sufficient.
   This month, I look at books that go into five different approaches to
the higher aspects of software construction. Between them they offer a
cornucopia of styles and techniques, with something for everyone working in
software development.

Programming as if People Mattered: Friendly Programs, Software Engineering,
and Other Noble Delusions
By Nathaniel S. Borenstein
Princeton University Press; 609-896-1344
186 pages; 2 pages of Contents
ISBN 0-691-08752-0 hardbound; $24.95
Technical Level: Nontechnical or Theorist
Understandability: Crystal Clear
Summary: What user interfaces should be

In title, this book is about the human-to-software interface. Borenstein
refrains from dealing with the technical aspects of implementing
interfaces, however. Although he spends some time on semantics, he is
primarily concerned with the personal aspect: making interfaces suitable
for real human beings. Users are the main humans considered, but the book
frequently looks at problems of concern to managers and customers, as
well.
   This book's great glory is the author's implicit, but pervasive, notion
that the human interface extends through software; and that programs are
just ways that people tell computers what they should be doing. Combine
this with Borenstein's taste for doing what's "right," and you have a book
that befits the first part of its title, "Programming as if People
Mattered."
   Part two of the title describes his approach. Borenstein frequently
quotes authorities as remote and mystical as the Zen master Ikkyu and St.
John of the Cross. His own writing style is full of passion: eager to
convince, sometimes agitated, even angry about botched interfaces and the
problems they've caused.
   The result is a book filled with points to think about well before you
start coding menus or screens. Directly or indirectly, the subject is what
user interfaces should do, and even what whole programs should do with
regard to how they affect users. The text is bolstered with numerous
quotations and references for further reading. Everything is told in a
conversational style, replete with relevant anecdotes, which is what makes
it an easy-to-read investigation of a complex and controversial subject.

Building Quality Software
By Robert L. Glass
Prentice Hall; 201-767-5937
369 pages; 10 pages of Index & Contents
ISBN 0-13-086695-4 hardbound; $38.00
Technical Level: Advanced to Theorist
Understandability: Lucid
Summary: Better software without more managerial meddling

This book's unique stance is that quality in software is not so much a
matter for corporate quality control and quality assurance executives as it
is for individual programmers and their supervisors. Fortunately for the
mental health of programmers and supervisors, the book's other major
principle is that software quality is very amenable to rational,
technological techniques.
   Glass covers a broad topic, and his definition of software quality goes
beyond reliability to include matters such as maintainability and
suitability for intended purpose. Glass' solution mixes practical theory,
technology, personal and organizational practices, and advice on dealing
with the internal politics that inevitably cloud software engineering.
   As befits a book about principles-rather than step-by-step instructions
for a particular environment-Glass stresses his points strongly enough that
few thorough readers will miss any of them. Reading it requires a technical
bent and substantial knowledge of how software development actually works,
but doesn't require knowledge of math or any particular programming
language. Readers who find this level a little high will be encouraged by
frequent ironic anecdotes and a leavening of programmer-style humor. Those
who wish for a higher level will welcome the extensive references to more
technical writings.

Illustrated C
By Leor Zolman
R & D Publications; 913-841-1631
315 pages; 27 pages of Index & Contents
ISBN 0-923667-21-0 paperbound; $29.95, $39.95 with disk
Technical Level: Advanced to Expert
Understandability: Almost Crystal Clear
Summary: What to do with all the C you know

Zolman is the programmer who wrote the first C compiler for a
microprocessor-the 8080 chip-back when so many other famous programmers
were saying it wasn't possible. I expect a lot from any programming book by
Zolman, and he succeeds with this book. He plays the Plato of programming
here, reminding us of all the things we know about C and then pointing out
the unavoidable consequences that most of us don't think about.
   The target audience is programmers who have a pretty thorough knowledge
of C basics. This book details which tools should be used and how they
should be used in various programming situations and, to a lesser degree,
why other approaches that may look attractive are actually dead ends.
Zolman concentrates on three difficult-to-master areas in C: pointers,
string handling, and file I/O.
   Except for a few pleasantries like the subhead "Spicy Searching,"
Zolman's writing style is straightforward and matter-of-fact. Everything is
clear, orderly, and complete for the level of programmer this book is
targeted to. The explanations are a running commentary to realistic
programming problems, and the points are usually brought up about where
they should be-just after the reader begins to wonder what will be done
about them.
   There is a lot of code included to illustrate Zolman's points, almost
all of which takes the form of complete and well-commented utility
programs. Readers who favor hands-on experimentation can purchase the book
along with a diskette containing the code. The programs are generally ready
for either a UNIX or a DOS environment; the major exception is that several
are DOS versions of utilities that come with UNIX. The book's listings are
for ANSI C, but the diskette also has versions rewritten for Kernighan and
Ritchie C. Zolman says he's tested all the code. Much of it has passed a
much stiffer test: publication in his "Illustrated C" column in The C Users
Journal.

The Art of Technical Documentation
By Katherine Haramundanis
Digital Press; 800-344-4825 or 617-273-6473
267 pages; 20 pages of Index & Contents
ISBN 1-55558-080-7 paperbound; $28.95
Technical Level: Nontechnical
Understandability: Lucid to Crystal Clear
Summary: More than you ever expected to know about documentation

Haramundanis is a computer documentation writer who wants to tell others
what she's learned about the craft over many years. In the first four
chapters of her book, this works out well.
   She covers the basics of technical documentation and of writing,
workplans, document organization, and even career factors. The methodology
she presents is a good one for most people-I've migrated to many of these
methods myself over a decade of technical writing, and may adopt a few more
now that I've read her book. In just over 100 pages, she provides pretty
extensive and readable coverage. She writes in a style that's an excellent
example of technical writing for non-specialists: clear because it's in
plain language and to the point, easy to read because it's enthusiastic and
conversational, and lively because her method and style change from chapter
to chapter.
   The remaining chapters are less even. Here, Haramundanis goes beyond
technical writing into quasi-related disciplines: graphics, page
formatting, printing and binding, text editors, word-processing software,
other software for writing, and computer hardware. Her knowledge of these
subjects is spotty, and her opinions founder on her lack of knowledge.
She's quite good at introducing and explaining several ways of diagramming
logical information including railroad diagrams, flow charts, and
Nassi-Schneiderman diagrams. But her knowledge of computer software is
weak-a table comparing the features of several text editors has almost a
dozen errors in the vi column alone. Perhaps she felt a sense of inadequacy
while writing these chapters; her style isn't as buoyant here.
   Things look up again in a series of appendixes that hold a glossary, two
bibliographies, contact information for appropriate organizations, and a
list of relevant or semi-relevant standards. All of this is remarkably
extensive, right out to a timeline chart of the historical development of
writing.

Book Brief

Myths and Methods: A Guide to Software Productivity
by David T. Fisher (Prentice Hall).
Fisher explains the German SIABA methodology for efficient software
development. SIABA combines requirements analysis with software structure
analysis. It's a rather technical system, and this is a fairly technical
book.

STANDARD FARE, EUROPEAN STYLE

By:
Joshua Greenbaum

There's no better setting for a meeting on European open systems standards
than Brussels, the capital of the European Community. It's not just because
the European Commission took the lead in 1983 by mandating standards and
open systems for public procurement, a move that culminated in a now-famous
directive called 87/95/EEC.
   It's that the dull, gray, no-nonsense Belgian capital is the perfect
place to hold court on the dull, gray, no-nonsense world of standards.
   Cutting out on Europe's frequent standards meetings to sip beer in
Brussels' Grand Place would also mean missing out on some fairly
interesting and important developments. Like the similarly mundane U.S.
interstate highway network that started under Franklin Roosevelt, the
impact open systems will have on Europe's commerce, trade, and public
administration will be profound and lasting.
   The initial impact of Europe's standards efforts is already being felt
strongly in the public administration, where 87/95/EEC and other directives
have had a strong influence on the procurement and development of computer
systems. These public systems are being designed to serve a new level of
connectivity between countries that will form an electronic interstate
highway system for united Europe's increasingly automated societies.
   The gray-suited public administration types who populate standards
meetings see standardized technology as an important tool to smooth over
the differences in language and business culture that change at every
border. From the processing of taxes across borders to the transfer of
social data between regional public and private entities, the EC is tearing
down the digital Tower of Babel, and it is using open systems
standards-such as those mandated in 87/95/EEC-to do it.
   There is strong sense of purpose about the role of open systems in the
public sector. As stated in 87/95/EEC, the EC must take into account "the
economic importance of the roleplayed by standardization in contributing to
the creation of a Community market."
   And to achieve these goals, the EC is promoting standards-lots of them.
Which means lots of meetings, and lots of gray suits.

So Where Are the Users?
Although the meetings are well-attended, a corporate user in the audience
is as rare as a sunny day in Brussels, which begs an important question:
How well is the public sector leading the private sector into open systems?
It's obvious that, in the long run, the groundwork started in Europe's
standards meetings will build a technology foundation for public and
private users. But how fast this transfer will happen, and how much the
private sector will be able to look to the public sector's standards and
experiences for guidance, is far from clear.
   The answer may be obscure, but the problems with using the public sector
as a private sector bellwether are obvious.
   The creation of open systems standards is a slow and ponderous process.
The gray suits move at a snail's pace, their work is infinitely detailed,
and many say none of it is accomplished with anywhere near the speed
required to make it useful to a competitive, free market user.
   While technologically sophisticated, the standards world can hardly be
called technologically advanced. Its draft standards often concern
technology that has long been in use as de facto standards, and the gaggle
of standards committees have few answers to the pressing needs of users who
are trying to plan truly advanced systems within a five- or 10-year time
frame.
   Most of all, there's a built-in irony in the conflict between private
sector users and standards groups. It's essential that these users
participate to give the standards some universal appeal, but it's hard to
get the users involved.
   At a conference held last spring in Brussels for the launch of the
European Procurement Handbook for Open Systems (EPHOS), a standards text
for networking and file transfer technology developed by the EC, users were
few and far between. Across town on the same day, the launch of something
called the Process to Support Interoperability (PSI) was underway.
   PSI is a certification process set up by an industry group called the
Standards Promotion and Application Group, or SPAG, which is comprised of
such leading European companies as Alcatel Alsthom, British
Telecommunications plc., Groupe Bull, and Ing. C. Olivetti and Co., as well
as IBM Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. Here too, gray suits ruled and
non-government types were in short supply.
   The gray suits at both meetings spoke long and eloquently about the
relevance of public standards work to private industry, and both groups
acknowledged the need for private sector input. But their reasoning for the
lack of that private sector presence seemed specious. According to the
EPHOS organizers, a major reason is that few users have the technical
expertise to participate at the level EPHOS is working on. On the other
hand, the governments, under legal pressure from 87/95/EEC and local laws,
have to have at least some expertise.
   "Much of the reason we have chosen to focus on the public sector is that
we can get at them," says Ken Thompson, chairman of the Commission's Public
Procurement group, only half-joking. "It would be our wish to broaden the
input. But many private sector users don't have the necessary specialists
on staff. It's not their job when brewing beer to become specialists in
information technology."
   There are other reasons. It's expensive to run around attending
meetings, especially for private companies in the midst of a Europe-wide
recession. And especially when many users state privately that the whole
standards business is the scope, function, and raison d'etre, of the
high-priced bureaucrats that the taxpayers in Europe pay so dearly for: Who
wants to pay to watch the watchdog?
   Exactly what gets standardized when is also a major factor. The fact
that the gray suits who brave the Belgian clime to fight the standards wars
are hardly in the vanguard of technology forms another vicious circle for
the promotion of standards in the private sector. Standards by definition
can't be vanguard or even avant-garde: rear-guard is more like it. Ask
anyone why they specify Posix, and you will get a decidedly cover-your-rear
answer.
   But leading-edge technology-which often translates into leading-edge
competitiveness-is not the scope, function, or raison d'etre of the gray
suits. The most complex part of many public open systems procurements is
the systems integration involved: the technology is old hat.
   This rear-guard approach is evident in a recent government procurement
in the United Kingdom to be awarded this August called Osprey. By European
standards Osprey is a large procurement, coming in at 23 million ($35
million U.S.) for its initial phase, with more to come.

Osprey: Ready for Take-Off
Osprey is an effort to shoe the cobbler's children that was developed by
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-the government group most
associated with the promotion of technology to the private sector,
particularly open systems-to automate its own geographically and
structurally diverse empire. Osprey proposes a truly open environment that
takes into account a mix of existing technology and a plethora of
standards.
   But Osprey is designed to contain virtually no leading-edge technology,
and therefore takes no risks. Osprey is innovative in that it provides
thousands of users with a highly configurable client-server environment,
but it does so without any "gee-whiz" technology.
   Despite being a techno-yawn, DTI's approach to an open office automation
environment has a lot of potential use within the private sector, if not as
a model, then as a guideline.
   To come up with the Osprey specifications, the authors analyzed the
workflow in DTI, categorized the existing environment, surveyed user needs,
and built a painstakingly detailed business model.
   What these consultants describe in Osprey is a work environment with
many disparately located offices using a lot of different hardware and
software systems-some open, some not. It's an environment that probably
sounds familiar to most corporate users.
   The work Osprey hopes to accomplish is familiar, too. Osprey is about
pushing paper and data around a service organization-a basic requirement at
the heart of any service sector company or the service department of a
large corporation.
   A number of companies are said to be watching how the Osprey procurement
goes to see if it will become the model for public and private office
automation procurement as its designers would like it to.

Where is the Leading Edge?
If your company wants to do more leading-edge work, where do you turn? Not
Brussels.
   One of the few users at the SPAG conference, Raanan Barzel, a systems
analyst at the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), assails the SPAG's PSI work
and the EPHOS standards as useful, but for an earlier generation of
problems. The initial emphasis within both groups for relatively low-level
communications standards leaves Barzel dissatisfied.
   "We have been addressing the wrong level of standards," Barzel announced
to SPAG's audience. "At the user level, communications shouldn't be a
problem. We want to move ahead to the applications," and to the database,
object-oriented, and distributed processing standards, as well as a host of
other pressing issues for private companies like BNP.
   Such needs leave much of the standards world far behind. But standards
like SPAG's PSI and EPHOS do have an important function, even if they
satisfy a vastly different level of technological sophistication. Although
government types like Thompson bemoan the lack of user input in the
standards process, the intended procurer or developer of a public system is
not necessarily a techie like Barzel, who has been using UNIX since the
late 1970s. In many ways, the whole idea of government standards works best
when users don't have to participate in, or even be aware of, the whole
process.

Snapping Systems Together
Speakers at the two conferences also spoke of an ideal world inwhich
government users would be able to use standards to design open systems the
way a child uses a Lego set. Choose the right size and color piece and snap
it in: There's no need to understand how the snap works, or what went into
building the individual piece.
   What's good for the techno-illiterate bureaucrat could be good for
Thompson's beer brewer: it should be enough to know how to brew good beer
without having to learn to brew standards too. If the standards are
well-defined and a certification process like PSI works-every branded
product interoperates with every other branded product-the brewer can
construct a system by choosing products from an open systems catalog. As
long as the catalog is thick enough.
   And right now it isn't. According to EPHOS and SPAG, the catalog is
limited.
   Even at its best, such a catalog would contain largely gray, colorless
standards. The problem with standards is the blessing, and the curse, of
all creation: that which is created is always made in the image of the
creator. The European open systems of tomorrow, born from the gray,
industrial meeting halls of Brussels, may end up as gray as the suits
sitting in rapt attention at a discourse on X.500 standards.

SUN UNVEILS ITS FIRST MULTIPROCESSING DESKTOP

The new SPARCstation 10 workstation represents Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
vision of desktop machines that progressively integrate more and more
"peripheral" devices. The SPARCstation 10 brings together a half-dozen
features that have never been found in one place before. You can upgrade
the CPU by swapping daughterboards. It has a built-in integrated services
digital network (ISDN) connection, along with Ethernet and twisted pair.
Graphics capabilities are standard. And it's the first SPARCstation with
four SBus board expansion slots and a built-in parallel port for printers.
   Not to say there aren't drawbacks. While the SPARCstation 10 is the
first multiprocessing desktop system, the multiprocessing operating system
you need-Sunsoft's Solaris 2.0-isn't scheduled to be out until later this
fall. If it's speed you're looking for, the single-processor SPARCstation
10 just barely reaches the performance level of the low-end Hewlett-Packard
Co. HP 9000 Model 720 workstation. And although the computer has four SBus
slots, one of them is taken up with a board for 2- and 3-D graphics.
   The fact that the SPARCstation 10 is not just another powerhouse for
scientists and engineers is what differentiates it from the other machines
Sun has introduced at the high end of its product line. On the commercial
side, financial analysts doing lots of number crunching can use its desktop
power without off-loading to a compute server. On the development side, its
built-in audio and ISDN port make it a logical, although expensive,
platform for multimedia application programmers. Sun is also positioning
the SPARCstation 10 as a repository for network management information.
   The workstation uses Texas Instruments Inc.'s SuperSPARC processor,
which integrates all of the integer and floating point calculations-as well
as one megabyte of cache and the memory management features-into a single
chip the size of a silver dollar. The fastest HP machinehas only a
half-megabyte of cache. According to TI, the processor can issue and
execute three instructions per clock cycle.
   The processor also integrates the 64-bit connection to the Sun MBus
slots. The CPU itself is on a detachable daughterboard called an MBus
board, and the peripheral slots accommodate SBus boards. The advantage is
that as semiconductor companies come out with faster SPARC processors, you
can simply lift out one daughterboard and plug in a faster one. The
SPARCstation 10 has two MBus slots so that with two processors and the
Solaris 2.0 operating system, you get multiprocessing.
   Having the CPU on a detachable daughterboard is not a new idea. Digital
Equipment Corp.'s DECstation 5000 machines offered detachable
daughterboards for its RISC CPUs a year ago. The difference is that the
DECstation relies on a single processor vendor, the MIPS Technologies Inc.
subsidiary of Silicon Graphics Inc., but you can upgrade the Sun CPU
whenever the SPARC processor vendors leapfrog each other with a new
design.
   For Nancy Battey, workstation analyst with International Data Corp.,
this investment protection is key to the potential success of the
SPARCstation 10. "It's a great investment story," she says, because users
get "a growth path for future capabilities, instead of locking you into one
system with no room to grow."
   The upgradeable daughterboard is not the only comparison between
DECstations and the SPARCstation 10, though. DEC is making a concerted
effort to position its workstations as multimedia development platforms, as
is Silicon Graphics with its low-end Iris Indigo.
   The place where the SPARCstation 10 outshines the Indigo and the low-end
HP Model 9000 Series 705 workstations is in upgrade capability, says
Battey. "You can upgrade the graphics on the Indigo, but that's it. You get
a solution for today, but what about three years down the road when budgets
are getting cut" and you need a faster machine, she asks.
   The SPARCstation 10 comes in four models: a 36-MHz uniprocessor version,
a 40-MHz uniprocessor version with extra cache on the daughterboard, a
45-MHz dual-processor version, and a 45-MHz four-processor version. The
machine can accommodate up to 500 megabytes of internal memory and up to
848 megabytes of internal disk storage. By comparison, the high-end HP
workstation offers less internal memory (192 megabytes maximum) but more
internal disk storage (2.6 gigabytes maximum). The SPARCstation 10 also has
a 1.4 megabyte floppy disk drive.
   According to IDC's Battey, Sun's concurrent release of the SPARCstation
10 and the SPARCserver 10 will place them snugly at the low-end of the
servers and the high-end of the workstations, and will allow them to steal
sales from both. According to IDC's estimates, 38.6 percent of Sun's 1991
sales of 189,000 units were high-end SPARCstation 2 workstations and
servers. "The SPARCstation 10 will make that percentage go up," predicts
Battey.
   The base price for the SPARCstation 10 starts at $18,495 for a
uniprocessor version; about $20,000 more for the dual-processor version;
and $40,000 more for the four-processor version. For performance figures,
Sun is using the revised SPECmark calculation, which splits performance
numbers into two categories: one to rate integer performance and one to
rate floating-point performance. Sun estimates the preliminary
single-processor SPECmarks for the SPARCstation 10 to be between 40 and 50
SPECmarks for integer performance, and between 45 and 55 SPECmarks for
floating-point performance.
   The diskless low-end HP/Apollo 9000 Model 720 costs about $6,000 less,
but it runs at 55.5 SPECmarks. Sun argues that its workstations provide
"more balanced" performance spread between the CPU, cache, memory, disk,
and network; that is, measuring more than just the CPU, as HP does.
Although Sun still faces some daunting price and performance comparisons
with HP-the winner and still champion of SPECmark races-things can and will
change. SPARC-processor manufacturer Cypress Semiconductor is already
waiting in the wings with an even faster SPARC CPU.

GOING GRAPHICAL

By:
Frank Hayes

At the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), up to $1 million in stock changes
hands every minute. Productivity is easy to measure-it's how fast a trader
can register a buy or sell order in the frenzied atmosphere of the exchange
floor.
   It's all computerized, of course, but there's no time for keyboards, or
even mice. Instead, traders poke with fingers and pencils at graphical
menus on one of TSE's 250 touch screens, then race away to make another
deal. "As an interface," says Wayne Fowler, TSE's director of technology
and network services, "it has been very successful."
   "Ease of use" is a catchy phrase, but it's often hard to measure the
benefit users get from graphical interfaces-and to compare that benefit
with the extra cost of the workstations, X terminals, Macintoshes, or
Microsoft Windows software required to run them. For many information
systems executives, graphical user interfaces are an expensive and
unfamiliar new technology with uncertain advantages over the conventional
character-based systems they replace.
   Fortunately, many information systems people, including the ones we
interviewed, have already been down this road. They've adopted graphical
systems in a variety of industries and applications to accomplish a variety
of goals. They now have the experience to know what's important in making
graphical interfaces worth the extra cost and work in large computer
installations.

The Graphical Revolution
If workstations and PCs were the wave of the 1980s, the 1990s are riding
the crest of mice and menus. The numbers tell the story. Workstations with
graphical interfaces now make up more than half of all UNIX computers.
Sales of X terminals that can run UNIX-based graphical interfaces are
doubling every year. On PCs, Microsoft Corp. says it has sold 10 million
copies of the version of Windows it rolled out in 1990.
   The first mass-market computer with a graphical interface, Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, was introduced in 1984. Butneither the Mac nor
its imitators, such as Windows, were instant successes.
   The problem was typical of new technologies: as long as the old
character-based hardware and software did the job, customers didn't see
much reason to replace them with graphical systems. And, as long as
character applications were selling, there was no reason for software
vendors to invest in learning how to create graphic applications, so there
were fewer graphical applications for users to justify getting the hardware
required to run them.
   It took until the end of the 1980s for graphical interfaces to become an
unqualified success.
   The most obvious elements of graphical systems haven't changed much over
the years: on-screen "windows" that can contain text or pictures, "pop-up"
menus that can be used at any time, and a device called a mouse that allows
a user to choose by pointing rather than by typing.
   What makes the Mac and its imitators user-friendly isn't just the
on-screen pictures and the mouse, although those elements make the computer
seem less forbidding to novice users. Much of any graphical system's power
comes from the consistency of the software applications. "Once you've
learned the first one, it's a lot easier to learn the second and third
ones. They're all alike," says Tom Wnuk, senior data processing officer at
Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   Another benefit comes from multiple windows. Many information systems
departments have turned to graphical interfaces to replace desks full of
terminals, each connected to a different computer system. By networking
those systems, a single workstation or X terminal with several windows can
use each window to replace a terminal-and information can easily be copied
from one window to another.
   Still another advantage is something character terminals just can't
offer: on-screen graphics. As Jack London, director of the medical computer
facility at Fox Chase Cancer Center discovered, that can elevate the
benefit of a graphical system from simple ease of use to much greater
productivity.
   As for productivity, numbers are hard to come by. Academic experiments
in testing labs frequently claim graphical interface users learn
applications faster and use more kinds of software-but does that translate
into more productive work?
   To try to find out the real benefits and costs of graphical systems, we
talked to various users who have put graphical interfaces to work in
business situations. They've learned the power and the pitfalls of these
systems, and most are now convinced that the results-less training, better
applications, and happier users-are worth the price.

Bang for the Buck
The price was higher at TSE than it is at most other organizations that
turn to graphical interfaces, but TSE had a big problem to solve. Its
high-energy traders had no interest in learning a computerized trading
system, yet TSE had committed to putting all transactions through a
computerized "book" to guarantee that all stocks were traded at the market
price. According to Fowler, the solution was a step beyond conventional
graphical interfaces-250 touch-screen terminals and PCs, all running
versions of a Motif-based trading application.
   Fowler says it wasn't hard to get traders to use the touch-screen
system. "They just walk up to it and poke it with a finger or a pencil," he
says. A somewhat tougher task fell to TSE's information systems
staff-writing the custom application that traders now poke at. Even that
didn't require a major effort, Fowler says: it only took two or three
programmers working on the original program for less than six months.
   Since then they've continued to tweak it, especially for speed.
"Windowing systems tend to be very slow," says Fowler; details such as a
background color or whether an on-screen button is shaded can make a
difference in speed. Concentrating on details like these, TSE's information
systems staff has squeezed response time to less than one second.
   And even the touch-screens, which cost $2,000 more than an ordinary VGA
PC monitor, are a comparative bargain, Fowler says. Using high-resolution
monitors for mouse-based workstations would have cost $5,000 to $6,000
each.
   At the Fox Chase Cancer Center, a major cancer research hospital, the
goal was also ease of use, according to London. Doctors and nurses at Fox
Chase used a series of menus on character terminals to check patient
records, but the system was slow and hard to use.
   "They said, 'Why don't you just put Macs in everywhere?'" London laughs.
The reason was cost: replacing each VT220 terminal with a
several-thousand-dollar large-screen Macintosh would have been far too
expensive, and the hospital didn't need full-scale computers-just graphical
terminals.
   Instead of Macs, London turned to relatively inexpensive X terminals to
improve the system's usability-but the result was a new capability. "We did
a little prototype, and showed it to the doctors," recalls London. "They
asked, 'Can you do images?'"
   Although some medical images, such as X rays, require scanning films,
others-such as CAT (computerized axial tomography) scans and MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging) results-are already digitized. Today, the text of
patient records and patient-related images are available on the system.
Patient medical files don't get lost, and the images can be used by more
than one person at once-another big plus for productivity.
   But if the graphical system cured a problem, the medicine wasn't
inexpensive. "The cost was in the migration programming effort," London
says. The programming staff had to shift from programming in Pascal on VMS
to C under Ultrix, and had to learn the subtleties of using the X Window
System.
   At Connecticut Mutual, the goal was to give easy access to information
to the customer service department. Customer service was labor- and
paper-intensive for Connecticut Mutual in 1990, which is when the company
decided to move to a graphical interface using Microsoft Windows.
   According to Roger Thibodeau, chief engineer in the company's data
processing department, in the last 20 to 25years, Connecticut Mutual had
built a variety of systems-all on IBM Corp. mainframes-for tracking
policies. The menu-based systems required users to navigate through screen
after screen to track down the value of a single insurance policy, and then
write the information down on paper. Finding the cash value of a customer's
half-dozen policies could leave the customer waiting overnight. And in some
cases, waiting overnight would mean the value of the policies had changed,
so the numbers were already out of date.
   Rewriting the system from scratch was too expensive and, as Thibodeau
points out, "There's a lot of intelligence built in those" older programs.
Instead, Thibodeau's department developed an application called
"Superinquiry." Now, users simply type in the customer's name and
Superinquiry automatically reads the screens from the mainframe query
programs, adds policy cash values, and delivers the information to the
user's PC screen. That shortens the query time from overnight to less than
30 seconds.
   "The net productivity gain is enormous," says Thibodeau-and with that
gain, Connecticut Mutual is on target for paying back its investment in the
graphical system.

Information Systems Solutions
While graphical interfaces can empower users, they're also good for helping
to meet more traditional information systems department goals, including
more efficient software development, reduced maintenance and training for
users, and automating functions to cut costs.
   DHL Systems Inc. provides the core information systems functions for the
affiliated companies that form the DHL Worldwide Express courier service.
According to Deborah Gordon, DHL Systems' manager of development support,
the company turned to UNIX workstations and graphical interfaces to
introduce computer-aided software engineering for developing new
applications and systems. That meant graphical interfaces not only for
programmers, but also for documentation writers who used them to create
manuals, software librarians who used them to track versions of
applications in development, and managers who used them to track
development projects.
   The result was the expected improvement in productivity, but with an
unexpected benefit for the programmers. The new tools, Gordon says, "are
much more complex than any of the tools we had before." Without the
graphical interface, such tools would have been unusable.
   "We are able to make more complex applications. It's quite formidable,"
she says. On the other hand, Gordon points out, "You start needing some
additional skills within your company. You need some standards for the
graphics to communicate. Our documentation group emphasizes using them
properly."
   At WMAQ-TV in Chicago, Ill. the decision to add Macintoshes for the
advertising sales department cut across the grain of corporate computing
strategy. The television station is one of a half-dozen owned and operated
by NBC Television Stations-and NBC is a solidly IBM shop, according to Joe
Harris Jr., director of information technology for the stations NBC owns.
   Harris faced a hard sell convincing his bosses that graphical computers
were a good idea. He finally convinced them that a graphical system would
be easier to learn and use by renting 10 Macs, loading them with software,
and sending them to the executives' children. "Every single executive ended
up liking the machine," says Harris-and now, the television stations he
serves all have at least one Mac.
   But Harris' goal wasn't child's play; he hoped the Macs would encourage
people in advertising sales and several related departments to actively use
the system. Before the Macs, Harris says, information on advertising rates
and customers was available on terminals connected to a mainframe, but the
salespeople rarely used them.
   "Now," says Harris, "it looks just like an Apple commercial," with the
sales staff using the machines for creating sales presentations, preparing
rate schedules on spreadsheets, and exchanging e-mail with ad agencies.
   The network of Macs also promised to require less maintenance and
training than conventional computers or terminals-a crucial item, because
WMAQ didn't want the cost of a large on-site information systems staff. The
result: only a month after training, WMAQ users were not only using their
computers, but had also become largely self-sufficient, and no longer
required Harris and his staff to answer most questions.
   Eventually, says Harris, that will show up in the bottom line by
justifying the $250,000 investment with higher advertising sales and a
smaller budget for technical staff. For the moment, though, it's too soon
to measure the savings, he says.
   Halfway across the continent, the New Yorker got similar results by
pursuing a different goal. Pamela Older, vice president and director of
manufacturing for the magazine, wanted to eliminate the large weekly
typesetting bills by computerizing-but without upsetting the traditional
look or the low-tech habits of the editors. Her solution was to use a
network of Macs where they would do the most good-on the desks of editorial
assistants and the staff that compiles the weekly cultural and
entertainment calendar, "Goings On About Town."
   Exactly matching the New Yorker's well-known look required custom
typefaces and other extra costs, Older says, but the results are worth it:
the $350,000 Mac-based system will save $1 million in typesetting costs in
the first year alone. As at WMAQ, Older says users now learn on their own.
And now other departments, such as research, want Macs, too.

Two for One
At the Gradison division of McDonald and Co. Securities Inc., 60 brokers
once had two terminals on each desk. They would have had three, except that
one terminal did double duty through a special data switch that required
users to switch back and forth between two systems, according to Jim
Honerkamp, vice president and director of computer services for Gradison.
   Today, X terminals let brokers see all of their work in individual
windows at once. "It's a huge improvement over our old environment," both
for brokers and the computer staff, says Honerkamp.
   Under the old system, brokers were often confused by how to use the
double-duty terminals, and the data switch "required lots of babysitting,"
Honerkamp says. Now, with everything on a single screen, brokers don't get
confused, and the information systems department spends less time solving
problems with the brokers and the data switch. "We've been able to actually
reduce our workload," Honerkamp says.
   Eventually, Gradison wants to develop imaging applications, such as
signature verification, but right now the applications are still text-only.
"In the real world," says Honerkamp, "environments are like we have:
multiple proprietary hosts, with users who need information from all of
them. Graphical interfaces can pile these things together very efficiently.
It's the same old environment, just repackaged."
   It's a similar story at the headquarters of the United Association of
Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the
United States and Canada.
   "Overall, the graphical user interface makes a lot of sense," says Don
Lipp, information systems manager for the United Association, a union whose
members have specialties ranging from plumbing to heating and air
conditioning, metallurgy, and nuclear reactor technologies. The union's
headquarters staff has to keep track of 320,000 members, including their
education, skills, and specialities. In the past, that required multiple
terminals on each desk. Now, each user can get information on a Unisys
Corp. mainframe, four UNIX systems, and a Novell Inc. Netware server-all
through a single PC running Microsoft Windows.
   Lipp says he put in extra effort to simplify and automate the users'
log-in process so that the graphical interface and the PC network were easy
to use and reliable. The result: even the least adventurous users now have
all the capabilities they once had through their multiple terminals, while
more aggressive users have fewer limits on their access to information.

The Downside
Not all of the information systems professionals we talked to were
delighted with the results of graphical interfaces. For some, the costs
turned out to be much higher than expected. For others, the expense meant
they had to look for other alternatives.
   Oregon Health Sciences University hoped to use PCs running Microsoft
Windows as administrative workstations connected to its IBM mainframe,
according to Don Adams, microcomputer analyst at the teaching hospital. The
advantage was supposed to be a much shorter learning curve for
non-technical users. But the biggest learning curve turned out to be for
the technical staff.
   "Setting up these machines was very difficult," says Adams, "one and a
half to two days for one machine to work reliably. The set-up program was
very buggy and inconsistent." In the end, the staff had to write its own
installation scripts. Adams expects the new version of Windows to work
better, and he's considering IBM's OS/2 2.0 as an alternative. But until
the installation and maintenance problems are resolved, Windows will only
be on about 50 of the hospital's more than 800 PCs.
   At PPG Industries, Information Services Manager Bob Brookes doesn't
disagree that graphical interfaces can improve productivity-they're on the
desks of all his programmers-but he says the cost doesn't always make it
feasible for office workers.
   PPG, a maker of automotive replacement glass, had users who needed
access to two mainframe systems in its wholesale distribution branch.
However, those users were already accustomed to switching between two
sessions on their terminals. When the company shifted to a UNIX system, PPG
opted for a similar screen-switching program instead of a graphical
interface.
   The chief reason: the cost of installing graphical PCs or X terminals
just wasn't in the budget. "We knew about graphical user interfaces, but
with 450 terminals to replace, the cost was considerable," says Brookes.
The less-expensive solution also reduced the disruption for all those
users-it's much more similar to whatthey're used to, Brookes says. Would
Brookes prefer a graphical approach? "If we could afford it," he says.

Keys to Success
Generally, the investment in graphical systems appears to be worth it. The
key to success is to plan carefully and go slowly when you go graphical-but
go.
   Tackle the departments that will give you the most bang for your buck
first, advises New Yorker's Older. Recognize that you can get a lot of
benefit just from collecting several existing terminals onto a single
screen, say Gradison's Jim Honerkamp, DHL Systems' Deborah Gordon, and the
United Association's Don Lipp. Get users involved, and they'll come up with
new ways to be more productive, agree Fox Chase's Jack London and WMAQ-TV's
Joe Harris.
   Their accumulated experience doesn't translate into proof positive that
going graphical will result in higher productivity. But their accumulated
experience indicates that it is more likely that you'll be able to make a
graphical system worth the investment.


FIGURE 1: Pluses and Minuses of Going Graphical
Pluses:
+ Applications all work in similar ways, so they're easier for users to
learn, and require less training and information systems staff support.
+ Multiple windows let users see all the information they need at once,
and can cut the clutter of several terminals on a desk.
+ Cut-and-paste lets users move information directly into documents,
eliminating copying errors.
+ Graphics can give easier access to non-textual data such as signatures
and medical images.
+ Users are less likely to fight the system, and will use it more
effectively.
Minuses:
- Up-front cost of hardware is higher than for character terminals.
- Building custom applications requires learning skills in graphical
programming.
- Setup and network management may be more complex than using dumb
terminals.

FIGURE 2: Of Mice and Menus
Only about 10 percent of existing desktop PCs use a graphical user
interface such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows. On larger systems ranging from
workstations to mainframes, about 10 percent of the new seats sold each
year are graphics-capable.

ON THE HORIZON

By:
F.H.

The mouse has been a mainstay of graphical user interfaces since their
earliest days, but it may have competition in the future.
   At the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), instead of clicking with a mouse,
users make selections by tapping the screen with a finger or pencil. The
touch screens are expensive, admits Wayne Fowler, TSE's director of
technology and network services, but they're much easier for traders on the
floor to use than a mouse would be.
   Pen computers try to take simplicity a step further by letting users
write on the screen-and recognizing what's been written. The most popular
pen computer is the Gridpad from the Grid Systems division of Tandy Corp.
(Fremont, Calif.). Gridpad, which has been on the market since 1990, is
about the size of an encyclopedia volume; a user can print on the LCD
screen with a stylus, and the computer will slowly convert the image of the
printing into conventional screen type.
   Other computer makers, including NCR Corp. and several Japanese vendors,
expect to introduce similar machines this year. Microsoft Corp. has
released pen extensions for Microsoft Windows, and IBM Corp. has
demonstrated an experimental pen computer that runs UNIX with pen
extensions for the MIT X Window System.
   While pens may let users manipulate graphical systems more easily,
another development on the horizon-so-called "prescient" user
interfaces-may necessitate even less manipulation.
   A prescient user interface remembers how a user performs certain tasks
and, using artificial-intelligence techniques, anticipates some of the
user's actions and provides information the user is likely to need. No such
products exist yet, but Apple Computer Inc. Chairman John Sculley has said
he believes this style of computing would be a potent extension of
graphical technology, especially for users who have trouble with even the
relatively easy graphical systems of today.

A FLOOD OF WINDOWS

By:
F.H.

By the end of 1992, a flood of new and improved graphical systems will be
available for PCs and UNIX. On the UNIX side, vendors of X Window terminals
should begin to use the most recent release of the MIT X Window System,
release five, in products this year.
   But it's the PC market that is seeing the greatest flood of products.
This spring, four companies released new versions of their graphical
systems almost simultaneously. Microsoft Corp. released version 3.1 of
Microsoft Windows, that solved many of the problems of stability and
reliability Windows users have complained about.
   IBM Corp. launched OS/2 2.0, the new version of its multitasking
operating system for PCs that can also run Windows programs. Although
OS/2's earlier versions, which IBM co-developed with Microsoft, failed to
capture the interest of buyers, IBM is now competing directly against
Microsoft for Windows users-and competing hard.
   Quarterdeck Office Systems Inc. (Santa Monica, Calif.) released
Desqview/X, a new version of its multiwindow system that combines an X
Windows terminal emulator and multitasking of character-based DOS
applications. Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a new release of its NewWave
graphical system, and The Santa Cruz Operation Inc. released version 2.0 of
Open Desktop, its UNIX graphical environment.
   Still in the wings are Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, which is
not expected to be available until next year, and the forthcoming Taligent
operating system from Kaleida, the joint venture between Apple Computer
Inc. and IBM.

SUN BLOCK
Its founder incinerated by giant rival Sun Microsystems, Solbourne Computer
appoints a new seer. Can he see a way out of Sun's shadow?

By:
Gary Andrew Poole

Three years ago, Solbourne Computer Inc. wanted to be The Next Great
Workstation Company. The upstart start-up had a better mousetrap and a very
big cheese investor: Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Being tiny,
it could be nimble. Solbourne promised to unveil a workstation a full six
months ahead of Sun Microsystems Inc. that would better Sun's product in
price, performance, and service. Solbourne would become to open systems
what Compaq Computer Corp. was to personal computers-the superior, and
super-successful, alternative. But then Solbourne stumbled and trapped
itself.
   As Sun plodded closer and closer to the marketplace with its next
generation SPARCstation, Solbourne dithered. It had seven products in
various stages of development, including a superior file server. As founder
and president, Doug MacGregor, a technical whiz, juggled limited resources
to try to seize all of Solbourne's opportunities, the workstation began to
slip. It didn't meet performance goals. Deliveries were moved back.
Suddenly those six months were gone.
   Reviewers in 1989 liked Solbourne's Series 4 SPARC-compatible
workstation, particularly its proprietary bus and multiprocessing
architecture, but it was barely cheaper than Sun's original. Today it plays
a minor role in the marketplace, and at Solbourne itself, which has found
greater success with its high-performance server.
   Now Sun is introducing its own server. With nearly four times as many
workers in its marketing department as Solbourne's full workforce of 220
people, Sun seems poised to crush its tiny competitor.
   What has Solbourne done to combat this potentially fatal eclipse? Until
this spring, nothing. MacGregor struggled to eke a profit from the
company's $70 million in annual sales, and says he was on the verge of
doing so. But in April Solbourne abruptly fired MacGregor and named in his
place Carl Herrmann, who had been vice president of international
operations. Equipped with an MBA from The Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania and a background in marketing, the taciturn Herrmann says
he will do a better job of selling what Solbourne builds, rather than build
anything new to sell. Solbourne has already scheduled the introduction of
another server later this year, but research and development will otherwise
take a back seat to marketing.
   If Solbourne's directors hoped their April bombshell would shock their
foes, they are shell-shocked themselves. Herrmann is little known outside
his company, and his first pronouncement, in an interview with UNIXWORLD,
was: "I have helped develop the company's overall strategy. The change in
management does not in any way change Solbourne's strategic direction."
   Herrmann's statement is all the more surprising because, as everyone
outside of Solbourne itself seems to recognize, the company doesn't have
any strategic direction.
   "Solbourne's products are technologically superior-I'm not impressed
with Sun's server line," says Tom Willmott of the Aberdeen Group market
research firm. "But there are serious questions about the future of the
company. It's difficult for a small hardware company to compete against Sun
in the same market niche."
   Paul Cubbage of Dataquest is even harsher in his assessment. "Market
dynamics are against Solbourne," he says. "Does it matter who the new
president is? I don't think so, unless he walks on steam."

Walking on Air
When Solbourne set out to conquer the workstation market, it faced some
hurdles, but hot air wasn't one of them. MacGregor had solid technical
credentials: One of the designers of the Motorola Inc. 68020
microprocessor, MacGregor was working on his doctorate in computer science
in Japan. In October 1987, Sun announced it would license its Scalable
Processor Architecture (SPARC) chip. Burning with desire to clone the
technology, MacGregor approached Matsushita for funding and Solbourne was
born. Matsushita owns 52 percent of the firm, with MacGregor and other
employees holding the balance.
   In January 1989 Solbourne introduced its Series 4 multiprocessing
workstations and a companion line of servers. In October 1990 it followed
with the S4000 workstation, its first uniprocessor model. But Sun's
introduction of its own competing workstation, and its ability to trim
prices and bully distributors into freezing out Solbourne, doomed the
workstations. Solbourne is now emphasizing its newest generation of
servers: the Series 5E, a family of symmetric multiprocessors. The 5E/800i
is a network server that supports up to four processors for an office
environment; the 5E/900 Enterprise Server supports up to eight processors
for computer rooms.
   However, "No hardware company, whether it's $70 billion or $70 million,
will survive if it doesn't add significant value to its hardware," says
Shmuel Halevi, vice president of The Technology Research Group.
"Solbourne's trying to add software value, but how well it's executing is
yet to be seen."
   Just before MacGregor was sacked, Solbourne belatedly formed a software
business unit to focus on the development, distribution, and support of
software products for building X Windows-based C++ applications. The
software group is small-11 developers and four marketing and sales
people-but it has made agreements with Centerline Software Inc., Parcplace
Systems, and The Qualix Group, to help develop and distribute
object-oriented technology. But even this tentative step forward has come
at the expense of internal dissention.
   "There has been some resistance from the hardware sales and marketing
side," says George Kakatsakis, general manager of the new unit.
Nonetheless, he insists, "We're moving toward the high-end, commercial
customer, and they need this type of development environment."
   Solbourne has indeed made gains in the commercial market, where its
technical excellence is less important than it is with scientific
purchasers. Commercial sales have increased sixfold in two years, but
remain just 30 percent of Solbourne's business. Here too, the company
remains a hardware player, and that has meant micron-thin profit margins.
Solbourne officials claim the company will manage its first-albeit
tiny-profit this year, but only by cutting staff to the bone-Solbourne laid
off 10 percent of its workforce early this year.

What Will Solbourne Market?
Sun's new line of servers attacks Solbourne where it lives-in technology.
Sun's new machines are based around the Viking chip, which promises to have
excellent multiprocessing capabilities. Solbourne's symmetric
multiprocessing operating system has been superior to Sun's operating
system, but the Viking-based server could overcome any performance gaps. If
the chip delivers, Solbourne's only market-and only marketing-edge
disappears.
   Hunkered down in his Longmont, Colorado, headquarters, Solbourne's new
general has met requests for information by shunting questioners to his
lieutenants. Travis White, vice president of marketing, says, "We've had
great technology, but we've never articulated it. With Carl, we'll increase
our marketing push."
   On the battlefield, that would be called a tactic, not a strategy-and
it's a frail one. White's staff numbers 15, and while it recently embarked
on a direct mail and print advertising campaign to generate name
recognition, Solbourne might have done better to keep its wallet in its
pocket and go courting its existing customers. Their loyalty is suspect.
   "I have some serious concerns about Solbourne," says Russ Goebel, a
systems analyst with Sandia National Laboratories, a research and
development company for the U.S. Department of Energy. "If I had to make a
decision today about buying a Solbourne machine I'd wait."
   Goebel uses a Solbourne Series 5000 600 multiprocessing machine, but
says he's concerned about buying machines from SPARC-compatible vendors
because he says Sun "calls all the shots" and that's "dangerous because
their future is in the hands of one vendor."
   And although Solbourne's fate will be decided in the U.S. market, its
new president has spent most of his career abroad. Before joining Solbourne
last year, Herrmann ran the Far East operations of Hong Kong-based Amphenol
East Asia Ltd., a worldwide supplier of cables and connectors for the
electronics industry. Before that he was managing director of the Singapore
subsidiary of Genrad Inc., a vendor of test and measurement systems for
electronic and mechanical products.

A New Watch-Or a Death Watch?
Analysts say Solbourne can probably coast on the strength of its file
servers for at least another year. Its emerging software products offer a
glimmer of hope that the company can transform itself into a value-added
vendor, as well as a high-quality manufacturer. But replacing a technical
genius with a marketer doesn't inspire confidence on that score. Appointing
Herrmann to run the company at least postpones the other option Matsushita
faced before Solbourne acted-pulling the plug altogether.
   "Matsushita is one of the most respected manufacturing companies in
Japan," says Jeff Morgan, co-author of the book Cracking the Japanese
Market, "but it's facing some tough economic times. It's scaling back its
outside investments. Solbourne has to answer to Matsushita."
   "The Japanese," he adds ominously, "will kill a company without
flinching. They're very unsentimental."
   Since Matsushita made its initial investment in Solbourne, the Japanese
stock market has crashed to about half its former level. Although $60
billion Matsushita dwarfs $3.6 billion Sun as completely as Sun dominates
Solbourne, the Japanese economy is tottering on the edge of recession and
even its biggest conglomerates are retrenching-especially in the United
States, where investments from Rockefeller Center to Pebble Beach have gone
sour. Solbourne represents an almost trivial investment when compared to
those glamour deals, but as MacGregor's firing makes clear-it doesn't pass
unnoticed.
   For now, Solbourne Computer has been given a new lease on life. New
President Herrmann will wring as many marketing dollars from Solbourne's
cash flow as he can, and he'll start making the calls. It's a sales mantra:
"You make the calls, you get the business."
   The market will be watching. Is Herrmann another Lee Iacocca? Or is he
another Willy Loman?

THE WIZARD OF AUSPEX
"You need someone to map between what the engineers know and what users can
understand," -Bruce Nelson, chief technologist, Auspex Systems Inc.

By:
Howard Baldwin

ONE WINDY DAY IN 1983, DURING one of his many South Sea sabbaticals, Bruce
Nelson was driving on a two-lane highway between Cairns and Townsville on
Australia's northeast coast. Seeing a fallen tree blocking the road, he
stopped to drag it out of the way. As he approached, though, one end of the
obstacle slowly rose and hissed at him. It wasn't a tree. It was a 12-foot
python stretched across the road, warming itself on the asphalt.
   Unperturbed, Nelson grabbed the end that didn't hiss and wiggled it up
and down until the python slithered off the road. As chief technologist for
Auspex Systems Inc., a manufacturer of high-capacity file servers, Nelson
would like to handle the computer industry the same way: just yank the tail
of the marketing people and maneuver them out of the way of the customers.
   Everyone knows someone like Nelson: a freewheeling know-it-all who
whizzed by on the way to fame, fortune, and founders' stock. Except for
Nelson, now 40, it hasn't happened. His friends expect great things from
him, and compare him to Andy Bechtolsheim, the brilliant but mercurial
creator of the SPARCstation upon which Sun Microsystems Inc. has built its
fortune. But this Nelson guy is plugging away for a single-product server
vendor, his third start-up firm in eight years.
   He marches to a different drummer and scoffs: "I don't feel any
compulsion to meet their expectations. I compete largely with myself. I
don't compare myself to other guys who I see in industry or in private
life." So why hasn't anything clicked for Nelson? "Sometimes I stick with
things too long. I think I'd be further down the road if I was less
committed and more mercenary."
   What has Nelson committed to now? Stand back, vendors-he wants nothing
less than honesty from an industry awash in hype. He wants customer
adversaries to become customer advocates-even among Auspex's competition,
which includes the server divisions of Sun, Silicon Graphics Inc., and
Hewlett-Packard Co.
   If people expect great things from Nelson, and Nelson expects great
things from the industry, perhaps it's because his first job out of college
was at Xerox Computer Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), where many
of technology's greatest ideas were born. He joined PARC after receiving
his master's degree in computer science from Stanford University in 1976.
The technologies taken for granted today-mice, networking, laser printers,
object-oriented programming-were being developed by the industry's most
creative minds all around him. He alternated between PARC and
Carnegie-Mellon University, where he got his Ph.D. in computer science in
1981. At PARC, they joked that you could tell when the hyperactive Nelson
was back for the summer because there were footprints on the ceiling.
   With other researchers in PARC's computer science lab, Nelson defined
the technology known as remote procedure calls (RPC) that underlies the
distributed computing standards the industry will use in the 1990s. But
Nelson does not benefit financially from the companies that have chosen to
use RPCs because Xerox never patented it.
   His PARC co-workers went on to found companies including 3Com Corp.,
Adobe Systems Inc., and Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. Nelson left after
five years at PARC to work for the Australian equivalent of the National
Science Foundation, and then, starting in 1984, spent five more years
helping to found two start-ups.
   The first, Austek Microsystems Ltd., was a U.S.-Australia joint venture,
for which Nelson had both engineering and marketing responsibilities. He
headed up projects as diverse as computer-aided design tools and add-in
graphics boards. Today Austek builds cache controllers for PCs. That Austek
and Auspex have such similar names is a coincidence that sometimes confuses
his friends: Austek is a conjunction of "Australia" and "technology," while
Auspex is the French singular of "auspices" and roughly translates as "a
good omen."
   Nelson left Austek in 1987 with 15 other employees in a "friendly"
spin-off called Cogent Computer Corp. for which Nelson was vice president
of strategic marketing. Cogent's plan was to build a PC that integrated
graphics, networking, and a Windows 2.0 interface-but the plan failed when
Ing. C. Olivetti and Co. withdrew an offer of needed seed money.

No Regrets
Does Nelson have regrets about the five years he dedicated to Austek and
Cogent? "It's not something I dwell on," he says, adding that he learned
some important lessons-even great technical strengths won't overcome
weakness in sales and marketing, for one. "Sales and marketing are
important," he now realizes, "even though it's not what I wanted to hear
then." That's why he considers marketing important these days-too important
to leave to marketing people.
   But you can't write Bruce Nelson off as the personification of Xerox
PARC-a sad reminder of what might have been. For one thing, Nelson is too
intense to be dismissed. He talks fast. When Bob Lyon, vice president of
engineering for Legato Systems Inc., has been on the same dais as Nelson,
he establishes the speed at which Nelson talks at one Nelson, and then
says, "I'm going to speak at 600 milli-Nelsons."
   Nelson is very intense. The story goes that he went off to Australia
with a girlfriend, and a year later she came back proclaiming that she
didn't want to see Australia or Nelson for the rest of her life. He's also
a mechanical whiz. Another ex-girlfriend, now married, says, "I still think
that when something's broken, I'll wait for my husband to leave town so his
feelings won't be hurt, and get Bruce over here to fix it."
   To some people, he's obnoxious-but Nelson is not a glad-hander, and
there's no b.s. given or taken. "People can see him as opinionated," shrugs
a co-worker, "but the guy is so smart and thinks so fast. What comes across
as abrasive is being real direct. He's a real fount of ideas and he has no
qualms about sharing them."

The Quest for Hypeless Marketing
Today, at Auspex and in the industry, Nelson is trying to keep marketing
people honest by whipping their tail up and down so that they get the heck
out of the way of computing.
   Privately held Auspex had 1991 sales of $40 million, and company
officials say it will boost revenue 25 percent this year. It was the first
company to build a high-capacity file server, and one of the first to
suggest that servers should be engineered from the ground up, rather than
just using a retrofitted workstation or PC without a monitor. As chief
technologist, Nelson acts as the technical spokesperson for customers and
at conferences for the file server manufacturer. He has his fingers in all
phases of sales, marketing, and engineering, looking at everything from
benchmarking methodology to evaluating what he calls "make/buy/ally
decisions."
   Nelson is apt to stalk into a competitor's booth at a trade show and
challenge that company's claims. He insists he's found his rivals using
year-old information to make Auspex look bad. And, he insists, he's just as
tough on his own salespeople. "One of my jobs is to be sure of what other
vendors' products do so that our salespeople can be fair about saying
Auspex is better...When I find something egregious, like saying our
price-performance is eight times better than an IBM server, I take it
out."
   One of the ways Nelson has tried to keep his industry honest is by
organizing Laddis. Named for its members-Legato Systems Inc., Auspex,
Digital Equipment Corp., Data General Corp., Interphase Corp., and Sun-the
group's benchmark measures network file system performance and has been
adopted by the System Performance Evaluation Consortium, otherwise known as
SPEC.
   "You need someone to map between what the engineers know and what users
can understand," Nelson says. "Laddis is a way to keep people honest across
the board."
   This marathon talker, some of his colleagues insist, is also a good
listener. Says Auspex President Larry Boucher, "Because of his objectivity,
because he's there to help the customer, he winds up being a real asset."
   In a reflective mood, Nelson gives a hint of self-assessment when he
discusses a one-time co-worker at PARC. "He's not yet an elder statesman of
computer science," he says. "He's one of the brilliant minds that's
remained in the background."
   Like others that came out of PARC, Nelson is not yet famous, but he
still has time to achieve fame and fortune.

SO, YOU WANNA LEARN ABOUT UNIX
Because UNIX and easy-to-learn aren't two phrases you normally put
together, we've compiled a list of eight top books to help you get started

By:
Walter Zintz

Bringing novices up to speed on the UNIX operating system can be a rather
daunting task. When UNIX's command-line prompt pops up on a terminal
screen, the question "Where do I go from here?" pops up in the mind of a
befuddled new user. With a software system as powerful as UNIX, it's
understandable that beginners might be hard-pressed to quickly master its
complexities when armed with only a set of inadequate manuals or poorly
organized books.
   Although friendlier interfaces are available for most of today's newer
systems, they aren't of much help when it's necessary to fix a system
problem or do work beyond the ordinary. There are also a significant number
of existing UNIX systems without graphical interfaces that require
knowledge of such arcane utilities as the vi editor, awk, and grep in order
to do the job. If you don't find the UNIX manuals very helpful, there are
some well-done how-to books that can help fill the gaps.
   There are almost 100 books in print that introduce users to the UNIX
system. The majority are for readers who have no experience with other
computing systems, and hope that they can learn the basics of computing
while learning the basics of UNIX. Most of these books are aimed at people
who just want to learn how to use UNIX for their own work, although there
are some good starter books for system administrators and programmers. This
article will introduce you to what I regard as the eight best choices for
learning both computing and the UNIX system from scratch.
   This collection covers UNIX versions from the early, but still much
used, Version 7 to the latest System V Release 4 (SVR4), as well as popular
variants such as The Santa Cruz Operation's XENIX and UNIX. These books are
written for readers ranging from enthusiastic technical types to people
whose secret wish is that computers would just go away.
   I won't pretend that non-networked systems and character-based terminal
screens are the future of computing-UNIX systems today feature tight-linked
distributed computing and bit-mapped, mouse-controlled, windowed screens.
No introductory UNIX book in print today covers such systems, however. For
now, beginners on those advanced systems will just have to switch back and
forth between any of the following UNIX books and the available network or
GUI information sources.

Introducing the UNIX System
by Henry McGilton and Rachel Morgan
For those who will use a UNIX system primarily for its text processing
utilities, this is one of the two introductory books-the other being UNIX
for People-worth your time, and should also be considered if you want to
become a proficient user without becoming a nerd. Although this book is
based on the older Version 7 of UNIX, introductory UNIX books just don't
come any better.
   The fact that this book starts from scratch and gives coherent
explanations makes it a good choice for even the true beginner. It manages
to go beyond the basics to provide extensive coverage of text editing and
text formatting, as well as a good start on system administration and UNIX
as a programming environment. There's even a solid introduction to shell
scripts.
   Despite the amount of ground covered, there is never any feeling of
being rushed. The authors have the knack of taking just a few words to say
something clearly enough that it does not need to be repeated. The book has
a lot of information on the ubiquitous vi editor and its alter ego, ex, as
well as the ed and sed editors. Even with this ambitious list, the authors
manage to go into enough detail that readers can become quite expert at
online editing. The same holds true for coverage of nroff, a cryptic
non-WYSIWYG text formatter, the ms macro package for taming nroff, and the
tbl preprocessor for creating tables.
   There are no nasty surprises when you start to get down to work, either.
The authors almost never forget to mention the exceptions to rules that
would otherwise appear to haunt you in real-life use. And while no how-to
book is completely free of technical mistakes, this one comes amazingly
close-better than any other introductory book I've encountered.
   There is one detracting factor: this book is specific to UNIX version 7,
with an extra chapter on some of the Berkeley UNIX extensions. Version 7 is
the direct antecedent of almost all UNIX versions presently available, but
the systems that use Version 7 or a clone today usually call it something
else. Current descendants have new or extended utilities that aren't
covered, but the book is still hard to top for learning the basics of UNIX
before getting into specific versions.
   Don't confuse this book with Introducing UNIX System V by the same
authors: the books appear similar, but are quite different inside.

The UNIX Operating System, second edition
by Kaare Christian
This book is my choice for software developers who are brand new to UNIX,
but knowledgeable about computing in general. This group of users will like
the book's slant toward UNIX as a programming environment, and the
explanations of why various aspects of UNIX are the way they are.
   Shell programming and editing in vi are the techniques most thoroughly
discussed. As for discussion of UNIX internals, it's mostly about the file
system, the Bourne shell, and the kernel. There are also chapters on
benchmarking-complete with a benchmark shell script-and the relationships
between UNIX, PCs, and DOS.
   Beyond that, the book focuses on explaining approximately 100 utilities.
But this book is a supplement, not a substitute, for the manuals-it most
often restricts itself to peripheral advice on the best way to use a
particular utility, and comments on how and why the utility became what it
is.
   For an ambitious non-UNIX programmer, this book should be ample
preparation for The UNIX Programming Environment by Kernighan and Pike. The
ordinary programmer needn't go that far: this book explains as much about
UNIX for programmers as necessary.

UNIX for People
by Peter M. Birns, Patrick B. Brown, and John C.C. Muster
This is the book that will rescue people who don't get along well with
computers-it's written for people whose field of expertise is something
other than computing. The book's pace is not too fast, no experience in
computing is assumed, and the tone is mellow and understanding throughout.
Explanations are explicit and thorough, and frequent reminders reinforce
what's already been covered.
   This book's greatest strength is in its skillful presentation of
information. In the course of their varied careers, the three authors got
as far as Ph.D. candidacies in education and/or psychology, and they use
what they've learned to make a dry, technical subject easier to learn.
   On top of that, this is one of the two books I enthusiastically
recommend to people who want to specialize in the text-processing end of
UNIX use. In this area, the book improves on McGilton and Morgan's book in
certain ways, such as dropping coverage of the obsolete ed editor in favor
of the important troff text formatter. As for general UNIX use, it covers
most people's needs.
   This book's 29 chapters-enhanced with various learning aids, and
supplemented by features such as "roadmaps" that demystify certain command
transitions-make up a good basic education in UNIX. Readers who want to go
farther-without giving up the embedded learning techniques-can contact the
authors about the set of follow-on modules they've self-published.

A Practical Guide to UNIX System V second edition
by Mark G. Sobell
One of the strong points of this book is that Sobell is not a UNIX
cheerleader-he admits the system has problems as well as benefits.
Nonetheless, he has written a fine book for fairly technical readers who
want both a text and a reference manual.
   Sobell has made significant improvements since the first edition by
bringing in topic experts to critique and sometimes rewrite chapters. The
result is a well-rounded book.
   First and foremost comes a text section that occupies almost two-thirds
of the book, and moves the reader pretty far along on everything of
importance to users, as well as introduces the programming environment and
system administration. Then, distinguished by black page-edge indexing,
comes one of Sobell's specialities: reference pages for a large number of
commands and utilities, complete with examples. Don't confuse these with
the official, cryptic man pages provided in UNIX documentation-these lucid
pages are more like what the man pages should have been.
   The book's technical level is rather broad. Thoughtful beginners should
have little trouble with the explanations, especially if they pay attention
to each chapter's introduction, summary, and exercises. Likewise, people
with considerable computing experience on other systems should not find
this book slow or pablum.

Peter Norton's Guide to UNIX
by Peter Norton and Harley Hahn
This book is aimed at complete beginners, especially those who are serious
about learning both computing and UNIX well. The authors make it clear from
the start that using UNIX should be fun. They're right, of course, and none
of the other introductory technical UNIX books I've seen encourages this
fact.
   The writing style is slow, engaging, and helpful. By the time they reach
the end of the book, readers will be at the upper apprentice level and
well-grounded in the basics. The explanations of the ASCII code are by far
the most lucid and complete I've encountered in any beginner's book on
UNIX. Sidelights on UNIX history and philosophy are sprinkled throughout,
which serves as another tool to keep the book from seeming dry.
   The book includes frequent comparisons to DOS, which makes it a good
candidate for those who are moving to UNIX from DOS. My only reservation is
that the number of technical errors is a little higher than usual amongthe
books on this list.

Using UNIX
by David W. Solomon, Tanya Rodrigue, Mark Schulman, Rosemary Colonna,
Dennis Fairclough, and David H. Lender
This is a good choice if your company is only willing to buy one book on
UNIX SVR4 for everyone in the company below the level of UNIX guru. It
starts out talking to readers who don't know exactly what a computer is,
and is filled with clear explanations, screen dumps, and other
illustrations.
   The book never bogs down at the simplest level: well before the
midpoint, the concept of file block sizes as they relate to space wastage
and file fragmentation is introduced. The book provides frequent
comparisons to DOS, but you need not know that system to follow this book
easily.
   A reader choosing an introductory book for personal use might also
select this book. After the first few chapters, sections can be taken
individually, which allows you to dip into it as needed.

UNIX System V Release 4: An Introduction
by Kenneth H. Rosen, Richard R. Rosinski and James M. Farber
This volume's huge 1,228-page count is devoted to explaining just about
everything about SVR4 except the guru stuff. After covering the usual
beginner topics in great detail, it goes on to specialized matters like
security, network administration, and running UNIX along with DOS. The
result is a book with a lot to say to every serious reader, from the
complete computer neophyte to the fairly advanced intermediate.
   The writing is reasonably clear, although it is a little dry, and
written at the right level for determined beginners or ordinary
intermediate users. The page allows plenty of room for extended
explanations, sidelights, comparisons to DOS, and reference material. My
primary reservation is that the frequency of technical errors is high. It's
not any worse than the average introductory UNIX books, but it is
noticeably below the standard set by the rest of the books in my top
eight.

Using SCO UNIX
by Geoffrey T. LeBlond, William B. LeBlond, Sheila R. Blust, Wes Modes,
and Ross Oliver
This isthe book I recommend to people involved with XENIX and UNIX from The
Santa Cruz Operation. It's a very good book on UNIX with a lot of
SCO-specific information as a bonus.
   This is the only book in my top eight that offers help with installing
the system software on a new computer. Another pleasant surprise is the
inclusion of chapters on constructing filters, understanding SCO business
software, dealing with uucp, and running DOS under UNIX.
   The technical range is medium, and the writing accessible to fairly
astute beginners. After reading the entire book, the reader will be well
into intermediate user status. Skimming is pretty safe because the authors
use icons in the margin to draw attention to points that shouldn't be
glossed over.
   Those who like its style, but have other variants of System V, should
turn to Using UNIX System V Release 3, which is also published by
Osborne/McGraw-Hill and has essentially the same structure.

Other Resources
Although there are seminars and video courses galore available, some of
which are quite good, they are unnecessary when books like these are
available. A judicious selection from among these books should get any
beginner off to a great start.

LIVING THE UNIX LIFE

By:
W.Z.

While you're using one of the books discussed in this article to learn the
technical side of UNIX, don't neglect the broader aspects of the system.
   Over the decades, a tradition, community, and style have developed
around UNIX. The most pleasant way to introduce yourself to all this is to
pick up a copy of Life with UNIX: A Guide for Everyone by Don Libes and
Sandy Ressler, published by Prentice Hall.
   Their book provides plenty of history, mixed with tidbits of gossip, as
well as guidance toward printed information, industry events, the Internet,
services, and application packages. An abundance of contact information is
provided along with realistic evaluations of what's mentioned. There's a
chapter on how UNIX is faring in the larger world of general computing that
features the cons as well as the pros of the UNIX system, and another that
fearlessly predicts future directions. Technical aspects of UNIX are
overviewed in three chapters.
   Best of all, it's a no-pain, no-strain read. The writing style is breezy
and buoyant. Even if I weren't involved with UNIX, I could see myself
reading this as an evening's diversion-it's more gripping than the average
paperback novel. I doubt I'll ever see this book's equal as an entre into a
computer user community.

UNIX NETWORKS GIVE PCS TRUE POWER

By:
Darrin Brown

One of the most pressing needs for businesses today is to connect DOS
systems to high-speed UNIX networks. It's a marriage of opposites, but it's
also one of necessity-and one that has numerous products lining up at the
altar. So we looked at three major DOS suppliers of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
all-important Network File System (NFS).
   Why is NFS so important for PC users? It, and the underlying TCP/IP
network transport mechanism, gives a childlike simplicity to sharing files
and running programs on remote systems. For DOS users, NFS is a no-brainer:
anyone who can copy a file from one drive to another is an NFS champ.
   We tested NFS and TCP/IP network software by FTP Software Inc. called
PC/TCP Plus, Sun's own PC-NFS, and 3Com Corp.'s 3Com TCP with DPA. We found
PC/TCP Plus to be the better performing product at $490, although the more
expensive-up to $665-PC-NFS is the best choice for users of Microsoft
Corp.'s Microsoft Windows. The 3Com TCP product, while functional, falls
short in working with the UNIX environment because of its leaning toward a
DOS peer-to-peer network design.
   We chose to review the FTP and Sun products because of their undeniable
stature. For contrast, we chose 3Com's TCP because of the company's good
name in the DOS market. Other vendors with TCP/IP and NFS products that
could have easily qualified for this review include Atlantix Corp.,
Distinct Corp., James River Group Inc., Network Research Corp., Novell
Inc., Structured Software Solutions Inc., and Wollongong Group Inc.
(Editors' note: We will review products from several of these vendors in
the future.)
   In addition to NFS support, each of the reviewed products offers access
to remote computer systems and the ability to quickly and easily transfer
files from one system to another. PC/TCP and PC-NFS also offer an e-mail
facility. These basic functions allow people, not just computer systems, to
interact more efficiently.
   Our test network consisted of a 66-MHz 486 system from Sprite Inc. (San
Jose, Calif.), a 25-MHz 386 from Everex Systems Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), and
an IBM Corp. PS/2 Model 70. A Sun IPC acted as the common server for the
PCs running Sun's PC-NFS daemon. Also on the network were a Nextstation
from Next Computer Inc., a SPARCbook notebook computer from Tadpole
Technologies plc. (Cambridge, England), a model 9000/710 workstation from
Hewlett-Packard Co., and a TX100 X terminal from Visual Technology Inc.
(Westboro, Mass.). We used thin coaxial cable-Thinnet-as our network
medium.
   Our objective was to determine which software product provides the best
NFS and TCP/IP service to a standard Ethernet network. We also considered
the network interface cards that create the physical network connection,
because they are essential to network communication. The PS/2 was included
in our network so we could test Microchannel interface cards in addition to
the 16-bit cards for the extended industry-standard architecture buses on
the Sprite and Everex systems. We tested cards and software alike under DOS
3.3, DOS 5.0, and Microsoft Windows.

The NFS Advantage
NFS was developed by Sun in 1984 to provide transparent access to files on
the network. Under NFS, designated directory hierarchies appear to be local
to all connected systems. Importantly, the design of NFS gives users almost
identical file access performance-with up to a 20 percent reduction
possible-compared to local hard disk access. NFS also provides graceful
crash recovery and supports network printers, plotters, scanners, and tape
drives, among other devices.
   For open systems computing, the most important aspect of NFS is that it
supports multiple operating systems, including UNIX, DOS, VMS, and Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Transparent file access is enabled by allowing
multiple nodes on a network to become servers by sharing or exporting their
local file systems. These servers must be true multitasking
machines-meaning they must be able to run several daemons simultaneously,
such as nfsd, pcnfsd, and mountd.
   NFS client systems mount the exported file systems and assign a
seemingly local drive or directory name to the remote mount point. On our
test DOS systems, we used a variety of drive letters. Allowing the client
to use its own naming conventions a strong point of NFS.
   Crash recovery is straightforward. If the server goes down, the client
hangs if it is hard-mounted, or times out the connection if it is
soft-mounted. In either case, when the server comes back online, it picks
up where it left off. In other words, the server is stateless-meaning it
retains no client state information. If the server crashes before sending
an acknowledgement to the client, the client retransmits when the server
comes up.
   The ability to mount exported file systems lets you centralize all types
of information in common drives and directories. This saves time and
effort, especially when you are working with archives, backups, and general
disaster recovery techniques, such as mirroring or data searching. If you
use a relational database on the network, you can access information
anywhere on the network in seconds.

PC/TCP Plus
FTP's PC/TCP Plus comes complete with option-rich commands and an
impressive collection of networking utilities. PC/TCP Plus offers more
commands, and a more in-depth configuration and operation than the other
products reviewed-at $490 compared to the $665 for the three Sun modules
that give you equal features.
   The drawback to PC/TCP Plus is its complex installation and
configuration procedure. PC/TCP Plus requires the network administrator to
have previous UNIX or NFS knowledge. The documentation doesn't help
matters: We found FTP's manuals to contain many details, but overall, they
were poorly organized.
   PC/TCP Plus is available for both DOS and OS/2 operating systems and
comes with FTP's NFS product, Interdrive. PC/TCP Plus supports both
peer-to-peer and PC-to-multitasking system connections. It supports simple
network management protocol (SNMP), fiber distributed data interface,
point-to-point protocol, serial line internet protocol, X.25, LAN Manager
over Token Ring (IEEE 802.5), TCP/IP over Class 1 Ethernet (DIX), Class 11
Ethernet (IEEE 802.2 and 802.3), and IPX from Netware.
   Configuring PC/TCP Plus relies on two major files: IFCUST.SYS, which
primarily describes hardware and its associated base memory addresses and
interrupt assignments; and IPCUST.SYS, which contains internet protocol
(IP) information and sets preferences and network defaults.

Going Remote
PC/TCP Plus support for remote connections is excellent. Performing a
remote login on a PC/TCP Plus system is remarkably similar to using a UNIX
workstation. Because rsh and rexec are part of PC/TCP Plus' entourage of
utilities, we could use familiar commands to log into other systems.
Conversely, Sun provides only telnet and single-command rsh service.
   Beyond log-in sessions, utilities like rmt (remote tape manipulation),
tar, and ddates give you an excellent way to backup and archive data on the
PC to a network tape drive, optical disk, or file system; and to record
these events for future reference and scheduling. The PC/TCP Plus inet
command is also effective for displaying information about internet control
message protocol statistics, TCP connections, IP routing, and the Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) table if in use.
   The daemon for PC/TCP Plus iscalled ftpserv. The big difference between
ftpserv and Sun's pcnfs daemon is that ftpserv lets you set up a PC to act
as a server. This is a boon for PC users who want to share files between
PCs without going through the UNIX server.
   Included with the PC/TCP Plus package is a copy of the pcnfsd source
code and a makefile file utility to assist with the compilation of code.
The instructions for installing the supplied daemon are vague but
adequate.
   We liked the way PC/TCP Plus uses the available memory on a PC. By
letting you dynamically unload the protocol stack-or other network related
utilities in memory-you can use the memory-resident idrive program without
rebooting the system when you want to turn it off.
   Other PC/TCP Plus commands deserving honorable mention are: rloginvt and
rlogingl, which support up to 10 virtual sessions; smtpsrv, an e-mail
server daemon that lets you use a PC as a mail server or gateway; and rcp,
which lets you set the umask value from the command line. Additionally, FTP
provides an extensive collection of terminal emulators including VT52,
VT100, VT220, and IBM 3270.
   PC/TCP Plus is a diamond in the rough: its installation, configuration,
and operability are not polished. PC administrators will also need to take
a crash course in UNIX basics. However, PC/TCP Plus is an extremely
functional UNIX-like set of network tools for the PC-and it will appeal to
UNIX administrators who have suddenly found PCs in their midst.

PC-NFS
Everyone in the UNIX community who knows networking knows of Sun's PC-NFS.
And, in an attempt to maintain that market position, Sunselect began
shipping PC-NFS for DOS and Microsoft Windows in March.
   We definitely like PC-NFS. It is a well-crafted product and has a decent
Microsoft Windows interface. We would have appreciated a more icon-based
access to some of its utilities, but what you get is exceptionally
well-designed and functional. All in all, PC-NFS is a close runner-up to
FTP's product.
   The base PC-NFS lacks two important features that youdo get with FTP's
PC/TCP Plus. PC-NFS does not support file transfer protocol server
capability for PC-to-PC access. This capability is needed for DOS users on
the UNIX network to transfer files directly to other DOS systems. Without
FTP support, you must store the files you wish to share on the UNIX
server.
   Another shortcoming of the base package is its lack of back-up and
e-mail utilities, although it does have a basic messaging service. You can
boost the usefulness of PC-NFS with two $125 add-on package that, among
other things, give you enhanced mail features and various terminal
emulators.

Solid Software
Despite Sunselect's pricing scheme, the overall PC-NFS environment offers
most of the features you need. The product's well-styled interface and
exceptional documentation also give you a secure feeling that Sun knows PC
users-something you have to wonder about with FTP.
   The DOS version of PC-NFS comes with most of the utilities you would
expect: ftp, telnet, dos2unix, unix2dos, finger, ping, rcp, and rsh, among
others. Noticeably missing is the rlogin utility, and the available rsh
does not support a live login, which leaves telnet as the only login
choice.
   In the Microsoft Windows module, you are greeted with icons labeled Ftp,
Telnet, Netstat, Messaging, and Ping. When you execute any of these, the
familiar character-mode version of the program runs, except for Messaging,
which has a Microsoft Windows interface. We found all the utilities to work
effectively.
   What we really like about the Windows version is its full support for
network drives. The Window File Manager program, for example, prominently
displayed all our network drives at the top of its main window. By clicking
on a drive label, we instantly received a graphical depiction of the
mounted file system on our server. Additionally, the Windows Print Manager
program worked well on our network. PC-NFS printing functions include
high-speed spooling to network printers and the ability to share local PC
printers with other network users. You can also use Windows to access
printers via the Windows control panel.
   PC-NFS uses several memory resident programs (TSRs), including SNMP;
listener, a messaging program; pcnfslpd, a PC print server; and prt.com, a
network printing program.
   Version four of PC-NFS includes the source code, makefile, and
installation scripts for version two of pcnfsd. The earlier pcnfsd daemon,
which is still in widespread use, was designed to provide user
authentication and basic network printing services. The new daemon provides
enhanced printing and user authentication services, as well as support for
Microsoft Windows. Sun provides detailed instructions on installing server
daemons, including compilation instructions for PCNFSD on an IBM RS/6000.
   PC-NFS is a polished, user-friendly product. Its installation and
configuration routines work effectively for users of all levels. The
documentation is well presented. In addition, Sun has done an excellent job
with its support of Microsoft Windows. PC-NFS's list price is too high,
however, and as a result, we think it is best suited for sites just
beginning to install DOS-to-UNIX networking.

3Com TCP
3Com TCP, with 3Com NFS, offers easy installation, good documentation, and
an impressive array of network commands. The product shows versatility by
working with different servers, including TCP/IP, NFS, Novell Netware,
Microsoft LAN Manager, and 3Com's own 3+Open LAN Manager and 3+Share
products.
   The versatility doesn't carry through to 3Com's TCP product,
however-unless you're accustomed to using one of 3Com's server products.
3Com offers many of the same UNIX-like networking commands, but its syntax
for specifying options is unlike UNIX itself.
   3Com TCP with DPA is available for both DOS and OS/2. It offers minimal
terminal support, but we did like its Demand Protocol Architecture (DPA), a
PC memory management feature. With DPA, you can load and unload the network
protocol stacks from memory, which is advantageous when you need to free up
memory for other software, especially if you use memory-resident tools.
   Installation of TCP is easy, but we didn't appreciate the four levels of
subdirectories it creates. We also didn't like the product's assumption
that we had the 3+Open LAN Manager. The software creates this directory if
you choose install option one. If you choose option two, it creates a
directory for the Microsoft LAN Manager. Either directory adds an
unnecessary 43 characters to the system path. At publication time, 3Com
informed us that Version 2.0 of TCP would correct these problems.
   Lastly, we should note TCP runs under Microsoft Windows, but does not
support the nfssetup, ping, arp, and tstat commands. These programs must be
run in one of Microsoft Window's full-screen, character-mod windows. (If
you haven't had the experience, don't look forward to it.)
   3Com's product is most successful in its general functionality, overall
documentation, and compatibility with a wide range of network
configurations and protocols. But we found everything geared more toward a
peer-to-peer network design that emphasizes coexistence with 3+Open LAN
Manager, Microsoft LAN Manager, and Novell Netware.

A Good Marriage
Like a good marriage, the better the underlying mechanism, the smoother the
experience. Right now, with FTP's PC/TCP Plus and Sun's PC-NFS, you can be
sure you're walking to the altar at the right time. We think 3Com's TCP
needs a better UNIX orientation, but current 3Com users should strongly
consider it.
   When it gets to money, matrimony is a matter of bargaining positions.
Each product is sold on a per CPU basis, so multiple copies can be
expensive, especially when compared to DOS products. On this score, even if
you're getting a quantity discount, FTP is sure to score heavily.
   DOS users might get frustrated with FTP's product because of its
command-line orientation and complex configuration, but current UNIX
administrators won't mind. If you're looking for a simple marriage,
consider PC-NFS without prejudice-it's the beginning of an exciting new
interface for NFS.
   FTP's product provides the most extensive collection of commands,
terminal emulators, and networking utilities for command-line shops, and
its DOS server capability is impressive. So if you have the know how, you
won't hear any wedding bell blues.

ITS IN THE CARDS

By:
D.B.

In the PC market, network cards are commodity items. Buying decisions can
boil down to whether or not the vendor includes a T-connector in the box.
We entered this fray to look at three vendors with established reputations
and products: 3Com Corp., Standard Microsystems Corp. (SMC), and Cabletron
Systems Inc.
We compared 16-bit cards rather than 32- or eight-bit cards because they
offer the best combination of compatibility, price, and performance. We
chose Thinnet cable cards for similar reasons: reliability, pricing, and
convenience. We could have chosen 10Base-T, but despite its compact design
and superior convenience, we think Thinnet is a good choice for businesses
with small networks because of its low cost and technical merits.
   We evaluated cards that support the standard PC industry-standard
architecture (ISA) bus, as well as the Microchannel architecture used by
IBM PS/2 systems.
   The 3Com products are sold under the name Etherlink and are our first
pick because they provide the best installation and configuration software.
The downside to the Etherlink cards is they are the most expensive-priced
at $425, compared to the $296 and $249 offerings from Cabletron and SMC.
   The Etherlink 16 supports ISA systems and the EtherlinkMC supports
Microchannel systems. Both cards include a boot ROM socket, 64 kilobytes of
on-board memory, simple network management protocol (SNMP) support, both
thicknet and Thinnet connection, a Thinnet T-connector, and menu-driven
software for installation and configuration. The documentation on
installation, diagnostics, error messages, and trouble shooting is
impressive.
   The limited lifetime warranty for both products covers hardware and
software. Technical support is provided through dealers, Compuserve, fax,
and a telephone hot line.
   The Cabletron cards are called Desktop Network Interface (DNI) and
suffer from poor documentation. Model E2112 supports ISA and model E3112
supports Microchannel. We also learned about several other models in the
documentation because Cabletron crams the descriptions of six cards into a
single manual.
   The DNI cards feature boot ROM, 16 kilobytes of on-board RAM, SNMP
support, and thicknet and Thinnet connections, as well as 10Base-T (RJ-45)
connections. The cards use LEDs to indicate power status, network
collisions, and transmit and receive status. The software comes with Cmail,
an unloadable e-mail utility.
   No automated installation utility comes with the DNI cards, which means
you must copy the appropriate files to your hard drive and edit the system
start-up files. The board can be configured manually using switches and
jumpers, or electronically with the packet driver configuration utility.
   The DNI cards come with a one-year warranty. Free user support is
provided on a toll-free support line. Online support is available through
Compuserve, UNIX e-mail, anonymous FTP, and a 24-hour bulletin board.
   Probably the most popular cards of those we reviewed are SMC's Ethercard
Plus cards, which sell for $249 and $349. The reason these are popular is
SMC purchased the LAN communications business unit of Western Digital Inc.
last year, and Western Digital's name had become synonymous with PC network
cards.
   The Ethercard Plus products-the Elite/16 for ISA systems and the Elite/A
for Microchannel systems-come with the same basic features as the other
products. Both have boot ROM sockets, 16 kilobytes of on-board memory, LEDs
that signal transmit and receive, thicknet and Thinnet connections, and a T
connector. Both cards are also software configurable, but have optional
jumper-based settings.
   SMC has the most reasonably priced card of any major network vendor, and
there is a five-year warranty on the Ethercard Plus products. This is a
nice touch, but all in all, we still prefer the 3Com products because they
provide the best installation and configuration utilities.

MORE APPLE TO UNIX CONNECTIVITY
Uaccess veils UUCP's complexity in a Macintosh e-mail hub

By:
Andrew D. Wolfe Jr.

It's hard to imagine technologies as disparate as the highly usable
Macintosh from Apple Computer Inc. and the obtuse UUCP mail system.
Fortunately, Ice Engineering Inc. has created a complete UUCP system for
the Mac that not only works, but is easy to use-Uaccess ($375) for network
servers, and Uaccesslite ($195) for network clients and standalone
systems.
   With Uaccess, you can easily compose, send, and receive mail on a
Macintosh. Uaccess supports the two common forms of UNIX mail
addressing-domain addressing (user@company.com) and UUCP addressing
(!system1!system2!user). You can have any number of windows open to compose
and read messages. To view a list of messages received, you open a mail
in-box. Each message is marked by a small icon that indicates if the
message is a regular message or a reply, and whether it has been read,
saved to a text file, or marked for deletion.
   Uaccess operates like conventional UUCP by spooling mail and executing
in batch mode after connecting to a remote system, but surprisingly it can
also answer remote UUCP calls in the background, turning the Mac into a
genuine UUCP mail server. This places Uaccess ahead of DOS products such as
UUlink from Vortex Technology (Topanga, Calif.).
   Icons in a floating "Functions" window provide common mail
manipulations, including compose letter, reply, forward, and delete.
Uaccess also supports Usenet news interchange, and lets you review, post,
and follow up articles in a newsgroup in the same way you handle mail.
Uaccess sends and receives files via UUCP. The user identifies source and
target files through a series of dialog boxes and can select raw data, data
with newline translation, and Macbinary formats when sending.
   Uaccess provides numerous file conversion operations, including Stuffit
compression and decompression, Macbinary and Binhex encoding and decoding,
as well as DOS and UNIX conversion. It also provides the uuencode and
uudecode translators used for sending and receiving binary data over UUCP
networks. These translators are omitted from Uaccesslite.
   Uaccess is easy, but tedious, to configure. You face 18 different dialog
boxes, some of which you revisit several times, and it is often difficult
to find the specific option you want. For example, to set the automatic
dial option, you must wind your way through two menus and two dialog boxes.
This causes you to rely heavily on the documentation. Fortunately, the
user's guide is comprehensive and well-indexed.
   Uaccess turns Macintosh computers into full UUCP hosts, and can in fact
implement a local UUCP network among Macintoshes using Appletalk, while
still providing interchange with remote UUCP hosts via modem.
Non-networked, or client-only, Macs can be outfitted with Uaccesslite, but
in order to provide a gateway between Appletalk networks and outside UUCP
systems, you must buy Uaccess.
   Flexible is the most concise way to describe Uaccess. Important
operations have command-key accelerators, but the menus aren't cluttered
accelerator notations. Mail, news, and communications have their own menus
and make the most common functions immediately accessible. Uaccess also
makes use of Apple's "Balloon Help" to provide information about menus,
icons, and dialog boxes. Uaccess also you to customize your mail operations
by attaching other programs to it.
   All in all, Uaccess is a solid product that turns a Mac network into a
full e-mail system that supports UUCP. You cannot use Uaccess to send
graphics, as some Mac mail systems do, but Uaccess is nonetheless an
excellent way to achieve connectivity between Apple Macintosh and UNIX
systems.

icons to show the status of each mail message.

LOW-COST GRAPHICS FOR THE MASSES
The Maxstation is a cheap way for four users to access text and
graphics-based programs on a SCO UNIX system

By:
Rick Farris

It's a common problem-how do you network your accounting department or
secretarial pool without diving into a Novell Inc. network? Priced at $795
for the central controller, plus $199 for each user module, Maxstation from
Maxpeed Corp. provides powerful incentive to choose the UNIX option.
   At $1,595 for a controller card and four base units, a fully configured
Maxstation controller gives four users access to The Santa Cruz Operation's
Open Desktop. You do have to settle for 720-by348-pixel monochrome
graphics, however. And count on spending another $200 per user for
keyboard, monitor, and mouse. We found the aesthetics of a green-screen X
display to be questionable, but the ability to display graphics means that
WYSIWYG word processing and simple graphics are available for the same
price as an ASCII terminal. At publication time, Maxpeed was also slated to
ship a cover VGA model.
   The Maxstation consists of a controller card that fits in your computer
and up to four base units that resemble a terminal base. Up to four
controllers can be installed in each computer for a total of 16 Maxstation
users. Each base unit has connections for a keyboard, monitor, mouse, and
parallel printer-all of which you supply. The mouse port is a
general-purpose buffered serial port and can also be used to attach a
modem, scanner, plotter, or even a traditional terminal.
   Perfectly good terminals can be purchased for $400 or less, but the
Maxstation has one feature that terminals can't match-graphics. Because the
Maxstation emulates console graphics and uses PC keyboards, applications
work exactly as they do on the console monitor. For instance, using SCO's
DOS emulator, a DOS version of Wordperfect Corp.'s Wordperfect can be run
on the Maxstation, complete with graphical print-preview and function- and
alt-key support.
   What makes the pricing of the Maxstation so attractive is that it
includes the cost of the multiport serial card that would be required to
connect terminals to your system. Viewed in that light, an incremental cost
of $300 per user for graphics and full console support is outstanding. You
hook up base units with twisted-pair wire. The maximum distance a base unit
can be located from the controller is 400 feet.
   The Maxstation does have its shortcomings. Unlike its competitors-Fiber
Optic Station by Sun River Corp. (Austin, Texas) and The Unterminal from
Advanced Micro Research Inc. (San Jose, Calif.)-the Maxstation provides
only Hercules-compatible (720-by-348 pixel) monochrome graphics. And if
you're not running an SCO product, you can forget about the Maxstation. It
is only available for SCO's UNIX, XENIX/386, and Open Desktop. The
Maxstation also requires that you provide your own keyboard ($50 to $100)
and monochrome monitor ($75 to $100). Maxpeed also offers a $1,495
Maxstation with eight ports to service 32 users.
   One of the Maxstation's selling points is that it runs Open Desktop on a
regular monochrome monitor. In our tests, it worked as advertised, but
don't plan having on more than two or three users use Open Desktop at the
same time. Each user runs a copy of the X server and the Motif window
manager, and running three copies of each brings a 486 to its knees. On the
other hand, on a 33-MHz 386 equipped with 16 megabytes of RAM, four
Maxstations easily ran Wordperfect in character mode.
   The Maxstation is a good, inexpensive way to connect an accounting
department running multiuser financial software or a medium-sized
word-processing department. Management information systems managers in
these markets will be pleased with the Maxstation. Those looking for a
cheap replacement for X terminals need to keep looking, because several X
sessions create too big a drain on the central computer. But the Maxstation
is a character-mode champ, by all means.

Desktop-monochrome graphics and all.

THE POWER OF POSIX THINKING
How to simplify porting to the portable system interface

By:
John Sovereign

Posix, the portable operating system interface for computer environments,
is the combined effort of several groups that want to standardize the
interface of the UNIX operating system. Posix pulls together the /usr/group
Standard, the X/Open Company's Portability Guide (XPG) System Interface
(XSI), and AT&T Computer Systems' System V Interface Definition (SVID).
Posix is also one of the few subjects that the open systems consortia, the
Open Software Foundation (OSF) and UNIX International, agree on.
   The Posix interface is even appearing on non-UNIX systems, including
Digital Equipment Corp.'s VMS and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s MPE. Its popularity
is due, in part, to its adoption by the U.S. government as Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) number 151-1. The Posix system
interface is also the cornerstone of the federal government's Application
Portability Profile. In the spring of 1991, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) started certifying vendors' systems as
Posix-compliant. The system interface has also been adopted by the
International Standards Organization (ISO) as document 9945-1.
   For software developers, the result of all this activity is a
platform-independent programming interface designed to support application
portability. I will describe some of the new Posix system interfaces that
may differ from the interfaces you are familiar with, and show you how to
make C-language applications more portable by using the new Posix
interfaces.

The Royal Family of Portability
Posix is actually a family of standards that has been under development by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a
professional organization that promotes standards for hardware and
software, since 1985. The Posix activities are designated as IEEE Project
1003. The base operating system interface is the first standard completed
by the Posix committees and is referred to as 1003.1, or Posix.1. Other
standards currently in progress address networking services, security,
real-time extensions, and administration.
   The Posix.1 interfaces are currently described as C language functions
and header files. There are Ada and Fortran versions of the Posix.1
interfaces as well as a language-independent description that is currently
under development. Along with a C language-dependent addendum, this
language-independent version should replace the current, C-centric standard
without changing the semantics of the interfaces described.
   Posix.1 does not require that the C programming environment provided by
an implementation comply with the ANSI/ISO C standard. Nor do the function
interfaces and header files depend on any additions to the language
invented by the C standard. Several of the C library functions defined by
Posix.1 are the subject of the C standard, but the majority are based on
historical implementations-System V and BSD, for example-and are not
required to provide standard C behavior unless the implementation claims to
conform to the C standard as well as Posix.1.
   The operating system interfaces described in Posix.1 serve as the base
for the most recent versions of the application programming interfaces
(APIs) developed by the open systems consortia: the XPG, SVID, and OSF's
Application Environment Specification. Each of these documents describes
additional services outside the scope of Posix.1, but many are undergoing
standardization at IEEE and elsewhere.

Using the Posix.1 Interface
The good news is, like any good standard, Posix.1 is based on existing
practice, and borrows functionality from System V Release 3 (SVR3) and
recent releases of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Therefore,
most application code that runs on any of the various flavors of UNIX
already conforms to the standard.
   The Posix.1 standard is organized into 10 chapters or sections. The
first section provides an introduction and defines general terms used in
the standard; the second defines terminology and global constants used to
describe the system services. The remaining eight sections describe
functional interfaces. Most of the work done by the Posix.1 committee was
necessary to resolve conflicts between the different flavors of UNIX, or to
provide backward compatibility where defects in the historical designs
required changes. There are a few areas where the standard doesn't match
any existing interface. These are: Signal Mechanisms, Sessions and Job
Control, and Terminal I/O Interfaces.
   Before addressing these areas in more detail, I want to introduce
another important invention from the Posix.1 committee: the conformance
document. Earlier standards did not require vendors to describe the details
of their implementations, but Posix.1 defines such a document and its
content.

Using the Posix.1 Conformance Document
Reading standards documents is like reading ballot propositions-the
language is legalistic, stilted, and full of jargon and loopholes. An
important aid is a conformance document. The Posix.1 standard requires
system vendors to provide conformance documents to programmers and other
laypersons. A vendor's Posix conformance document (PCD) must describe the C
language environment provided by the implementation, other optional
features, and the behavior of the system which the standard allows to be
implementation-defined. While this information should be included in a
vendor's system documentation, the PCD should also be available from the
vendor as a standalone document.
   For example, Posix.1 does not require that implementations support a
process' membership in multiple groups. This aspect is borrowed almost
verbatim from the functionality introduced by BSD. The C-preprocessor
constant NGROUPSMAX defines the number of groups to which a process may
belong; an implementation must provide the value of this constant in the
header file <limits.h> and in the PCD. FIPS 151-1 requires that NGROUPSMAX
be greater than eight. Posix.1 also provides the function sysconf to allow
applications to query the value of this and other system limits at
run-time.
   If your application needs to use multiple groups to provide multiple
levels of security, it does not strictly conform to Posix.1, but may still
be a "conforming application" if you provide information that describes
this dependency to users. Armed with PCDs from competing system vendors,
you and your customers can determine which systems can support your
application.
   Similarly, Posix.1 does not require that a system limit file names to a
particular length. But the standard does require all implementations to
support file names of at least 14 bytes and to advertise the maximum number
supported in the PCD, programmatically in the pathconf interface, and the
constant NAMEMAX defined in the header file <limits.h>, if the maximum
number is fixed for all file systems supported by the implementation. Other
limits may vary due to system configuration and, therefore, may be excluded
from the header file. You must use the sysconf or pathconf functions at
run-time for these limits.
   In this case, if your application requires functionality greater than
that required by the standard-you need to represent file names up to 32
bytes-Posix.1 does not consider this significant enough to warrant
exception to the requirements of a conforming application. Your application
should determine if the limitation exists on the platform it is running on
and provide a suitable work-around.
   The first thing you need to know from a vendor's PCD is how to compile
your application in the system's Posix environment. Because most Posix
implementations are based on existing systems, the default application
environment is probably designed to be compatible with older applications
and may not be Posix compliant. On such a system, requesting the Posix
application environment may be as simple as adding another library to the
command line that you use to invoke the compiler or linker. Accessing the
Posix environment should be one of the first subjects addressed in a PCD.

Signals
Posix signals are based largely on BSD's signal delivery and receipt
mechanisms. The principal advantage of the BSD model is reliable reception
of signals: the signal catching function is not required to "re-arm"
itself, which avoids a potential race condition with another occurrence of
the same signal. Posix.1 changed the names of the BSD interfaces to protect
existing applications which might depend on minor semantic changes. Posix
signal functions and analogues in the BSD model are listed in Table 1.
   Posix has introduced a new function, sigpending, which identifies the
signals currently blocked from delivery and pending for the calling
process.
   All signal functions may operate on one or more signals by using a set
of signals defined by the type sigsett. These signal sets have historically
been implemented as a simple integral bit mask, manipulated by a single
macro, sigmask. To support potentially more complex implementations,
Posix.1 introduced a group of functions to manipulate signal sets:
sigemptyset, sigfillset, sigaddset, sigdelset, and sigismember.
   An application must initialize any signal set with sigemptyset or
sigfillset to allow flexibility in the definition of sigsett, and
compatibility with signals not defined by Posix.1. If an implementation
defines additional signals, they may not be present in a signal set that
was initiated by sigfillset.
   For example, your application may attempt to ignore all known signals by
using code similar to the following fragment:
   for (i = 1; i < NSIG; i++)
   signal(i, SIGIGN);
   Unfortunately, this code is not Posix.1-compliant for two reasons.
First, the constant NSIG is not part of the standard. If it is necessary to
operate on all Posix.1 signals at once, the sigfillset function should be
used. Second, the signal function is not required by the Posix.1 standard.
The signal function is defined by the C standard, but it may not be built
on a reliable mechanism on some implementations.
   If you wish to avoid using the more complex sigaction interface, there
is a solution: provide your own signal interface based on sigaction. A
suitable implementation is provided in Listing 1, which, strictly speaking,
should be named something other than signal. The code uses a standard C
function prototype.
   Regarding NSIG: a portable application cannot make assumptions about the
underlying implementation of sigsett. One method for achieving the same
utility in a Posix.1 application is to block all signals from delivery. The
function sigprocmask sets, modifies, and accesses the set of signals that
is currently blocked by the calling process.
   Signal blocking is another feature of the BSD model that was not present
in early versions of System V. A block prevents a signal from being
delivered, but if the signal is later unblocked, it will be delivered. In
other words, the occurrence of a blocked signal is "remembered," and an
ignored signal is forgotten.
   While the signal set type and support routines provide more flexibility,
they complicate the process of porting code based on the BSD interfaces.
The small program in Listing 2 executes two processes that catch and send
signals to each other using the Posix and historical BSD interfaces.
   On lines 8, 27 and 51 of Listing 2, the macro POSIXSOURCE is used to
distinguish between these two interfaces. This macro is used by the Posix.1
standard to control name space pollution: it must be defined by
Posix-conforming applications before the inclusion of Posix header files.
When this macro is defined, the implementation must ensure that only the
interfaces defined by Posix.1 and standard C are visible to an application
program.
   If the program in Listing 2 was intended to be used only in Posix.1
environments, to ensure that the proper name space is used, you would
include the following macro definition at the very beginning of
the program:
   #ifndef POSIXSOURCE
   #define POSIXSOURCE
   #endif
The macro is conditionally defined because an implementation's C compiler
may predefine it as a courtesy. There is no specification in Posix.1 of the
value of this constant.
   Note the initialization of the signal set using the function sigemptyset
on line 30 of Listing 2, and its use with sigaction and sigsuspend on lines
40 and 52, respectively. Also note the use of the type pidt as the return
value from the functions fork and getppid. In the BSD implementation on
lines 11-13, the type of the signal catcher's return value has changed from
void to int. The structure and function sigvec will be substituted for
sigaction, and the type int substituted for pidt.

Sessions and Job Control
While Posix.1 has formalized the notion of sessions, this concept was based
largely on the job control model introduced by BSD: a user interacts with a
command shell or other "job control-aware" application during a terminal
session, which may create and transfer control to different jobs, or
process groups. In earlier versions of System V, each session corresponded
to a single process group.
   There is only one active, or foreground, process group at any one time
in each session. If there is a terminal device associated with a
session-the controlling terminal-the foreground process group has complete
access to the terminal and receives signals from the terminal interface
generated by user input, such as interrupt and suspend.
   Posix.1 was forced to resolve the name conflict between the System V and
BSD definition of the function setpgrp. Semantics similar to the former and
latter are provided by the Posix functions setsid and setpgid,
respectively. The setsid function creates a new session. The calling
process has no controlling terminal and becomes the leader of this new
session and a new process group. Within its current session, the setpgid
function allows a process to join another process group or create its
own-this Posix function has more restrictions than the BSD implementation
of setpgrp.
   Because most applications do not need to be aware of job-control signals
and operations, the Posix.1 committee decided to make provision of this
functionality optional. Unless your application requires job control, it
should be prepared for a system that doesn't support it. On such a system,
the functions setpgid, tcgetpgrp, and tcsetpgrp may fail with the global
error indicator errno, set to ENOSYS. In addition, sending or attempting to
catch or block one of the following signals will return an error: SIGCHLD,
SIGCONT, SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU.
   If your application is a "job-control" shell, you should read the
detailed advice contained in the definition of the term in the rationale of
the standard.
   Remote terminal connections or file transfer programs need to be
concerned with sessions. These applications want an asynchronous device to
become their controlling terminal, so that the hang-up signal will be
received when the line is dropped. Unfortunately, Posix.1 did not
standardize a mechanism for processes to gain a new controlling terminal.
   For most processes this is not a problem because they simply inherit
their controlling terminal from their parent. The first device opened by a
new session leader, typically the getty/login process, traditionally became
the controlling terminal for the process. While Posix.1 "blessed" this
behavior, it does not require it-user login was deemed an administrative
function outside the scope of this standard.
   As mentioned earlier, a session may lack a controlling terminal; this is
desirable for programs, such as daemons, that operate in the background and
should not be affected by user actions at terminals. The setsid function is
a simple interface to use for this capability. Daemons must still
frequently send messages, especially errors, to some terminal device, such
as the system console, however.
   Although the Posix.1 committee was reluctant to specify a mechanism to
acquire a new controlling terminal, the standard provides a facility for
daemons that doesn't compromise the application's detachment from the
control of a terminal. A new flag, ONOCTTY, that prevents the device being
opened from becoming the calling process' controlling terminal, has been
defined for the open function. The following code segment demonstrates the
relevant steps to set up a Posix.1 daemon's error output:
   (void) setsid();
   fd = open("/dev/console",
    ORDWR ONOCTTY);
   Because a Posix system is not required to provide a special file name
"/dev/console/", this is not strictly conforming code.

Terminal I/O
The general-purpose ioctl function has been replaced by a number of
context-specific services (see Table 2). System V did not support job
control before Posix.1 was incorporated in Release 4. The ioctl arguments
that correspond to the job control-related functions, tcgetpgrp and
tcsetpgrp, are taken from BSD.
   The termios data structure is manipulated by the tcgetattr and tcsetattr
routines. The name has been changed from the System V structure, termio, to
protect innocent applications on implementations that provide a
backward-compatible terminal I/O interface.
   Listing 3 shows an application that supports rudimentary, line-oriented,
user input, and invokes the terminal I/O interface to ensure that
characters are "erased" when the keyboard erase character is received. To
demonstrate the relationships in Table 2, the Posix.1 interfaces are
invoked using macros that call ioctl, which could be used in an older,
non-compliant System V environment.
   In addition to the ioctl replacement routines, another set of routines
has been created to manipulate the baud rate stored in the termios
structure. The routines-cfgetispeed, cfgetospeed, cfsetispeed, and
cfsetospeed-get and set the input and output baud rates, respectively.
Terminal baud rates are represented using an unsigned integral type,
speedt, defined in <termios.h>. Listing 4 demonstrates how you might set
the line speed to 2400 baud in a Posix.1 and an old System V application.
You must set both the input and output speeds, because an implementation
may support split rates under Posix.1.
   The use of the function tcgetattr is important to establish the initial
settings of the termios structure. This is the only portable way to modify
the terminal settings, because an implementation may include additional
fields in the termios structure and may require certain values in those
fields. Systems compatible with older System V applications may provide a
field that determines which line discipline will be enforced. Portable
Posix.1 applications should not attempt to build termios structures from
scratch.

ALIGNING COLUMNS, AGING PARAGRAPHS, AND NETWORK TIME PROTOCOL

By:
Dr. Rebecca Thomas

Tom Barron provides a filter handy for aligning columnar data separated by
spaces and tabs. Larry Ruane contributes a program that ages, and
eventually expires, paragraph-oriented items in a text file, which
administrators might find useful for automatically eliminating entries from
the message-of-the-day file. Ed Vielmetti introduces NTP, or network time
protocol, in response to my February 1992 request for time-service
information. Enjoy.

Ducks in a Row
Dear Dr. Thomas:
My submission aligns text into columns, and consists of two nawk programs
with a shell wrapper to invoke them Listing 1A. The first instance of nawk
determines the maximum width of each input field and the second uses that
information to align the fields. String data is left-justified and numeric
fields are right-justified within the field width. User-specified
intercolumn spacing can be used to override the default value of two
spaces. The nawk programs assume that input fields are separated by blanks
and/or tabs.
Tom Barron
Nashville, Tenn.

Part A of Listing 1 provides the align program, Part B some sample input,
and Part C the output produced by align. In this case, you see one
shortcoming: the last "logical" field titled "Mounted on" is treated as two
separate fields-thus the minus sign placeholders at the ends of the
remaining lines.
   I find align especially useful when I have tabulated data and want to
convert the tabs to spaces. Generally, if you convert each tab character to
some number of spaces, even if it's eight, the columnar alignment is thrown
off. However, align does a nice job of lining up the result.
   Explanation of align operation. Line 6 is the dormant debugging
directive documented in my April 1992 column. Line 7 defines the default
intercolumn spacing to be two spaces, and Line 8 defines the correct usage
message for invoking align.
   Lines 10-22 process command-line arguments. The "case" construct on
lines 10-15 checks the argument count. If zero, nothing needs to be done.
If one, line 12 assigns the supplied argument to the Spacing variable. More
than one argument is a usage error, so line 13 reports the transgression
and the script terminates. Lines 17-22 check to make sure that the value
assigned to the Spacing variable is numeric. If not, line 21 issues the
correct usage message and terminates the script.
   Line 25 sets a trap to erase the temporary files whenever the script
exits normally or is interrupted by a signal. The first nawk program (lines
27-47) scans its standard input, writes a copy to a temporary file for
subsequent processing, and creates another temporary file containing the
maximum width of each field found in the input. The second nawk program
(lines 49-89) uses the field-width data to process the temporary file
containing a copy of the standard input.
   Line 29 splits each input line into array word on field separator blank,
which corresponds to space or tab characters. If line 30 detects that the
field count for the input line is greater than the current maximum, line 31
updates maxcount with the new value. Line 33 prints the input line to
standard output, which is redirected to the align$$out temporary file by
line 47. Using $$-the process-id of the shell running the align
script-makes the temporary file name unique.
   Lines 35-39 determine the maximum width of each input field: line 35
scans each input field; if line 36 detects that the current field width is
greater than the maximum width seen so far, the maximum width value is
updated by line 37. The END-pattern action (lines 41-46) creates the width
file: line 42 generates the unique name of the temporary width file (procid
contains the process-id of the shell running the program, which was passed
to nawk on its invocation line, line 47); line 43 scans each field; line 44
writes the maximum width of the corresponding field to the width file; and
finally, line 46 writes a newline.
   The BEGIN-pattern action of the second nawk program (lines 50-54) reads
the width file and places the values into the width array. The main portion
of the program (lines 55-89) reads the input data stored in the temporary
file using input redirection specified on line 89. Line 56 splits each
field of an input line into a word array. Then the "for" loop encompassing
lines 57-87 scans each field, assuming up to maxcount fields.
   Lines 58-86 specify a series of if-else clauses to determine the type of
data in the input field, which is handled accordingly:
-- If the field begins with zero (0), it is treated as the number zero, so
a field containing 0% isn't treated as a string.
-- Else, if the field is empty, insert a placeholder (a minus sign is
used).
-- Else, if the field evaluates numerically to zero value, treat it as a
string. With nawk, zero added to a string gives zero.
-- Else, treat it as a number.

Lines 58-65 handle a special numerical case: If line 58 determines that the
first character is a zero, then lines 59-60 print spaces to right-justify
the field contents within the maximum field width; line 62 outputs the
field value; and lines 63-65 add the intercolumn spacing.
   Lines 66-71 handle the empty field case: if line 66 determines that the
field is empty, then line 67 prints a minus sign (-) placeholder, and lines
68-71 add intercolumn spacing.
   Lines 72-77 handle the case in which the field contains a string value:
if line 72 determines that zero added to the field value is zero, then the
field was a string; if so, line 73 outputs the string and lines 74-77
output spaces to left-justify the string within the maximum field width.
   Lines 78-85 handle the default case, in which the field contains a
number. If so, lines 79-81 output spaces to right-justify the number; line
82 outputs the numerical value; and lines 83-85 add the intercolumn
spacing. Finally, line 88 writes the newline end-of-line terminator.
   Portability Note. For some versions of nawk, the value of a variable
defined on its invocation command line isn't accessible within the
BEGIN-pattern action. For such a case use the approach shown in Listing
1D.

Aging Items
Dear Dr. Thomas:
Most UNIX systems display the file /etc/motd at the start of each log-in
session. This "message-of-the-day" file typically contains announcements of
general interest to the users of that system. A common problem with
/etc/motd is that the notices become obsolete. Users become annoyed-or
worse, confused-when they see an announcement on Monday that the machine
will be rebooted on Sunday, the previous day. Furthermore, users may
eventually ignore all messages if some become dated. System administrators
bear the burden of removing items from /etc/motd at the right time.
   The following filter Listing 2A uses either the new or old version of
awk to "age" items in a text file. An "item" is zero or more blank lines,
followed by one or more non-blank lines, optionally followed by a line of
the form expire integer. Here, integer is a "time-to-live" count for the
associated item.
   If the expire line exists, and the time-to-live count is zero, the item
is discarded and not written to the standard output. If the time-to-live
count is not zero, the script writes out the item and then the expire line,
where the time-to-live count has been reduced by one. An item with no
expire line is written out unconditionally because it never expires.
   We use cron to invoke our filter to age items in /etc/motd every morning
at 1:30 a.m. see Listing 2B. Our entry changes the directory containing the
message-of-the-day file, then runs age and stores the result in a new file,
nmotd. Then we rename that file to motd so it will be displayed when a user
logs in. We use the && shell connective so the rename is only done if the
age program exits successfully.
   Explanation of age operation. The first "if" clause (lines 6-14) detects
a legal expire line. If the time remaining in the second field ($2) is
non-zero, each line in this item is printed by lines 8-9, followed by
another expire line with a reduced time-to-live count ($2 - 1).
   The program takes advantage of awk's built-in NR, for record number,
variable, which is initially zero and is automatically incremented before
each line is read. By resetting this variable at appropriate times, NR
actually holds the line number of the current item, rather than the line
count for the entire input file.
   The second "if" clause (lines 15-19) detects the first line of a new
item when the previous item did not end with an expire line. The previous
item is written out by lines 16-17. Line 18 resets NR to one (1) ready for
the next line, if any, for the item, and line 20 stores the current input
line in the current item array, item.
   If the last item in the file doesn't have an expire line, the
END-pattern action on lines 23-26 prints the item.
Lawrence M. Ruane
Naperville, Ill.

Listing 2C shows a sample section from the /etc/profile script file that
displays the message-of-the-day file for accounts that use the Bourne or
Korn shell as their log-in shell. I replaced the cat command, normally used
to display /etc/motd, with an egrep command invoked to display anything
except the expire-directive lines. The regular expression pattern is
matched by all lines that begin with the string "expire" followed by one or
more space or tab characters, which are in the "empty" square brackets,
followed by one or more decimal integers. The -v option directs egrep to
display every line that doesn't match its pattern argument.

Introducing NTP
Dear Dr. Thomas:
In response to your request for information on alternative time services,
here is some information on NTP, which is used to provide a distributed
time service for the Internet. A number of systems around the Net have
directly attached radio clocks, and these servers use NTP to send out the
time to campus or network-wide time servers that in turn distribute the
time to individual user workstations.
   You can get online information about NTP via anonymous FTP from the
Internet host louie.udel.edu (128.175.1.3). Look in the tree starting with
the /pub/ntp directory. The file /pub/ntp/doc/clock.txt contains an amazing
amount of information on time-code receivers, NTP time servers, and other
details. The protocol itself is documented in the Request for Comments
(RFC) publication number 1129, titled "Internet Time Synchronization: the
Network Time Protocol," and available as a compressed Postscript file,
/pub/ntp/doc/rfc1129.ps.Z.
   If your system or local-area network has a direct connection to the
Internet, you can use the "ntp" software found in the /pub/ntp/ntp.3.4
directory or the "xntp" software found in the /pub/ntp/xntp directory.
Either package will get you in sync once you have located a nearby server
that can provide you with the time. If you're not directly connected to the
Internet, it's still possible to use this software to keep good clocks. One
way is to build or buy your own radio receiver. Another is to use a time
service such as the NIST ACTS dial-up service described in the February
1992 issue. The clock.txt file noted above has these details.
   A mailing list, ntp@trantor.umd.edu (to get on the list send requests to
ntp-request@trantor.umd.edu) covers NTP, and comp.protocols.time.ntp, a
Usenet newsgroup, is connected to the mailing list by a gateway.
   NTP is designed to distribute time information in a large, diverse
internetworked system operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave. It
uses a returnable-time architecture in which a distributed subnetwork of
time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave
configuration synchronizes the subnet's local clocks to national time
standards via wire or radio. The servers can also redistribute time
information within a network using local routing algorithms and time
daemons.
   The architectures, algorithms, and protocols that have evolved to NTP
over several years of implementation and refinement are also described in
the RFC. The synchronization subnet has been in regular operation on the
Internet for the last several years. It is described along with performance
data that shows that time-keeping accuracy throughout most portions of the
Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds,
even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers, or
networks.

DATA TYPES, FILE TYPES, CONNECT WITH THE DOT

By:
Ray Swartz

To lead off this month, Bob Neuberger asks how to determine the data type
of shell variables. Actually, shell variables don't have data types, but I
review arithmetic operations using the various shells. William Pinard wants
to know if the C shell has an equivalent for the Bourne and Korn shells'
"dot" command. I explain the source command. Finally, Pat Concannon asks
how to add new file types to the file command, and I provide an example of
how to do so.

What's Your Type
Question: Is there a way to determine the data type of a shell variable?
Bob Neuberger
Santa Clara, Calif.

Answer: The quick answer is that shell variables only store characters and
that no numeric variables are provided by either the Bourne, C, or Korn
shells. This appears to contradict the fact that both the Korn and C shells
supply operators for performing arithmetic manipulations on variables, but
the arithmetic operators only work on shell variables that hold numeric
characters, that is, digits zero to nine.
   The Bourne shell has no built-in numeric operators and relies completely
on the expr command. The C and Korn shells offer special built-in
arithmetic commands, but they only work on integers.
   The Bourne shell only handles character data, and no facilities are
provided to deal with numeric data. If you want to add, subtract, multiply,
divide, or take a modulo, you can use expr. In fact, a common Bourne shell
programming command is a='expr $a + 1', which executes the expr command to
add one to the current value stored in a. The shell then assigns expr's
output into a. The expr command fails if one of the arguments in an
arithmetic statement is non-numeric, which includes non-integer values.
   The C shell takes a different approach by providing two different
variable assignment operators: set and @. The set command is used to assign
values to character variables, and @ is used to assign the result of both
arithmetic and bitwise operations to a variable.
   The operators that can be used with @ are addition (+), subtraction (-),
multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%), right shift (>>), left shift
(<<), one's complement (), bitwise or (), bitwise exclusive or (), bitwise
and (&), increment (++), and decrement (--). Personally, I've never needed
to use bitwise operators inside a shell script, but the C shell makes them
available. According to the C Shell Field Guide, by Gail and Paul Anderson
(Prentice-Hall, 1986), the number of bits used to represent a shell
variable is usually the word size of the underlying computer (16 or 32
bits).
   Even though the C shell has numeric operators, the results are stored as
character digits. Thus, rotating a value to the left 10 times won't change
the number of bits used, but will require more characters to represent the
value. For example, if set a = 3478 and @ b = ( $a << 10 ), then b holds
3561472. Incidentally, you have to put the expression $a << 10 inside
parentheses to avoid confusion, because << is also a shell redirection
metacharacter.
   To demonstrate how these operators work, I've written the mkbits C shell
script, which takes a number as an argument and then creates the
corresponding bit pattern used to represent that value. The mkbits script
is shown in Listing 1A. Listing 1B shows mkbits in action.
   Current versions of the Korn shell (after June 3, 1986) offer the same
arithmetic and bitwise operators as the C shell. Like the C shell, the Korn
shell has a separate command for assigning the result of an arithmetic or
bitwise operation to variables. The Korn shell uses let or double
parentheses. Thus, let a=a+3 adds three to the current value of a. This can
also be written ((a=a+3)). Note that a $ is not required in front of
variable names in let or ((..)) statements. The Korn shell equivalent to
the mkbits script is shown in Listing 1C.
   The Korn shell has an additional numeric feature, the typeset command,
which lets you assign attributes to your variables. Using typeset you can
create integer variables with the command typeset -i variable-name. Trying
to assign a non-integer to such a variable will result in an error. This is
the only instance where a shell variable has a data type.

Going to the Source
Question: I often need to execute one of our script files that sets a
number of environment variables. Under the Bourne and Korn shells, I can
use the command ../filename, which executes the file's commands as part of
the current process. This is required to make the environment variable
definitions accessible.
Is there a C shell equivalent to the Bourne and Korn shell's dot command?
Attempting this under the C shell gives a "Permission Denied" error.
William Pinard
Ann Arbor, Mich.

Answer: The C shell was designed to have built-in commands that are
completely incompatible with those of the Bourne shell, which greatly
reduces the problems associated with having both Bourne and C shell scripts
on the same system. In most cases, the C shell fails if it executes a
Bourne shell script. The same is true if a C shell script is run by the
Bourne shell.
   This is the reason why the dot command doesn't work in the C shell. The
C shell uses the source command instead. Thus, instead of ../filename, use
source ./filename.
   A related point is why you get the "Permission denied" error message
when the C shell doesn't recognize the dot command. In this case, the C
shell sees the dot as the relative path name of the command you want to
run. Because dot is a legal file name, the C shell tries to execute your
current directory, but fails with the "Permission denied" message.
   Incidentally, because of the Bourne/C shell incompatibilities, you can't
source a file that contains Bourne shell export commands. The C shell
doesn't use the export command and if it sees it, an error will result. To
set up environmental variables in the C shell, use the setenv command. The
syntax is setenv environment-variable value. Note that no equal sign is
used in the setenv command. As an example of usage, the command setenv TERM
ansi sets the TERM environment variable to ansi.

Marking Your Territory
Question: As part of an internal application, we've created a number of
custom data files. I'd like to make the file command aware of them. Is
there a way to do that?
Pat Concannon
Chicago, Ill.

Answer: The file command examines the first 512 bytes of a file and tries
to identify what kind of file it is. It correctly handles directories,
executable files, shell scripts, and ASCII files. The key to it is the
/etc/magic file.
   The /etc/magic file has four tab-separated fields. The first field is an
integer offset into the file where you want the command to examine
something.
   Field two is what you want file to examine. Your choices are byte,
short, long, and string. The types byte, short, and long may be followed by
an & and a mask value that is applied before the actual file comparison is
made.
   Field three is the value to use in identifying the file type. This can
be a number (octal values are preceded by 0 and hex values by 0x) or a
string (C escape sequences allowed), which can be preceded by an optional
test operator. The allowed test operators are =, <, and >. The = operator
is the default.
   Field four is the message to print if the described test is valid. In
most cases, it is a string that describes what kind of file has been found.
However, you can use a printf-style format string and the value found in
the file will be substituted for any format specifiers (%d, %o, %x, %c, %s,
etc.) in the format string.
   If you need to perform several tests on a file to identify its type
exactly, you can add more tests by placing a > as the first character on a
line. This tells file to continue testing.
   Listing 2A shows a line I added to my /etc/magic file that identifies
files with RAY as the first three characters. Such files are identified as
"Ray's files." Listing 2B demonstrates that test.
   If file can't identify the type of file based on the tests in
/etc/magic, it uses an internal set of heuristics to guess the "language"
of the file. The guesses are based on the character frequencies and if the
file is executable. These guesses are often wrong.

Going to the Dump
In response to the questions about hot keys, Patrick Combet, of Noisy Le
Grand Cedex, France, suggests a method for reading keys off the keyboard
without using C code. His solution is to use dd to read the keyboard after
setting the terminal to raw mode with stty. His approach is shown in
Listing 3. He notes in his letter that the redirection of dd's standard
error is to suppress dd's "blocks in, blocks out" message.

LISTING 1: The C shell provides several arithmetic and bitwise operators
that can be used in shell scripts.
A. The mkbits script converts numbers into their bit patterns:
1  #! /bin/csh
2  if ( $#argv ) then # any arguments?
3  set nbr = $argv1
4  else
5  echo "Usage: $0 Number"
6  exit 1
7  endif
8  set bitpattern # initialize pattern to empty
9  set cntr = 1 # initalize counter
10 while ( $cntr != 0 ) # at end of bits?
11 @ result = ($nbr & $cntr) # test single bit
12 @ cntr = ($cntr << 1) # increment tester
13 if ( $result ) then # bit set?
14 set bitpattern = 1$bitpattern # yes
15 else
16 set bitpattern = 0$bitpattern # no
17 endif
18 end
19 echo $bitpattern
20 exit 0

B. The mkbits script in action:
% mkbits 3478
00000000000000000000110110010110
% mkbits 3561472
00000000001101100101100000000000
%

C. The Korn shell version of mkbits:
1  case $# in
2  1) b=$1 ;;
3  *) echo "Usage: $0 Number"
4  exit 1 ;;
5  esac
6  a=1 # initalize counter
7  while $a != 0 # at end of bits?
8  do
9  ((c=b&a)) # test single bit
10 ((a=a<<1)) # increment tester
11 if $c -ne 0 ; then # bit set?
12 bitpattern=1$bitpattern # yes
13 else
14 bitpattern=0$bitpattern # no
15 fi
16 done
17 echo $bitpattern
18 exit 0

LISTING 2: You can identify files using the file command and its data
file, /etc/magic.
A. An entry that, when added to /etc/magic,causes the file command to
recognize files beginning with the string "RAY" as "Ray's files":
0 string RAY Ray's file

B. The file command finds Ray's file:
$ cat file.test
RAY
$ file file.test
file.test Ray's file
$

LISTING 3: Reading the keyboard without waiting for return using dd.
stty raw
x='dd bs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null'
stty -raw

x now set to single character entered

HOW TO BUILD X TERMINALS AND COOPERATION

LSI Logic Corp. has come out with a dual-purpose board called the Racer X
Evaluation Board, targeting original equipment manufacturers interested in
X terminal manufacturing. The board, which comes with a MIPS-based
microprocessor manufactured by LSI, can be used in one of two ways: If you
want to develop your own X server software, you can use the Racer X as a
target system onto which you can download and debug software; if you want
to build a complete X terminal around the board, you can order it with AGE
Logic's Xoftware M300L X server.
   As well as two purposes, the Racer X board comes in two versions-one for
monochrome X terminal development and one for eight-bit color X terminal
development. The board includes four megabytes of dynamic RAM (DRAM)
expandable to eight megabytes, and the color version has one megabyte of
video RAM. The board is 7 by 9 1/4 inches, and supports 25-, 33-, and
40-MHz operations. It includes support for the requisite hardware features:
keyboard, mouse, and Ethernet ports. Price for the 25-MHz Racer X
evaluation board with eight-bit color is $3,950, or $2,950 for monochrome;
AGE's X server software is sold separately.

HOW ABOUT SOME COOPERATION HERE

The long-awaited version of NCR Corp.'s Cooperation for UNIX arrives this
summer to bring UNIX-based server software to Intel Corp. PCs-Cooperation
for OS/2 is already available. The underlying concept, pioneered by AT&T's
Rhapsody, is to have a multitasking operating system like UNIX on the
server and a single-tasking operating system like DOS on the desktop.
Cooperation is actually a collection of 50 modules in four categories that
work together to bring information from the network to the desktop. Using
Cooperation's modules, developers can set up users' desktops to take
advantage of the company's particular environment.
   The modules can be information access, user, application, and network
services. Information access services include terminal emulation, transfer
protocols, and multiple database access. The second category, user
services, encompasses the graphical desktop, including the clock,
electronic mail, file manager, waste basket, and printer icons. At this
level you can also link "objects" so that one file can be linked to
another; for example, a spreadsheet can be linked to a word processing
file, so that the document is automatically updated when the spreadsheet is
changed. Cooperation provides "application bridges" to more than 30 DOS and
Windows applications so you can import and export data.
   While the user services are linked on the desktop, the application
services help programmers link applications across the network. These
modules also handle security and logging information for the system
administrator. The fourth category, network services, handles the
connections between the NCR System 3000 servers and desktops using
Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager 2.0, as well as between the local-area
network (LAN) and IBM Corp. SNA-based systems. Network services also
include e-mail gateway facilities to a variety of proprietary systems via
Softswitch Inc.'s software gateways.
   Costs for 16-user systems range from $18,120 for Cooperation and $1,133
per user for a minimum configuration, to $44,710 for Cooperation and $2,794
per user. Prices depend on software options and do not include operating
system software for either the desktops or the servers.

BACKUP TO THE MAINFRAME

New Era's Harbor backup software is designed to let you use an MVS-based
IBM mainframe as an archive and server for networks that incorporates PCs
running DOS or OS/2 and UNIX workstations. The client computers can be
connected via 3270 emulation, TCP/IP, asynchronous protocols, or IBM's
advanced peer-to-peer communication protocol. Harbor lets you do overnight
backups, recovery, select which version of a document you want restored,
and check for non-standard files that may contain viruses.
   The software does incremental backups when activity is low, and offers
users the choice of which version to recover. The interface can be
character- or Microsoft Windows-based. The data is stored on the mainframe
in compressed mode, after which it can be migrated to less-expensive media.
Administrators can still use existing MVS data management and security
software features. Price ranges from $25,000 to $90,000 for the mainframe
component of the software, and from $90 to $260 per workstation, depending
on the number of workstations linked.

WHAT A PERFORMANCE

Emulex Corp.'s communications server, Performance 8000, provides connection
capabilities with full redundancy and fault tolerance for 32 to 128
devices. The Performance 8000 is available with "self-load" capabilities,
which enable the server to connect online without downloading software from
a host system. It also comes with a "network-load" capability, and supports
both TCP/IP and local-area transport (LAT).
   Emulex has equipped the server with RS422 and RS423 interfaces, so that
you put the server further from the serial device. The RS423 interface
links devices up to 400 feet from the server, and the RS422 interface
allows a distance of 1,000 feet. The P8000 unit with RS423 interface is
priced from $11,600 to $23,285 for network-loading servers, and from
$12,410 to $24,725 for self-loading servers. The P8000 with RS422 interface
is priced from $11,700 to $23,685 (network-loading), and from $12,510 to
$25,125 (self-loading).

NOW PLAYING AT YOUR LOCAL XYPLEX

Xyplex Inc. has introduced two networking products, multiprotocol local
routers and an Ethernet-to-X.25 gateway. The 3210 and 3710 multiprotocol
local routers handle both internet protocol (IP) and IPX traffic, but other
protocols can be simultaneously bridged as well. The 3210 local router is a
standalone device with two Ethernet connections priced at $3,695. The 3710
is a board that you can install in a Xyplex communications chassis, and is
priced at $2,995.
   The 6025 Ethernet-to X.25 gateway provides TCP/IP and LAT users with
access to X.25 wide area networks, and lets users of public and private
packet-switched data networks connect to resources on the Ethernet LAN. The
6025 includes a 3 1/2-inch floppy disk drive. Because the X.25 gateway
provides a local connection from a host with an X.25 interface to a
TCP/IP-LAT Ethernet LAN, it helps network managers can protect their
investment in older technology, according to Xyplex. The 6025 gateway is
priced at $4,995.

LEAVING PRINTS ON THE NETWORK

An alternative to buying a printer that links to an Ethernet network is to
buy an adapter that links your current printer to Ethernet. Microplex's
M201 TCP/IP printer adapter lets you link plotters, printers, or other
output devices to the network. You can attach one parallel and two serial
printers to the Microplex adapter, which incorporates a 16-bit
microprocessor and direct-memory access capability for better performance.
The parallel port transfers data at 50,000 characters per second, while the
serial ports operate at up to 38.4 kilobits per second and support Xon/Xoff
protocols. All three ports can output data simultaneously. One of the
serial interfaces also acts as a console port so you can run diagnostics.
   The adapter includes software to configure the adapter's IP address and
port parameters. Command-line utilities display printer status on any
connected terminal or workstation. An interface to System V and Berkeley
UNIX spooling permits multiple host access to printers and spooling. The
host software works with operating systems from AT&T, Digital Equipment
Corp., DataGeneral Corp., HP, IBM, SCO, and Sun. Price is $995.

MEET ME DOWN AT THE BAR CODE

Basis Inc. is working to simplify connecting UNIX systems to bar-code
scanning systems. Its BIS/System consists of a set of programming modules
that let users bypass special gateways that might have been necessary in
the past. According to Basis, you can transport scanned bar code
data-without intermediate devices-to networked databases where the
information can be manipulated, filed, and printed. The Basis software can
support up to 140 Intermec Corp. scanners or printing devices per host, and
can be used with SPARCstations, Tandem Corp. Integrity fault-tolerant
systems, and PCs running SCO UNIX.
   The modules can be used like building blocks. BIS/One is a C-based
application programming interface (API). BIS/Net is a networked version of
the BIS/One API. BIS/SNMP adds SNMP capability to manage the devices. The
fourth module, BIS/X, provides an X Windows interface for graphical
depiction of devices on the network. The software supports C-language SQL
bindings in Oracle Corp., Informix Software Inc., and Sybase Inc.
databases, among others. Initial license prices are based on largest class
of machine on the network. BIS/One prices range from $495 to $1,295 for the
initial license, and from $195 to $695 for each additional user. Prices for
BIS/Net range from $995 to $3,995, and from $295 to $995. Prices for
BIS/SNMP and BIS/X range from $250 to $995, and from $75 to 250.

JUST THE FAX

A new division of Samsung devoted to software has inaugurated its first
product, Replix, a UNIX fax application. It eliminates the need for a fax
machine, and uses your computer as a sending or receiving device. You can
fax documents directly from Postscript and ASCII documents, or e-mail.
According to Samsung, you can also send faxes to multiple recipients and
schedule faxes for later transmission. You can forward incoming faxes to
other users through e-mail or automatic printing.
   Replix lets you build "phone books" for personal or departmental use,
with easy selection of multiple recipients. The software also allows you to
query the system for the status of incoming and outgoing faxes. Running
under X Windows with the Motif interface, Replix can be integrated with
other X Windows-based applications. Replix runs on Sun, HP, IBM, PC, and
Samsung computers running UNIX, and can transmit faxes to ASCII terminals.
An Everex 24/96 D Class 2 fax modem is also required. Price starts at
$2,395 for two clients, unlimited servers, one modem, and unlimited
command-line clients. Additional support is available in separate
packages.

GETTING THE SALESQ MESSAGEQ

Following its BugQ and CustomerQ applications for handling software
problems and customer support, Quintus has developed two more workgroup
applications. SalesQ is for sales and contract tracking, while MessageQ
handles telephone messages. According to Quintus, SalesQ can automate sales
and lead tracking, direct mail campaigns, activity reporting and
forecasting, and customer contract management. You can get a system that is
already configured, or contract with Quintus for further customization. The
latter might include setting up rules specific to your business (for
example, no selling more product to a customer that hasn't paid invoices
consistently), setting up communication to customers via e-mail or fax, or
creating ad hoc report generation capabilities. Price ranges from $50,000
to $100,000, depending on customization and integration requirements.
   MessageQ handles telephone messages so that they can be sent by e-mail,
kept in a database, or faxed to off-site locations where employees might be
traveling. According to Quintus, it can be used as a primary or back-up
messaging system, or as a departmental system. Price ranges from $1,500 for
a basic system to $5,000.

HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO COST?

GE Aerospace has developed a version of its software price estimation
software, Price S, for PCs running UNIX. Originally available only on
mainframes, Price S is designed to give software developers realistic
schedule and cost estimates. It can also estimate the cost of developing,
integrating, and testing related software modules into a single system. To
calculate the projected cost of a software project, you only need seven
parameters, according to GE.
   These parameters could include be the size of the program (in bytes),
the number of lines of code, the percentage of new code to be written, or
the memory constraints of the hardware. The pricing software can also take
into account the percentage of the code that will be devoted to certain
tasks, such as real-time input or math calculations. Cost of Price S is
$17,000 per year for a single copy (site licenses are also available).

FILE THIS UNDER EZ

SJT Software has developed a file manager for PC UNIX systems using SCO and
Interactive UNIX SVR3. The EZ-File Manager is an interface designed to take
the place of the command line. You can launch an application simply by
putting the cursor next to it, and you can execute commands for particular
files by typing the command name next to the file name. The program keeps a
visual history of previously typed commands and directories, and lets you
copy, move, delete, chmod, and chown entire directory structures. For
programmers, it updates directories regularly, so that when the compile
process creates a new file, it appears on the EZ-File Manager interface.
Running on EGA/VGA screens, the software costs $198.

NOT MY FAULT TOLERANCE

1776 Inc. has developed fault-tolerant software for PC UNIX systems called
Multi-Host that lets one system act as a backup for the other. When a fault
is detected in the primary machine, the Multi-Host software automatically
switches activity over to the backup system. The two systems are linked
through an external SCSI bus.
   According to 1776, this "light fault tolerance" capability can bring
high-availability to lower-cost systems. A lower-cost option requires
switch-over to be handled by a human operator. Price of the Multi-Host
software ranges from $1,990 to $5,980, based on system and configuration.

SCANNING FOR SCANNERS
The scanner for your UNIX application isn't a commodity, yet-here's how
toavoid paying too much for the wrong one

By:
Mike Burgard


It's Dr. Eddie Prestridge's responsibility to make sure mass-produced items
like telephones and desks withstand the wear and tear they receive during
typical use. At Princeton Gamma-Tech Inc., an image enhancement firm,
Prestridge's clients use electron microscopes to analyze the materials in
these products. The problem is, some of their clients' older electron
microscopes can only generate hard-copy prints.
   Prestridge used video cameras to capture these prints for further
analysis, but they were slow and degraded image resolution. To solve the
problem, he purchased a scanner and attached it to a UNIX workstation.
Scanning the hard-copy prints lets Princeton Gamma-Tech input higher
resolution images and conduct better analysis using its own
image-enhancement equipment. Says Prestridge, "Video can only produce 512
pixels per line, while our scanner supports 4,000 pixels per line."
Princeton Gamma-Tech's specialized application is just one of many
applications of UNIX-based scanners. The complexity of the company's work
is indicative of what considerations go into the purchase of a scanner.
Unlike commodity items such as printers, scanners are generally purchased
for specific tasks.
   Scanner prices start at about $2,000 for a simple grayscale UNIX desktop
scanner-these resemble their PC-based siblings, and are about the same size
as a PC. Prices can climb to over $500,000 for a bundled high-end document
archive system. These larger free-standing machines look more like office
photocopiers, and usually have an integrated workstation and monitor for
editing and enhancing images.
   The key elements of scanners are speed, resolution, and compatibility.
Scanning technology has not advanced enough that a single system can meet
all these requirements, so compromise is inevitable. High-speed scanners
might scan as many as 25,000 documents in an eight-hour day.
High-resolution scanners can give you images as detailed as 2,400 dots per
inch (dpi), but at substantially lower speeds. In thecases in which users
insisted on the highest resolution at the highest speed, they paid dearly
for it.
   In most cases, once you've decided whether your application demands
speed or resolution, you must next consider software and compatibility. Do
you need a scanner with optical character recognition (OCR) software? Or do
you just need to access scanned images, such as invoices and other forms,
without modifying them?
   Whatever the task, no one wants to invest in an entirely new hardware
system to accommodate a scanner. Compatibility concerns include how the
scanner connects to your computer, what type of software is provided, and
how well it works with your existing system.
   All scanners, regardless of style or size, use a similar technology.
Think of a scanner as a high-powered copier with a direct interface to your
computer's hard disk. A beam of light passes over a document and captures
the image, the scanner then stores the image and tunes the results.
Grayscale scanners store each pixel as various shades of dark and light
bits. Color scanners separate the three primary colors into various shades
of each color. Resolution is affected by many factors, but is primarily
tied to the speed at which the light passes over the document. More bits
captured by the light mean a better quality image, but often at a slower
speed.
   Users of UNIX-based scanners usually fall into one of three application
groups. First, there are the traditional prepress and graphic arts
professionals who use systems designed to combine typeset text and scanned
images on a single page of a magazine, catalog, or brochure.
   The second group is users of large document archival systems, in which
thousands of documents, varying in size, content, and quality, may be
archived in a single day. At the U.S. Library of Congress, for example,
government workers input 2,500 to 5,000 documents a day. Scanners that
allow such high-volume input usually only support 60 to 200 dpi
resolution.
   Finally, people like Prestridge, and other scientists and engineers, are
in the group most likely to use desktop scanners for image-enhancement
applications. These people scan maps, drawings, and photographs and enhance
the images pixel by pixel to meet a specific need.

Can It do the Job?
Resolution and speed sit opposite each other on a seesaw: when one goes up,
the other comes down. Ed Ball is in charge of the prepress operations at
commercial printer Pearl Pressman Inc. He needs the quality of his scans to
match the quality of the finished printed pieces as closely as possible.
Commercial printing presses print at higher resolutions than computer
printers do, so if you input a photo with a low-resolution scanner, the
press cannot raise the resolution of the photograph. As a result, if the
scanner can't produce at least 1,000-dpi scans, the quality of what comes
out of the press suffers. Ball already owned a UNIX page layout system
capable of 2,400-dpi output, so he chose Du Pont Inc.'s expensive Imagitex
scanner to get the fastest speed possible with high resolution. But he paid
a price in excess of six figures to balance the seesaw as best he could.
   Dave Godman of General Dynamics Corp.'s electronics division, chose the
more typical path-high resolution at slower speed. Godman's group enhances
images for the U.S. Department of Defense, scanning maps provided by
military organizations including the Defense Mapping Agency. Using the maps
as background, Godman superimposes test-flight routes. The map is then
given to pilots for use on test flights.
   In order to create much more detailed maps, Godman needed a
high-resolution scanner that connected to his Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations. Sharp Corp.'s JX-600 gave him 600-dpi resolution at a
relatively low cost, but he had to compromise on speed, and gets only about
10 scans a day.
   Another user responsible for a state government contract needed exactly
the opposite trade-off between speed and resolution. Ken Sjogren, director
of Image System Products for Grumman Information Conversion, was bidding on
a contract that involved archiving years of paper-based tax records.
Sjogren used Eastman Kodak Co.'s 900 scanner-which is designed to work with
document-archival systems and scan up to 25,000 pages a day-in a
pre-contract demonstration. Sjogren believes the machine's speed swung the
state's decision in Grumman's favor.
   An issue is how to get documents into an archival system. According to
users, an automatic paper feeder is the best solution, but you may need to
look for one that can handle odd-size sheets. Users report that automatic
feeders work fine with 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper, but can jam up with odd-size
documents.

Working Together
Scanners are not like a typical peripheral that you can just plug in and
have work with your system. Compatibility, particularly in the area of
hardware connections and system integration, drives many a decision.
   As a photo retoucher for McMaster Carr Supply Inc., Johanna Stevens
could justify purchasing a scanner only if it worked with the Xyvision Inc.
page layout system she was using. She works with the pictures that go into
the catalog of parts and supplies McMaster sends to customers across the
country. There are thousands of pictures in every catalog, and because
every new or altered product has to have a new image placed in the computer
system, Stevens frequently stores more than 30,000 images.
   Before she bought a scanner, Stevens would get a photograph, send it to
a service bureau that stored it on a computer disk, wait up to three days
for its return, and then finally work on touching up the photo. Buying one
of Du Pont's scanners allows her to do all scanning in-house. It now takes
only an hour to restore an image, instead of days. Even this significant
time savings would have been offset by hardware costs had the scanner been
incompatible with the Xyvision system, however.
   The physical interface can be a compatibility sticking point for some.
Princeton Gamma-Tech's Prestridge found that most scanners don't use a SCSI
interface. A SCSI connection was a critical factor because Princeton
Gamma-Tech resells image-enhancement hardware with SCSI as the primary
interface, and the company could not risk compatibility problems.
   To avoid this, look closely at the interface you use and your scanner
will need. Some scanners, such as Du Pont's, attach directly to your
Ethernet network. And still others use the IEEE-sanctioned general-purpose
interface bus; several board vendors offer IEEE-488 expansion boards for
both VMEbus- and SBus-based workstations. Both Sharp and Mitsubishi Corp.
scanners use this interface, but have recently added SCSI support as well.

Integrating Your Software
The software interface is as important as the hardware interface. Most
people don't want to write both software interfaces for users and device
drivers for scanners. Users were happier working on the latter than the
former. In-house programming shops and system integrators tend to customize
their own interface, regardless of what is provided by the vendor.
   However, if your application involves document archival, software
compatibility tends to be of lesser importance because you're more likely
to need an integrated system that already has built-in scanners,
workstations, storage capability, and software.
   On the other hand, if you intend to scan and manipulate text, you need
to research whether the scanner you want features OCR software. Some
high-resolution systems incorporate OCR capabilities directly. Other
vendors sell an optional OCR software package, while still others leave it
up to third-party vendors. UNIX machines tend to be used more for
pixel-by-pixel image enhancement rather than text in OCR applications.
Remember that document archival often involves scanning paper with various
typefaces, intermixed images, and handwriting samples of questionable
quality. According to users, these challenges are beyond even the best OCR
software.
   Finally, regarding software, a typical eight-inch-square, eight-bit
color image scanned at 600 dpi takes about 23 megabytes of disk space,
which brings up data compression issues when you need high resolution for a
lot of images. One user strongly suggests that buyers ask vendors about
image-compression software to reduce storage requirements. Barring
compression built into the scanner, you can also look for boards for your
workstations that support data compression.

Price Scanners
Because they're not a commodity, scanners are not nearly as homogeneous as
other hardware peripherals when it comes to price. You can pay anywhere
from $2,000 to more than $150,000 for an integrated high-resolution scanner
and edit station, and up to $500,000 for document archive systems-so price
becomes an issue, especially for system integrators. For example, Princeton
Gamma-Tech bought its scanner from Apunix Inc., partially because the price
fit in with what it wanted to be able to charge for its own
image-enhancement equipment. On the other hand, Pearl Pressman's Ed Ball
wanted quality output and compatibility, so there was less flexibility on
what he had to pay.
   Scanner purchases only vaguely resemble hard drive or network card
purchases. Different uses, and a technical stalemate between speed and
resolution, require that you think long and hard about the scanner's
intended use. Words of wisdom from users sadly advise that, unlike most
computer purchases, price should be one of the last considerations. Step
one is to look at your application and decide whether your primary
objective is speed or resolution. Step two is to research the interfaces in
both hardware and software.
   The day may come, as more peripheral functions are integrated into
workstations, that step three may not be price consideration. Until then,
if you application requires a certain kind of scanning, the price is not
yet negotiable.

RIVALS COMPETE FOR E-MAIL STANDARDS

Electronic mail is rapidly becoming a communications mainstay for many
businesses. While it was once used only within individual organizations,
e-mail is now used to communicate between organizations. And this includes
more than just polite notes from one friend to another-today, e-mail
versions of purchase orders, invoices, financial transfers, and other
business documents are replacing their paper equivalents.
   But e-mail faces a major problem: incompatible e-mail formats make it
hard to send messages across different networks. Two standards are
currently competing to resolve that difficulty. One is the simple mail
transport protocol (SMTP) style of mail currently used on most UNIX
networks in the United States. The other is the international-standard
X.400 mail, the preferred type of e-mail in Europe which is also used by
most U.S. commercial e-mail carriers, such as MCI Mail. If one of the two
can gain clear dominance, it will define the shape of e-mail to come.

E-mail Evolution
E-mail found its earliest business uses when large time-sharing mainframes
made it possible to put a terminal on each employee's desk. Replacing paper
notes or memos between employees with electronic versions was a logical
application of computerized office-automation systems, such as IBM Corp.'s
PROFS e-mail. Early e-mail systems had a significant drawback, however: a
paper memo could go to anyone, but e-mail could only be sent to employees
connected to the same computer. With the arrival of UNIX workstations, and
PCs using local-area network systems such as Novell Inc.'s Netware, e-mail
became even more familiar to many large organizations-although it remained
limited to users directly connected to the local network in many cases.
   Today, e-mail is frequently sent between organizations. UNIX e-mail was
an early success, largely thanks to the support provided by the Internet, a
research network that was funded by the U.S. Defense Department to link
universities and other defense contractors. But commercial e-mail providers
such as MCI and AT&T have also demonstrated that there's a demand among
other businesses for the ability to send messages from one organization to
another-so much demand that they can make a profit from it.
   Other, more specialized forms of e-mail have also found wide business
acceptance. The most well-known is probably electronic data interchange
(EDI), a special form of e-mail that consists of electronic versions of
purchase orders, financial transfers, and other business documents. An EDI
message is not simply the text of a purchase order in electronic form;
instead, it's actually a data file that contains information in such a
well-defined format that it can be generated by one company's computer,
sent electronically to another company, and processed by the recipient's
computers-completely without human intervention. That's far faster, more
efficient, and error-free than paper documents that must be printed out
from one company's computers, delivered, then typed back into another
company's machines.
   Still other kinds of existing e-mail-such as the voice e-mail available
on computers from Next Computer Inc.-point to a future in which e-mail
could carry voice, images, and other binary data between different
companies and different machines as easily as it carries text messages
today.

The Compatibility Question
For the most part, e-mail's widespread success has been limited to text
with messages that will be read by human beings. Human readers are
remarkably flexible when it comes to finding messages in text, no matter
how it's formatted or what extraneous information the e-mail may contain.
Human readers have relatively little difficulty deciding which part of an
e-mail message is the "real message," and which part is information on how
the message traveled from the sender to the receiver-the electronic
equivalent of a postmark.
   That kind of flexibility isn't available when a computer is supposed to
read and process non-text messages. Computers need a well-defined format to
identify where a digitized voice message begins and ends, or where the data
in an EDI message is to be found. Without such standard formats, it's
impossible to send that kind of e-mail. As a result, it's not surprising
that EDI messages are usually sent through networks that cater exclusively
to EDI users, or that Next's voice e-mail can only be used by Next
computers.
   On the other hand, when it comes to addressing a message, e-mail has no
lack of standards. If anything, there are far too many addressing
standards. For a letter sent via the postal service, there's a unique,
relatively simple address for every possible destination. But, when the
message is e-mail, the address can be highly complex, and messages going to
the same destination can have addresses that vary widely depending on the
sender. In some cases, messages with the same sender and receiver can be
properly addressed in different ways. How can the sender be sure the
address is correct?
   In simple terms, the problem is compatibility-the lack of a
well-accepted, dominant standard for e-mail addressing and formatting.
Fortunately, proponents of each of the two most widely used flavors of
e-mail-SMTP and X.400-are working to solve that problem by creating address
and format standards. Unfortunately, they're not necessarily working to
provide compatibility between the two camps.

SMTP
SMTP is the e-mail protocol used by most UNIX users in the United States.
The reason is simple: the "backbone" for sending messages is the
government-funded collection of networks called the Internet. It was
Internet users who developed SMTP to route e-mail between Internet sites.
Strictly speaking, the Internet is only for use by U.S. defense
contractors, but many Internet sites are also connected to other networks,
including commercial networks such as UUNET. As a result, a large number of
U.S. UNIX users can send e-mail to one another, as well as to many other
sites throughout the world.
   Although SMTP's "first name" is Simple, using it can be more complicated
than anyone would like it to be. A major problem stems from the fact that
SMTP has two widely used systems of addressing. In the first, it's up to
the sender to specify the path the message will travel to its destination.
That usually requires knowing the name of a major site connected to a
backbone network, and then specifying the names of other specific network
nodes on the way to the user, all separated by exclamation points (!). For
example, uunet!uworld!frankh begins with a backbone site (uunet), followed
by a node connected to it (uworld), followed by the user's name (frankh).
Depending on which backbone sites the addressee is connected to, many
different valid addresses may be used for the same destination.
   The solution to that confusion is the other major form of SMTP
addressing, the domain name system (DNS). In DNS, the e-mail system itself
maintains a directory of unique node names, so the sender need only specify
the "home machine" and user: frankh@uworld.com. DNS is steadily being
adopted for SMTP mail, but the older addressing style is still common. To
make matters worse, some senders choose addresses that mix the two styles,
such as uunet!frankh@uworld.com-a confusing, non-standard address that
results in the e-mail being delivered successfully on some networks and
returned as undeliverable on others.
   And although SMTP is older and better-established than other kinds of
e-mail, its age creates another problem: All contents of an SMTP mail
message, including the address, must be in a form that requires only seven
bits per byte, such as ASCII text. Non-text messages like voice, EDI, and
binary computer code require eight bits per byte, so such binary messages
must first be somehow encoded into seven-bit text.

X.400
X.400 e-mail is based on an international standard designed to solve many
of the problems associated with SMTP mail. The X.400 standard was developed
by a working group of CCITT, the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee. The original standard was released in 1984, and in
1988 was expanded to include formats for non-text binary messages.
   In X.400, every destination has only one address that consists of a
series of ever-more-specific locations, beginning with the addressee's
country and working down to the user's account name. As with SMTP's DNS,
the address is unique, but in X.400 it's stored in binary form in the
e-mail's header section. This means the header must be created by a special
program called a "user agent," which encodes the address and packages the
message contents for mailing. As a result, the user-agent software can
request the address from the sender in any appropriate form, and the
address details can be hidden from the sender if desired. In addition,
because the body of an X.400 message can be binary, it's much easier to
send non-text messages that must be re-encoded for SMTP mail-at least in
theory.
   In practice, although X.400 may be technically superior to SMTP mail, it
lacks the infrastructure and support services that SMTP users enjoy from
the Internet-such as directory systems, help for addressing problems, and
widely available software for packaging mail into the proper X.400 form.
That's a major reason X.400 is more popular in Europe than in the United
States. Because there's no Internet to provide a strong, reliable
infrastructure for SMTP in Europe, users must create their own support
services which makes SMTP less attractive outside the United States.
   Another drawback is that many existing X.400 mail systems use the older,
1984 version of the standard, which limits its advantages. For example, the
U.S. version of X.400 is largely used by commercial e-mail carriers such as
MCI and AT&T. They use X.400-1984, which doesn't specify exact formats for
different kinds of binary mail, and as a result, each carrier must specify
its own binary mail formats, and messages sent from one carrier to another
are limited to ordinary text.

Competition and Cooperation
Work is not at a standstill on either SMTP or X.400. SMTP's advantage is
the excellent infrastructure support its users get from the Internet. To
encourage use and support of X.400 on the Internet, a project at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison is working to build some of the basic
support systems necessary to make X.400 easily usable on the
Internet-including user-agent software and directory services. The X.400
Internet project is also specifying the implementation details for many
kinds of X.400 binary mail, so that Internet and commercial X.400 users
will be able to send and receive non-text e-mail-regardless of where it
originates or how many networks it must cross.
   But X.400's lead in non-text messages won't last. An Internet technical
group is working on a specification, called Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extension (MIME), that will allow SMTP mail to contain non-text messages.
   Will competition between partisans of the two e-mail styles torpedo
compatibility between them? Probably not. Most users don't care whether
their messages use SMTP or X.400-what's important to them is that the mail
must go through. Currently, that means messages sent between networks may
require a lowest-common-denominator approach-text only. In the future,
appropriate gateways should make it possible to send non-text messages
between SMTP and X.400, by translating from the binary-format
specifications being developed by the Internet X.400 project and the SMTP
MIME extensions.
   Realistically, X.400 is the e-mail wave of the future. But thanks to the
strength of SMTP, that wave may crest for most of the world long before
X.400 becomes dominant in the United States. Still, if the Internet
projects to fill in the gaps in each style of e-mail are successful, they
may eventually converge. When that happens, SMTP and X.400-and especially
their users-will be the winners.

METATOOL TO THE RESCURE

By:
Omri Serlin


Sience the early days of computing, a problem that has loomed larger than
others has been how to bridge arcane sequences of logic signals-which are
the only language a computer really understands-to forms of expression
humans can read, write, and comprehend.
   The quest to accomplish this has led to two separate but complementary
solutions. One is the development of operating systems, linking loaders,
I/O drivers, and standard utilities. In addition to allowing users to
manipulate system components using relatively simple abstractions, these
tools help manage the resources of computer systems. Recent examples
include the type of system software that automatically manages file
migration between multiple levels of system storage, such as main memory,
extended memory, disk drives, and robot-arm tape drives.
   From the users' point of view, a more interesting development has been
that of automatic programming systems. Even a simple assembler, which is
today considered not much different than "machine language," introduces a
programming interface that humans find significantly easier to manipulate.
For instance, when was the last time you tried to create a program using
hexadecimal or octal notation?
   Compilers, such as Fortran and Cobol, created an even higher level of
abstraction, and allowed humans to write programs in languages that were
much closer to the intended application. To a mathematician, the statement
X = SQRT(A**2 + B**2) makes a lot more sense than the equivalent sequence
of a dozen or so obscure machine-language instructions. Similarly, Cobol
provides facilities to define and manipulate files and records in terms
readily understood by commercial application developers.

SDTs: The Next Step
The next step along this path has been referred to as fourth-generation
languages (4GLs), applications generators, or non-procedural languages.
These tools allow programmers to define an application in terms that are
even closer to the application's own semantics. Unlike the strictly
sequential nature of procedural languages like Fortran, Cobol, C, and
Pascal, these more modern tools allow applications to be defined as block
diagrams-that is, a collection of processing tasks and the
interrelationships between them.
   These tools are increasingly being referred to as specification-driven
tools or SDTs. They have become the heart of many of the computer-aided
software engineering (CASE) systems currently offered by a host of
vendors-the IEF, for information engineering facility, product family from
Texas Instruments Inc., for example.
   A SDT reads a specification-a description of an application in a
language that is tailored to that application-and generates a "product" in
response. The product is often a description or source code of the same
application in a more conventional programming language, such as C, that
can be compiled and executed.
   Until now, the creation of an SDT was a difficult process, but a number
of vendors are currently proposing to ease the task of creating SDTs by
providing an SDT builder (SDTB). An SDTB is in itself an SDT. Because its
output is another SDT, rather than an application, an SDTB can be
considered a meta-SDT. One example, Metatool, is being marketed by AT&T
Bell Laboratories.
   Rather than read an application specification, as a conventional SDT
would do, Metatool reads two kinds of specification files: one describing
the source language to be used to define the application; the other
describing the desired product that the resulting SDT is expected to
produce. The output of the SDTB is the source code for the desired
application-specific SDT. Once compiled, and augmented with macros and
library routines, this SDT will be capable of reading the application
specification and producing the desired product.
   More than one product can be specified by using a separate
specification, or product description file, for each.
   AT&T's Metatool has been used under its original name, Stage, in more
than 100 internal software development projects with observed programmer
productivity improvements from 4:1 to 40:1. In addition, the use of the
SDTB resulted in improved software quality and delivery schedules,
according to AT&T.

Measuring Productivity
As with all CASE tools, productivity, quality, and timeliness claims are
rough estimates at best. Quantitative comparisons require setting up and
measuring two independent development projects, with one using the tools
and the other using conventional programming techniques.
   Nevertheless, at least one reasonable quantitative measure is available,
and with it AT&T has been able to support its productivity claims. The
reasoning goes something as follows: If an application program contains
2,000 lines of code (LOCs), using an SDT tool, perhaps 250 lines of
specifications are needed to produce the 2,000 LOCs-an 8:1 improvement. Of
course, creating the SDT tool by hand could require writing 8,000 LOCs.
This still may be quite acceptable if the investment in the SDT is
amortized over numerous applications.
   However, using Metatool, perhaps only 500 lines of code are required to
populate the source and product description files. In this case, a 2.7:1
productivity advantage is achieved. The productivity gain is increased if
the SDT can be reused many times.
   Metatool, and other products of the same ilk, are likely to excel in
short-term applications for which the target SDT is used for relatively
simple processing tasks. In principle, an SDTB could be used to create,
say, a complete language compiler. In fact, Metatool and the target SDT
created by it use tools including lex and yacc to perform their tasks.
These old UNIX standbys provide the lexical analysis and parsing functions,
respectively; which are crucial elements of any translator, compiler, or
SDT. But creating the description files for a full-featured, complex
language requires above-average programming skills, which, in effect,
defeats the purpose of an SDTB.
   Another reason that short-term, simple usage is the preferred
environment for applying Metatool is that the efficiency of the generated
code produced by the target SDT isn't as good as what might be obtained by
direct-coding of the application. This discrepancy is a common
characteristic of application generators and SDTs. In addition, the
specific way in which Metatool creates the parse tree-a formal, internal
representation of the input language-contributes to this shortcoming. The
gains in productivity are usually more than enough to justify the
inefficiency of the generated code, however. Another problem is that yacc
error messages are not as precise as one would wish in identifying the
offending code.
   Metatool is an interesting approach to simplifying the construction of
complex UNIX applications. In principle, Metatool can even be used to
create SDTs for environments other than UNIX, and has been used in a number
of projects for various hardware platforms. Within its limitations,
Metatool should prove useful to application and system builders.
