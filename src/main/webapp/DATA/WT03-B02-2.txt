Funding Problems Delay Iowa CHMIS Date


With implementation costs higher than expected, a July deadline for starting
Iowa's state-sanctioned community health management information system likely
will be delayed at least one year.

The Iowa CHMIS program-including a centralized state data repository and
certification of claims clearinghouses-could be headed back to the drawing
board after four vendor bids for building and operating the data repository
came in at least $1.5 million over projections.

On Dec.  15, the Iowa CHMIS governing board voted to recommend to state
legislators that the mandate to start the program this July be postponed for
one year.  And administrative rules released for public comment in December to
implement a certification program for transaction processing networks are on
hold.

The repository and other activities of the program were to be funded by a
transaction fee surcharge of about 3 cents on electronically transmitted
claims and other transactions.  But because the project costs are higher than
anticipated, the surcharge would approach 18 cents plus membership fees,
violating a tenet of the program that it provide overall savings.

Four bids on the data repository ranged from $6 million to $7 million over
five years, which were $1.5 million to $2 million more than anticipated.

"When we started this process, we always recognized the volatility of the
cost/benefit process," says Walter Tomenga, Iowa CHMIS chair and vice
president of the Farm Bureau Insurance Companies.  "We knew we wouldn't be
able to understand the total cost ramifications until we put a system together
and put it out for bid.  We've not backed away from our commitment; we're now
looking at different models."

A 15-member task force began weekly meetings on Jan.  4 hoping to draft a new
CHMIS program by March, but some question how much can be saved.  "The bottom
line is the stakeholders are not willing to pay for one centralized
repository," says Susan Voss, projects director for the Iowa Division of
Insurance, which has regulatory jurisdiction over the program.  "It's good
that the board decided to take another look rather than rush into
implementation only to find out it's not working."

Local Links First

Outside observers concur, saying local health information networks need to be
well established before statewide efforts can succeed.  "A statewide
initiative is premature at this point," says Pamela Hanlon, president of
Community Medical Network Society, Atlanta, an association for those
interested in networking issues.  "We are not seeing successful state networks
at this time."

Since lawmakers enacted legislation in 1994 to create the centralized data
repository and require that all providers and payers be linked to certified
clearinghouses by this July, the electronic data interchange environment has
changed in Iowa.

As a result of the looming state government mandate and national growth of EDI
implementation, providers and payers are well on the road to using a range of
electronic transactions.  As a result, many of the goals of CHMIS already are
being accomplished.  "Just the threat of all this has made a lot of groups
move," Voss says.

For instance, CHMIS organizers anticipated that such transactions as
eligibility verification, preauthorization of treatment and electronic funds
transfers eventually would be significant income-generators for the program.
But vendors already are widely marketing these and other EDI services in the
state.

"A lot of the original concepts embedded in CHMIS-we can look at the private
sector and see that they're doing that now," Tomenga says.

In addition, larger payers and provider organizations already collect and
analyze all types of data and don't see a business need to increase data
collection or share it with the state, Voss adds.

"One of the frustrations that people have is when the government says, 'Give
us all of your data and then we'll decide later what to do with it,'" says
Richard Rubin, executive director of the Foundation for Health Care Quality, a
Seattle-based national CHMIS resource center.  "The original CHMIS model has
not proven to be viable."

Another byproduct of the CHMIS program as the original July 1996 deadline
neared is new interest in a national clearinghouse accreditation program that
Iowa adopted.

"We've had a number of companies apply in part because of Iowa," says Lee
Barrett, executive director of the Electronic Health Network Accreditation
Commission.  Those companies include Athena of North America, Louisville, Ky.;
MDIP Inc., Sioux Falls, S.D.; and The ISYS Group, Des Moines, Iowa.

Iowa was the first state to adopt the commission's standards, with Maryland
expecting to follow suit this year.

Barrett hopes the trend will continue, regardless of the setback in Iowa.  "It
certainly added credence to what we're trying to do to promote certification
across the nation," he says.

For now, nearly everything is on the table as Iowa CHMIS supporters craft a
new program.  "We have two stakes in the ground that are not movable:  the
collection of data and standardized transactions," Tomenga says.

Despite the funding setback, Iowa's CHMIS isn't dead, Hanlon says.  "They're
going to pull something off that will be good for their constituency and that
they can afford," she says.  "It just will look different."

Why WEDI And ANSI Are Working Together To Boost Standardization


The American National Standards Institute's ASC X12N insurance subcommittee
and the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange are joining forces to
develop educational programs to increase the use of standardized electronic
health care claims and related transactions.

Following an open forum in December at the X12N interim meeting to discuss
problems with implementing the ANSI 837 claims transaction set, the two
organizations are discussing ways to coordinate development of more
educational programs.

WEDI and X12N organized the forum in Kansas City, Mo., to determine whether
low acceptance of the X12 837 standard format for claims is due to technical
flaws in the standard or other factors (see HDNN, Nov.  20, 1995).

While the standard is maligned by many in the industry as being too complex,
it is technically sound, providers and payers at the forum agreed.

Attendees pointed to a lack of educational efforts as a major reason ASC X12
standards are not widely used in health care.

"A lot of people don't know where to go for information," says Bruce Horn,
manager of electronic commerce for The Associated Group, an Indianapolis-based
payer, and co-chair of the X12N health care task group.  "We don't have the
infrastructure to help these people."

Some say the meeting provided a "wake-up call" to WEDI.

"It is a golden opportunity for WEDI to make something happen, and hopefully
they got that message," says Gary Beatty, electronic commerce manager for
Employers Health Insurance Co., Green Bay, Wis.

WEDI Responds

Message received, replies Gene Carruth, vice president of Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Arizona and WEDI treasurer.  "We can be a conduit to help get
educational materials out to grassroots organizations," he adds.

But WEDI likely will not hold educational forums, says Gina Grage,
reimbursement coordinator for Mayo Medical Center and co-chair of WEDI's
educational technical advisory group.

Rather, WEDI will help local entities, such as medical associations or EDI
resource centers, put on seminars by developing educational materials and
creating a speakers bureau.

For instance, the WEDI advisory group is putting the finishing touches on a
slide presentation on the basic issues of electronic commerce in the health
care industry.

WEDI's commitment to assisting local educational efforts is good news for some
attendees of the special X12N forum, who worried that the two organizations
would settle for having special educational seminars at future X12N or WEDI
meetings that providers and payers would have to travel hundreds of miles to
attend.

"Whoever does the education will have to go out to the masses," says Paul
Montgomery, EDI translation specialist at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Kansas.  "The masses will not go out to EDI."

Still, 185 people attended the special X12N/WEDI meeting in December on only
30 days notice, a sign that there clearly is interest in the health care
community to standardize transactions, Horn says.

Uniform Implementation

Those attending the meeting told X12N and WEDI leaders that increased use of
the ANSI 837 is hampered by the lack of a uniform implementation guide.

For instance, at least six industry groups, including WEDI, have written
implementation guides.

But this problem should be resolved during 1996, as X12N is beginning to write
standardized, low-cost implementation guides for the 837 and other transaction
sets.

Some pioneers who have implemented the ANSI 837 caution that there are no
shortcuts to the procedure.

Because mainframe-based translation software can cost as much as $200,000,
many organizations are trying to implement the standard by writing translation
software themselves-and doing it wrong.

Following implementation guidelines properly and using commercially available
translation software can ease the implementation task, Beatty says.

He advises organizations to start slowly with personal computer-based
translation software and enhance their systems as they gain knowledge about
translation and data mapping issues.  "Don't build your own-that will slow
implementation," he says.

Today's PCs are powerful enough to handle transmitting many claims-related
transactions in large volumes.

For instance, Employers Health Insurance Co.  recently sent eligibility
rosters of 1.8 million people to a major pharmaceutical company from one PC
using a $3,500 off-the-shelf translator.  The transfer took about 10 hours.
The expected 25,000 daily eligibility transactions will take about 10 minutes.

Organizations considering buying a translator need to do some homework
beforehand to gain a better understanding of translation technology and what's
needed to fulfill business needs, says Daniel Kazzaz, president of Paper Free
Systems Inc., a translation software vendor in Fairfax, Va.

Once a vendor is selected, the buyer should get the software on a trial basis,
along with sample maps for transferring one claim format into another, he
adds.

Kazzaz applauds enhanced educational programs to implement standardized
transactions but warns that many people want quick answers.  "People mean
different things by education," he says.  "What they really mean is they want
someone to tell them, 'These products work and these don't.'"

How Telemedicine Is Improving Emergency Care In North Carolina


A handful of hospitals in North Carolina are testing telemedicine
consultations between emergency physicians at rural hospitals and academic
medical centers with a long-term goal of expanding the program statewide.

In planning for more than a year, the pilot program began on October 1 as
physicians at 49-bed Chatham Hospital in Siler City began consulting with
counterparts at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel
Hill.  That was followed later that month when Bowman Gray Medical Center,
Winston-Salem, linked with Wilkes Regional Medical Center, North Wilkesboro.

In November, teleconsultations began between the Duke University Medical
Center, Durham, and the Southeastern Regional Medical Center, Lumberton.  East
Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, and Pungo District
Hospital, Belhaven, began telemedicine consultations in December.  Project
organizers also hope to create links between the U.S.  Naval Hospital,
Jacksonville, and the East Carolina School of Medicine.

"We want to test the telemedicine equipment in an emergency room setting to
see if it can be used effectively to diagnose and treat diseases from a
distance, and whether it will be a viable resource to rural hospitals," says
Gayle Fitzgerald, project manager for the North Carolina Telemedicine Network
and a policy analyst with the Office of State Planning, the state agency
overseeing the project.

Camera Shy

Participants already have learned some lessons.  Chatham Hospital spent 45
days familiarizing its staff with the equipment and helping them over their
fear of being filmed.

"Emergency room people aren't shy individuals but when you try to get them on
camera they get that way quick," Chatham CEO Ted Chapin says.

Workstations-one telediagnostics and another teleradiology-are housed at both
UNC and Chatham.  The backbone of the network is the North Carolina
Information Highway, a fiber-optic network developed by the state and
telephone companies.  The network uses high-speed asynchronous transfer mode
switching technology that simultaneously routes huge amounts of voice, data
and video communications.

The telemedicine program-and the fiber-optic backbone-are part of a larger
effort in North Carolina to develop a comprehensive health information
networking infrastructure statewide.

The effort began in 1994 when Gov.  James Hunt created the North Carolina
Health Care Information and Communications Alliance-comprising information
systems companies, state universities, government agencies, hospitals and
physicians-to map out the state's health information networking strategy (see
Automated Medical Payments News, Sept.  20, 1994).  Among other projects, the
alliance is developing a statewide master patient index, which will undergo
initial testing this spring.

The telemedicine project has cost about $2.6 million so far, including a
$550,000 grant the network received in 1994 from the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, an agency of the U.S.
Department of Commerce.

Funding Concerns

The project is scheduled to end in April but North Carolina will ask NTIA for
a six-month extension of time-but no additional funding-to collect more data
to analyze the benefits of the program.  Participants experienced delays of up
to six months in implementing the program because it took longer than
anticipated to identify and acquire the necessary equipment, Fitzgerald says.

While the project now focuses on emergency department applications at a
limited number of sites, participants hope to expand the network and include
scheduled consultations, but funding is a major concern.

Because of the emergency nature of the telemedicine consultations during the
test, the network operates on dedicated telecommunication lines that are open
24 hours a day.

"The expense of operating the fiber optics network is fairly great because
there aren't that many sites connected to it, but that cost should drop
dramatically as more sites are connected," says William Mattern, senior
associate dean for academic affairs at the University of North Carolina School
of Medicine at Chapel Hill.

The monthly line charges-at least $4,000 per participant-is shared by the
state and the hospitals.  In April, state funding expires and hospitals will
bear the full cost, Fitzgerald says.

Physicians using the network are doing so pro bono because very few insurance
companies or health plans pay for telemedicine consultations.

But with the Health Care Financing Administration paying for some telemedicine
services in a limited pilot program, Fitzgerald hopes payers eventually will
provide reimbursement if the federal program proves telemedicine is
cost-effective.

Meanwhile, the state is negotiating with regional telephone companies for
reduced charges for the telemedicine program.  If the negotiations are
unsuccessful, the scope of the program will be reduced, Fitzgerald says.

Participating providers praise the telemedicine program.  "It puts us on the
cutting edge for a small rural hospital, and physicians like the security of
having consultative expertise at their beck and call," Chapin says.

"The fact that physicians can talk to each other, look at images and hear
sounds with the patient participating offers huge advantages in terms of
providing care," Mattern adds.

Issues that participants hope to address during the pilot programs include the
cost-effectiveness of telemedicine, liability concerns and the willingness of
physicians to use the teleconsulting service on a regular basis after the
pilots are over.

By using telemedicine, smaller hospitals can treat and admit more patients,
rather than transferring patients to other hospitals.  "We're trying to save
patients money, and the payback for me would be an increase in the hospital
census," Chapin says.

The University of North Carolina School of Medicine takes a long-term view of
the program's potential benefits.

"The real payback will be when managed care becomes the predominant method of
care in the state and medical care is capitated," Mattern says.  "In the long
run it will be less expensive to take care of patients without having them
travel to medical centers, and telemedicine looks like it can be an extremely
valuable tool in allowing patients to remain at local sites."

Maryland's Certification Program Remains On Track


While Iowa's effort to mandate state certification of clearinghouses is on
hold, a less ambitious certification effort is rolling along in Maryland.

Under rules being promulgated now, clearinghouses can seek state
certification, which includes meeting certain performance standards and
committing to being an open network that accepts all claims, beginning July 1.
Clearinghouses will gain state certification by being accredited by the
Electronic Health Network Accreditation Commission, an industry-sponsored
national program.

Maryland decided against mandating state certification because the state's
attorney general said a mandate could violate due process laws by depriving
businesses of the right to operate in the state without the benefit of
redress.

But while the program is voluntary, there's an extra incentive that kicks in a
year later.  By July 1997, all payers operating in the state must designate at
least one certified clearinghouse from which they will accept claims.

"We don't see any other way for there to be guarantees of open networks
without payers having at least one open door," says Benjamin Steffen, deputy
director of the Maryland Health Care Access and Cost Commission, the agency
responsible for the certification program.  Market pressures likely will force
most clearinghouses to eventually seek state certification, he adds.

Maryland decided to adopt the Electronic Health Network Accreditation
Commission's program after its confidentiality provisions were strengthened in
December to address the state's concerns.  Now, accredited clearinghouses have
to spell out in contracts how end users will use data transmitted through
their networks.

With MedAccess, Employees Get More Plan Information The Cyberspace Way


Open enrollment, an annual ritual for employees and employers, is about to
leap into cyberspace.

This month, MedAccess Corp., a privately-owned, start-up company based in
Lexington, Mass., is introducing a new service enabling employees to access
information about their health insurance plans on the Internet.

The service, Health Fair Online, targets corporations employing at least 500
people, says Jaime Taaffe, founder and CEO of MedAccess.

An employer would pay MedAccess a fee to provide detailed, current information
on its health plan options to its employees on the MedAccess World Wide Web
page.  The company already has assembled a massive database of information on
virtually every managed care plan in the country, Taaffe says.

In October, Health Fair Online was tested at GTE Laboratories, Waltham, Mass.
Over a three-week open enrollment period during which the company offered the
choice of seven different health plans, about half of its 500 employees
accessed plan information on-line via MedAccess.

Available Information

The information included marketing materials for the seven managed care plans,
audio messages from the plans' senior executives, the background and
availability of physicians in those plans, the contracts between GTE and the
plans and information from the Health Plan Employer Data Information Set, a
standardized set of quality and performance measurements used to compare
managed care plans.

By calling up the Web site and then entering a social security number and a
pin number, employees could find out what their contribution and that of GTE
were to the health plan in the past year and compare those costs to the plans
being offered for the coming year.  Employees also could run scenarios
pertaining to their personal and family health care circumstances to learn
what plan may suit them best and its cost.

Based on the pilot program and a survey of GTE employees, MedAccess concluded
that employees are willing to go on-line for health plan information, Taaffe
says.

"The overwhelming majority said the information influenced their decision and
people found it very convenient because we were able to provide more
information and it was easy to navigate," he adds.

Responding to requests from GTE employees, MedAccess will add more information
on health-related areas such as life and disability insurance.

The interactive service provides more information in a more efficient manner
than other options, such as giving employees brochures, Taaffe says.  This
results in better informed employees and helps them choose the best plan for
their needs rather than selecting a plan simply because it has the lowest
cost, he adds.

GTE Corp., the parent company of GTE Laboratories, is looking for programs to
give its employees assistance in choosing the best quality plans because
"quality is cheaper," says Dwight McNeill, health care information manager for
GTE Corp.

Health Fair Online is feasible and less expensive than the traditional ways
corporations have sought to inform employees about their health plan choices,
he adds.  "I imagine the cost would be 25% of the cost of mailing and printing
paper."

While GTE Laboratories was pleased with the performance of MedAccess, its
parent company hasn't decided if it will retain the service, McNeill says.
GTE Laboratories agreed to test the service because its corporate office is
near MedAccess', and it was familiar with the firm and its personnel.

GTE Corp.  employs about 100,000 people in the United States.  Before the
company can decide whether to further utilize MedAccess, it must sell the
concept to the various divisions, McNeill says.  While he is impressed with
MedAccess, McNeill says it could use more video, graphics and color.

Taaffe declines to say whether MedAccess has signed any customers for its roll
out.  The cost of the service will depend on the company's size and the scope
of its health care benefits.  The company has a demonstration Web site at
http://www.medaccess.com.

Using The Internet To Find Community Physicians


A new Internet service rolling out in March will enable members of managed
care plans to use personal computers to find affiliated physicians in their
community.

GeoAccess Inc., Overland Park, Kan., developed the service, called Referral
Online, which is free of charge for health plan members.  Insurance companies
and other payers will pick up the cost, which varies due to membership and
other factors but averages about $12,000 a year.

GeoAccess, formed in 1989, specializes in software and consulting services
that help its 300 payer clients measure health care access issues.

For instance, managed care plans can use the software to compare the employee
addresses of prospective employer clients with addresses of the plan's
regionally contracted providers, showing the degree of access to care that
employees would have under the plan.  GeoAccess also markets software to
create provider directories.

In essence, Referral Online takes these existing services and reformats them
for health plan membership use on the Internet.

To use Referral Online, a plan member dials up a Web site-either for the
health plan or at GeoAccess-and enters his or her street address.  After the
member selects a physician specialty from a subsequent menu, a listing of area
contracted physicians with address, telephone number and distance from the
member's home is displayed.

Health plans can make additional information available, such as office hours
and bilingual services.  In addition, Referral Online can search for
individual physicians by name.

A Web site demonstration is available at http://www.geoaccess.com.

To Thrive In Managed Care, Oregon Docs Take The Health Data Network
Initiative


While several state medical associations have endorsed electronic claims
clearinghouses and obtained discounted rates as an incentive for members to
use electronic data interchange, few, if any, have gone so far as to develop
an electronic network.

Thus, the Oregon Medical Association is blazing a trail as it introduces a
statewide health information network, which could evolve to look much like a
community health information network.

Tested in the Portland area during the latter half of 1995, the Oregon Medical
Electronic Network is a "custom health care network" tailored to the needs of
its users, and those needs will determine how the network will evolve, says
Robert Dernedde, the medical association's executive director.

The medical association developed the network to help member physicians
successfully compete in the state's growing managed care business.

"It dawned on us that there was only one way we could help the medical
community survive this demand and that was to automate the administrative
process," Dernedde says.

Available Transactions

The network now enables physicians to verify insurance eligibility with
participating payers, refer patients to other physicians and communicate with
other users via electronic mail.

Other services scheduled for testing in 1996 include submitting claims to
participating payers, submitting certain prescriptions to pharmacies,
submitting laboratory orders and receiving results and submitting workers'
compensation injury reports.

The network doesn't include a centralized data repository, but expects to
eventually assist physicians in creating computer-based patient records.  How
that will be accomplished has yet to be determined, Dernedde says.

But before the network reaches that stage, it will have to address such thorny
issues as confidentiality and ownership of the information, he adds.

This month, the network began connecting members of the Salem-based Mid-Valley
Independent Physicians Association, whose 368 members practice at about 160
sites in two eastern counties, to the network.

Already connected are 146 physicians at 22 sites in the Portland area who were
hand-picked to participate in the pilot because they had a variety of
different information systems.

Participating Payers

The eight payers that participated in the pilot are:  HMO of Oregon, the
managed care plan of Blue Cross of Oregon; Sisters of Providence Good Health
Plan; ODS Health Plan; Physicians Association of Clackamas County; Pacificare
Inc.; Pacific Source; QualMed Inc.; and the Oregon Medical Assistance Program,
the state Medicaid program.

The state's two major workers compensation carriers-State Accident Insurance
Fund and Liberty Northwest Insurance Corp.-have committed to use the network
and Dernedde expects to hook them up shortly.

Mid-Valley has committed $1.2 million over the next 15 months to hook up
affiliated providers, with 20 sites expected to be on-line by February.

The network also is negotiating with organizations representing about 850
physicians in the Eugene, Springfield and Medford areas.

Physician-Driven

Physicians took the lead in developing the network to avoid political and
competitive problems that have plagued community health information networks
elsewhere.

"If payers or health systems take the lead, then other payers and health
systems won't participate," Dernedde says.  "The physicians are the ones who
ultimately have to provide the encounter data and they need to be able to
access multiple health plans, hospitals, pharmacies and other providers."

Precisely because of the need for connectivity to other providers, the medical
association's network is not limited to its member physicians.  "We're set up
in a non-proprietary way so that all participants who have a legitimate need
to use the highway can come to the table," Dernedde adds.  The network hopes
that as physicians in certain communities join the network, local hospitals,
pharmacies and other providers will join as well.

For now, the network is concentrating on signing up physicians through
independent practice associations or similar groups.  It anticipates serving
most of the 7,000 physicians in the state within five years through deals with
the state's 30 IPAs.

The state medical association chose Peregrin Medical Review, Beaverton, Ore.,
in February 1994 to install and run a frame relay-based network to switch
transactions.

Unlike other vendors, Peregrin understood the network's specific needs,
Dernedde says.  "The others all had their preconceived notions and they wanted
us to fit the round hole when we were square," he adds.

The network uses systems integration software developed by Informedics Inc., a
Lake Oswego, Ore.-based physician practice management software company.  The
software, HealthLink, easily integrates with many practice management systems,
including Informedics' ClinicManager product.

Lessons Learned

Now that the network is operational, the biggest obstacle- and lesson learned
from the pilot-is overcoming the fear of technology among physicians and their
staffs.  "You really have to work with the people in each installation so that
they can get comfortable with the system and will use it regularly," Dernedde
says.

The association hopes the network will enable physicians to communicate with
each other more efficiently and enable them to conduct outcomes research
geographically, by specialty, "or by any other configuration the medical
community might want to put together," Dernedde adds.

For instance, Mid-Valley hopes that electronic connectivity will enhance its
existing data collection and analysis programs.  "What we're really interested
in is having access to our raw data to do outcomes-based studies," says Jan
Buffa, Mid-Valley's CEO.

Mid-Valley operates its own data repository, downloading information from
certain health care payers on a quarterly basis.  But the Oregon network will
give it access to greater data on a more timely basis and enhance its data
collection capabilities, she adds.

Mid-Valley, the IPA in Salem, expects its investment in the network to pay for
itself within two years through reductions in administrative expenses and
increased staff productivity, says Michael Rohwer, a member of the
organization's board of directors and a general internist with the Doctors
Clinic, in Salem.  The Oregon Clinic, a multi-specialty facility in Portland
that participated in the pilot, already relies heavily on the network for
checking the insurance eligibility of patients, says Regina Tipton, the
practice's computer education coordinator.

"I don't know what the cost savings are, but if you take one individual who's
making $8 an hour who calls up the insurance company and waits 45 minutes to
get the answer, versus using the network and getting the information within
two minutes; we absolutely will get a lot more done," she adds.

The medical association expects to eventually profit from the network, but
Dernedde declines to say when profitability is expected or what the
association's investment has been.

Members of the medical association pay an average of $3,100 to $3,500 to join
the network, plus a monthly software licensing fee of $50.

The association, which has 5,263 members, including 4,300 practicing
physicians, charges non-members an additional $50 monthly surcharge.

The Pharmacy Fund Looks For Rapid Expansion Of Its Rapid RxEmit Program


Having signed more than 300 pharmacies in 30 states to its Rapid RxEmit
receivables financing program in the past year, The Pharmacy Fund is preparing
to double the number of participating pharmacies.

Since December 1994, The Pharmacy Fund, a New York-based receivables financing
company, has paid more than 1.1 million claims the next business day through
the short-term receivables financing program.

To fund the receivables financing effort, The Pharmacy Fund is using about $25
million in investments from company officials and companies such as Mutual of
Omaha and Centre Financial Services Holdings Ltd.  But the fund has been
attempting since September to draw $80 million on a $500 million line of
credit arranged by Smith Barney to expand the program to 335 other pharmacies
that have committed to joining.

This month the fund expects to close on the $80 million in new financing,
ending months of frustrating legal maneuverings.

"We thought we could do this relatively simply," says Pharmacy Fund President
Jeffrey Greene.  "The legal bill is twice what was expected.  We have hundreds
of pharmacies signed up and we can't give them a start date until the lawyers
are finished."

How It Works

Rapid RxEmit uses electronic data interchange to process claims and evaluate
the credit risk of prescription payers.  Pharmacies using Rapid RxEmit submit
claims through National Data Corp., Atlanta, to the respective payers.  The
payers adjudicate the claims and transmit remittance advice back to the
pharmacies through National Data.  But payers also transmit copies of
adjudicated claims to the Pharmacy Fund.

The fund then uses evaluation software to check for duplicate or denied
claims, or claims from unapproved payers.  Only one-half of one percent of
claims are from payers that have payment histories so poor that the fund won't
buy the claims, Greene says.

The Pharmacy Fund pays approved claims the next business day, primarily
through direct deposit to pharmacy bank accounts.  The fund charges a fee
equal to 2% of each claim financed, and then assumes responsibility for
getting payment from payers.

The program dramatically improves cash flow for pharmacies, which often wait
30 to 90 days for payment and find the 2% fee money well spent.  "When you're
waiting more than 30 days for payment, you're really financing the
prescription program of these health plans," says Lou Giannotti, director of
pharmacies for Mayfair Super Markets, Elizabeth, N.J.  "The fund remedies the
task of chasing the receivables."

About 80% of claims for Mayfair's 12 pharmacies are paid the next business
day.  Most of the remaining claims are for the New Jersey Medicaid program,
which may join Rapid RxEmit later this year.

The Pharmacy Fund's evaluation software includes credit and payment histories
of 2,800 prescription payers, ranging from major corporations such as General
Motors Co.  to two volunteer fire departments.

To assess the credit risk of payers, the fund pulls reports from
investment-grading companies such as Moody's Investor Service, Standard &
Poor's Corp.  and Fitch Investor Service Inc.

Other reports come from Dun & Bradstreet Inc.  and state insurance divisions.
But the best source of information, Greene says, is The Pharmacy Fund's direct
experience with getting paid by the insurers.

One of the biggest challenges of Rapid RxEmit has been convincing payers to
pay The Pharmacy Fund rather than pharmacies.  While most payers agree, the
process is cumbersome.  "Every pharmacy we turn on, we have to notify 20 to 25
payers to change their files and that's all paper-driven," says Fred Tarter,
chairman of the fund.

Why VHA Is Dropping Its Supply-Side EDI Software


A major hospital purchasing coalition is abandoning its proprietary software
for hospitals to submit supply orders electronically because its limited
functionality doesn't address customer needs.  Instead, VHA Inc., Irving,
Texas, is recommending that its member hospitals use the Quik Link materials
management software from Abbott Park, Ill.-based Abbott Laboratories, or the
Echo software from Choice Medical Inc., Louisville, Ky.

Quik Link, which has 900 customers, accommodates purchase orders,
acknowledgments and an electronic catalogue.  Echo offers its 300 customers
those same services, as well as electronic invoicing.  Both software products
support standardized transactions developed by the American National Standards
Institute ASC X12 subcommittee.

VHA is abandoning its own software because its functions are limited to
purchase orders and acknowledgments, and it doesn't accommodate customers'
requirements for easier connections to multiple vendors, says Gregory
Lindstrom, manager of VHA Net Services.  "We won't have to continue to utilize
VHA resources to build and design software, and provide customer and technical
support," he adds.

VHA expects to stop supporting the software by next January.

Abbott, a major manufacturer and distributor of pharmaceutical products and
other health care products, will supply Quik Link free to VHA hospitals.

Choice Medical is offering a 5% discount off the $495 price of the Echo
software.  The company also will offer discounts on annual support fees and
additional modules.

For Abbott, which merely provides software as a service to customers, the VHA
agreement will have little impact.  "We want to encourage our customers to use
EDI technology to keep costs out of the supply chain," says Alan Greenthal,
Abbott's senior systems analyst.

But the agreement will have a big impact on Choice Medical, says Rachel
Foerster, principal and founder of Rachel Foerster and Associates, a Beach
Park, Ill.-based EDI consulting firm.

Choice Medical markets Echo to smaller hospitals, but has more advanced
software, called RSVP, for the complete materials management needs of larger
hospitals.  Thus, the VHA deal gives the company a way to enter the larger
hospital market.

"It has a very positive impact for Choice Medical because they have some very
easy-to-use and affordable systems," Foerster says.  "Quik Link is limited in
functionality compared to Choice's Echo and it's not a full materials
management inventory system like Choice's RSVP."

"The VHA endorsement is almost as good as the Good Housekeeping seal of
approval," says George Puckett, vice president of Choice Medical.

WHIN Expands Its Wisconsin Network Reach


A large Wisconsin independent practice association is committing up to
$500,000 to link its 300 primary care physicians to the Wisconsin Health
Information Network.

The 750-member Community Physicians Network in Sauk City will pay for all
software and training, and a "substantial subsidy" of hardware costs, to
assist 100 clinics in joining the Wisconsin network, says Gary Busack,
director of planning and development with Unity Health Plans.  Busack was
interim executive director of Community Physicians Network when the agreement
was finalized in December.

"The network is a means of Community Physicians Network being able to provide
more data to their members on how they are doing with their managed care
commitments," Busack says.  "This is what primary care needs if it is to be
successful in the future."

The clinics are in 30 southern Wisconsin counties, substantially expanding the
geographical reach of the network, which has concentrated on the Milwaukee and
Madison metropolitan regions.

The Wisconsin Health Information Network is owned by Ameritech Inc.  and
Aurora Health Care, a Milwaukee-based hospital system.

focuses on the Medical Records Confidentiality Act, introduced by Sen.  Robert
Bennett (R-Utah) last fall.

The event is more an informational seminar than a debate on the bill's merits.
"It's a workshop for people who want to understand what the bill does and what
it doesn't do," says WEDI Executive Director Barbara Souder.

Panel members include Paul Yost, legislative director for Sen.  Bennett;
Kathleen Frawley, Washington director of the American Health Information
Management Association; Marjorie Carey, assistant general counsel of the
American Hospital Association; Jeanne Shulte Scott, chair of the Association
for Electronic Health Care Transactions; and Joel Gimpel, associate general
counsel of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.  The forum cost is
$250, but it is free for WEDI conference registrants.  For more information,
call 617-374-9170.

New Database On The Net Gives Health Care Plan Performance Measures


Employers and other purchasers of managed care, as well as consumers, have new
information at their fingertips to help assess the performance of individual
health care plans.

Last month, the National Committee for Quality Assurance rolled out a World
Wide Web site that includes a list of health plans that have obtained NCQA
accreditation and HEDIS report cards that show how the services of a managed
care plan compare to other plans.  Nearly half of the nation's HMOs have been
reviewed as part of NCQA's accreditation program.

The web site also includes NCQA conference information and various
organization publications.

The Internet address for the web site is http://www.ncqa.org.

PCS Veteran Moley Moves To Lead A Sister Company:  Integrated Medical


Integrated Medical Systems, the Golden, Colo.-based health information network
vendor owned by Eli Lilly & Co., has new leadership.

Kevin Moley, senior vice president of PCS Health Systems, is the new president
and CEO of Integrated Medical.  Moley succeeds Kevin Green, who resigned on
Jan.  10 to accept a similar position at an undisclosed company.

Moley was a driving force in PCS' investment in Integrated Medical Systems in
1994.  Eli Lilly bought both companies last year.

Moley, who served as Deputy Secretary of the U.S.  Department of Health and
Human Services in the Bush Administration, was interim CEO of Integrated
Medical Systems during much of 1994.

The company operates 45 health information networks linking hospitals to
affiliated physicians.  The leadership change won't result in philosophical
changes, Moley says.

But he expects to use new capital from Eli Lilly to expand the company's
client base and services.
