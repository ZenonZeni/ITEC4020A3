 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM </H2>

<p>  We probably need more calcium and magnesium than any other vitamin or mineral because they are the primary building blocks of bones, teeth and muscles. Many foods contain these valuable minerals, especially calcium, so many people supplement their diets with calcium...yet calcium remains high on the list of minerals in which people are deficient.</P>
<P>  It is not how much calcium and magnesium you obtain from the foods you eat and supplements you take, but rather how much your body ABSORBS and UTILIZES. Very simply, calcium is difficult to absorb for most people.</P>
<P>  Life Plus understands that the name of the game is absorption and utilization; therefore, CALMAG PLUS is more than just a straight calcium supplement. It includes an abundant amount of magnesium and other specific nutrients your body needs in order to absorb and utilize both calcium and magnesium to its fullest potential. In taking CALMAG PLUS, you have a complete team working for you.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE CALMAG PLUS TEAM</H2>
<P>  Your body needs adequate amounts of magnesium in order to absorb calcium and it also needs adequate amounts of calcium to utilize magnesium. Vitamin D-3 is also included because it is necessary for both the absorption and utilization of calcium, and calcium is needed to utilize vitamin D-3. Any calcium supplement that does not contain calcium, magnesium and vitamin D is simply not of much value in terms of absorption and utilization in the body.</P>
<P>   Betaine HCI, glutaminic acid and the citrate form of calcium ensure that CALMAG PLUS is pH balanced. Proper pH (acid base balance) in the digestive tract is very important for proper calcium absorption.</P>
<P>   Alfalfa, Kelp and Dulce are also included as good sources of calcium and magnesium and all three are rich sources of trace minerals helpful for calcium and magnesium utilization. Boron is added to help maintain calcium levels in the body once it is absorbed. Studies have shown that less calcium is excreted in the urine if adequate levels of Boron are present.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF CALCIUM & MAGNESIUM</H2>
<P>  Many calcium supplements contain only inexpensive, inorganic  forms  of  calcium,  such  as  oxides  or carbonates.  In general, most of these products are not worthwhile because most of the calcium is not absorbed. Different individuals seem to be able to absorb different forms of calcium and magnesium. This is why Life Plus CALMAG PLUS contains numerous sources of calcium and magnesium  including  citrates,  chelates,  aspartates, gluconates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates and lactates.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY TAKE CALMAG PLUS?</H2>
<P>   Individuals who are allergic to dairy products (a major source of calcium in the American diet) can easily become deficient in calcium and need CALMAG PLUS to make up for the loss of this source of calcium.</P>
<P>  During pregnancy, mothers need a great deal of calcium and magnesium to ensure the proper development of the fetal bones, muscles and teeth and to ensure that the mother's own mineral stores are not depleted. For the same reason, lactating mothers should continue to supplement their diets with CALMAG PLUS.</P>
<P>   Growing children need extra calcium in their diets to ensure continuing development of muscles, bones and teeth. If they maintain proper levels of calcium, they will have less tendency toward cavities and broken bones.   CALMAG PLUS is the perfect supplement for them, but they may prefer the chewable Life Plus CANDY CAL tablet.</P>
<P>  Anyone who drinks large amounts of soft drinks need extra amounts of CALMAG PLUS, because of the leaching effects  of  the  ortho  phosphoric  acid. Carbonated, phosophorylated soft drinks are one cause of bone degeneration and the increased incidence of this problem has been shown to correspond to the increased consumption.</P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are absolutely necessary for healthy muscles.   Inadequate levels can lead to muscle cramping, especially in the legs.</P>
<P>   Elderly people find it increasingly difficult to absorb calcium and in general don't seem to get enough magnesium.    They often develop osteoporosis,  a condition  where  calcium  erodes  from  the  bones causing them to become weak and brittle. Elderly people should supplement their diets with Life Plus CALMAG PLUS.</P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are often called "Nature's Tranquilizers" because of their natural calmative effect, not only for muscles but for the nervous system as well.</P>

  <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CALMAG PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CALMAG PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is usually recommended that most people take three CALMAG PLUS tablets two times per day, usually with meals.  This supplies 1,000 mg each of both calcium and magnesium and represents 100% of the RDA for calcium and 250% for magnesium. Individual needs will vary. Older individuals and pregnant or lactating women should consider taking more.</P>
