<b><i>Technologies are available today to cut energy use, reduce costs, and
protect the
environment.  U.S. industry is increasingly involved in developing and using
these
technologies, thanks to the efforts of this office.</b></i>
<p>
<b><i>Overview</b></i><p>
<p>
The goal of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) is to
develop
cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies that protect
the
environment and support the nation's economic competitiveness.  EE achieves
this
goal through a strong and balanced program of research, development, and market
deployment through private sector partnerships.  EE is organized around the
four main
energy users -- utilities, industry, transportation, and buildings -- as well
as an outreach
arm of technical and financial assistance.  This orientation toward end users
has helped
the technology development programs focus on addressing the needs of the
marketplace.  Department of Energy (DOE) projections of energy use indicate
that by
2030, renewables could supply as much as 28% of the nation's energy.
<p>
<b><i>The Office of Utility Technologies</b></i><p>
<p>
Electricity now accounts for 36% of the nation's energy consumption, and its
use is
expected to grow 15% by the end of the century.  Increased energy efficiency
and
renewable energy could play a significant role in meeting that increased
electrical
demand.  To than end, the Office of Utility Technologies (OUT) is working with
industry to improve the cost and performance of renewable energy technologies,
including photovoltaics, solar thermal power, biomass power, wind power,
hydroelectric power, and geothermal energy.  OUT encourages utility energy
efficiency by managing research in advanced transmission and distribution
technologies, high-temperature superconductivity, and energy storage, and by
supporting programs that promote integrated resource planning.  OUT is also
conducting research to evaluate the potential health effects of exposure to
low-
frequency electric and magnetic fields.
<p>
<b><i>The Office of Industrial Technologies</b></i><p>
<p>
Industry accounts for 37% of the energy we consume as a nation.  Virtually
every
manufacturing process uses more energy than necessary.   The Office of
Industrial
Technologies (OIT) collaborates with industry to improve the energy efficiency
and
productivity of industrial processes.  OIT manages programs to reduce energy
use
through new technologies in heat recovery, energy utilization, and industrial
and
municipal waste management.  Other programs develop process improvements and
innovations for specific energy-intensive industries such as pulp and paper,
steel, and
chemicals.  In addition, applied research in combustion, biotechnology,
advanced
materials, and heat transfer will provide the foundation for future advances in
technology.  An active technology transfer program provides an effective link
between
the research and development programs and the community of potential users.
<p>
<b><i>The Office of Transportation Technologies</b></i><p>
<p>
Transportation consumes more than 60% of the oil used in this country, and
almost
half of that oil is imported.  To reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil
and
reduce the air pollution caused by gasoline-powered vehicles, the Office of
Transportation Technologies (OTT) supports research in electric and hybrid
vehicles;
fuel cells and other advanced power sources; alternative fuels made form
biomass and
other renewable energy sources; and advanced materials, such as
high-temperature
ceramics for gas-turbine and diesel engines.  OTT is a partner in the U.S.
Advanced
Battery Consortium -- composed of the three major U.S. automakers, leading
electric
utilities, and battery companies -- working to develop improved batteries for
electric
vehicles.  OTT is also establishing a database on the performance of
alternative-fueled
vehicles and is spearheading the purchase of such vehicles for the federal
fleet.
<p>
<b><i>Office of Building Technology, State, and Community Programs</b></i><p>
<p>
Residential and commercial buildings account for more than one-third of the
nation's
total energy use and consume about two-thirds of the nation's electricity.  The
Office
of Building Technologies (OBT) supports private sector efforts in the building
industry to improve energy efficiency and increase the use of renewable energy. 
OBT
supports basic and applied research on building systems and materials,
primarily
focusing the building envelope and the indoor environment and how they interact
in
determining energy performance.  Other OBT research activities focus on the
equipment that provides heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, hot water, and
other
services necessary for safe, efficient building operation.  OBT also fulfills
legislative
requirements for DOE to set energy efficiency standards for buildings and
household
appliances.
<p>
<b><i>Federal Energy Management Program</b></i><p>
<p>
As the central point of contact within the 100+ Federal agencies, the Federal
Energy Management Program (FEMP) leads an interagency and public/private
partnership to provide private sector financing mechanisms, training, audits
and technology demonstrations to help Federal agencies find their best
investments for saving energy, using renewable energy, and conserving water.
The cornerstone of its efforts is FEMP's development of partnerships between
government agencies and private companies.  The cost of Federal energy
efficiency projects is increasingly being offset with utility incentives and
financing from private energy service companies, which use "energy saving
performance contracts" to pay the up-front costs of efficiency improvements. 
The energy service companies are repaid for the cost of the project with a
share of the resulting energy savings.  A fully implemented FEMP program will
cut Federal energy bills by $1 billion during the next ten years.
