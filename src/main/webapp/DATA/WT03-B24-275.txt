<p><strong>Stop the Racist Church Burnings</strong></p>

<p>The Communist Party, USA joins with all Americans in expressing revulsion and
outrage at the firebombing of the African American churches across the United
States.  As the elections approach, the fire bombings have escalated. It
calls for the broadest urgent fightback response from the anti-racist
majority of the American people.
</p><p>
Newt Gingrich, Jesse Helms and other right-wing extremist politicians in
Washington have created the atmosphere for these hate crimes. There are daily
racist attacks on affirmative action and welfare. There is open instigation
to racist violence by talk-radio hatemongers like Bob Grant. There are the
Supreme Court rulings overturning majority Black and Latino congressional
districts.
</p><p>
The evidence is incontestable. Their aim is to roll back all the gains of the
Civil Rights movement and the New Deal and to terrorize and divide the
growing unity of Black, Brown and white people. It's an attempt to blunt the
resurgent AFL-CIO and the historic alliance between African American churches
and the labor movement.
</p><p>
Look at what life was lost from other hate crimes. Remember the bombing of
the Oklahoma City federal building in which 168 men, women and children of
all races and backgrounds died.
</p><p>
The federal government and law enforcement agencies have failed to vigorously
investigate and apprehend the perpetrators of these vile firebombings.
Instead, federal agents have often treated the victims of the crime as if
they were the perpetrators, interrogating the pastors and grilling church
members to the point of tears. Adding insult to injury, the FBI and Justice
Department has openly questioned whether the church firebombings are a
"conspiracy." We say: There are none so blind as those who will not see!
</p><p>
All who oppose racism should take initiative to demand government action to
halt the burnings. The time is now to build all people's unity to defeat the
forces of racist terrorism and violence. White supremacist groups like the Ku
Klux Klan must be outlawed.
</p><p>
All who cherish democracy must act now. Everyone, every religious
denomination, every labor union, every civil rights and community
organization should demand that the federal government act now to protect
these churches.
</p><p>
The answer to these hate crimes is greater unity and action to defend African
American churches everywhere. And registering millions to vote and defeat the
ultra-right in November gives a most resounding answer to crimes of hate.
