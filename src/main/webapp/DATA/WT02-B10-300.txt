<strong>Welcome to the Zippo News Service</strong><p>
Welcome to Zippo. Zippo News is the product of Zippo Dot Com of Sunnyvale California. Zippo News Services include free public access servers, membership servers, subscription servers, and commercial servers for ISPs and business end users. <p>
<a href="http://www.zippo.com">Original Zippo</a> offers sections for free public access, including an WinSock Apps section, as well as membership services for nntp access and restricted alt.* group access. <a href="http://www.zippo.com/rules.htm">Details</a><p>
<a href="http://super.zippo.com">Super Zippo</a>, an expanded service, is available only to subscription users and commercial customers.<a href="http://super.zippo.com/zns.htm"> Details</a><p>
Zippo provides Usenet, and other forms of Internet news, in a range of 180,000 - 220,000 + articles per day. Zippo offers full read and post access to its users and propagates news throughout the Internet every 15 minutes. Zippo receives news through; local posts, and numerous educational and commercial providers of both US and International origin.<p>
<a name="a1">
<strong>What are the difference between Super Zippo and Original Zippo ?</strong><p>

Super Zippo is a purely commercial subscription service. Original Zippo provides free public access through Direct Read News ™ , with membership only required for groups  requiring restricted access per current US law. The law covers point of origin and we are a US company. Membership also permits nntp news reader access.<p>

Super Zippo has multiple sites for users to access. Currently they are on the West Coast and East Coast. This provides less traffic per site, fewer geographic connecting hops, and redundant service in the event of an outage.<p>

Super Zippo provides 18,000 + news groups, Zippo provides 5,000+. Super Zippo adds groups constantly, Zippo is static, with the exception of updates. Super Zippo permits users to add local unique news groups, Zippo does not.<p>

Super Zippo does not have a time limit on usage, Zippo is limited to a max. of 6 hours in a 24 hour period.<p>

Super Zippo provides expanded FTP software selections, approx. 28 Gbytes to approx. 8 Gbytes for Zippo.<p>

Super Zippo has binary image archives, Zippo does not<p>

Super Zippo provides mailboxes to retail subscribers, Zippo does not.<p>

Super Zippo offers user web pages to 6 and 12 month subscribers.<p>

Super Zippo systems and lines are faster than Zippo. During periods of light access, the systems may appear to be similar in performance, however, as membership grows on Zippo, the system performance will be slower. Super Zippo runs a ratio of users to systems that is maintained at a lower level.<p>

Super Zippo is available at special rates to commercial users, ISPs and Corporate accounts, Zippo is not.<p>

<strong>I just signed up for the service and I can't connect through nntp, or through Direct Read News. What's wrong ?</strong><p>

Did you receive a confirming message from the service or from a Zippo Dot Com representative ? All memberships and subscriptions are automatically processed, 24 hours each day, and then confirmed. If you did not receive a confirmation e-mail within a few minutes of applying, contact us. The typical reson for no confirmation is an incorrect e-mail return address entered on the app.<p>
Super Zippo subscriptions and Zippo membership systems are not the same, one does not give access to the other. Frequently, users going to the wrong system is the problem. The home page and nntp system names, respectively, for Super Zippo are: http://super.zippo.com and snews.zippo.com. The home page and nntp system names for Zippo are http:/www.zippo.com and news.zippo.com. <p>
Case sensitive related issues are the next greatest cause for an inability to connect to either service. Our systems see uppercase and lower case letters as two distinctly different things. Aazz is not the same as AAZZ, or aazz. We took the approach as a security enhancement for passwords and e-mail addresses. Using upper and lower case distinction greatly decreases the probability of some one getting into a user's account.<p>
We entered the password incorrectly for a members account. So far we are running 99.8% accuracy, so the chances for this happening are 2 in 1000. When an e-mail is sent to us in reference to access, the first thing we do is a double test for incorrect entries. Once we have gone through this check, the chances of incorrect password are virtually zero.<p>
Incorrect browser or news reader setup where system information has not been entered, or a version of client software does not support password access. Send us an e-mail message, with the name and version of the access software you are using, and we will work through this with you. <p>
Attempted multiple connections will cause a disconnect. Both Super Zippo and Zippo memberships and subscriptions are for single user access. If a user id and password are already in use, and attempted second log on will interrupt the first. We are asked why we do this, usually with reference to a provider service where passwords may be used many times, simultaneously. <p>
The answer is that they are selling time and we are selling information. Time based services encourage as many people to be on line as possible because their billing is additive, they will charge for every minute a password is in use, so if 10 people are using the service, they will charge for all of them.  We are a flat rate subscription service and do not bill for time, so 10 connections under the same user names consumes 10 times the amount of system resources, but the revenue to us remains the same.<p>

<strong>I have service through an ISP and I cannot access restricted Alt groups. Are you censoring the news ?</strong><p>
Each ISP is provided with two sets of passwords. One permits general access, the second provides complete access. The ISP may distribute these passwords in a manner consistent with their local laws and service policies. <p>
<a name="a4">
<strong>I've posted to Super Zippo, or Zippo, and my posts aren't showing up, what is happening to them ? </strong><p>
Posts through nntp or Direct News, should show up on our servers between 15 minutes and half an hour of being posted. With as many as 220,000 articles coming each day, 15 minute batches of posts are the most efficient way of placing them on the system. If they do not show up within this time frame, and they would not be classified as SPAM,  something is wrong, and we would appreciate it if you would let us know.<p>
If the article is directed to a newsgroup that has a moderator, it will be directed to the moderator for approval, before it is posted. When approved, it will propagated back to us through the news network, so they will not appear instantly. If the moderator does not approve the post, it may never be posted. We keep a <a href="http://www.zippo.com/list.htm">list</a> of moderated newsgroups.<p>
If your post was SPAM, it may never show up. Major commercial messages in non-commercial groups are screened, as are articles cross posted to many groups that are not of common interest. If you are not sure if a post is SPAM, as us<p>
<a name="a5">
<strong> I've seen posts on other news servers that don't show up on the Zippo Servers ?</strong>
All news servers are independent. There is not a central hub, or and originating point for all news. Each server also has it's own policies on what groups to carry, what to feed outbound to other news services, and where they will get inbound news from. Generally, because we have many inbound news feeds, we get the bulk of the news that is placed into general circulation. If you consistently see posts on another server, that you do not see on Super Zippo or Zippo, send us a copy of the post header and we'll see if we can track it down, or arrange for a feed from the source.<p>
<a name="a6">
<strong> Why does it take so long for articles to show up on Super Zippo, or Zippo, when they are posted on other news servers. ?</strong>
I think the misleading term is "news". I think it should be called publicly distributed mail. News is not like broadcast news. The news migrates amongst perhaps 10,000 significant servers and, depending where you are in the overall flow, articles will be received in a few hours, or a few days. You may see a post on a server that took three connections to get there and a few hours. The same post may have taken 9 connections to get to us and 4 days. The reverse will also be true, where articles appear on our servers, but do not appear on other servers. <p>
<a name="a7">
<strong>I use Agent to count new articles on news servers and sometimes Super Zippo and Zippo have less. ?</strong><p>
It would be very easy for us to match or exceed the number of articles on other large news servers. All we would have to do is open the flood gates to SPAM and prevent any external post cancellations. We'd rather not. On a daily bases we remove at least 4,000 posts of "Make Money Fast" , approximately 8,000 posts by the guys that advertise dial-aporn hotlines by putting their number on a picture from alt.binary.pictures.erotica.girlfriends, etc. We hope our net articles are more worthwhile and will encourage people to post, when they see their messages won't be lost in a pile of garbage. <p>
