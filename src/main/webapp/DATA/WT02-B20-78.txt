  Seven pitfalls of transition planning for students with disabilities are 
identified: (1) planning at an inappropriate level; (2) confusing means with 
ends; (3) failing to involve all relevant educational partners; (4) selecting 
programs before identifying goals; (5) failing to consider future community 
realities; (6) being unaware of the process elements of strategic planning; and 
(7) assuming all planning approaches are the same.  (DB)<BR>

  The Multi-District Outreach Projects for Services for Youths with 
Disabilities include 14 federally funded projects that assist in the adoption of 
proven models, components of models, or other exemplary practices.  The 
projects are designed to improve secondary education and transition services in 
areas such as continuing education, self-determination, vocational education 
and training, supported or competitive employment, leisure and recreation, or 
other aspects of independent living.  The projects are felt to serve a need for 
dissemination and replication of exemplary practices, as state and local 
education agencies work to implement federal transition services requirements 
and school-to-work opportunity requirements.  The 14 funded projects are 
described.  Outreach projects newly funded in 1994 focus on a self-
determination transition curriculum, transition planning for adolescents with 
serious emotional disturbance, employability assessment, natural supports in 
employment, collaboration transition teams, and a collaboration and networking 
project.  Expiring outreach projects addressed statewide transition inservice, 
a workshop series assisting families to prepare for the transition from school 
to adult life, various transition programs, and job training and work 
experience programs.  (Contains 13 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This policy update presents key aspects of the statutory language of the 
School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-239), which provides 
states and localities with federal funds to be used as venture capital to 
underwrite the initial costs of planning and establishing statewide School-to-
Work Opportunities systems.  The paper focuses on: (1) purpose of the Act; (2) 
program components, including general program requirements such as equal access 
and participation of youth with disabilities, followed by descriptions of the 
school-based learning component, the work-based learning component, and the 
connecting activities component; (3) school-to-work opportunities development 
and implementation grants to states; (4) grants to local partnerships; and (5) 
strategies for ensuring participation of youth with disabilities.  Potential 
implications for youth with disabilities are described.  The paper also 
analyzes the relationship between the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 
and the transition service requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act of 1990.  (JDD)<BR>

  Two problems confront the school-to-work (STW) transition initiative: the 
quality of STW transitions and the equity with which those experiences are 
distributed among different student groups, including those with disabilities.  
In the past, the goals of equity and quality seemed to conflict.  Many persons 
advocating increases in quality appeared to be unconcerned with equity and vice 
versa.  The following criteria for developing STW transitions in which equity 
and excellence coexist have been identified: (1) access to all; (2) 
individualization; (3) generic problem-solving; (4) community settings; and (5) 
guaranteed benefits (recognized and accepted credentials authorizing entry into 
career opportunities or postsecondary educatcation programs; placement or 
acceptance in postsecondary vocational and educational programs; placement in 
competitive or supported employment; and participation in continuing and adult 
education, adult servic and independent living in community settings).  
Studies have confirmed the positive effects that participation in vocational 
education and work experience programs have on the employment outcomes of 
secondary school students in special education.  The identified criteria for 
developing/evaluating STW programs for students with disabilities can be used 
to design equitable STW programs emphasizing community-based training and 
experience.  (Contains 15 references.) (MN)<BR>

  Four articles comprise this monograph on interventions which lead to 
employment of youths with disabilities.  Articles are based on investigations 
and demonstrations sponsored by the Office of Special Education and 
Rehabilitative Services (OSERS).  In "Promoting Employment for Youths in 
Transition: Outcomes, Activities, and Indicators," Paula D. Kohler and Frank R. 
Rusch present a model for systems change based on outcomes, activities, and 
indicators for promoting employment in this population.  The article presents 
an overview of the OSERS investigations leading to the model's development.  
The second article, "An Analysis of OSERS'-Sponsored Secondary Special Education 
and Transitional Services Research" (Frank Rusch et al.), contains the findings 
from an analysis of five federal funding competitions focusing on transition to 
work or postsecondary education, in an effort to identify quality indicators 
and outcomes.  In a further extension of this line of research, Frank Rusch et 
al. in "Employment Outcomes and Activities for Youths in Transition," 
identified 22 outcomes and 65 related activities associated with employment.  
Of these, OSERS project directors ranked the following as the most important 
outcomes: utilizing individualized education plans, educating students 
alongside their nondisabled peers, and documenting progress in employment-
related skill areas.  Finally, in "School-to-Work Transition: Identification of 
Employment Related Outcome and Activity Indicators," Paula Kohler and Rank 
Rusch identify measures to serve as indicators for each outcome and activity 
identified earlier by project directors.  The listing of outcome and activity 
indicators is appended.  Individual papers contain references.  (DB)<BR>
