<h1>Renewable Energy: Geothermal Energy</h1><p>
<p>
Geothermal energy is renewable heat energy from the Earth.  Geothermal
reservoirs of hot water or steam are tapped with wells, and their heat is

either used directly or converted to electricity.  Geothermal 
applications can
range in scale from small, residential heat pumps to large district 
heating
systems.<p>
<p>
<h2>Geothermal Electric Power: Current and Potential Use</h2>
The 45 geothermal power plants in the United States produce enough 
electricity
to power the homes of more than 3.5 million people--that's about how many

people live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. <p>

Geothermal power plants are very reliable and require minimal 
maintenance.  The
average geothermal plant operates 95% of the time, compared to 70% to 80% 
for
nuclear and coal-fired plants.<p>

The Geysers, a large steam reservoir north of San Francisco, is the 
largest
source of geothermal power in the world.  California obtains about 7% of 
its
electricity from geothermal power plants.<p>

The total amount of geothermal energy that could be exploited with 
today's
technology is estimated at 27 times more than energy used throughout the 
entire
country each year.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Economic Benefits of Geothermal Electric Power</h2>
Geothermal plants in the United States employ approximately 3700 people, 
with
electricity sales of about $1 billion per year.  A typical large 
geothermal
plant pays as much as $4.2 million annually in local property taxes.<p>

Today's geothermal plants produce power at a cost competitive with 
conventional
energy sources and ranging from $0.03 to $0.075 per kilowatt-hour.<p>

During the next 20 years, foreign countries are expected to spend $25 to
$40 billion constructing geothermal power plants, creating a significant
opportunity for U.S. suppliers of geothermal goods and services.  U.S. 
firms
recently announced contracts totaling approximately $4.5 billion to build

geothermal power plants in Indonesia and the Philippines.<p>

Royalties received by the U.S. government for geothermal leases are more 
than
$30 million annually.<p>
<p>
<h2>Environmental Benefits of Geothermal Electric Power</h2>
Geothermal power plants have very low air emissions.  Producing the same 
amount
of electricity, a typical geothermal power plant would emit no nitrous 
oxides,
only 1% of the sulfur dioxide, and only 5% of the carbon dioxide of a
coal-fired plant.<p>

Some geothermal power plant designs emit no carbon dioxide, which is a
greenhouse gas.  This makes geothermal power an ideal technology for 
helping to
minimize global climate change. <p>

In 1991, California's Lake County, home to many of the power plants at 
The
Geysers, became the first and only county to fully meet California's 
stringent
air quality regulations. Lake County received an award in 1992 and 1993 
for the
county with the cleanest air in California.<p>
<p>
<h2>Direct Use of Geothermal Energy: Current and Potential Use</h2>
Direct uses of geothermal heat include heating buildings and greenhouses,

pasteurizing milk, deicing roads, heating water in fish farms, 
dehydrating
foods, growing mushrooms, secondary oil recovering, and heating leaching
solutions at gold mines.  Such applications currently save the energy
equivalent of 2 million barrels of oil each year.<p>

The known geothermal hot water resources could produce enough energy to 
replace
1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas every year for 30 years.  This is
more than 60 times the amount of natural gas currently used each year.<p>


<h2>Geothermal Heat Pumps</h2>
Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) use the Earth as a heat source and sink.  
Their
high efficiency can cut annual home heating costs by as much as 50% and 
cut
cooling costs by 25%.  GHPs can be used throughout the country and are 
rapidly
gaining popularity in the Midwest and Northeast.<p>

GHPs are a major component of President Clinton's Climate Change Action 
Plan.
recently announced contracts totGHP installations are projected to exceed 
400,000 annually by the year 2000, up
from 40,000 units per year today. This would avoid the need to construct 
four
medium-size (300-MW) power plants each year.<p>
