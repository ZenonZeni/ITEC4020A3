<h2>How It All Works</h2>
<p><strong>Introducing Phosphorous</strong>

<p>The process of "doping" introduces an atom of another element into the silicon crystal to alter its
electrical properties.  The dopant has either three or five valence electrons, as opposed to
silicon's four.

<p>Phosphorus atoms, which have five valence electrons, are used for doping n-type silicon
(because phosphorous provides its fifth, free, electron).  A phosphorus atom occupies the same
place in the crystal lattice that was occupied formerly by the silicon atom it replaced.  Four of its
valence electrons take over the bonding responsibilities of the four silicon valence electrons that
they replaced.  But the fifth valence electron remains free, without bonding responsibilities. 
When numerous phosphorus atoms are substituted for silicon in a crystal, many free electrons
become available.

<br clear=all>
<p>The most common method of doping is to coat the top of a layer of silicon with phosphorus and
then heat the surface.  This allows the phosphorus atoms to diffuse into the silicon.  The
temperature is then lowered so that the rate of diffusion drops to zero.  Other methods of
introducing phosphorus into silicon include gaseous diffusion, a liquid dopant spray-on process,
and a technique in which phosphorus ions are driven precisely into the surface of the silicon.
