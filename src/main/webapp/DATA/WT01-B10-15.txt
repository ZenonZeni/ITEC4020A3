Nothing is quite as distressing as being &quot;different.&quot;
And not having your first period by the time you are sixteen (primary
amenorrhea) falls into this category, especially if you have not
developed breasts and pubic hair as your friends have. I'm told
that the girls' locker room can be just as intimidating as the
boys'.
<P>
However, delayed puberty is only one aspect of this menstrual
disorder. Many other factors ranging from anatomical abnormalities
to genetic defects can prevent the onset of menses.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>Categorizing Primary Amenorrhea</h2>

It's quite likely that if you have never menstruated, you've already
consulted with your physician about which of the four categories
of primary amenorrhea you fall into. You may, however, be unaware
of some of the new options you may have for bearing your &quot;own&quot;
child. The road to your &quot;happy ending&quot; will depend on
which of the four categories you fall into:
<OL>
<LI><I>Women who have a normal uterus and ovaries: </I>If your
reproductive organs are normal, you have a hormonal problem which
developed prior to your going through puberty: empty sella syndrome,
pituitary tumor, adrenal tumor, polycystic ovarian disease, and
so forth.<p> In some rare cases your problem may stem from an anatomical
abnormality: you may have been born with an imperforate hymen
(closed vagina); with cervical stenosis (closed cervix) or without a vagina. These
problems affect about 40 percent of women with primary amenorrhea.
<LI><i>Women who have a normal uterus with nonfunctional ovaries:</i>
You may have a normal uterus, but have ovaries that do not contain
any eggs (germinal cells). These problems affect about 30 percent
of women with primary amenorrhea.
<LI><I>Women who have a nonfunctional uterus with functional ovaries:</I>
You may have normal ovaries and a nonfunctional uterus. These
problems affect about 20 percent of women with primary amenorrhea.
<LI><i>Women who have no uterus and no ovaries:</i> You may have no ovaries
and no uterus. These problems affect about 10 percent of women
with primary amenorrhea.</OL><p>

<H2 align=center>Treatment Options for Women with Primary Amenorrhea</H2>


<B>Normal Uterus and Ovaries</B> <br>
If your reproductive organs are normal, but hormonal problems
are keeping you from menstruating, the treatments for hormonal
imbalances outlined in <a href="ch12mb.html">chapter 12</a> will probably restore your fertility.
Should your hymen or cervix be closed to the outside, a minor
surgical procedure will open them to allow menstrual flow. If you were born without a vagina but have a normal uterus, hysterectomy will usually be necessary to prevent a painful buildup of menstrual blood that can destroy the uterus.  Your ovaries will not be removed and will enable you to  use in
vitro techniques to harvest your eggs and fertilize them
with your husband's sperm. Pre-embryos will then be transferred to a gestational surrogate
who can carry the pregnancy. 
<P>
<p>
<B>Normal Uterus with Nonfunctional Ovaries (No Eggs)</B> <br>
If you have a normal uterus and nonfunctional ovaries, your FSH
will be elevated, indicating that your pituitary is working overtime
to stimulate follicular development. This may be because you were
born without any eggs (Turner's syndrome) or because, due to an
enzyme defect, your ovary cannot respond to FSH stimulation (resistant
ovary syndrome). I can confirm that you have a normal uterus with
an X ray (Hysterosalpingogram).
<P>
Even though your chance for having a baby seems hopeless, studies
indicate that with the proper hormonal supplement, you should be
able to nurture a donor embryo in your womb.
<P>
Joe and Toni H. decided to use donor eggs to achieve a pregnancy.
They used Joe's sperm to fertilize the eggs retrieved from a donor 
who remained anonymous. I transferred three embryos
to Toni's uterus after providing the necessary hormones. After a few weeks of pregnancy, her placenta provided all the necessary hormones. You may wish to read more about donor embryo transfers in <a href="ch21mb.html">chapter
21</a>.
<P>
<B>Nonfunctional Uterus with Functional Ovaries</B> <br>

If you have normally functioning ovaries, you can have your own
baby. One particular couple comes to mind: Gary and Bridgette
D. Although her ovaries were perfectly normal, Bridgette's uterus
had not developed properly.  Gary and Bridgette decided travelled to Pennsylvania to undergo in vitro fertilization. Her sister agreed to carry the pregnancy and had three of the pre-embryos transferred to her uterus. Three weeks after the second try, they received
a call telling them that they had made a miracle baby.
<P>
With in vitro fertilization techniques a doctor can surgically
retrieve (harvest) your eggs, mix them in a petri dish (in vitro)
with your husband's sperm, and transfer your living embryo to
a surrogate mother's womb for gestation. Nine months later you
can take home your own baby for a lifetime of joy.
<P>
Although these medical techniques are feasible today, many unanswered
legal and ethical questions have been preventing widespread use.
I suggest you read <a href="ch21mb.html">chapter 21</a> for the legal and moral issues associated
with embryo transfers and surrogate mothers.
<P>
<b>Uterus and Ovaries Absent</b><br>

If you have no uterus and no ovaries, you have several options
for having a child. You cannot have a child genetically related
to you, because you have no eggs to pass on your genes. A surrogate
mother, however, can offer you the opportunity for having a baby
who is genetically related to your husband. Using artificial insemination
techniques, your husband can father the child and you can adopt
it from the surrogate mother. If you are interested in pursuing
this type of arrangement, I suggest you read the information on
surrogate mothers in <a href="ch21mb.html">chapter 21</a>.
<P>
Another option you may wish to consider is <a href="http://www.gems.com/adoption/others.html">adoption</a>. Once they
receive their &quot;chosen&quot; baby, many couples who suffer
through years of unsuccessful infertility treatment often wonder
why they waited so long before choosing adoption. Adoption can
be a very satisfying happy ending.
<P>
Most women with primary amenorrhea can be helped. Women with hormonal
imbalances can have them corrected; women with eggs and no uterus
can &quot;hire&quot; a gestational surrogate;  women with a womb and no
eggs can give birth using donor oocytes; and women with no reproductive
organs can consider a surrogate mother relationship. With the
aid of &quot;miracle medicine,&quot; nearly all of the women with
primary amenorrhea can look forward to a happy ending.
