 <B><I> Is there a listing of what are considered to be the *best practices*
 or models for teaching the gifted?

</B></I><P>A list of best practices does not exist at this time.  When attempts are
made to evaluate the impact of a particular school environment, such as the resource
room (Vaughn, Feldhusen, & Asher, 1991), or ability grouping, or a particular
instructional method such as creative problem solving, the range and diversity of results
is impressive. It is clear that resource rooms work well sometimes, and not at all well at
others. The enrichment triad is a great success in some places and a disappointment in
others. Merely placing youngsters in a particular setting, or providing them with a
particular set of activities, does not necessarily lead to success.<P>
On the other hand, a well-constructed program that brings gifted students
together and provides them with an intellectually stimulating and important set
of ideas, together with giving them practice to use their own ability to
problem-find and problem-solve, seems to yield very tangible results (Gallagher,
1993).<P>
Changing the learning environment without changing the content of lessons seems
nonproductive and leads many gifted students to say that "school is boring."
Further, much of the curriculum that is designed with gifted students in mind is
designed on an "ad hoc" basis, without benefit of scope and sequence, and with
little apparent justification.  Regarding curriculum issues, please see
VanTassel-Baska, J. (1992)  "Planning Effective Curriculum for Gifted Learners."

This book provides a comprehensive review of teaching-learning models used in
the development and implementation of a curriculum for gifted students.  The
models described were selected for their demonstrated or potential success with
gifted children and their widespread use.  For each model, the following types
of information are provided: assumptions underlying the model, elements of the
model, modification of the basic curriculum, modifying the approach, model
development, research on effectiveness, advantages and disadvantages, and
references.  Following an introductory chapter, nine chapters cover the
following models: (1) George Betts--the autonomous learner model; (2) Benjamin
Bloom and David Krathwohl--the cognitive and affective taxonomies; (3) Jerome
Bruner--the basic structure of a discipline; (4) Sidney Parnes--creative
problem solving; (5) Joseph S. Renzulli--the enrichment triad; (6) Shlomo and
Yael Sharan--group investigations; (7) Hilda Taba--teaching strategies program;
(8) Calvin Taylor--multiple talent approach; and (9) Donald J. Treffinger--self-
directed learning.  In addition, five other approaches are briefly described:
J. P. Guilford--the structure of intellect; Lawrence Kohlberg--discussions of
moral dilemmas; Frank E. Williams--teaching strategies for thinking and
feeling; problem-based learning; and thinking actively in a social context.  The
final chapter offers guidelines for developing a comprehensive approach to
gifted education curricula.  (Individual chapters contain references.) (DB)<BR>

This paper introduces the Learning Outcomes Study at the University of
Virginia, an ongoing 2-year investigation of over 1,000 elementary school
children who entered one of 16 different gifted programs (or no program) in the
fall of 1990.  The study will compare effects of four examples each of four
types of program delivery arrangements: (1) within-classroom (or mainstream
type); (2) pull-out programs; (3) separate classes or ability tracking; (4) and
special schools.  Special comparisons will be made of program effects on
minority and disadvantaged students.  Information will also be collected on
each program's curriculum, teaching methods and goals, as well as the
background and training of program teachers, and student identification
criteria.  Students will be assessed four times: at the time of entry into a
formal gifted program, at the end of their first year in the program, and at
the beginning and end of their second year.  Multiple outcome measures will
assess student achievement, attitudes, and adjustment.  Additional questions
possibly examined include the relationship between self-concept and intrinsic
motivation; whether these two concepts have a differential impact on
achievement; and the behavioral adjustment of high achieving students.  (18

This book on effective curriculum for gifted students begins with an
introduction that discusses gifted education's use of the special education
model and implications of current educational reform.  Part 1, "General Issues
in the Design and Development of Appropriate Curricula for the Gifted," then
explores scope and sequence in curricula for the gifted, correspondence between
gifted learner characteristics and curricula, philosophy and goals for a gifted
program, gifted learner outcomes, teaching-learning activities and resources,
instructional strategies and management techniques, assessing and evaluating
curricula, and implementing a curriculum for gifted learners.  Part 2,
"Specific Considerations in Planning Curricula for Special Populations of
Gifted Learners," notes such special populations as disadvantaged gifted,
underachievers, gifted girls, and gifted students with disabilities.  This part
then examines methods of identifying and nurturing disadvantaged gifted
students and learning-disabled gifted students, and offers an individualized
plan for a learning-disabled gifted female.  Part 2 also contains four chapters
written by other authors: "A Perspective on Curriculum Development for Gifted
Learners" (Gail McEachron-Hirsch); "Curricula for Exceptional Children: A
Special Education Perspective" (Virginia Laycock); "Gifted Children with
Specific Learning Disabilities" (Lori Korinek); and "Bridging Family and
School: A School Psychologist Perspective" (Agnes Donovan).  The appendix
contains sample curriculum units, as follows: tessellations unit (fifth grade),
marvelous machines (fifth grade), the unexpected (eighth grade), exponential
and logarithmic functions (high school), a scientist's history of the world
(fourth to sixth grades), and investigating weather folklore (fourth grade).  (JDD)<BR>

This monograph describes the development of a scope and sequence model for
science education specifically intended for use with gifted students in grades
K-8.  Introductory material notes the rationale and purpose of the model as
well as its functions such as providing a scaffolding linking educational
concepts with the technology of school curriculum.  The three stages of the 21-
month project are outlined.  Instructional emphases of the curriculum are: (1)
scientific habits of mind; (2) critical/productive thinking skills; and (3)
metacognitive skills.  Ways to further differentiate the curriculum are
suggested, such as varying the level of the outcome and varying the
sophistication of the content.  Desired outcomes are grouped into generic
concept outcomes and scientific process outcomes with associated assessment
indicators.  Specific outcomes are listed by approximate grade level for
concepts; content applications (in biology, earth science, physical science);
interdisciplinary applications (social systems, number systems, cities as
systems, language, political systems, economic systems); the scientific
process; problem-based learning; technology (computer, camera, and calculator
skills); scientific habits of mind (stressing curiosity, creativity,
objectivity, openness to new ideas, and skepticism); critical/productive
thinking skills; and metacognitive strategies (planning, monitoring, assessing).
Guidelines for using the model for unit development are also offered.  (DB)<BR>

This paper highlights three models for implementing local restructuring of
schools: James Comer's School Development Program; Robert Slavin's Success for
All; and Henry Levin's Accelerated Schools.  These have been among the more
popular models for restructuring schools in poor, predominantly minority
neighborhoods with traditionally low-achieving students.  Separate sections
describe and analyze each of these programs individually.  Further sections
address important issues and themes common to all the programs.  One of these
sections discusses evaluation and assessment issues of both programs and
students.  A further section looks at the three models from the viewpoint of
traditional assessments.  A discussion of what causes improvements in learning
notes that: Comer's model is based on healing conflicts and creating an ethos
that fosters identification and bonding and a community of trust; Slavin's model
is more heavily cognitive; and Levin's format calls for active, intelligent
participation of all members.  Final sections review resources and costs for the
various programs, and efforts at replication.  An author bibliography is
included.<BR>

The Accelerated School Program is designed to improve the education of
disadvantaged students by using "acceleration" techniques used with gifted and
talented students.  The goal is to speed up the learning of at-risk students so
they will be able to perform at grade level by the end of elementary school. 
Central to the strategy is the placement of curriculum and instructional
decisions in the hands of the instructional staff, requiring a complete
restructuring of the traditional school organization.  The emphasis on local
responsibility for educational outcomes requires an appropriate decision-
structure built around the school's unity of purpose.  The school must also
develop the capacity to identify challenges, to understand these challenges,
and to implement and evaluate solutions.  Fifty schools nationwide have begun
the six-year process needed to implement the accelerated school program.  Cost
estimates average about $1,000 per pupil per year.  Although many issues
regarding curriculum development, changing staff roles, and developing parent
participation will require further exploration, the Accelerated Schools Model
offers hope for closing the educational gap between America and other
countries, and between the disadvantaged and the advantaged.  Comments by T. P.
Fitzgerald, Frances Kemmerer, and Steven D. Gold and a response by the
presenter are included.  (FMW)<BR>

Examining the question, "Why are children not mastering what they ought to be
learning in school?," this book merges cognitive science with educational
agenda to show how incompatible children's minds and natural patterns of
learning are to current educational materials, practices, and institutions,
making a case for restructuring the schools.  The chapters in the book are
divided into three parts.  The first part examines the characteristics of the
"natural" learner.  The second part explores the characteristics of educational
institutions, and the third part presents a reconceptualization of education
for the purpose of understanding.  The chapters are: (1) "Conceptualizing the
Development of the Mind"; (2) "Initial Learnings: Constraints and
Possibilities"; (3) "Knowing the World through Symbols"; (4) "The Worlds of the
Preschooler: The Emergence of Intuitive Understandings"; (5) "The Values and
Traditions of Education"; (6) "The Institution Called School"; (7) The

A meta-analysis was conducted on nine experimental studies dealing with pull-
out programs for gifted students in grades one through nine.  Results indicate
that pull-out programs in gifted education have significant positive effects on
achievement, critical thinking, and creativity, but not on student self-concept.

The article discusses the use of the Structure of Intellect (SOI) model as a
basis for developing thinking abilities in a variety of curriculum areas: (1)
the integration of subject matter areas and SOI operations; (2) thematic
lessons that sequence specific cells of the SOI model; (3) directed teaching
lessons to develop student awareness of their own thinking processes; (4)
strategies that foster student attitudes conducive to the use of divergent
thinking; and (5) application of SOI-based thinking abilities to problem
solving.  Sample curriculum activities are included as illustrations.  (Author/JW)<BR>

This updated 1987 article argues that teaching of thinking skills, common in
gifted education, has wider value in regular school instructional programs.  It
describes programs which have implemented Talents Unlimited, a classroom-level,
research-based model for teaching creative- and critical-thinking skills which
encompasses productive thinking, decision making, planning, forecasting, and
communication.  (VW)<BR>
