<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>My name is Jerry Berman. I am Executive Director
of the Center for Democracy and Technology. The Center is pleased
to have this opportunity to address the subcommittee on one of
the critical civil liberties issues of our day: the question of
privacy in the new communications media, specifically wireless
communications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is
an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization
in Washington, DC. The Center's mission is to develop and implement
public policies to protect and advance individual liberty and
democratic values in new digital media. The Center achieves its
goals through policy development, public education, and coalition
building.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The Center coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security
Working Group, a diverse coalition of over 50 computer, communications,
and public interest organizations working to develop and implement
policies that protect personal privacy and network security on
the expanding and rapidly changing global information infrastructure.
DPSWG originally came into being in 1984 - 1986, when Congress
undertook a major review of the federal wiretap laws in order
to bring them up to date with advances in technology, including
the emergence of wireless communications. DPSWG played a critical
role in the enactment of the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986 (&quot;ECPA&quot;). Since then, DPSWG has been involved
extensively in the on-going debate over government control of
encryption and in the crafting in 1994 of narrowly tailored legislation
to preserve law enforcement access to communications while strengthening
public accountability mechanisms and privacy protections, the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (&quot;CALEA&quot;).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Presently, in the belief that the privacy protection
laws require periodic review in light of the changing uses of
technology, DPSWG is undertaking a major new study of communications
privacy, focusing on the effectiveness and coverage of ECPA, implementation
of CALEA, the potential of strong encryption technology to protect
privacy and security and prevent crime, and other issues. Our
study will be completed later this year, but I will share with
you today some of our tentative conclusions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Finally, I should note that one of CDT's priorities
has been the promotion of online democracy. CDT is seeking new
ways to give Internet users greater access to government and opportunities
to participate in the democratic process. To that end, CDT produced
the first live cybercast of a congressional hearing which featured
realtime interaction between committee members and Internet users.
CDT is the coordinator of the Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory
Committee, which is working with the Caucus to educate the Congress
about the Internet and to expand citizen access to Congress via
the Internet. In that regard, we were particularly pleased to
see that the Commerce Committee is obtaining testimony in electronic
form and posting it on the Committee Website. We congratulate
the Committee on this initiative.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> </FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="point1"><B><FONT SIZE=4>I. Ongoing developments in telecommunications
increase the urgency of ensuring the privacy and security of wireless
communications.</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>For all the benefits conferred by advancements in
communications technology, the American public is deeply concerned
that such advancements also threaten to overwhelm the cherished
right of privacy. The threats arise from both governmental and
private surveillance. Accordingly, for the past thirty years,
Congress has recognized that it must ensure that the laws protecting
privacy keep pace with the changing uses of technology. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>From 1968 when it first enacted the wiretap law known
as Title III, through enactment of the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act (&quot;ECPA&quot;) in 1986, to the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (&quot;CALEA&quot;),
Congress has sought to balance three goals: (1) to provide strong
legal protections for electronic communications, (2) to afford
law enforcement a carefully limited authority to carry out electronic
surveillance in serious cases, and (3) to encourage the development
and widespread availability of new technologies. ECPA, for example,
by extending clear privacy protections to e-mail and cellular
telephone conversations, gave an important degree of credibility
to those communications media when they were in their infancy,
contributing to the dramatic growth they have both undergone.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>When it enacted ECPA, Congress knew that it would
have to return to the law of communications privacy periodically,
as technology continued changing. In that regard, some privacy
enhancements were made in CALEA. Now, due to a series of developments,
we are at another juncture that requires a major, careful examination
of the adequacy of privacy protection legislation. Some of these
developments have occurred in the realm of wireless communications:
Cellular telephones have become commonplace and are now widely
used by ordinary citizens. Moreover, wireless transmission is
no longer important only for voice communication, but is becoming
increasingly important for data transfer and as the gateway to
the global information infrastructure. The Internet has developed
since 1986 in ways that the drafters of ECPA never imagined. Telecommunications
are becoming increasingly integrated, increasingly global, and
increasingly decentralized. These developments, which are central
to the ongoing communications revolution, heighten the urgency
of ensuring the privacy and security of wireless communications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In the network of networks that comprise the telecommunications
&quot;system&quot; of today and the future, it is no longer appropriate
to look at the cellular telephone system as distinct from the
wireline system or to look at the telephone system as separate
from the Internet. We are seeing a merger of voice, data, and
visual communication, carried interoperably over both wireless
and wireline means. This integrated network serves a range of
commercial, educational, social and political functions. The Internet
is a marketplace, a library, a movie theater, a town hall, a social
meeting place. Its potential would be stifled equally by excessive
government regulation or inadequate privacy and security.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>This network knows no national boundaries. Indeed,
one of the strengths of the Internet, and one of the ways in which
it fosters democratic values, is the ease with which it spans
the globe. Information flows as effortlessly from New York to
Nairobi as from Washington DC to West Virginia. Moreover, a communication
from New York to Nairobi may travel through the United Kingdom
and four other countries one day, but through France and five
different countries the next day.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>For this reason, it has been said that, on the Internet,
the Bill of Rights is a local ordinance. This means that the protections
of the US. Constitution offer little privacy assurance to US citizens
whose Internet communications regularly cross international borders.
Foreign governments can intercept these messages without the knowledge
of the senders, and beyond the ability of the US government to
protect the privacy of its citizens. Indeed, the US government
itself is not bound by requirements of our wiretapping laws when
eavesdropping on US citizens from points abroad. The legal scheme
of the wiretap laws, as amended by ECPA, should be expanded so
that the US government is subject to the court order requirements
of the wiretap laws when engaging abroad in surveillance of US
citizens for criminal investigative purposes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>With the breakup of telecommunications monopolies,
the entry of many new service providers, and the widespread availability
of computer technology in the hands of individuals, control over
telecommunications technology has become increasingly decentralized.
The Internet epitomizes the drive towards decentralization in
communications technology. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="point2"><B><FONT SIZE=4>II. The privacy of wireless communications
is entitled to strong legal protection.</FONT></B></A><FONT SIZE=4>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In this context of a global communications network
increasingly dependent on wireless links, we are able to see how
it is a serious invasion of privacy to eavesdrop on cellular telephone
conversations. Cellular eavesdroppers are invading the privacy
not only of the person who is using a cellular phone, but also
of anybody else who is on the conversation using an ordinary landline
telephone. As cellular telephones become more ubiquitous, cellular
scanning threatens the privacy of all telephone users. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Given the growth of wireless services, it is clear
that Congress made the right decision in 1986 when it determined
that intentionally intercepting cellular phone conversations should
be a federal crime. Congress clearly has the authority to protect
communications transmitted over the airwaves, and it did so with
respect to cellular telephone conversations in ECPA, extending
to the then-fledgling cellular telephone industry the same privacy
protections that had applied to traditional wireline services.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>ECPA also made it a crime to manufacture, sell, assemble,
possess or advertise any device that is &quot;primarily useful&quot;
for the interception of wireless telephone conversations. We know
that manufacturers, retailers and individuals have taken a very
narrow view of this law, and consequently scanners are widely
available still that intercept cellular telephones. We believe
that the Congress should take a serious look at closing the ambiguities
in the scanner law. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="point3"><B><FONT SIZE=4>III. The privacy of wireless
communications goes beyond voice, to the growing area of data
communications.</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>It would be a mistake, however, to limit consideration
of wireless communications privacy to voice conversations only,
for wireless is becoming increasingly important for data communications.
Wireless modems, wireless faxes, and wireless local area networks
are linking computers and transferring data that could include
proprietary information, medical records, and financial data.
Wireless links are becoming more and more important as access
points to the global information network. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>It is not clear, however, that ECPA clearly protects
wireless transfers of data. An earlier industry and privacy task
force concluded in 1991 that wireless transfers of data were not
covered by ECPA. In 1994, in CALEA and with the support of the
Administration, Congress passed a provision making it clear that
the privacy of wireless data transfers was protected by ECPA.
But less than two years later, in the anti-terrorism act of 1996,
Congress repealed the provision. Pub. L. 104-132, section 731.<SUP><A HREF="#foot1">1</A></SUP>
At a time when wireless local area networks are proliferating
and wireless data transmissions could be used for everything from
proprietary data to medical records, the law should be perfectly
clear that wireless data transfers are protected by statute to
the same extent as wireless voice communications.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="point4"><B><FONT SIZE=4>IV. While legal protections are
important, they are not enough to ensure privacy. Privacy and
security must be ensured through technical means, which the marketplace
is developing.</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>As the recent incident involving the Speaker of the
House demonstrates, statutory prohibitions against the interception
of cellular phone conversations are not enough. The fact is that
devices are still manufactured and marketed that are capable of
intercepting cellular telephones, or that can be readily modified
to do so, and there are individuals who think it is fun to listen
in on other people's cellular telephone conversations. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Again, though, we are here to stress a broader point:
The integrated, global, decentralized communications network is
vulnerable to threats that make the interception of the Speaker's
telephone conversation pale by comparison. The nation's banking
system and its financial markets are totally dependent on the
public switched telecommunications network. So is the air traffic
control system. So is the United States military. As the National
Research Council recently concluded, </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;The fundamental characteristic of the PSTN
[public switched telecommunications network] from the standpoint
of information vulnerability is that it is a highly interconnected
network of heterogeneously controlled and operated computer-based
switches. Network connectivity implies that an attacker -- which
might range from a foreign government to a teen-aged hacker --
can in principle connect to any network site (including sites
of critical importance for the entire network) from any other
network site (which may be geographically remote or even outside
the United States).&quot; Computer Science and Telecommunications
Board, National Research Council, Cryptography's Role in Securing
the Information Society, p. 34 (1996). </FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The vulnerabilities of unencrypted computer files
and electronic communications are well-documented. Unencrypted
communications are open to criminal exploitation, and the losses
to date from inadequate system security are enormous. In one series
of transactions in 1994, an international group of criminals penetrated
Citicorp's computerized electronic transfer system and moved about
$12 million from legitimate customer accounts into their own accounts
in banks around the world. The National Research Council recently
concluded: &quot;Of all the information vulnerabilities facing
US. companies internationally, electronic vulnerabilities appear
to be the most significant.&quot; <U>Ibid.</U></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Wireless communications should not be -- and need
not be -- the weak link in the integrated communications infrastructure.
Strong encryption offers opportunities for enhanced security in
the digital age. Widespread use of encryption to protect communications
will prevent fraud and other extremely dangerous forms of crime.
At the same time, encryption poses challenges to law enforcement
agencies. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The current debate over control of encryption technology
is in some ways a conflict between two competing models of security,
one in which private individuals, businesses and government choose
from a variety of encryption options to protect their security,
and one in which the government assumes primary responsibility
for protecting personal and business as well as governmental security
through government-mandated weaknesses in encryption technology.
It has become clear to us that the centralized approach to security
based on government-controlled encryption weaknesses will not
work in the decentralized, competitive, globalized environment
where the dynamics of decreasing cost and increasing computing
power have put more control and more choices in the hands of end
users. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Given these developments, there is no answer to the
encryption issue that will guarantee the government access in
all cases. Total prohibition is not an option. Strong non-escrowed
encryption is and will continue to be available to those most
committed to protecting communications, whether for legitimate
or illegal purposes. There are currently hundreds of encryption
products available worldwide. Other approaches that depend upon
aggressive government regulation are also not viable. Government
key escrow poses a level of vulnerability that is unacceptable
to business and individual users, and in any event non-escrowed
encryption will always be available to the committed wrongdoers.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>While it is clear that most businesses and individuals
will not trust the government to hold their keys, it is also becoming
increasingly clear that most encryption users, even the most sophisticated,
need to be able to deal with a simple problem: if they forget
or lose their own key, how do they recover their encrypted data?
Addressing this problem -- responding to user needs -- has resulted
in the development of a range of &quot;key escrow,&quot; &quot;key
recovery,&quot; or &quot;trusted third party&quot; systems. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Privacy concerns about key escrow systems have prompted
the Center for Democracy and Technology to undertake a study of
key escrow. Participants in this ongoing study include the world's
leading authorities in cryptography and computer security. The
purpose of the study is to examine the policy and operational
aspects of evolving key escrow or key management systems in terms
of technical security, privacy, engineering economics, and law
enforcement goals. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="point5"><B><FONT SIZE=4>V. CALEA implementation poses
concerns for privacy, security and cost.</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Do new technologies increase or decrease the vulnerability
of electronic communications to interception? The answer is both.
In recognition of the difficulties posed to law enforcement by
new technologies and market structures, Congress enacted the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which requires telecommunications
common carriers to ensure that their systems can satisfy law enforcement
electronic surveillance requests. CALEA was intended to preserve
the status quo with respect to law enforcement wiretapping abilities.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Implementation of CALEA poses serious questions.
The first set of issues concern the capability requirements which
are still being debated within industry forums and negotiated
in sessions between industry and law enforcement. In contravention
of Congress' clear intent, the FBI has argued that CALEA requires
cellular telephone companies to design into their systems the
capability to physically track cellular telephone users. The FBI
is seeking to go beyond either preserving the status quo or taking
advantage of enhancements in surveillance capability brought about
by new technologies. Instead, the FBI is seeking to mandate the
design of the infrastructure to expand the government's reach,
which is something Congress rejected. In the same vein, the FBI
is also pushing carriers for expanded availability of signaling
data, an increasingly rich source of personally revealing data.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Another set of CALEA issues concern surveillance
capacity. On January 14, 1997, the FBI issued a proposed notice
of capacity requirements, setting forth projected levels of wireline
and wireless telephone system capacity that law enforcement agencies
may need in the future. The notice supersedes a highly controversial
notice issued by the FBI in October 1995.<SUP><A HREF="#foot2" >2</A></SUP>
The latest notice is subject to a 30-day public comment period.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Read narrowly, the latest notice requires carriers
to install a surveillance capacity that is consistent with historic
patterns of law enforcement surveillance activity. However, if
read a certain way, this notice would establish huge requirements,
inconsistent with historic patterns of surveillance activity and
perhaps exceeding even the levels in the FBI's earlier, widely
criticized capacity notice. Unfortunately, the FBI has done nothing
yet to dispel the broader interpretations of the second notice,
and in fact has indicated informally that companies must be prepared
to meet the more extensive requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>When it finalizes the capacity notice after the 30-day
comment period, the FBI should make it clear that county-wide
surveillance requirements need not be applied to every switch
in a county, but rather are to be applied in light of (1) the
market share of the carrier; (2) historic trends of surveillance
within a county; (3) any advances in technology that reduce the
burden of carrying out electronic surveillance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="point6"><B><FONT SIZE=4>VI. CALEA mandated network security
and privacy, and Congress should hold the FCC to the fulfillment
of its responsibilities.</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Congress was concerned to ensure that the changes
made to accommodate law enforcement interception in compliance
with CALEA did not increase system vulnerability. Therefore, CALEA
included several important security provisions. One is section
105, entitled &quot;Systems Security and Integrity.&quot; In this
provision, for the first time ever, Congress mandated that telecommunications
companies &quot;shall ensure&quot; that interceptions within their
switching systems can occur only upon the affirmative intervention
of an individual officer of or employee of the carrier. Section
103(a)(4) of CALEA requires companies to ensure that systems are
designed &quot;In a manner that protects the privacy and security
of communications ... not authorized to be intercepted. Finally,
section 301 of CALEA requires the Federal Communications Commission
to issue regulations governing system security. We urge the Committee
to ensure that the FCC is carrying out these provisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="point7"><B><FONT SIZE=4>VII. The FCC should exercise
its authority to ensure the promotion of telecommunications system
security.</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Concerns with network security go beyond CALEA. The
FCC has both the authority and the responsibility under section
1 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 151 to ensure the security
and reliability of the nation's communications networks. In the
past, this Subcommittee has paid particular attention to reliability
concerns in the public switched telephone network. In an increasingly
decentralized and complex system, full attention to network security
issues requires a broad look at the network security features
available to users, including flexible and robust encryption.
We urge the Subcommittee to work with the Commission on this pressing
concern.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="conc"><B><FONT SIZE=4>Conclusions</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Congress should assure that current laws adequately
protect privacy in light of ongoing developments in telecommunications
technology. Wireless data transfers should be brought explicitly
within ECPA. The international implications of global communications
privacy should be addressed. A new encryption policy should be
developed that defers to user-driven solutions. The Subcommittee
should examine the FCC's oversight of network security and its
response to the network security provisions of CALEA.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>We would be happy to work with the Subcommittee to
accomplish these goals.<BR>

The repeal came at the behest of the Justice Department, which
argued that the privacy provision was inappropriately overbroad,
and included ham radio and CB radio broadcasts, which should not
be privacy-protected.  The Justice Department, reversing the Administration's
earlier provision, argued that wireless data transfers were already
protected.  Rather than propose narrower  language to make that
clear, the Administration successfully argued for repeal of the
entire provision.  In the context of the many issues in the terrorism
bill, this one received little attention.  </FONT>
