<BR>
8:30 A.M. EASTERN STANDARD TIME, THE FIRST FRIDAY OF EVERY MONTH: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the Labor Department, releases an <A HREF="ftp://STATS.bls.gov/pub/news.release/empsit.txt">employment situation report</A> that regularly influences the behavior of both the bond and equity markets in which mutual funds invest.
<P>
Using the data included in the report -- the unemployment rate, the size of nonfarm payrolls, average workweek and hourly earnings -- investors, economists and others make additional estimates about other aspects of the economy for which data are not yet available. These computations take place almost instantaneously and, within 15 minutes of the release of the report, the bond markets react to what the "news" is saying abut the economy.  By the time the stock markets open, within the hour, equity investors' reaction also will be apparent.
<P>
With the help of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. Chief Economist John Silvia, we've prepared a quick review of how information can be derived from the employment conditions report. 
<P>
December 6, 1996: THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION FOR NOVEMBER 1996<BR>
<I>For more information about any one of these economic measures, just click on the gear or read below.</I>


<P>

<IMG WIDTH=435 HEIGHT=300 BORDER=0 SRC="howmarkets/gifs/howmarkets_anim.gif" USEMAP="#howmarketsreact.map">
<P>

<B>Unemployment rate</B><BR>
Economists believe that the unemployment rate associated with "full employment" is 6 percent -- when fewer than 6 percent of the population is unemployed, wages tend to rise as employers bid for scarce labor.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 5.4%<BR>Change: +0.2</B>
<P>

<B>The number of people employed</B><BR>
The number of people employed is a measure of the economy's strength.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 120 million<BR>Change: +118,000</B>
<P>

<B>Consumer confidence</B> <I>(measured by the University of Michigan index)</I><BR>
Confidence tends to rise and fall with employment news.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 98.9<BR>Change: +2.4%</B>
<P>

<B>Where people are employed</B><BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>Manufacturing<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 18.2 million<BR>Change: +9,000</B>
<LI>Construction<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 5.4 million<BR>Change: +14,000</B>
<LI>Services<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 96.0 million<BR>Change: +96,000</B>
<LI>Government<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 19.5 million<BR>Change: -22,000</B>
</UL>
Detail on the sectors that are hiring is especially important to the stock markets.
 
<P>
<B>Tax revenue</B><BR>
The employment level will affect the amount of revenue to be generated by income taxes.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $918 billion<BR>Change: +0.6%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Hours worked</B><BR>
An increase in the average hours worked in a week can indicate a business upturn -- employers usually extend the number of hours their current employees work as a prelude to hiring more.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 34.5 / week<BR>Change: +0.2%</B>
<P>

<B>Industrial production</B> <I>(measured by an index)</I><BR>
Actual production figures are available later in the month, but early insights can be gained by reviewing the number of hours worked in the manufacturing sector.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 1.23<BR>Change: +0.4%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Capacity utilization</B><BR>
This rate, the subject of its own report later in the month, seeks to measure the operating capacity of factories. At full capacity -- generally believed to be around 82 percent -- inflation has historically tended to rise.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 83.4%<BR>Change: +0.2%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>How much workers are paid</B><BR>
With the total number of workers known, the next logical question is "How much are they being paid?" -- and do these hourly earnings represent an increase or a decrease?<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $413.66 / week<BR>Change: +$5.49</B>
<P>

<B>Personal income</B><BR>
The level of earnings will determine the amount that people have to spend on necessities and luxuries.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $6.6 trillion<BR>Change: +0.4%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Consumer spending</B><BR>
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the United States' gross domestic product (GDP). Once employment totals are known, market observers can make some educated guesses about income and consumption.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $5.6 trillion<BR>Change: +0.5%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Retail sales</B><BR>
Strong retail sales, including auto sales, can contribute to corporate profits, which pleases stock market investors. Bond market investors worry that strong sales can lead to an inflationary economy.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: $214 billion<BR>Change: +0.4%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Housing starts</B><BR>
When growth is anticipated, builders make more plans. Economic weakness or higher interest rates discourage building plans.<BR>
<B>November 1996 level: 1.46 million<BR>Change: -2.0%</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Gross domestic product (GDP)</B><BR>
Market observers track the change in gross domestic product (GDP) -- the dollar value of all goods and services produced in the United States -- as a measure of how fast the economy is growing. The Federal Reserve Board says it considers 2.5 percent to 3 percent an acceptable, noninflationary growth rate. Official GDP numbers are released and revised continually, but the employment conditions report makes it possible to do a quick calculation: Multiplying the number of people working X the average hours worked has produced a rough GDP that has historically been quite close to the GDP data released weeks and months later.<BR>
<B>September 1996 level: $6.9 trillion<BR>Change: +2.0% 3rd quarter</B> (estimate)
<P>

<B>Federal Reserve Board policy</B><BR>
Based on the rough GDP and inflation data that's derived, the Federal Reserve Board will not raise rates.
<P>

<B>Bond markets</B><BR>		
Because the value of fixed-income investments can be jeopardized by inflation, bond markets will be mixed in their reaction to signs of a slowing economy and rising inflation.<BR>
<B>Silvia's analysis of the December 6, 1996, report: Bond rates will stay fairly steady in a narrow trading range.</B>
<P>

<B>Stock markets</B><BR>
Equity investors are encouraged by news that can support corporate profits. But while they favor a healthy economy, they, too, worry about inflation's potential to erode value.<BR>
<B>Silvia's analysis of the December 6, 1996, report: The report of large wage increases along with slower but still positive growth suggests a more cautious outlook on profits.</B>
<P>

<B>Interest rates</B><BR>
The current short-term federal funds rate is 5.26%.
