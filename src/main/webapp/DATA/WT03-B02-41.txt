NAIC: 'RE-ENGINEERING' NEW BUZZWORD

The NAIC era of heavy growth and large regulatory nets is over,
marked by the resignation of David Simmons, the NAIC executive vice
president, and the embracing of "regulatory re-engineering," as the
association's new strategy.
        The upcoming annual commissioners retreat beginning Jan.19 will
carry regulatory efficiency forward under the guidance  of Brian Atchinson,
the NAIC's new president, Kansas Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius and Iowa
Commissioner Terri Vaughan, according to Atchinson.
        Happy to leave regulation to the regulators, Simmons is working on
arranging to take a position as a lawyer in private practice.
        Simmons remarked that during his tenure, the NAIC experienced a lot
of growth while improving the quality of service to its membership.
        The rate of growth will now abate considerably, he said, which it
perhaps should. "I think its time to slow the rate of growth," he said.
        Whether or not that is adopted as an official strategy, those who
are championing regulatory re-engineering appear determined to prune
excessive regulations.
        The project picks up where last year's regulatory efficiency effort
left off, according to the regulators involved.
        Atchinson pointed to the comments and suggestions made by the
industry on how to improve and streamline insurance supervision during the
December meeting of the Regulatory Efficiency Special Committee as a
guideline in configuring the re-engineering effort.
        Sebelius serves as chair of the newly-formed Regulatory Re-
engineering Special Committee, Vaughan as vice-chair. They were appointed
by the officers in December.
        "We're going to put our energy into that," Atchinson said. He said
insurance deregulation, the focus of a recent New York study, is but one
issue involved.
        Others issues to be considered or resolved by the NAIC according to
the minutes from the Regulatory Efficiency meeting in San Antonio include
the coordinated market conduct examinations due to the expense of market
conduct examinations and their redundancy, simplification of agent
licensing standardization requirements for admission and licensing.
        "Re-engineering needs to be done because we have limited resources
but global market. The demand of a global marketplace truly presents
challenges," he said.
        It will be done "in a manner that doesn't compromise consumers," he
added.
        While noting the new direction of the NAIC, Simmons' denied his
decision to leave was in any way related to the new leadership  and
budgetary priorities that could leave favored activities such as the
producer database and system for electronic rate and form filing (SERFF)
out on a limb. Instead, he just became fatigued with NAIC work, he said.
         In fact,he said he told Utah Commissioner Robert Wilcox that even
if Wilcox was elected NAIC president, he would leave. Wilcox later withdrew
his challenge of Atchinson for the chief regulatory position (See IR Nov. 6
);.
        Simmons gave notice fellow regulators about a week ago that he will
leave the association March 15. He first vocalized his intentions to the
membership during the NAIC Winter meeting in early December during a closed
meeting of the Executive Committee.
        "I don't consider myself a regulator," Simmons told IR. "I'm
basically a lawyer." Simmons had been general counsel for the NAIC in
Kansas City before rising to the executive position four years ago.
        "The position wears you out," Simmons said, noting that he was
thinking of leaving last year but decided to stayed on a while longer
because he could serve as an "institutional memory" for many of the new
regulators.
        "Now they are seasoned and I feel freer to leave," he said.
        Meanwhile, the NAIC's general counsel in Washington, Kevin T.
Cronin, will assume the position of acting executive vice president while
the NAIC conducts a national search for someone to replace Simmons. Cronin
has already become the point-man on several issues that require information
sensitive to the NAIC.

FLA. BILL TO EXPAND POLLUTION LIABILITY

The Florida House of Represent-atives is preparing a draft for a
pollution liability bill that would force insurers to rewrite policy
language  to expand their exposure and possibly reduce premiums.
        The bill targets insurance industry language describing liability
parameters for pollution claims and is being drafted by the House Insurance
Committee under the watch of its chairman, Rep. John F. Cosgrove, D-Miami.
It is intended to  bind insurers to statements made to regulators in 1970.
        Proponents of the bill at the Tallahassee law firm of Greenberg,
Traurig, Hoffman, Lipoff Rosen & Quentel submitted a white paper to the
House through their involvement in the Coalition to Preserve Environmental
Insurance Coverage that details a proposed amendment enforceable through
the state insurance department.
        The paper argues that the 1993 state Supreme Court case, Dimmitt
Chevrolet v. Southeastern Fidelity Insurance Corp., 17 Fla. Law W. S 579,
on rehearing, undermined the state's pollution abatement efforts and
shouldn't be allowed to influence the outcome of litigation over an
insurance claim.
        The final Dimmitt decision upheld insurers' denial of gradual
pollution claims and ruled that the language of the pollution exclusion was
unambiguous and didn't cover events that were "unexpected and unintended,"
only those that were "abrupt or instantaneous."
         The problem is that insurers had vouched to regulators that they
would still cover events that were unexpected and unintended, i.e., gradual
unintentional pollution, in seeking to exclude intentional pollution acts
in 1970, according to arguments and amicus briefs cited in the white paper.
        In 1970, the insurance industry had made representations to the
insurance department that although liability would exclude intentional acts
of pollution, it would still cover events that were "unexpected and
unintended," according to a Dimmitt amicus brief filed by the attorney
general's office.
        The phrase was supposedly a clarification of "an abrupt and
instantaneous event," which is a covered claim.
         However, the court ruled that statements made to state regulators
by insurers couldn't be considered by the state courts because the language
of the exclusion itself was unambiguous.
        Therefore, Fred Baggett, a partner at Greenberg, Traurig is urging
Cosgrove's office to include in its bill:
         That liability insurers, upon receipt of a claim for coverage for
environmental damages, construe the policies under which the claim was
brought in accordance with the statements they have made to state
regulators in 1970 regarding the language of those policies.
         A right of action in the event an insured is damaged by its
insurer's failure to comply with this requirement.
         Make violations of this requirement an act that may be prosecuted
by the insurance commissioner.
         The rules would not apply retroactively to closed claims and
wouldn't require an insurer to take into account oral statements made
outside the regulatory record; only written statements on the record would
serve as the basis for coverage.
        "If Dimmitt is allowed to stand, it will mean that there was a
massive reduction in coverage provided to insurers in 1970 with no
reduction in premiums for over two decades, the white paper asserts.
        Furthermore, the author suggests that Hurricane Andrew's aftermath
drew sympathy from the courts towards the policies of insurance companies.
        The possibility "that such considerations did have an influence
requires increased scrutiny and immediate action by the legislature," the
white paper.

        While the draft of the bill by Cosgrove and the insurance committee
is underway, it probably won't be ready for a few weeks. The Florida
legislature's session begins in early March.
        The proposed amendment to 18 Fla. Law W. S 400  shouldn't cause any
financial burden on insurers in Florida, Baggett argues in his paper.
        Since insurers haven't "been issuing policies with the 'sudden and
accidental' exclusion since the mid-1980s, the amendment directly addresses
largely historical policies, not current policies, and will have no effect
on current underwriting," it concludes.

MISSOURI LOSES GRIP ON STOP-LOSS

Missouri became the first state to lose its stop-loss jurisdiction
altogether after a recent court decision, potentially setting a damaging
precedent to other states seeking to amend their stop-loss statutes to
approach the NAIC model act.
        In a decision that marked a victory for employers and some insurers
to keep the NAIC out of the self-funded health care market, a Cole County
circuit court judge ruled that the Missouri insurance department has no
statutory authority to regulate stop-loss coverage issued to employers on
behalf of self-funded, noninsurer health plans.
        The department was seeking to implement terms of the model law on
stop-loss adopted by the NAIC in September when it was sued by a life
insurance company and three state business associations in November.
        In Associated Industries of Missouri, The Missouri Chamber of
Commerce, General American Life Insurance Co. and St. Louis Area Business
Health Coalition v. the Missouri Department of Insurance and Jay Angoff,
Director, No. CV195-1326CC, the court said the proposed regulation is
directly pre-empted by Erisa.
        The plaintiffs had only sought to enjoin the amendments to the
rule, not the rule itself, and the department has been talking with them
since the decision to clarify that point as a basis for future legal
action, according to a department spokesperson.
        Other departments such as Maryland's have sought to adjust their
stop-loss provisions and are responding to lawsuits over their
implementation of the NAIC model act,and if not, according to the position
of the Self-Insurance Institute of America, soon will. (See IR, Nov. 20).
        The Missouri rule, set to take effect on the first of the year,
would have established when stop-loss coverage would be deemed a medical
expense, established that the purpose of stop-loss coverage is to cover
catastrophic losses and specified which insurance laws are applicable to
stop-loss coverage.
        The NAIC set a $20,000 attachment point for employee group health
claims, under which they are considered health insurance. But stop loss
coverage is issued to an employer or self-funded health plan to pay for
catastrophic losses over and above the expected claims for the plan, so is
not under the rubric of employee-benefiting group health insurance,
according to the judicial opinion.
        Missouri's rule would have raised the attachment point to $10,000
from $7,500 as a compromise. Now, no attachment point exists, meaning group
health insurance plans could have a lower limit as low as $1 theoretically,
according to a department spokesperson.
        But adding stop-loss group health insurance to the definition of
group health insurance, Angoff is "illegally usurping authority over stop-
loss coverages under the guise of regulating group health insurance,"
according to the opinion.
        The department will appeal, saying the decision due to go into
effect Jan. 27, will affect hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people
and threaten the viability of group health market.

DEFINITION OF TERMS

NAIC President Brian Atchinson came up with the loaded buzzword
"regulatory re-engineering," but now it will be up to the other NAIC
members to define it  and put it into effect.
        In business, re-engineering typically has referred to redesigning a
company's working structure from the ground up, rather than an effort to
peel costs and staff off the core, although a reduction in costs is often
the result. However, the "increasingly limited resources" of the NAIC, as
one regulator put it, will probably result in some old-fashioned down-
sizing. According to Terri Vaughan, vice chair of the regulatory
reengineering committee. Atchinson and Kathleen Sebelius, the committee's
chair, re-engineering includes:
         Streamlining and consistency: Consistency in reporting forms is
one element of re-engineering. Variations in forms such as annual statement
and continuing education forms will be examined for creating more
consistency among them.
        However, total uniformity is not the goal, just eliminating those
areas that are a result of failure to better coordinate.
         Deregulation: There is a proposed charge to look at the
feasibility of deregulating some commercial lines of insurance.
"Deregulation is perhaps an exercise that each of the states will evaluae
depending upon where they are," Sebelius noted.
         Reassigning limited resources: There will be a push to focus on
the big picture and draw back from nit-picky activities, Sebelius
suggested.
        For example, pulling employees away from rote file approvals and
refocusing them on market conduct records.

CONN. AGENTS PUSH LANGUAGE COVERING BANKS

Insurance agents in Connecticut are proposing regulatory language
addressing bank sale of annuities in a 15-16 page working draft soon to be
circulating among state insurance and banking department officials.
        "The goal is not to inhibit the banks but instead have them realize
their unique position among financial institutions," according to an
industry representative working on a draft for the department.
        Meanwhile, the banks are waiting and remain in the dark about
developments in the working draft, according to a banking lawyer, who has
not yet seen an internal insurance department working draft, whose next
stop is said to be the state banking department.
        "There is no draft," an insurance department spokesperson said.
        New regulatory language is necessary to guide the way for national
banks in Connecticut to sell annuities. Banks have been able to apply for
licenses since a partial settlement was reached with Shawmut National Bank
last fall, but no bank has yet applied because institutions are waiting to
see the regulatory language, the department's director of licensing has
said before.
        That's not entirely true, suggested Rob Taylor of the Hartford law
firm Day, Berry & Howard.
        Some banks are delaying as they await the outcome of the Shawmut
and Barnett Bank decisions as well as the completion of the Shawmut/Fleet
National Bank merger, he said. But if banks would apply, perhaps the
department would feel pressured to promulgate the regulatory language soon.
The department has said that it would deliver a decision on a bank's
license within two to three weeks of receiving an application.
        Taylor helped represent Shawmut when the insurance department sued
it for attempting to sell insurance from one of its local branches.
        "Our position is to make sure that the bank people are properly
trained," said Warren C. Ruppar, the executive vice president of the
Independent Insurance Agents of Connecticut.
        Other provisions the agents have been trying to work into the draft
include consumer protection language that would prevent banks from
accessing a bank customer's personal financial records and minimizing the
potential for coercion. "For instance, if you are applying for a loan, the
issue of separation is very, very important," he said.
         The access to personal financial records worries the industry
because it is worried about a level playing field, Ruppar noted. For
instance, if you are applying for a loan, the issue of separation is very,
very important.
        He isn't sure which of the various suggestions to level that field,
which include exclusion of records or equal access to them, will make it
into the final regulatory language.
        "We're in the midst of a regulatory discussion on whether it should
be a straight and full prohibition of access or various other ways," he
said.
        Also, the assurance that there is full disclosure and a signed
customer acknowledgement that the insurance products aren't FDIC-insured
should be necessary, according to the agents.

NEW YORK SNAGS TWO AUTO INSURERS

A Pennsylvania insurer got slapped with $142,590 fine from the New
York Insurance Department for myriad claims violations in connection with
its automobile insurance policies, while a New York company received a
$105,520 fine for similar violations.
        Worldwide Underwriters Insurance Co. of Frazier violated the law
when it failed to send to insureds initial and follow-up no-fault
applications and verification forms in a timely manner, the department
charged.
        The department's charges are based on a market conduct
investigation of Worldwide that revealed that violations occurred between
May 1991 and April 1992.
        Country-Wide Insurance Co.'s slighter smaller fine reflects a
slighter smaller list of offenses uncovered in a market conduct exam
conducted between June 1993 and May 1994. Country-Wide, of New York City,
for example, didn't get cited for failing to report losses to the National
Insurance Crime Bureau within specified time limits, as was Worldwide.
        Among the other charges included in the stipulation signed by
Worldwide include failure to resolve claims within specified time frames
and provide insureds with notices explaining delays in claims.
        The company also failed to follow guidelines for the inspection and
documentation of damaged vehicles and failed to make timely good faith
offers to policyholders.
        The company also committed calculation errors. It failed to
appropriately calculate overdue no-fault benefits and reimburse claimants
for lost wages up to their policy limits. It also failed to use the correct
figures in calculating the value of lost or stolen vehicles.
        Worldwide must review all no-fault and total loss payments made
between July 1994, and December 1995. Country-Wide must conduct similar
reviews and also perform quarterly self-audits.

NORTHEAST ZONE: MAJOR REFORM SLATED FOR N.Y. WORKERS COMP

The governor of New York has announced he is directing state
regulators to introduce a sweeping reform plan for workers compensation
during the 1996 legislative session.
        In his state-of-the state address Jan. 3, Gov. George E. Pataki
challenged the existing workers comp laws by stating that "they do not
fairly serve either workers or employers."
        "In recent years, costs skyrocketed, and the injured worker
received no better service or medical care," Pataki stated.
        Pataki was riding the theme of creating more jobs and greater
opportunity and diminishing "pointless" regulation in his speech, a
continuing theme for his administration whose early momentum brought about
a recently concluded plan for regulatory reform in the state insurance
department.
        There appears to be a lot of force behind the push to reform in New
York.
        The industry has been working closely with the business community
to make sure that workers comp reform and other problems that plague.the
industry are dealt with, said a representative for the American Insurance
Association's Northeast region. "Other attempts at change were Band-Aids;
more serious surgery is required," she said.
        Pataki has charged Labor Commissioner John Sweeney and Workers
Compensation Board Chairman Robert Snashall as well as his director of
regulatory reform, Bob King, with submitting a reform plan to him within 90
days. The governor will be proposing a bill to both the state Assembly and
Senate.
        The New York Workers Comp Action Network of Syracuse, which
organized two years ago to produce reform, will also be introducing a bill.
        Last year, managed care was introduced into workers comp and rates
decreased by 5%, according to Pataki.

MIDWEST ZONE: KANSAS HMO BILL HEADED TO LEGISLATURE

Kathleen Sebelius, the Kansas insurance commissioner, is calling
for a major update of the consumer protection elements of the state's
managed care market months after she defined insurance to create more
clarity in the marketplace.
        And she's looking to her neighbor in Missouri HMO law for help.
        The state legislature opened its chambers for the 1996 season last
week and Sebelius was there with her legislative agenda, which includes
notice of a bill draft on the Kansas HMO act.
        The act has not been significantly amended since it was first
approved by the legislature in 1974, Sebelius has pointed out. Sebelius
issued a bulletin in late November outlining the parameters of "insurance"
for managed care regulatory purposes, a step both Ohio and Florida have
also undertaken. (See IR, Dec. 11).
        The draft bill will include provisions found in the current NAIC
model act, except in the areas of solvency and deposit requirements and
grievance procedures, where the bill will follow the provisions in the
Missouri HMO law.
        Additional disclosure requirements of the financial agreements
between providers and managed care organizations are also on the agenda.
        The solvency standards in Missouri are done on a sliding scale
based on revenues detailed in the company's marketing plan and has run over
$1 million in capital, according to a spokesperson for the Missouri
department. To enter the state, a group health plan's capital threshold
must be $150,000.
        HMOs in Missouri must have an internal grievance procedure for the
first wave of complaints, the spokesperson noted, referencing the 1983
state law and its further provisions.
        Sebelius also hopes to follow the route Missouri took for enrollee
participation in the business operations of the HMO and for payment for
emergency room care.
        Enrollees in Missouri receive the annual statement of their HMO's
financial condition, full descriptions of organizational changes, where and
how to obtain services and a detailed description of the complaint process.
All these requirements are fleshed out through market conduct procedures,
the spokesperson said.

WEST ZONE: TEXAS BRINGS VIATICALS TO REGULATORY TABLE

The Texas Department of Insurance is closer to joining almost a
dozen other states that have implemented viatical settlement protection
rules with a hearing Commissioner Elton Bomer held Jan. 9.
        The proposed rules to protect terminally ill Texans who sell their
life insurance policies for immediate cash were described as "bare bones"
reporting standards by a department spokesperson.
        The reporting would have the viatical company reveal such
information as the location, size and key employees of a viatical company.
The department would also seek enough information to ascertain whether
customers were being treated fairly, according to the spokesperson.
        Misleading advertisements and marketing schemes would be ruled as a
violation of departmental regulations, as would dishonoring the privacy of
the applicants. All advertising material, forms and marketing plans must be
approved by the department, under the proposed rules.
        Insurance companies no longer could hold the policy for longer than
they should when they find out it is to be used for a viatical settlement,
as some have, the spokesperson said.
        The viatical policies must also reveal the tax consequences of
settling to the applicant, as well as other consequences,such as loss of
welfare or Medicare benefits. The company must also notify applicants of a
15-day right of rescission in their decision to sell their policies under
the proposed rules.
        However, no capital requirements of viaticals will be necessary in
Texas.
        Companies will need a certificate of registration to do business
without which they will be in violation of regulations and be subject to
revocation of their certificate. The department may deny certificate of
registration.
        Bomer is reviewing the testimony of the 16 parties who testified at
the hearing will make a decision on the final rules in the near future, the
spokesperson said.

TAX SIMPLIFICATION COULD BLAST BALANCE SHEETS

Tax simplification could have a drastic effect on corporate balance
sheets, wiping out as much as $3 trillion in equity, according to tax
experts at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants who have
just completed a major study of alternatives to the current system.
        Many observers in Washington and on Wall Street believe that
Congress will undertake a major overhaul of the tax system by the turn of
the century. But the new AICPA study indicates that the "unintended
consequences" of some of the tax reform plans that have been put forth are
so great that the proposals will collapse of their own weight.
        "The level of discussion in the last two or three years (about tax
reform) has gotten to be significant, but once you look at some of this
information you become less certain that people will want to jump into
that," said Deborah Walker, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner and chair of the
AICPA's Tax Executive Committee.
        "The AICPA has long been an advocate of tax simplification, but
there are many, many unanswered questions," said Barry C. Melancon, AICPA
president.
        Various proposals have been made in Washington, and they differ in
many significant ways. But in general they would do away with the current
income-based system of taxation and replace it with one based on
consumption.
        Byrle M. Abbin, a retired partner and now a consultant at Arthur
Andersen, warned of "dire" effects on financial statements from tax
simplification.
        First, there would be some gains from the elimination of the
corporate income tax. He noted that $600 billion in deferred tax
liabilities would no longer be owed while just $100 billion in deferred tax
assets would be wiped out by a flat tax.
        But the big crunch would become with the imposition of a
consumption tax.
        "Without transition relief, deductions for depreciation of existing
assets would not be allowed under the new tax, and the entire proceeds from
a theoretical sale of assets at the end of the reporting year for the
initial application of the new tax law would be included in the tax base,"
the AICPA said in its new study, "Flat Taxes and Consumption Taxes: A Guide
to the Debate."
        Assuming a 10% tax rate and given that corporations have $20
trillion in tax basis, "it is possible that $2 trillion of deferred tax
liabilities would be created upon the enactment of this new tax," the AICPA
said.
        Under FAS 109, this entire amount, which could be higher with a
higher tax rate, would have to be booked in the year of tax change.
        "This would more than wipe out total corporate profits in any one
year and severely reduce the amount of shareholders' equity," the AICPA
warned. "Thus financial statements would have to reflect the enormous
increase in future taxes that results from lost depreciation deductions or
taxable gain on sales due to the elimination of tax basis."
        "The desire for efficiency and simplification has to be balanced
with problems of fairness," Abbin said. He acknowledged that some of these
problems could be reduced or resolved with appropriate transition rules.
But he predicted a battle royal over those rules.
        "Even if you do have transition rules, first you are going to have
strong discussions involving FASB, the SEC, the accounting profession and
Congress," he said. "It would be a tough, tough confrontation."
        Tax simplification could present additional problems for insurers.
Not the least of these would be the loss of tax advantaged status for many
life products and for policy payouts. In addition, however, insurance
companies and other financial service providers may find themselves subject
to a special tax regime.
        "Because it is difficult to identify and value services provided by
financial institutions, no country with a consumption tax has been able to
tax financial services in a manner consistent with consumption tax
principles," the AICPA said. "Exemption of financial institutions from
consumption tax generally results in overtaxation of financial services
provided to businesses and undertaxation of services provided to
consumers."
        In general the tax burden would increase for labor-intensive
businesses, such as insurers, and decrease for capital-intensive ones, the
AICPA said. While tax rates may be cut dramatically, tax outlays could
actually increase.
        "Even though the (proposed) rates sound low, you have to remember
that people don't pay rates, they pay taxes," Abbin said. "There'll be a
whole host of companies with lower rates that will have higher taxes to pay
because major components of their business cannot be deducted."
        Another area where there could be surprising consequences to tax
reform is in international operations. "The exclusion of exports from gross
receipts provides large tax benefits to those firms that export," the AICPA
said.
        In addition, Abbin said that the "U.S. could become a tax haven"
under some of the reform proposals. "This could bring retaliation from
foreign countries where we have operations." --Miles Maguire
