<center><h3>FBI PRESSED BY INDUSTRY FOR BETTER WIRETAP DATA</center></h3>
<p>
<font size = +1>Telecom industry told FBI that it couldn't comply with Bureau's needs for increased wiretap capacity unless it gets some figures that clearly define what agency's needs will be. In comments submitted to FBI Jan. 16, several telecom industry organizations, as well as Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), which filed jointly with Center for National Security Studies, said that FBI's foray into notice-and -comment process was woefully unsuccessful because Bureau had failed to provide adequate information. USTA said: "Companies need to know precisely what is involved in complying with the law. They cannot afford a lack of specificity which could result in inadvertent non-compliance."

FBI last fall sought comments on implementing Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). In Oct. 16 <i>Federal Register</i>  notice, FBI asked for comment on how much switching capacity industry should reserve for wiretapping of advanced digital telephony systems. however, terms FBI used in expressing its needs in terms of percentages of "engineered capacity" puzzled telecom industry then, and do so today. USTA said that basis FBI used for its proposal wasn't related to network design principles used in telecom industry and as result industry couldn't respond adequately to FBI's proposals. Commenters told FBI that agency is required by law to set out actual and maximum numbers of wiretaps that will be needed, as well as providing historical data to back up requirements. FBI has complied with neither, commenters said.

USTA noted that requirements for wiretaps, pen registers and trap-and-trace devices must be provided on a switch-by-switch basis so that engineers can design into each switch number of intercepts that would be needed. for that number to be accurate, historical information is needed, commenters said. USTA argued that FBI's Oct. 16 proposals "bear no rational relationship to past law enforcement needs. Some member companies report that the proposed percentage capacity requirement would require setting aside for law enforcement purposes several times the historic electronic surveillance needs." NTCA said FBI proposal could put unfair burden on small telcos. CDT said that Bureau promised to make available historical data, but hasn't yet done so. Agency must make public basis for its request before law can be implemented, CDT said, adding that data are necessary for public accountability.

Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) said that FBI had promised to make available records of its meetings with industry to help clear up questions and to provide information on standard being developed with Bellcore for electronic surveillance. Neither of those has been published, TIA said, and FBI should consider making separate requirements for each type of wiretap it needs, with capacity for each. Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) said FBI proposal didn't adequately define responsibilities for existing wireless services, such as cellular networks, or emerging services such as PCS, and hadn't responded to CTIA requests for clarification. </font>
