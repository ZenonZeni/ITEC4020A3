<B>Valid Outdoors Card Required
for Moose Hunt Validation Tag Draw
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Hunters are reminded that they must have a valid Outdoors Card to enter this year's moose hunt validation tag draw.  As well, it may be time for some to renew their card.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="oc.gif"></CENTER><P>
Applications for the moose hunt validation tag draw must be received by 
May 15, 1996, and card holders are required to submit renewals at least three weeks before the deadline to avoid delays and help ensure they receive a new card in time to participate in the draw.  Cards can be renewed by mail or by telephone.<P>

Renewal application forms were mailed automatically to Outdoors Card holders before the expiry date.  They can also be obtained by calling 1-800-387-7011.  Hunters may also renew their card directly by telephone by calling the automated Outdoors Card renewal hot line, at 1-800-288-1155.  Hunters should note the telephone option provides faster service.<P>

Card holders whose card will expire in 1996 should ensure that MNR has their current address.  To report a change of address please contact MNR by calling the toll free line at 1-800-387-7011.

<P>
<B>Editor's note:</B>  A 1996 Moose Hunter Fact Sheet will be available from most licence issuers and local MNR offices by late April.<P>
