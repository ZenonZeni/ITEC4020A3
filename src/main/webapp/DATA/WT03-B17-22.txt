Vietsovpetro vs. Western Oil Majors?
</font><hr>

<font size=+1>
Still No Contest
</font><p>

Being a product of the now defunct Soviet Union, in 1990, Vietsovpetro seemed like it would be marginalized by the Western oil majors rushing into Vietnam. Five years later, the $1.5 billion Russian-Vietnamese JV remains Vietnam's biggest oil producer and is likely to maintain that distinction until at least year 2000.<p>

Because Vietsovpetro was established in 1981, well before the promulgation of Vietnam's foreign investment law in 1987, the company's operations usually are not reflected in official investment statistics. However, between 1988 and 1995, official foreign direct investment projects contributed $534 million to the state budget of Vietnam - four times less than the amount contributed by Vietsovpetro alone.<p>

It is estimated that Vietsovpetro contributed $2.2 billion in taxes and royalties during a period from 1991-95. For the next five years, the figure is expected to rise to $3.87 billion. 
The 50-50, Vietnamese-Russian JV is exploiting the Bach Ho (White Tiger)  and Rong (Dragon) oil and gas fields in the Eastern sea off southern Vietnam.<p>

Since beginning production in 1986, the JV has produced a total of 37 million metric tons of crude oil. Through the first three months of 1996, the JV has accounted for 95% of Vietnam's oil production, pumping around 2 million tons of crude.<p>

Though some believe production at Bach Ho could have been higher if more advanced techniques had been used, Vietsovpetro claims to be the most efficient company drilling on the Vietnamese shelf. "Our wells not only produce better results, we are also approximately five times less expensive that the wells of other companies," JV representatives say. 
Lower expenses may be the result, in large measure, of the low wages of both Vietnamese and Russian oilers. About 20% of the JVs 6,000-strong workforce are expats, with Russian employees said to be earning about $1000 per month. Wages for Vietnamese oilers, on the other hand, can range between $180 to $420 per month, in 15-day, 12 hour per day shifts, with the rest of the month off.<p>

As far as future projects are concerned, "We do not exclude the possibility of establishing a new JV with Russia," PetroVietnam chairman Ho Si Thoang said. A Russian official confirmed their interest in signing a new PSC with PetroVietnam, saying, "We'd prefer the block which is relatively close to the Bach Ho oil field," but declined to elaborate.<p>
