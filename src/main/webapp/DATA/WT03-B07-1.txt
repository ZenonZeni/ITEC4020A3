 ARGENTINA: CAVALLO FINALLY SACKED JUST BEFORE FRESH ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS 
with IMF

 Economy minister Domingo Cavallo should have known that his number was up 
when President Carlos Menem gave him his full backing on 19 July, in the 
face of concerted attacks from the trade unions and deputies of the ruling 
Partido Justicialista (see WR-96-29). The trouble is, it had happened so 
many times before that it was difficult to know when the President no longer 
meant what he said. On 26 July, Menem gave Cavallo the sack.

 The long-serving minister had been at loggerheads with both President and 
party for so long that there seemed no reason to suppose the latest episode 
was any different from earlier ones.

 Only days before he was dismissed, Cavallo had prevailed upon Menem to push 
through, by presidential decree, a new round of unpopular fiscal austerity 
measures. These were in response to figures indicating that tax revenues in 
the first half-year had fallen well short of what was expected, leading to a 
fiscal deficit of US Dollars 2.508bn: slightly more than the total agreed 
with the International Monetary Fund for the whole year.

 Cavallo had been due to begin negotiations with the Fund in mid-August for 
a waiver on the targets set in the earlier agreement. He prepared the way by 
ordering a series of spending cuts and tax increases, designed to cut the 
deficit by up to US Dollars 1bn a year.

 Some 2.4m workers stood to lose benefits when state aid for dependent 
families was cut, and more than 1m may face reductions in food subsidies 
paid by employers as part of the total wage.

 The trade unions grouped in the Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT), 
traditionally associated with the ruling Peronist party, responded by 
calling a general strike for 8 August, just before talks with the Fund were 
due to begin.

 Unions feel that the workers have been made to carry the can for the 
failures of government economic policies -just as PJ deputies feel the party 
suffered the consequences of their unpopularity in the Buenos Aires mayoral 
elections at the end of June.

 Relations between government and unions have been made even more strained 
by the latest unemployment figures, which put joblessness in the country as 
a whole at 17.1%. The figure last October was an already high 16.4%. The 
situation is considerably worse in Buenos Aires, at 20.4%.

 Menem has promised that the replacement of Cavallo by central bank 
president Roque Fernandez means no changes to economic policy. Foreigners, 
who loved Cavallo, may take some convincing.

 CHILE: COPPER: SUMITOMO SCANDAL CAUSES HEADACHES: CODELCO RECALCULATES 
REVENUE PROJECTIONS

 While the rest of the world has been debating whether or not former 
Sumitomo copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka was a rogue operator out of the Nick 
Leeson mould, Chileans in general and the state-owned Codelco copper 
corporation in particular have been recalculating their projections of 
export earnings for this year.

 Price falls. There seems little doubt that the fall in the world copper 
price in the wake of the Sumitomo debacle will cut Chile's foreign exchange 
revenues and add to the country's swelling current account deficit this year 
(see detailed figures in WR-96-28). There will be longer-term effects, too.

 One of them is that the US Dollars 240m Lomas Bayas mine project is being 
delayed by Gibraltar Mines of Canada, as it has been unable to raise the 
necessary financing. The company had been hoping to bring the mine onstream 
in 1998, with annual output of 60,000-90,000 tonnes per year.

 Chile currently produces about 30% of the world's copper (1.2m tpy), and 
investment plans aim to raise that proportion to 40% by the beginning of the 
new millennium. So any reduction in its revenues, and any delays in 
investment projects, have potentially serious implications.

 By mid-July, Codelco had calculated that its income would fall by about US 
Dollars 500m this year. Profits in 1995 amounted to US Dollars 1.7bn, thanks 
to an average world price of US Dollars 1.34/lb. This year marketing vice-
president Juan Eduardo Herrera puts projected revenues no higher than US 
Dollars 1.2bn, on the assumption that the copper price will be around US 
Dollars 1.05-US Dollars 1.10/lb by the end of the year. Original 
calculations were based on an average price of US Dollars 1.15-US Dollars 
1.20/lb.

 Herrera remains optimistic, however, that the situation might begin to 
improve from September, by which time the depressing effect on prices of 
Sumitomo's desperate unloading of its copper stocks, in an attempt to recoup 
losses of US Dollars 1.8bn, might have begun to work itself out.

 Military share. One contentious proposal put forward by Codelco to offset 
the loss of revenues is to stop paying the armed forces the 10% share of 
gross sales revenues to which they are entitled by law. This idea has 
already been put forward by Codelco executive president Juan Villarzu, 
backed by Herrera. The government, however (and of course the military), are 
not keen.

 Villarzu sees the transfer of all military financing obligations to the 
general state budget as the only way to keep Codelco's investment plans -and 
particularly exploration projects in Peru and Argentina- on track. Codelco 
paid over US Dollars 340m to the military last year.

 The government, however, nipped this idea in the bud. 'It's not on our 
agenda,' said interior minister Carlos Figueroa in mid-June. He added that, 
however reasonable the proposal might seem, and however much support it 
might have across the political spectrum, this was not a good moment to 
suggest it.

 Another possible way forward for Codelco -privatisation of the company, as 
advocated by the right-wing opposition- has also been ruled out by the 
government. It proposes instead a restructuring of the corporation, under 
which each mine would become an autonomous division, making its own business 
decisions.

 Legislation to that effect has been passed by the lower house of congress 
but blocked in the senate, where the opposition argues that it envisages an 
unacceptably subordinate role for private capital. The government retorts 
that private interests are welcome to enter into exploration agreements with 
Codelco, as Cyprus Amax has done for the El Abra project. But the four big 
existing mines -Chuquicamata, El Teniente, Adina and Salvador, plus the new 
Radomiro Tomic project -must remain in state hands.

 CLUES TO CODELCO FRAUD

 One positive side-effect of the Sumitomo affair might be to cast some light 
on the fraud perpetrated against Codelco by one of its traders in 1993. Juan 
Pablo Davila lost US Dollars 175m for Codelco by unsuccessful speculation in 
the futures market over a period of about four years, and was imprisoned for 
his pains. He still faces trial on fraud charges.

 Codelco is anxious to find out if Davila and Hamanaka had the same 
international contacts and used the same methods for concealing their 
operations. The corporation has already suggested that the London Metals 
Exchange should tighten up its regulatory procedures, which it regards as 
inadequate to control the activities of skilful speculators.

 PINOCHET SUCCESSION

 One reason why the government does not want to rock the boat over military 
finances is that the delicate matter of the succession to General Pinochet 
as commander-in-chief of the army is currently under discussion.

 Defence minister Edmundo Perez Yoma confirmed at the beginning of July that 
President Eduardo Frei would use a special law to defer the retirement of 
one of four senior generals for a year to smooth the transition from 
Pinochet when he finally bows out in March 1998.

 The four senior generals due to retire on 30 September this year, who might 
be beneficiaries of the so-called 'Canessa law,' are deputy commander 
Guillermo Garin, chief of staff Ricardo Quas, inspector-general Jaime Concha 
Pantoja and the commander of the first army corps, Ramon Castro Ivanovic.

 ROBOTS IN THE MINES

 Aware that a low level of technological innovation is one of the weak 
points of its development model (see WR-96-27), the Chilean government has 
begun to experiment with automated systems in the copper mines. The El 
Teniente division of Codelco announced at the beginning of July that it 
would use Chilean-developed robots in its new Esmeralda mine, which is 
expected to come onstream in the second half of next year.

 Economy minister Alvaro Garcia has called for a doubling of the present 
level of investment in technological innovation, which is only 0.8% of GDP, 
or US Dollars 480m a year; 23% of that is spent by the private sector.

 CHILE: DRUGS: SEVEN HELD AFTER BIG COCAINE BUST: FORMER COLOMBIAN DIPLOMAT 
AMONG THOSE ARRESTED

 The seizure of 600kg of cocaine in the port of San Antonio, south of 
Santiago, on 10 July focused attention once again on the increasing use of 
Chile as a transit country for drug shipments from Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia to markets in other parts of the world. It also revived interest in 
a scandal allegedly involving drug-trafficking in the Chilean congress.

 Seven arrests. The interior ministry announced a tightening-up of controls 
at ports, airports and frontier crossings in the wake of the San Antonio 
episode, for which seven people were subsequently arrested, including two 
Colombians.

 One of them, Alberto Botero, was a former diplomat assigned to Santiago who 
had left the Colombian foreign service in 1995 to go into the clothing 
import business in the city. His sister, Constanza, was also detained after 
her arrival from Colombia a few days before the seizure. An examining 
magistrate, Marcos Felzestein, has been put in charge of the case.

 Carabineros General Ruben Olivares, head of the anti-drug directorate, said 
Chile had been selected as a transit country because of the high 
international reputation of its exporters; the mere fact that goods were 
from Chile meant that customs checks in the United States and Europe were 
less rigorous than usual.

 The San Antonio consignment, the biggest ever confiscated in Chile, with an 
estimated street value of US Dollars 14.5m, had been bound for Miami. The 
drugs were concealed in three autoclaves, used for sterilising surgical 
instruments, all of which had false bottoms.

 The merchandise had been unloaded in a container a few days earlier from a 
Colombian-flag merchant ship, belonging to the Flota Mercante 
Grancolombiana. The Chilean customs authorities did not believe the shipping 
line was aware of what was in the container. The gang involved had been 
under surveillance for two months, the police reported.

 The largest previous confiscation of cocaine in Chile was in 1989, when 
500kg of the drug were found in a container in the port of Arica. 

 Enter Investigaciones. Que Pasa magazine claimed in mid-July that 
Carabineros had been dragging their feet over the inquiry into the alleged 
drug-trafficking racket in congress, forcing Valparaiso examining magistrate 
Roberto Contreras to turn to the plain-clothes police (Investigaciones) for 
help with phone-tapping and covert surveillance -operations in which 
Carabineros refused to become involved.

 The right-wing magazine claims that officials of the ruling Christian 
Democrat group in congress were implicated, and at least one of those 
interrogated had agreed to cooperate under a plea-bargaining arrangement. 
The involvement of deputies, it said, had yet to be established. 
Distributors and buyers of the cocaine, which was brought into Chile through 
Arica, appeared to be administrative and security personnel of both 
chambers.

 On 28 June the first arrests were made by Investigaciones, including the 
former secretary of the PDC group in congress, Maria Luisa Espejo.

 Nelson Mery, head of Investigaciones, said at the beginning of the year 
that drug-trafficking was his main target, and that he was in favour of all 
public officials submitting to random drug tests.

 CHILE: ECONOMY: INCOME INEQUALITY JIBE UPSETS ANINAT: MINISTER SAYS HIGH 
GROWTH, LOW INFLATION ARE THE ANSWER

 Even as a remarkable upsurge in economic activity in April caused the 
government to revise upwards its projection for GDP growth this year from 
6.5% to 7%, concern was growing at the persistent poverty and widening 
income disparities that are the downside of Chile's economic success.

 The central bank reported at the end of June that growth in April was 
10.2%, and 9.3% for the first four months of the year. The figure for the 
whole of last year was 8.3%.

 Aninat regrets. Finance minister Eduardo Aninat hailed the performance as a 
guarantee of more jobs and higher wages. But two weeks later Aninat was 
expressing regret that more people wee not benefiting from the economic 
growth. He said better income distribution was desirable, provided it did 
not disturb the macro-economic equilibrium Chile had achieved at such cost.

 The minister was reacting to a World Bank report, released in Washington at 
the end of June, which said Chile had one of the most unequal income 
distributions in the world. He asserted that steady 7% growth and low 
inflation (the target is 6.5% this year) would bring greater equality of 
incomes.

 Aninat took exception to the World Bank's interpretation of Chilean 
statistics, which it said showed that 20% of the population had 61% of the 
national income. The true figure was 56%, Aninat said.

 The Bank gives Chile an income inequality index of 0.56 (on a scale of 0-
1), which is second only to Brazil (0.60) in South America.

 The Chilean government's own surveys suggest that 28% of the population 
live in poverty.

 An opinion poll in mid-July indicated that 55% of Chileans regard the 
current neo-liberal economic model as unfair -compared with 46% a year ago. 
But 55% also approve of the government's performance.

 CHILE: INSIGHT: CHILE SORTS OUT BANKS' SUBORDINATE DEBT: IN THE PROCESS, IT 
LOSES A CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT

 The recent resignation of Chile's central bank president, Roberto Zahler, 
was triggered, in his own words, by 'situations in recent months' -which he 
did not spell out, but which most analysts read as alluding to political 
pressures for a solution to a particular, longstanding problem: the US 
Dollars 4.3bn 'subordinate debt' still owed by several banks to the central 
bank for bailing them out of the crisis of 1982.

 Zahler is said to have adopted a 'tough' stand on this matter, which left 
him in a minority of one in the five-member board of the central bank. The 
precise nature of this stand is not known, but the solutions that the board 
has been approving are.

 Of the five banks who still owed substantial sums of 'subordinate debt' at 
the beginning of this year, one -Banco BHIF- has already repaid its 
obligations with the proceeds of an issue of American Depositary Receipts 
(ADRs). The state of play with the four that remain is as follows:

 Banco Concepcion (which owes US Dollars 669m) and Banco Internacional (US 
Dollars 130m) will be settling their debts soon, with an issue of shares 
which will be given to the central bank in lieu of payment -and will then be 
bought back by the shareholders at a substantial discount (about US Dollars 
182m, or 78% of their joint debt).

 Banco de Chile, which owes US Dollars 1.74bn, has struck a deal which will 
allow it to repay its debt over 40 years, also with a substantial (but as 
yet unspecified) discount.

 Banco de Santiago, which owes US Dollars 1.76bn, still has a year in which 
to reach a settlement -and is also certain to benefit from a hefty discount.

 Valparaiso-based consultant Armen Kouyoumdjian* reckons that the entire 
settlement exercise will cost the central bank about US Dollars 1.6bn.

 Attention will naturally focus on the details of the deals with the two 
last banks mentioned, Santiago and Chile, who jointly account for 81% of the 
'subordinate debt' still outstanding -and which are the two most powerful 
private banks in Chile's financial system.

 Jointly they account for just over 21% of all the lending in the Chilean 
market (11.5% for Chile and 9.6% for Santiago). The only institution with a 
larger market share is the state-owned Banco del Estado, with 12%. They are 
also quite unique in that they seem to disprove an item of common wisdom 
about Latin American banking: that big does not always mean profitable.

 These two banks, the biggest private lenders, are also the two with the 
highest returns on equity -if, that is, the 'subordinate debt' is left out 
of the calculations. (Actually, this holds true for many of the second-tier 
banks: of the next five in market share, four are among the Chilean system's 
10 most profitable banks).

 The accompanying graphs, which illustrate the position of the Chilean 
banking system at the end of June this year, show that private locally-owned 
banks are more profitable, as a group, than state banking, and that the 
latter is more profitable than the foreign-owned banks -the big exception 
being Banco Santander, which ranks both among the big lenders, with a 7% 
share, and among the 10 most profitable in the country.

 It is among the foreign-owned banks that one finds the only three 
lossmakers at mid-year: American Express, Boston and Real.

 *In his privately distributed Occasional Paper No17, The Chilean Financial 
System, of 19 July -which also provided the statistical base for the graphs 
accompanying this article.

 By the way, the appointment of a successor to Zahler may not be announced 
for another month or so. Among the candidates being mentioned are Carlos 
Massad, Jose Pablo Arellano, Manuel Marfan, Joaquin Vial and Juan Andres 
Fontaine. The latter, formerly the bank's head of research, is the candidate 
of the opposition -their contribution to an 'independence' already 
compromised by the incorporation of Pablo Pinera.

 CHILE: FOCUS: SO HOW MUCH DID CHILE INVEST ABROAD?: A LOOK AT WIDELY 
DIVERGENT ESTIMATES

 Chile-watchers are entitled to be somewhat confused. In late June, within 
four days of each other, two institutions came out with calculations of the 
amount invested by Chileans in their main foreign market which differed by a 
factor of four.

 The central bank reported that accumulated Chilean investment in Argentina, 
between 1975 and May 1996, had reached US Dollars 1.3bn -almost 42% of the 
total invested abroad by Chileans in that period.

 The Camara de Comercio put the figure for investment in Argentina at US 
Dollars 5.5bn. It did so in the context of a report noting how Peru was 
growing as the second most important market for Chilean investment, with an 
accumulated total, to end-1995, of US Dollars 2.3bn -more than the central 
bank says was invested abroad in the whole of South America.

 Two reasons have been advanced to explain the huge discrepancy between the 
two estimates. One, mentioned by Chilean entrepreneurs to the Argentine 
business magazine Apertura, is that a large portion of Chilean investment 
abroad was financed from external (non-Chilean) sources, and that the 
central bank, quite appropriately, was only accounting that portion of the 
investment which was an outflow from Chile.

 Another, suggested to us by a veteran Chile-watcher, is that in many cases 
what was being counted as Chilean investment was actually the entire value 
of ventures in which the Chileans had only a share, but had also secured the 
management of the scheme.

 The central bank figures show that in the first five months of this year 
Chileans invested abroad a further US Dollars 433.4m, increasing the total 
stock by 16%.

 The Camara de Comercio predicts that by the end of this year, Chilean 
investment in Peru alone will have reached US Dollars 3bn, increasing the 
stock there by 30%.

 The chamber notes that 110 Chilean firms are now established in Peru. About 
a third of these have acquired interests in state companies privatised by 
the Peruvian government; another 40% have set up subsidiaries of their own.

 Apart from becoming Chile's second-largest investment market, Peru is 
growing in importance as an export market: last year Chile exported US 
Dollars 438m (and imported only US Dollars 147m). Talks on a complementation 
agreement, suspended since last November, are about to be resumed.

 CHILE: ENVIRONMENT: GASANDES CHANGES PIPELINE ROUTE: PRESSURE GROUPS WIN 
PARTIAL VICTORY IN CAJON DEL MAIPO

 The protracted conflict between the communities of the Cajon del Maipo and 
the GasAndes consortium, chronicled in these pages (see RS-96-05, RS-95-07), 
was resolved at the end of June, when the two sides signed an agreement. The 
accord with the villages of San Alfonso and Pirque will enable the Chilean-
Canadian consortium to route through the community the pipeline that will 
carry natural gas 465km from Argentina to Santiago and central Chile. 
GasAndes now expects the project to be completed by May 1977.

 Partial victory. The accord represented a partial victory for the people of 
San Alfonso, as the consortium agreed to change the original route of the 
pipeline, diverting it away from residential areas and the Cascada de las 
Animas nature reserve, and stepping up security -the two main demands of the 
local activists.

 Angel Santander, president of the San Alfonso residents' committee, said he 
would have preferred the pipeline to take another route altogether, but his 
committee felt it had made its point, and accepted the agreement to avoid 
further confrontations.

 The precedent has been established, as far as environmentalists are 
concerned, that a community can negotiate directly with a big consortium and 
win important concessions. Manuel Baquedano, president of the Instituto de 
Ecologia Politica, said an 'unprecedented advance' had been achieved.

 Local improvements fund. San Alfonso will appoint its own technical 
commission to supervise the works, and GasAndes will contribute with US 
Dollars 1m to a special fund for improving local amenities.

 The accord was mediated by the chairman of the chamber of deputies, Jaime 
Estevez, following a clash with police in which several people were injured. 
'This is a debate that is only just getting under way in Chile, which 
basically concerns the contradiction between development projects and living 
standards in a community. The country has been growing for 12 consecutive 
years and these sorts of situations are going to arise again and again,' he 
said.

 'NUCLEAR DUSTBIN' PROTESTS 

 Environmental groups have joined residents of the Palena district, 1,600km 
south of Santiago, in rejecting plans for a nuclear waste site at Gastre, in 
Argentina's Chubut province, 160km from the border. Concern about a project 
that dates back to 1980 has been heightened in Chile by the Menem 
government's plans to privatise the nuclear power industry.

 Chile's Comite Pro Defensa de la Flora y Fauna (Codaff) claims that the 
material to be buried at Gastre is highly radioactive, with a half-life of 
250,000 years. Similar protests have taken place in Argentine Patagonia, and 
the governors of the southern provinces have declared the region a nuclear-
free zone.

 Potential bidders for Argentina's three nuclear power stations (one of 
which, Atucha II, is unfinished) have made availability of a waste disposal 
site a condition for their further interest. Legislation paving the way for 
the sale is making its way through the Argentine congress, in the teeth of 
fierce opposition.

 CHILE: NATIVE WOODLANDS ESTIMATE INCREASED: NEW PULP PROJECT PROVOKES 
VALDIVIA PROTEST

 The Chilean ministry of agriculture has upgraded its estimate of the total 
area of native woodlands from 8m hectares to 11m. The figure emerged from 
the country's first forest census, and was designed to allay the concerns of 
ecological groups, which fear that the country's native forests are 
dwindling fast as a result of commercial forestry. Chile's temperate rain 
forests begin at Valdivia, 830km south of Santiago, and continue to Tierra 
del Fuego.

 Agriculture minister Emiliano Ortega conceded that it was vital to protect 
the resource in the face of rising world demand for timber, wood pulp and 
chips. The pulp of native species such as alerce, trepa, coigue, lenga and 
lingue is regarded as particularly suitable for the manufacture of high-
quality computer paper. Chile's exports of forest products totalled US 
Dollars 2.4bn in 1995.

 Exports down. Exports were, however, 20% down by value and 11.3% by volume 
in the first five months of this year: US Dollars 768.7m against US Dollars 
960.9m, Jose Antonio Prado, director of the Corporacion Nacional Forestal 
(Conaf) reported on 17 July.

 Japan (19.9%), South Korea (11.8%) and the US (11.7%) remained Chile's 
principal customers, but international wood pulp and chips prices have 
fallen sharply in the early months of this year.

 Arauco project. One of the biggest wood pulp plants in the world, a 550,000 
tonnes-per-year facility costing up to US Dollars 1bn, is planned for 
Valdivia. But, taking note of growing concerns about the environmental 
impact of development projects (see RS-96-03), the government, through the 
Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente (Conama), is withholding the necessary 
permits until environmentalists' objections are addressed.

 Protected wetlands and a bird sanctuary stand to be affected by toxic 
liquid effluent from the plant, which is to be built by Celulosa Arauco, 
Chile's biggest wood pulp exporter. Proposals for a solution from the 
company threaten the livelihoods of a fishing community further up the 
coast.

 Arauco accounted for 18.7% of Chile's total forestry exports in 1995. 
Second was Celulosa del Pacifico with 10.1%. It is owned by Copec, one of 
Chile's biggest economic groups.

 ARGENTINA: POLITICS: PROTEST VOTE IN BUENOS AIRES POLLS: BOTH RADICALS AND 
FREPASO TROUNCE OFFICIAL CANDIDATE

 The first direct elections for mayor of Buenos Aires at the end of June 
were a triumph for the Union Civica Radical (UCR), a good result for Frente 
Pais Solidario (Frepaso), a disaster for the ruling Partido Justicialista 
(PJ) and a wipe-out for the far-left.

 Comeback for UCR. The UCR, an urban party if ever there was one, has had a 
patchy recent history in the capital, losing out badly to Frepaso in the 
last elections. The victory of Fernando de la Rua, who won almost 40% of the 
votes, was a clear return to favour in the party's traditional stronghold. 
He takes over on 6 August.

 'This should not be seen as the end but the beginning,' De la Rua said, 
referring perhaps not just to the Radicals' revived fortunes but to his own 
hopes of securing the party nomination for the 1999 presidential elections.

 Frepaso did better than expected, in view of its recent splits and internal 
tensions. Norberto La Porta won more than a quarter of the votes, leaving 
the incumbent, Jorge Dominguez (PJ) trailing in a distant third, only just 
ahead of Peronist defector Gustavo Beliz (Nueva Dirigencia), who was backed 
by former Frepaso leader Jose Octavio Bordon (see table).

 It was a huge protest vote against the national government, particularly 
against the corruption with which it has become associated in the public 
mind. La Porta also noted that the result was the voice of the 'pauperised 
middle classes' of the capital, who have suffered from President Carlos 
Menem's downsizing of the public sector.

 Menem attempted, however, to make the best of things, denying that the 
result was a plebiscite on his government's performance, and claiming that 
Dominguez had been the best mayor the city had ever had. He promptly 
appointed him defence minister when a vacancy arose a few days later (see 
below).
Any hope that the extreme left and assorted green parties might have had of 
capitalising on the prevailing disenchantment with the government was 
quickly scotched: they won only 1.9% of the votes between them.

 Frepaso also secured a majority in the assembly, the 60-seat Convencion 
Estatuyente, charged with drawing up the statutes under which the capital 
will henceforth be governed. Chairing the assembly will be Frepaso senator 
Graciela Fernandez Meijide, who has been outspokenly critical of the limits 
placed by the federal government on the supposedly autonomous city 
government's powers.

 GRACIELA FERNANDEZ MEIJIDE

 Senator Fernandez, 65, won 34.75% of the votes as head of the Frepaso list, 
and has established her credentials as a serious candidate for Frepaso's 
presidential nomination in 1999, despite a late start in politics. She 
entered the party at the age of 60, and was elected senator for Buenos Aires 
last October, with 45.6% of the votes.

 A teacher of French, she became a human rights activist after her son 
'disappeared' in 1977, and was a member of the 1984 commission, chaired by 
writer Ernesto Sabato, which investigated the abuses of the military regime.

 FERNANDO DE LA RUA

 The new mayor of the capital is a 58-year-old lawyer from Cordoba. He has 
served three terms as senator for Buenos Aires and was the UCR vice-
presidential candidate in 1973. Ten years later he lost out to Raul Alfonsin 
in a competition for the UCR presidential nomination, but in 1991 became 
head of the party's organisation in the capital.

 ARGENTINA: MENEM LETS THREE MINISTERS GO: BARRA AND CAMILION PRECEDE 
CAVALLO AS DISCONTENT GROWS

 The loss of two cabinet ministers in one week may suggest that President 
Menem has grown careless, after years of standing by his lieutenants through 
thick and thin. There are those who believe his willingness to sacrifice 
first justice minister Rodolfo Barra and then defence minister Oscar 
Camilion had something to do with finding sacrificial victims to placate a 
public grown tired of his government.

 Barra ostensibly went because his right-wing nationalist past caught up 
with him -though, as our sister publication, Latin American Weekly Report, 
pointed out at the time, he had also become an inconvenience for economy 
minister Domingo Cavallo (see WR-96-28). Within days, Cavallo had gone, too.

 Camilion's departure, on the other hand, had been on the cards for many 
months. But Menem insisted he would not sack him unless he was charged with 
wrongdoing in connection with the illegal sale of arms to Ecuador during 
last year's border conflict with Peru.

 That moment came when judge Jorge Urso decided there was enough evidence of 
a cover-up by Camilion to justify requesting the lifting of his ministerial 
immunity.

 The air force commander, Brigadier Juan Paulik, said he warned the defence 
ministry that arms apparently bound for Venezuela were probably being

 off-loaded in Guayaquil en route, but the ministry did nothing. And one of 
the suspects in the case, retired army officer Diego Pallares, has,  
according to Clarin, told judge Urso that he bribed people with political 
connections 'at the highest level' to secure permission for the arms to be 
shipped to Ecuador.

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 ARGENTINA/ Bombing probe. Judge Juan Jose Galeano, investigating the 1994 
bombing of the Amia Jewish community centre, in which 86 people were killed, 
has ordered the arrest of four former policemen suspected of providing the 
explosive device used in the attack. He has also hinted at the existence of 
a cover-up involving the Buenos Aires police force and Carlos Telleldin, the 
only person so far to have been indicted. Judge Galeano, who says he has 
received death threats, claims to have solved 70% of the case.

 Falklands' oil rush. Six international consortia have bid for oil 
exploration licences in waters off the Malvinas/Falkland Islands. The 
bidders include a Lasmo-led consortium; a joint venture between British Gas 
and Argentina's YPF, and a partnership between Dutch Shell Exploration BV 
and Italy's Agip. Bids have been made for 10 of the 19 tranches representing 
an area of 44,000 sq km surrounding the islands. But industry observers have 
pointed out that the bids have been made on the assumption that Argentina 
and the UK will reach a cooperation agreement over the disputed waters.

 Best quality of life. The level of human development in Argentina remains 
the highest in Latin America, according to the latest UN development 
programme report. It ranks the country 30th in the world, closely followed 
by Costa Rica (31st), Uruguay (32nd) and Chile (33rd). The index takes into 
account education, life expectancy, health and other factors considered 
important for 'quality of life'.  

 Flood alert. Environmental protest groups have criticised the plans to 
build the Parana Medio hydroelectric dam, which they say will cause 
flooding, alter the local climate and provide a breeding ground for new 
diseases. The authorities argue that the project will lead to cheaper 
electricity, create 10,000 jobs and improve communications between Santa Fe 
and Parana, as a result of the construction of a new bridge. The plans for 
the dam have been drawn up by Energy Developers International of the US.

 Patents row. Deputies from across the political divide have rejected 
comments made by US ambassador James Cheek roundly condemning the country's 
record on the protection of intellectual property rights. The government 
insists that the new patents law, which was approved four months ago, is in 
line with GATT rerquirements. 

 UK trade up. Exports to the UK reached US Dollars 155.8m between January 
and May, a year-on-year increase of 29%. During the same period imports from 
the UK increased by 13%, to US Dollars 176.1m.

 CHILE/ Coal strike drags on. The 1,800 striking miners at the Lota coal 
mine have for the fourth time rejected the agreement reached between union 
leaders and the government. The miners, who have been out since 17 May, are 
demanding improved compensation for the 450 workers who would be laid off 
under the government's rationalisation plan. 

 Pension funds. The Magister pension administrator is to invest US Dollars 
12m in a similar fund in Mexico, in alliance with Banco Alianza. The move 
anticipates the creation of a private pension system in Mexico on 1 January 
1997. Magister executives say they are attracted by the potential of the 
Mexican system, given the country's workforce of 22m. The company currently 
controls US Dollars 400m, 1.6% of the total held in AFPs.

 Top wines. The country has become the region's biggest wine producer, 
according to experts from the agronomy faculty of the Universidad Catolica, 
participating at the International Wine Fair of the southern hemisphere, 
recently held in Santiago. In 1995 wine exports totalled US Dollars 181.7m 
compared with US Dollars 12.6m in 1986, and the industry is aiming for US 
Dollars 500m by 2000. The main importers of Chilean wine are the US, Canada, 
the UK, and in Latin America, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and Paraguay.

 PARAGUAY/ Rebel without a clause. The legal defence team for former general 
Lino Cesar Oviedo, who is in prison on charges of rebellion, has renewed its 
efforts to secure the release of its client, despite the decision of Judge 
Jorge Borgaran to turn down an earlier appeal. Oviedo's lawyers argue that 
the charge of rebellion can not apply to only one person. 

 Population growth. The fertility rate stands at 4.5 per woman, the highest 
in Latin America, which has an average of 3.2, according to the Centro 
Paraguayo de Estudios de Poblacion. The survey was carried out among 6,472 
women aged 15-49, between October 1995 and February this year. 

 Welfare weaknesses. Access to social security benefits is denied to 81% of 
the 4.1m population, and the proportion of those excluded is rising, 
according to a study by the planning ministry. Around 70% of the system's 
beneficiaries live in or near to Asuncion.

 URUGUAY/ Binational pipeline. Work will begin in November on the gas 
pipeline from the Argentine province of Entre Rios, according to Eduardo 
Ache, president of the state oil company, Ancap. The gas will be piped to 
the coastal cities of Salto, Paysandu, Fray Bentos and Mercedes.

 Overvalued land. Land in the municipality of Colonia is overvalued by as 
much as US Dollars 3bn as a result of the plans to build the bridge over the 
River Plate, according to the transport and public works ministry. The land 
is at present in private hands, and so will have to be bought by the 
government at a high price. Work on the bridge, which will link the city of 
Colonia with Punta Lara in Argentina, is due to begin towards the end of 
next year.
