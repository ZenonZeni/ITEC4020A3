NEW MEASURE FOR INDENTIFYING LATIN AMERICAN CONSUMER SEGMENTS

Identifying appropriate consumer segments for specific products
and services is not always an easy thing to do in Latin America.
In these emerging markets, consumers' tastes and purchasing power
can differ widely from country to country, and even from city to
city within a country.

Enter the Socioeconomic Allocator  (SEA), a measure of consumer
socioeconomic status developed by The Gallup Organization, Miami,
Florida. SEA measures variables of occupation, education, type of
building material of the home, and ownership of an automobile and
selected durable goods.

Gallup's study identifies eight distinct consumer segments within
the Latin American population. These segments fall into the three
categories of upper class--emerging professional elite and
traditional elite; middle class--progressive upper middle, self-
made middle, skilled middle, and self-skilled middle; and working
class--industrial working class and struggling working class.
Following are descriptions of one segment each of the upper, the
middle, and the working class.

*UPPER: Of the two upper socioeconomic segments identified by
Gallup's SEA, the emerging professional elite accounts for 14
percent of the total sample population.

This group is highly educated--51 percent has graduated from
university or technical college. They are employed in top-level
executive and professional occupations. Surprisingly, this segment
is very young--65 percent are under 40 years old, and single--45
percent.

These consumers are most likely to own the durable goods that
represent the good life. Over 90 percent own a VCR, color
television set, automobile, washing machine, and vacuum cleaner.
Eighty-nine percent own a credit card.

When it comes to new products or services, this is the market to
target. Thirty-two percent of the members of this segment own
cellular phones.

Entertainment is another big spending category for this group--
over 60 percent list dining, dancing, and going to the movies
among their interests; 48 percent are interested in buying
records. Although sports do not rank high on their list of
activities, 26 percent express interest in swimming, 18 percent in
tennis, and 17 percent in boxing.

*MIDDLE: The self-made middle class (11 percent of the total
population) has the most buying power. Higher education is not a
key factor in the success of this group. None of the members of
this segment has any schooling beyond the secondary level; the
majority completed only primary school.

Instead, the members of this group built their way to success
through entrepre-neurial skills, as is evident in their relatively
older age--40 percent are over age 40.

Of the four middle-class segments, this group has the highest
level of ownership of credit cards--46 percent--and automobiles--
81 percent. Household appliances such as a vacuum cleaner and
washing machine are more common among this segment, and the
presence of air conditioning is more likely.

Sixty-one percent of these consumers express interest in
activities with their children. This translates into a market for
children's toys and clothes. This group also likes to shop for
small electronic appliances.

For entertainment, nearly 60 percent like dining, 48 percent like
going to the movies, and 45 percent like driving. When it comes to
sports, 51 percent prefer soccer, but 23 percent named swimming
and 21 percent boxing.

Religious activities are also important  to this group, as
reported by 46 percent.

It's important to note that although the progressive upper-middle-
class and the skilled-middle-class segments do not currently have
the purchasing power of the self-made middle class, they do
reflect the growing trend in Latin America of greater emphasis on
extended education.

*WORKING: The industrial working class represents the better
consumer market of the two working-class segments. Half of this
segment is between the ages of 20 and 39, and one- third are age
40 and older. Fifty-seven percent are married.

Extended education is not the norm for this group. Only 16 percent
has more than a secondary education.  Twenty-four percent has a
secondary school education, and 29 percent only a primary
education.

While 92 percent own color TV sets, listening to the radio is as
popular as watching television. Nearly half enjoy going to the
movies, but going shopping, especially for clothes and jewelry,
are favorite pastimes with well over half of this group, as are
decorating and cleaning the house.

Religious activities figure prominently in the lives of this
segment. Eighteen percent also mention interest in keeping a
personal diary, the highest share of all eight segments.

FREQUENT FLIER PROGRAM TAKES FLIGHT

With the wave of privatization of government-owned companies
sweeping Latin America during the 1990s, many Latin American
airlines were launched into open markets. In order to compete more
effectively--especially with large United States' airlines--and to
attract frequent travelers, several airlines joined together to
create LatinPass, a frequent-flyer program. By banding together,
these airlines can offer travelers service and frequent flier
miles to more Latin American gateways and flights between the
United States, Canada, and Latin America than any one U.S. airline
can offer.

LatinPass started in January 1995 with 14 South and Central
American airlines and U.S. Air as participating members. The
company's processing center in Miami, Florida, handles enrollment
for all LatinPass frequent fliers living outside Latin America. To
avoid duplication of miles, LatinPass keeps a database of the
frequent-flier programs for each of the participating airlines

LatinPass has invited Caribbean airlines to join, and  BWIA of
Trinidad, APA of the Dominican Republic, and Air Aruba are
currently negotiating agreements with the program. Eventually,
LatinPass hopes to expand to include all Latin American airlines
that fly into the United States and to expand participation to
European and Asian airlines flying into Latin America as well.

Hertz and Avis car rentals, Diners Club International charge card,
and Radisson Hotels currently participate in LatinPass. Avis and
Radisson offer miles at any of their Latin American, Caribbean,
North American, and European outlets.

Mariott Resorts International is expected to join in the near
future. AT&T is also negotiating membership with plans to offer
miles for points in their True Rewards program as well as to
develop a co-branded calling card.

WINES LOSE OUT IN THE ALCOHOLIC DRINK MARKET

The market for alcoholic drinks in Latin America increased 11
percent over the 1990s, but beer is clearly the alcoholic
beverage of choice in the region. In 1994, beer accounted for 80
percent of the sales volume of alcoholic drinks for the major
Latin American markets, according to Euromonitor International.
Wines and spirits accounted for the other 20 percent.

Beer sales are generally driven by demographics. Men aged 18 to 24
are traditionally the big beer market, and that age group is still
growing in Latin America; but young Latin American women are
drinking beer as well. In addition, the region's young adults tend
to use beer as much as a thirst quencher as an alcoholic beverage.
Other factors influencing beer sales are the region's rising
disposable incomes, increased advertising, and beer's low price
compared with other alcoholic drinks. While the alcoholic drinks
market will continue to grow through the rest of the decade, beer
sales will gain even more of the market share--83 percent by
Euromonitor's estimates.

Per-capita consumption of beer varies by country. Venezuela, for
example, averaged 78 liters per capita in 1994, the highest in the
region despite its relatively small population size. Mexico's
large population, on the other hand, consumed only 36 liters per
capita that same year.

When it comes to volume, Brazil and Mexico are the leaders, with
sales of 5,994 million liters and 4,207 million liters,
respectively, in 1994. These two countries will continue to
dominate the market in sales volume through the rest of the
decade--not surprising, given their large populations. As for
ranking in the global beer market, two Latin American countries
are among the top ten--Mexico ranks 7th and Venezuela 8th.
Colombia ranks 14th.

There are some niche markets within the overall beer market. Dark
beer, for example, is a popular seasonal drink, with the greatest
amount of sales and consumption occurring during the winter
months.

Not only is Latin America a key market for beer consumption, it is
also a key beer producer. Of the twenty largest beer brewers in
the world, six are located in Latin America and account for over
11 percent of the total world beer production.

Even as beer consumption is increasing, the market for other
alcoholic beverages--wines and spirits--is declining. Even in
Chile, where wine has long been a traditional alcoholic drink,
beer sales surpassed wine sales in 1994. Only Argentineans
continue to drink more wine than beer--42 liters to 31 liters per
capita. However, when Latin Americans do order wine, they are
likely to order a better-quality wine. Both these trends--less
wine consumption but of better-quality wine--will continue through
the rest of the decade.

While these trends point to a healthy market for beer sales, don't
be surprised to see a counter trend emerge encouraging less
consumption of alcoholic beverages as awareness and concern about
alcoholism develops.

OPINION POLL HIGHLIGHTS CONCERNS OF LATIN AMERICANS

In June of 1995 the Latinobarometer completed its survey of eight
Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

More than 9,000 respondents aged 18 years and older were asked to
identify the main problems their countries face socially,
economically, and politically. A range of economic problems were
identified by respondents--inflation, low salaries, and poverty.
Their responses offer marketers a better picture of the overriding
worries and concerns influencing consumer attitudes and purchasing
behaviors.

In Mexico and Venezuela, 27 percent and 31 percent, respectively,
named inflation as the biggest concern for their country. Twenty
percent of Uruguayans and 18 percent of Chileans were concerned
about low salaries.

Not surprisingly, poverty is viewed as a major problem in several
countries, and was mentioned by 16 percent of respondents in
Paraguay, 13 percent each in Peru and in Chile, and 12 percent in
Brazil.

Despite economic concerns, a significant share of respondents in
Chile and Brazil also put health concerns on the list: 11 percent
in Chile and 19 percent in Brazil.

The 1990s has been a time of major changes in Latin America as
countries shift from closed economies, often tightly controlled by
the military, to open, market-oriented economies with many
formerly government-owned businesses now privatized. Yet, the
Latinobarometer survey shows that, in the minds of the people,
things change slowly. Most Latin Americans still see their
governments, rather than the budding corporate structure, as
wielding the most power. And in some countries, the military is
still seen as more powerful than business.

For example, more than one-half of all respondents in Mexico and
Peru named the government as more powerful than either big
business or the military. This is not surprising in view of the
recent events in those countries, where economic policies and
decisions made by the governments have had an immediate and
dramatic effect on the business environment. In Venezuela and
Brazil responses were more evenly distributed among the three
choices. In Paraguay, 61 percent of respondents said the military
held the most power.

Respondents in Argentina saw things in their country completely
differently. Only 14 percent saw the military as having more power
than either the government or big corporations, but 61 percent
said big business was the most powerful.

Although this was the first Latinobarometer survey in Latin
America, it follows the long tradition of the Eurobarometer in
Europe. For more information on Latinobarometer, see Market:Latin
America February 1996 or contact Hector Casanueva or Marta Lagos,

DON'T OVERLOOK MEXICO'S FOOD MARKET

Despite Mexico's economic problems over the past year, caused by
the devaluation of its peso in late December 1994, the country
offers an unparalleled opportunity for food marketers, reports
PROMAR International, a strategic marketing and business
consultancy. Demand for processed food, which was just beginning
to grow before the peso devaluation, will return, PROMAR
International predicts. This, along with Mexico's growing
population, will make market conditions ideal for processed-food
manufacturers. But in order to be successful, manufacturers must
be willing to enter the market now, and stay in it for the long
term.

Although Mexico's current food chain--production, distribution,
and consumption--is highly fragmented, government economic
policies and market and industry influences will help to
streamline it and make it more efficient.

Demographic factors will also force the system to become more
efficient. More women entering the work force will put a premium
on time and convenience just when disposable income is rising.
Furthermore, the extensive U.S. influence through television and
advertising, as well as the presence of U.S. and multinational
companies operating in the country, will educate the consumer to
more choices in brands, services, and values.

The costs of entering the market now may seem formidable,  but
they are likely to rise over the next few years. PROMAR suggests
that food manufacturers may want to form partnerships with
domestic companies or simply buy a domestic operation.

For more information on the opportunities and challenges offered
by this market, order The Food Market in Mexico: Development After
Devaluation (cost GBP7,500). Contact Zoe Hamilton, Head of
Business Development, PROMAR International, Northcroft House, West

WHERE BRAZILIANS GO, CAN JAPAN BE FAR BEHIND?

Ties between Brazil and Japan are likely to strengthen in the next
century, predicts  Ricardo Sergio de Oliveira, director of the
international division of Banco do Brasil. In an interview with
the Japanese newspaper Nikkei Weekly, Oliveira says the new
century is likely to see a proliferation of business, industrial,
and cultural alliances between the two countries.

Brazil's wealth of natural resources and Japan's technology can
work together to the benefit of both countries. Recently, Japan's
Export-Import Bank provided a loan to finance Japanese exports to
Brazil. In addition, many Japanese companies are making use of
Banco do Brasil's services at its outlets in Tokyo and Hamamatsu.
Although the bank provides loan and deposit services for the
150,000 Brazilians of Japanese nationality living and working in
Japan, nearly one-half of its banking activities come from
Japanese businesses.

Brazil's connections with other Asian countries such as Hong Kong,
Singapore, and China are developing as well. Oliveira sees this as
an extension of the growth and development Brazil will experience
over the next century.

NO PAN-REGIONAL TREND IN LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS

The global rise of VCR ownership and video movies, and of
satellite and cable television over the past few decades put a
dent in movie audiences. With the introduction of multi-plexes,
which offered better-quality sound and pictures, and provided
bright, modern surroundings, movie attendance started to pick up
again. The early 1990s actually saw a surge in movie attendance in
many parts of the world, especially in some emerging markets in
the Asia-Pacifc region, while in most of the developed countries,
movie attendance continued on a downward slide.

Movie attendance in the seven major markets of Latin America is
mixed, but it has not returned to the level of the mid-1980s.

Film Distribution International: Rights and Markets, a resource
book published by Baskerville Communications Corporation, tracks
the trends in the cinema industry as well as in video movie
rentals, and the penetration of cable, satellite, and pay-TV. The
book provides information on over 50 countries throughout the
world, including the seven major consumer markets in Latin
America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and
Venezuela.

In Brazil, for example, movie attendance in 1985 was 91 million
but slid slightly to 90 million in 1990. It then climbed to 95
million in 1991 only to drop precipitously in 1992 to 73 million.
In 1994, movie attendance was once again on the rise in Brazil,
reaching 78.5 million by that year's end.

Argentina experienced a similar curve in cinema attendance,
although the levels of attendance in the 1990s were less than half
those of the 1980s. From 52 million in 1985, movie attendance in
1990 dropped to 25 million. Attendance bottomed out in 1991 at
14.7 million, then began a slow climb.  Although numbers for 1994
are not available, by year end 1993, cinema attendance was
definitely on the rise, with 22 million movie-goers recorded for
that year.

On the other hand, cinema attendance in Mexico, Chile, and
Colombia has been steadily declining.

Despite the unpredictable trends in cinema attendance in Latin
America, advertising in cinemas has steadily increased (although
cinema advertising represents only a small portion of overall
advertising in the region). In Argentina, revenues from cinema
advertising were almost five times as much in 1994 as in 1991. In
most of these seven countries, however, the increase in revenues
for cinema advertising is not as high.

AFFORDABLE PRICES, QUICK SERVICE DRIVE FAST-FOOD SALES IN CENTRAL
AMERICA

People in Central America are interested in convenience and
willing to pay for it. Over the past five years, the number of
fast food outlets in Honduras, Guatemala, and Costa Rica has
increased significantly. In El Salvador, new marketing formats
such as convenience stores are a big success. For example, after
adding convenience stores to their gas stations in El Salvador,
Esso Automarkets saw total sales increase 96 percent, with fast
food becoming a best-selling item.

A research study conducted by Panorama Internacional in Central
America indicates that over a period of five years the number of
fast-food outlets in Honduras tripled while the number in
Guatemala doubled. According to this study, Central Americans like
pizza, hamburgers, and fried chicken much in the same way that
Americans do. And the success of fast food in this region is due
to the same factors that make it successful up northQfast service
and a variety of food alternatives at affordable prices.

Both multinational and local companies compete in Central
America's fast-food market. Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and Burger King
are the dominant multinational companies. Together they account
for 78 percent of the fast-food outlets in Costa Rica and for 21
percent of fast-food outlets in Guatemala. In Honduras,  Pizza Hut
and Burger King account for 36 percent of the fast-food outlets.
Other multinational fast food companies competing in Guatemala,
Costa Rica, and Honduras include Wendy's, Taco Bell, Domino's
Pizza, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway, and Wimpy's.

As for local companies, there are at least 12 large companies in
those three countries, of which Pollos Campero and Bigos are the
most important competitors in terms of number of outlets. Pollos
Campero is present in Guatemala and Honduras, with 38 and 6
outlets, respectively, and Bigos is an Honduras-based company with
11 outlets.

Fast-food competition is greatest in Guatemala and least in Costa
Rica, where there are only seven companies with a total of 63
fast-food outlets. Honduras has nine companies with 83 outlets,
and Guatemala's 173 outlets are owned by just 15 companies, 8 of
which are local companies.

According to Panorama Internacional, multinational companies
target the middle-to-high-income consumer, while local companies
focus more on the mass market.

Menus offered by local fast-food companies revolve around local
tastes and preferences, while multinational companies tend to
stick to their menus offered worldwide. However, some of the more-
successful multinationals in Central America have found that
modifying their menus to incorporate local dishes pays off. For
example, gallo pinto, a typical breakfast dish in Costa Rica, is a
popular addition to some fast-food menus.

In addition, some multinationals have adapted marketing strategies
to the local needs of each country's consumers. For example, Pizza
Hut offers the Executive Discount Card, a membership program which
gives employees from participating member companies significant
discounts on meals eaten at Pizza Hut restaurants. Since it is
common practice in many Latin American countries for employers to
subsidize their employees' mid-day meal, this discount plan meets
the needs of employers and employees.

There is no doubt that the fast-food market in Central America is
growing. Those interested in this market will want to assess the
level of competition and the competitors, both multinational and
domestic companies, in each country. In addition, the ability to
be flexible and  to adapt the product to the local tastes of each
country, and to design marketing strategies geared to the needs of
the local market, will go a long way to ensure success in this
fast-growing fast-food market.

JAMAICA: CARIBBEAN POWERHOUSE IN THE MAKING

Jamaica is poised to become a key business market in the
Caribbean. This achievement has come about over the past few years
as a result of the government's commitment to making Jamaica into
a market economy with a strong private sector.

Policies are now in place to spur economic growth and attract both
domestic businesses and foreign investors. Among these policies
are changes in taxes and customs tariffs. Since the election of
prime minister Percival J. Patterson in 1993, many government-
owned businesses have been privatized, including NCB Bank and Air
Jamaica, the national airline. Other privatizations have occured
in airline services, telecommunications, hotels, and sugar and
banana companies. Privatization of the state-owned petroleum
corporation, PETROJAM, and railway, Jamaica Railway Corporation,
is in process.

These changes and the government's commitment solidify larger
changes that have evolved in Jamaica over the past few decades.
Once an agriculture-based economy that relied on exports of sugar
and bananas, Jamaica's economic base has shifted twice--first to
mining and then to services.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, mining of bauxite and alumina
for export replaced agriculture as the major economic activity. In
more recent years, the service sector, including tourism,  has
taken the economic lead, boasting the largest growth.

The service sector now accounts for 55 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), while the goods-producing sectors--
agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction--contribute
only 45 percent of GDP. Between 1990 and 1994, banking and
communications services nearly doubled, and tourism increased
steadily, earning Jamaica the title of top Caribbean destination,
according to International Travel Trade Gazette.

Jamaica's official language is English. The country gained
independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, although its
government structured itself as a parliamentary democracy in the
tradition of the United Kingdom. But intense political party
rivalries within the country since then have overshadowed
Jamaica's government.

Jamaica still faces some problems.  The robust growth experienced
throughout the 1980s slowed in the 1990s to just one percent
annually. The country's dependence on imports and the slow growth
of exports are major problems.

Inflation and currency depreciation also pose problems for
Jamaica, although inflation has seen a steady decline in recent
years. In 1994 inflation was about 27 percent, down from 30
percent in 1993. By the first quarter of 1995, inflation was 3.4
percent, down from 8.1 percent for the same period in 1994. As of
October 195, the Jamaican dollar exchanged at about J$37 to US$1.
Jamaica also has a heavy foreign-debt burden.

Crime is on the rise and, to some extent, has dampened tourist
interest in the country.

RELIANCE ON IMPORTS
Historically, Jamaica's economic structure was organized to
produce industrial raw materials for export while consumer goods
were imported. In recent years, Jamaica has tried to correct this
imbalance but, as yet, the range of goods produced locally is
limited, and imports continue to grow. Exports of goods and
services averaged only 59 percent of GDP in 1994, while imports of
goods and services were 64 percent of GDP during that same year.

Apparel is one export that has seen significant growth in Jamaica.
Since 1989 apparel exports to the United States increased 60
percent, according to LA/C Business Bulletin.

Alumina, bauxite, sugar, and bananas accounted for over 60 percent
of total exports of approximately $1.2 billion in 1994. Jamaica is
the world's third-largest producer of bauxite, which remains the
country's largest export. In 1994, bauxite production reached its
highest level since 1980. Production for 1995 will be considerably
less, however, due to a strike over wages early in the year that
interrupted production at nearly three-fourths of the country's
bauxite refineries.

Sugar and sugar products, bananas, citrus, coffee, cocoa, spices,
and rum have long been Jamaica's major traditional agricultural
exports, but, except for coffee and rum,  their total production
has declined.

Jamaica relies heavily on imports of both consumer goods and
production resources. Total imports exceeded $2.1 billion  in
1994, of which 63 percent were raw materials and intermediate
goods for further processing. The rest are consumer goods, meaning
Jamaica is a good market for all kinds of consumer goods. Most of
Jamaica's imports come from the United States, followed by
Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

Emigration helps slow growth
Jamaica's population of 2.4 million has grown slowly over the last
few years, at about 1 percent annually. Slow population growth is
due to declining fertility and to emigration.

The total fertility rate (TFR) in 1995 was 2.4 children. The
average TFR for the Caribbean region is 2.9. (Total fertility rate
is the average number of children born to a woman during her
lifetime.) Yet, despite a low fertility rate, Jamaica's population
is young. Thirty-three percent is under the age of 15. In
countries with a large proportion of youth it is unusual to have a
significant share of the population in the older age group. Yet,
in Jamaica, eight percent of the population is over age 65.

The reason for this unusual juxtaposition of young and old
population is the high level of emigration from Jamaica. An
estimated 20,000 young and middle-aged adults leave Jamaica each
year to pursue education or employment in other countries, often
not returning to Jamaica until retirement.

In addition, Jamaica attracts a number of retirees from other
countries who choose to spend their golden years in the Caribbean.
Jamaica's group aged 65 and older, which includes both Jamaican
and foreign retirees, is made up in part of consumers with
comfortable incomes, well-developed consumer tastes, and specific
needs to which marketers can cater.

HOUSEHOLD REMITTANCES ARE IMPORTANT
Jamaica is quite rural. Although urbanization is increasing at
about 1.4 percent a year, only 53 percent of the population
currently lives in urban centers. Somewhat surprisingly, the 1982
census data showed greater numbers of females than males in urban
centers.

Average household size in Jamaica is about 3.8, down from 4.2
persons in the 1982 census.

GDP per capita, a rough estimate of household purchasing power,
was about $1,565 in 1994, although this number is distorted by the
continued depreciation of the Jamaican currency. Actual GDP per
capita has grown by only about $50 since 1989. However, the true
level of disposable income is higher since, in many households,
income is supplemented by remittances sent from family members
living overseas. In fact, remittances sent home to Jamaica have
surged, according to the Economic and Social Survey of Jamaica
1994. Private transfers, the largest share of which is
remittances, reached $214 per head in 1994.

The Jamaican Survey of Living Conditions 1993 shows an average
annual per capita household expenditure of about J$23,408 (US$716
at 1993 rate of exchange), a decline in real terms compared with
1990.

Levels of consumption vary considerably among income groups. The
top 10 percent of income earners spent 12 times more on
consumption than did the bottom 10 percent. Sixty-six percent of
all households spent less than J$8000 (or US$245) per month in
1993.

Consumption expenditures also vary by region. Per capita
expenditure in the Kingston metropolitan area, where 33 percent of
the population lives, exceeded the country average by 31 percent
in 1993. Per capita consumption was lowest in the rural areas,
where 47 percent of the population live.

Spending on food accounts for 54 percent of total consumer
expenditures. Clothing and footwear account for nearly 12 percent
each, and fuel, household supplies, and transportation for
approximately 6 percent each. However, household food consumption
is augmented by home production, from gardens or farms. In fact,
home production accounts for 5 percent of overall food
expenditures. Home production accounts for a larger share of
consumption in rural areas, the food-producing areas. Root crops,
tubers, fruits, vegetables, and poultry are dietary staples.

Although in some Caribbean and Latin American countries it is
common to have well-to-do households side by side with very poor
households, this is not the case in Jamaica. The wealthy and the
not-so-wealthy live in distinct neighborhoods, although in some
areas one drives through the poorer neighborhoods to reach an
affluent neighborhood. Around the Kingston metropolitan area, for
example, many wealthy people live in the hills, middle income
people live in the lower areas, and poor people live in the
flatlands.

CONSUMER MARKET
United States culture has a strong influence on Jamaica's culture.
Jamaica is just an hour's flying time from the United States, and
economic relations between the two countries are centuries old.
The flow of people between the United States and Jamaica further
accounts for this strong influence.

Tourists from the United States account for about 60 percent of
the nearly 1 million annual stopover visitors to Jamaica. Also,
tens of thousands of Jamaicans have migrated to the United States
over the years, and emigres from Jamaica to the United States
typically move back and forth. Jamaican students return after
years of living in the United States, and so do many retired
workers. U.S. goods are also dispersed by hundreds of travelers
returning to Jamaica with large boxes and suitcases brimming with
articles to be sold through informal distribution channels.

U.S. media have perhaps the strongest influence of all. The
Statistical Yearbook 1994, published by UNESCO, reports about 330
thousand television sets licensed or in use in Jamaica during
1992, most tuned to U.S. stations despite the availability of
several hours of local programming. Satellite dishes are
everywhere--on rooftops and dotting the landscape, especially in
the more affluent neighborhoods.

Radio is even more prevalent with over 1 million radio sets in the
country. Three newspapers are published daily and numerous foreign
magazines and newspapers are also available.

All of these media carry advertising for businesses and consumer
goods. Advertising agencies, both local and foreign-owned, abound
in Jamaica. The 1994/95 telephone directory for Greater Kingston
lists 67 advertising agencies and counselors, including
internationally known McCann-Erickson.

Consumer goods, whether imported or domestically produced, are
sold in modern supermarkets and malls, boutiques, and hotel gift
shops. Goods are marketed through billboards, radio and talk
shows, and sponsorships of beauty contests and sports events. U.S.
fast-food chains have franchise outlets in Jamaica, including
Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut,
Domino's, and Popeye's.

As in the United States, the use of credit and debit cards is
growing rapidly.

Telephone penetration is increasing, and in 1994 there were nearly
400,000 lines. Use of cellular phones is also increasing rapidly
with the number of cellular phone customers approaching 25,000 in
1995. Fiber optic equipment is speeding communications between
cities and rural areas and facilitating international
communication, making it ever easier and more economical to do
business in Jamaica.

LABOR FORCE
The labor force currently exceeds 1 million workers, about 44
percent of the total population and 68 percent of persons aged 14
and over (the working age in Jamaica). Female labor force
participation rates are high. Forty-one percent of women aged 14
and above are in the labor force, compared with 47 percent of
males. Jamaica's work force is well-educated and highly skilled.
The literacy ate is 98 percent. Nearly one-quarter of the work
force has some education beyond secondary level, according to
Craighead's International, Business, Travel, and Relocation Guide
1996-97, although only 4 percent have actually graduated.
Approximately 6 percent have vocational degrees. Use of
professional titles, such as Doctor or Professor, is considered
good business manners.

Unemployment is a problem in Jamaica, and women and young persons
are the hardest hit. While overall unemployment was 15 percent in
1994, the actual unemployment rate for males was 10 percent and
for females, 22 percent. Worse yet, according to Labor Force
Survey, 48 percent of those unemployed in October 1994 were
workers between the ages of 14 and 24.

Government "downsizing" through privatization accounts for some of
this unemployment--the government work force was cut by over 20
percent. Data from the Statistical Institute of Jamaica shows
employment increasing across all categories, and there has been a
steady increase in jobs in the private sector, especially in
services and in self-employment. But for workers in agriculture
and fishing, jobs are decreasing due to a decline in manufacturing
output and agricultural exports.

Direct labor costs are low by U.S. standards. In 1994, the average
hourly wage of workers in businesses with 10 or more employees was
approximately J$37, or less than $1.15. Wages are generally even
lower in establishments with fewer than 10 employees. Even so,
wages have kept pace with Consumer Price Index increases over the
last few years.

According toLA/C Business Bulletin, the government no longer sets
wage guidelines for the private sector other than the minimum
wage. In 1995, the minimum wage was increased from $J350 to J$500
per week, or from US$10.54 to US$15.05 (with the exchange rate of
J$33.22 per U.S. dollar at that time).

Although Jamaica's work force is literate and skilled, the
government is emphasizing the importance of higher and technical
education to cope with increasing labor market technology.
Despite an otherwise disciplined economic plan with limited
expenditures, the government is allocating about 10 percent of its
total spending in the 1990s to education.

Enrollment at post-secondary institutions, including the
University of the West Indies, has increased despite
implementation of a student cost-sharing plan. As a further
emphasis on the importance of technological training, the College
of Arts, Sciences, and Technology (CAST) was converted into the
University of Technology (Jamaica U Tech). Current enrollment is
over 6,000.

INFRASTRUCTURE
Jamaica has natural harbors, many of which cater to transport and
cruise vessels. There is specialization among the ports, however.
Cruise ships stop at Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and Port Antonio.
More than 50 percent of all incoming cargo is handled at the Port
of Kingston. Most of the outgoing cargo is loaded at ports other
than Port of Kingston.

Many international shipping lines maintain offices in Jamaica, and
others are represented by various steamship agencies. Over 14
million tons of cargo were transported in and out of Jamaica in
1994. Transshipment cargo--cargo entering the country temporarily
en route to other countries--represented nearly 12 percent of
total cargo movement in 1994 and is growing rapidly.

Air traffic is served by two international airports, one located
near Kingston on the southeast end of the island, the other near
Montego Bay in the northwest. The latter airport serves most of
the tourist resort areas and accounted for two-thirds of passenger
arrivals in 1994. Fifteen foreign airlines fly in and out of
Jamaica, in addition to Air Jamaica.

THE FUTURE
In 1994, Jamaica implemented its National Industrial Policy, a
plan to upgrade the country's infrastructure to better accommodate
increasing economic activity. All ports and airports will be
upgraded, and new port transshipment facilities will be built to
take advantage of the boom in transshipment service. Construction
of a new airport terminal in Montego Bay is already underway.

The 1995-96 fiscal year is the last one during which Jamaica is
covered by an International Monetary Fund borrowing agreement.
Jamaica's economy appears to be stabilizing, although it has grown
only slightly since the start of the decade.

International reserves have grown substantially, and foreign
currency can now be obtained from banks and cambios reducing the
level of black-market activity.
