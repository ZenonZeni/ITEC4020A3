<CENTER><B><I>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF JOINING THE GAME</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<BR>
<B>I.</B>     Thou shalt talk to thy lawmaker -- especially before the session when<BR>
     plans get made.<P>
<B>II.</B>     Thou shalt have thy lawmaker and legislative aides draft a good bill and<BR>
     introduce it early in the session.<P>
<B>III.</B>     Thou shalt keep tabs on which committee is debating the bill and visit<BR>
     undecided committee members, write letters, or call them on the phone to<BR>
     offer thy thoughts.<P>
<B>IV.</B>     Thou shalt volunteer to testify at a hearing -- real-life stories deeply<BR>
     impress lawmakers -- and thou shalt be prepared to outlast long delays.<P>
<B>V.</B>     Thou shalt not expect thy meagerly paid lawmaker to buy lunch -- try the<BR>
     cafeteria for healthy food below capital city prices.<P>
<B>VI.</B>     Thou shalt not believe that public marches around the Capitol sway votes,<BR>
     but do ask sympathizers to write letters and visit lawmakers.<P>
<B>VII.</B>     Thou shalt not bother lawmakers while they are in committee or on the<BR>
     chamber floor and thou shalt be polite -- angry threats and shouting<BR>
     matches never help.<P>
<B>VIII.</B>     When watching legislative action from the public galleries, thou shalt not<BR>
     break rules against taking photographs, eating food, or reading<BR>
     newspapers.<P>
<B>IX.</B>     When thy bill passes and goes to thy governor, thou shalt visit, write, and<BR>
     call him or her with concrete reasons to sign it into law.<P>
<B>X.</B>     Upon success, thou shalt send thank-you cards to lawmakers, lobbyists,<BR>
     and others who helped.</I><P>
<I>CEC thanks CASE Executive Director Jo Thomason for this information.</I>
