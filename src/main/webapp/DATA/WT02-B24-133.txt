Distribution of diagnoses for 100 children consecutively referred to the
outpatient Pediatric Behavioral Neurology Program at the Children’s
Medical Center of Dallas (only 99 children are represented because one
child with affective illness, primary disorder of vigilance, and learning
disability did not fulfill criteria for ADHD). The mean age of the group
was 10.3 years (range, 5 years 5 months to 18 years 9 months), with 73
boys and 27 girls. Racial distribution of the population was 93 white,
six black , and one Oriental, and all were of at least middle-class
socioeconomic status. A large number of the children had more than one
specific diagnosis (comorbidity of disease and all ADHD (inner circle)
could be explained by one or more of the specific entities of affective
disorder, primary disorder of vigilance, and learning disability.
