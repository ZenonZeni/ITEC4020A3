<p align="center"><b>Police, Protesters Clash At Florida Hemp
Rally<br>
Legal Marijuana Smoker Arrested For Pot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 9, 1995, Gainesville, FL:</b>&nbsp;
The sixth annual Florida Hempfest was marred by a greater police
presence than ever before and a record number of arrests --
including that of marijuana activist and legal medical marijuana
user, Elvy Musikka.&nbsp; Musikka, who is supplied by the federal
government with a monthly prescription of marijuana cigarettes to
treat her glaucoma, was dragged off the stage arm-and-arm by two
police officers after lighting one of her prescription &quot;joints&quot;
on stage. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Musikka was initially charged with possession of cannabis and
disorderly conduct.&nbsp; Her lawyer, Gary Wainwright, later
announced that the rally's organizers would take legal action
against the city for false arrest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hempfest organizer, Kevin Aplin, noted that the police presence
at the event was both threatening and excessive.&nbsp; &quot;I'm
sure the police intimidation discouraged some people from coming out,&quot;
he told <i>The Gainesville Sun</i>.&nbsp; Longtime hemp activist,
Jack Herer, also stated that he felt the behavior of the
Gainesville police officers was the worst that he had ever seen
at an event. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nine total misdemeanor arrests were reported overall. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Anti-Drug Group's Attack On </b><a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html"><b>Hempilation</b></a><b>,
WBCN, Draws Fire From National Writers Union, Boston Coalition
For Freedom Of Expression</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the NORML benefit CD <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>, the
National Writers Union and the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression have issued statements condemning the actions of rally
organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both groups are highly critical of the overall nature of the
protest and specifically of the alleged use of state power and
finances to help institute the rally.&nbsp; Reports from the
December 1 gathering note that protesters arrived in state
vehicles, attendees were encouraged to &quot;bring their squad cars,&quot;
and an individual identified as a Boston liaison to the DEA
accompanied Georgette Wilson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D.,
as she entered the station.&nbsp; &quot;These sort of actions,
when performed [and sponsored] by government agents, are
specifically [prohibited] by law,&quot; charges <a
href="mailto:billdown@usa1.com">Bill Downing</a>, president of <b>NORML</b>'s
Massachusetts chapter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a letter to Governor William Weld from the National Writers
Union, Political Issues Chairman Robert B. Chatelle urges the
governor to demand Ms. Watson issue a formal apology for her
actions.&nbsp; The letter further urges Watson to &quot;pledge in
the future to abide by the laws [and] the U.S.
Constitution.&quot; If the executive director is unwilling to do
this, the National Writers Union suggests that Gov. Weld request
her resignation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are concerned ... that you have not yet spoken out
against this abuse of power committed in your name,&quot;
Chatelle writes.&nbsp; &quot;The voters of the Commonwealth have
the right to hear from you about this disturbing event.&nbsp; I'm
sure you have no wish to advance your political career by trampling
on the inalienable rights of the people.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A press release issued by the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression also casts stern consternation on the event and calls
the protest an &quot;astonishing example of the power of the
state riding roughshod over the Bill of Rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The news blackout on this matter, which should at the very
least result in the resignation of Ms. Watson and the
disciplining of the DEA agent who accompanied her into WBCN, is
almost as scandalous as the incident itself,&quot; concludes
James D'Entremont, Director of the Boston coalition. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Missouri Senator Pre-files Medical Marijuana
Necessity Defense Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 14, 1995, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp;
State Senator John Moseley has pre-filed a bill (Senate Bill 573)
for the 1996 session of the Missouri General Assembly that would
provide certain marijuana users with a medical necessity
defense.&nbsp; Sen Moseley is the former President of the
Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill states that &quot;no criminal or civil penalty shall
apply to any person for the act of possessing marijuana provided
that ... a [physician] certifies in writing that the person is
under professional care ... [and] ... needs marijuana as part of
a therapeutic regimen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Dan Viets, President of Missiouri NORML, views Moseley's
bill as a step in right direction and does not forsee significant
political opposition.&nbsp; &quot;Given the fact our legislature overwhelming
supported a resolution to end the federal prohibition of
marijuana as a medicine in 1994, we feel that Moseley's bill has
an excellent chance of passing in the Missouri General Assembly,&quot;
he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is appalling that in some states, juries are forbidden
to hear testimony regarding the medical uses of marijuana,&quot;
says <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;It is even more appalling that individuals who consume
marijuana for its therapeutic effects are prosecuted under our
nation's policy of 'zero tolerance.' Senator Moseley's
legislation would allow for some needed compassion in America's
war on marijuana consumers.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Charges Dropped Against Shop Owner Who Sold
Shirts That Parodied DARE Logo</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 8, 1995, Pomona, California:</b>&nbsp;
The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office dropped
charges against store-owner Mark Hornaday for selling T-shirts
parodying the DARE logo.&nbsp; Hornaday had been cited on a
complaint by DARE America for selling shirts bearing the DARE
logo with the statement: &quot;I turned in my parents and all I
got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot;&nbsp; He was charged under a
rarely used criminal law forbidding the counterfeiting of
copyrighted logos.&nbsp; Hornaday's T-shirts were also
confiscated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hornaday was defended by <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member
William Panzer, who argued that the law was unconstitutionally
broad in failing to distinguish between legitimate free speech
and intentionally deceptive marketing practices intending to
mislead customers.&nbsp; &quot;No one was going to think those
were really DARE T-shirts,&quot; argued Panzer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pomona assistant district attorney Richard Jenkins said that he
chose to dismiss the case because &quot;the people from DARE
would prefer that the [trade]mark be protected by a civil
action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since when does DARE call the shots at the DA's
office?&quot; Panzer replied sarcastically. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hornaday faced a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $5,000
fine on four separate counts if convicted.&nbsp; It is unclear
whether DARE America intends to press further, civil litigation
against Hornaday. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Republican Task Force Organized To Analyze,
&quot;Get Tough&quot; On Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Pronouncing the current administration's anti-drug policy to be
&quot;in utter disarray&quot; and citing recent findings that
indicate 48 percent of the high school class of 1995 has tried an
illegal drug, House and Senate Republicans have organized an
eighteen man task force to examine the drug issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's time to get tough with this stuff,&quot; said task
force co-chair, Orrin Hatch (R-UT).&nbsp; Hatch criticized the
nation's current anti-drug strategies as not focusing enough on
interdiction and law enforcement.&nbsp; The task force announced
that it will issue a report in March. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recent studies demonstrate that drug use among high school
seniors is steadily climbing upward.&nbsp; The annual University
of Michigan study discovered that teen drug use rose for the
third year in a row, but cautioned that America's current
adolescent use rates still remain far below the peak period of
the late 1970s and early 1980s. <br>
