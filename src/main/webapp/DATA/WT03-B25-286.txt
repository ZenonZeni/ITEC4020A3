<BR>
The phenomena of Greenhouse Climate Change, the Loss of Biodiversity, and
Sustainable Landuse are, and will remain the focus of natural resource management
for the foreseeable future, at regional, national and global scales. <BR>
<BR>
These three phenomena are linked by landcover, the cover of vegetation and
soils, and so fundamental is this linkage that the dynamic attributes of
landcover structure, functioning and composition are, and will remain essential
components of all environmental assessments and forecasts. <BR>
<BR>
Such is the nature of these three phenomena, that comprehensive and quantitative
assessment and monitoring of their extent, severity and dynamics of their
impact on landcover can only be based on information derived from Earth
observation data. <BR>
<BR>
Therefore, the development and application of techniques to assess and monitor
the relevant landcover attributes using Earth observation data becomes the
focus of the Global Change Project. <BR>
<BR>
The nature of landcover is determined by soil and climatic factors; it is
influenced by the dynamics of climate and atmospheric composition; and it
is transformed by landuse. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, landcover will not only respond to climatic, atmospheric and
landuse change, the impact, it can also influence future climates, atmospheric
composition and landuse, the feedback. <BR>
<BR>
All three components are inextricably linked, and the interactions are critical
to predictive understanding. <BR>
<BR>
Global Change is defined as the reciprocal interaction of Climate- and Landuse
Change with the landcover component of the Terrestrial Biosphere. It addresses
the interaction of social systems (landuse) with natural systems (climate
&amp; landcover). <BR>
<BR>
Global Change is expressed by the dynamics of functioning, structure, and
composition over timescales of decades to centuries, and aggregated over
the spatial scales of landscape to global. <BR>
<H3>Conceptual Framework: Global Change Project </H3>
<BR>
The following framework<B><I> </I></B>links human needs and wants (the fundamental
drivers of change) through landuse and landcover change to Greenhouse Climate
Change, Sustainable Landuse (Land Degradation), and Biotic Erosion (Loss
of Biodiversity). <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
The interactions are: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Landuse-landcover transformations and conversions; <BR>
<BR>
(2) Enhanced Greenhouse Effect; <BR>
<BR>
(3) Trace Gas Feedback on the Climate System; <BR>
<BR>
(4) Nitrogen &amp; CO2 Fertilisation Effect; <BR>
<BR>
(5) Boundary Conditions Feedback on the Climate System; <BR>
<BR>
(6) Climatic Determinant of Landcover; <BR>
<BR>
(7) if negative, then Land Degradation ; <BR>
<BR>
(8) Net Change in Functioning (eg. NPP), Structure (eg. biomass) or species
composition (eg. Biotic Erosion). </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
There is appreciable remote sensing research being directed to quantifying
the interactions listed above. This effort will continue to grow, nationally
and globally. <BR>
<H3>Defining statements: Global Change Project </H3>
<BR>
Vision: To quantify the uncertainties of Global Change. <BR>
<BR>
Strategic research objectives: <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>- </B>to engage the big issues and articulate over-the-horizon
thinking in the scientific questions not yet being addressed but which will
define prospective research and data requirements; <BR>
<BR>
<B>- </B>to derive landcover functioning, structural and composition attributes
from remotely sensed data using measurement models and data integration;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>- </B>to apply and validate methods to detect and interpret change in
derived landcover variables; <BR>
<BR>
<B>-</B> to develop continental-scale landcover assessment and monitoring
capability and capacity with which to detect and interpret the progress
of Global Change; <BR>
<BR>
<B>- </B>to document and publish all generated datasets. </BLOCKQUOTE>
