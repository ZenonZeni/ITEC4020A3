<H3></TD><TD valign=top cellpadding="15"> <FONT size=4>There's more to successful
solid-waste disposal than &quot;picking up the garbage.&quot; It has to
be done in a manner that satisfies not only the individual customer, but
also the community and the environment.<BR>
<BR>
At Corvallis Disposal, our service includes regular garbage pick-up, recycling,
and several types of specialized containers and services. We strive to employ
the latest equipment and handling methods for safe, and efficient removal
of solid waste.<BR>
<BR>
In the &quot;perfect&quot; waste-management system, there would be no waste;
every article of refuse could be reclaimed, just as in nature. Corvallis
Disposal will always aim for that level of efficiency, and we welcome your
suggestions for improving our service.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </H3>

<H2>Regular Can Service</H2>
Our regular service is collecting one can per residence once a week - unless
otherwise directed. Either permanent, temporary or off-schedule pick-up
service may be arranged by calling during regular business hours. <BR>
<BR>
We require a metal or plastic container (preferably metal), with handles
and a close-fitting cover, also with a handle. The container should have
a maximum capacity of 32 gallons and a loaded weight not exceeding 60 pounds.
Overweight cans constitute a hazard to the person lifting the load; therefore,
we assess an extra charge. 
<H2>Residential Cart Service</H2>
Beginning April 1, 1996, we will offer a 35-gallon garbage cart, available
to Corvallis, Adair Village, and Philomath city residents, with a few areas
excepted. These carts are collected using an 'automated' truck, and consequently
must be placed at the curb for collection. Corvallis Disposal provides the
cart at no additional charge, and will provide replacements or repairs to
the cart as needed.<BR>
<BR>
Collections begin at 7:00 am, so it may be convenient for you to set your
refuse out the evening before pick-up day.<BR>
We appreciate the placement of cans for quick, safe access. Also, please
keep pets secured on pick-up day.
