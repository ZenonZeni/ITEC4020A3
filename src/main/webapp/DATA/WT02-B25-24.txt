	Testimony supporting the relaxation of encryption export laws as put forth
	in S.1726, The Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996, or "Pro-CODE"
	<p>

	June 12, 1996
	<p>
	Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak
	to you today.
	<p>
	I am here to support "The Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996",
	referred to as Pro-CODE.
	<p>
	Let me begin by introducing myself.  My name is Aharon Friedman.  I am the founder,
	chairman and chief technology officer of Digital Secured Network Technology, of DSN.
	Established in 1995 with headquarters in New Jersey, DSN develops and markets
	encryption and authentication solutions for open network communications, such as the
	Internet.  My previous positions include scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratories,
	senior researcher at SAIC, and professor of electrical engineering at the University
	of Maryland.  I received my Ph.D. Summa Cum Laude in Physical Electronics from
	Tel-Aviv University.
	<p>
	I am here today to discuss how Pro-CODE benefits American cryptography companies
	by relaxing laws that restrict the export of American encryption products.  By
	relaxing these export laws, this bill allows American companies such as DSN to
	compete on an equal footing with foreign competitors.  Loosening these restrictive
	laws dramatically improves our competitive position in both international and
	domestic markets.  Yet Pro-CODE supports American companies without jeopardizing
	national security.  Existing export laws are impractical and unenforceable and
	need to be reevaluated in light of the availability of advanced technologies.
	<p>
	As you probably know, encryption is accomplished by scrambling and de-scrambling
	data with a numeric key.  this encryption process makes it extremely difficult
	and time consuming for anyone other than those with the correct keys to recover and 
	read the original text.  The more sophisticated the mathematical formula and the
	longer the key, the better a product will defend computer systems and information
	against an attack.  According to a recently released report by a panel of leading
	security and cryptography experts, to provide adequate protection against serious
	threats, keys should be at least 75-bits long.&#185;
	<p>
	<font size=4>
	Effect of Existing Export Laws on American Companies in the International
	Market
	</font>
	<p>
	By law, American companies can only export security solutions with a maximum
	key length of 40-bits.  This level of encryption does not in any way provide
	adequate protection against attackers.  The report cited above found that widely
	available $400 computer chips enable hackers to break 40-bit keys in five hours.
	A company spending $300,000 could find the right 40-bit key in an average
	of 0.18 seconds.  Clearly, a 40-bit key solution is not a viable encryption
	product.
	<p>
	Existing laws do allow American companies to export DES encryption products
	with 56-bit keys providing foreign clients are willing to place part of the 
	key in escrow with a third party.  Despite the additional strength of a
	56-bit key, foreign clients will be reluctant to purchase these products
	since expert calculations show that DES is cheaper and easier to break than
	previously thought.  With a $300,000 investment in computer network
	equipment, a legitimate or illegitimate business could find a DES key in an
	average of 19 days using off-the-shelf technology.  With this same
	$300,000 investment, using a custom developed chip, a key can be found
	in 3 hours.  For future reference, I have included a matrix that provides
	more details on the vulnerability of 40 and 56-bit key encryption solutions.
	<br>
	(See <a href="#MATRIX">matrix</a> at bottom of this page).
	<p>
	Please keep in mind, these numbers only refer to the keys used to encrypt
	data (cipher key lengths).  Keys that are exchanged between parties, or
	public keys, require a greater key length.
	<p>
	It's clear that the 40 and 56 bit key encryption will not adequately 
	protect electronic communications.  Foreign companies will not want
	to buy these products.  In order to survive, American companies will
	bypass these laws and develop their products in foreign countries.
	This would be a tremendous loss for America's economy.  A recent study
	commissioned by a group of high-tech CEO's (Computer Systems Policy
	Project) estimates that the opportunity loss to US companies as a
	result of current export policy restrictions in the next four years is
	$60 billion and the loss of 200,000 jobs many of which are high-skill
	and high-paying.
	<p>
	On a personal note, DSN has a steady stream of requests for product information
	frmo foreign companies.  We have also had a number of meetings with a major
	Japanese company interested in evaluating uor security solution for several
	large installations.  This company is attracted to our product because of
	its advanced use of a 512-bit key.  However, under existing export laws,
	the product's strength becomes a liability.  If these policies are not
	changed to allow the export of competitive encryption products, we will
	clearly lose this lucrative contract to a foreign competitor.
	<p>
	<font size=4>
	Effect of Export Laws on the Domestic Market
	</font>
	<p>
	Export restrictions threaten to lock American companies out of our own
	domestic market as well.  Advanced American encryption products can be used
	by an American company, for example IBM, to secure communications to another
	American company.  Yet IBM will not be able to use this same product to secure 
	communications with foreign companies.  For two parties to encrypt their data 
	transmissions, they must use the same keys and protocols at both ends.  
	Under current export restrictions, a foreign company would not be able to 
	encrypt messages to IBM if IBM used a high-end American encryption product.  
	Faced with this dilema, IBM may choose to buy its security product from a 
	foreign company that can sell its products unrestricted on a global basis.
	<p>
	As a matter of fact, NTT has quietly begun selling a powerful data-scrambling
	chip (Triple DES) and has already made sales in 15 countries, including in the
	United States.  It just so happens that one of these companies is IBM.
	<p>
	It should also be noted, that under existing laws an American company developing
	a product based on this NTT chip will not be able to sell the product back to 
	Japan, not even to NTT.
	<p>
	In our opinion, American companies will not purchase encryption products developed by
	American companies because it just doesn't make good business sense.  Export
	laws responsible for this predicament clearly need to be changed.  Start-up companies
	such as DSN have better and more powerful solutions available but we are 
	consistently stymied by government restrictions.  Small businesses have enough problems
	without having to deal with senseless government regulations.  All we want is to be
	on a level playing field with foreign developers of encryption products.  
	Senator Burns' bill does just that.
	<p>
	<font size=4>
	Current Laws Do Not Solve the Problem -- Criminal Elements Can Easily Violate Them
	</font>
	<p>
	Due to the availability of powerful computing capabilities, current laws and
	regulations governing American encryption products are impractical and
	unenforceable.  There is at present no way of stopping terrorist
	organizations and criminals from writing, or hiring someone to write their
	own code based on published unbreakable encryption algorithms.  For example,
	I have with me today a widely available book titled, <i>Applied Cryptography</i>
	written by Bruce Schneier.  On pages 637 through 643, Mr. Schneier provides all
	the source code a hacker would need to write a powerful encryption program.
	A hacker would simply need to scan the text on these pages into his
	computer to circumvent existing export laws.  We can safely assume these
	criminals are not going to register part of these keys in escrow with the 
	government.
	<p>
	Thus we are confronted with an unfortunate irony.  While existing laws deny
	adequate ecryption to companies engaged in legal activities, access to more
	powerful encryption solutions remain available for illegal purposes.  In the
	words of Monday's New York Times editorial, "clearly it is time to revise
	Government encryption policy to fit this new universe".&#178;	
	<p>
	Senator Burns' proposal allows American companies to export encryption products
	that match products available in the international arena.  As a representative
	of a business that markets and develops powerful, state of the art encryption
	products, I can tell you that this bill restores America's competitive
	advantage in a rapidly expanding market.
	<p>
	Once again, thank you for the privilege of speaking with you today.  I hope
	my testimony will be of value to the committee, and I would be happy to
	entertain any questions you might have.
