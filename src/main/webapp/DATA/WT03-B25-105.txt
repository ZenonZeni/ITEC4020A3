<P>Ever since I tried to paint bothsides of some shelves at the same time, I 
have never really enjoyed painting. I needed some way to hold the painted 
object up so I could paint both sides. Painters, platers and processors face 
this problem every day. One-pass all-side coating is the most efficient 
process, but cannot be accomplished all the time because of the unusual shapes 
of objects. 
<P>For most applications, the product can be hung from racks, placed in 
trays or loaded on a conveyor. However, when painting spheres, cylinders, 
tubes and other unusual shapes, sometimes a more singular solution is 
required. Expanding a plug into the hole can be the trick that solves two problems. 
The first and most obvious is that the plug seals the hole, preventing the 
coating from entering the item and saving coating material. The second feature is 
that a properly designed plug can be used to hold the coated object from hooks 
or hangers. 
<P>Plating applications face similar problems since there are usually 
some access or drain holes that must be sealed. 
<P>To obtain the proper finish, all plugs and seals need to be compatible 
with the coating materials. This means the sealing device cannot leach any 
material into the bath. All seals meant for reuse cannot be destroyed by 
the process, and, therefore, must be compatible with the temperature and bath. 
<P>For painting and coating applications, most reusable sealing devices 
withstand any commercial paint or powder. However the drying and 
curing processes require that the rubber sealing portion withstand temperatures 
in excess of 400&#176;F. In addition, for applications where the seals will be 
cleaned, it is important that the seal resist acidic cleaners. 


<P>For plating applications, the rubber seal needs to be compatible with 
the applied bath material. Table I presents selections for designing a 
sealing device compatible with your process. 
<P>Table II provides guides that are general recommendations and should 
be tested prior to starting production. All processes should be tested 
using disposable samples. The preferred hardware for sealing devices is 
stainless steel. However, small savings can be realized using zinc-plated steel. 
<P>After selecting the proper material, the requirements for a closure 
mechanism need to be addressed. For pressure seals, a hex nut or handle should 
be used to ensure adequate closing pressure is applied. For repetitive 
processes, a snap-action cam can be used to allow quick insertion and removal. 
The variety of closure styles is unlimited and usually designed right on the 
plant floor. 
<P>When selecting a sealing device, all parameters must be reviewed prior 
to selecting the material. The best material may not be discovered until 
after several trials. For example, while silicone is an excellent 
high-temperature material if used in a threaded hole, it may split frequently. By examining 
the sealing materials beforehand, one can avoid calamities on the 
production line.     <B>PF</B></P>
