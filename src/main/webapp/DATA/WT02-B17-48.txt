<b>U.S. DOE Hydrogen Program<br>

                Working Group and Annual Review Meetings<br>

                          April 29-May 2, 1996<br>

                                Miami, FL<br>

At our spring Working Group Meeting, we began with a discussion of the 
upcoming DOE solicitation

for hydrogen technology validation projects.  The Department of Energy 
(DOE), under authority of

Section 2026 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486, and 
the Matsunaga Hydrogen

Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990, Public Law 
101-566, is requesting

applications as a follow-on to a Notice of Interest published in the 
Commerce Business Daily (on

April 21, 1995).  DOE is seeking private-sector led, cost-shared 
projects in research, development,

and technology validation that include the integration of hydrogen 
technologies such as production,

storage, transport, and end-use applications.  The purpose of the 
solicitation is to assist the private

sector in the development of integrated hydrogen systems for 
applications to near- and long-term

markets.  DOE encourages the submission of development plans for 
integrated systems related to

long-term hydrogen energy markets, although DOE will consider 
applications for systems addressing

near-term hydrogen niche markets.  The request for proposals is expectd 
to be issued in June, 1996.

A series of plenary lectures followed, on an issue of great importance 
to industry and the program -

transferring our technologies from the lab to the marketplace.  A 
diverse and exciting panel was

assembled for a lively and informative session.  Mr. Joseph King, vice 
president of Technology and

Business Development for International Fuel Cells, discussed his 
experience in transferring

technology from the development phase to commercialization.  Air 
Products and Chemical s Robert

Miller presented an informative discussion of the industry perspective 
of partnering with DOE.  Gary

Noland, president of G & A Associates, gave his perspective on 
small-business involvement in

technology development.  Finally, Clyde Feyrer, president of First 
Colonial Funds, provided us with

an overview of existing financing mechanisms and presented an 
interesting concept for capitalization

of technology development projects.
<p>

Following the plenary session on Monday, the individual working groups 
met in breakout meetings

for most of Tuesday.  Each of the group leaders (Production, Storage, 
Utilization, and Systems

Integration) arranged an agenda that continued the theme of the plenary 
as it applied to specific

technology areas.  In the late afternoon, we reassembled as one group to 
discuss several proposed

demonstration projects and their applicability to the Hydrogen Program 
goals.  
<p>

On Wednesday, we began our Annual Review Meeting, which is the primary 
peer-review mechanism

used by the program to maintain the highest level of quality in our 
research and analysis efforts.  We 

began with a discussion of the mechanics of the meeting by Neil 
Rossmeissl, DOE Hydrogen

Program Manager.  Following introduction of the review panel, four 
technology summaries were

presented.  Because the program is growing so large (more than 50 
projects), we conducted parallel

sessions this year; these technology summaries afforded an opportunity 
for the reviewers and

attendees to get a flavor of the entire program.  Finally, we heard 
about exciting outreach activities,

including hydrogen at the Olympic Games.  The parallel sessions began 
after lunch on Wednesday

and concluded on Thursday afternoon.  The recommendations of the peer 
review panels are

expected in June, 1996.
