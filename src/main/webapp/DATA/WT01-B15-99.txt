Last month, I moaned about the debacle of Cartaway Resources, the one time "New Bre-X," roaring to the stars with investor's money as rocket fuel. Suddenly Cartaway fell 90% in value, as investors realized that the actual assay results were merely one tenth of the visual estimate that caused the rocket motors to ignite. Cartaway, that powerful metals exploration play that ironically made garbage receptacles last year, has been eclipsed by another jewel from the East, Timbuktu Gold. Timbuktu's rocket crashed not on bad assay estimates, but on complete fraud. A certain Mr. Oliver Reese of Timbucktu Gold was suddenly exposed as having a list of securities infractions going back for about 30 years. You may remember Mr. Reese from the mid-80's as the promoter of a scheme to 'rework' King Solomon's Mines. All these escapades have shook the faith of the "punters," who will believe anything at the top of the markets, and believe nothing at the bottom.<p>The Vancouver Stock Exchange has been in a tailspin, as "investors" bailed out and TV reported that promoters like Murray Pezim were at risk of losing the third fortune of their lifetimes. This selloff also affected the (more senior) Toronto Stock Exchange indices. The blue chip-oriented TSE 35 did better than the broadly based TSE 300. The small cap Canadian mutual funds were hurt badly.<i> BPI Canadian Small Companies</i> manager Steve Misener was in the office about three weeks ago and he described his strategy for the next couple of months. His intention was to liquidate junior plays to raise a 25% cash position in July. He hoped to buy back at bargain prices. According to <i>BPI Canadian Small Co's</i> chart, the fund is down about fourteen percent and I don't know how much liquidation he may have done. On the other hand, he's still up over 47% for the past year. That's a good year by anyone's standards.<p>Despite all of the negativity out there, the TSE 300 is still operating in a long term uptrend. Watch for a close below 4850 on the TSE 300. If this occours it will signal the beginning of a negative trend. <b>On an intermediate term basis, the TSE is oversold, setting the stage for a surprise rally.<p></b>Finally, if you thought that no one in Canada is making money these days, you'll be amazed to know that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police-our beloved Mounties-are starting to make money on their souvenir marketing venture with Disney Canada. After surviving the chuckles and Mickey Mouse jokes, the RCMP have netted about $150,000 after the first two months of sales. The money goes to fund community policing projects. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>67</center></body></html>
