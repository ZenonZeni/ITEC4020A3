<font size=5>PHYSICIAN`S  CELLULITE CREME </font><br>

<font size=4>with whole leaf Aloe Vera</font><hr size=4>



                            <center> <b> NEW! DOUBLE STRENGTH FORMULA FOR FASTER RESULTS</b></center><p>

<b>WHY  'PHYSICIAN CELLULITE CREAM'  IS THE BEST</b><br>

Dr. Kemsley's Skin Care  is providing you with a product that was developed through a concerted

effort of dedicated professionals including a Research Pharmacologist, Biomedical Research

Dermatologist and  Cosmetic Plastic Surgeon.  A unique Theophylline is used that is

extremely fat soluble and able to penetrate the skin. We use Theophyline instead of the more

commonly used aminophylline because aminophylline is very unstable with a limited shelf life ,

normally 2 months or less.  This instability causes the product to naturalize, thus many of the cellulite

creams on the market have lost all potency by the time the consumer uses the product.   We

use a derivative of theophylline which is very stable for at least 3 years.  In addition whole leaf aloe

vera is an important part of our formula.  Our patented aloe vera increases lymphatic

drainage and has an anti-inflammatory effect which promotes an accelerated action of the

Theophylline.  These active ingredients are contained in a rich emollient that gives your

skin a wonderfully soft and enriched feel.<p>

<b>HOW IT WORKS</b><br>

Theophylline is a natural product belonging to a group of plant compounds called xanthines, which includes caffeine in coffee and theobromine in chocolate.  The main action of theophylline is to help the normal body processes in mobilizing stored fat.  Fat is energy that the body stores for use whenever there is no food available.  Even when we sleep, the body burns up enough fat to consume 500 - 600 calories.  What particular area of fat used in this process is determined by a complex physiological mechanism, but fat mobilization can be encouraged in specific areas such as thighs or buttocks by direct application of the cellulite cream.<p>



<b>WHOLE LEAF ALOE VERA GEL</b><br>

Aloe Vera has many positive properties.  For example, the anti-inflammatory action of the gel provides versatility to other formulations when compounded with aloe vera.  When used with cellulite reduction products containing Theophylline, aloe vera has the unique action of increasing lymphatic drainage and promoting an accelerated action of the Theophylline. <p>



<b>RESULTS</b><br>

People report seeing results in 7 to 30 days.  They report a softening and smoothing of the areas treated.  You should continue the thigh creme until your desired results are obtained.  If the cellulite starts to reappear, then resume using the product until the cellulite is not visible.<p>
