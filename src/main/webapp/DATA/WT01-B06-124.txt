<P><I><font color="#9F121B"><B>A Guide to Alternative Medicine</I></B></FONT>, an Isis Interactive Library CD-ROM, provides the opportunity to explore the fascinating and rapidly growing world of Alternative Medicine. It is estimated that Alternative Medicine is a $14 billion industry in the U.S. alone.  It is also reliably estimated that fully one-third of the U.S. population has explored alternatives to mainstream medicine for both prevention and therapy.  "Alternative Medicine" is mainstream medicine for more than 80 percent of the world's population.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Thirty-four of the country's 125 medical schools -- including Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins -- now offer courses in alternative medicine.  In 1995, the American Medical Association passed a resolution suggesting that its 300,000 members "become better informed regarding the practices and techniques of alternative or unconventional medicine."  Many of the U.S.'s leading news magazines -- including <U>Time</U>, <U>Newsweek</U>  and <U>Life</U> -- have recently devoted cover stories to various alternative medical treatments.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>In 1991, the U.S. Congress established the Office of Alternative Medicine within the National Institutes of Health.  The first Director of the Office was Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs, a respected and experienced mainstream physician whose Mohawk Indian heritage exposed him early in his life to treatments practiced historically among the Mohawk Indians.  Dr. Jacobs brings a physician's dedication to scientific methods, skepticism of the unproven, but an open attitude to treatments that are not yet considered mainstream therapies.</P>  

<P ALIGN=LEFT> Dr. Jacobs leads the  user through seven alternative medical topics: </P>
