<H3>The Cernavoda Project - Past and Future. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/glodbio.html">Florian Glodeanu</A>, T Campureanu, T Chirica and D Popescu.</H3>


Romania and Canada agreed in 1977 to cooperate on atomic energy, and the CANDU-6 design was chosen
 as Romania's basic plant because of its proven design, operating and safety records, because the use
 of natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as coolant would permit Romania fuel cycle self-sufficiency,
 and because the process equipment would require less investment in manufacturing plant. Engineering,
 procurement and financial assistance agreements were concluded with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL)
 and Ansaldo of Italy for the planned five-unit CANDU-6 station at Cernavoda, 150 km east of Bucharest.
 The project suffered from delays and quality problems with domestic component manufacture, and from
 inadequate project management, due to the immaturity of the nuclear industry in Romania; and also from
 disadvantages of a highly centralised economy and from political decisions.

<P>
After the revolution in 1989 an attempt was made to complete and commission Cernavoda unit 1 as soon
 as possible, and new contracts were signed between AECL and Ansaldo and the Romanian Electricity
 Authority (RENEL). Work progressed well and commercial operation for Cernavoda 1 is scheduled before
 end 1995.

<P>
Electricity demand is increasing in the recovering Romanian economy, and development studies show that
 by 2000 RENEL's available installed generating capacity should be around 21 000 MWe, from modernised
 existing fossil fuel plants and from Cernavoda 2, presently 30% complete. Use of this plant would save millions
 of tonnes of Romania's fossil fuels, and consequent pollution problems due to their high moisture, sulphur
 and ash contents. Completion of Cernavoda 2 is the second step of Romania's nuclear power programme.
 Political support is forthcoming and a financing scheme is being developed. If this is successful, Cernavoda-2
 could be completed in 55 to 58 months. Units 3, 4 and 5 are presently 14%, 5% and 4% complete respectively,
 and they will be preserved up to 2000 to await financing.

<P>
The CANDU system offers benefits which will enable Romania to be self reliant in the nuclear sector. 
Firstly, less uranium will be used than with a comparable LWR, because a CANDU uses natural uranium 
fuel (85 tU annually), and this fuel requirement is met by the Pitesti plant which manufactures 100 tonnes
of CANDU-6 fuel per year, and could manufacture more. Secondly CANDUs can use different types of fuel
 - slightly enriched uranium, recycled uranium, MOX fuel containing plutonium, and thorium fuel. Advanced 
fuel cycles are being developed. A heavy water plant has been built, and reactor components are being
 manufactured. True self-sufficiency requires a waste disposal strategy, and this is based on interim storage
 at the reactor site followed by permanent disposal.
