<H2>About Organic Gardening</H2>
<P>As more and more products labeled "natural-organic" become available today at local garden centers, many gardeners are asking the question, "What is organic gardening?"</P>

<P>People often assume that organic gardening is some kind of fad or gimmick that is the result of the latest environmental concern.  Organic gardening is in no way a new phenomenon, however.  It is a return to the methods of cultivation practiced for centuries.  Organic gardening is a conscious effort on the part of the gardener to reintroduce the cycles and inherent balances of nature back into their gardens.</P>

<P>Organic gardening has several basic principles that provide the foundation for its success:</P>
<UL> <LI> Learn to live with nature, not in confrontation with it. <BR>
<LI>Promote diversity within the garden.  It is through this diversity that nature achieves stability. <BR>

<LI>Grow plants in environments to which they are best suited. <BR>
<LI> Feed the soil, not the plant.  It is the health of the soil that ensures a plant's health. <BR>
<LI>Return to the soil as much as you take out. <BR>
<LI> Think of the garden as a total system. <BR></UL>
<P>Organic gardeners think of the soil as the foundation of a healthy garden.  The soil holds most of the vital nutrients a plant requires for growth.  The soil also serves as the reservoir for the water plants require.</P>

<P>By feeding our soil, making regular additions of organic matter, we create an environment that fosters the growth of healthy, vibrant, and nutritious plants.  Plants are allowed to grow at their natural rate (not pushed along by synthetic fertilizers) and they therefore develop a higher resistance to attacks by insects and diseases.</P>

<P>By creating diversity in our gardens, such as planting flowers in vegetable gardens, we learn to attract beneficial insects and other life into our garden to help us maintain an appropriate equilibrium.  In time we learn to accept a few holes in the leaf, the occasional slug or snail, the presence of weeds, as signs that the garden is healthy, vital, and self-sustaining.  As a result , we are able to vastly reduce the chemical dependency many gardens have unwittingly developed.</P>

<P><A HREF="product.htm">Whitney Farms Organic Fertilizers and Soils</A> provide the gardener with sources of the finest quality fertilizers and soils derived from entirely natural sources.  We have made every effort to produce plant foods that feed and enrich the soil so that the gardener may enjoy the abundance a healthy garden can afford.</P>


<H2><A NAME="fertilizers">About Organic Fertilizers</H2>
<P>Any discussion of fertilizers should begin with at least a brief overview of plant nutrition.  It is commonly accepted that there are 16 elements required by plants for healthy growth.  Of these, three-carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen-are supplied by air and water.  The other 13 are normally absorbed from the soil by plant roots.  This group of 13 is further divided into 3 subgroups: primary nutrients , secondary nutrients, and micro nutrients.  All of these elements are essential, regardless of the amounts required.  They include:

<UL><LI><B>Primary Nutrients:</B> Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
Potassium<BR>

<LI><B>Secondary Nutrients: </B>Calcium,
Magnesium, Sulfur<BR>

<LI><B>Micro nutrients:</B> Zinc, iron, Manganese,
Copper, Boron, Molybdenum, and Chlorine<BR>

<P>All of these nutrients work together in a delicate balance to promote plant growth.  For example, an excess of one nutrient can reduce a plant's ability to absorb another. </P>


<P>The role of any fertilizer is to improve the fertility of the soil.  The soil supports plant life and is the vehicle that supplies the necessary nutrients to the plant.  The more fertile a soil is (i.e. rich in organic matter) the more likely it is to yield a healthy and abundant garden. </P>


<P>Fertilizers are commonly divided into two different categories: synthetic/chemical fertilizers and natural organic ones.  Plants cannot tell the difference between an organic and a synthetic/chemical fertilizer.  The difference between the two types of fertilizers is evident in their impact on the soil. </P>


<P>Organic fertilizers feed the soil, not the plant.  The soil will feed the plant.  Organic fertilizers help maintain overall soil fertility by contributing vital organic matter and enhancing the soil structure in addition to supplying plant nutrients.
They are most often derived from the by-products of once living organisms or from rock powders. </P>

<P>Organic fertilizers are released gradually to the plant.  They actually form a store house in the soil; the plant takes up the nutrients as it needs them.  Soil fertility is maintained and enhanced for the long-term benefit of the garden. </P>


<P>Synthetic/chemical fertilizers are formulated to be fast-acting.  Most synthetic fertilizers are salt or acid-based.  They typically have a higher nutrient grade than do natural organic fertilizers and they are often intended to be immediately available to the plant. </P>


<P>In many cases the plant can only use 10% to 15% of the available nutrients in synthetic/ chemical fertilizers.  The rest is essentially wasted -creating possible harmful side effects and suppressing many beneficial soil organisms.  Soil fertility can be reduced with an excess of synthetic/chemical fertilizer use. </P>


<P><A HREF="product.htm">Whitney Farms Organic Fertilizers</A> are derived from entirely natural sources.  Except for our rock powders, all of our organic fertilizers are by-products that have been "recycled" for the gardener's benefit.  Our fertilizers fit into two categories: fertilizer blends and simple plant foods. </P>


<P>All <A HREF="product.htm">Whitney Farms Organic Fertilizers</A> are derived from natural organic sources (as defined by organic certifying organizations).  We produce plant foods that aid the gardener by feeding and enriching the soil.  A rich soil will produce an abundant garden. </P>
