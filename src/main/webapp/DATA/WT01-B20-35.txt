<p align="center"><b>Update: Judge Considers Permitting Medical
Marijuana User To Smoke Cannabis<br>
While In Jail</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; In what
may end up being a precedent-setting decision, a Williams County
Judge is considering allowing marijuana activist Todd McCormick
to have legal access to medical cannabis while in jail.&nbsp;
McCormick is a medical marijuana user and co-founder of the San
Diego Compassionate Use Club--a facility in California that
supplies free marijuana to seriously ill patients based upon a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He is currently awaiting trial in
Ohio where he faces four felony charges resulting from the
discovery of 31 pounds of cannabis in his vehicle by Ohio State
Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; The marijuana was marked &quot;for
medicinal use only&quot; and McCormick maintains that it was
intended to be used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in his
hometown of Providence, Rhode Island. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At an arraignment last Thursday, Williams County Court of Common
Pleas Judge Anthony L. Gretick suggested that he might order the
Sheriff to allow McCormick to use cannabis while in jail if
McCormick could provide the court with written support by an
American physician.&nbsp; McCormick possesses a prescription from
a physician in the Netherlands that advises for the consumption
of ten grams of cannabis per day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to Gretick's suggestion, three prominent U.S. doctors
(<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.) wrote
letters supporting McCormick's need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
However, according to a Toledo Blade reporter covering the court
proceedings, the judge is now also requesting that a local doctor
be summoned to endorse and administer the prescription to
McCormick.&nbsp; As this report goes to press, no official action
has yet to be taken by Gretick. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case gained national exposure this week when it was
mentioned in an August 21 <i>USA Today</i> editorial endorsing
the use of marijuana as a medicine for seriously sick
patients.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> had a letter supporting marijuana's
medical utility printed in <i>USA Today</i> the following day. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Residents Favor Access To Medical
Marijuana<br>
According To Recent Health Poll</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
recent poll by Mervin Field for the California Center for Health
Improvement indicates that although many Californians still
remain concerned about illicit drug use, the majority of the
state still support the medicinal use of marijuana.&nbsp; This
conclusion directly contradicts earlier statements made by Dr.
Andy Mecca, director of the state Department on Alcohol and Drug
Programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the California Health Poll, 57 percent of the
respondents stated that they favored granting doctors the ability
to legally prescribe marijuana to their patients.&nbsp; By
comparison, only 22 percent favored similar prescriptions for
cocaine.&nbsp; Ironically, cocaine is currently classified as a Schedule
II drug which allows for its medical use in certain instances
while marijuana remains classified by the federal government as
having &quot;no medical use.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>New York City Buyers Club Busted<br>
Apparent Nationwide Crackdown On Medical Marijuana Clubs
Continues</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; New
York City activists have reported that law enforcement officials
recently busted New York City's underground cannabis buyers
club.&nbsp; The New York club was one of over thirty such clubs
that currently operate and distribute medical marijuana to
seriously ill patients.&nbsp; Longtime AIDS and drug reform
activist Johann Moore was arrested at the scene and held
overnight.&nbsp; He is reportedly charged with one count of
felony sales. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bust of the New York City Medical Buyers Club--a small buyers
club that had consciously maintained a relatively low
profile--seems to support the notion that law enforcement
agencies across the country are beginning a concerted effort to
crackdown on medical marijuana clubs.&nbsp; In the past few
months, both Todd McCormick (San Diego Compassionate Use Club)
and Joanna McCkee (Green Cross Patient Co-op of Washington) have
been arrested and had their marijuana seized by law enforcement
officials. <br>
