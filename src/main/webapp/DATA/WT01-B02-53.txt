<TITLE>MESSAGE FROM IEEE/GRSS PRESIDENT</TITLE> 
<H1>MESSAGE FROM IEEE/GRSS PRESIDENT</H1>       
<P>On behalf of the IEEE/Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, I would
like to welcome you to the 1994 International Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Symposium (IGARSSU94).</P>       
<P>  I encourage you to participate in the exchange of technical
information in the form of oral and extended interactive presentations,
and to also take advantage of the informal discussion opportunities
throughout the week -- among these are the reception and banquet to be
held Monday and Wednesday evenings, respectively. New this year is the
opportunity for you to assist in formatting and supporting the SocietyUs
technical positions on issues of concern to the membership through the
IEEE/GRSS Technical Committees. Under the leadership of Chuck Luther,
Office of Naval Research, the first Technical Committee meeting will be
held Wednesday from 12:10 to 1:40 pm in the East-West Room of CaltechUs
Athenaeum -- lunch will be provided at a minimal charge of $10.00 per
person (tickets should be purchased in advance at the registration
desk). Your participation is important to us and to the direction of our
Society.
</P>       
<P> I extend a special welcome to all our international participants
who comprise an outstanding 50% of attendees. Our Society is well
recognized in the IEEE for its broad international participation. I
encourage all fellow IGARSS attendees to continue in your participation.
The next few years will bring the introduction of new and exciting
directions for GRSS and IGARSS. In particular, with IGARSSU94 we have
seen the introduction of Digest materials available in CD ROM format
(eliminating the need for extra luggage to take home bulky volumes).
This practice will continue with IGARSSU95 along with the submission of
abstracts via electronic mail, and IGARSSU96 will introduce an annual
commercial tradeshow to be held in conjunction with IGARSS.          You
will find in your registration packet an extensive evaluation form
covering all aspects of the symposium. Please take a few minutes to
complete this questionnaire -- it will assist future organizing teams to
better respond to your preferences.
</P>        
<P>Finally, we would like to thank JoBea Way, Dan McCleese and the
entire IGARSSU94 Organizing and Technical Committees for all the effort
put forward in organizing an outstanding, well-rounded program.</P>     
   
<P>Again, welcome to sunny Southern California! Enjoy your stay.
</P>
