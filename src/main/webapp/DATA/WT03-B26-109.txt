<H3>The View From Space </H3>
<HR>

<P>
To generate a national assessment of landcover disturbance required
a dataset that was contemporary (1990s), a census sample (100%),
of workable spatial resolution, geocoded, digital, and usable
within the resource constraints of time, personnel and funding.
Such requirements dictated the use of space data: specifically,
digital image data from the multispectral scanner (MSS) instrument
carried by the Landsat satellite series.
<P>
Besides satisfying these requirements, the view from space was
the only view to satisfy the above constraints. It has significant
additional appeal because it is a view that can be readily shared.
Satellite data in image format is an attractive and engaging method
of communication. Images were used where possible within this
document.
<P>
Significantly, the view from space is a powerful view. It is powerful
because it is both synoptic and fine grained. The original source
dataset resolved the entire continental landcover to the level
of 0.001 x 0.001&#176;, approximately 100 x 100 m or one hectare
in area. Unfortunately, with that resolution the data volume became
intractable so a coarser, defocused view, twenty-five times larger
in area (0.005 x 0.005&#176;, 500 x 500 m), was used for most
of the analyses.
<P>
This, and most other details of the methods used in digitally
processing the Landsat MSS are critical to the interpretation
and credibility of the results reported here. The nature and size
of errors detected during data processing and their influences
on the results are discussed next.<HR>
