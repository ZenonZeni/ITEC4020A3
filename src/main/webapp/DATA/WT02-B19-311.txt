<CENTER>The Council For Exceptional Children's<br>
Recommendations for the Reauthorization<br>
of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act<BR>
</CENTER><B><P>
I. OUTCOMES AND EDUCATION REFORM<P>
A.     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Should be Linked to Education Reform Efforts Implemented in Goals 2000: Educate America Act.<BR>
<BR>
Issue:  </B>On March 31, 1994, the President signed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.  The disability community worked diligently to ensure students with special needs would be fully included in education reform efforts, including initiatives involving standards and assessments.  IDEA needs to reflect the linkage between services for students with disabilities and the overall education goals that are applicable for all students.   <P>
<B>Recommendation:  </B>A statement needs to be included in the purposes section of IDEA to reiterate Congress's intent to include children with disabilities in the Goals 2000 education reform programs.  Services available to students with disabilities through IDEA will allow all students to aspire to the high standards set in Goals 2000. <B>     <P>
B.     The Statutory Intent Should be Strengthened to Emphasize that Part B has the Objective of Improved Student Performance Along with the Guarantee of FAPE (Free, Appropriate, Public Education).</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  The provisions of Part B need to place greater emphasis on the objective of improved student performance along with the guarantee of FAPE, with appropriate mechanisms for monitoring outcomes for students.  This change would allow IDEA to run in tandem with the development of voluntary national content and performance standards for all students in the recently passed Goals 2000 legislation.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  Increased emphasis must be placed on outcomes for students receiving the support of special education and supplementary aids and services.  The purposes section of IDEA should be amended to emphasize the need for positive outcomes through the delivery of special education programs/services.  The annual report to Congress on IDEA should also include information on how students with disabilities do after school.   <P>
<B>II.     FLOW AND USE OF FUNDS</B><BR>
  <B><BR>
A.     The National Policy Should be Adjusted to Encourage State Special Education Funding Formulae to be Placement Neutral.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  The Federal government distributes funds for the Part B State grants on the basis of the number of children with disabilities in the State compared with the number of all children with disabilities.  The Federal formula does not differentiate funding based on a child's placement in a regular classroom or in a different setting.  Many States, however, do award funds to local education agencies based on the child's placement.  In some cases, the local education agency is allocated more funding for a child who is in a separate classroom for children with disabilities than for a child who is integrated into a regular classroom.  Unfortunately, this may act as an disincentive for placing the child in the regular classroom.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC strongly believes that State funding formulae should be made to be "placement neutral."  In that context, it should be reiterated that the Federal funding formula is "placement neutral."  IDEA clearly states that to the maximum extent appropriate a child with a disability should be educated with children who do not have disabilities.  To award additional funding for placement of children with disabilities outside of the regular classroom works against the principles of IDEA.  To the other extreme, incentives should not be provided for removal of students from special education programs.  The Federal government should require States to ensure their State funding formula is "placement-neutral" in their State plan.  To do so would not prohibit placements along the continuum. <P>
B.<B>     The Current Federal Formula For Allocating Part B Funds Should Not  be Changed. <BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Issue:  </B>Funds under Part B are currently allocated to the states and to the Local Education Agencies (LEA's) and Intermediate Education Units (IEU's) within each state based upon the relative number of children receiving the support of special education and related services.  This approach was developed in an era when a very large number of children were estimated to be wholly excluded by the schools or inappropriately served without necessary special education support.  Thus, the current allocation arrangement was intended to encourage closing the gap between served and unserved.  An argument can be made that the allocation formula should become service-neutral, i.e. neither promoting nor discouraging the provision of special education services to children.  Proponents of change have suggested, as one approach, the inauguration of a funding formula state-by-state based solely on each state's relative population of all children ages three to 21 years, with a similar approach for in-state allocation.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While CEC is philosophically supportive of changing the formula to a more census-based approach rather than a child count, we oppose changing the formula during this reauthorization.  A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds states receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  There would be some states that would lose funds and other states that would gain.  Thus, CEC believes the possible benefits derived from a formula change do not outweigh the disruption that could occur if formula changes are sought.  We also believe that a formula change may penalize states which have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.  We are further concerned that a census-based formula may lead to an under-count of the population of children in urban areas who are in need of special education services. <P>
<BR>
CEC does recognize, however, the problems with using a formula that relies on a child count.  As more schools attempt to develop  inclusive programs we are seeing the potential for un-intended consequences.  One of the common service delivery models in inclusive schools is the use of co- or team-teaching.  It has been reported that when there is a special educator teaching in a regular classroom, the rate of referrals to special education decreases.  Such an outcome would appear to be both logical and desirable.  However, when funding is based on a child count the consequence of a reduced child count is reduced funding.  When funding is reduced the monies to support the special education staff working in the regular classroom are also reduced.   Clearly there is a need for research in the possible effects that  inclusion has on  reduced referral and thus, a reduction of funds for providing special education services.   <P>
<B>C.     Part B Funds Should Not be Included in "Schoolwide" Programs Authorized Under Title I of the Improving America's Schools Act (IASA).</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  During the IASA reauthorization a proposal was made to include the use of IDEA, Part B funds in the schoolwide programs under Title I.  There are some in the education community who would still advocate amending IASA schoolwide provisions to include Part B funds.  The objective of allowing such funds to be used in a schoolwide program would be to assist special education students through needed schoolwide instructional improvement, with the added objectives of promoting inclusive schools and discouraging unnecessary barriers in the in-school coordination of separate federal support programs.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While CEC recognizes the good intentions of those who would advocate allowing Part B funds to be used in schoolwide programs, we oppose such a move.  The federal government promises states 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) to assist in the costs of educating a child with a disability.  Today, the federal government appropriates only 8 percent of the APPE.  Therefore, with limited funds to provide critical education services to children with disabilities, CEC believes we need to maintain the visible audit trail of Part B funds.  There is a need to ensure that all students receiving the support of special education continue to have full implementation of their IEP's with the limited dollars available.<P>
We also believe, however, there are some unnecessary barriers in the in-school coordination of federal programs.  The audit trail of funds should not be a barrier to serving children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment.  Where funds are used for accommodations and supplemental services "incidental benefit" to other children is something we would expect and fully support.  Such a prohibition against incidental benefit would lead to unnatural boundaries in classrooms where the intention is for students with disabilities to be full participants.  IDEA should be clarified to allow for "incidental benefit" to regular education children.  <P>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><B>III.     ASSESSMENT FOR ELIGIBILITY</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>A.</B>     <B>There Should be a Stronger Link Between Assessment and Intervention</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  P.L. 94-142 and subsequent reauthorizations of the Education of the Handicapped Act, including IDEA, have guaranteed a right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all students with disabilities.  This right has led to an emphasis in federal and state regulations on a categorical model of special education which promotes assessment for eligibility determination and classification.  Although it is imperative to continue this right to FAPE for all eligible students with disabilities, there have been a number of on-going concerns with regard to current policy and practice in the implementation of a categorical model of special education.  For example, assessment to determine categorical eligibility often does not provide information that either identifies student competence or is directly linked to appropriate interventions or supports.  In addition, many assessment measures used to determine categorical disabilities have not been found to be reliable or valid for the purpose for which they are used.  The emphasis of assessment on determination of student eligibility for services also restricts the time that professionals can allocate to other essential activities.  <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:  </B>Changes within IDEA should clarify the purpose and intent of the law to minimize the use of assessments to categorize children within particular categories, and instead to place an emphasis on the determination of eligibility and be based on the educational, emotional, and vocational needs of students and on assessment of student progress.  Changes in the law as well as federal and state regulations could thus deemphasize the current medical model, and clearly support a service delivery system that is driven by the identification of student competence, instructional need, and student growth.<P>
<B>B.     There is a Need to Make Statutory or Policy Changes that More Clearly Support Functional, Curriculum-based, and Performance Assessments.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  Re-conceptualization of the special education assessment process is compatible with key concepts within the general education restructuring movement, accountability, and the increased emphasis on demonstrable student outcomes.  It is also consistent with the knowledge that many of the standardized assessment instruments and procedures being used are not technically adequate for the purpose for which they are being used, nor are they linked to curriculum and instruction.  Additionally, there exist numerous professional concerns regarding the inappropriateness of such standardized tests for culturally- and linguistically-diverse exceptional children.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC recognizes that functional, curriculum-based, and performance assessment instruments and procedures are currently allowed under federal law.   However, there are words and phrases used in the federal regulations that seem to reinforce and support the use of standardized instruments and procedures; e.g., the requirement that tests be valid for the purpose for which they are used, etc.  Perhaps a change in federal law is not needed; however, sometimes a re-statement of purposes of assessment and the range of possible alternatives can be beneficial to shifting "mindsets" and resulting practice.  Rather than making a change in federal law, Congress could clarify the variety of possible assessment procedures in report language.  It would seem important that inquiry regarding the special education assessment process be done at the same time that such inquiry is being carried out with other educational assessment procedures within the school restructuring process.  The emphasis of assessment should be on identifying current functioning levels, educational needs, and assessing the impact of the program and services on students.<P>
<B>C.</B>     <B>There is a Need to Clarify the 3-Year Re-evaluation Process.</B><P>
<B>Issue:  </B>The regulations governing the IDEA require a child with a disability who is receiving special education services to be re-evaluated every three years, or more frequently if conditions warrant, or if the child's parent or teacher requests an evaluation.  Although the regulations do not specify the components of the re-evaluation, they do require the procedures to be based on the initial evaluation procedures.  In practice, this has resulted in some confusion with schools conducting the same numerous assessments they initially administered to the child to find out if he or she was eligible for special education services.  <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC believes every child being served under IDEA should be evaluated for services during the annual IEP process.  The three year re-evaluation, however, has often resulted in unnecessary eligibility testing of children with disabilities.  Time that could be spent on instruction and learning is currently wasted on unnecessary repetitive testing.  The regulations should be clarified to discourage schools from conducting repetitive testing unless specifically asked for by the parents or teacher.  Correspondingly, parents should be allowed to waive any particular test(s) at time of the re-evaluation.  CEC does believe, however, that a more thorough evaluation should be conducted at natural transition points for the student.  We urge Congress to consider requiring re-evaluations to be conducted at these transition points: at the 4th grade level, before entry into middle/junior high school, and before entry into high school.<P>
<B>IV.     DEFINITIONS</B><P>
<B>A.</B>     <B>Additional Diagnostic Definitions Should not be Added to the Law.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  There seems to be a marked consensus in professional educational circles that no new diagnostic categories be added to the definition of the eligible population under the IDEA, with the point being made that more refined diagnoses are not appropriate for an educational law.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  The contention is made that the existing categories are already too great in number, and that any further diagnostic refinements can be accommodated within the existing categories.  Too much time is spent on the sorting process; and further diagnostic categorization runs counter to the inclusive school and community movement, and to the need to focus on the whole child.<BR>
<B><P>
B.     Diagnostic Categories Should not be Required for the Primary     Grades.<P>
Issue:</B>  CEC has a strong preference for removing the federal requirement to report by diagnostic category those children receiving the support of special education.  This may, however, not be the right moment to contemplate moving to a single definition of disability that would apply to all children in determining eligibility for special education support.  We do believe, however, that a strong case can be made for allowing one broad category for the majority of children from kindergarten through the third grade.  The same logic applies which allows the schools to use one broad category for the federal preschool program for children with disabilities.  Namely, diagnostically-governed categorization for most children in their early childhood years is inappropriate and not helpful in determining appropriate instruction.  CEC defines early childhood as birth through age eight, as does IDEA, Part C, the Early Education for Children with Disabilities Program.<P>
The primary grades represent the time when a great many reading and behavior problems begin to develop; at this point they don't require designation of a diagnostic category.  These problems, however, require immediate and effective intervention by trained educators.  An increased focus on effective intervention in the early grades could avoid the need for special education support for many children in the later years.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC recommends that the states be given the option of using for the majority of children ages six, seven, and eight the definition which they now have the option of using for children ages three, four, and five.  <P>
Permit us to quote that definition, Section 602(a)(1)(B) of IDEA:<P>
          (i) experiencing developmental delays, as defined by<BR>
          the State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic<BR>
          instruments and procedures, in one or more of the<BR>
          following areas: physical development, cognitive<BR>
          development, communication development, social or<BR>
          emotional development, or adaptive development; and<BR>
          (ii) who, by reason thereof, need special education<BR>
          and related services.<P>
<B>C.     The Term "Serious Emotional Disturbance" Needs to be Changed to<BR>
      "Emotional or Behavioral Disorder."</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  Use of the term "serious emotional disturbance" has resulted in a number of problems in efforts to serve the population of children who have emotional and behavioral challenges.  "Serious emotional disturbance" is the only one of the ten categories of children eligible to receive IDEA services that includes the term "serious."  Further, the regulatory definition of "serious emotional disturbance" is narrow, based on criteria that have never been supported by research on subtypes of children with emotional or behavioral disorders.<BR>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  If children with disorders of this nature are to be accurately identified, so that they can access appropriate education and services, the term "serious emotional disturbance" must be changed in statute to "emotional or behavioral disorder."  Characterized by behavioral or emotional responses so different from appropriate age or cultural norms that they adversely affect educational performance, "emotional or behavioral disorders" must involve exhibition of inappropriate responses in at least two different settings.  The term "emotional or behavioral disorder" is less demeaning than the current "serious emotional disturbance" and would permit more accurate identification of children and youth with disabilities who require special interventions.  This is also the recommendation of the Mental Health/Special Education Coalition.<P>
<B>V.     PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS</B><P>
<B>A.</B>     <B>The Age for the Entitlement of IDEA Services Should be Clarified.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  Part B of IDEA states special education services must be provided for eligible students who are aged 3 through 21.  It is unclear as to what "through 21" really means.  This has created confusion in the provision of services.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  There is general agreement that a clarification of the eligible age for Part B services is needed.  The regulations should clearly state that the student will be eligible for services through the school year in which the student turns 21.<BR>
<B><BR>
B.</B>     <B>Mediation Should be Required as an Option for Parents Prior to the Initiation      of Due Process Hearings or Court Cases.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  The due process procedures in IDEA provide necessary protections for parents of students with disabilities.  It is often, however, the only recourse parents have available to use in settling disputes with school officials.  This has sometimes led to overly legalistic and costly proceedings.  The due process procedures have in many cases caused some animosity between school officials and parents.  Parents should have the right to choose to have their differences with the school settled through mediation.  <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  CEC believes states should be required to make mediation available to parents.  While mediation is now available to parents in some states, it is not available to all.  By amending IDEA to require mediation be made available, all parents would be allowed to choose an alternative way of settling disputes.  While CEC strongly believes that parents have the right to proceed directly to due process proceedings, mediation should be made available to those who wish to try to work out their differences with the school.  Safeguards, however, would have to be put in place to assure parents who choose mediation that they can proceed to the formal due process procedures at any time.  Parents must also be assured that mediation does not delay the established timetable for resolution of due process procedures.      <P>
<BR>
IDEA may also need the inclusion of Sec. 513 of the Americans with Disabilities Act which reads " Where appropriate and to the extent authorized by law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution, including settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, minitrials, and arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising under this Act."  The inclusion of this provision would help to encourage other means of conflict resolution between parents and schools.      <B> <P>
C.</B>     <B>Parents Should be Required to Meet with School Officials to Discuss Concerns      About the Evaluation Performed by School Officials Before Obtaining an            Independent Evaluation.<P>
Issue:</B>  Under IDEA, parents who disagree with the school's evaluation of a student may obtain an independent evaluation at school district expense if the school district's evaluation has been determined to be inappropriate or discriminating.  Parents' rights to an independent evaluation should be maintained.  However, if the school has an opportunity to address the concerns of parents before an independent evaluation is sought, additional funds may be saved.  In addition, by requiring parents to meet with school officials before obtaining an independent evaluation, parents can be provided an opportunity to air grievances or concerns about the school's evaluation.  A meeting of this nature would also provide school officials with an opportunity to address these concerns, and may prevent the need for an independent evaluation.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  By requiring parents to meet with school officials before obtaining an independent evaluation, schools and parents are provided a chance to work together to address issues regarding the evaluation of a student.  If nothing is resolved during the meeting, parents can still obtain an independent evaluation at school district expense.  Requiring a meeting between parents and school officials facilitates communication between the two parties and may resolve any disagreement.  However, such a meeting should occur immediately when the parents indicate the desire for an independent evaluation, and should not be allowed to delay the parents right to proceed expeditiously.<BR>
<B><BR>
D.</B>     <B>Parental Notification Requirements Should be Streamlined.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  The current parental notification requirements under IDEA require too much paperwork, consume large quantities of valuable instructional time and can act as a disincentive for progressive educational programs.  In addition, current approvable forms (e.g. parental rights, in special education) are too lengthy and often are not readable by the parents.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  By clarifying parental notification requirements, schools would know that they are not required to notify parents every time there is a change in the instructional strategies used to implement the individualized educational program of a child.  Teachers would be allowed the flexibility needed to vary the instructional approaches used to continue the individualization of a child's education program without the bureaucratic disincentives.  Parents will continue to be notified of any change in the child's identification, evaluation, and individualized education plan and placement but they will not be confused by the barrage of documents coming from the school for other related issues.<P>
<B>E.</B>     <B>Schools Should not Have to Reimburse State/Federal Attorneys.</B><BR>
<B><BR>
Issue:</B>  Protection and advocacy for students with disabilities is a necessary and much-needed component of IDEA.  The Federally funded Protection and Advocacy Services (P. & A.'s) that exist in every state provide families with legal representation they might not otherwise be able to afford.  The annual separate appropriation specifically for this legal representation enjoys widespread support from advocates from the disability community.  The issue raised, however, is whether state/federal attorneys, already having been publicly funded, should also be entitled to taxpayer reimbursement of legal fees at the local level.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  For state/federal attorneys to be reimbursed at the local level after already receiving public funds seems to be paying twice for the same service.  With local school districts already strapped for funds, it does not seem fair to reimburse the legal fees of someone already being paid from the public purse.  By changing the statute, schools would not have to reimburse state or federally funded attorneys but would continue to reimburse the costs of private attorneys.  <BR>
<B>F.     The Immediate Refiling of a Hearing Request Regarding the Same Issue Should be Prohibited.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  There is concern that after an expensive and time-consuming due process procedure in which a decision has been made, parents can immediately refile a hearing request regarding the same issue.  This can lead to additional costs and time spent on an issue that the school and the parents have already addressed.  After a hearing officer rules on an issue, neither party should be able to immediately start the process all over again.  Parents are allowed to appeal the decision of the hearing officer and should take this route if they feel the decision is unjust.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  A prohibition on the immediate refiling of a hearing request regarding an issue that was just decided would alleviate the unnecessary time and funds spent to decide the same issue.  IDEA guarantees adequate protection for parents by allowing parents to appeal the hearing officer's decision.     <BR>
<B><BR>
VI.     INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAMS</B><P>
<B>A.</B>     <B>The IEP Should Be Made More Relevant to Parents, Teachers, and the            Learning Needs of Children.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  Is the IEP, as it has evolved, as relevant as originally intended?  Is it a meaningful document that explains the program provided to the student?  Is it a useful document for monitoring student progress?  Is it a useful document for monitoring for state officials? Is it meaningful for parents? Is there real dialogue taking place in the development of the IEP?  There seems to be consensus that the IEP for too many students is no longer meeting the original intent of the framers of the statute and has become cumbersome and, in many instances, meaningless paperwork.  <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  CEC believes that the IEP is one of the cornerstones of IDEA.  An argument can be made that a simplified IEP, which met the original intent of the law, would be more meaningful to teachers and parents.  Such an IEP might also be a more useful document for monitoring purposes and for monitoring student progress.  A revised IEP might also promote the original intended dialogue between parents and school personnel and result in truly individualized instructional programs being developed for students with disabilities.  Of course, this revised IEP would contain the needs of the child, the special education programs and services provided, and the projected initiation and termination of these services. <P>
<B>B.       The Required Components of the IEP Document Should be Changed<BR>
     by Eliminating the Requirement for Short-Term Instructional Objectives.</B><P>
<B>Issue:</B>  When the law and its implementing regulations were originally passed, there was a strong belief that we needed to include in the IEP document not only the current level of a student's performance but also a series of annual goals and corresponding short-term instructional objectives.  There are a number of educators who strongly believe that the current focus on student performance and annual goals remain critically important within the IEP.  However, there appear to be a majority who believe the short-term instructional objectives are not as valuable as originally anticipated and could (and should) be dropped from the statute and regulations.  It appears that both teachers and parents do not gain enough value from the inclusion of short-term instructional objectives to make them worth including in the IEP process, due to the IEP teams' time and effort involved to develop them.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>Recommendation:  </B>Eliminating this requirement will significantly increase the time educators have to be able to teach, while at the same time helping significantly to reduce the labor-intensive paperwork.  Some educators believe eliminating the short-term instructional objectives will improve the communication process between parents and school officials, since they will not be required to focus on the instructional objectives that many parents find confusing and of limited value.  The IEP should focus on the annual goals (written in measurable terms) and a clear articulation on what the special education and related services will be to achieve those goals.<P>
<B>C.     IEPs Need to Specify the Extent of Student Participation in National and <BR>
     State-wide Assessments.<P>
Issue:</B>  Many children with disabilities have been uniformly excluded from participating in the various national and state-wide assessments administered to their non-disabled classmates.  Various reasons account for these exclusions including vague participation guidelines, unwillingness to accommodate exceptionalities, high-stakes incentives for exclusions, and altruistic motivation.  As a result of these exclusions, assessment results are skewed, not accurately portraying the diversity of our school populations.<P>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  The purposes of developing an IEP include team determination of relevant instructional goals and identification of specific educational services needed to achieve the stated goals.  In line with these purposes, CEC recommends the addition of a statutory requirement to the IEP - a statement describing the extent of student participation in national and state-wide assessments.  Those individuals assembled to develop an IEP would be required to consider the appropriateness of student participation, as well as to formalize the accommodations or modifications necessary for each child's assessment administration.  CEC strongly believes that such accommodations or modifications should accurately reflect those provided to the child in his or her daily instructional program.  Addition of this assessment participation statement on the IEP would do much to increase the number of students with disabilities who participate in nation-, state- and district-wide assessments, thus providing the students, the schools, and the public with more accurate data, representative of all children.<P>
<B>D.     The Individualized Education Program (IEP) should be more Family Focused,<BR>
     Particularly for Children in the Elementary Grades.<BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Issue: </B> Family involvement in the provision of special education and related services to children with disabilities has always been an essential underpinning if meaningful results for the student are to be achieved, particularly in the early childhood and elementary school programs.  Special educators have always considered the family members to be their core partners in the special education enterprise.  Further, one of the universal characteristics of school reform across the country has been the movement toward greater parent involvement in the neighborhood school, both from the standpoint of policy and overall monitoring of the school program and from the standpoint of involvement in the instructional program of their particular child.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  One school of thought has been arguing that the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) should eventually replace the IEP for all children.  We do not feel that this would be appropriate policy, since the IFSP focuses on an array of co-equal services and involves multiple agency jurisdiction.  The IEP is school-based and focuses on special education and the necessary related services in order to make that special instruction possible and meaningful.  However, we recommend that the underlying philosophy of the IFSP, which is centered on the strengths, needs, and concerns of both the child <U>and the family</U>, be built into the IEP.  Further, we recommend that recognition of the cultural and linguistic diversity of families become a focus of the IEP, in keeping with the ever more varied tapestry of American families as we enter the 21st Century.<P>
<B>E.     The Teacher(s) who Participates in the IEP Meeting Must Work<BR>
     with the Child on a Regular, Daily Basis.<P>
Issue: </B>Although the regulations clarify that the participants in a student's IEP meeting include "the child's teacher," it appears that in some cases, the teacher who attends the meeting is not necessarily one who has regular, daily contact with the student.  There are a variety of reasons for this, but one commonly cited involves situations where a child is being served in a non- public setting. <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation: </B> In order to best represent the child's present performance and needs, the teacher or teachers who have regular, daily instructional contact with the student must be the individuals who fulfill the teacher requirement for IEP meeting participation.  CEC recommends the addition of a regulatory note further clarifying the selection of the "child's teacher" as one who works with the child on a regular daily basis.  Further, it is important to note that in many cases, more than one teacher may work with the child on a regular daily basis and be familiar with the student's disability.  When and where appropriate, more than one teacher should participate in the IEP meeting, in that multiple sources strengthen the information sharing and decision making process.  However, this recommendation should not be interpreted as requiring all teachers who have contact with the student to attend a student's IEP meeting.  Nonetheless, all teachers having contact with the student should receive copies of the IEP.<P>
<B>VII. CULTURALLY- AND LINGUISTICALLY-DIVERSE POPULATIONS</B><P>
<B>A.     The Annual Report on IDEA Should be Required to Address the Issue of Disproportionate Representation of Children From Diverse Backgrounds in Special Education.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  The question of disproportionate representation of children from culturally- and linguistically-diverse backgrounds, including limited English proficient students, in special education continues to be a major national concern.  Periodic data surveys have shown higher percentages of minority children, particularly African-American children, classified as needing special education services as compared to other children.  However, there is a notable lack of hard data and information on the extent of the over- and under-representation and the causes.  Moreover, there is little available data regarding issues of referral and identification for special education.  The "Special Studies" section of IDEA (section 618) calls for a study that examines "(i) the factors that influence the referral and placement decisions and types of placements, by disability category and English language proficiency, of minority children relative to other children, (ii) the extent to which these children are placed in regular education environments, (iii) the extent to which the parents of these children are involved in placement decisions and in the development and implementation of the IEP and the results of such participation, and (iv) the type of support provided to parents of these children that enable these parents to understand and participate in the educational process."  Unfortunately, this critical study has never been funded and policy makers still do not have necessary data on the numbers and percentages of children from diverse backgrounds in special education programs.  In order to provide information on the issue of disproportionate representation, the <I>Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA</I> should be required to address the issue.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  By funding the study and requiring the <I>Annual Report</I> to include data on representation of culturally- and linguistically-diverse students in special education, federal policy makers, would provide educators and parents with  crucial information on the identification of children with special needs.  Regular annual information on the causes of disproportionate representation could lead to policy/practice changes that will not occur without the necessary data.<BR>
<B><BR>
B</B>.<B>     Additional Federal Resources Must Focus on Improving Instruction and<BR>
     Methodology for Educating Children with Disabilities who are Culturally- and<BR>
     Linguistically-Diverse.<P>
Issue: </B>Children with disabilities who are culturally- and linguistically-diverse have historically been subject to limited, and often inappropriate, instruction and services.  While the few longitudinal studies conducted reveal very poor post-school outcomes, including exceptionally high unemployment for this population, only limited federal resources have been targeted to research, develop, and disseminate information on proven instructional practices and methodology.<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation: </B>In light of the challenge that lies before educators in addressing the unique needs of children and youth with disabilities who are culturally- and linguistically-diverse, CEC strongly recommends the dedication of Federal resources to focus specifically on effective instructional practices.  This could be achieved through competitive preferences in the currently authorized programs or through directed priorities, or through other strategies.  While the need for data collection and statistical/causal research in the area of culturally- and linguistically-diverse children and youth with disabilities is key, so is the development and dissemination of real-life practical strategy and methodology.  Solid, proven strategy and methodology will assure the delivery of a free, <U>appropriate</U> education to those children with specialized linguistic and cultural needs.  If, as the recent Goals 2000 education reform legislation promises, every student is to have a true opportunity to learn, the Federal government must take an active role in contributing to instruction which is appropriate and responsive to the needs of all students, including those of culturally- and linguistically-diverse backgrounds.<BR>
 <B><BR>
VIII. IDEA DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS, PARTS C THRU G<P>
A.       Greater Flexibility Should be Built into the IDEA Support Programs,<BR>
     Parts C through G Without Resorting to Consolidation.<P>
Issue:</B> CEC wishes to affirm the vital role that the support programs operated directly by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) have played throughout the years in providing research, development, and technical assistance which has enriched the special education enterprise and benefited children in many demonstrable ways.  Nonetheless, the contention is made that the support programs have become too fragmented over the past fifteen years, with many individually authorized programs and numerous earmarks within the individual programs.  Some feel that long history of these programs have contributed to substantial variation in activities, terminology, and funding requirements.  It is argued that is difficult for a recipient to assemble a significant funding package necessary to achieve statewide systemic change.  It is further argued that OSERS/OSEP is too constrained in meeting identified national needs by funding limitations, a situation which is further exacerbated by low appropriation levels over many years. <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While CEC acknowledges the theoretical logic supporting a move to consolidate resources from different programs, it is important to examine such proposals from a realistic and historical perspective.  All of the discretionary authorities were established to address a genuine need; many of these needs have not yet been adequately met.  CEC recommends against moving toward an undefined consolidation of these important programs; many of the underlying concerns which support a more consolidated approach can be addressed through less drastic means. <P>
For example, we recommend that applicants be allowed to make joint applications under more than one support program as long as the Congressional intent is met for each of the individual discretionary programs involved in the joint application.  We also recommend making the language regarding eligible applicants, the types of authorized activities, etc. more consistent across the different programs which would encourage a more flexible and coherent approach for those applicants interested in seeking support under more than one program.  <P>
Finally, we recommend that as new funds become available, Congress enlarge the currently very modest authority and provide greater resources to allow OSERS/OSEP to provide individual states technical and other assistance to bring about systemic changes needed to improve outcomes for children.<P>
If, however, consolidation does proceed, CEC believes that the following criteria should apply in all consolidation deliberations:<P>
.     Prioritized need areas represented by the current statutory authorities, where important needs must still be met, should be maintained.<BR>
<BR>
.     Programs with demonstrated effectiveness as they are currently structured should not be restructured simply because change is the fashion of the moment.<BR>
<BR>
.     Any program that is deemed in some quarters to be currently unneeded or ineffective should be thoroughly and objectively examined in its current operation before alteration is proposed.<BR>
<BR>
.     The worthy objective of greater flexibility in addressing immediate and emerging needs should not take precedent over the obligation to earmark resources for populations and activities that would otherwise be neglected.<BR>
<BR>
.     All constituencies served or supported by the current discretionary authorities and sub- authorities should be fully consulted in any consolidation deliberations.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B.     Research Programs must Remain within Jurisdiction of the Office of Special<BR>
     Education Programs.<BR>
</B>     <BR>
<B>Issue:</B>  Research efforts in the education of individuals with disabilities, provided under IDEA, are essential to meeting the goals of the Act.  The research and demonstration projects are unlike some other Education Department research grants, in that the IDEA grants stress practical research, aimed at direct application of the data and knowledge to the delivery of special education, most importantly, at the classroom level.  These programs are administered by the Office of Special Education Programs, maintaining a strong connection between the research and the instructional components of special education and related services.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  The authority for the IDEA research components must remain in the Office of Special Education Programs.  This vital connection between instructional practice and related research must be maintained.  Removal of the research in the education of children with disabilities component from the Office of Special Education Programs would jeopardize the link to applied research connections.<BR>
<B><BR>
C.     An Authority must be Established in Part E: Research in the Education of            Individuals with Disabilities to Support Research-Based Model Demonstration      Programs which Address the Needs of Children with High-Incidence and Single-     Sensory Disabilities.<P>
Issue: </B>The current statute does not provide for development of model demonstration programs which support the translation of research findings into effective practices in the schools for students with high-incidence disabilities (specific learning disabilities) or those with single-sensory impairments (visual impairments, hearing impairments).   As a result, practices or instructional methods that are developed and tested through the research activities funded under Part E may not be used in the schools because there are no tested models or procedures for implementing them.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> A new Part E authority must be established to support the adoption of exemplary research-based models and practices in the education of children and youth with high-incidence disabilities and single-sensory disabilities.  These model demonstration programs would facilitate the smooth translation of research knowledge into practice by encouraging the development and demonstration of innovative methods, approaches, techniques, etc. appropriate to the education of children with learning disabilities and single-sensory disabilities.  The Office of Special Education Programs needs to further disseminate information on special education research projects and how to access such projects.   This authority, however, must be accompanied by sufficient appropriations to ensure funding for these activities.  Research implementation should not come at the expense of new innovations and research.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>IX. TRANSITION</B><P>
<B>A.      Lower the Age When Transition Plans are Required to be Developed.  </B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Issue: </B>Currently, a transition plan must be developed by the IEP team by the time a student is 16, or when determined appropriate for the individual, beginning at age 14 or younger.  The majority of IEP teams, however, do not approach the subject of a student's transition from school into his or her adult life until the team is required to at age 16.  Unfortunately, many students with disabilities drop out of school before they reach 16 and do not have transition plans.   <BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation: </B>Lowering the age for mandated transition planning will increase our ability to keep students with disabilities in school.  Students will be better able to see and believe that they are learning skills that will lead to a job, to further education, and to living independently.  As Congress made clear in the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, we need to prepare students much earlier for their transition from school into the work place.  CEC urges the Congress to amend IDEA to require the IEP team to develop a transition plan for students with disabilities beginning at age 14 or younger.      <P>
<B>X.     PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION AND STANDARDS<BR>
</B><BR>
<B>A.     The Primary Grant Program Under Section 631 of Part D Should be Focused on <BR>
     State-of-the-Art, Innovative Professional Preparation.<P>
Issue:     </B>CEC believes that the long-standing grant program for professional preparation (Section 631(a)(1)) which is directed primarily to the institutions of higher education (IHE's) should be maintained, and that support to the IHE's should continue to be provided directly by the U.S. Department of Education on a competitive basis.  Many believe the limited federal preparation dollars are distributed across too many programs, thus restricting the prospects for success in any single program.  Further, there is a concern that the projects funded under this priority be tied more closely to the professional needs of the school districts and other agencies providing services for children with special needs in this period of innovative reform.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC recommends that this vital competitive grant program to the IHE's and other non-profit agencies have a baseline objective of supporting <U>innovative</U> and <U>state-of-the- art</U> personnel preparation projects, primarily for high incidence disabilities.  This baseline objective should include innovative approaches in meeting the need for new, highly-qualified special education professionals in all disability areas.  CEC further recommends that projects funded should have a strong link to the research base for instruction/intervention and professional preparation and should be coordinated with designated local education agencies (LEA's) and other agencies serving infants, toddlers, and preschoolers toward the promotion of research into practice in professional preparation.  Success measures for these projects should focus on the quality of the projects and graduates and should focus on the degree to which these projects promote change and innovation in the instructional settings of the schools and other developmental settings.<BR>
Projects supported under this authority would coordinate with the Professional Development Coordinating Council (PDCC, as described under Part C) in the states where the projects occur so that the PDCC entities are informed of the potential opportunities which could accrue to the particular states.  Projects would be funded for three years, with the potential of two years of further funding for demonstration and dissemination.  Dissemination should also be state-of-the-art, utilizing such vehicles as distance learning.<P>
CEC further recommends that Part D, Section 631, continue to include a separate funding priority for the preparation of leadership in special education and the related disciplines.  Leadership should continue to be comprehensively defined to include special education supervision and administration, special education research, and special education personnel preparation; and would be directed to serving both the high and low incidence populations.  Advanced graduate, doctoral, and post-doctoral training opportunities should be supported, as well as faculty institutes which would allow faculty to upgrade their knowledge and skills.<P>
CEC also wishes to stress emphatically the importance of an innovative baseline which would emphasize the development of cultural competencies and which would promote the ethnic and cultural diversity of the professional pool.<P>
<B>B.     A Foundation Program Should be Established for the Preparation of Personnel to<BR>
     Serve Children and Youth with Low Incidence Disabilities.<P>
Issue:</B>     Critical shortages are developing in the professional workforce of those providing special education to children and youth with low incidence disabilities.  Professional preparation programs are difficult for individual states to support, given the relatively low enrollments and relatively high costs.  Further, professional preparation programs on a state-by-state basis may not be justified given the demographics of low incidence.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC believes that the unique characteristics of low incidence makes this need area a special federal responsibility.  CEC recommends the establishment of a permanent foundation program for the preparation of professionals to work with the population of children with low incidence disabilities.  Preparation programs would be supported on a long-term, sustained, basis, for at least five year periods, and would be based upon supply needs and quality of program.  CEC further recommends that this foundation program be organized on a regional basis to allow for agreements across states, perhaps utilizing the geographic divisions already existing for the regional resource centers (RRC's) authorized under Part C of the IDEA.  The same foundation program should also be directed to another area of critical emergency need, namely, related services personnel.<P>
<B>C.     The Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD), as Required in<BR>
     Parts B and H, Should be Strengthened Through Reorganization.<P>
Issue:     </B>CEC believes that there should be a thorough restructuring of the current comprehensive system of personnel development (CSPD) now required of the states.  Currently, CSPD is far too much a paper exercise between states and the federal government.  Further, while commendable activity is now occurring in some of the states, with effective technical assistance provided with federal support, the system is ragged or nearly non-existent in other states.  Importantly, nothing in federal law or regulation <U>requires</U> the maintenance of any in-state entity for the planning, development, and implementation of the CSPD.  The emphasis has been placed on planning, rather than the actual delivery of training.<P>
CEC believes that a meaningful reform of CSPD at the state level could and should become the primary vehicle in meeting professional supply and demand needs in the particular states.  But such a reform would necessitate, as an essential, the regular commitment and involvement of all interested parties.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     In pursuit of a better-coordinated and more productive infrastructure, CEC recommends that the federal government require through the IDEA the establishment in each state of a Professional Development Coordinating Council (PDCC).<P>
<B><I><U>Authority:</B></I></U>  In order to provide maximum empowerment for the PDCC, its membership should be appointed by the chief state school officer, in consultation with the state director of special education and the head of the lead agency under Part H of IDEA.  If a separate authority exists for postsecondary education in the state (i.e. Chancellor for higher education) that individual should act jointly with the chief state school officer in the appointment of the membership.<P>
<B><I><U>Responsibilities:</B></I></U>  The PDCC would have the responsibility for planning, development, and implementation of all the components of the CSPD as determined in this reauthorization of the IDEA, as well as promotion of the quality of professionals practicing or preparing to practice, facilitation of interdisciplinary preparation, promotion of professional development in the context of school reform, and the coordination of any professional development systemwide change project in the state.<P>
The PDCC would also work with the PDCC's of other states on a regional basis as appropriate, for instance, on questions of reciprocity in certification and the pooling of professional development resources in such areas as low incidence.<P>
<B><I><U>General Education:</B></I></U>  Though its primary responsibility would be directed to the preparation of special education and related services personnel, the PDCC will assist in the preparation of general education professionals to work with children and youth with disabilities and assist in the collaborative preparation of all specialized and general education professionals by interfacing its activities with any appropriate state-level panel having responsibilities for professional development, and specifically any panel authorized for school reform purposes, including any required under "Goals 2000: Educate America Act."<P>
<B><I><U>Membership:</B></I></U>  All organizations and groups in the state involved in or having an immediate interest in pre and continuing professional preparation would be represented in the membership of the PDCC, including public and private institutions of higher education (IHE's), the state education agency, (SEA), the local and intermediate educational agencies (LEA's), the interagency coordinating council and lead agency under Part H, other appropriate state agencies, certifying bodies, parents and consumers, professional organizations, and any appropriate state and local reform entities.<P>
<B><I><U>Reporting and Accountability:</B></I></U>  The professional development plan would be given the status of a major, on-going portion of the overall state plan required under Section 613 of Part B of the IDEA and the annual application required under Section 678 of Part H of IDEA.  That plan would be developed and implemented by the PDCC, and reviewed and revised annually by the PDCC.  The state advisory committee under Part B and the interagency coordinating council under Part H would be required to submit comments at the time of original development and each annual review.  Annual review would place emphasis on progress made in meeting professional personnel needs in the state as well as lack of progress, with attention to barriers and remedies.<P>
<B><I><U>Lead Agencies and Resources:</B></I></U>  The state education agency and the lead agency under Part H would act as lead agencies to the PDCC in its planning, development, and implementation functions.  These agencies would be administering agencies for activities authorized toward implementation of the state-wide professional development plan.  Nothing, however, would preclude these agencies from taking any action toward the promotion of professional development they deemed necessary, whether approved or not by the PDCC.<P>
The current program of grants to the state education agencies under Section 632 of the IDEA would be retained and enlarged with new funds to provide greater support for the actual delivery of in-state professional development, especially at the LEA and other local agency level, under the reorganized approach.  The use of funds under this authority would be directly tied to implementation of the professional development plan as established by the PDCC.<P>
<B><I><U>Special Note:</B></I></U>  Finally, CEC recommends that the national clearinghouse on the professions in special education, authorized under Section 633(d) of IDEA, be refocused to provide information to entities involved in professional preparation and standards in each of the states.  Information provided should include professionally recognized standards, state-by-state certification and licensure standards, approaches to performance-based assessment, and alternative certification paths and strategies. <P>
<B>D.     Clarification Should be Made in the "Highest Standard" Provision Contained<BR>
     in Part B and Part H.<P>
Issue:</B>     Under the current Part B statute, Section 613, States are required to submit a State Plan that:<P>
"(14) set forth policies and procedures relating to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including--<BR>
     (a)  the establishment and maintenance of standards which are consistent with any State <BR>
     approved or recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable <BR>
     requirements which apply to the area in which such personnel are providing special<BR>
     education or related services, and<P>
     (b)  to the extent such standards are not based on the highest requirements in the<BR>
     state applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the steps the State is taking to<BR>
     require the retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional<BR>
     requirements in the State."<P>
Identical language exists in Part H, Section 676(13), in the requirements of the statewide system, except for the use of the term "early intervention services," rather than "special education or related services."<P>
CEC affirms the "highest standard" requirement contained in the law, but believes that clarifications are needed with respect to what constitute <U>appropriate</U> highest standards or requirements for professionals practicing in both early intervention and special education and related services.  CEC agrees that all professionals should have appropriate entry level academic and practical experience for delivering quality services to children with disabilities.   CEC disagrees, however, that current standards of clinical competence characterized by assumptions of a medical model of service delivery are necessarily the appropriate standard by which to judge the highest qualified standard for a service provider in an educational setting.  IDEA is a law which mandates a structure for the provision of early intervention and special education and related services.  Hence, IDEA is an educational law, not a medical or para-medical law; and standards recommended for its implementation should be specific to this purpose.<P>
Further, special education is experiencing dramatic changes in the manner in which services are delivered to children and their families, with increasing focus on natural, community, and inclusive educational settings rather than traditional clinical environments.  Appropriate emphasis is being placed on professional competencies for service delivery that are home- based/family-centered or classroom centered rather than clinic centered, and which include demonstrated cultural competencies.  Further, the failure of current certification standards to allow greater variability in the determination of specific occupational levels within disciplines has contributed seriously to current shortages in certain disciplines.  At the same time, the tremendous variance across states in the standards required for professionals in the same occupational categories often results in personnel certified in one state not meeting the certification standards in another state, resulting in unnecesssary emergency certifications and personnel shortages.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC believes that the bodies which adopt and enforce training and certification standards for educational and early intervention services, i.e. the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H, should be responsible for adopting the certificates by which highest qualified standards of professionals providing educational and early intervention services to children with disabilities under their jurisdiction are to be judged, and CEC recommends that the statute so state.  CEC further recommends that "specific profession or discipline" to which standards apply be further delineated to allow adoption of standards which apply to varied job or role levels within a specific profession or discipline.  The law should permit each SEA and lead agency under Part H to determine the specific occupational levels required to provide particular early intervention, special education, and related services and to revise or expand these levels as needed.  Further, the professions or disciplines, as well as specific sub-functions, defined by the SEA and Part H lead agency should not be limited to traditional occupational categories.<P>
At the same time that necessary flexibility is allowed to the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H to respond to emerging needs for children and families and corresponding trends in needed professional competencies, the professions and disciplines themselves have exercised and must continue to exercise a foundational role in the development of professional standards, including professional teaching standards; as well as in the academic, practicum, and supervisory requirements within a profession or discipline.  In that context, CEC recommends that the term "standards" as it appears in the language previously quoted in Parts B and H be changed to "professional standards."  Further, the word "area" in (a) should be changed to "profession or discipline" for consistency.<P>
<B>XI.     EARLY CHILDHOOD<P>
</B>The CEC Division for Early Childhood has focused on IDEA's impact on early  intervention and early childhood special education and has endorsed a package of recommendations.  CEC concurs with their recommendations which include:<P>
&iuml;     The continuation or initiation of service coordination for families of 3-5 year old children under Part B should occur if determined appropriate by the IEP/IFSP Team.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The current census-based funding formula for distribution of federal Part H funds should be maintained.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The noncategorical eligibility category of "developmental delay" should be extended from birth through the end of the school year in which the child turns eight years old.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The states should be required to set outcomes and report on progress in serving under- represented populations of children and families.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Various other adjustments in national policy should occur to guarantee a seamless delivery system for children birth through eight and their families.<BR>
<BR>
This package of CEC-endorsed, DEC recommendations is available from both CEC and DEC headquarters.<P>
<BR>
<B>XII. OTHER ISSUES<BR>
</B><BR>
<B>A.</B>     <B>Statutes Need to Clarify and Strengthen Responsibilities and<BR>
     Accountability Related to Interagency Agreements.<P>
Issue:</B>  There appears to be a great disparity among and between states regarding both the degree to which interagency agreements are in effect and the extent of efficacy of those agreements.  In some states, there appear to exist effective interagency agreements, while in other states, few or no such agreements exist.  In these latter situations, the schools, as holder of the "first dollar," are assuming the responsibility for, and the cost of, most or all related and transition services.  The question centers on whether the IDEA and/or other statutes can or should be further strengthened to reflect shared responsibility, accountability and cost for wrap-around, related, and transition services.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  Changes to the IDEA statute could strengthen the requirements for development and use of interagency agreements.  While CEC recognizes that all agencies, including education, health, mental health, juvenile justice, and social services, are struggling with financial concerns, more effective interagency agreements can serve as a vehicle for sharing the fiscal, personnel, and administrative responsibilities.  Further, we know that collaboration and cooperation between agencies are an effective method of service provision to children and youth with disabilities.  Model efforts, such as those funded by the Education Department's Program for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance and the Child and Adolescent Service System Program, or CASSP, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, bear witness to the effectiveness of programs that "wrap" a comprehensive array of services around the child.  If all children and youth with disabilities are to be provided a genuine opportunity to benefit from a seamless delivery of multi-agency services, statutory requirements for establishing, maintaining, and monitoring interagency agreements must be strengthened.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>We also wish to reference the current Part H provisions for interagency programs of early intervention services.  These policies and procedures provide a strong model for extending effective interagency agreements to all children and youth with disabilities.<B><P>
B.     Issues Related to School Discipline Should be Clarified, Consistent with FAPE.<P>
Issue:</B> Public and professional concern has been heightened by an increase in school violence.  As more students with disabilities are educated in general education classrooms with their nondisabled peers, teachers and school administrators are concerned that there appear to be two sets of rules regarding student's behavior and discipline.  In addition, schools are increasingly trying to take strong measures to address school violence, but believe they may not apply the same disciplinary measures to students with disabilities.<P>
Resolution of this issue will promote inclusionary practices since building administrators will be more willing to include students on their campus if they believe they retain the right to determine appropriate discipline without being in violation of FAPE.   Increased school safety will clearly benefit all students and school personnel.  It may be argued that violent behavior which is of concern today was not the type of behavior presenting itself at the time of the framing of P.L.94-142 and that different strategies are needed to address new problems.  Great care must be exercised, however, in the framing of these strategies to ensure that the original concerns of behavior related to the disability, and perhaps not under the student's control, are still appropriately addressed.  <P>
<B>Recommendations:</B> CEC strongly encourages careful examination of the issues related to school discipline and students with disabilities in a context much broader than the specific, last-resort factors of suspension and expulsion.  Efforts to foster preventive, proactive practices, appropriate behavior management, and school-community partnerships to address the special needs of children with disabilities are vital to effective, long-term solutions to the challenge of violence in the schools.   Cessation of educational services for any child is an unsound practice.  CEC recommends that Congress and the U.S. Department of Education clarify the intent of IDEA to include research, development, and dissemination of model programs and practices effective in the prevention and reduction of violent acts perpetrated by and against students with disabilities.  The Federal government must also accompany it's commitment to ensuring safety in the country's schools with adequate resources, necessary for the provision of appropriate services to children and youth with disabilities.<P>
CEC recommends that the principles of free appropriate public education (FAPE) and least restrictive environment (LRE) be the guiding forces behind any decision involving the disciplinary removal of a child with a disability from one setting and placement in another.  We clearly support the need to maintain the health and safety of students and staff in a school building; the Note under 34 CFR Section 300.513 clarifies that the so-called Stay-Put provision, as prescribed by IDEA Section 615(e)(3), does not preclude an agency from using its normal procedures for dealing with children who are endangering themselves or others.  This "danger to self or others," CEC believes, is a vital criteria upon which disciplinary action must be based, in line with the IDEA requirements of FAPE and LRE.<P>
CEC further recommends the establishment of a 45-day alternative educational setting which would be implemented upon the filing of a complaint consistent with Section 615 provisions, in cases where the child's behavior constituted a "danger to self or others."  However, placement in the 45-day alternative educational setting must, like any change of placement procedure used to move a child, under parental complaint or not, be the least restrictive placement possible for that child.   We reinforce that 45 days is a sufficient amount of time to complete an impartial due process hearing.  The IDEA requirement for a FAPE must be upheld regardless of the setting in which the child is placed; a complete cessation of services for any child with a disability is a violation of the basic tenets of IDEA.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>C.     School District Responsibilities Need to be Clarified for Students Being Served in      Private Settings (not publicly placed in private settings.)<P>
Issue:</B>  There is confusion regarding the extent of responsibility of the public schools to students who qualify for special education and related services and who are attending private schools.  In some states/LEAs, there appears to be an understanding that the student can receive benefit up to the dollar amount generated from federal dollars.  In other states/LEAs, there appears to be an understanding that the student shall receive the same benefits as he/she would if attending public schools.  In all cases, there is a lack of clarity about the definition of "genuine opportunity."<BR>
<B><BR>
Recommendation:</B>  As the system is currently operating, there appears to be considerable disparity, depending on geography, as to the special education and related services benefits a student enrolled in private school is entitled to receive.  Because this places parents in the potential role of "shopping" for appropriate services, clarification and more uniform application of the statute and regulation would benefit parents and students.  Clarification would also benefit all parties by reducing the potential for litigation.<P>
Numerous OSERS policy letters, as well as the Education Department's amicus brief in the recent <U>Tribble v. Montgomery Co. (AL) Board of Education</U> Circuit Court of Appeals case have made clear, in the ED interpretation, that statute and regulation do not make an individual entitlement to services for parentally-placed private school students with disabilities.  However, under regulation school districts do have an obligation to provide benefits to a class of individuals.  Clarification of these interpretations in both statute and regulation is necessary for practical application of this provision.<P>
<B>D.     There is a Need to Focus Increased Resources on Adjudicated Children and <BR>
     Youth who have Disabilities.<P>
Issue:  </B>Over the course of one year, 450,000 delinquent youth in the US are placed in juvenile detention centers and state training schools, while another 300,000 spend some time in adult jails.  Children and youth with a variety of disabilities constitute a considerable number of those served by the juvenile corrections system.  The relationship between youth identified as having learning disabilities, mental retardation, and behavior disorders and juvenile delinquency, though not causal, is strong, up to 60% of youthful offenders in certain correctional facilities have been enrolled previously in special education programs in public schools.  Unfortunately, the numbers of incarcerated youth are growing.  The incarcerated population in state juvenile facilities increased 14% over a five year period.  Further, recent longitudinal research data reflect poor outcomes for students with disabilities who have been incarcerated, including low rates of high school completion and limited employment success.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>  While the statistics appear bleak at first glance, it is important to recognize that many innovative, effective models for serving adjudicated youth with disabilities show great promise.  Practices that support meaningful special education programs in juvenile correction facilities include functional assessments, curricula and instruction; transition services; and collaborative linkages among community agencies.  However, without a greater investment in these innovative models and practices, incarcerated youth with disabilities may continue to struggle.  Additional resources must be dedicated to both research and instruction of this troubling population.  This could be achieved through competitive preferences in the currently authorized programs, or through directed priorities.<BR>

<CENTER><B>CLARIFICATION SHOULD BE MADE IN  THE "HIGHEST STANDARD" PROVISION CONTAINED IN PART B AND PART H<BR>
</CENTER><P>
<BR>
Issue:</B>     Under the current Part B statute, Section 613, States are required to submit a State Plan that:<P>
"(14) set forth policies and procedures relating to the establishment and maintenance of standards to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out the purposes of this part are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including--<P>
     (a)  the establishment and maintenance of standards which are consistent with any State <BR>
     approved or recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable <BR>
     requirements which apply to the area in which such personnel are providing special<BR>
     education or related services, and<P>
     (b)  to the extent such standards are not based on the highest requirements in the<BR>
     state applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the steps the State is taking to<BR>
     require the retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional<BR>
     requirements in the State."<P>
Identical language exists in Part H, Section 676(13), in the requirements of the statewide system, except for the use of the term "early intervention services," rather than "special education or related services."<P>
CEC affirms the "highest standard" requirement contained in the law, but believes that clarifications are needed with respect to what constitute <U>appropriate</U> highest standards or requirements for professionals practicing in both early intervention and special education and related services.  CEC agrees that all professionals should have appropriate entry level academic and practical experience for delivering quality services to children with disabilities.   CEC disagrees, however, that current standards of clinical competence characterized by assumptions of a medical model of service delivery are necessarily the appropriate standard by which to judge the highest qualified standard for a service provider in an educational setting.  IDEA is a law which mandates a structure for the provision of early intervention and special education and related services.  Hence, IDEA is an educational law, not a medical or para-medical law; and standards recommended for its implementation should be specific to this purpose.<P>
Further, special education is experiencing dramatic changes in the manner in which services are delivered to children and their families, with increasing focus on natural, community, and inclusive educational settings rather than traditional clinical environments.  Appropriate emphasis is being placed on professional competencies for service delivery that are home- based/family-centered or classroom centered rather than clinic centered, and which include demonstrated cultural competencies.  Further, the failure of current certification standards to allow greater variability in the determination of specific occupational levels within disciplines has contributed seriously to current shortages in certain disciplines.  At the same time, the tremendous variance across states in the standards required for professionals in the same occupational categories often results in personnel certified in one state not meeting the certification standards in another state, resulting in unnecesssary emergency certifications and personnel shortages.<P>
<B>Recommendation:</B>     CEC believes that the bodies which adopt and enforce training and certification standards for educational and early intervention services, i.e. the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H, should be responsible for adopting the certificates by which highest qualified standards of professionals providing educational and early intervention services to children with disabilities under their jurisdiction are to be judged, and CEC recommends that the statute so state.  CEC further recommends that "specific profession or discipline" to which standards apply be further delineated to allow adoption of standards which apply to varied job or role levels within a specific profession or discipline.  The law should permit each SEA and lead agency under Part H to determine the specific occupational levels required to provide particular early intervention, special education, and related services and to revise or expand these levels as needed.  Further, the professions or disciplines, as well as specific sub-functions, defined by the SEA and Part H lead agency should not be limited to traditional occupational categories.<P>
At the same time that necessary flexibility is allowed to the state education agency and the lead agency under Part H to respond to emerging needs for children and families and corresponding trends in needed professional competencies, the professions and disciplines themselves have exercised and must continue to exercise a foundational role in the development of professional standards, including professional teaching standards; as well as in the academic, practicum, and supervisory requirements within a profession or discipline.  In that context, CEC recommends that the term "standards" as it appears in the language previously quoted in Parts B and H be changed to "professional standards."  Further, the word "area" in (a) should be changed to "profession or discipline" for consistency.
