<p> 1.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief
brought by a law professor to protect his rights and the rights of
others to teach, publish and otherwise disclose unclassified
cryptographic information to foreign students and other foreign
persons without first obtaining a license or approval from the
government. The plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of specific
provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR,"
"the regulations"), 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et seq.</I>, that
require a license or approval from the government before "exporting"
cryptography and seeks to enjoin the defendants from using, or
threatening to use, such provisions to restrict him and others from
disclosing cryptographic information.<BR> <BR> <CENTER>JURISDICTION,
VENUE AND PARTIES<BR> <BR> </CENTER>2.  This action arises under the
First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Declaratory relief is
sought under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2201-02. The jurisdiction of this
Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331.<BR> 3.  The
plaintiff resides in the Northern District of Ohio.  Since this is a
suit against officials and/or agencies of the federal government,
venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1391(e).<BR> 4.  The plaintiff,
Peter D. Junger, is a citizen of the United States and a professor of
law at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland,
Ohio.<BR> 5.  The individual defendants are members of the executive
branch of the government of the United States.  The individual
defendants are sued as officers or employees of the United States
acting under color of law in their official capacities.<BR> 6.  Warren
Christopher is the United States Secretary of State.<BR> 7.  William
J. Lowell is the Director of the Department of State's Bureau of
Politico-Military Affairs, Office of Defense Trade Controls
("ODTC").<BR> 8.  Lt. General Kenneth A. Minihan is the Director of
the National Security Agency ("NSA").<BR> 9.  The defendants and their
respective agencies (also referred to as "the government") are
responsible for the interpretation and administration of the ITAR
provisions at issue in this complaint.<BR><BR> <CENTER>BACKGROUND<BR>
<I><BR> </CENTER></I><BR> 10.  The plaintiff teaches a course entitled
"Computers and the Law" at the Case Western Reserve University Law
School ("CWRU Law School"). The plaintiff has offered this course in
the fall semester of each year since 1993 and is scheduled to offer it
again this fall.<BR> 11.  In May 1993, the plaintiff wrote a short
encryption program that he intended to use in his class the following
fall.<BR> 12.  On numerous occasions beginning on or about May 7,
1993, the plaintiff contacted the Department of Commerce, Department
of State, the ODTC and the NSA to determine whether his program was
subject to export regulations.  To the best of plaintiff's knowledge
and information, any answer that the plaintiff received, or may have
received, from the persons he contacted is not binding on their
respective agencies and thus cannot be relied on by the plaintiff or
anyone else.<BR> 13.  The plaintiff has prepared, and continues to
prepare, materials for his computer law course. These materials
include (i) a casebook, which the plaintiff is currently revising for
use in class this coming fall, (ii) handouts supplementing and
extending the information contained in the casebook and (iii)
duplicates of some of those materials and additional materials that
will be available on the plaintiff's World Wide Web ("WWW," "Web")
server at http://samsara. law.cwru.edu or other WWW servers linked to
the plaintiff's server. <BR> 14.  These materials referred to in the
above paragraph currently include, or will include, the source code,
algorithm and representations of machine code for the encryption
program initially created by the plaintiff in May 1993 along with the
source codes, application programs and algorithms for other
cryptographic systems, including the Diffie-Hellman key distribution
protocol, the Hellman-Merkle public-key "knapsack" system (U.S. Patent
Number 4,218,582) and the RSA and RC4 algorithms. The materials will
also contain information on how to obtain and how to use programs
implementing the DES, triple-DES, or RSA algorithms, such as the
encryption program "Pretty Good Privacy" ("PGP").  The cryptographic
information<a name="F1"><a
href="#FN1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a> included in the
plaintiff's materials, other than his program, was taken from public
sources, including materials published in books, journals and on
internet.<BR> 
15.  For fear of violating ITAR, the plaintiff has
refrained from disclosing his program and other cryptographic
information to foreign persons other than some Canadian students that
he allowed to enroll in his computer and law class in 1994 under the
belief that disclosure to Canadians was exempt from ITAR. For the same
reason, the plaintiff has not disclosed his program and other
cryptographic information at faculty discussions in the presence of
foreign colleagues and, other than the Canadian students in 1994, he
has not allowed foreign students to enroll in his computer and law
class.  The plaintiff has required, and continues to require, that
students taking the class certify that they are citizens of the United
States or admitted to permanent residence in the United States.  <BR>
16.  In class, the plaintiff has disclosed, and will continue to
disclose, cryptographic information, including source codes,
representations of machine code, and information on how to use and
where to obtain functioning encryption programs to his students.  For
class this coming fall, the plaintiff will require students to
participate in exercises that require them to obtain and have some
hands on experience with cryptographic software.<BR> 
 17.  In discussions on the internet, the plaintiff has been forced to
be very careful not to disclose cryptographic information to foreign
persons for fear of violating ITAR.  Thus, for example, on or about
August 22, 1994, after Paul Leyland of Oxford University Computing
Services in Oxford, England, posted a short encryption program written
in the "C" programming language and which performs the same encryption
function as the plaintiff's program, to the sci.crypt.research
newsgroup, the plaintiff could not respond, as he wished, by posting
his program to the newsgroup.  Moreover, when the plaintiff sent
Mr. Leyland an email message requesting permission to include
Mr. Leyland's program in his course materials, the plaintiff could not
disclose his program or Mr. Leyland's program to Mr. Leyland without
violating ITAR.<BR> 
18.  The plaintiff wants to publish his course
materials as a text book and has begun writing a law review article on
ITAR and cryptography that will include his program and other
cryptographic information. For fear of violating ITAR, the plaintiff
hesitates to publish his course materials and any law review article
that contains cryptographic information.  <BR> 
19. For fear of
violating ITAR, the plaintiff has refrained from making his course
materials available to others with whom he would like to share
information.  Thus, on or about May 29, 1996, Peter M.  Gerhart, who
was then the Dean of CWRU Law School, requested a copy of the
plaintiff's course materials for a colleague in the People's Republic
of China. The plaintiff was forced to deny this request since the
materials contained information that could not be sent to China
without a license or other permission from the ODTC.<BR> 
20.  None of
the cryptographic information that the plaintiff seeks to teach,
publish or otherwise disclose is classified information, and all of
it, other than the plaintiff's program, is available in books,
libraries and on the internet.<BR> 
21.  The plaintiff has been
informed and believes that the defendants have taken the position that
software that contains no cryptographic routines whatsoever, but which
could be modified to include cryptographic routines, (also referred to
as "crypto with a hole") is subject to regulation under ITAR.<BR> 
22.
The plaintiff is required to register for a fee with the ODTC and
obtain a license or approval before he can lawfully "export" his
program or other cryptographic information that is not specifically
exempted under ITAR. <BR> 
 23.  The definition of "export" in 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.17 includes
"sending or taking a defense article out of the United States in any
manner," 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.17(a)(1), "[d]isclosing (including oral
or visual disclosure) or transferring technical data to a foreign
person, whether in the United States or abroad, 22 C.F.R. &#167;
120.17(a)(4), and "performing a defense service on behalf of, or for
the benefit of, a foreign person," 22 C.F.R.  &#167; 120.17(a)(5).<a
name="F2"><a href="#FN2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a><BR>
 24.  Cryptographic software is
classified as a "munition" under Category XIII of the United States
Munitions List ("USML"), 22 C.F.R. &#167; 121.1, and, thus, a "defense
article" under 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.6.<BR> 
 25.  At least some, if not
all, of what is included under the definition of "cryptographic
software" is included under the definition of "technical data" in 22
C.F.R. &#167; 120.10, which is also listed on the USML under Category
XIII and, thus, is a defense article. The furnishing of cryptographic
software and cryptographic technical data to foreign persons may also
constitute a "defense service," as defined in 22 C.F.R. &#167;
120.9.<BR> 
 26.  Under 22 C.F.R. Part 122, a person who intends to
export a defense article or provide a defense service "on behalf of,
or for the benefit of, a foreign person" must register with the ODTC
for a fee of at least $250.00 even if that person is not in the
business of manufacturing or exporting defense articles or defense
services.<BR> 
 27.  Under 22 C.F.R. Parts 123-25, a person must obtain
a license or written approval from the ODTC before exporting a defense
article, defense service or technical data unless some specific
exemption applies.  <BR> 
 28.  Thus, absent some exemption, a person
must register with the ODTC and obtain a license or written approval
from the ODTC before exporting cryptographic software and/or technical
data.<BR> 
 29.  The public domain exemption in 22 C.F.R. &#167; 120.11
and the exemption for general scientific, mathematical or engineering
principles in 22 C.F.R.  &#167; 120.10(a)(5) do not exempt all of the
cryptographic information that the plaintiff seeks to disclose.<BR>
 30.  22 C.F.R. &#167; 127.1 makes it is unlawful <BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>to
export or attempt to export from the United States any defense article
or technical data or to furnish any defense service for which a
license or written approval is required ...  without first obtaining
the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense
Trade Controls.</BLOCKQUOTE> <BR> 
 31.  Under the provisions of ITAR
referred to in the paragraphs above, the defendants can require a
license or government approval prior to the dissemination of privately
developed, unclassified cryptographic software and/or technical data
to any foreign person within the United States and to anyone, without
limitation, outside the United States.<BR> <CENTER><BR> <BR> CLAIMS
FOR RELIEF<BR> <BR> <I>Count One: Prior restraint</I><BR> </CENTER><P>
 32.  The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to
31 as if fully rewritten.<BR> 33.  The plaintiff has been, and is,
compelled to exclude students who are "foreign persons" from his
computer law course because it would be a violation of the ITAR for
him to disclose cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical
data that is not specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students
without first applying for and obtaining a license or approval from
the ODTC.<BR> 
 34.  The plaintiff is prohibited from disclosing
cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical data that is not
specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students, lawyers,
professional colleagues and all other foreign persons without first
applying for and obtaining a license or approval from the ODTC.<BR>
 35.  The plaintiff is prohibited from publishing his course materials
and law review articles that contain cryptographic software and/or
cryptographic technical data that is not specifically exempted under
ITAR if the course materials and law review articles are available to
foreign persons within the United States or available outside the
United States without first applying for and obtaining a license or
approval from the ODTC.<BR> 
 36.  The plaintiff is prohibited from
publishing cryptographic software and/or cryptographic technical data
that is not specifically exempted under ITAR on the internet without
first applying for and obtaining a license or approval from the
ODTC.<BR> 
 37.  The plaintiff must register for a fee with the ODTC
before disclosing cryptographic software and/or technical data that is
not specifically exempted under ITAR to foreign students and foreign
colleagues or publishing cryptographic software and/or technical data
on the internet.<BR> 
 38.  ITAR's restrictions on the export of
"cryptographic software" and "technical data" without a license or the
government's approval have chilled the plaintiff's speech and have
caused him to restrict his research and censor his publications and
communications with foreign persons.<BR> 
 39.  There is no provision of
ITAR that allows for judicial review of ODTC decisions.<BR> 
40.  The
provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above constitute a
prepublication registration and licensing scheme, and thus a prior
restraint on free expression, in violation of the First Amendment to
the United States Constitution.
 <BR> <CENTER><BR> <I>Count Two:
Overbreadth and Vagueness</I><BR> <BR> <BR> </CENTER>
 41.  The
plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 40 as if
fully rewritten<BR> 
 42.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
paragraphs above, as written and as interpreted by the defendants,
control a substantial amount of speech.  The provisions in question
govern all disclosures of cryptographic software and all disclosures
of cryptographic technical data that are not specifically exempted,
including disclosures of unclassified information.<BR> 
 43.  The
provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above, as written and
as interpreted by the defendants, have been drafted and applied in
such a confusing way that the plaintiff cannot be sure what
cryptographic information is exempt from ITAR and what requires a
license or written approval from the ODTC. As a result, the
plaintiff's speech has been, and continues to be, chilled.<BR> 
 44.
The provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above, as written
and as interpreted by the defendants, have been drafted and applied in
such a confusing way that persons other than the plaintiff cannot be
sure what cryptographic information is exempt from ITAR and what
requires a license or written approval from the ODTC. The plaintiff is
informed and believes that, as a result, the speech of others has
been, and continues to be, chilled.<BR> 
 45.  To the best of
plaintiff's knowledge and information, there are no published criteria
or standards available to him or the public on which the defendants
base their decisions to grant or deny licenses for the export of
cryptographic information other than guidelines for the export of mass
market encryption software.<BR> 46.  The provisions of ITAR referred
to in the paragraphs above are overbroad and vague, facially and as
applied to the plaintiff's conduct, and are thus unconstitutional in
violation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States
Constitution.
 <BR> <CENTER><BR> <I>Count Three: Restrictions on
Academic Freedom and Political Speech</I><BR> <BR> <BR> </CENTER>
 47.
The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 46 as
if fully rewritten.<BR> 
 48.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
paragraphs above restrict the plaintiff's rights to teach, research
and publish unclassified cryptographic information in whatever manner
he chooses and to whom he chooses.<BR> 
 49.  The provisions of ITAR
referred to in the paragraphs above also restrict and the rights of
the plaintiff and others, particularly foreign students and foreign
professors within the United States, to receive and discuss
unclassified cryptographic information.  <BR> 
 50.  A knowledge of
cryptography is important for understanding and evaluating government
efforts to establish key escrow systems, such as the Clipper Chip,
that have significant consequences for individual rights.  Thus,
cryptographic information is a matter of public debate, and in the
context of a public debate, restrictions on cryptographic information
are restrictions on political speech. <BR> 
 51.  The provisions of ITAR
referred to in the paragraphs above are not narrowly drawn, and the
government does not have a compelling interest to regulate all
unclassified cryptographic information.<BR> 
 52.  The provisions of
ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above are unconstitutional
restrictions on academic and political speech in violation of the
First Amendment .
 <BR> <CENTER><I><BR> Count Four: Freedom of
Association<BR> </I><BR> </CENTER><I> </I><BR> 
 53.  The plaintiff
realleges and incorporates herein paragraphs 1 to 52 as if fully
rewritten.<BR> 
 54.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
paragraphs above require that the plaintiff apply for, and obtain, a
license or approval from the government before allowing foreign
students to enroll in his class, before allowing foreign professors to
attend faculty discussions where cryptographic software and other
cryptographic information is discussed and before posting
cryptographic software and/or other cryptographic information on the
internet where it may be available to foreign persons. <BR> 55.  The
provisions of ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above restrict the
rights of the plaintiff and U.S. citizens and permanent residents to
freely associate with foreign persons to discuss cryptographic
information and further restrict the rights of foreign persons within
the United States to discuss cryptographic information with
U.S. citizens and permanent residents. <BR> 56.  The plaintiff and
anyone else intending to disclose cryptographic information for which
a license is required, other than those exporting mass encryption
software, must identify each and every recipient of the information,
including every foreign persons within the United States who receives
the information, in order to obtain a license from the ODTC.<BR> 57.
By requiring the identification of all recipients of cryptographic
information, the defendants are compelling the disclosure of foreign
persons who pose no threat to national security and with whom the
plaintiff and others communicate.<BR> 58.  It is practicably
impossible for the plaintiff to name each recipient of cryptographic
information that receives the information from the plaintiff's web
site or FTP server.<BR> 59.  The provisions of ITAR referred to in the
above paragraphs violate the plaintiff's and other's freedom of
association rights under the First Amendment.
 <BR> <BR>
<CENTER><I>Count Five: Separation of Powers<BR> </I><B><BR>
</CENTER></B><BR> 
 60.  The plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein
paragraphs 1 to 59 as if fully rewritten.<BR> 
 61.  The provisions of
the ITAR referred to in the paragraphs above allow the defendants to
control the dissemination of cryptographic information within the
United States and on the internet. <BR> 
 62.  The authority of the
defendants to implement and enforce ITAR is based on &#167; 38 of the
Arms Export Control Act ("AECA"), 22 U.S.C. &#167; 2778. <BR> 
 63.  The
AECA does not authorize the registration or licensing of disclosures
of unclassified cryptographic information within the United States,
including disclosures of unclassified cryptographic information on the
internet.<BR> 
 64.  By requiring registration and a license prior to
the disclosure of unclassified cryptographic software or cryptographic
technical data within the United States, the defendants are engaged in
controlling the exchange of cryptographic information between persons
within the United States, including the dissemination of cryptographic
information on the internet.  The defendants have therefore adopted
a<I> de facto</I> policy of restricting the domestic dissemination of
unclassified cryptographic information which has the direct effect of
restricting the availability of cryptographic software within the
United States.<BR> 
 65.  Congress, and not the Executive, is
constitutionally responsible for formulating and determining domestic
policy on cryptography and for placing restrictions on the
availability of cryptographic software within the United States.<BR>
 66.  Congress has not delegated its responsibility referred to in the
paragraph above to the President or the defendants. <BR> 
 67.  By
designating unclassified cryptographic software and technical data as
defense articles, the defendants are regulating information and
expression as defense articles.<BR> 
 68.  Section 2778(h) of the AECA
precludes judicial review of the designation of items as defense
articles.  <BR> 
 69.  To the extent that the AECA authorizes the
defendants to regulate disclosures of unclassified cryptographic
software and cryptographic technical data within the United States,
&#167; 2778(h) of the AECA unconstitutionally deprives the Judiciary
of its responsibility to review potential restrictions on information
and expression.<BR> 
 70.  Thus, the defendants act in violation of the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers by regulating
unclassified cryptographic information in violation within the United
States.
 <BR> <CENTER> <BR>
 PRAYER FOR
RELIEF<BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
</CENTER></B>     WHEREFORE, the plaintiff demands
that judgment be entered against the defendants.  Specifically, the
plaintiff demands such declaratory, injunctive and other relief as
follows:<BR>
<BR>
(1)     A declaration that the provisions of the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et
seq.</I>, referred to in the paragraphs above that require registration and
a license or government approval before the "export" of unclassified
"cryptographic software" and "cryptographic technical data," as those terms
are defined in ITAR, are unconstitutional in violation of the First and
Fifth Amendments and the constitutional doctrine of separation of
powers.<BR>
(2)     A declaration that, to the extent that the Arms Export
Control Act, 22 U.S.C. &#167; 2778, authorizes the regulation of
unclassified cryptographic software and cryptographic technical data within
the United States, &#167; 2778(h) is unconstitutional in violation of the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.<BR>
(3)     Preliminary
and permanent injunctions enjoining the defendants from interpreting,
applying, and enforcing the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22
C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et seq.</I>, to require that the plaintiff and
his students register or obtain a license or approval from the defendants
before disclosing to any person or persons by speech, publication or any
other means or by any medium, any unclassified information about
cryptography, whether or not that information is included within the
definition of "software" or "technical data" as those terms are defined in
ITAR.<BR>
(4)      A permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from
interpreting, applying and enforcing the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations, 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120 <I>et seq.</I>, to require that any
person or persons register or obtain a license or approval from the
government before disclosing to any other person or persons by speech,
publication or any other means or by any medium, any unclassified
information about cryptography, whether or not that information is included
within the definition of "software" or "technical data" as those terms are
defined in ITAR; <BR>
(5)      An award of attorney fees pursuant to the
Equal Access to Justice Act, costs and such other relief as the Court deems
proper.<BR>
