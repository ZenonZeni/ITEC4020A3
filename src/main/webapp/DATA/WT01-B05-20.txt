<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>

Dr. Robert Wills is the technical director of the American Tour de Sol.  He
has overall responsibility for the technical rules that the cars must meet and
the inspection process that verifies their compliance.<p>

        But Rob is also heavily involved in the electrical usage measurements
being taken as the plugged-in vehicles charge every night.  I posted earlier
about the NESEA Energy Challenge tests, where they are collecting data to
compare how far a vehicle goes when a gallon of oil taken from the ground is
used to power a gasoline vehicle and when a gallon of oil is used to power an
electric vehicle.<p>

        Rob mentioned that they are also looking at the energy usage through
the night.  The assumption that electric vehicles will charge at night is a
good one, but if the vehicle is plugged in the moment it gets home, it will
draw it's heaviest load early in the evening and tapper off over the night.
And if that's you and me and the girl next door all coming home in our EVs,
then that presents a significant early evening load.  So, they should get some
very interesting data on kiloWatt-hours used for charging, measured every 15
minutes, for 50 cars at once, as part of the oilwell-to-wheels research.<p>

        Rob spoke at length about the Power Quality measurements.  Years ago
when the loads on electric transmission systems were mostly motors, light
bulbs, resistive heaters (that is mostly inductive and resistive loads), the
power drawn from the grid had the same shape (waveform) as the voltage from
the grid; both were sinusoidal.  And the current was pretty much in phase with
the voltage, that is it had a `good power factor'.  (When the power factor is
`good', a watt measured with a watt meter, which essentially multiplies
instantaneous voltage times instantaneous current, represents the amount of
energy that is actually being delivered by the grid to the load.  When the
power factor is bad, the current leads or lags the voltage, and the watt-meter
doesn't reflect the amount of energy being delivered.)  You still have the
same amount of current, the same amount of heating in the wires, and the same
losses from the current, but the electric company cannot collect money for it.
It is then called `reactive power' or `imaginary power'.  The common fixes
were applied at the power plant or by putting capacitors on the lines af the
substations.<p>

        Life in recent years has gotten more complicated.  In large office
buildings up to 30% of the loads can be the plug-loads of computers and things
like that which only take their energy at the peak of the voltage waveform.
So, instead of having a sinusoidal current waveform, you have something that
looks like a little bump and only happens for a part of the cycle.  Those
current bumps, because they are not pure sine waves, have lots of harmonics,
mostly at 3 and 5 times the voltage frequency, which is 180 and 300 Hertz (in
power systems that operate at 60 Hz).  Transformers have higher losses at
higher frequencies, so it is necessary to derate transformers designed for
pure sinusoidal loads when they are faced with these spikey loads.<p>

        What's this got to do with EVs?  Well, we were seeing chargers popping
20 amp circuit breakers when the normal, average current reading meters said
they were only drawing 15 amps.  But with a special true RMS current meter,
which gives the equivalent heating value of the current, we were seeing 25
amps.  And the waveforms involved were very, very spikey with a sharp current
peak at the most positive and most negative parts of each voltage cycle;
probably only 15 degrees of conduction in each 180 degree portion of the
cycle.<p>

        Electric utilities are concerned about this not only because it can
cause overheating, but it can also cause distortion in the voltage waveform
that can cause problems in other equipment on the same circuit, as far back as
the step-down transformer on the pole!.<p>

        Another related problem is caused by the 3-phase power distribution
systems used by utilities.  In a wye-wired system, if the loads on the 3 legs
of the distribution power was equal, the current in the neutral would be zero.
Because of this effect, systems were commonly designed with the neutral leg
undersized by about 20%, to save the expense of copper that "never would be
used";  a practice allowable by the electrical code.  Many old buildings are
wired that way.  But when people started using lots and lots of computers the
neutral started to get overloaded and hot!  The reason is that while the first
harmonic waveforms, the 60 Hz waveforms, add to zero in the neutral when the
loads are in balance, but the third harmonic waveforms sum additively creating
3 times the original current in the neutral leg.  So new power system
practices in buildings require the neutral conductor to be larger than the
phase conductor, and power transformers now come in harmonic or non-linear
ratings to accommodate the extra neutral conductor load.<p>

        While simple battery charges may cause the same problem as computers,
it doesn't have to be so.  The traditional fix is to use ferro-resonant
transformer.  An additional winding on the transformer is used to control the
spikes and produces a rather triangular current waveform.<p>

        Modern power supplies and battery charges now use high frequency
Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) techniques that can align their current waveforms
to the voltage waveforms and are called "power factor correcting power
supplies."<p>

        So, during the overnight charging of the cars in the race, there will
be a harmonic analyzer, made by Basic Measuring Instruments (BMI) from
California (Sunnyvale?), looking at the entire charging station.  They will
collect data on overall power, power factor, and harmonic spectrum of each
phase of the main feed at hourly intervals, and also watch how the voltage
on the feed changes as they bring on individual car chargers.  During the race
they will also measure every individual charger and capture its harmonic
spectrum.  There is a wide variety of chargers here, from Solectria's which
are pretty well power factor corrected, to a number of old ferro-resonant
chargers, to some that are straight rectifier chargers, to some that are SCR
controlled and phase-angle controlled that can have poor power factor but still
have reasonable waveform.  The biggest part of the problem is the spikey
waveform, because that is what causes transformer and neutral overheating.<p>

        There is a UL/IEEE standard, number 519, that says that you shall not
have more than 5% harmonic distortion which means 95% of the current going
into a load must be in-phase, fundamental current.<p>

        A couple of good sources of articles on these topics are the magazines
called "The Electrical Inspector's Journal" and also "Electrical Apparatus"
which has great articles by one Richard Nailen.<p>

        I asked Rob which cars had caught his attention (before the race had
actually started).  He said the 3 hybrids where very interesting, because he
wanted to see how they did in the NESEA Energy Challenge.  Hybrid design is
not simple, but we are already hearing 80-to-90 miles per gallon numbers from
other races.  Until the `silver bullet' battery appears on the market, hybrids
may well be the path to the future.
