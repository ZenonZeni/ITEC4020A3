<H1>Forest backscatter mechanisms in CARABAS VHF SAR imagery 
<BR>
</H1>
<P>
An analysis of CARABAS SAR images (28-60 MHz) from a forested
area on the island of &Ouml;land in southern Sweden has been performed.
The result show that the dynamic range of the backscattering coefficient
among the forest stands is higher than what has been found in
conventional SAR microwave frequencies in studies of similar forests.
<P>
During the fall of 1996 a test experiment &quot;BALTASAR&quot;
has been performed in southern Sweden with the new generation
of CARABAS. As part of this experiment forest areas were investigated.
<P>
The aim of this project is to carry out experiments verifying
the CARABAS sensitivity for forest parameters and to develop a
model for low frequency radar backscattering from forests.
