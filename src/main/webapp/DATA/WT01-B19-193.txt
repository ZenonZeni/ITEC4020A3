<p align="center"><b>Update: Teacher Under Fire For Hemp
Presentation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 2, 1996, Simpsonville, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Donna Cockrel, the fifth grade school teacher who brought Hollywood
actor and hemp businessman Woody Harrelson to her class to
discuss industrial hemp approximately one month ago, is under
fire from both parents and school officials who have voiced strong
opposition to her actions.&nbsp; Recently, the award-winning
teacher was informed by the Simpsonville Elementary School Board
that she is being investigated because of complaints that followed
Harrelson's visit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Audrey Yeager, the DARE officer for the Shelby County Sheriff's
Office, was one of Cockrel's most outspoken critics.&nbsp;
&quot;Everybody says hemp and marijuana are not the same thing,
but they are; they're both illegal and it was being promoted to
10 and 11-year-old kids,&quot; she told camera crews from the
television show &quot;American Journal.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I am
terribly against it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the criticism, Cockrel adamantly defended her actions and
maintained that Harrelson's presentation related directly to her
curriculum.&nbsp; &quot;I still believe what I did in the
classroom was positive,&quot; said Cockrel who participates in a
state program known as Environment in the Classroom.&nbsp; She
said that industrial hemp, as well as kenaf, soybeans and other
alternatives to growing tobacco are frequently discussed in her
class.&nbsp; &quot;I believe in myself.&nbsp; My students believe
in me.&nbsp; If I'm not allowed to teach the truth to students,
I'd rather quit teaching.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cockrel further added that she believed Harrelson -- who was
adorned in hemp clothing for the occasion -- was just
&quot;showing what a product could be, not promoting it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Shelby County School Superintendent Leon Mooneyhand acknowledged
that Cockrel is being investigated, but failed to indicate how
long the investigation may take.&nbsp; &quot;I am looking into
the matter as I would follow up on any matter that got this level
of concern by staff, parents, and community.&quot;&nbsp;
Mooneyhand was reluctant to speculate about what sanctions, if
any, may be taken against Cockrel, but said that her job was not
in jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the past, Cockrel has been recognized and awarded for
enthusiasm in the classroom.&nbsp; In a 1992 magazine article,
The <i>New York Times</i> called her &quot;a dynamo [with] ...
boundless energy who's geared toward change.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harrelson, who is an ardent proponent of industrial hemp and is
part owner of a California company that specializes in hemp-based
clothing, was in town to speak at an international conference on
industrial hemp in Lexington.&nbsp; He was arrested in Kentucky
two days after speaking to Cockrel's class for planting four
seeds of industrial hemp in an orchestrated protest to bring attention
to the differences between hemp and marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>High Court Strikes Down Pennsylvania Rulings<br>
Requiring 'Exigent Circumstances' To Justify Warrantless Searches
Of Automobiles</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; In a
decision that has drawn criticism from civil libertarians, the
United States Supreme Court has ruled in a <i>Per Curiam</i>
decision that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was incorrect in
requiring police to obtain a warrant before searching an automobile
unless &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; were present. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In two separate cases, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court suppressed
evidence uncovered in warrantless automotive searches because the
&quot;Commonwealth's jurisprudence of the automobile exception
has long required both the existence of probable cause and the
presence of exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless
search.&quot;&nbsp; The court maintained that the police had
sufficient time in both cases to secure a warrant.&nbsp;
Therefore, they held that, &quot;The warrantless search of [a] stationary
vehicle violated constitutional guarantees.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The United States Supreme Court concluded that Pennsylvania's
interpretation of the &quot;automobile exception of the Fourth
Amendment's warrant requirement&quot; was incorrect.&nbsp; The
court maintains that an automobile's &quot;ready mobility&quot;
is a sufficient circumstance to excuse failure to obtain a search
warrant once probable cause has been established.&nbsp; In
addition, &quot;the individual [has a] reduced expectation of
privacy in an automobile, owing to its pervasive
regulation.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, the court affirmed that,
&quot;If a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to
believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits
police to search a vehicle without more.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Essentially, the court has stripped Pennsylvanians of their
state constitutional guarantees that provide local citizens with
greater protections against warrantless searches of their
automobiles unless both probable cause and unforeseen
circumstances are present,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;In it's never-ending fight to
assist in the 'War on Drugs,' the Supreme Court has trampled over
civil liberties mandated by Pennsylvania's own state
constitution.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Ginsburg dissented on the
basis that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the two
cases.&nbsp; &quot;A fair reading of [both cases] demonstrates
that the [Pennsylvania Supreme Court's] judgement almost
certainly rested upon [an] ... independent consideration of its
own Constitution,&quot; Stevens wrote.&nbsp; Consequently,
&quot;there is no reason for this court to disturb the state
court's findings.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>The cases are cited as Pennsylvania v. Edwin Labron and
Pennsylvania v Randy Lee Kilgore.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Washington Activists Gear Up For November
Election</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Seattle WA:</b>&nbsp; Organizers of
the annual Seattle HempFest -- one of the largest marijuana law
reform rallies in the country -- have announced plans to embark
on a mission to transform the Washington state hemp movement into
a political force. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling themselves the Washington Citizens for Hemp Reform,
activists will soon begin polling candidates in all 49 Washington
state legislative districts to determine candidates' positions on
the issue of decriminalizing marijuana.&nbsp; The information
obtained will be distributed statewide immediately following the
September 17 primary election in the form of a printed pamphlet
entitled the <i>Washington State Hemp Voters Guide</i>. The guide
will appear on both the Internet and in hard copy form. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Seattle-based organization also announced that it will embark
on a comprehensive voter registration drive and will launch an
educational campaign to directly inform Washington state voters
of the harm marijuana prohibition causes both society and the
environment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The debate is over,&quot; said spokeswoman Vivian
McPeak.&nbsp; &quot;It is time for state lawmakers to lead the
way in this political movement which is gaining momentum
nationwide.&nbsp; Voters need to know their candidates' and
legislators' view on this matter so they can make an educated
decision when casting their ballot.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact the Washington Citizens
for Hemp Reform @ (206) 781-5734 or write to: 916 NE 65th, Suite
