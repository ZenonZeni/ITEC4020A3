        Census 1996</strong></font></a></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Population in the Falkland
        / Malvinas Islands stands at its highest ever: 2.564
        residents, and so does prosperity: 1.364 registered
        vehicles, 1,5 for each household, 779 televisions; 751
        video cassette recorders; 257 computers and 734 washing
        machines.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">But the recently published
        figures of the April '96 census also show imbalances
        between the population living in Port Stanley and the
        Camp, as well as significant social changes. While the
        number of residents in the capital has jumped 63% since
        1982, and is now 1,638, the Camp in just ten years lost
        208 inhabitants and stands in 445 people.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The collapse of wool
        farming, the strong fishing industry and civil service,
        plus lately the prospects of oil have attracted many camp
        residents to Port Stanley looking for better payed jobs
        and causing at the same time a housing shortage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Since the declaration of a
        200 miles exclusive fishing zone round the islands in
        1985, the economy of the Falkland / malvinas has not
        ceased to grow, and the shortage of manpower to keep up
        with government development contracts has become more
        evident.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The previous record-high
        population was in 1931, with 2,392 inhabitants, while the
        lowest statistics correspond to the late seventies and
        1980 with a century low record of just 1.813.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Another interesting fact
        is that the Falklands / Malvinas have lately received a
        steady inflow of inmigrants reversing the tendency
        previous to the war, when local girls would marry Britsh
        Royal Marines deployed in the islands and emigrate to
        Great Britain. This also caused a serious imbalance
        between the male and female population (2-1), which is
        now almost normal (1-1).</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The 1996 census does not
        include the British military garrison in Mount Pleasant
        estimated in 2.000 strong, but does include 253 natives
        from the island of St. Helena generally employed in the
        base.</font></p>

        height="194"></font><font size="3" face="Arial">To the
        concern of Falkland / Malvinas islanders and British
        officials, Argentine Foreign Secretary Di Tella delivered
        in the United Nations Assembly a hardline message on
        fishing in the South Atlantic which raised the stakes
        dramatically.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Argentina's new position
        on a long term fishing agreement ruined any hopes of an
        early solution by insisting that any understanding must
        cover the maritime zones, not only of the Falklands /
        Malvinas, but of South Georgia as well.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The issues are
        &quot;indivisible&quot;, and &quot;<em>if we do not reach
        an agreement over fishing in the Falkland / malvinas and
        the Georgias, then there is no agreement</em>&quot;,
        remarked Di Tella.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Britain controversially
        controls the South Georgia fishery also, but sees no
        connection between the two groups of islands and rejects
        the new Argentine stance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Since the Falklands /
        Malvinas economy depends almost totally on fishing,
        mainly squid, which migrates in the South Atlantic
        between waters of the two countries, the new Argentine
        policy entails risks for the islands annual income from
        licences.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Both countries recognise
        that they need a long-term agreement if the stock is not
        to be over-exploited, but an agreement now seems further
        away than ever.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Di Tella has also said he
        intends to raise the issue of fishing in South Georgia at
        the next meeting of CAMELAR (Convention on Antartic
        Maritime Resources) in Australia.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Both Argentina and Chile
        have protested Britain's decision to licence fishing in
        South Georgia waters.</font></p>

        for some yet unknown reason the Argentines, who had also
        anticipated the phenomenom from the Marambio base in the
        Antarctic, firstly reacted by not releasing the
        information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A normal Dobson reading is

        September of Councillor John Cheek, possibly the most
        prominent of local politicians.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The candidates include a
        young Islander, who has a Chilean father and is back in
        the islands after seven years in the British Army; a

        who emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1978 and now is a
        Government Housing Officer is possibly the most bold of
        all candidates. Cofre believes Councillors must seize
        every possible opportunity to impress upon Argentines
        their political views and the right to self
        determination, but also favours a relaxing of regulations
        concerning visits from Argentine born citizens.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;<em>This needs to be

        is married to a former Royal Marine who runs a photo shop
        in the islands. Mother of five, June is a fervent
        defender of the islands' life style, (where she's now
        back for a second time), and feels she could make a
        contribution to the community and the Council.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;<em>I don't want the

        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The candidate with the
        highest profile in Michael Summers, 44, a sixth
        generation islander, presently a private consultant with
        a long experience abroad and in government. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Summers besides backing
        the official Council policy concerning links with
        Argentina favours rural development, promotion of the
        private sector and above all long term planning to make
        sure the islands keep their economic and political
        initiative in the coming years, and are not surprised by
        events.</font></p>

        resume talks with Argentina over sovereignty in the
        Falklands /Malvinas with the purpose of achieving a long

        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Tom Dalyell who has been a
        member of Parliament since 1962 and will be running for
        office once again in Linlithgow, Scotland insisted that
        the sooner an agreement on sovereignty is reached, &quot;<em>the
        better for all sides</em>&quot;. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Dalyell remarks have a
        special impact since it is almost certain that in 1997
        Great Britain will be ruled by the Labour Party.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Nevertheless in the last
        Labour Party Conference held in Blackpool members of
        Labour including Tony Blair, who will probably be the
        next Prime Minister, personally promised a delegation of
        islanders headed by two Councillors, that the wishes of
        the Falklander / Malvinases will be respected based on
        the right to self determination. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Anyhow Dalyell who shared
        lunch with Argentine Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter in
        London, believes that for several reasons it is essential
        for the islanders to have a constructive attitude towards
        an approachment with Argentine officials.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It is most difficult that
        the 1982 circumstances will repeat themselves when Mrs.
        Thatcher and Mr. Reagan had such a close and common
        relation, nor will British public opinion respond with
        the same enthusiasm.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">On the other hand if oil
        is found off-shore the islands the only way to extract it
        is with Argentine assistance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Finally Argentina's
        commitment to respect the rights, traditions and way of
        life of the islanders, is probably the most which can be
        expected in any future sovereignty agreement</font></p>
