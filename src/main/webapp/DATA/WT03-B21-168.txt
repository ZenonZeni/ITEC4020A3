<CENTER><B>TVX Announces Acquisition of Kassandra Mines Assets</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, December 21, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that it has completed, through its subsidiary TVX Hellas A.E., the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, TVX Gold made an initial payment of 4.5 billion GRD (approximately US$19.5 million) and will make a further payment of approximately 6.7 billion GRD (approximately US$28 million) payable in five equal annual instalments plus interest.

<P>In connection with the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets, and in accordance with the joint decision of the Ministers of National Economy and Industry, Energy and Technology, respectively, TVX will receive grants from the Greek state, amounting to approximately US$69 million based on 35% of the currently estimated eligible capital expenditures. In accordance with Greek law, this decision on the grants must be ratified by the Greek Parliament.

<P>To ensure the timely construction of the new plant to enable recovery of the gold, the Greek Government will also submit to Parliament a draft law regulating the issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant for the Kassandra Mines.

<P>The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region on the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximately 110 kilometres east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometres and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, producing lead/silver and zinc concentrates. Indicated current reserves at Kassandra are approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 2.8 million ounces), 1 00 grams per tonne silver (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3.6% lead, and 4.8% zinc. There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite in excess of 200,000 tonnes grading 22.65 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 145,000 ounces). The gold content of the ore was not exploited due to its refractory nature.
