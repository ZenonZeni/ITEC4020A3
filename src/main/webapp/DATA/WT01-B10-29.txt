A <a href="ch16mb.html#HSG">hysterosalpingogram</a> is an X-ray of the uterus and fallopian

tubes which allows visualization of the inside of the uterus and

tubes.  The picture will reveal any abnormalities of the uterus

as well as tubal problems such as blockage and dilation (<a href="hydrob.jpg">hydrosalpinx</a>).

 If sterilization reversal is planned, the point at which the

tubes are blocked can be seen.  This helps to plan the reconstructive

procedure.

<P>

If the tubes are not <a href="galut.html">blocked by scar tissue</a> or <a href="multi.html">adhesions</a>, the dye will flow into the abdominal cavity.  This is a good sign

but it does not guarantee that the tubes will function normally.

 It does give a rough estimate of the quality of the tubal structure

and the status of the tubal lining. Some cases where the tubes

appear to be blocked where they join the uterus, may in fact be

normal.  Often blockage at this location may be due to spasm of

the opening from the uterus into the tube or from accumulated

debris and mucus blocking the opening.  This can be managed by

<a href="recanal.html">passing a very thin catheter into the fallopian tube</a> either at

the time of hysterosalpingogram or during a hysteroscopic procedure.



<P>

A hysterosalpingogram may also indicate endometrial polyps, submucus

fibroids, <A href=" http://www.ivf.com/cme/hyst/img0019.gif">intrauterine adhesions (synechia)</a>, <A href=" http://www.ivf.com/cme/hyst/img0082.gif">uterine and vaginal septa</A>

uterine cavity abnormalities, or the after-effect of genital tuberculosis.

 The hysterosalpingogram may or may not be able to detect pelvic

adhesions, mild hydrosalpinx, small polyps, endometriosis, tubal

phimosis (clubbing of the fimbria at the end of the tube), or

immotility of the tube. Other tests, such as <a hrerf="http://www.ivf.com/cme/hyst/hyscme01.html">hysteroscopy</a> <a href="http://genome.eerie.fr/bioscience/1996/v1/f/parsons/list.htm">saline sonohysterography</a> or <a href="laprscpy.html">laparoscopy</a> may be necessary to accurately evaluate

your uterus. 

<P>

Although the purpose of the hysterosalpingogram is not therapeutic,

sometimes forcing dye through the tube will dislodge any material

which blocks it.  A number of women have become pregnant following

a hysterosalpingogram without further treatment.

<P>

Generally there is no special preparation needed for this test.

 However, depending upon your diagnosis, you may need to take

antibiotics to guard against possible infection.  To ensure that

you are not pregnant, the study is done between Day 7 and 10 of

your cycle.  Prior to the procedure you may take an anti-inflammatory

medication (Aleve or Motrin).  A small catheter is placed into

the cervix and the dye is injected.   You may feel heavy cramping

during, and for several hours following this procedure.  Expect

a sticky vaginal discharge for a few days as the dye is expelled

from the uterus.  Use a pad or panty liner during this time to

allow fluid to escape.  Any dye that remains will be absorbed

without any ill effect.

<P>

<U>NOTE:</U>  Be sure we are aware of any allergies you may have

to Iodine, Betadine, or Novocaine prior to the procedure.

<P>

If cramping does not subside or if you develop severe abdominal

pain or fever following this test, please notify Atlanta Reproductive

Health Centre at 265-3662.
