<H3>2. Photovoltaics</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Photovoltaic (PV) power uses semiconductor technology to convert sunlight 
directly into electricity without the need for turbines, generators or any 
other moving parts. Photovoltaics' rapid evolution has been tied to 
advancements in solid state physics and, like the computer industry, its 
future development could revolutionize the way we live.<a href="#340" name="r340"> [ 340 ] </a>
<p>     Photovoltaics' inherently modular technology lends itself to a wide 
variety of applications, ranging from hand-held calculators to rooftop 
generating systems and central station power plants. Because of this 
flexibility, and because PV systems can be used in diffuse or direct light 
in all climates - including every state in the U.S. - PV technology 
appears to have the greatest potential of all renewable resources.<a href="#341" name="r341"> [ 341 ] </a>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>     PV production costs have fallen more than fiftyfold over the last 20 
years, and generate power today at an average cost of 25 to 50 cents per 
kilowatt-hour for grid-connected applications. Grid-connected PV systems 
cost about $5 to $7 per watt to manufacture. At these prices, 
cost-effective PV applications are mainly for off-the-grid uses in remote 
locations where power is needed for water pumping, refrigeration, 
lighting, and communications. However, PVs can be cost-effective in 
specialized grid situations. For example, PV arrays sited at generating 
substations to support a utility's transmission and distribution system, 
and PV arrays sited at residential and commercial centers, have the 
potential to manage demand for electricity by shaving utility peak 
loads.<BR>
<p>     The <B><I><A NAME="BostonEdisonCompany">Boston Edison Company</a></B></I> has found cost-effective 
applications for PVs, even at today's prices. The Union of Concerned 
Scientists, in an extensive study, concluded that as much as 31 percent of 
Boston Edison's electricity could be supplied by renewables, including 
PVs. Boston Edison's break-even cost of supplying electricity (without 
adding in externalities) is $5.20 per watt - within the current cost 
range of PVs. PV technology has matured to the point where it can be 
cost-effective when transmission expansion is necessary, and can play an 
important role in utility transmission and distribution planning.<a href="#342" name="r342"> [ 342 ] </a>
<p>     As of 1994, the U.S. had just 18 megawatts of grid-connected PV 
installed capacity, and 25 megawatts of additional PV in stand-alone 
applications.<a href="#343" name="r343"> [ 343 ] </a>These numbers are expected to climb. Chart 15  shows the 
five principal PV technologies currently under development, and their 
present and projected efficiencies. With prices dropping, PV generation is 
likely to become a major source of clean power by the turn of the 
century.<P>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Amoco/Enron Solar">Amoco/Enron Solar</a>.</B></I> The domestic PV industry 
received a boost in January 1995 when Amoco Corp., which owns 
<A NAME="Solarex">Solarex<a> - the largest U.S. manufacturer and marketer of PV 
systems - launched a joint venture with <A NAME="EnronCorporation">Enron Corporation <a>, the nation's 
largest natural gas company. Together, they propose to build a $25 million 
manufacturing facility to produce PV modules and a $150 million, 
100-megawatt PV generating plant in Nevada that they maintain will be able 
to sell power profitably for 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (escalating by 3 
percent annually over 30 years).<a href="#344" name="r344"> [ 344 ] </a>When production begins in 1996, the 
plant will manufacture in excess of 10 megawatts of large-area 
multijunction amorphous silicon modules annually.<P>
<B><I> <p>     The <A NAME="SacramentoMunicipalUtilityDistrict">Sacramento Municipal Utility District</A>.</B></I> The 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) is perhaps the utility most 
committed to solar energy in the country. SMUD has implemented a wide 
range of solar technologies, including 2 megawatts of PV arrays located at 
its retired Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, 600 kilowatts of PV arrays at 
its Hedge substation (where it has developed a highly cost-effective 
single-axis mounting strategy), PV electric vehicle recharging stations, 
and rooftop solar collectors for residential and commercial customers.<BR>
<p>    <p>      <BR>
SMUD's "PV Pioneers" program has installed 4-kilowatt PV panels, 
manufactured by Siemens Solar, on customers' roofs, at a cost of $7.07 per 
peak watt. These customers seem eager to pay a premium for the 
satisfaction of generating and consuming clean, renewable electricity.<a href="#345" name="r345"> [ 345 ] </a>
SMUD has installed more than 240 systems in Sacramento's residential 
neighborhoods, allowing the utility to gain valuable insights into 
decentralized generation, whereby customers also become generators, 
feeding small increments of power into the fingers of the distribution 
network where it is often needed most.<BR>
<p>    <p>      SMUD's PV programs produced 63,971 megawatt-hours of cumulative 
power between 1986 and 1994. This electricity output, had it been produced 
by California's average mix, would have pumped 21,942 metric tons of 
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.<a href="#346" name="r346"> [ 346 ] </a>Instead, it was emissions-free.<P>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="SiemensSolarIndustries">Siemens Solar Industries<a>.</B></I> The leading U.S. PV 
producer, Siemens Solar, based in Camarillo, California, shipped 
approximately 15 megawatts of PV modules in 1994, and 12.5 megawatts of PV 
modules in 1993, representing more than half of all U.S. PV shipments and 
21 percent of the global market. In February 1995, the company announced 
its intent to increase production capacity by nearly 50 percent. Its core 
technology is single crystalline solar cells, but Siemens Solar also is 
developing copper indium diselenide thin-film cells. <BR>
<p>    <p>      Siemens Solar has also installed several grid-support systems. 
One is a 500-kilowatt PV installation at <A NAME="PacificGasandElectric">Pacific Gas and Electric <a>
Company's Kerman, California substation, which places the power generation 
source closer to the point of demand, reducing transmission and 
distribution costs. A second system, for the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, includes four-kilowatt residential rooftop systems and a 
200-kilowatt single axis tracking PV system for transmission and 
distribution support. Siemens Solar is also providing Southern California 
Edison Co. with off-grid systems.<a href="#347" name="r347"> [ 347 ] </a>
