         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>The Company is developing a
         series of proprietary blood cell disorder products to treat
         various forms of anemia. Anemia is the destruction of white
         and/or red blood cells, which weakens the immune system,
         leaving patients susceptible to infection that could result
         in serious illness or death. Anemia frequently results as a
         side effect of existing anticancer therapies, including
         chemotherapy and radiation, and from renal failure. The
         Company believes that its products under development may
         have improved therapeutic benefits relative to existing
         drugs available commercially, and may be used in conjunction
         with existing drugs or, in certain cases, may replace
         existing drugs.</FONT></P>

         Chemotherapy and radiation, used in the treatment of cancer,
         deplete the patient's white blood cell supply, thereby
         weakening the patient's immune system. This side effect,
         which can be life-threatening itself, requires the extension
         of the period between chemotherapy and radiation treatments,
         which may reduce their effectiveness in combating the
         cancer. As a result, therapeutic agents that effectively and
         speedily treat the side effect of anemia may significantly
         enhance the effectiveness of anticancer treatments. Sales in
         the U.S. of such drugs, estimated to be approximately $617.0
         million in 1994, as reported by Medical Advertising News, is
         dominated by Amgen's product GCSF/Neupogen. Patients using
         this product typically require 14 to 21 days to recover in
         the hospital, and until they have recovered they are
         generally not able to have another treatment of chemotherapy
         or radiation. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>The Company's preclinical tests indicate
         that its proprietary chemoprotective and radioprotective
         agent may reduce the patient recovery period, and may also
         reduce the side effects associated with existing drugs. As a
         result, the Company believes that its product may have
         significant market potential and that its use may enhance or
         replace existing drugs. The Company has received an IND and
         has commenced Phase I/II clinical trials on this potential
         product<A NAME="2"></A>. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

         Anemia Agent.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4> Aplastic anemia is a
         disease that depletes white and red blood cells, platelets
         and neutrophils. The disease affects an estimated patient
         population of 2,000 people per year. No current therapeutic
         agent in the market effectively treats all symptoms of
         aplastic anemia. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>The Company believes that its proprietary
         aplastic anemia agent has the potential to be to be the
         first therapeutic agent to treat all symptoms of aplastic
         anemia. The Company believes that the potential market size
         opportunity for such a product is $20 million. The Company
         received an Orphan Drug Grant for its potential aplastic
         anemia product from the FDA in June 1995 and an Orphan Drug
         Designation for this product in November 1995. The Company
