<P ALIGN=LEFT>Although herbs have been used for centuries to cure various ailments, healing in the 20th century has focused more on pharmaceuticals than on traditional herbal cures.  However, during the past decade, medicinal herbs have experienced a renaissance in the United States.  Today, herbal compounds are found in the pharmacy sections of large drugstore chains and supermarkets, direct mail catalogs, and natural products stores.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Many people have been attracted to herbal medicines due to the low health risk of treatments and their new found accessibility.  Media has focused on this rebirth in combination with the rise in alternative and complementary medical treatments.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Sales of medicinal herbs were estimated to be about $1.56 billion in 1995 and are projected to grow about 18 percent per year.  These products are sold as extracts, tinctures, ointments, syrups, lozenges, bulk items, teas or as supplements, either as individual herbs or in combination formulas.</P>
