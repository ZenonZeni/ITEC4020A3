<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>How to Make Alternative Medicine Work for You</CENTER></H3>
<A NAME="Para"> </A>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Parasites-Unwelcome
<BR>
Visitors in Your Body</CENTER></H2>

Even if you never leave home for exotic travel, you still may be suffering
from the ill effects of parasitic infection. Here's how to get the
parasites out of your body...
<P>
Your body may have unwelcome residents that are harmful to your health. The
possible presence of parasites in the body, mostly in the intestines, is a
little appreciated but major health problem, according to nutrition
educator Ann Louise Gittleman. You may think you are vulnerable to
parasites and any of a long list of &quot;worms&quot; and other parasites only if you
travel in tropical areas, but this is a dangerous misconception, says
Gittleman. You can get them (and probably already have) from merely staying
at home.
<P><A NAME="runs"> </A>
The shocking fact is that  undiagnosed parasitic infections (from
microscopic protozoa and various species of tiny worms) may account for a
great deal of the otherwise unexplained diseases currently besetting
America. One estimate contends that 25% of New Yorkers currently have a
parasitic infection; by the year 2025, 50% of the estimated 8.3 billion
world population will have them. 
Most doctors are unaware of the connection between parasites and health and
don't recognize the risk factors or clinical symptoms. These include joint
and muscle aches, anemia, allergy, skin conditions, nervousness, diarrhea,
bloating, constipation, chronic fatigue, immune dysfunction, and others. In
fact, members of the same family can have the same species of parasites yet
completely different clinical symptoms, such as, no symptoms, emotional
upsets, food allergies, fatigue, or bowel discomfort.
<P>
That's why Gittleman states forthrightly, &quot;If these symptoms and feelings
sound familiar, then you may be an unsuspecting victim of the parasite
epidemic that is affecting millions of Americans.&quot;
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>1. CLEANSE THE INTESTINES</CENTER></H3>


Parasites tend to embed themselves in the intestinal wall, but you can
flush them out by using one or more of these natural substances, added to
the diet: psyllium husks, agar-agar, flax seeds, comfrey root, beet root,
bentonite clay (take this orally only in combination with another
substance, such as psyllium), citrus pectin, or papaya extract. There are
several effective intestinal cleansing products available in natural foods
stores (see below). You might also take extra amounts of vitamin C (minimum
2g daily) to help flush out your colon.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>2. DO THE ROYAL FLUSH</CENTER></H3>

Do a colonic irrigation or high enema using garlic juice, vinegar (2
tablespoons per quart of water), blackstrap molasses (1 tablespoon per
quart of water), or coffee. Use filtered or distilled water for the enema;
further sterilize by boiling it for 10 minutes.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%><A NAME="herbal"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>3. PREPARE YOUR SYSTEM</CENTER></H3>

It is prudent to give your gall bladder and liver a week to prepare for the
parasite program. To flush the gall bladder, take lime juice in warm water
or Swedish Bitters before each meal. Eliminate all refined and natural
sugars during the parasite program; even better, start cutting back on them
during this preparatory week. Take barberry bark capsules, dandelion, or a
similar herbal extract to help cleanse your liver.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%><A NAME="walnut"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>4. FOLLOW WITH THE HERBAL CLEANOUT</CENTER></H3>

Naturopath Hulda Regehr Clark, N.D., Ph.D., recommends using a blend of 3
herbs to flush the parasites out of your system: use black walnut hull
tincture, <A HREF="#WORMW">wormwood</A> capsules,  and fresh ground cloves (to kill the
parasites' eggs). The following protocol is a composite of the
recommendations of Dr. Clark and Dr. William Lee Cowden, M.D. Do the
program for 10-14 days, take 57 days off, then repeat for another 1014
day round.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>CAUTION</B></FONT> All protocols are for adult dosage only and are generalized; that is,
dosages and conditions will vary with the individual. Listen to your body;
build up dosages slowly and carefully; only go at a rate you can tolerate.
Before beginning any treatment, consult a qualified health care
professional. This is especially important in the case of treating
children, or if you are pregnant.</P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>BLACK WALNUT HULLS</CENTER></H3>

If you take liquid extract, make sure the extract is made from fresh whole
green hulls of black walnut. You may also use Black Walnut capsules. Take
with water 1520 minutes before a meal.
<P>
For black walnut hull capsules, this is what Dr. Cowden recommends:

<UL><LI>
 Day 1: 1 capsule 2X daily 
<LI>
 Day 2: 2 capsules 2X daily 
<LI>
 Day 3: 2 capsules 3X daily 
<LI>
 Day 4: 3 capsules 3X daily 
<LI>
 Day 5: 4 capsules 3X daily 
<LI>
 Day 6: 5 capsules 3X daily 
<LI>
 Day 7: 6 capsules 3X daily
</UL>Continue at 2 capsules 3X daily through day 14. During the second 10 day
round, take 6 capsules 3X each day. For black walnut hull extract, this is
what Dr. Clark recommends:
<UL>
<LI> 
 Day 1: 1 drop 4X daily, mixed in water. Space the drops 4 hours apart,
starting in the morning.
<LI> 
 Day 2: 2 drops 4X daily
<LI>
 Day 3: 3 drops 4X daily
</UL>
Work up to 20 drops taken 4 times daily and continue at this rate until the
treatment program is finished.

<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>6.<A NAME="WORMW"> </A>WORMWOOD</CENTER></H3>

Wormwood works best when the full day's dosage is taken at one time, 1520
minutes before a meal, says Dr. Cowden. Here is his recommendation:
<UL>
<LI>
         Day 1: 2 capsules
<LI>
         Day 2: 4 capsules
<LI> 
         Day 3: 6 capsules
<LI> 
         Day 4: 8 capsules
<LI> 
            Day 5: 10 capsules
<LI> 
         Day 6: 12 capsules
<LI>  
         Day 7: 14 capsules
<LI>
         Day 8: 14 capsules
<LI> 
         Day 9: 14 capsules
<LI>
         Day 10: 14 capsules
<LI> 
            On days 11-14, take 14 capsules.
</UL>
Stay off wormwood during the same 5-7 days you're off Black Walnut, Dr.
Cowden advises; then resume at 14 capsules of Wormwood daily for another
10-14 days.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<A NAME="CLOVES"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>7. CLOVES</CENTER></H3>

For cloves, crush 
<I>
fresh 
</I>
cloves in a coffee grinder and fill gelatin capsules (size "00") with the
substance. Fill the capsules at once and discard any left-over clove powder
as it loses its potency quickly when exposed to the air. You will need 171
clove capsules, says Dr. Cowden. According to Dr. Cowden, this is the
schedule to follow:
<UL>
<LI>
 Day 1: 1 capsule 3X daily 
<LI>
 Day 2: 2 capsules 3X daily 
<LI>
 Day 3: 3 capsules 3X daily 
<LI>
 Then 3 capsules 3X daily through day 10 or 14 
</UL>
<A NAME="SEED"> </A>Take capsules 1520 minutes before a meal. Stay off cloves the same days
you are off Wormwood and Black Walnut, then resume at 3 capsules 3X daily
for another 1014 days. You might also use Proseed Grapefruit Seed Extract
during the first 3 days of this program for an extra germicidal boost.
<P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%><A NAME="OXYG"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>8. TAKE OXYGEN</CENTER></H3>

According to Dr. Joseph LaVolpa, N.D., P.M.D., a preventive medicine
specialist practicing in Santa Rosa, California, it's advisable to take
oxygen supplements to help flush the toxins out of your system and to
oxygenate the blood during this process of killing parasites. Useful here
are Oxyflex capsules (see below) which consist of super-oxygenated
magnesium plus ascorbic acid and bioflavonoids. Take 2 capsules at a time,
in between meals, or 6 a day, Dr. LaVolpa recommends.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%><A NAME="pure"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>9. DRINK EXTRA WATER</CENTER></H3>

It's important to drink much more pure water (not from the tap) during this
process to help your body flush the now dead parasites from your system.
Adequate, says Dr. Cowden, means at least 64 ounces per day for a 150 pound
adult.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>10. SANITIZE YOUR ENVIRONMENT</CENTER></H3>

When you've almost finished the 10 day round, wash all pajamas, bed
clothes, and sheets before using them again.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>11. EAT ANTI-PARASITIC FOODS</CENTER></H3>

According to Gittleman, these include pineapple and papaya, either as fresh
juice or in supplement form in combination with pepsin and hydrochloric
acid.  You can also use pomegranate juice (four 8-ounce glasses daily),
papaya seeds, finely-ground pumpkin seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup daily), 2 cloves of
raw garlic daily.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<A NAME="Flax"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>12. MODIFY YOUR DIET</CENTER></H3>

For bodies ridden with parasites, nutritionist Gittleman recommends a diet
comprising 25% fat, 25% protein, and 50% complex carbohydrates. You also
need a regular intake of unprocessed flax seed, safflower, sesame, or
canola oils (2 tablespoons daily), and higher than RDA amounts of vitamin
A. Flax seed oil is the most preferable because it has much higher levels
of alpha linolenic acid (commonly deficient in many people) than the other
oils.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<A NAME="RECOL"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>13. RECOLONIZE YOUR INTESTINES</CENTER></H3>

You need to reintroduce beneficial bacteria into your intestinal system now
that you have flushed out the parasites, Gittleman advises. The bacterial
strains most helpful here are Lactobacillus acidophilus, bulgaris, and
bifidus, and Streptococcus faeceum, which are available as nutritional
supplements.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>14. CHILDREN</CENTER></H3>

If you have children, they must be treated at the same time as the adults
in the household, Dr. Cowden advises. Children who can swallow capsules can
take doses of the above-described herbs reduced according to their body
weight. A 50 pound child would take 1/3 of the adult dose; a 75 pound child
would take 1/3 the adult dose; and a 100 pound child would take 2/3 of the
adult dose, says Dr. Cowden.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>15. PETS</CENTER></H3>

If you have pets, you must treat them at the same time as you treat
yourself, otherwise the chance of your getting reinfected from them is
high.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>16. MAINTENANCE</CENTER></H3>

After you finish your second 10 day round, Dr. Cowden recommends that you
wait 7 days then take, before your largest meal of the day,  2 doses a week
of: 3 capsules Black Walnut, 14 capsules wormwood, 3 capsules cloves. Take
this dose once on Monday, then once on Thursday, and maintain for 23
months.
Expect to feel uncomfortable for at least 12 days during the first 1014
days of the procedure. You may experience achiness, malaise, bloating,
intestinal discomfort, gas, even diarrhea for 1 or more days. You may
experience slight but odd shifts in your psychological state and you may
experience a variety of temporary sensations, such as, heat in your ears,
activity behind your eyes, a momentary sense of dizziness or imbalance, or
a transient loss of appetite. If you tend to have low blood sugar, this may
temporarily worsen before it improves.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>
17. CAUTION</CENTER></H3>

Expect to feel uncomfortable for at least 12 days during the first 1014
days of the procedure. You may experience achiness, malaise, bloating,
intestinal discomfort, gas, even diarrhea for 1 or more days. You may
experience slight but odd shifts in your psychological state and you may
experience a variety of temporary sensations, such as, heat in your ears,
activity behind your eyes, a momentary sense of dizziness or imbalance, or
a transient loss of appetite. If you tend to have low blood sugar, this may
temporarily worsen before it improves.
<P>
According to Dr. Cowden, these are signs that parasites lodged in various
body systems (eyes, ears, for example) are being killed off. You may also
have 1 day, he says, in which you feel completely rotten. This means your
body is temporarily toxic, filled with dead parasites, as your system
struggles to flush it all clear. You will feel fine, possibly exceptional,
the next day. 
<P>
You must drink extra pure water and take extra vitamin C to flush the
toxins out of your blood, Dr. Cowden says. For adults, take 2000-4000mg of
vitamin C every 12 hours until bowel movements turn to water. This will
indicate the toxins are being flushed out of your body. Do this over a 24
hour period, then reduce your vitamin C intake to 4000mg daily.
