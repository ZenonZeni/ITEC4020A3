Executive summary<BR>
<BR>
The meeting was highly successful, completing the structural adjustments
which followed the merger of two former working groups, and agreeing on
a Five Year plan. This includes about 25 Projects in the areas of data management,
network operations, standards, formats, user tools/ services, in relation
to Earth observation and auxiliary data sets. <BR>
<BR>
The first two tasks in the 5 year plan are led by CSIRO: <BR>
i) CD-ROM for educational organisations and developing countries and <BR>
ii) Network Demonstration showing real time and archived satellite data
and products, to be conducted at the time of the CEOS Plenary in Canberra,
13-15 November 1996. <BR>
<BR>
Other Projects of topical interest include an Information Locator Service,
aimed at increasing the ability of developing countries to log their own
data, and access that of others; global mapping projections suitable for
computer visualisation; metadata standards; natural disaster fast reaction;
network architecture; and yellow pages guide to Data Centres. Further details
are in project summaries contained in the Plan, which will be presented
to the CEOS Plenary for formal endorsement in November.<BR>
<BR>
Former sub-groups of i) WG on Data and ii) interim WG on Networks were mapped
onto a new structure, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Catalogues&quot; becomes &quot;Access&quot;, concentrating on
standards and tools which increase the ability of users to access information
and services. The chair is Terry Fisher of CCRS, vice is Dr Luigi Fusco
of ESA.
<LI>&quot;Networks&quot; and WGN becomes &quot;Networks&quot;, concentrating
on infrastructure, security and performance measure. Chair is Dick desJardins
of NASA, vice is Professor Kohei Arai, Saga University/NASDA.
<LI>&quot;Formats&quot; and &quot;Auxiliary Data Sets&quot; become &quot;Data&quot;,
emphasising interuse of data by ensuring compatibility of data content,
format and data application tools (including ingest, processing, integration
tools). Chair is Gunther Schreier (DARA/DLR/CEC) and vice is Wyn Cudlip,
UK Defence Research Agency. 
</UL>
<BR>
A User Panel has also been established, with the interim leader Dr Gerard
Szejwach. This panel will reinforce the WG's strong client-oriented approach.<BR>
<BR>
The meetings were held in conjunction with a number of events, including
sub-group meetings; a special interest meeting on the ESCAP &quot;Earth
Space Information Network for Asia and the Pacific&quot; and its possible
connection with the APEC &quot;Information Infrastructure Initiative&quot;;
a Project Team meeting, chaired by CSIRO, on the Network Demonstration;
and a meeting on the US/Japan &quot;Global Observation Information Network&quot;,
GOIN. <BR>
<BR>
Meetings were hosted by the National Space Development Agency of Japan,
in their new Earth Observation Research Centre, Roppongi. The EORC is a
new NASDA initiative designed to increase the usefulness and take-up rate
of EO data from NASDA missions. Its budget is approximately $50 million.
The Centre will host research by Japanese and foreign scientists. <BR>

<BR>
Attendance<BR>
</B><BR>
About 35 representatives took part at WGISS, with an additional 20 or so
at sub-group and related meetings. Australian participants were:<BR>
<BR>
Jeff Kingwell, CSIRO Office of Space Science &amp; Applications/Earth Observation
Centre<BR>
<BR>
Murray Wilson, CSIRO EOC<BR>
<BR>
Dr Peter Turner, CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research<BR>
<BR>
Dr John Lilleyman, CSIRO Division of Information Technology<BR>
<BR>
Mr Karl Nissen, Australian Centre for Remote Sensing.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Lilleyman's trip was funded by NASDA, which is supporting the CSIRO-led
Plenary Network Demonstration. Mr Nissen's visit was primarily NASDA funded,
for attendance at the ESCAP meeting. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Background<BR>
</B><BR>
The primary international Earth Observation body, the Committee on Earth
Observation Satellites (CEOS), is an informal organisation in which space
agencies work towards matching planned Earth-observing space missions to
the requirements of data users. Members include virtually all civil agencies
managing Earth observing (ie remote sensing, including meteorological) satellites
or carrying out major research programs in this area. International institutional
users of Earth observation data, or organisations with extensive ground-based
EO responsibilities, are eligible for Affiliate or Observer status, respectively.
Typical Affiliates are the World Meteorological Organization, the UN Food
and Agriculture Organization, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission,
and the Global Climate Observing System.<BR>
<BR>
CEOS began in 1984 among the G7 group of advanced economic nations. In addition
to founding organisations from North America (NASA, NOAA), Europe (ESA),
and Japan (STA/NASDA), CEOS now includes satellite-management agencies from
Russia, Ukraine, China, and space research organisations from India, Brazil
and Australia. CSIRO joined in 1989; its membership represents a commitment
to maximise Australia's environmental, social and economic benefits from
space technology.<BR>
<BR>
The CSIRO Office of Space Science &amp; Applications (COSSA) represents
CSIRO interests in CEOS and is the only Australian member. CSIRO co-ordinates
on CEOS matters with the Commonwealth Spatial Data Committee, the Australian
Centre for Remote Sensing, the Space Council, and other interested agencies.
COSSA's Head, Dr Brian Embleton, is the current chair of CEOS, and CSIRO
will host the 10th Plenary, comprising about 100 space agency heads and
research managers, in Canberra, 13-15 November 1996.<BR>
<B><BR>
CEOS Working Groups<BR>
</B><BR>
CEOS' Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) manages international
efforts to verify the accuracy and reliability of satellite data. <BR>
<BR>
CEOS's Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) carries
out technical tasks and standards definition, on data management; access
tools (such as WWW user interfaces); and in network infrastructure and performance.
WGISS was created in Moscow, November 1995, from a merger of the former
WG Data and the WG on International Network Services. It encourages a client-oriented
perspective on Earth observation data management and distribution. <BR>
<B><BR>
CSIRO interests in WGISS<BR>
</B><BR>
CSIRO has been an active member of WGISS and its predecessor, WGD, since
1992. The first two of WGISS' twenty-odd projects are led by CSIRO. The
first, the <I>&quot;CEOS Plenary Network Demonstrator</I>&quot;, will demonstrate
high-bandwidth real-time data transmission of satellite data, from the ADEOS
satellite due to be launched by Japan's National Space Development Agency
on 17 August. Using a dedicated leased 300 kbps line, moving window quick
look data from ADEOS, as received at the Hatoyama ground station, will be
relayed to the CEOS 10th Plenary in the National Convention Centre, Canberra.
The viewer's impression will be as if the observer was travelling on the
spacecraft, looking down at Earth in the vicinity of Japan. This is believed
to be the first example of intercontinental real-time image transmission
from a remote sensing satellite. The demonstrator will also show both realtime
and off-line data searching and retrieval, from Earth observation data centres
in India, China, Australia, and possibly Thailand. Using the Experimental
Broadband Network and the facilities of CRCs in Research Data Networks and
Advanced Computational Systems, these data will be processed in real time
in a distributed high performance computing environment.<BR>
<BR>
The second Australian-led technical project under WGISS is an educational
CD-ROM, containing case studies and datasets illustrating the social benefits
of earth observation. This package is designed to be particularly useful
in developing countries, and in schools. It will contain information previously
only available at high cost, or to those with substantial network capacity.<BR>
<BR>
CSIRO's efforts in geoscience data networks have also included contributions
to feasibility studies by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP), towards an Earth-Space Information Network for
Asia and the Pacific, ESINAP. In September 1994, over 20 Ministers responsible
for space programs in the Asia-Pacific region assembled in Beijing, where
they endorsed a new ESCAP &quot;Space Technology Applications for Sustainable
Development Program&quot;. ESINAP is being promoted under this Program,
notably through sponsorship by the government of Japan, which is also supporting
contemporaneous and similar proposals bilaterally with the USA (the &quot;Global
earth Observation Information Network, GOIN), and regionally, through APEC's
&quot;Asia-Pacific Information Infrastructure Initiative&quot;, and internationally,
through the G7 Environment and Natural Resources Information Network pilot
project.<BR>
<BR>
To a high degree, these represent congruent proposals, under different forums.
CSIRO believes that its own work on Earth science data networks, which are
focused on the Asia Pacific region, can contribute significantly to the
objectives of CEOS, ESCAP, and APEC. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Introductions</B><BR>
<BR>
Tasuku Tanaka spoke on the Earth Observation Research Centre, which he has
led since it opened in April. The EORC and employs about 100 staff (currently
includes several officers seconded from CNES) plus about 50 contractors.
The EORC has appointed Program scientists for each of NASDA major missions
- ADEOS, TRMM, and JERS. <BR>
<BR>
Hiroshi Kikuchi noted that NASDA have also established a series of semi-private
organisations to facilitate international co-operation. They have employed
Ms Cheiw from China, Mr Chaudhury (ex ESCAP), based in Bangkok, and a number
of others, for training and liaison purposes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Plenary issues</B><BR>
<BR>
I delivered a message on behalf of the CEOS Chair: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>the WGISS plan shows clearly the function of the WG, and guides its
form accordingly. The user orientation of WGISS is timely , and has helped
place CEOS in the driver's seat for long term co-ordination of Earth environment
monitoring.
<LI>For information, the following issues have been identified as high profile
themes for the current year:
  <UL>
  <LI>planning and analysis task force on gaps &amp; overlaps in space missions
  <LI>integration of space &amp; in situ measurement
  <LI>continuing validity of differentiation of members, observers &amp;
affiliates
  <LI>developing country issues
  <LI>appropriate technology
  <LI>access &amp; training
  <LI>agency/national actions (ILS, CD, ESINAP)
  <LI>promotion of value of EO (Yellow Pages, InfoSys, CD, Newsletter)
  </UL>
<LI>On horizon, CEOS faces the following challenges:
  <UL>
  <LI>enhanced EO capability of photogrammetric quality stereo near real
time imagery
  <LI>related issue of relationship between public &amp; private sector
data providers
  </UL>
</UL>
Chair welcomes appointment of Sec's Dr Alan Belward as incoming WGCV chair.
New process of consultation off-line chosen in order to increase proportion
of Plenary time available for substantive issues and technical demonstrations.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Summary of IGOS meeting in Seattle</B><BR>
<BR>
Refer documents 8, 9. CSIRO Space Industry News, Edition 68, was also noted
as containing a summary of the Seattle meeting. The Integrated Global Observing
Strategy is an exciting development which in some ways was anticipated by
work conducted by WGISS on data interuse, and on the use of single data
systems for multiple user communities. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Five year plan</B><BR>
<BR>
The following sub-group appointments were approved:<BR>
<BR>
Networks. Chair: Mr Richard desJardins (desjardi@eos.nasa.gov), NASA. Vice
chair Professor Kohei Arai, Saga University/NASDA.<BR>
<BR>
Access. Chair: Mr Terry Fisher, CCRS. Vice Chair Dr Luigi Fusco, ESA/ESRIN.
<BR>
<BR>
Data. Chair: Mr Gunther Schreier, DARA/DLR. Vice chair Dr Wyn Cudlip, BNSC/DRA.
<BR>
<BR>
The new appointments are to be effective immediately, and the past sub group
chairs be requested to assist the new chairs in making a swift and effective
transition to the new structure. <BR>
<BR>
The role of the User Sub-group (or Panel) caused the greatest difficulty.
Among the issues were - should user input be mandatory and structured, for
every task, including existing ones? How can the interests of users who
are not in Affiliated organisations be recognised? And should user interests
be a matrix activity, rather than a parallel sub-group? <BR>
<BR>
The Version 0.5b, plus agreed change list, plus new language on user panel,
was accepted as Version 1 (the 1996 issue) of the WGISS 5  year  plan, with
thanks to the writing panel recorded. <BR>
<BR>
The former SG chairs were thanked for their achievements and the chair was
asked to write on behalf of WGISS to their respective agencies, noting that
evolution of WGISS has resulted in the former groups becoming superseded,
thanking the former chairs for the body of accomplishment, thanking the
agencies for their support, and where appropriate, seeking a continuing
involvement in SG actions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>New Tasks</B><BR>
<BR>
i) Natural Hazards<BR>
<BR>
Martha Maiden spoke about Miriam Baltuck's proposal for a new WGISS task
in Natural Hazards. This has some elements in common with the CSIRO CD-ROM
project, for example, the contact details guide, and with the Plenary Network
Demonstrator, with the scenario based approach to data retrieval, analysis
and distribution. (Reference 19). Discussion led to conclusion that the
initiative should involve a broader group; should carefully define the output
products, and incorporate in its initial phase a review of current related
action. This could take the form of a Workshop, initiated by CEOS. <BR>
<BR>
ii) Network work area themes<BR>
<BR>
desJardins outlined a program of network security; network performance;
and network architecture. <BR>
<BR>
What were formerly known as &quot;network tools&quot; are now called &quot;user
tools&quot; and will be run by the Access sub-group, with related tasks
such as the WWW. <BR>
<BR>
Security <BR>
<BR>
desJardins spoke to a NASA/NASDA white paper (Reference 5). Issues include
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>user authentication
<LI>unauthorised use
<LI>data set protection
<LI>data set exchange
</UL>
iii) CEOS Information Locater Service Demonstrator Project<BR>
<BR>
Thomas Ruuwe spoke to Reference 20. CILS will use the CEO ESWE software
(public domain). Semi automatic generation of IDN DIFs. Presentation at
Toulouse Plenary, then at WGISS4. <BR>
<BR>
IMS protocol to major catalogues, with CIP upgrade path. Will draw together
with G7 ENRM metadata task (chaired CEO/EEA). Planned that US Government
Information Locator System, CEOS IDN upgrades, CEO advertising &amp; announcement
service, ESA's MUIS, and NASA's EosDIS, will all have interfaces with CILS.
CSIRO has been invited by DLR to act as the Asia-Pacific node for CILS,
with a CILS server at the CSIRO EOC, for the demonstration phase of the
project (~1997). This would place the EOC at a strategic junction point
between low and high-level information networks and their upgrades and interfaces.
<BR>
<BR>
iv) Strategy <BR>
<BR>
Kikuchi proposed a Strategy task, with a time scale of 10/15 years, with
the responsibility to consider long term issues and preparing for 5 year
plan revision and transition between near and long term action plans. This
idea met general acceptance: the WGISS chairs, sub-group chairs, and others
will comprise the team. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Task reports</B><BR>
<BR>
Yellow Pages<BR>
<BR>
This is a directory of on-line services, led by Shinichi Sobue of NASDA.
Deadline for inputs is July 1996. Presentation will be at WGISS 3<BR>
<BR>
Plenary Network Demonstrator<BR>
<BR>
Kingwell gave an introduction to the Demonstrator (WGISS Task 1), covering
purpose (Asia-Pacific mission displays; promote achievements of WGISS, develop
network and distributed processing methods). Reference 11. A special Project
Team meeting was chaired by Lilleyman on 30 May.<BR>
<BR>
CSIRO CD-ROM<BR>
<BR>
Kingwell discussed Reference 10 covering WGISS Task 2 - genesis, purpose,
content, future plans relative to the CD for developing countries and educational
institutions. Feedback included NASA declaring continued interest; repeated
offer of CD version of CEOS InfoSys, time permitting; suggestion to include
all or part of Yellow Pages guide; and action to provide contact information
to CSIRO. <BR>
<BR>
Ocean colour<BR>
<BR>
John Withrow spoke on Reference 24. Work is leading to a Workshop on data
merging and integration, and publication of data distribution policies,
and distribution of algorithms for processing ocean colour data. Part of
objective is to devise means of integrating ocean colour data from different
sources. Users have specific requirements:<BR>
. one format<BR>
. access to algorithms<BR>
. guide to data policies<BR>
<BR>
European Wide Service Exchange<BR>
<BR>
Ken Ingliss covered this. One advantage was that it allowed users, who have
their own data, to into relevant information on the system. In effect ,
EWSE is a self-building information system which contains advertisements,
data centre descriptions, and provides resources, including data browse,
access and ordering services. <BR>
<BR>
G-7 ENRM<BR>
<BR>
Ken Ingliss also spoke on the G7 Environment &amp; Natural Resource Management
data project (Reference 26). It seems as if CEO is creating a niche in large
scale data management projects funded by European Community, and is effectively
drawing together the growing number of &quot;information superhighway&quot;
proposals championed by disparate communities. For example, the CEO is the
common link between, and is ensuring compatibility and best fit of, G-7,
CEOS International Directory Network, DARA's Information Locator Service,
and related work. Australia is participating in the G-7 through Kate Ord
of ERIN, but we have yet to forge a similar link between AEON, CEOS Plenary
Network demonstrator, ANZLIC/CSDC, NRIC's directory database, etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sub group Reports</B><BR>
<BR>
Format report<BR>
<BR>
Wyn Cudlip noted an ESA report on format approaches - Common format, HDF,
CEOS superstructure, etc. This seemed like a comprehensive and useful reference.<BR>
<BR>
FS has a Data interuse reference (conceptual) model.<BR>
<BR>
Agency reports<BR>
<BR>
ISRO<BR>
<BR>
National Resources information system links ISRO with user departments.
Covered IRS-1c, IRS-P3 (with MOS), launched early 1996. IRS-P4 to be launched
1997, with 9 band ocean colour instrument. IRS-P6, in 1999, to have 2.5
m pixel. Being studied - CARTO-2, with &lt; 1m pixel, ~ 2002. Applications/missions
studied include DTM (&lt; 5 m), multi-crop analysis. Current applications
shown in crop monitoring with IRS-1C; cadastral review; snow/cloud differentiation.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Next meeting</B><BR>
<BR>
September 16-20 Sub group meetings, inc, Sioux Falls, EROS DC Globe, Mapping<BR>
<BR>
October 8-10 WGISS 3 Neustralitz, 100 km north of Berlin, hosted by DARA/DLR.<BR>
<BR>
The WGISS-3 meeting will focus on:<BR>
. Task reviews (with exception of CSIRO's 1, 2, covered this meeting)<BR>
. User group initial actions and approach. <BR>
<BR>
April/May 1997 WGISS-4, Ottawa CCRS Canada. <BR>
<BR>
Options: 6-8, 7-9, 13-15 May, or 15-17 April. CCRS asking for preferences.
<BR>
<BR>
29 May 1996: <BR>
<BR>
Joint WGISS/sub-group meeting<BR>
<BR>
Presentation on Earth Space Information Network for Asia and Pacific<BR>
<BR>
Dr He Changchui made a presentation on behalf of the 60 members of ESCAP,
comprising 57% of world's population and about 31 m km2 . He explained the
relevance of the Network in addressing regional problems - natural disasters,
national development, poverty alleviation. <BR>
<BR>
Issues included:<BR>
<BR>
- rationalisation of ground segment<BR>
- access to information (equity, speedy distribution)<BR>
- data management including archiving<BR>
<BR>
He gave example which showed how ESINAP concept is already working at level
of human network and manual data transfer - fires in China, and assistance
from Thai, Indian ground stations. <BR>
<BR>
He stated that after the feasibility study, one of Australia, Thailand or
Japan were suggested as the master node. <BR>
<BR>
For implementation of network, ESCAP estimate a budget of about <BR>
$US125 000 for a &quot;minimum test mode&quot;, consisting of one primary
node and a client. &quot;Full test node&quot;, with 8 national nodes in
the region, would cost about $US500 000. Recurrent costs would be about
$US400 000. This will be based on voluntary support, with &quot;basic&quot;
funding from ESTO. He was pleased that the CEOS Plenary Network Demonstration
was, in effect, a test of the ESINAP prototype. (This was a dynamic presentation,
very complimentary to CSIRO and Australia). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Five year plan</B><BR>
<BR>
Helen Wood and Alan Haskell presented the approved plan (Version 1.0). Noted
the new tasks in Networks, Natural Hazards, the ILS; and the new themes
on strategic planning and promotion. <BR>
<BR>
Resources must be assigned for tasks to be accepted, and Task leaders must
sign-off on concluded or abandoned tasks, citing lessons learnt. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Other meetings</B><BR>
<BR>
I had several side meetings with NASDA personnel, and took part in the Plenary
Network Project Team meeting (separate report by J Lilleyman refers), and
the special meeting on ESCAP issues. <BR>
