<h3>Grazing Bill Update</h3>

<p>Thank you - all of you who called President Clinton urging him to veto S.1459 made your point! Unfortunately, a "compromise" on Senate Bill 1459 (this is also the House number) has been negotiated by Representative Sherry Boehlert (R-NY) under pressure from Speaker Gingrich and western grazing interests. Rep. Boehlert's office has conceded "this is a bill you (environmentalists) will not like". Interested parties had hoped to sneak it onto the House floor the next day. </p>

<p>When we found out (through the GrassRoots Environmental Effectiveness Network) what was about to happen, we and thousands of others from different environmental groups began making phone calls. When I spoke to one of Rep. Boehlert's aides, he indicated that their office had been inundated with calls! 
Our efforts paid off! The earliest this bill will come to the floor is the first week in September. </p>

<h3>Call today!</h3>

<p>Please call your representative(s) and let them know of your opposition to Bill 1459 as it now stands. Your representative can be reached through the Capitol switchboard (202) 224-3121. Again, your message of NO on both S. 1459 and Rep. Boehlert's version of the grazing bill is important.</p>

<h3>Adopt-A-Horse Program </h3>

<p>The Grand Jury investigation in Del Rio, Texas will not convene as we had hoped. The Grand Jury was to look into allegations which have been made against certain individuals within the Bureau of Land Management's Adopt-A-Horse Program. These allegations concerned BLM employees who have knowingly allowed wild horses to go to slaughter. The charges have been dropped! Redwings will continue to urge the Justice Department to investigate ongoing allegations of abuse within the wild horse program. Clearly this program needs constant monitoring.</p>
