Fund Compares With The Gift Of A U.S. Savings Bond">
<BR>

Many parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles have traditionally given
U.S. savings bonds to children. U.S. savings bonds can be given directly
or transferred according to the rules of the Uniform Gift to Minors Act
(UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA). The only way to give a
Kemper fund gift to a child is to establish an UGMA/UTMA account.
Here's how the gift of a U.S. savings bond compares to the gift of a
Kemper fund account.

Kemper offers a range of funds with varying objectives. At one end of the risk/return spectrum are funds whose primary objective is the growth of capital (<A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> and <A HREF="../funds/asian_growth.html">Kemper Asian Growth Fund</A>). At the other end of the risk/return spectrum are <A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper money market funds</A> whose objective is maximum current income consistent with the stability of principal. 
<BR><BR>
Mutual funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government and present greater risk to capital than U.S. savings bonds. Returns and net asset value will fluctuate. Money market funds seek to maintain a stable $1 share value, although there can be no assurance that they will. Investment by <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A>, <A HREF="../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A> and <A HREF="../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> in smaller companies presents greater risk than an investment in larger, more established companies. Also, investment in international securities presents special risk considerations including exchange rates, government regulations and differences in liquidity.

A savings bond is purchased at half its face value or denomination and
it is guaranteed to accrue interest  until it equals its face value.
<BR><BR>
Previously, a guaranteed minimum interest rate enabled investors to
project how long they'd need to hold the bond before it reached its
value. Starting May 1, 1995, the U.S. Treasury abandoned its practice of
offering a guaranteed minimum rate in favor of "market-based rates" that
will be set on May 1 and November 1 of every year. 
<BR><BR>
On savings bonds less than five years old, the U.S. Treasury pays 85 percent
of the average of six-month Treasury security yields or 4.56 percent
as of November 1, 1996. Rates paid on savings bonds that are five years or older are
85% of the average of five-year Treasury security yields or 5.53 percent
as of November 1, 1996.
<BR><BR>
If a savings bond earning market rates has not reached face value after
17 years, the government will make a one-time adjustment to make the
redemption value at least equal to the face amount.

Unless distributed, the earnings of a mutual fund are reflected in the

Previously, interest on the U.S. savings bond was credited monthly.
Starting with savings bonds sold on May 1, 1995, interest is credited
six months after its issue date and every six months thereafter. The
investor who redeems a savings bond between scheduled interest accrual
dates will not receive interest for the partial period.

The Series EE U.S. savings bond stops earning interest after 30 years.

The custodian you select when establishing the gift account will have
exclusive control of the investment until the child comes of age (age 18

If the savings bond you give is not established as an UGMA/UTMA, a financial institution will generally allow a minor to cash in
a savings bond if the child is old enough to understand the transaction
and can sign his or her name. If a custodial account is established, the
custodian you select will have exclusive control of the investment until
the child comes of age (age 18 or 21 depending upon your state of
residence).
