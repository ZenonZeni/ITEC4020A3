Because municipal solid waste (MSW) could be used to supply 4%

of the energy consumed annually in the United States, it is one

of the country's most important renewable energy resources. Currently,

however, about 62% of our municipal waste is being buried in landfills.

<P>

Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Texaco

are working together to develop a commercial process for gasifying

MSW to produce hydrogen.  The laboratory will focus on pretreating

MSW to prepare a slurry of suitable viscosity and heating value

to allow efficient and economical gasification and hydrogen production.

 Initial pretreatment approaches include hydrothermal processing

at saturated conditions around 300&#176;C with or without chemical/pH

modification, and mild dry pyrolysis with subsequent incorporation

of the product gas into an appropriate slurry.

In initial experiments, newspaper is used to represent the major

constituent of MSW--cellulose.  These experiments will be followed

by others in which progressively more representative MSW samples

are used.  Overall system modeling with special attention to energy

efficiency and wastewater handling of the pretreatment process

will provide guidance for scaling up the experimental process.

 Ultimately, scale-up of the pretreatment process will provide

sufficient material for demonstration in the Texaco pilot facility.

 Additional long-term objectives of this work include a more detailed

economic analysis of the process and development of a 
measurement/control

system to ensure slagging ash for variable MSW feedstocks.

<b><i>Recent Advances</i></b>:<p>


A hydrothermal pilot-plant experiment was carried out to shake

down the modified product let-down system with a feed mixture

consisting of paper and 10% polyethylene plastic.  This let-down

system consists of a lock hopper that allows the treated product

to be &quot;blown down&quot; to disperse the plastic component.

 The lock hopper let-down system performed as designed, but we

found that the hydrothermally treated product segregated in the

reactor allowed the water to exit but not the bulk of the solids.

 A consequence was that the level of dispersion of the plastic

component could not be determined in the final blow-down product.

 We are installing a modified mixer in the reactor to break the

bridging tendency of the solids.

One possible process for creating a high-energy slurry from MSW

suitable for gasification in a high-pressure gasifier is to first

pyrolyze the MSW at 500&#176;C.  Products from the pyrolysis would

include gases, water, organics, and char.  The liquid and solid

products should form a suitable slurry, and the gases produced

may be useful in providing energy for the pyrolysis process. 

To explore this possible process option, we are putting together

an ASPEN-based process model of the pyrolysis process similar

to models developed for slurries produced using hydrothermal means.

 The model will initially be used to investigate the use of rotary

kiln pyrolyzers, which have been used in Europe to process MSW

and require a minimum of upstream preparation of the MSW feed

stream.  Our preliminary modeling shows that the hydrothermal

process option for slurry production is more energy efficient

than the dry pyrolysis option.  For the same feed and a similar

accounting for energy streams, the hydrothermal process requires

about 15% of the heat represented by the product slurry in the

processing compared to the 25% estimated for the dry pyrolysis

option.  However, the dry pyrolysis option could deliver a higher

heating value slurry which, depending on the manner in which the

downstream gasification is operated, may influence the overall

economics of the integrated process.
