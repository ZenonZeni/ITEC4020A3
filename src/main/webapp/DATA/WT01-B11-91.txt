<H3><B>History</B></H3>

Sperm microinjection (Intra-cytoplasmic spermatozoa injection -ICSI) was developed mainly to treat severe male infertility.  It has been researched over the last ten years, but its effectiveness has been demonstrated only in late 1993 in Brussels, Belgium.  ICSI allows infertile couples with a severe male factor to have genetically related offspring.

<H3><B>Who is ICSI for?</B></H3>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif"> Severe male infertility

<ul> Severe oligospermia (<1,000,000 sperm/mL)<BR>

Severe asthenospermia (low motility)<BR></ul>

   

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Absence or less than 5% fertilization rate after conventional in vitro  fertilization (ordinarily associated with undetected male infertility in the semen analysis or with light to moderate infertility)<br>

<BR>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">In vitro fertilization after epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA: removal of sperm from the testicles using microscopic surgery).<BR>

<br>

<br>

<H3><B>What is ICSI?</B></H3>

This new technique facilitates laboratory fertilization via the microinjection of one sperm inside the egg. Sperm with a low motility can thus be helped to penetrate the shell around the egg (zona pellucida), and achieve sperm-egg fusion.  A single living sperm, even with poor motility, can fertilize the egg.  Only the microinjection aspect of this technique, done in the laboratory, differs from conventional IVF.  In ICSI, the woman must follow the same procedure as for IVF with ovarian stimulation and ovum pick-up, followed by laboratory fertilization and embryo transfer after 48 hours.

<H3><B>Results of fertilization with ICSI</B></H3>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Less than 15% ova damage<BR>

<br>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">71% of microinjection ova will produce embryos<BR>

<br>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">90% of attempts result in embryo transfer<BR>

<br>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Clinical pregnancy rates:

         <ul>20% per trial<BR>

         25% per embryo transfer<BR></ul>

<IMG SRC="bulred.gif">Fetal abnormality rate is the same as in the general population.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<H3><B>Impact</H3></B>

The wonder of ICSI lies in the fact that the pregnancy rate with this technique, for severe male infertility, is the same as with conventional IVF for tubal factor infertility.  ICSI allows many infertile couples, whose only choices had been insemination with donor sperm or adoption, to become parents of their own genetically related children, thereby reducing the indications for TDI (Therapeutic Donor Insemination) and adoption.
