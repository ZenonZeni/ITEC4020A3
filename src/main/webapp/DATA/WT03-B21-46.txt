<h3> Speaking of Horses . . . </h3>

<p>Protect your horse! Redwings has rescheduled the Kiro Kinetics Freezemarking clinic to Oct. 12. Come join us for a day of freezemarking, identification pictures, and guest speakers. Kiro Kinetics is the only unalterable identification recognized internationally.</p>

<p>The recent theft of local horses that have yet to be recovered brings home the need to take precautions to prevent horse theft and have your horse freezemarked! Other actions include:</p>

<li> Take identification pictures of your horse in both summer and winter coats. 
<li> Don't leave your halters out to be used by  thieves. 
<li> Keep your pasture or barn well lit. 
<li> Know your neighbors, they can be your best "watch dogs" when you are away. 
<li> Create a double fencing system, a perimeter fence that can be locked with pastures and corrals inside. 

<p>Don't think this can't happen to you! If your horse is stolen immediate action is needed! The more time that is wasted the less chance you have for recovery! Call your local law enforcement agencies. Call your brand inspector, call auction houses. Call the media! Newspapers and television can reach vast numbers of people very quickly. Call the slaughter houses. Post fliers with a description and clear pictures of your horse. You must act immediately!! Redwings keeps lists of slaughter houses, brand inspectors, and auction yards which we will send to you. For further information call Shelly at (408)624-0315.</p>
