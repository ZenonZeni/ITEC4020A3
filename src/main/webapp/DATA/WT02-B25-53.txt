<p><a name="overview"><b>Overview</b></a><b> of the Science and
Treatment Kit</b>:</p>

<p>This Science and Treatment Kit is designed to help you create
awareness among key audiences in your community that severe
mental illnesses are biologically based brain disorders that can
be successfully diagnosed and treated. </p>

<p>Promoting widespread recognition that brain disorders are
treatable is essential to securing parity and ending
discrimination. Quite simply, why would a state legislator or
insurance company require coverage for these conditions -- such
as schizophrenia or major depression -- if they didn&#146;t believe treatment
was effective? </p>

<p>As evidenced by current federal and state debates around
parity in health insurance for brain disorders, misperceptions
about the effectiveness and cost of treatment continue to emerge
as counter arguments.</p>

<p>At the same time, individuals with a previous history of brain
disorders continue to be dropped from their insurance policies,
barred from securing a new policy, or faced with other types of
serious discrimination (e.g., jobs, housing). The assumption?
Brain disorders cannot be cost effectively treated, and people
never really recover. The insurance industry and major employers also
complain that insurance costs will escalate dramatically with
parity. </p>

<p>The Science and Treatment Kit will help you make strong and
convincing arguments that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Severe mental illnesses are<i> brain disorders</i> that
        are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, which is
        one of the body&#146;s primary organs. Brain disorders
        are biologically based medical problems like other physical illnesses.<b> </b></li>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.</li>
    <li>The cost of treating brain disorders is comparable to
        treating many other physical illnesses.</li>
    <li>People with brain disorders can lead healthy, productive
        lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>These messages are key to the success of this campaign.</p>

<p>This Kit is designed to be easy to use. It features practical
outreach ideas and examples from AMI affiliates across the
country, along with a variety of materials you can localize and
use in your communities over the long term. Each part of the kit
available on our site has a Microsoft® Word or PowerPoint®
version you may download for added convenience.</p>

<p><a name="know"><b>Getting</b></a><b> to Know Your Audiences</b>:</p>

<p>The Science and Treatment Kit will help you target three key
audiences: media, legislators, and the civic/business community.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Media</b> is the primary channel for reaching
    legislators, civic/business leaders, and a broader consumer
    audience with accurate information about brain disorders. You
    can reach these audiences by targeting science/health,
    business, and editorial reporters and public service
    directors. By crafting the right story angles, you can secure
    coverage of brain disorder issues. Provided in this kit are a
    variety of suggested story ideas and activities to help you
    attract the media&#146;s attention.</p>
    <p><b>Legislators</b> at the national and state levels have
    been increasingly involved in the debate about health
    insurance coverage for brain disorders. Even if legislators
    in your area are not currently engaged in this debate, seize
    the opportunity to lay a positive foundation before parity
    and other anti-discrimination issues emerge. Be proactive.
    Provide legislators with the latest cost and treatment information
    available, which demonstrates that brain disorders can be
    treated more cost effectively than many other physical illnesses. Adopt
    legislators, and educate them one at a time. If you can convince legislators
    to take brain disorders seriously, you have begun to shape
    future mental health legislation.</p>
    <p>Most <b>business leaders </b>have probably encountered
    family members or employees with brain disorders. However,
    these employers probably have limited understanding about the
    science and treatment of brain disorders and the need for
    comprehensive health insurance coverage and protection
    against discrimination. Many of your members have valuable
    ties to the business community. Ask them to arrange meetings
    for you to present the science and treatment messages.
    Through outreach to worksites and civic groups, you can
    convince business leaders that brain disorders are serious
    problems which can be effectively treated. Health insurance executives
    are also an important business audience because they play a
    pivotal role in shaping the extent of coverage for brain disorders.
    In addition, local voluntary organizations can lend their support
    to anti-discrimination efforts if they are equipped with information
    about the impact of brain disorders on their members and
    communities.</p>
