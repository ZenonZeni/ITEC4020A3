<HR NOSHADE>

Standing on a thin ledge of rock, just below Hell's Gate falls on the
Fraser River, William Ricker dips his net into the eddy at his feet.
He brings up a six pound <A HREF="http://www.wild-eyed.org/sockeye.htm">sockeye salmon</A> for tagging. This one is fresh
and strong, not like the tired ones who are having trouble with the
rapids. Again and again the weak ones find their way into his net.
From a pocket, Ricker pulls out two little red and white metal disks
and a 5 cm pin. He wipes his brow and waves to his partner who is
also tagging fish a few meters away. The sun is hot. A steady hot wind
blows up the narrow canyon.<P>

"Of course there was no road down to 'The Gate' in those days," says
Ricker. "Only a steep trail actually, but nothing you
couldn't handle if you were young and skookum."<P>

Ricker was 30. It was the summer of 1938, the first time he had worked
on the big river and he was enjoying himself. 
It was also the first year of the Canadian Salmon Commission's study
of Fraser sockeye. <P>
While his partner held a fish down, Ricker used a pair of pliers 
to attach the bright tag through the fish's
body just below the dorsal fin. Then he threw the wild sockeye
back into the water to fight its way upriver. The
roar of the rapids, the cool water swirling around his feet
and the hot wind made a perfect combination for Ricker. 
The team of four men managed to catch and tag up to
20 fish per hour, several thousand in all. Enough to
accomplish the goals of the study: "We wanted to find what
fraction of the fish went to each of a dozen or so spawning regions
to mate and lay eggs at different seasons. Observers 
in those regions were on the 
lookout for the salmon and were making estimates of the numbers 
on each spawning ground," says Ricker.<P>

Knowing the number of spawners is crucial if you want to
predict how many fish will be available for future harvest. 
Ricker knows salmon runs like some people know World Series 
baseball statistics. 
He has kept track of the Commission's estimates of the Fraser
River sockeye ever since that day in 1938. Each year different 
numbers of salmon return to spawn depending on the
species. Also, they go through cycles. For example, the big 
salmon run of 1993 is the same "line" or "cycle" as the 
record run of 1913 which was around 100 million fish. For
sockeye, such huge numbers occur only every 4 years. So the
next big run should be 1997. Off years are one tenth as
numerous or less.<P>

Ricker was the first to suggest several possible reasons
for the cyclic variation in returning salmon stocks. Biologists
are still collecting evidence to determine the correct
explanation. The Fraser sockeye are on a 4-year cycle
possibly because most of the fish mature at 4 years of age.
Farther north age 5 is also common. Pink salmon have a 2-year
life cycle. For cohos it's usually 3 years, while chinook or
"spring" salmon return at any age from 2 to 7 years. The most
powerful and largest of all salmon, a chinook holds the world
record, weighing in at over 57kg.<P>


<B>History</B>:<BR>
When he was eleven years old William Ricker began studying his dad's
star charts. Eventually he could name all the constellations and the
brightest stars.  All through high school Springtime found Ricker up
most mornings at 5:00 am. For three hours before breakfast he would
ride his bike into the woods or along the shoreline near North Bay,
Ontario looking for birds. Then he...<P>

1. The Ricker Curve, developed in the 50s, is still used all over the world
to determine average maximum catches for regional fisheries. Each coloured curve
represents a different type of fish population.<P>

2. Line of natural replacement. Along this line, spawners are replaced by an
equal number of adult progeny<P>

3. Salmon are interesting because their Ricker curve looks more like this.
At this point you have reduced the population to 40%, but some fish,
like salmon, produce many more mature progeny when spawning grounds are
less crowded.<P>

4. Natural Equilibrium. At this point, spawners equal progeny. You can't
catch any fish, if you want to maintain the population at this level.
Fish don't naturally go much beyond this level because they get too crowded.
Spawning beds get messed up and many eggs die.<P>

5. When you catch fish, say 20%, you move back here on the green Ricker
curve. You have less progeny, but enough to sustain a catch of
20%--a surplus.<P>

6. The  point of maximum sustainable catch is
actually a bit to the left of the maximum point on the curve. This is
because the distance between the curve and the replacement
line is the greatest at this point. Anywhere to the left of this
line you are overfishing and will reduce the next generation's harvest.<P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
Biologists must be able to tell the difference between many different
species. You can try it too:<P>
<UL><LI><B>You'll Need</B>:
<UL>
<LI>A library book with good pictures and descriptions of fish local to your area.
Try cod or salmon.
<LI>A trip to a big fish market or your favourite fishing spot.
<P>
</UL>

<LI><B>What to do:</B><BR>
<UL>
At the market:<BR>
<LI>Take your book to the fish market and try to find the distinguishing feature
of each type of salmon, or cod that is available.
<LI>Write down their proper Latin names
<LI> See if you can find any fish that are mislabeled in the market.
If you go fishing:
<LI> Try to identify everything you catch. Note the depth, water temperature and
time of day.
<LI> Keeping records like this is not only scientific, it will help you catch more
fish!
