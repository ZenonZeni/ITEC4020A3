<H2>VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES</H2>
<P>
<hr>
A number of NAMI members use the Department of Veterans Affairs
[VA] and/or military facilities for psychiatric care for themselves
or a family member.  Since 1989 NAMI has advocated on behalf of
these populations because they are often not included in the overall
civilian planning and development of community-based treatment
and services for which they, as citizens, ought to be eligible.
<P>
What are some examples of how NAMI advocates on behalf  of veterans,
active-duty military, and/or their dependents with severe mental
illness?
<P>
--In 1990 NAMI's alert helped reverse the congressional decision
to cut $800,000,000 in psychiatric care for dependents of active-duty
military.
<P>
--In 1991 NAMI supported the Disabled American Veterans [DAV]
class-action lawsuit to restore $125,000,000 for 13,500 &quot;incompetent
veterans.&quot;
<P>
--Since 1994 NAMI has had representatives on the VA Undersecretary
for Health's Special Committee for the Seriously Mentally Ill
Veteran.
<P>
--Since 1994 NAMI has sent presenters to the VA National Training
Program continuing education workshops [&quot;Strengthening Systems
for the Primary Care of Veterans with Psychiatric Disorders&quot;].
<P>
--Each year NAMI provides expert testimony at congressional committee
hearings regarding veterans with serious mental illness.
<P>
What can NAMI do to help a veteran and his family?
<P>
NAMI can provide expertise in developing a family support group
at your local Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
<P>
NAMI can provide the latest data about serious mental illness
and serve as an information clearinghouse.
<P>
NAMI's Homeless and Missing service can assist families of the
200,000 homeless veterans with chronic mental illness.
<P>
I am a veteran. How can I or my family get help for my medical
problems?
<P>
Medical care (including psychiatric care) is just one of 
<P>
the many benefits and services to which a veteran may 
<P>
be entitled. However, the federal government does not grant veteran's
benefits automatically. You must apply for them. Eligibility must
be verified and justified.
<P>
How do I become eligible for medical care?
<P>
Consult your local telephone directory under United States Government,
Department of Veterans Affairs, for the number to reach a VA representative.
 Toll-free telephone service is available in all 50 states, Washington
D.C., and Puerto Rico.
<P>
You must supply information that you were honorably discharged
(Form DD-214).  You must complete a financial statement (a financial
means test) for the past year.  This statement will be audited
by the IRS.
<P>
Upon verification of your discharge status and financial status,
you should qualify for inpatient and outpatient medical care.
 Note, however, that not all benefits may be available to you
if you enlisted for the first time on or after September 8, 1980,
and have not completed at least two years of that enlistment.
 For officers, the two year requirement applies on or after October
17, 1981.
<P>
My psychiatric disorder began while I was on active duty.  Am
I eligible for financial compensation in addition to VA medical
care?
<P>
VA pays compensation if you are disabled by injury or disease
incurred in or aggravated by active service in the line of duty.
 Payments are based on the degree of disability.  VA pays additional
money for your dependents if your service-connected disabilities
are evaluated as 30 percent or more disabling. 
<P>
In addition, if you are 30 percent or more disabled and your spouse
is in need of regular aid, an increased dependency allowance is
payable for your spouse.  Remember--getting service-connected
compensation  (or a nonservice-connected pension) can be a difficult
and complicated process. 
<P>
Qualifying for VA medical care does not automatically qualify
you for financial compensation or pension.  When in doubt, apply!
 You may want to get a representative (see below) to assist you
in applying for these benefits.  A rating as low as 10 percent
may qualify for financial benefits.
<P>
All service-connected veterans rated 50 percent or higher and
low-income nonservice-connected veterans are eligible for free
inpatient and outpatient care at VA medical centers and clinics.
 If VA facilities and resources are available, VA may provide
medical care for higher-income nonservice-connected veterans.
 They will be billed $39/outpatient visit; $719 per inpatient
admission; plus $10/day nursing care.  Check with your VA medical
center to see if this care is available.
<P>
Where can I go to get someone to represent me in applying for
financial benefits?
<P>
NAMI in the past has worked closely with the Disabled American
Veterans [DAV] organization.  DAV is independent of the federal
government.  DAV will help you file your claim for benefits by
building your case from the ground up--reviewing all pertinent
laws, regulations, precedents, and medical histories. 
<P>
DAV prepares claim forms and briefs.  They help you assemble the
required paperwork.  If necessary, DAV will represent you before
government boards.  They also review government decisions, take
appropriate action, and advise you if appeals are warranted.
<P>
Remember--NAMI does not have staff trained to provide this comprehensive
representation.  While we are confident in recommending DAV, there
are a number of other veterans' service organizations [VSOs] which
will represent you without charge:  AMVETS, American Legion, Veterans
of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and others.  NAMI
can consult with your representative to provide expertise about
mental illness.
<P>
I have lost my military discharge papers.  How can I get duplicate
copies?
<P>
Contact the VA to see if your records are on file.  If not, the
VA or your VSO representative can provide the form to help you
obtain records from National Personnel Records Center/Military
Personnel Records/9700 Page Boulevard/St. Louis MO 63132-5100
<P>
How can I contact a veterans' service organization [VSO]?
<P>
Call your local VA representative, your state/county veterans'
office, or contact:
