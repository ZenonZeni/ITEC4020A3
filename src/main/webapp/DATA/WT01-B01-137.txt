<B>COMMUNIST PAST STILL HAUNTS: <BR>
NATIONAL MEDIA REJECT GENNADY ZYUGANOV</B><BR>
<I><BR>
</I>Prior to 1991, and especially throughout the 75 years of Communist rule in the Soviet Union, the Russian press was ruthlessly controlled by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. Soviet "journalists" were mainly government information officers, and those who attempted to provide independent coverage, such as the editors of the <I>samizdat</I> publication <I>The Chronicle of Current Events, </I>were imprisoned or exiled.<P>

Memories of Soviet-era repression--prior censorship, government-imposed content, government press directives, and orchestrated campaigns of character assassination through the media--are still fresh in the minds of many editors today, some of whom experienced such methods firsthand. So it is little wonder that the media have reacted negatively to the prospect of a Zyuganov victory. When they haven't ignored him entirely, they have been vehement in their criticism. Russian columnists, for instance, pounced on Zyuganov for his hypocrisy in claiming tolerance for dissent when orthodox Communist journalist Nadezhda Garifullina of <I>Sovetskaya Rossiya</I> was fired in February 1996 for having criticized Zyuganov as too soft.<P>

The Communists have further fueled journalists' fears with frequent statements about their intent to renationalize private property, including the media. At a March 12 meeting of Communist academic consultants, who gathered to define strategy if the Communists come to power, there were calls for muzzling the press. A transcript obtained by <I>Izvestia </I>and published on April 17 quotes an economist who urged that the "media be prevented from mocking our military people." Presidential candidate Zyuganov went further: "The media are sitting on everyone's necks and dictating everything to the public. They distort the truth about laws passed, and impudently lie about ... the Russian Federation Communist Party [CPRF]. We will place the media under state control."<P>

If Zyuganov wins, it is clear journalists will have to battle to preserve the fragile freedoms they have won.<BR>
