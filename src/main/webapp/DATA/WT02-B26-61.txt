<P>
Twelve Things To Do If Your Loved One Is Addicted To Drugs And/Or
Alcohol:
<P>
1.  Don't regard this as a family disgrace.  Recovery from an
addiction can come about just as with other illnesses.
<P>
2.  Don't nag, preach or lecture to the addict/alcoholic. 
Chances are he/she has already told him or herself everything you
can tell them.  He/she will take just so much and shut out the
rest.  You may only increase their need to lie or force one to
make promises that cannot possibly be kept.
<P>
3.  Guard against the "holier-than-thou" or martyr-like attitude.
It is possible to create this impression without saying a word.
An addict's sensitivity is such that he/she judges other people's
attitudes toward him/her more by small things than spoken words.
<P>
4.  Don't use the "if you loved me" appeal.  Since the
addict/alcoholic is compulsive and cannot be controlled by
willpower, this approach only increases guilt.  It is like
saying, "If you loved me, you would not have tuberculosis."
<P>
5.  Avoid any threats unless you think it through carefully and
definitely intend to carry them out.  There may be times, of
course, when a specific action is necessary to protect children. 
Idle threats only make the addict/alcoholic feel you don't mean
what you say.
<P>
6.  Don't hide the drugs/alcohol or dispose of them/it.  Usually
this only pushes the addict/alcoholic into a state of
desperation.  In the end he/she will simply find news ways of
getting more drugs/liquor.
<P>
7.  Don't let the addict/alcoholic persuade you to use drugs or
drink with him/her on the grounds that it will make him/her use
less.  It rarely does.  Besides, when you condone the
using/drinking, he/she puts off doing something to get help.
<P>
8.  Don't be jealous of the method of recovery the
addict/alcoholic chooses.  The tendency is to think that love of
home and family is enough incentive for seeking recovery.
<P>
Frequently the motivation of regaining self respect is more
compelling for the addict/alcoholic than resumption of family
responsibilities. You may feel left out when the addict/alcoholic
turns to other people for helping stay sober. You wouldn't be
jealous of the doctor of someone needing medical care, would you?
<P>
9.  Don't expect an immediate 100 percent recovery.  In any
illness, there is a period of convalescence.  There may be
relapses and times of tension and resentment.
<P>
10. Don't try to protect the recovering person from
using/drinking situations.  It's one of the quickest ways to push
one into relapse.
<P>
They must learn on their own to say "no" gracefully.  If you warn
people against serving him/her drinks, you will stir up old
feelings of resentment and inadequacy.
<P>
11. Don't do for the addict/alcoholic that which he/she can do
for him/herself.  You cannot take the medicine for him/her. 
Don't remove the problem before the addict/alcoholic can face it,
solve it or suffer the consequences.
<P>
12. Do offer love, support and understanding in the recovery.
<P>

<P>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
<P>
What Is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?
<P>
ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed behavior disorder in
children.
<P>
The core symptoms are inattention, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity. Children with ADHD are restless and fidgety,
interrupt conversations, call out in class, and have difficulty
completing school assignments. They often do not have appropriate
social skills for their age group.
<P>
Although ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, it can persist
into adolescence and adulthood. As individuals with ADHD grow
older, they are vulnerable to antisocial behavior, impulsiveness,
and educational failure.
<P>
What are the symptoms of ADHD?
<P>
A child who has ADHD shows several of the following
characteristics:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- has difficulty organizing work and gives the impression he or she has not heard instructions.
<LI>-- is easily distracted.
<LI>-- makes careless, impulsive errors.
<LI>-- frequently calls out in class.
<LI>-- has difficulty awaiting his/her turn in groups.
<LI>-- fails to follow through on parents' requests.
<LI>-- is unable to play games for the same amount of time as other
<LI>children of the same age.
<LI>-- feels socially isolated from peers.
</UL>

<P>
Is ADHD associated with other neurological, biological, and
behavioral disorders?
<P>
Yes. ADHD is closely associated with:
<P>
1. At least 25 percent of children with ADHD suffer from some
type of communication/learning disability.
<P>
2. Approximately 40 percent of children with ADHD exhibit signs
of Conduct Disorder (starting fights, lying, stealing) or
Oppositional Defiant Disorder (disobedience, defiance, and rule
breaking).
<P>
3. There is a strong correlation between the neurobiological
disorder called Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. At least half of
patients with Tourette's also have ADHD, (but the opposite is not
true: half of ADHD patients do not have Tourette's).
<P>
What causes ADHD?
<P>
We don't fully know yet, but it clearly has biological
underpinnings. Many people -- including some medical
professionals, teachers, parents, and peers -- do not understand
these biological under pinnings.
<P>
They often mislabel children with ADHD as undisciplined, stupid,
lazy, or simply bad. In fact, strong scientific evidence supports
the conclusion that persons with ADHD suffer from a brain-based
biological disorder.
<P>
Examples:
<P>
1. Biochemical studies have documented that children with ADHD
have lower levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine.
<P>
2. Laboratory animal models relevant to ADHD reveal deficiencies
in a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.
<P>
3. Successful medications for ADHD affect the levels of several
neurotransmitters in the brain.
<P>
4. Brain imaging studies using PET scanners have shown that brain
metabolism is lower in patients with ADHD than in normal
controls. More important, these studies show significantly lower
metabolic activity in regions of the brain that control
attention, social judgment, and movement.
<P>
5. There is strong evidence that ADHD has a genetic basis in some
cases.
<P>
6. Environmental factors associated with ADHD include low birth
weight, hypoxia (too little oxygen) at birth, and exposure in
utero to a number of toxins including alcohol, cocaine, and
nicotine.
<P>
Although the possible relationship between ADHD and dietary
factors and food additives has been widely discussed, scientific
studies have not verified dietary factors as a main cause of
ADHD.
<P>
What treatment is available for ADHD?
<P>
A comprehensive approach is the key to successful treatment for
individuals with ADHD. Parents should derive hope from the fact
that the vast majority of patients with ADHD benefit from
treatment.
<P>
Medication is successful in more than 67 percent of all ADHD
individuals, but is best managed by a specialist in this area,
such as a child psychiatrist.
<P>
Successful medications include stimulants such as
methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and pemoline, plus
antidepressants such as imipramine.
<P>
Proper medication therapy improves attention span, controls
impulses, dampens restlessness, improves school performance,
decreases aggression, and enhances the quality of family life.
<P>
Formal educational testing and an evaluation for speech and
language disorders should be performed. Where appropriate,
parents should work with the school district to plan an
individualized education program (IEP) for their child. 
<P>
Behavioral modification strategies and special programs
addressing the cognitive deficits in children with ADHD may be
useful. Children can be offered specific incentives and rewards
for changing behavior, and specific games and exercises to
address cognitive deficits.
<P>
Children with ADHD are particularly in need of support and
encouragement. Since academics are frequently difficult for them,
they must often find other avenues to build self-esteem, such as
through sports, art, music or other special interests.
<P>
There is little evidence that psychodynamic psychotherapy alone
is effective in children with ADHD who suffer from a true
biological disorder, but there is scientific evidence for the
efficacy of several cognitive and behavioral therapies.
<P>
What can I do if a family member has ADHD?
<P>
First, cooperation and collaboration among an experienced
clinician, the school system, and the family are the keys to
developing a comprehensive, successful treatment strategy for a
child with ADHD.
<P>
Seek the advice of your child's pediatrician, school personnel,
knowledgeable friends, and national organizations such as
NAMI-CAN for a referral to a clinician who specializes in the
pharmacologic treatment of ADHD.
<P>
Educate yourself about special education programs in your state.
A new federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (Public Law 101 476) mandates that all disabled children are
entitled to "a free appropriate public education which emphasizes
special education and related services designed to meet their
unique needs."
<P>
Work with your local school district to plan a special education
program for your child.
<P>
Glossary of Terms
<P>
Conduct Disorder: Children with this disorder persistently
disregard rules and violate other's rights.
<P>
The most common behaviors are stealing, running away, lying, fire
setting, truancy from school or work, breaking into cars or
buildings, deliberate destruction of property, cruelty to animals
or people, fighting, and stealing with confrontation.
<P>
Dopamine: An important neurotransmitter in the brain. Abnormal
dopamine function has been implicated in a variety of
neurobiological disorders including ADHD, Tourette's Syndrome,
schizophrenia, and autism.
<P>
Neurotransmitter: Chemicals released from a neuron (nerve cell)
in the brain to communicate with other neurons. This chemical
transfer of information takes place in a structure called the
synapse, where parts of the neurons lie very close to one
another.
<P>
Tourette's Syndrome: An uncommon familial neurological disorder
characterized by waxing and waning motor and phonic tics plus
complex behavioral symptoms. It is likely that Tourette's is
related to abnormal functioning of several neurotransmitters in
specific parts of the brain.
<P>

<A NAME = "bipol"><H2>BIPOLAR DISORDER AND DEPRESSION</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Almost one-third of six-to-twelve-year-old children diagnosed with major depression will develop bipolar disorders within a few years, according to a study of 79 depressed children over two-to-five years reported in the May 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  Most became bipolar before the onset of puberty, and 32% became bipolar at an average age of 11 years. 
<P>
The researchers recommend that those caring for depressed children should be on the lookout for symptoms of manic-depressive illness.  They also suggested that--because antidepressants may worsen certain forms of manic illness in adults--prescribing antidepressants for children should be done with care.

<P>

<A NAME = "depre"><H2>DEPRESSION AND THE ELDERLY</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Oregon psychiatrists fear that severe depression can lead some elderly patients to make deadly, inappropriate decisions about continuation of medical treatment, according to a survey by researchers at the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center reported in the November 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry. 
<P>
More than 75 percent of Americans favor legislation allowing terminally ill patients or their family members to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, but the researchers argue that severe depression may influence patients to reject medical care they might otherwise accept if their depression were treated.  "Hopelessness leads to undervaluing all possible good outcomes for a medical treatment," said Linda Ganzini, M.D., and colleagues.  "
<P>
This study supports the hypothesis that in many depressed persons, hopelessness, pessimism and excessive emphasis on the burdens of treatment temporarily alter the person's personal formula for weighing risks and benefits of medical treatment."   Ganzini's findings offer hope that psychiatrists and other physicians can predict which depressed patients are likely to have stable or unstable preferences regarding life-sustaining therapies.
