SUMMARY OF THE ADMINISTRATION, HOUSE, AND SENATE LANGUAGE ON<BR>
 THE  DISCIPLINE OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES  IN IDEA<U><BR>
</U>(October 2, 1995)<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
I.  DRAFT DISCIPLINE LANGUAGE IN SENATE:</B></U><P>
<B>Four Categories Allowed for Placement in Interim Alternative Education Setting (IAES).  </B>A child with a disability can be placed in an IAES for not more than 45 days if the child:<P>
1.     Has a dangerous weapon in his or her possession (a weapon is defined as a weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, animate or inanimate, that is used for or is readily capable of causing death or serious bodily injury);<BR>
<BR>
2.     Sexually assaults another individual;<BR>
<BR>
3.     Engages in behavior that results in [life-threatening/serious] injury or is substantially likely to result in [life-threatening/serious] injury to another individual, where [life-threatening/serious] injury is defined as an injury involving a substantial risk of death, loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty, or a serious and protracted disfigurement; or<BR>
<BR>
4.     Engages in the illegal use, possession or distribution of drugs.<P>
<B>Additional Requirements for Sexual Assault or Life Threatening Behavior</B>.   For sexual assault or behavior that is likely to result in [life-threatening/serious] injury, there must be a written finding by a superintendent, in consultation with the special education director of the agency, other individuals with knowledge of the child and the child's disability, and the chair of the child's IEP team, that the child's behavior met the criteria for removal to an IAES.<P>
<B>Disruptive Behavior</B>.  If the agency and the child's parents do not agree to the removal of a child with a disability to an IAES because of the child's serious disruptive behavior, a hearing officer, to the same extent as a court, may order a change in placement to an IAES for not more than 45 days if the agency demonstrates that maintaining the child in the current placement is so seriously disruptive as to significantly impair the education of the child or other children.  In order for a hearing office to determine that a child is seriously disruptive, there must be a cumulative record over a [significant/reasonable] period of time describing behaviors exhibited by the child that frequently and contemporaneously prevent the child, classmates or teacher from engaging in activities; and there must be documented evidence of efforts such as reconvening of the IEP team to consider the appropriateness of the current IEP, the provision of special education and related services, the use of supplemental aids and services and strategies, including the use of behavior management plans that have been properly implemented over a [significant/reasonable] period of time and have failed to eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the behaviors of the child that were seriously disruptive.<P>
<B>Manifestation Determination.  </B>To determine the manifestation, the following factors <U>shall</U> be considered:<P>
1.     The appropriateness of the child's IEP and placement;<BR>
<BR>
2.     The extent to which the child's IEP has been implemented and has included the provision of special and related services, and the use of supplementary aids and services, strategies and interventions, and behavior management techniques; and<BR>
<BR>
3.     The extent to which the child's disability prevented the child from understanding the impact and consequences of the behavior.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
The following factors <U>may</U> be considered:<P>
1.     The extent to which the child exhibited similar behavior in the past;<BR>
<BR>
2.     Evaluation and diagnostic results, including any results supplied by the parents of the child;<BR>
<BR>
3.     Observation by a person knowledgeable about the child and the child's disability, including to the extent possible, an observation in the environment in which the behavior occurred;<BR>
<BR>
4.     The context in which the behavior at issue arose; and <BR>
<BR>
5.     The extent to which the child's disability impaired the child's ability to control the behavior at issue.<BR>
<BR>
The determination of manifestation shall be made by a group of individuals, including the child's parents, knowledgeable about the child's disability, including knowledge about the manner in which the disability is affected by the environmental factors. <B><P>
No Manifestation</B>.  If the child's behavior is found not to be a manifestation of the disability and the child has had a dangerous weapon in his or her possession or has engaged in the illegal use, possession or distribution of drugs, then the child shall be subject to the same disciplinary procedures and access to educational services as a nondisabled  child according to State and local laws.  If parents do not agree, a due process hearing may be initiated. During the pendency of the procedures, the child will continue to receive educational services.<BR>
<B><BR>
Timing and Effect of Assertion of Child's Disability.  </B>A child who has not yet been determined to be eligible for special education and related services, and who engaged in the behaviors, may assert the protection under these provisions if the State and local education agency had knowledge that the child was disabled before the behavior that precipitated disciplinary action occurred.  The following factors will be considered to determine whether the agency had knowledge about the disability:<P>
1.     The child's parents expressed concern to the agency, in writing if practicable, about the child's behavior; including but not limited to a parental request for an evaluation of their child to determine the child's eligibility for special education and related services; or<BR>
<BR>
2.     The child's teacher or other personnel expressed concern about the child's behavior to the agency's department of special education. <BR>
<BR>
If the agency had no knowledge of the child's disability, the child may be subjected to the same disciplinary actions as other children who commit comparable offenses, provided that, if a request is made for an evaluation of the child, it be done on an expedited basis.  If the child is determined to have a disability, the agency will provide special education and related services.<P>
<B>Persons Involved in the Determination of IAES.</B>  The IAES shall be decided by individuals knowledgeable about  evaluation data pertaining to the child and others knowledgeable about programming, services and placement options, which may include individuals on the IEP team, and shall include the child's parents.  The IAES shall be consistent with the right of the child to FAPE. <P>
<B>Child's Placement During Pendency.  </B>If a parent of a child with a disability requests a due process hearing, the child will remain in the IAES during the pendency of any proceedings unless the parents and LEA agree otherwise. <P>
<B>Comparability of Services.  </B>A child with a disability who is found to have engaged in the listed behaviors will have access to the same due process and educational services as children without disabilities who exhibit similar behaviors, to the extent that such due process does not conflict with, or educational opportunities are less, than those specified. <P>
<B>Referral to Juvenile Authorities.  </B>Nothing in these provisions prohibits an agency from reporting a crime committed by a child with a disability to police or juvenile authorities or to prevent State juvenile and judicial authorities from exercising their responsibilities with regard to the application of juvenile or criminal laws to crimes committed by a child with a disability. <P>
<BR>
<B><U>II.  CURRENT ADMINISTRATION/DEMOCRATIC BILL LANGUAGE ON DISCIPLINE (H.R. 1986)</B><P>
<B></U>Bringing a Weapon to School</B>.  The Administration replaces the current "a firearm" with "a dangerous weapon," allowing any child with a disability that brings a weapon to school to be placed in an IAES for not more than 45 days.   <P>
<B>Dangerous Behavior Likely to Occur</B>.  The bill also allows a hearing officer to order a change in the placement of a child with a disability to an IAES for not more than 45 days, if the public agency demonstrates by substantial evidence that maintaining the child in his or her current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to himself or herself, or to others.  If a parent requests a hearing, the child shall remain in the IAES during the pendency unless the parents and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.<P>
<B><U>III.  HOUSE REPUBLICAN DRAFT LANGUAGE</B></U><P>
<B>Dangerous Behavior Likely to Occur</B>.  The House bill would allow a hearing officer to order a change in the placement of a child with a disability to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 days if the agency demonstrates by substantial evidence that maintaining the child in his current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to himself or to others.  In ordering a change in placement, the hearing officer shall consider the appropriateness of the placement and the implementation of specific behavior management techniques identified in the child's IEP.  If the parents requests a hearing, the child would remain in the IAES during any pendency, unless the parents and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.<P>
<B>Bringing a Weapon to School or Violent Acts.  </B>The House bill also allows a child with a disability who brings a weapon (as defined by State law or State policy) to school or has committed a violent act at school, to be placed in an appropriate IAES for not more than 45 days.  The IAES shall be determined by the IEP team.    If the parents request a hearing, the child would remain in the IAES during any pendency, unless the parents and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.  <P>
<B>Manifestation of a Disability</B>.  If a change in placement or disciplinary proceedings are contemplated, a review shall be conducted within 45 days into the relationship between the child's disability and the behavior which might warrant expulsion or other appropriate disciplinary action.  In carrying out a review, the individuals shall consider appropriate factors, including:<P>
1.     The appropriateness of the child's placement;<BR>
<BR>
2.     The implementation of specific behavior management techniques identified in the IEP; <BR>
<BR>
3.     Evaluation and diagnostic results, which may include any such results supplied by the parents or guardian of the child; and<BR>
<BR>
4.     Observations.<P>
If the result of the review is a determination that the behavior of the child with a disability was a manifestation of the child's disability and the parents of such child agree with such determination, the educational placement of the child may be changed.  If the parents do not agree with the determination, an immediate appeal may be made to a hearing officer to determine whether the child's placement should be changed.  Any party aggrieved by the findings of the hearing officer may initiate a due process hearing.<P>
If the behavior was not a manifestation of the disability, the relevant disciplinary procedures applicable to children with disabilities shall be applied in the same manner in which they would be applied to children without disabilities.  If the parents do not agree, a due process hearing may be initiated.  During the pendency of the due process procedures, the child shall continue to receive educational services.
