<hr>

Food technology was first recognised as an academic discipline in the UK about forty years ago and a four-year sandwich course on this subject has been offered by The University of Reading for over twenty years.  The course syllabus has been kept under constant review and updated to keep in line with developments in the food and related industries. The syllabus summarised below is the result of a very recent review.
<P>
This course is of four years duration with a structure as shown in the following table.  Students spend a minimum of three periods training in industry as part of the course.

<b>Industrial placements</b> may be anywhere in the UK and also in many other European countries.  The University is part of  two EU schemes, Leonardo and Socrates, which support the exchange of staff and students between participating institutions.  There are occasional opportunities for training outside Europe. The Department arranges the placements taking into account the students'preferences. Normally students are paid a salary by the company with whom they are training. Most companies appoint a member of their staff to supervise the student during the placement.  Normally a member of the academic staff of the University Department will visit each student during each placement. Reports on the training are made by the student, the company and the visiting academic and on the basis of these reports the student's performance is assessed and this assessment is taken into account at the end of the course
when decisions regarding the class of degree to be awarded are being made.
<p>
Further information about industrial training is available from our <a href="/workexp/workexp.htm">Industrial Training Office</a>.
<P>
<b>The time spent in the University</b> is organised into three parts and the subjects are grouped into modules.  An outline of the course and the topics studied is as follows:
<P>
<U><B>Part 1 (two terms) modules include:</B></U>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry
<li>Computing and Mathematics
<li>Cell Biochemistry
<li>Physical Aspects of Biological Systems
<li>Molecular Biology
<li>Introductory Food Technology and Biotechnology
<li>Microbiology
</ul>

These modules in Part 1 are taken in common with students following the courses in Biotechnology and Food Science.
<p>
<b>Part 2 (three terms) modules include:<br></b> 
<ul>
<li>Biological Chemistry
<li>Food Microbiology
<li>Food Chemistry
<li>Statistics 
<li>Instrumental Analysis 
<li>Process Mathematics
<li>Nutrition
<li>Process Engineering
</ul>

Plus additional optional subjects such as: Industrial Management, Food and Nutrition Chemistry and a language.
<p>
<b>Part 3 (four terms) modules include:<br></b>
<ul>
<li>Quality Assurance
<li>Food Engineering  
<li>Sensory Analysis
<li>Developments in Food Science and Technology
<li>Food Microbiology
<li>Project
</ul>

Plus additional optional subjects such as: further Industrial Management, Advanced Food  Microbiology and Nutrition and a language.  The options available may change from year to year.
<p>
<b>Project</b><br>
Each student undertakes a project in Part 3.  This involves carrying out experimental work in one of the laboratories, under the supervision of a member of the academic staff, and writing a report on that work. Both the student’s performance and the report are assessed.
<p>
<b>Teaching<br></b>
 Students attend lectures and participate in tutorials and seminars.  These activities are supported by practical work in the science and processing laboratories.
<p>
<b>Assessment<br></b>
There is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1.  Students must pass in this in order to progress through the rest of the course.  In the event of failure in the first attempt each subject may be retaken once.  There is no formal written examination at the end of Part 2.  Modules are assessed throughout Part 2.   Students who do not perform satisfactorily in these modular assessments may be required to take a written examination .  Modules are also assessed throughout Part 3 of the course.  There is a formal written examination at the end of the course.  The class of degree awarded to each student will be based on a consideration of the results of the modular assessments in Part 2 and 3, the results of the final examination, the assessment of the student’s performance in the project and in industrial training.         
<p>
<b>Sponsorship and prizes<br></b>
A number of companies offer some financial support to students undertaking this course.  This may commence at the start of the course or at a later stage, often after a successful training placement.  There are a number of prizes awarded to students who perform very well in different aspects of the course and at different stages in it.  
<p>
<b>Entry requirements<br></b>
Two, preferably three, A-Level passes (or AS equivalents) in science subjects or mathematics.  GCSE/ O-Level mathematics is also required.  The minimum grades required are CDD.  Good attainments in other courses such as International Baccalaureate, BTEC, GNVQ or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be considered.
<p>
<b>Career opportunities<br></b>
Over one million people are employed in food and drink manufacture, distribution and sales.  A recent survey has shown that career opportunities for graduates in that industry, both in terms of salary and promotion prospects, are among the highest of all professional groups.  Opportunities arise in the manufacturing sector in research and development, production management, quality assurance, buying, marketing and sales .  Many of the large retailing companies employ our graduates to liaise with suppliers on the quality of  their products, the conditions under which they are produced and in the development of new products.  Some graduates are employed by companies supplying the food industry with ingredients, equipment and packaging.   Other opportunities occur in government establishments, with local authorities and in teaching.  Food Technology is a very useful discipline in developing countries and some of our graduates have worked for international aid organisations and charities.  Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate courses either in this University or in other UK or overseas Universities.
<p>
<b>Other courses<br></b>
The Department offers undergraduate courses in Biotechnology (4 yrs), Chemistry and Food Science (3 yrs), Food Manufacture, Management and Marketing (4 yrs), Food Science (3 yrs), Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing (3 yrs).  It also offers taught MSc courses in Food Science, Food Technology and in Food and Agricultural Biotechnology as well as research courses leading to MPhil and PhD degrees.
