<BODY>


<H2>Introduction</H2>


Chairman Jackson and Members of the Commission:<P>
<P>
When I spoke with you in January, the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program was in transition.  During the past seven months, we have revised our program approach to manage our 1996 funding reduction and to develop the long-term plan presented in the Administration's fiscal year 1997 budget request.  The results of this effort are described in the revised Program Plan released in draft form in June.<P>
<P>
We have retained the objective adopted in fiscal year 1995 to reach early convergence on the major scientific and engineering aspects of the investigation of the Yucca Mountain site.  Since January, we have also regained a long range plan that includes target dates for determining the site's suitability for recommendation for a geologic repository and, if the site designation is permitted to take effect, for submitting a license application to the Commission.  Our ability to achieve these targets, however, will continue to depend on the funding we receive in future years and the success of our approach to evaluating site suitability.  Our approach will be described in a proposed revision to the Department's siting guidelines that will be issued shortly.  It focuses on overall system performance as the basis for decisions about site suitability and repository development.<P>
<P>
Simply stated, a site cannot be judged to be "suitable" in the abstract.  At this point in the program, the only logical measure of the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site is that it be able to host a repository design that will meet the applicable standards for the protection of public health and safety.  Attributes of the site that significantly influence that capability are important.  Attributes that do not are irrelevant.  The important attributes can only be identified and evaluated within the context of an assessment of the performance of the proposed engineered repository in the specific geologic setting, as we understand that setting based on the scientific investigations done over the past decade.  Criteria of suitability, therefore, have no logical significance in isolation from a system performance assessment.<P>
<P>
Our revised program plan also defines a program of non site-specific activities that will address the long lead-time requirements of interim storage and spent fuel transportation.  These activities are consistent with the Administration's position on siting an interim storage facility.<P>


<H2>Recent Developments</H2>


<H3>Geologic Disposal</H3>


Excavation of the exploratory studies facility at Yucca Mountain continues at a satisfactory pace.  The information gained from this exploration is enhancing our understanding of the site and of the characteristics important to its potential performance as a geologic repository.<P>
<P>
We completed excavation of the main drift of the exploratory studies facility on July 2, well ahead of schedule, and the tunnel boring machine is now making the turn to proceed up the south ramp.  As of August 27, the tunnel boring machine has completed 6,294 meters (20,643 feet) of the nearly 7,900-meter (nearly 25,800-foot) loop from the north portal to the south portal of the exploratory studies facility.  Approximately 2,400 meters (7,800 feet) of this advance occurred since we met in January.  Funding constraints in fiscal year 1996 have restricted progress on tunneling somewhat, but we expect to reach the south portal of the exploratory studies facility early in 1997.<P>
<P>
We completed the initial construction phase of the thermal-testing alcove in April, and the main access and observation drift for this alcove was completed in May.  We began a small-scale (single-element) heater test in a section of this alcove on August 26.  Construction of the first of the two alcoves that will provide access to the Ghost Dance fault is well underway.  The first phase of this excavation was completed to the planned distance of 90 meters (290 feet) from the main drift on August 23.  Initial exploratory drilling in this alcove should begin this month.  Construction of the second alcove should begin in October 1996.<P>
<P>
Progress in constructing the exploratory studies facility provides our scientists the opportunity to study the geologic and hydrologic characteristics of Yucca Mountain at the depth of the potential repository.  What we have observed is consistent with the general understanding of the geology of the site that we obtained through our surface-based studies.  The structural features observed underground generally can be correlated with the faults observed at the surface.  In addition, structures at the northern end of the main tunnel, such as the Drill Hole Wash fault, are generally less significant features at repository depth than expected.  The information we have obtained indicates that there may be more area available for use at the northern end of the repository block than anticipated. <P>
<P>
Several months ago, we reported the observation of a zone of more highly fractured rock that extends for about 1,000 meters along the southern part of the main tunnel.  Preliminary information obtained from a nearby borehole indicates that the zone of fracturing does not penetrate the overlying rock units.  Although the existence of the fracture zone was not apparent from surface-based studies, such a zone is not unexpected given the geologic history and characteristics of the site.  The lack of surface evidence for this structural zone indicates that it probably formed before the uppermost rock unit was deposited, more than 12 million years ago.  The primary questions at this point relate to the extent and characteristics of the fracture zone and to the influence these characteristics may have on the repository layout and the flow of water to and through the repository.  Studies of the geologic and hydrologic characteristics of this zone, and its potential significance to repository performance, will continue as construction of the exploratory studies facility proceeds.<P>
<P>
Isotopes such as carbon-14, tritium, uranium-series elements, and chlorine-36, are being used to date fracture-fill materials and pore-water samples collected in the exploratory studies facility and from boreholes.  This testing provides data on the age of the water at various locations and on the travel time of water through preferential flow-paths, such as faults and fractures.  The data indicate that most of the water currently distributed in the rock at the potential repository horizon is old, on the order of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.<P>
<P>
In April, we reported detecting elevated levels of chlorine-36 in some rock samples collected from the exploratory studies facility.  Recognizing the possible existence of preferential flow-paths that could allow more rapid water movement, we conducted a comprehensive sampling program, collecting samples both systematically along the tunnel and at locations defined by specific features such as faults and discrete fractures.  All of the systematic samples and most of the feature-specific samples contained background levels of naturally produced chlorine-36 that indicate ground-water ages of several thousands to several hundreds of thousands of years, consistent with results from other studies.  Higher concentrations of chlorine-36 were detected, however, in some of the samples collected at five locations, all of which are associated with observable faults or discrete fractures in the rock.  These concentrations are sufficiently above background to indicate that a small amount of water containing chlorine-36 generated by atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has traveled from the surface in less than 50 years.  Chlorine-36 levels above background appear to represent more rapid flow of water along preferential pathways.  Additional samples are being collected and analyzed for chlorine-36 and other isotopes, to confirm the results and to provide information on new areas of the exploratory tunnel, including the Ghost Dance fault and the fracture zone.  Additional modeling studies will be performed to evaluate the chlorine-36 data as they relate to our understanding of hydrologic processes at Yucca Mountain and our conclusions about repository performance.<P>
<P>
In January, I noted that we were making progress refining our waste containment and isolation strategy for the Yucca Mountain site, and that we were within a few months of providing a draft to the Commission.  Although a condensed version of our updated strategy was included in the revised Program Plan, we have not yet completed the strategy.  A consensus view among Project participants could not be achieved without a fundamental re-evaluation of the need for some specific lines of scientific and engineering work.  This, in turn, led us to re-evaluate the fundamental assumptions supporting the core of the strategy.  The dialogue has been intense, and has led to iterations in defining the strategy and planning the related work.  The continuing effort to complete the strategy is, of course, serving its primary purpose by requiring the integration of the work being done and facilitating agreement on the remaining work proposed by Project participants.  An expanded version of the strategy was made available at the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board meeting on July 9 and a copy transmitted to your staff on July 19.  I expect that a detailed version of the strategy, including the definition of longer term information needs and work yet to be done that is explicitly linked to our long-range planning, will be completed in fiscal year 1997.<P>
<P>
In March, we published a report on the current level of detail for the repository and waste package advanced conceptual design.  This report gives us a new reference design based on the work performed to date.  The report depicts the major repository and waste package configurations, components, and operational concepts.  It also identifies those areas of the design requiring further refinement.  This design will serve as the benchmark for development of the design that will support the viability assessment in 1998.<P>


<H3>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</H3>


In January, I informed you of our decision not to proceed with the certification of the multi-purpose canister system for storage and transportation of commercial spent nuclear fuel.  The Administration's fiscal year 1997 budget request does not include funding for this system and we do not intend to pursue its development beyond the completion of current activities.  The final design and draft safety analysis reports were completed by Westinghouse and delivered in August.  We accepted the final reports and the work has been completed for Phase 1 of the contract.  The results will be made available to other parties that may wish to pursue certification at their own expense.  We believe that such certifications would be in the public interest and would enhance the range of options in the marketplace.  The introduction of additional technology options would increase competition and provide a greater return on the public investment already made.<P>
<P>
The Department recognizes that the multi-purpose canister technology may be useful in the management of the Department's own spent fuel.  The Department's Office of Environmental Management has provided Westinghouse with $1 million in fiscal year 1996 to update the large transportation cask design so it is consistent with the most recent multi-purpose canister specification.  These modifications will provide an option for placing Department-owned fuel in interim storage in a form that is technically compatible with the current expectations for disposal.


<H2>Revised Program Approach</H2>


In December 1994, we published the <A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/intro/planltr.htm"><CITE>Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</CITE></A>.  That plan outlined our approach to accomplishing the Program's principal objectives with reasonable target dates and at substantially reduced cost compared with earlier estimates.  I discussed this approach with the Commission in December 1994 and June 1995.  As noted in my comments before this Commission in January 1996, the decisions made in the fiscal year 1996 budget process made it impossible to continue that approach. <P>
<P>
In response to the fiscal year 1996 appropriation and the Congressional direction to concentrate on the major unresolved technical questions regarding geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain, we released a revision to the <CITE> Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</CITE> on June 12, 1996.  Our revised Plan is supported by the President's fiscal year 1997 budget, which requested $400 million for the Program in 1997, $339 million of which would be allocated to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project.  Congressional appropriations action for 1997 is not yet complete.  The House has approved a bill that, with certain contingencies, would provide $382 million for the Program.  The Senate has passed an appropriation bill that provides the full $400 million requested.<P>
<P>
We are still without agreement between the Administration and Congress on a new policy for the near-term management of spent nuclear fuel.  Congress continues to consider legislation that would initiate an interim storage program.  Just before it recessed, the Senate passed a bill that calls for construction of an interim storage facility near Yucca Mountain after the 1998 repository viability assessment and with additional provisions if the President decides the site is not viable.  The Administration has restated its opposition to this bill and to the House Commerce Committee bill, reported last October, that calls for the immediate construction of an interim storage facility near Yucca Mountain.  The outcome for the pending legislation by the end of this Congressional session is uncertain.<P>
<P>
Various utilities and a group of states and public utility commissions sought a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that the Department is obligated under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to begin disposing of the utilities' spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998.  In a decision issued in July, the Court agreed with the utilities, holding that the Act creates an obligation in the Department, reciprocal to the utilities' obligation to pay fees, to start disposing of spent nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998.  The Court rejected the Department's position that it does not have an obligation in the absence of a repository or other facility constructed under the Act.  The Court remanded the case to the Department for further proceedings, stating that it would be premature for a court to attempt to fashion an appropriate remedy, since the Department is not currently in default on the obligation.  The Department is reviewing the Court's ruling to determine what steps it should now take.<P>


<H3>Geologic Disposal</H3>


Our revised Program Plan describes a focused program that regains a target for a license application for a repository at Yucca Mountain, if the site is suitable.  The revised program is based on an increased technical understanding of the repository from more than a decade of scientific and engineering work at Yucca Mountain.  Our site investigations and total system performance assessments have allowed us to reach much better informed judgements regarding the specific aspects of the site that are significant to performance.  These judgments have enabled us to reduce the work required to support regulatory decisions and thereby accommodate a substantial reduction in future funding with minimal slippage in schedule.<P>
<P>
The 1988 Site Characterization Plan for Yucca Mountain established the initial basis for our characterization of the site.  Given the information then available on site conditions, the formative nature of the repository and waste package design concepts and the developmental status of our performance assessment capabilities, our initial approach to planning a site characterization program was to make it sufficiently comprehensive to minimize the potential for gaps in the information ultimately found to be necessary.  As expected, our plans have evolved significantly since 1988 based on what we have learned from our scientific studies and design work.  Beginning in February 1990, we have provided information on the nature and results of our site characterization activities in our semiannual progress reports.<P>
<P>
Because of our enhanced understanding of site conditions, we have continued to refine our strategy for evaluating the site's ability to contain and isolate waste.  Our understanding has made it possible for us to refine the remaining work scope needed to support our viability assessment, as well as our subsequent evaluation of site suitability, and preparation of a license application for submittal to the Commission.  By 1998, we will have assembled and analyzed the wealth of scientific data that is available and updated our assessment of the performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain.  We will also have developed a repository design and assessed the technical and economic feasibility of constructing the repository.  If the repository appears to be viable based on our assessment of this information, we will complete the work necessary to determine the site's suitability and, if suitable, to make a formal recommendation of the site to the President in 2001 and submit a license application to the Commission by 2002.<P>
<P>
The revised Program Plan describes the overall approach for the technical and regulatory changes that will bring the program into alignment with the direction received from the Administration and Congress, and with our current knowledge about the site and repository design.  This plan defines three objectives that will maintain the momentum toward a national decision on the geologic disposal option:<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Update the regulatory framework in 1997 for evaluating the suitability of Yucca Mountain;
<LI>Complete the viability assessment in 1998;
<LI>Recommend the repository site to the President in 2001 if the site is suitable, and submit a license application to the Commission in 2002. 
</UL>


<H4>Update the regulatory framework for evaluating the suitability of Yucca Mountain</H4>


The regulatory framework developed after enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982 was heavily influenced by the initial requirement of the Act to screen a number of candidate repository sites and select the most promising sites for further action.  The 1987 amendment to the Act directed us to evaluate only a single specific site.  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a site-specific radiation protection standard for a repository at Yucca Mountain.  This requirement signals a broad change to the regulatory framework for repository development, shifting it from a generic to a site-specific basis for evaluation and decision-making.  The Energy Policy Act also directs the Commission to revise its licensing requirements to be consistent with the site-specific standard.<P>
<P>
To respond to the policy changes, and supported by our increased understanding of the Yucca Mountain site, we have decided to revise our siting guidelines (10 CFR Part 960).  The guidelines will be revised through a public rulemaking process initiated by a notice of proposed rulemaking later this year.  Our goal is to publish the final rule in 1997.  As was done during the 1984 promulgation of the siting guidelines, we will obtain the Commission's concurrence with the revised guidelines, and we will work with your staff to facilitate this action.<P>
<P>
Site "characterization" and site "suitability" initially focused on a set of hypothesized characteristics that were considered to be indications of greater or lesser probability that any site could successfully host a repository. These characteristics were selected based upon very preliminary comprehension of the technical factors affecting repository performance.  Their selection was also influenced by the need to address generic conditions even though any particular characteristic might have very different significance when applied to sites in diverse geologic settings.<P>
<P>
In the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1987, the program was directed to evaluate only the Yucca Mountain site.  As a result, the comparative nature of the site characterization process lost its logical basis.  Some of the generic characteristics specified for evaluation proved to be of limited utility in terms of evaluating performance in the unique geologic setting of the Yucca Mountain site, and in terms of the evolving waste isolation strategy for a specific engineered facility in that geologic setting. The appropriate measure of the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site, therefore, is the total system performance of a proposed repository design that can be implemented in that site-specific geologic setting compared to the applicable regulatory standards for public health and safety and environmental protection.  That measure will capture the relevant attributes of the site.  The revised siting guidelines will rely upon the radiation protection standard for Yucca Mountain as the ultimate criterion of site suitability for the evaluation of postclosure system performance.<P>
<P>
We have been interested in your staff's recent discussions with the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste and with this Commission on their preliminary consideration of significant and possible site-specific changes to the Commission's licensing requirements.  We are particularly interested in and support the consideration of changes that would result in a simple, risk-based rule, with a single quantitative criterion for postclosure performance.  Any rule change should also recognize that site conditions cannot be evaluated in isolation from the assessment of performance and that probabilistic arguments will need to be used in demonstrating compliance with the Commission's technical criteria.  We discussed our general views on changes in the licensing requirements with your staff at our management meeting in July.  We plan to continue our interactions with the staff during their preliminary consideration of the available options.


<H4>Complete the viability assessment in 1998</H4>


The near-term activities in our program plan for the Yucca Mountain project are focused on addressing the major unresolved technical questions associated with the overall performance of a repository so that, by 1998, we can make an informed assessment of the viability of licensing and constructing a repository.  The work supporting the viability assessment will include four components:  (1) a package of more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository concept and the waste package;  (2) a total system performance assessment, based upon that design concept and upon the scientific data and analysis that will be available to us by 1998, which will describe the probable behavior of the repository in the Yucca Mountain geologic setting;  (3) an upgraded estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository in accordance with the design;  and (4) a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license application.<P>
<P>
The first component addresses design elements that are critical to determining the feasibility and performance of the repository and the engineered barrier system.  We will evaluate the technological feasibility of the designs, but we will not yet have the detail needed for licensing.  The designs will build on the Advanced Conceptual Design Report that we published in March.  The emphasis will be on the aspects of the design that affect waste containment and isolation, and that are major considerations for repository cost.  These aspects include management of the waste-generated heat and its effects, corrosion of waste packages, and the need for and feasibility of supplemental engineered barriers.  The effort will address concepts for waste-retrieval operations, performance-confirmation requirements, safety systems, and other factors that significantly affect repository cost.<P>
<P>
The second component is an updated total system performance assessment based on our design concept and the analyses of the available site and engineering data.  The primary objective of this assessment is to evaluate the probable performance of the repository.  An additional objective is to further refine our evaluation of repository performance under a range of both normal conditions and conditions likely to be imposed by potentially disruptive events.  Sensitivity analyses will be performed to refine our strategy for the evaluation of waste containment and isolation.  We will also identify areas where significant uncertainties exist and, where possible, the means to reduce these uncertainties for the license application or as part of a performance confirmation program.  A phased peer review of our performance assessment results will be initiated later this year.  Detailed planning for this review has already begun and work will start in October.  The comments and recommendations available from the early stages of the peer review will be incorporated, as appropriate, in the total system performance assessment as it is developed for the viability assessment.  The comments and recommendations from later review cycles will be incorporated into the assessment that supports the site recommendation and preparation of the license application.<P>
<P>
The third component is the cost estimate for the repository system, which will cover activities through repository closure and decommissioning.  The life-cycle cost estimate will provide information for policy decisions regarding the feasibility of continuing with licensing and construction of a geologic repository.<P>
<P>
The fourth component is the license application plan, which will define the actions required and the scientific and engineering information that may be needed to complete a license application for submittal to the Commission.  The preparation of the license application plan will also provide an opportunity to assess the adequacy of our revised approach to site characterization and design, and the effectiveness of updates to the regulatory framework.<P>
<P>
The completion of these components constitutes a logical convergence point at which the program can make a measurably improved appraisal of the prospects for geologic disposal at the Yucca Mountain site.  The Administration has stated its position that this appraisal should be available to inform any decision concerning the site for a Federal interim storage facility for commercial spent nuclear fuel.  Pending legislation also recognizes the assessment as a significant benchmark in the program.



<H4>Recommend the site to the President in 2001, if the site is suitable, and submit a license application to the Commission in 2002</H4>



The goal of submitting a successful license application to the Commission remains central to the Program's mission.  The work completed for the viability assessment will be an integral step on the path to a license application.  That body of work, augmented in later years, will serve as the foundation for our evaluation of site suitability, an environmental impact statement, a Secretarial site recommendation to the President, and a license application to the Commission. <P>
<P>
An environmental impact statement must accompany the Secretary's site recommendation to the President and the license application to the Commission.  We published a Notice of Intent in the Federal Register in August 1995, initiating the public comment period on the proposed scope of the repository environmental impact statement.  The public comment period closed in December 1995 and, as I noted in January, further action was deferred because of the reduced funding for fiscal year 1996.  Our revised Program Plan now calls for resuming work on the environmental impact statement in fiscal year 1997, with publication of the draft statement in 1999 and the final statement in 2000.<P>
<P>
If the site is determined to be suitable, a decision by the Secretary to recommend the site is expected in 2001.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires that the Secretary's recommendation consider the Commission's preliminary comments on the sufficiency of our at-depth site characterization analysis and waste form proposal for inclusion in a license application.<P>
<P>
Under our revised Program Plan, a Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be prepared to integrate the technical elements of the program.  This document will describe and integrate information on site conditions, repository and waste package design, and performance assessment.  The document will be provided to the Commission in 1999 for review as one basis for its preliminary comments on the sufficiency of information on the site and design for inclusion in a repository license application.  The Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be used as the starting point for development of our license application.<P>
<P>
Although we were unable to proceed with work on the licensing support system in fiscal year 1996, our revised Program Plan includes a budget and schedule for system development, with work beginning again in fiscal year 1997.  The licensing support system is intended to meet the Commission's requirements for access to the comprehensive documentation required for the licensing proceedings before submittal of an application.  We understand that the Commission is reviewing the current requirements for the licensing support system and may be contemplating changes to these requirements.  Changes that will allow use of the significant advances in computer technology and connectivity (such as the World-Wide-Web) that have occurred since these requirements were last revised in 1991 would be welcome.<P>
<P>
Certification of the licensing support system by the Commission's system administrator is required at least six months before a license application is submitted.  Our current plans will allow us to have a computer-based licensing support system in place that meets the Commission's current requirements and available for certification by November 1999.  Although our schedule is aggressive, we understand that the requirements may change and will continue to interact with your staff as it explores new approaches to system development.  I commend the Commission for taking a leadership role in defining and implementing positive solutions to the problem of document availability, and urge you to continue your involvement in the process for development of the licensing support system.


<H4>Revised Program Approach to Licensing </H4>


Over the past seven months, both of our organizations have been reacting to the changes directed in the high-level waste program.  During this period, and in spite of the funding constraints on the scope of our activities, I believe that our staff interactions have become better focused and more useful.  I hope that we can continue to build on this progress as we implement our revised program approach.<P>
<P>
 The products associated with the viability assessment will facilitate a measurably improved understanding of the repository concept and a comprehensive appraisal of the prospects for licensing and constructing a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain.  Although the information collected will not yet be sufficient for licensing, the work leading to the viability assessment provides a logical approach to developing a first-of-a-kind repository.  In completing the work products associated with this assessment, we will define a repository concept that includes a facility and waste package design consistent with the characteristics of the Yucca Mountain site, and an assessment of the performance of this repository.  We will examine alternatives and propose the best repository system that can be achieved within rational cost and schedule constraints.  It is appropriate for us to complete the technical work, develop a concept, and satisfy ourselves of its ability to adequately protect public health and safety before we seek approval from outside parties. <P>
<P>
From our perspective, our interactions with your staff should focus on two objectives.  First, we hope to reach a common understanding regarding the issues that are significant to the overall performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain.  Second, we hope to reach agreement on the adequacy of the methodologies we are using and the approaches we are taking to address important technical issues such as criticality control and seismic design.  The goal is to reach a mutual understanding of the developing repository concept that will provide a basis for the Commission's preliminary comments on the sufficiency of our site characterization analysis and design for inclusion in a license application.<P>
<P>
This approach is a departure from previous efforts that focused on resolving individual issues related to specific site characteristics in isolation from one another or from a specific design concept.  In my view, the lack of a conceptual frame of reference for discussion has been a source of discomfort in previous interactions with the Commission.  The sufficiency of site characterization data and analyses generally can only be determined within the context of a coherent repository concept that includes both a design and an assessment of its performance.  Therefore, we will concentrate first on developing the overall concept for the repository system, and on communicating our progress to your staff, rather than on reaching agreement regarding the sufficiency of our data and analyses to address isolated issues related to specific site characteristics in advance of such a concept.  The staff's insights regarding these issues, however, would help ensure that there will be sufficient information in a subsequent license application.  We expect that the staff will inform us of issues that are not being considered or that are not receiving appropriate emphasis from a licensing perspective as they review the results of our system performance analyses.<P>
<P>
We will discuss our approaches and methodologies for dealing with specific technical issues.  We expect the staff's feedback on the adequacy of our proposed approaches and methods for use in a licensing proceeding.  We plan to continue development of a limited number of topical reports, with the goal of receiving staff safety evaluation reports that can be referenced in a license application as an appropriate means for resolving selected issues.


<H3>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</H3>


In the portions of our revised program approach outside of the Yucca Mountain Project, we will continue working toward staff acceptance of our actinide-only burnup credit topical report.  In response to your staff's comments, we are performing additional analyses using existing data from the nuclear industry, including foreign burnup credit experience.  Our responses to the staff's questions on the topical report will be completed later this calendar year.  We will also continue our work on the development and demonstration of the capability for dry transfer of spent fuel.  We will complete a topical safety analysis report for a stand-alone dry transfer system that could be used at both utility and federal sites, and submit it to your staff later this year for review and acceptance.<P>
<P>
Any future scenario of interim storage, or ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, will require a national transportation effort.  Over the past seven months, we have developed a revised strategy that will enable us to acquire the capability to accept, store, and transport spent nuclear fuel as rapidly and efficiently as possible when a federal storage or disposal facility is available.  The strategy is in accordance with the Administration's objectives for re-engineering government and greater privatization of Federal activities.<P>
<P>
In the near-term, we will be concentrating upon two major activities:<P>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Develop a market-driven waste acceptance, storage, and transportation approach that relies on the private sector for implementation.
<LI>Conduct non-site-specific design and engineering analyses for an interim storage facility to reduce facility licensing time, if such a facility is authorized.
</UL>

<P>
In May, we published a request in the Federal Register and the Commerce Business Daily for expressions of interest and comments on our plans to develop a market-driven transportation capability.  In July, we met with the interested parties to discuss these plans and to receive comments to assist in shaping the concept.  Under the approach discussed, we would contract with private industry to provide equipment and services for delivering spent fuel to an interim storage facility or repository.<P>
<P>
We are also currently developing a topical safety analysis report for the first phase of an interim storage facility based on a non-site-specific design for receipt and storage of spent fuel in transportable storage casks or canisters.  We will submit this topical report in fiscal year 1997.  We believe that the staff's acceptance of the topical safety analysis report for the initial phase of facility operations will reduce the time required for subsequent preparation of a license application and staff review of a site-specific design and related safety considerations.<P>
<P>
The second stage of the strategy involves work that should be accomplished after a site is designated.  Implementation of this stage is contingent upon Presidential and Congressional agreement on the necessary authority and funding.  Our Program Plan assumes that agreement would be reached in 1999, consistent with the Administration's position that a siting decision should be based on objective criteria and informed by an appraisal of the viability of the Yucca Mountain repository.


<H2>Conclusion</H2>


In our revised Program Plan, we have begun to accommodate the significant changes that are needed to focus the activities and maintain the momentum of the repository program.  If there is an aspect of the site that contradicts our expectations about the performance of a repository at Yucca Mountain, we are likely to discover it by 1998 through the work performed for the viability assessment.  If there are shortcomings in the available technologies or in our ability to implement the repository design concepts, they will be evident by then.  With adequate funding and an updated regulatory process for the evaluation of site suitability and repository licensing, I am confident that, if the site is suitable, we can achieve our target date of 2002 for the submittal of a license application to the Commission.  We have also developed plans and initiated activities that should enable us to respond efficiently and effectively to new authority on interim storage, once a conclusion is reached on the viability of the repository undertaking.<P>

Thank you for the opportunity to brief the Commission.  I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.<P>
