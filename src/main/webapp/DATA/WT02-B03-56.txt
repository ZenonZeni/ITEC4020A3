<H1>Chesapeake Bay, Maryland</H1><H3> Introduction</H3>
The Maryland Geophysical Survey requested a QTC VIEW demonstration to evaluate digital technology for sediment classification in the coastal and estuarine environments of Chesapeake Bay. The trial was performed off Solomans Island where the Survey had previously completed extensive single and multibeam bathymetric studies and seabed sampling.<P> 
<H3>Equipment</H3>
Installed on the 16 m survey vessel R.V. Discovery, the QTC VIEW was connected in parallel with a Furuno FCV582 200 kHz sounder and 8° beam width transducer. The sounder had eight manual ranges with pulse durations from .1 ms to 1.4 ms and ping rates from 100 to 10 per second. Maximum output power was 500 watts RMS.<P> As the survey area had depth ranges from 
7 to 42 meters, the fourth range was selected with a pulse duration of .3 ms and a ping rate of 6 per second. A NMEA 0183, GGA navigation string was sent to the 486 DX2-66 laptop which logged and displayed both seabed classification information and GPS data.<P> 
<H3>Area</H3>
Chesapeake Bay is one of the largest inland coastal waterways in the United States. It covers approximately 14,000 square miles and has an average depth of 7 m. The Bay is predominately mud with areas of fine and medium grain sand. The survey area was located five miles east northeast from Solomans Island. <P> 
<H3>Calibration</H3>
The QTC VIEW was calibrated at four sites. Two grab samples were collected at each site to accurately characterize the seabed type. Site 1 was in 7.6 m of water and consisted of mud with 5% fine sand. Site 2 was in 14.7 m of water and consisted of a silty clay. The seabed at site 3 was a gas-charged mud in 36 m of water. When viewed on a colour echo sounder, there was little difference in the acoustic signature between sites 2 and 3. Site 4 was fine sand in 7 m of water. <P> 
<H3>Operations</H3>
A catalogue containing four classes was compiled and a survey line run from east-west over the various seabed types. The line was approximately 12 km in length and was run at vessel speeds from 3 to 14 knots. Seas were calm with little tidal action during the survey. <P> 
<H3>Results</H3>
From extensive surveys of the area, MGS personnel knew where the seabed transitions were located. The QTC VIEW showed the exact location of each transition and accurately distinguished between the four seabed types. During data acquisition, a number of grab samples were taken and confirmed the system's accuracy. <P>
<H3>Summary</H3>
Two interesting aspects of the QTC VIEW operational abilities were observed during this trial.  Firstly, the system was able to characterize gas-charged sediments. Secondly, the QTC VIEW was able to collect high quality data at vessel speeds of 14 knots without sacrificing data quality.<P></TD><TD>&#160;&#160;</TD></TR></TABLE>
