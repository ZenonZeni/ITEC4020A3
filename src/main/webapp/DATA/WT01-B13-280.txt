A financial representative can become your trusted partner for the
long-run. He or she will get to know you and work with you, to help you
reach a lifetime of financial goals.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Here's what you should expect from the start...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>A detailed analysis of your financial situation.</STRONG> Your representative can
examine your current investments, income and tax situation, to analyze
your current level of "fiscal fitness."
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>A clear definition of your goals.</STRONG> Together, you and your financial
representative can formalize your goals - for the near-term (buy a new
house in a few years?), and for the long-run (college for children?
retirement?).
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>An individualized strategy to help reach your goals.</STRONG> Most likely, your
investment plan will include a combination of investments that address
your time and safety requirements. Your portfolio will be uniquely yours
- geared toward helping to meet your financial needs now, and later. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Regular portfolio reviews.</STRONG>
You and your financial representative should periodically review your
investments to be sure you're on track to reaching your goals.
Similarly, you should talk with your representative throughout various
life stages. Marriage, new babies, retirement, aging parents, new jobs -
all of these might warrant a change in your investment strategy.
<BR><BR>
