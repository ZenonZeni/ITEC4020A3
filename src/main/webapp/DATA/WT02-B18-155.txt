</B>
<P>
Vaxcel, Inc. today announced the initiation
of a Phase I human clinical trial of Optivax&reg; at a comprehensive
cancer center. This trial is the first time Vaxcel's Optivax
vaccine adjuvant has been tested in humans.

<P>
Optivax is Vaxcel's proprietary vaccine
delivery and adjuvant system that is based on synthetic copolymers.
In preclinical studies, Optivax has been shown to improve the
effectiveness of a variety of different vaccines. This Phase I
clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the safety and activity
of Optivax administered in combination with a  human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) based vaccine in patients with metastatic cancer.
The trial will be performed using escalating doses of Optivax
to determine the optimal human dose. The hCG vaccine for the trial
is being supplied by ImmunoTherapy Corporation of Tustin, California.

<P>
“To date, we have documented the safety
and effectiveness of the Optivax adjuvant in preclinical evaluations,”
commented Dr. Mark Newman, Vaxcel's Vice President of Research
and Development. “We expect this Phase I clinical trial
will confirm these results in humans.”

<P>
Vaxcel is engaged in the development and commercialization
of the Optivax System and offers field-of-use licenses to companies
developing new vaccines or improving existing ones. The company
currently has option agreements with Connaught Laboratories, Inc.
and Medeva PLC to evaluate and develop human vaccines using Optivax.
Vaxcel is a wholly owned subsidiary of CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:
CYTR).

<P>
CytRx Corporation and its subsidiaries are
engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products. In addition
to Vaxcel, CytRx has two other subsidiaries. Vetlife is developing
products to enhance food animal growth. Proceutics provides high
quality preclinical development services to the pharmaceutical
industry.
