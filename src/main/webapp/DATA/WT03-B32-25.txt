@INTERNET: LOOKING AHEAD AT THE INTERNET
Predictions about the most important developmental issues for 1996

By:
Thom Stark

I devoted my first column of 1995 to a discussion of the things I thought
would most affect the development of the Internet in the year ahead.
Because I'm an aficionado of tradition, it's time for me to dust off my
crystal ball; make a few mystic passes; and try to define the events,
technologies, and trends that will most significantly affect the evolution
of the Internet in 1996.
   Perhaps I should begin by evaluating the predictions I made in 1995. In
last January's column, ``The Constant of the Internet Is Change'' (Jan. 23,
1995, Page 79) I speculated that the two key developments of the year would
be the defunding of the NSFnet backbone and the rollout of the Microsoft
Network (MSN).
   My NSFnet thesis was that the shutdown would free the Internet from the
constraints known as ``appropriate use''--the policy that no commercial
traffic should use the taxpayer-funded NSF high-speed backbone--and thereby
open the Internet to general business uses. It's fair to say I was right on
this one. If anything, I underestimated the impact that removing the
constraints on business uses would have on the character of the Internet in
general and the World Wide Web in particular.
   My other prediction was that Microsoft Corp.'s bundling of MSN with
Windows 95 would put the company in position to successfully dictate
standards to the Internet, bypassing the Internet Society's
consensus-oriented IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) process.
   With Microsoft having voluntarily limited MSN subscriptions to 500,000
users through the end of November 1995 and with the slow adoption of
Windows 95 by the corporate users Microsoft was counting on, I'd have to
say I blew it on this one. Although it's probably true that the perceived
threat of MSN was a critical factor in motivating other online services,
particularly America OnLine Inc. and CompuServe Inc., to roll out enhanced
Internet services of their own--and in CompuServe's case, to radically
restructure its pricing--the effect of MSN on Microsoft's capability to
dictate standards was indiscernible. Much to my surprise, the standards
bully turned out to be Netscape Communications Corp., maker of the wildly
successful Netscape Navigator.
   Netscape has come under intense criticism from the IETF community for
becoming ``the Microsoft of the World Wide Web'' because of its proprietary
extensions to existing and proposed HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
standards (http://home.mcom.com/assist/nettes/htmltensionshtml).
   You wouldn't know it from the widespread adoption of those very
extensions (how many Web sites have you seen that feature blinking text,
background images, or variable-width horizontal rules?), but there's a fair
amount of resentment on the part of old Internet types of what is viewed as
Netscape's high-handed imposition of its proprietary HTML tags on the
standards promulgation process.
   Unfortunately for the old guard, I think this trend will continue in
1996. In fact, I think the mossbacks will lose this one by a knock- out.
The newly released Navigator 2.0 (ftp://ftp1.netscape.com/netscape/)
incorporates still newer, Netscape-proprietary tags, such as frames
(http://home.mcom.com/assist/nettes/frames.html), that I think the
Web-building community will rush to adopt wholesale. The old IETF
decision-by-consensus mechanism is simply too slow and cumbersome for the
warp-speed evolution rate of the Web. I'm afraid that consensus will wind
up taking a permanent back seat to expediency on this and other Web-related
issues. The major question is this: Besides Netscape, who else will get to
drive?
Microsoft is pitching Internet Explorer 2.0
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ download/msie20.exe), which uses
client-side image maps in a proprietary fashion different from the Netscape
method. Microsoft offers tags to create scrolling marquees and for playing
and controlling embedded Audio-Video Interleave (AVI) movies
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie20html.htm).
   Unfortunately for Microsoft, I suspect that the attraction of marquees
won't be strong enough to persuade Netscape's loyal user base to abandon
the greater flexibility of frames and plug-ins. As for AVIs, the charm of
animation will, in many users' minds, be far outweighed by the cost in time
to download these often-huge files at the agonizing pace of 14.4Kbps.
   This brings up another battle that's looming on the horizon in 1996: The
number of Web sites implementing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java
(http://java.sun.com) programming language applets vs. those offering
similar functionality via Microsoft's equally proprietary Blackbird
technology. Again, I think the road ahead for Bill Gates' gang is a rocky
one. Netscape Navigator 2.0, which already owns an enormous share of the
Web browser marketplace, natively supports Java. Microsoft's Blackbird, on
the other hand, isn't even supported by its own Internet Explorer. By the
time Microsoft makes it onto the battlefield, the war will be over and Sun
will have won.

Brilliant Browsers
   Unless I miss my guess, one of the more important trends of 1996 will be
the integration of additional service functionality into the Web browser
user interface. As Marc Andreessen agreed in a LAN Times interview (``The
Great Netscape,'' April 24, 1995, Cover), the role of the Web browser is
rapidly expanding to consolidate E-mail, ftp (File Transfer Protocol), news
reader, Internet Relay Chat, and other Internet services that used to
require separate applications. This should be good news for corporate LAN
environments, where that unified interface should reduce the complexity of
training and help-desk support needed by the user community.
   Finally, there's the rise of the corporate intranet. The twin
technologies of the Web and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)-based
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions-enhanced Internet-standard
E-mail deserve a place in the corporate LAN environment. One offers an
easy, inexpensive means of enterprisewide document publication. The other
promises to free us from the tyranny of proprietary mail transports and
file-attachment schemes.
   Are the prospects for a sub-$500 Internet access terminal turning into
the next big development in Internet technology? I think that, instead, the
so-called ``3270-Jr.'' is more likely to be the next pen-based personal
digital assistant--an engineering driven solution in search of a problem.

Illustration(s):
Screen: The sheer momentum of Netscape is dashing the hopes of such
Internet contenders as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.

@INTERNET: `CHERRY-PICKED' INTERNET

   Charles Mbacha, technical systems analyst with Standard Chartered Bank
in Nairobi, Kenya, writes:
   I just read Thom Stark's article on ``Best-of-Breed Internet
Applications'' (Oct. 9, 1995, Page 101). I wonder, however, whether one
should wait until the ``hype'' about best-of-breed Internet applications
has died down a little bit. Then one could go for a product that seems to
be robust enough and incorporates at least 95 percent of the features that
users need, such as substring searching, cross-posting to multiple groups,
virtual terminals, key remapping, dial-up support for NDIS (network driver
interface specification), and rule-based filtering.
   Could you recommend an approach to this selection minefield?

Thom Stark responds:
   Unfortunately, the hype surrounding computer applications of all kinds
doesn't look to fade away any time soon. In fact, that was kind of my point
 ... along with the fact that no single vendor has a best-of-breed solution
to offer across the board. Where news readers are concerned, I stand by my
recommendation of Forte Inc.'s Agent/Free Agent product. Most everyone
agrees that Qualcomm Inc.'s Eudora is the E-mail front end to use. And
Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator is clearly the best World Wide
Web browser on the market.
   The principal drawback to this ``cherry-picking'' approach is that you
have no centralized source of support other than your internal help desk.
Unfortunately, the pick-and-choose approach is the right one, at the
moment.
   The real issue is that this market is evolving at a breathtaking rate.
Applications developers of all sizes are climbing aboard the Internet
bandwagon, so the competition will be heating up, not declining, for some
time to come. With competition there inevitably comes hype.
   The best advice I can give you is to haunt USENET groups and ask for
advice from other users, look at the comparisons in trade magazines (but
take them with a barrel of salt), and ask companies for evaluation copies
of their software.

LAN ANSWERS: DUPLEXED DUPLEXING QUESTIONS
Plus, copy with hop counts and overflowing SYS: volumes

By:
Al Berg

   Welcome to 1996! Because January was named for the Roman god Janus, who
showed true system fault tolerance by having not one, but two faces, it
seems fitting to start off the new year with not one, but two duplexing
questions:
   Q. Mark Meyer, a vice president with Suburban Air Freight Inc. in Omaha,
Neb., writes: ``We run a Novell Inc. NetWare 3.12 network, and I have set
up duplexed drives in the server. My problem is I cannot figure out how the
duplexing is designed to work in the event of a drive malfunction.
   ``Novell says to unmirror the drives and use the good one if one drive
fails, but they do not say how to determine which drive is good or how to
rebuild the system. I would assume that there is a simple explanation on
how to use the duplexed drives when there is a problem, but I have not
found it. Any input you can provide on the problem or location of this
information would be appreciated.''

   A. The reason Novell's documentation is terse on the subject of
procedures for duplexing is that the process is mostly automatic. Here's
how things are supposed to work: When you set up two drives in a duplexed
configuration, all of the data written to drive A is also written to drive
B. (You can set up duplexing to more than two drives for even more security
and fault tolerance, but I have never seen that configuration in the
field.)
When LAN clients make disk-read requests, NetWare takes advantage of the
two disk drives and uses both to satisfy those requests in the most
efficient manner, yielding a significant per-formance improvement over
non-duplexed drives.
   When one drive in a duplexed pair fails, NetWare simply issues a couple
of error messages to the file-server console and system-error log and
starts operating in nonduplexed mode, using the remaining drive. Users will
not see any real difference in the operation of the LAN, except for a drop
in performance on disk reads.
   Here's where the element of danger arrives: It is extremely easy to miss
the error message that tells you your server is flying on one engine. If
the message scrolls off the screen and you (like many system managers)
don't periodically monitor your error log or use a server-monitoring
product such as Frye Computer Systems Inc.'s NetWare Early Warning System,
HiTecSoft Corp.'s ManageWare, or Network Computing Inc.'s LANAlert, you may
not know about the failed drive until it is too late--when your remaining
drive fails, and there is no backup. I can't count the number of sites I
have responded to where I ran into this situation. The moral of the story:
Keep an eye on the system-error log or install some software to do it for
you.
   Assuming you know that drive B has failed, the fix is simple: Bring the
server down at a convenient time (if your drives are not hot-swappable),
pop in a new drive, and create a NetWare partition on it. Then load the
INSTALL.NLM and select Disk Options and then Mirroring. Look for the
partitions marked Not Mirrored in the list that appears. Pressing `Enter'
on one of these partition listings will bring up a menu. Press `Insert' to
choose the other nonmirrored partition as the other half of the duplexed
pair. The remirroring process will begin automatically, bringing the two
drives into sync. While the server is remirroring, performance will be
slow, so it is a good idea to do this at night.
   Some people get confused by the seemingly interchangeable use of the
terms mirroring and duplexing in NetWare. Let's straighten this out once
and for all: The difference between mirroring and duplexing is simply that
with duplexing, the disks in a mirrored pair are on separate controllers.
Duplexing offers protection against a controller failure and improved read
performance.

   Q. Our second duplexing question comes from Ed Villanueva, a
self-described ``con- fused CNE'' at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. He
asks: ``What is the proper way to set up disk duplexing? Should the two
disk controllers have the same interrupt and base memory locations, or
should they be different? Should I load the disk drivers twice?''

   A. The answer to Ed's question points out the difference between
server-hardware settings and NetWare settings. The disk-controller card
settings, such as interrupt numbers and memory base addresses, need to be
unique to allow the server to differentiate between the two cards. In most
cases, putting two cards at the same interrupt or base memory address will
lead to immediate problems, such as one or both cards not being seen by the
operating system.
   Duplexing is done at the operating-system partition level. The members
of a duplexed pair of disks are identified by the ID numbers of the NetWare
partitions on them, not the settings of the disk controllers. You'll need
to load the disk driver software for each controller card installed in your
server (identified by the slot or card settings) to make the system see all
of the drives.
   If you want the inside scoop on mirroring and duplexing, including some
important information on what to do when things don't go as planned, check
out Novell's October 1992 NetWare Application Notes (part number
164-000031-010). On Page 1, you'll find a great article titled ``NetWare
3.x Mirroring and Duplexing Tips and Tricks,'' which is recommended reading
for all system managers--even for you 4.1 people.

   Q. To move on to a different subject, Sanjay Jain, of Cambridge, Mass.,
E-mailed this question: ``When I type DISPLAY SERVERS at my file-server
console, it displays my server name with a hop count of 0. Sometimes I can
also find the server listed with a hop count of 1. What's going on? What
are hops, and what do they measure?''

   A. No, your server isn't having a psychotic break, Sanjay. The hop count
shown in the DISPLAY SERVERS output tells you how many IPX routers a packet
would have to go through to get to each listed server. If a packet starts
out at your server and simply returns to the server, it doesn't have to
traverse any routers--thus the hop listing of 0. If your server shows a hop
count of 1 on the same screen, this indicates that the server is hosting a
service that advertises itself via the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP),
such as a print server. If a packet is already in your server and needs to
get to that service, it has to traverse the virtual LAN segment (actually
your server's bus) inside the server to get to there. The virtual LAN
segment inside the server is identified by the Internal IPX network number
in your server's AUTOEXEC.NCF file.
   OK, Novell, here's another plug for the Application Notes: The October
1995 issue (part number 164-000047-010) includes an article titled ``Using
TRACK and Other Console Utilities in a Mixed NetWare Environment.'' This
document has a lot of useful information on hops and DISPLAY SERVERS and
how to use these tools to see what is going on on your network.
   By the way, the NetWare Application Notes are published monthly, and
although they aren't cheap ($95 per year or $135 outside the United
States), they contain lots of good information and should be on any serious
system manager's bookshelf. You can get more information from Novell at
(303) 297-2725 or (800) 377-4136.

   Q. Finally, I received this note from Irving Weiss, a LAN administrator
at Touro College in New York: ``Our backup NetWare 4.1 server's SYS: volume
ran out of space and now refuses to mount. I could delete some files to
make room if only I could get the volume mounted. Do you have any ideas?''

   A. NetWare 4.1 gets really cranky when the SYS: volume fills up. The NDS
(NetWare Directory Services) database information is stored on SYS:, and
DS.NLM requires some free disk space to do that voodoo that it does so
well. Because everything in 4.1 has some connection to NDS, the server will
do the electronic equivalent of assuming a fetal position and whimpering if
SYS: has no space.
   Fortunately, there is a pretty simple solution to this problem. Grab an
extra disk drive, install it in the server, bring the server up with the
-ns option (don't try to execute STARTUP.NCF and AUTOEXEC.NCF), load the
disk driver and INSTALL.NLM from the DOS partition, and add the new drive's
space to the SYS: volume. Then, down the server and bring it back up. You
should now be able to delete some files.
   When you want to remove that extra disk, you'll need to back up
everything on SYS:, destroy SYS:, and restore the data. I'd suggest making
a New Year's resolution to take a look at your disk configuration, Irving.
We at NETLAN recommend that 4.1 servers be configured with a SYS: volume
and at least one volume for user data and programs. We also recommend that
the two should be kept separate to avoid these types of problems.

   Well, another year of LAN Answers has gotten off to an active start. And
if the new year brings new problems to your LAN, drop me a fax or an
E-mail. n

LIEBING ON NETWARE: TIME-SAVING TIPS ASSIST USERS
Using server console commands in NetWare 3.x and NetWare 4.x

By:
Edward Liebing

   'Tis the start of a new year, and I'd like to first thank you for all of
the phone and E-mail messages. For the new year, I'd like to start on a new
topic--the server console commands for Novell Inc. NetWare 3.x and 4.x.
I'll keep you posted on upcoming changes in Client32.
   If you're like me, it's hard to instantly recall all of the commands you
can perform at the server console, especially if you don't use them very
often. Although most people know the simple, everyday commands such as CLS,
CONFIG, and DISPLAY SERVERS, there are more that are very useful. This
article will show you the console commands for both NetWare 3.x and 4.x.
I'll end the column with a tip on console shortcuts--creating .NCF batch
files.

NetWare 4.x's HELP Screen
   With NetWare 4.x, using the console commands has become more accessible;
you can type HELP `Enter' at the console prompt and see a list of all of
the console commands you can perform at the server. The only console
commands listed here that don't apply to NetWare 3.12 are Language, Restart
Server, and Help.
   In NetWare 4.x, you can also type HELP followed by a particular command
to see information that is specific to that command. For example, if you
wanted to see the syntax of a command such as BIND, you would type HELP
BIND `Enter' at the server console prompt. You would see a message similar
to the following on the server screen:

OFFICE: help bind
BIND protocol [to] LAN-
Driverboardme [driverrame-
ter...]
[protocolrameter...]

   This links a specific network board to a communications protocol.
Packets received by a LAN adapter will be discarded unless it has been
bound to a protocol.
   The LAN driver and protocol stack modules must be loaded before this
command can be used. For example:

BIND ipx to ne3200 [slot=3,frame=Ethernet] net=12345678

   As a reference point to begin looking at the console commands, the chart
on this page contains a list of the commands for both NetWare 3.x and
NetWare 4.x. Those that are marked as NetWare 3.x have only been tested on
NetWare 3.12; I gave up my 3.11 server a while back. I will discuss these
console commands one by one in future articles.
   One of the stroke-saver tips that I've used over the years has been to
create .NCF files that I use just like DOS batch files. The differences are
the extension name (.NCF instead of .BAT) and that these batch files are
run at the server console prompt. And it works the same for both NetWare
3.x and NetWare 4.x OSes.
   Batch files are great because they let you forget all the sticky
parameters you most likely have to go and look up anyway. Let's say you are
running NetWare 3.x, and you want to include a -P parameter when you want
to load the MON-
ITOR utility to show the Processor
Utilization option. To do this, go into the SYS:SYSTEM directory and create
an M.NCF file with the following command:

LOAD MONITOR -P

   Once saved, all you have to do is type M `Enter' at the server console
prompt, and the Monitor utility with the Processor
Utilization option enabled will appear. You don't have to include -P for
NetWare 4.x because the Processor Utilization option appears
automatically.
   An example for NetWare 4.x is using the /D option when loading the
SERVMAN utility. The !H parameter displays all kinds of diagnostic SET
parameters in the Server parameter option. So in this case, you would go
into the SYS:SYSTEM directory and create an S.NCF file with the following
command:

LOAD SERVMAN !H

   Then any time you need to use the diagnostic SET parameters, you would
type S `Enter' at the server console prompt. You can also use this method
to create large batch files for loading and unloading AppleTalk drivers,
CD-ROM software, VREPAIR on NetWare 3.x servers, and so on.
   The keys to creating batch files are to remember where you put the .NCF
files and watch your filenames. The easiest place to put the .NCF files is
in the SYS:SYSTEM directory because NetWare always searches that directory
for .NCF files. You can, however, specify other search directories as
well.
   For example, if you wanted to create a local directory, such as
C:\NCFFILES, you can add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.NCF file:

SEARCH ADD 2
C:\NCFFILES

A Batch of Help
   With this searching capability in place, when you type in a command at
the server console prompt, NetWare will first search SYS:SYSTEM to execute
the command and then go to the other directories marked as searchable. Just
be sure not to turn off access to DOS if you do this.
   You must also remember to watch how you name your batch files. For
instance, don't name batch files after console commands, such as UNLOAD.NCF
or BIND.NCF. This can cause confusion, and your batch files may not work.
   Next time, I'll explore console commands and see if I can turn up good
information with a tip or two along the way.

NETWORK MANAGER FINDS EASY FIX FOR THE LITTLE TAPE THAT COULDN'T

By:
Rick Ingersoll

   I came in Friday night to do our network backup. I went through the
usual procedures: Remove old tape, place a new one in the tape drive, run
the backup program, then wait for it to complete.
   After about 10 minutes I checked to see that all was well when I noticed
the backup software had not changed to the normal screen for running the
backup. It seemed to have simply stopped running.
   I downed our three servers and the workstation running the backup
software and then rebooted them. There was no change in the symptoms.
Thinking that perhaps some file or files in the backup software had become
corrupted, I deleted and reinstalled the system. No difference.
   I returned to work on Saturday, read the documentation, and then called
the software maker's technical support. They suggested upgrading the
IPX/NETX to IPXODI/NETX on the workstation running the backup software. I
downloaded the current files from Novell Inc. and did the upgrade. Still no
difference.
   I ran a tape cleaner through the tape drive, and it ran fine. Then I
realized that when I put the backup tape in the tape drive and closed the
drive door, something didn't sound quite right. I pulled the tape out and
looked at it. It looked OK at first, but on closer inspection--looking
under the tape label--the tape had jumped off one of the spools and was not
able to turn properly.
   The tape drive was not sending a tape-ready signal to the backup
software because of the messed-up tape.
   My fix was simple: remove the labels from the other backup tapes and not
put labels over the tape area of the tape spools. This allows inspection of
the tapes for problems before I start the backup.

EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER: VIRTUAL REALITY-BASED LESSONS

By:
Thomas Kaneshige

   Organizations find that trainees retain more material when the teaching
environment is in virtual reality and not in a traditional classroom. And
although one might expect virtual reality (VR) applications to be in the
unreachable realm of a multimillion-dollar flight simulator, today's
low-end VR software costs less than you might think. Plus, it is designed
to run on standard desktop PCs.
   Among those pioneering the effort are Motorola Inc. and Northern Telecom
Inc., which have traditionally invested heavily in classrooms and training
centers. The companies have recently begun migrating to desktop VR software
that simulates hands-on work experience. For instance, the computer screen
might show a 3-D schematic of a control station, piece of equipment, or
overview of a manufacturing line. Students would then interact with the
virtual objects while hearing the same sounds they would hear on real
equipment.
   Motorola and Northern Telecom found that their low-end VR training
software not only is cheaper and easier to deploy for geographically
dispersed students but, in general, also yields better results. Motorola
tested VR in 1994 before implementing a pilot program. The test compared a
sample of people trained with VR with those trained in the classroom. The
results showed VR students outperformed the others once they were placed on
the job.
   Nina Adams, president of Adams Consulting Group in Western Springs,
Ill., and an observer of Motorola's first-year pilot program, said the
program illustrates the excitement VR can generate in people. ``What is
significant is that [after VR training] we took people into the room with
real manufacturing equipment and they were able to perform,'' said Adams.
   Another advantage is the capability to portray working scenarios that
may not currently exist or to simulate critical experiences without
real-life risks.
   A customized VR training tool can be designed, produced, and implemented
within four to six months--less if the customers know from the outset
exactly what they want. And the software does not require special graphics
boards or accelerator cards. Companies opting for VR training tools can
also eliminate costs such as air fare, hotel accommodations, and
instructors' fees--not to mention the cost of maintaining a training
facility.
   ``Northern Telecom's findings show an average savings to customers of
$3,800 per student per course,'' said Roger Frampton, director of worldwide
communications for Superscape Inc., a vendor of VR software in Palo Alto,
Calif. ``VR applications can run on all sorts of desktops or tower or
notebook PCs. That means even if you buy a standard PC to run the software,
the hardware is yours to keep.''
   But the high cost of VR--a customized VR application runs anywhere from
$50,000 to $100,000--still makes it a big-budget commodity. Most of
Superscape's customers are Fortune 500 companies. Analysts and users,
though, agree that VR training software is teetering on the edge of mass
availability.
   According to Darrell Ferris, Northern Telecom's senior manager of VR
applications design, the migration of VR training tools from flight
simulators to the desktop opens up a whole new arena. ``Right now our
question is, What would be the virtual-reality applications? Look at Home
Depot--instead of having weekend workshops or selling books, why not sell a
customer a piece of VR training software? Why not put that stuff on the
Internet? My team thinks the thing is going to explode. You just need to
map it out.''

GETTING AHEAD BY PLAYING ON THE JOB

By:
David Loysen

   When the small defense contractor I was working for won a bid to install
a 220-node Novell Inc. NetWare LAN for the U.S. Army, I quickly grabbed
control. The chance to set up a whole network with no legacy data or user
expectations was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
   I was able to design almost everything the way I knew it should be done.
We bought all of the hardware, rented a warehouse, and set up the network.
After extensive testing with the Army's computer guys, we packed up the
completed network and loaded it into a moving van.
   One week later five other people and I were onsite, ready to set up the
network. There were 22 rooms on two floors; each room would get 10
workstations. One additional office would serve as the wiring closet and
server room.
   All this was in a 1940s concrete-walled building. Because I knew it was
going to be difficult to install the network cabling, I decided to put a
12-port hub in each room. This way I could minimize the number of long
cable pulls. All the network cable was going above the dropped ceiling and
then down the walls. It would be messy but fast to install--or so I
thought.
   The space above the ceiling was a jungle of 50 years worth of electrical
wiring, plumbing, and wire used to hold the suspended ceiling. We spent a
whole day on just two rooms. At that rate, we would be throwing cable for
the next two weeks.
   That night we all met in a bar to try to figure out how we were going to
speed things up. Despite our $150 bar tab, nobody had come up with a viable
solution to our cabling woes.
   The next day, while driving onto the base, we were stopped as a caravan
of jeeps and four-wheel-drive trucks crossed the road in front of us. This
sparked an idea.
   I dropped everybody off and headed back into town. When I returned with
a toy remote-control tank, two small flashlights, a spool of fishing line,
and a supply of batteries, everybody thought I was nuts. And when I taped
the flashlights to the top of the tank and tied the fishing line to it,
they were sure I had lost it.
   But when I slid aside a ceiling tile and drove the tank 100 feet along
the top of the ceiling tiles to the next room and then pulled a cable
through with the fishing line, they declared me a genius.
   We went through three sets of batteries for our tank and managed to
finish the job early. I'm still not sure which felt better: winning a bonus
for completing the job under deadline or handing my boss an expense report
with a receipt from Toys-R-Us on it. After I explained how well my
impromptu solution worked, he paid without hesitation.

AVALAN DELIVERS 32-BIT VERSION OF REMOTELY POSSIBLE

By:
Brad Edwards

   Remotely Possible/32 from Avalan Technology Inc. is a Microsoft Windows
95 application--the 32 stands for 32-bit--that lets you control remote PCs,
transfer files, and chat with other computers running Remotely Possible.
With it, telecommuters can access network resources at the office,
help-desk staff and network administrators can solve problems remotely, and
teachers can share computers with their students.
   Remotely Possible/32 works with its 16-bit counterpart, letting a
Windows 95 computer control both Windows 95 and Windows 3.x machines. In
the 16-bit version, however, modem, LAN, and TCP/IP protocols were sold
separately. Remotely Possible/32 will eventually include support for
modems, IPX, NetBIOS, NetBEUI, and TCP/IP in one package. TCP/IP and modem
support is currently offered, and Avalan will ship the LAN protocols to
early adopters when LAN support is available (scheduled for this month).
   The company has also added several features to this version of Remotely
Possible, including the capability to control multiple machines from one
machine or control one machine from multiple machines. The product also
lets you control another machine, transfer files, and chat simultaneously.

Pretty Safe
   Like most remote-control programs, security is a very real concern with
Remotely Possible/32. Basic security measures include a defineable access
list of users and passwords for each computer. In addition, you can enable
and disable specific features for each user, letting someone send files but
not receive them, for instance.
   Remotely Possible/32 also includes a call-back feature, which can
greatly improve network security. After receiving a correct login name and
password, the computer being accessed ``calls back'' the network address.
This requires that the remote user be connecting from a specific computer.
   Unfortunately, a few security features are missing. For one, Remotely
Possible/32 can't combine its access list with the one you can create in
Windows 95 for sharing files and printers, and maintaining two lists is a
hassle. And although information transmitted between PCs is compressed, it
isn't encrypted. A snoop with a packet sniffer could eavesdrop on chat
sessions and file transfers.

Visual Tics
   Remotely Possible/32 comes on a single floppy disk and loads via a
Windows 95 setup program; installation doesn't get much easier than this.
During setup, you must provide a unique license number for each machine you
are installing Remotely Possible on. Thus, you will need a minimum of two
licenses, one for each side of a connection. After installation, you will
want to configure protocol and security options. The program is very
intuitive, and accomplishing this is easy. In fact, Avalan has done a nice
job with all aspects of the user interface.
   When you're ready to use Remotely Possible, it scans the network for
available hosts and lists the ones it finds. To connect, you simply click
on the appropriate host and supply a username and password. From the menu,
you can select remote-control, chat, or file-transfer options.

Taking Control
   Controlling a remote machine is as easy as controlling your own. By
default, the remote screen appears full-screen on your desktop, but you can
also view it as a separate, smaller window. The file-transfer function now
supports drag and drop and long filenames. If you want to transfer a file
from your desktop to a remote machine, you simply drag it to the
file-transfer window. It would be even better, how-
ever, if you could drag a file directly to the remote desktop.
   We ran into a few display problems with Remotely Possible. Once, the
font in a remote DOS window suddenly became larger, causing words to
overlap. And screens weren't always repainted correctly. Fortunately, we
found these problems insignificant and expect many, if not all, of them to
be fixed by the time the LAN protocols are included.

Save a Tree
   Avalan's online help is terrific. Many entries include a screen shot
from the program. Also, you can check the function of items and windows by
just clicking on them. In fact, online help is so good that you may not
need a printed manual. That's fortunate because Avalan doesn't include
printed documentation unless you specifically request it; the company will
provide it at no charge. We applaud their effort to help the environment.
   Remotely Possible/32 is a great program if you need to connect to and
control remote Windows 95 PCs. To many people, Remotely Possible/32 will
prove invaluable. However, if you're looking for a way just to share files,
first check out the built-in networking capabilities that Windows 95
offers. n

REMOTELY POSSIBLE/32
   Avalan Technology's Remotely Possible/32 offers remote-control,
file-transfer, and chat capabilities for both Windows 95 and Windows 3.x
machines. With the remote-control option, you can control many computers
from one PC or one computer from many PCs. Remotely Possible will be of
most use to telecommuters, help-desk personnel, network administrators,
instructors, and anyone who needs remote access.

XIRCOM OPENS THE DOORS
Netaccess proves network access was never easier

By:
M. Harry Johnson

   With the increasing number of telecommuters and mobile users, LAN
administrators face a growing challenge in providing high-performance
remote-access links. Here to help, Xircom Inc.'s Netaccess Multiport Modem
Card is scaleable, stable, and cost-effective. Netaccess comes with either
four or eight internal modems on a single full-length ISA expansion card,
allowing it to work with both older, slower servers and new, high-end
ones.
   The Netaccess card works with remote-access software so mobile users can
dial in as additional nodes on the network. Although access is slower than
a direct link to the network, the 28.8Kbps transfer rate and V.42 data
compression provide surprisingly satisfactory performance. Because multiple
connections on the single board are tied directly to the bus, Netaccess
does not experience performance losses caused by routing data through
serial-port bottlenecks.
   And because the modems are already on the card, users need only phone
lines and RJ-11 cables, eliminating the cost and potential problems of
external modems and cabling. If additional connections are desired, up to
eight Netaccess cards can be used in the same system, providing up to 64
access ports.

Flip a Switch
   Installation of Netaccess is about as simple as it gets. After selecting
a mode of operation on the basis of the software to be used, you simply
turn a thumb-wheel switch to set port configuration and I/O addresses.
   Xircom provides drivers for Asynchronous I/O (AIO) and NDIS (network
driver interface specification) WAN applications and can also be configured
to operate in COM mode. AIO-compatible applications include Novell Inc.'s
NetWare Connect and FUNK Software Inc.'s WanderLink; NDIS WAN programs
include Microsoft Remote Access Service. Both the AIO and NDIS-WAN drivers
use Xircom's proprietary Xircom Mobile API (XMAPI) architecture to increase
data throughput and decrease server overhead by bypassing the system's
serial ports.
   A single four-port Netaccess board supports COM ports 1 through 4 or 5
through 8. When multiple boards are used, up to 64 COM ports can be
simulated on a single system. COM-port mode supports programs such as Lotus
Notes, Symantec Inc. Norton pcANYWHERE Access Server, and Citrix Systems
Inc. WinView for Networks.
   In addition to its applications support, Netaccess supports all standard
asynchronous protocols. To minimize transmission errors, the Netaccess card
uses V.42 and Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) Class 2 through 4
error-correction methods. The card is capable of achieving data-compression
ratios of up to 4-to-1 by its use of V.42bis and MNP5 compression.
   Netaccess also includes good management tools. The AIO driver contains
an SNMP MIB (Management Information Base) structure to facilitate network
management of the device. Over 20 board parameters and 17 port parameters
can be reported by accessing the MIB structure via a NetWare SNMP agent.
Network-management workstations running applications such as
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s HP OpenView or Novell's NMS (NetWare Management
System) can also access the MIB, allowing the monitoring and control of
Netaccess cards in systems attached to the network.
   On the downside, although access to the LAN is limited only by the
applications accessing Netaccess ports, phone communications are restricted
by the board. Analog transmissions are supported, but digital phone links
and PBX systems are not.
   We tested the four-port Netaccess on a NetWare 4.1 server running
NetWare Connect Services 2.0. On both our test machines, one with a 33MHz
Intel Corp. 486 and the other with a 90MHz Intel Pentium processor, error
correction and performance were consistent. After configuring the board and
copying the necessary driver to the server, we set up the system to load
the Xircom drivers on bootup. The company recommends loading NetWare
Connect after the Xircom driver, and in our testing we found this was
necessary for proper operation, not just preferable.
   After configuration, Netaccess ran very smoothly. Dialing in with the
NetWare remote clients, we experienced stable performance and consistently
high throughput, even when all four ports were being used simultaneously.
   Although we experienced no problems, Xircom does provide help in case of
trouble, including a DOS diagnostic utility called MTERM and the necessary
cables. To trouble shoot, you simply connect the loop-back cables to the
RJ-11 ports, load MTERM, and follow screen instructions.
   If you still have problems, Netaccess' documentation is thorough. It
includes complete installation instructions and reference guides for both
Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc.-compatible AT commands and S-register
commands. Technical support is available via the Internet.
   If you are looking for a cost-effective solution to handle a growing
number of mobile users, Netaccess may be just what you need. It works with
AIO, NDIS-WAN, and COM-port remote-access software, delivering stable,
high-performance modem connections.

435 employees.

NETACCESS MULTIPORT MODEM CARD
   Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card provides mobile users with the
connectivity they need--without breaking your remote-access budget.
Netaccess is fully compatible with third-party software such as Novell
NetWare Connect, Microsoft Remote Access Service, and Symantec Norton
pcANYWHERE Access Server. Netaccess can reliably handle up to 64 users
without bogging down--value that is well worth the price.

TWO COMBO CARDS JOIN THE RACE
Xircom, ActionTec Electronics deliver 28.8Kbps Ethernet/modem PC Cards

By:
John L. Payton

   Two more combination Ethernet/modem PC Card adapters have joined the
high-speed connectivity race: ActionTec Electronics Inc.'s ComNet 28.8 and
Xircom Inc.'s CreditCard Ethernet+Modem 28.8. The companies come to the
playing field with significantly different backgrounds. ActionTec,
previously known as PreMax Electronics Inc., boasts one of the broadest PC
Card lines on the market, whereas Xircom has focused mainly on network
communications.

ActionTec ComNet
   Your users will find it easy to install the ComNet card, mainly because
the DOS-based setup severely limits available options. Only Novell Inc.
NetWare and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups network drivers are included,
and the program offers only two IRQs (interrupt request lines) for Ethernet
operation: 15 and 10. If the modem portion is configured for COM2, only IRQ
3 can be used. If COM3 or COM4 is chosen, the IRQ selection broadens, but
it remains restricted to a value less than the one chosen for the network.
COM1 is entirely unavailable.
   After our installation, the network driver refused to load at all if any
interrupt other than the two ActionTec recommends was selected. In fact,
one of the recommended values allowed the driver to load but would not
activate the Ethernet adapter.
   The manual was of little help. Although it is a satisfactory reference
for modem use and commands, it offers little trouble-shooting information.
The Ethernet portion seems like an afterthought, even though it is located
at the beginning of the book. Technical support was much more helpful in
configuring the card, although they did seem inexperienced with advanced
issues.
   After finding a working network-adapter configuration through a process
of trial and error, we loaded the required Card and Socket Services--no
point enabler was available--and the network drivers. This left memory
available for programs distressingly low, although we could run Windows and
a single program. Our Ethernet communications were smooth, and ComNet
supports Novell's LANalyzer for Windows. The card's physical connection is
the only drawback in this area: ComNet provides an RJ-45 intended to
replace the patch cord.
   The modem portion of the card fared about as well. We had to fight to
make the card work but couldn't argue with performance. Simultaneous
Ethernet/modem operation worked as well as standalone and was actually
easier to configure because the manual's instructions for using the
modem-only enabler are completely inaccurate. And although the manual
claims that cellular capability is available, ActionTec's technical support
staff told us this isn't so--another strike against the documentation.
   ComNet's software bundle is impressive. The package includes Traveling
Software Inc.'s LapLink for Windows, Starfish Software Inc.'s Sidekick
personal organizer, McAfee Associates Inc.'s VirusScan, and CompuServe
Inc.'s Spry Mosaic browser, as well as access software for CompuServe,
America Online, and GENIE. Strangely, no basic communications or fax
software is included.

Xircom CreditCard
   Xircom's CreditCard Ethernet+Modem (CEM) 28.8 has evolved nicely from
the CEM II we reviewed in a comparison last spring (see ``PCMCIA
Ethernet/Modem Cards,'' April 24, 1995, Page 101). Its sophistication is
evident from the moment the installation program auto-detects and loads
Windows. The installation software is also extremely flexible, letting you
customize nearly every aspect of the card. We achieved a working
configuration on our first try. The Ethernet and modem portions operated
well--both independently and simultaneously--even without the help of Card
and Socket Services.
   Xircom technical support told us that, like the CEM II, the CEM 28.8
will not work with LANalyzer. As it turns out, this is not the case at all.
As long as you load the RXMONSTK.COM driver before the Multi-Link Interface
Driver, LANalyzer runs quite well, omitting only runt packets from our
analysis. We had mixed feelings about the situation. We were glad the CEM
28.8 was compatible with LANalyzer, but we worried that technical support
might be offering incorrect information in other areas as well.
   The CEM 28.8 has a separate module for 10Base-2 connections, increasing
its connection flexibility, and administrators will appreciate the card's
SNMP manageability. Unfortunately, a cellular module is not available,
although Xircom is redesigning the card to work with its standard cellular
kit. The company says it will offer an inexpensive swapout when the
redesign is complete.
   The manual, which we barely needed, is well-organized, with equal weight
given to both Ethernet and modem functions. The separate trouble-shooting
guide includes tips for a large number of configurations, evidence of the
testing Xircom has put the card through under different environments. The
CEM 28.8 comes bundled with Delrina Corp.'s WinFax Lite and WinComm Lite,
as well as Shiva Corp.'s ShivaPPP client software.
   You probably won't be surprised to hear that we strongly favored the CEM
28.8. There are some similarities between the products: Both companies
offer support via voice, fax, and BBS; both advertise cellular capability
that does not yet exist; and both achieved about the same performance in
our testing. However, ComNet's requirement of Card and Socket Services
depletes resources that could be put to better use, and CEM 28.8's setup
and documentation were clearly superior.

The CreditCard Ethernet+Modem 28.8 reflects Xircom's networking experience
and high standards. Setup is flexible, and we were able to make a
connection on our first try. Although technical support told us the CEM
28.8 wouldn't work with LANalyzer, we found that it would. All in all, this
one's a keeper.

ActionTec seems to have spent more time developing the modem portion of
this PC Card; Ethernet access appears thrown in as an afterthought.

possesses a lot of potential but needs a better user interface. Give this
one time to grow.

NETSHIELD VS. NET-PROT
Two stellar products offer virus protection for your network

By:
Tom Springer

   Approximately 100 new computer viruses appear each month, adding to the
6,000 known viruses currently in existence. Network file servers are
especially susceptible to infection, and experts agree that virus
prevention is much easier than virus removal. Both NET-PROT from Command
Software Systems Inc. and NetShield 2.2 from McAfee Associates Inc. are
effective virus-detection programs that, when used with the companies'
disinfection tools, can help keep your system free of uninvited guests.

The Match Game
   Although NET-PROT and NetShield each use proprietary virus-scanning
technology, the basic functionality of the two products is the same. Both
perform on-demand, on-access, and periodic scanning of network traffic to
prevent viruses from loading. NET-PROT, however, can only perform periodic
scans weekly; NetShield offers daily, weekly, or monthly scans. For added
flexibility, both tools let you specify certain files and volumes for
exclusion from a scan, although only NetShield will let you exclude
directories.
   If a scan detects an infected file, both NET-PROT and NetShield can
delete the file or move it to a specific location. To disinfect a virus,
however, you must run workstation versions of the server software.
NET-PROT's version, F-PROT PROFESSIONAL, is included with the product, but
NetShield's offering, VirusScan, must be purchased separately.
   NetShield's management console integrates very well with
VirusScan-convenient when you want to immediately disinfect a file after
virus detection. NET-PROT, on the other hand, requires you to exit the
operator's console and run F-PROT PROFESSIONAL from DOS.
   Each product uses its own scheme to maintain network performance during
a scan. NET-PROT uses configureable utilization levels; you set scans to
occur only when CPU utilization falls below a certain value. This method
ensures that a periodic scan will not run when the network is busy.
NetShield uses a priority scheme, with a highest priority of one and a
lowest of 10. McAfee claims that a priority one periodic scan is about 10
times faster than a priority 10 scan.

Caught Them All
   Both products could detect all our test viruses, but NetShield took much
longer to do so. NET-PROT scanned a 500MB volume in just over two minutes,
but a priority one NetShield scan of the same volume took almost six
minutes.
   NetShield beats NET-PROT regarding administrator notification. Both
products can broadcast a network message to specified users when a scan
detects a virus, but only NetShield offers E-mail and pager notification.
Unless you constantly check NET-PROT's log file, you may be unaware a virus
has infected your system, giving it more time to spread.
   NET-PROT and NetShield offer basic password-protection capabilities and
optional security features. For example, NET-PROT can automatically log off
any user who tries to copy an infected file to the network, and NetShield
can restrict write access to certain files, directories, or users. Overall
though, we found that NetShield provides a little more flexibility for
those networks that need extra security.
   And although both companies claim their products can detect previously
unknown viruses, some new viruses always go undetected, and McAfee and
Command Software continually update their lists of known viruses. With a
site license you can download the latest updates from Command Software's
list without charge; McAfee, on the other hand, requires a two-year
maintenance fee.

What It Takes
   NET-PROT and NetShield use a Microsoft Windows-based management console,
and NET-PROT includes a DOS version if you don't prefer a GUI. Neither
product supports Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh or IBM OS/2 systems.
   NET-PROT requires a file server with 85K of free RAM running Novell Inc.
NetWare 3.x or 4.x. The management console only requires DOS 2.0 or
higher.
   NetShield requires a NetWare 3.x or 4.x file server with 718K of free
RAM and 18MB of free disk space. The operator's console requires at least a
386SX, 4MB of RAM, a VGA monitor, DOS 5.0 or higher, and Windows 3.1. If
you are running NetWare 3.11 or 3.12, you will also need several NLM
patches. They are included on the CD-ROM release and are available for
download. The NetShield client works with either Windows 3.1 or Windows
95.
   Despite NetShield's slower speed, we really had no complaints about
either product's performance. Note, however, that NET-PROT requires
significantly fewer system resources than NetShield.
   We were up and running with NET-PROT in about five minutes; NetShield's
installation, on the other hand, was much more difficult. We discovered
that if the attributes for AIO.NLM and AIOCOMX.NLM are set to read-only,
the installation program--after it is 97 percent completed--will notify you
that the target directory is read-only and you should check to see if you
have the appropriate rights. This message can be confusing, especially if
you are running the installation from a supervisor account with complete
privileges. To finish the installation, you must change the attributes of
the two NLM files.
   Also, NetShield uses search path 1 to point to the system directory. If
another module previously defined search path 1, NetShield will not load.
We think the program should be smart enough to use the next available
search path.
   Although NetShield is more powerful and has more features than NET-PROT,
it is also slower and considerably more expensive. Generally, we prefer
NET-PROT for single-server systems and NetShield for multiserver
environments. How-
ever, you won't go wrong with either; both provide excellent ways to keep a
network free of viruses.

NET-PROT
   Compared with McAfee's NetShield, Command Software's NET-PROT lacks some

requires fewer system resources, and runs faster than NetShield. For a
simple, single-server environment, NET-PROT is a good choice.

MICRO LOGIC INFO SELECT IS A PIM FOR EVERYONE

By:
Thom Duncan

   If you believe the hype, groupware applications suites are the wave of
the future--along with the increased RAM and hard disk requirements they
will entail. Supposedly, the days of the small single-purpose program are
over. Don't believe it. One of the best information-management utilities
we've seen came to us on a single floppy disk and runs well on an Intel
Corp. 386-based machine with Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 4MB of RAM.
   We speak of Micro Logic Corp.'s Info Select 3, a note-taker, planner,
and PIM (personal information manager) fused into a single package. That
description isn't an exaggeration; Info Select really is all those
things--and more. Even better, Info Select's interface is just as
versatile.
   Info Select's opening window is a split screen, with a treelike
directory called the Selector on the left and a work space on the right.
The Selector contains different data types--Notes, Topics, Forms, and
Calendars--each of which is indicated by its own icon. Other icons in the
Selector indicate that a particular item in the database has an associated
file, is read-only, has a user-imposed search barrier, or is a template
that can be used for the creation of new items.
   Notes are used for free-form text documents; if you suddenly get an idea
for a new project, you can just press `Alt-Tab' to access Info Select and
start typing. Notes' word-processing features are basic but adequate,
including simple page-layout options. If you're organized, you can place
Notes into categories. Topics act like folders, classifying data into
headings and subheadings. You can use the flexible Forms feature to take
phone messages, prepare purchase orders, conduct surveys, manage invoices,
or organize any type of field-oriented information. Design tools for Forms
are also basic but functional. With Calendars, you can schedule
appointments, one-time events, recurring events, ticklers, and so on.
   For such a simple program, Info Select contains fairly sophisticated
search capabilities, and we searched our sample database at very acceptable
speeds. Search tools include exact, neural (fuzzy), Boolean, size,
data-range, and change-date searches.
   Info Select's interface includes a tool bar, a folder bar, and a status
bar. The tool bar provides a quick way to perform common tasks--pulling up
a Calendar, for instance--and it can be customized or hidden from view. The
folder bar provides shortcuts for formatting font style, size, and color.

Stripped Down
   Info Select's network capabilities stay true to the lean, mean design of
the rest of the product. Co-workers can share name and address databases,
keep group to-do lists, and distribute just about any kind of information
to other Info Select users. Although multiple users can view shared files,
only one user can edit a shared file at a time.
   Installing Info Select on a network is fairly straightforward. In
addition to its built-in data-sharing capabilities, the program can hook
into your E-mail system, letting you send and receive Info Select data.
After installing Info Select on a server, you must create a subdirectory on
a shared drive; Info Select files that contain shared data are placed in
this directory.
   For a workstation to be able to use the data-sharing capabilities, it
must be manually configured. After installing Info Select on the
workstation, you run the network-installation program, which asks for the
path to the shared directories.
   Info Select is an information manager designed to yield maximum utility
to those with minimum experience. Users won't have to learn complex
data-entry procedures, nor will they be forced to upgrade older PCs to take
advantage of Info Select's excellent features. This isn't a full-fledged
groupware application, but if your users need to share basic data, this
could be a fairly painless way to achieve it.

Screen: Info Select's interface is easy to use, but it can be configured
for any taste. Here, a tool bar is being customized.

                 INFO SELECT
This one-floppy-disk wonder gives network users an amazing amount of
functionality. Users can enter notes in a free-form manner or in structured
manner on the basis of personal preference. Info Select searches and finds
data in acceptable times without indexing and, thus, without adding to hard
disk space.

MULTISTACK MORE THAN SUM OF PARTS
Digital's component collection combines existing network technology in
better way

By:
Tere' Parnell

   At first glance, there's nothing breathtaking about Digital Equipment
Corp.'s MultiStack System, the recently announced manifestation of the
company's enVISN strategy. The hub, switch, and router technology that
makes up the MultiStack System has been around for a while. But although
the MultiStack doesn't offer any original functionality, it does deliver
the management paradigm that administrators of small- to medium-sized
networks have been waiting for.

What We Waited for
   The MultiStack System is a hot-swappable collection of internetworking
components that includes Digital's 90 series repeaters, the RoamAbout
wireless network hub, and the NetRider remote-access hub. The excitement
about the MultiStack System is that it can be managed as a single SNMP
management domain using HUBWatch, Digital's management software. By
providing for stacks of key components up to 16 hubs high, Digital finally
delivers the flexibility and management network administrators have always
needed. What's more, all this is available at a realistic price. For
example, 10Base-T hubs cost as little as $50 per port.
   Because of its extreme manageability, remote-access capability, and
compact size, the MultiStack System is especially well-suited for
branch-office networks. Initially, you can stack the components on a table
top in the branch office. Later, as the office grows, you can mount the
MultiStack components in a standard 19-inch rack. You can distribute
MultiStack components throughout your network as necessary up to 185 meters
apart, and you can install 90 series hub modules in a DEChub 900
MultiSwitch hub chassis.
   The MultiStack System also integrates with Digital's DECswitch family to
form what Digital calls ``switched edge stacks.'' This provides a fairly
easy and inexpensive way to implement switching in high-traffic segments.

Tough Installation
   We found piecing together the components of the MultiStack System a
challenge. We had to wade through a swamp of documentation--much of it
inadequate--to find the tidbits of information we needed. Configuring
HUBWatch is also an involved and time-consuming process. Allow yourself
plenty of time to get acquainted with this system before expecting to
perform management miracles with it. Still, once configured, MultiStack is
an administrator's paradise--a neat, compact stack manageable as a single
domain.
   To test the MultiStack System's hardiness, we flooded the ports of one
of the hubs until it auto-partitioned and lost its connection to the rest
of the stack. Even then we could see the device on HUBWatch, although we
couldn't manage it. Management for the rest of the stack was unaffected
thanks to MultiStack's use of a separate channel to integrate SNMP
connections. This provides a particularly robust means of managing all
devices in the stack, although sometimes--as in our test--maintaining
contact with a partitioned device isn't much help.
   Digital's MultiStack System, a new paradigm in network management,
delivers internetworking the way it should be. This relatively low-cost
system brings together hubs, switches, remote-access hubs, and wireless
devices into a compact and easy-to-manage stack. Although you've seen
devices like these before, you've never seen them work together quite like
this. They snap together quickly and easily, and once the configuration
headaches are behind you, they manage as a single SNMP domain with
Digital's HUBWatch software. The system is flexible, sturdy, easily
expandable, and cost-effective. Our only question was, what took so long?

DEBATING DESKTOP MANAGEMENT
Group identifies performance, control, and cost as issues hindering tool
deployment

By:
Claudia Graziano

(SAN FRANCISCO)
   Desktop-management tools still have a way to go before securing a place
in corporate America.
   At least that seemed to be the general conclusion drawn by a group of
vendors, analysts, and users assembled here last month to discuss the topic
of desktop management.
   Participants in the round-table discussion--moderated by the Enterprise
Management Institute and sponsored by LAN Times--cited a mislaid emphasis
on completing tasks rather than meeting business objectives as a key reason
for the slow adoption of desktop-management tools.
   Although the purpose of the round table was to take stock of the current
state of desktop management, there was little discussion of the technology
behind the tools themselves. Instead, the discussion centered around more
philosophic topics, such as defining the functions of desktop management
and exploring the relationship between LAN managers and users within an
organization.
   Representatives from top desktop-management software
developers--including Intel Corp., McAfee Associates Inc., and Microsoft
Corp.--agreed that users should be more aware of what it takes to manage
their systems but disagreed on how much awareness was appropriate.
   ``Users hate the fact that they don't see any perceived value in systems
management,'' said David Hamilton, network- and systems-management product
manager at Microsoft. ``They're concerned about the Big Brother issue;
they're concerned about administrators having too much control.''
   But reconciling users' wants and administrators' needs can be a
balancing act.
   ``I think it's scary to give [users] a lot of control,'' said Rick
Kreysar, vice president of marketing at McAfee in Santa Clara, Calif. ``Too
much perceived value and you're going to up your support calls.'' He
suggested that perceived value may be in making management processes that
occur at the desktop invisible to the user.
   Other participants pointed out that restricting users' desktop
activities could cause a similarly negative reaction.
   ``People are looking at ways to minimize the amount of effort it takes
to maintain a certain number of users,'' said Stephen Saks, chief
information officer for California Trucking Association in Sacramento.
``But what sometimes happens is you wind up with more support calls, with
IS individuals fixing problems that don't exist,'' he said.
   Another key point of discussion centered around getting other
departments in an organization involved in desktop management.
   ``It's hard to [justify tools] to the head of the engineering or
manufacturing department. The MIS guy understands the cost benefits [of
desktop-management tools], but the head of the manufacturing department is
the guy who ultimately has to sign off on it, and he may not understand how
that's going to increase his department's productivity,'' said Kreysar.
   ``In a lot of ways desktop management is still an evangelistic market,''
said Ken Mackin, systems-management strategy manager at Intel in Hillsboro,
Ore. ``There is a lack of education about what these tools can do.''
   From a customer standpoint, there is also a great deal of skepticism
about what tools can do, volunteered California Trucking's Saks. ``There
are a lot of [vendor] promises made but very few are kept,'' he said.
``You're going to hear a lot more `I'll believe it when I see it' '' as
tools evolve.
   In many ways, the notion of network management is changing, said analyst
Michael Howard, president of Infonetics Research Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
   ``I predict that in five to seven years we won't even use the term
network management because we're going to get to the point with ATM where
there will be no network monitoring. You'll probably outsource that to your
phone company.'' Instead, business management will become the focus. ``I
would suggest that there is an eighth layer to the OSI [Open Systems
Interconnection] model, and that's the business layer.'' Desktop and
systems management will be inherent in how organizations apply network
resources, he said.
   ``Our job will be done when PCs are managed by the human-resources
department,'' summed up Intel's Mackin.

On defining desktop management:
   ``We believe that you need to make a clear distinction between systems
and network management. Systems-management solutions should function
whether or not the network is there.''--Ken Mackin, systems-management
strategy manager, emerging technologies group, Intel Corp.

   ``I'm afraid of breaking network and systems management up. I think that
we have to turn it around and start looking at business issues like cost of
ownership and work from that perspective, rather than be too careful with
our definition of what the particular areas are.''--David Hamilton,
network- and systems-management product manager, Microsoft Corp.

   ``Desktop management, from my perspective, is how do I provide my end
users with the tools that let them be as productive and creative as
possible? Far too often you end up frustrating the user [with management]
instead of providing them with something that gives them the ability to
perform at a higher level.''--Stephen Saks, chief information officer,
California Trucking Association

On the cost justification of tools:
   ``Network management is easier to [cost] justify than systems management
because network management is about routers and hubs and bridges. These are
things people can understand and care about. I think we're not as
user-focused or as business-oriented as we need to be to sell systems
management.''--David Hamilton, Microsoft

   ``When you go and tell executive officers, `We can reduce our workload
by using this tool,' they're not going to care because it doesn't impact
the bottom line.''--Stephen Saks, California Trucking Association

   ``If you can turn your management products into middleware and deliver
that data to some financial-management package, then all of a sudden you
can make a business case for buying and installing a particular
[management] module or solution.''--Ken Mackin, Intel

   ``Management has to be central; it has to be built into the network from
the ground up. If we assume management is a value add, we're going to have
trouble moving on.''--David Hamilton, Microsoft

On the struggle for control:
   ``Our biggest problems are caused because [network managers] don't have
centralized control, but at the same time, users don't want you to have
centralized control.''--Rick Kreysar, vice president of marketing, McAfee
Associates Inc.

   ``The only effective way to control the desktop is to have an absolutely
clear corporate mission about what you are controlling and why you are
controlling it.''--Michael Howard, president, Infonetics Research Inc.

   ``Too many developers are out there trying to convince the IS people
that they are the important ones--that they make the decisions and that
they will dictate to everyone else.''--Stephen Saks, California Trucking
Association

   ``Desktop management is like outsourcing in that you're really
transferring responsibility of the system to someone else. If you think of
management in terms of outsourcing, it changes what you think you can
[control] and how you try to do it.''--Rick Sturm, principal, Enterprise
Management Institute Inc.

On promoting the use of tools:
   ``When we say we need to provide business solutions instead of
technology solutions, I think what we really mean is that we need to think
about who we're defining solutions for, and we need to recognize that the
financial person in an organization needs to be involved.''--Ken Mackin,
Intel

   ``Networks are becoming a commodity--almost. The people who take care of
commodities are not as sophisticated as the people in the glass house. You
can no longer give somebody a tool and expect them to figure it out, write
their own code and macros and such.''--Rick Kreysar, McAfee

   ``I agree we have to make management [tools] easy for the administrator,
but we also have to convince end users of its value. Whether its helping
them tune their systems, making applications work together, or showing them
that they get better help-desk support.
   ``I'd like users to know [management] is there and see value in it
rather than have to hide it.''--David Hamilton, Microsoft

MICROSOFT TO SPEED UP SNA OVER WIDE AREA

By:
Brian Riggs

   Network administrators are eyeing Microsoft Corp.'s upcoming
architecture for distributed SNA gateways that promises to combat session
loss, excessive bandwidth utilization, and complex management.
   Distributed gateways, made possible when Microsoft integrates the
Distributed Gateway Service into its new SNA Open Gateway Architecture
(SOGA) later this month, are intended to transform SNA Server into a
scaleable framework for transporting and managing SNA traffic among
multiple branch offices.
   The first products to support SOGA include Sourcecom Corp.'s Incarda
server internetworking card and Polaris Communications Inc.'s System 2000
Gateway. Bay Networks Inc., Sync Research Inc., and others are expected to
announce products later in the year.
   SOGA-supporting hardware is expected to let SNA and LAN traffic run over
wide-area connections without excessive timeouts, high bandwidth
requirements, or complicated management techniques.
   SNA network administrators have used recent versions of SNA Server to
connect branch offices to a centralized host via SDLC (Synchronous Data
Link Control) leased lines or the 802.2/Logical Link Control protocol.
Alternately, remote LANs can connect to a central SNA gateway using
standard LAN protocols. But these solutions have led to timeouts and high
bandwidth utilization.
   ``What we need is a way to run IP without having to encapsulate it into
SNA,'' said Mark Lee, systems consultant at the Bank of Hawaii in
Honolulu.
   The Bank of Hawaii currently connects 70 branch offices to its Honolulu
headquarters by running SNA over X.25 lines. Lee, who is planning to use a
Unix server for data warehousing later in the year, has been looking at SNA
Server as a way to send IP over the SNA backbone. ``Microsoft came in and
showed us how we could use [the current version of] SNA Server, but we
found it to be unreliable and slow,'' he said.
   Lee said he is counting on SOGA's upcoming Distributed Gateway Service
to transport both host and server traffic over native TCP/IP.
   Existing approaches to SNA transport have worked well in campus
environments because fiber and 100Mbps Ethernet provides users with plenty
of bandwidth, according to Lynn Nye, president of NetResults, a consultancy
in Portland, Ore.
   But when SNA data from branch offices is transported over the wide area
at the 56Kbps and 1.544Mbps speeds that are typical of WAN services,
response times between host and branch can slow to a crawl, he said.
   Moreover, when using equipment such as 802.2 connectors, SNA transport
is subject to unpredictable delays caused by session loss. And when
transported over the wide area via TCP/IP, client transmissions to
centralized SNA gateway servers can carry as much as 200 percent more
overhead compared with local- and campus-area transmissions.
   SOGA's Distributed Gateway Service, on the other hand, lets
administrators deploy SNA gateways at each branch site. All remote gateways
connect to the host and all traffic between gateways uses native TCP/IP,
IPX, or Banyan Systems Inc. VINES.
   Without the 802.2 connectors, SNA WANs based on SOGA are not expected to
experience session loss. And because SNA is running natively over IP,
traffic will occupy considerably less bandwidth, letting network
administrators use small, less-expensive WAN lines, Nye said.
   From a management perspective, network administrators using SOGA will be
able to pool logical units (LUs) over the wide area. This is expected to
reduce the total number of LUs that need to be managed. With gateways at
each branch site and all gateways connected with TCP/IP, administrators can
extend IBM's NetView management platform over the wide area. ``In the past,
[network managers] could only see central-site gateways with NetView,'' Nye
said.
   But because SOGA's Distributed Gateway Service lets SNA gateways be
distributed to all branch locations, managers will have a complete view of
all gateways on the WAN, he said.

WINGRA E-MAIL SWITCH MAKES MISSIVE ACCESSIBLE

By:
Brent Dorshkind

   Aiming to bring E-mail integration to a wider audience, Wingra
Technologies Inc. has announced Missive/AIX, a software-based switch that
starts at $15,000 and runs on an RS/6000 workstation.
   The switch, which can route and convert E-mail messages among a wide
range of LAN, mainframe, and Internet mail systems, is aimed at customers
who can't afford or don't need the company's VAX-based message switches.
The product is also one of the first E-mail tools to use World Wide
Web-based administration tools.
   Missive/AIX is the first of a series of products that will utilize open
systems and emphasize ease of use. The company plans versions of the
product for Microsoft Windows NT as well as other flavors of Unix.
   ``Wingra has moved from the proprietary world into the enlightened Unix
world,'' said Mark Levitt, senior analyst at International Data Corp., a
market-research company in Framingham, Mass. ``That opens up a much larger
potential customer base.''
   That customer base will get an E-mail switching core that includes a
1988 X.500-compliant directory; an integrated message router; document
conversion software; and IPX, TCP, and Digital Equipment Corp. DECnet
transport-level protocol stacks. Individual E-mail packages are then tied
into the Missive/AIX core via ``channels,'' that average $3,000 a piece.
The $15,000 entry price includes channels for two E-mail systems.
   Wingra is shipping channels for Lotus cc:Mail and Notes Mail, Microsoft
Mail, Novell Inc. GroupWise, and other MHS (Message Handling Service)- and
Global MHS-based E-mail systems such as ON Technology Corp. Da Vinci eMAIL.
Digital VMSmail, Digital Message Router, and E-mail systems based on
SMTP/MIME (Simple Message Transfer Protocol/Multipurpose Internet Message
Extension) channels are also available. A channel for IBM PROFS is
scheduled to ship by April, and X.400 support is due by year-end.
   Missive/AIX administrators can also access the user directory from a Web
browser. This not only simplifies management but also allows remote
administration. Registered users can browse the directory to search for
E-mail addresses and modify a configureable subset of attributes, such as
document conversion profiles, phone numbers, and addresses. Users without
browsers can use E-mail to query the directory for other users' E-mail
addresses.
   Missive/AIX is targeted to threaten message switch products from vendors
such as Control Data Systems Inc. and Lotus Development Corp that often
cost $100,000 more and require extensive customization--often at additional
expense.
   ``I was in the market for something easy,'' said an E-mail administrator
at an East Coast financial services firm, who--citing company
policy--declined to be identified in print. He claimed he was able to bring
Missive/AIX online, fully configured to integrate cc:Mail, Notes Mail, and
Unix SMTP mail systems in only one and a half hours.
   Innosoft International Inc. and Worldtalk Corp also offer low-cost
message switches. However, the real challenge to Missive/AIX could come
from the next-generation of E-mail products, which support SMTP and X.400
natively.
   Even with the deployment of such E-mail packages, Missive/AIX and
products like it will still have a place when companies have multiple
E-mail systems. ``Even those users who have committed to migrating to a
single E-mail system will need time to do that,'' said Levitt. ``Until
that's in place, they will still need products to connect their existing
systems.''

ATTACHMATE TO CONNECT MAINFRAMES TO NET
Acquisition yields Web-based workgroup products for legacy systems

By:
R. Scott Raynovich

   Following its planned acquisition of Internet software specialist The
Wollongong Group Inc., Attachmate Corp. will deliver a series of workgroup
products that let businesses use World Wide Web-based applications to
connect to mainframe systems.
   Products planned for the first quarter include the Emissary Host
Publishing System and Emissary Workgroup. In addition to allowing mainframe
data to be converted into HTML (HyperText Markup Language) format, the
products will also offer E-mail, group conferencing, and Internet browsing
capabilities. The server-side products will be based on Microsoft Windows
NT and the client-side products will be based on Microsoft Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95.
   Industry watchers say Attachmate's approach will permit the integration
of mainframe systems with Web applications, improving connectivity across
internal TCP/IP-based corporate intranets or the Internet.
   ``A lot of people don't want to deal with emulation or other software to
bring the mainframe interface to the desktop,'' said Clay Ryder, analyst
with Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. ``If you can deliver
mainframe data as a Web page, you'll deliver a universal access client.''
When its deal to acquire Wollongong is finalized, Attachmate will get
Emissary, a highly regarded Web browser that also integrates messaging and
file-system functions. Emissary is based on Wollongong's Client Object
Linking Technology (COLT), which links OLE-based objects and applications
through a single interface. Emissary will form the basis of Attachmate's
new browsing interfaces, and Attachmate's OpenMind collaboration software
will be combined with Emissary to further develop its capabilities.
   Attachmate officials said their goal is to offer an architecture that
lets companies use Emissary Workgroup and Emissary Office as the standard
corporate interface for exchanging information.
   Sandy Bateh, assistant computer systems officer for the city of
Jacksonville, Fla., said he may eventually use the Attachmate products to
provide the city's desktops with both mainframe and Internet access.
   Bateh said he has been using Attachmate products for mainframe access
and would like to consolidate Internet browsing with mainframe access. This
would be cheaper than paying licensing fees for both Attachmate's
host-connectivity products and Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator.
   Some analysts say that using COLT to exchange OLE objects over networks
in combination with Attachmate's collaboration technology will make the
Emissary products attractive to IS managers trying to consolidate client
platforms.
   ``Emissary's automatic-update feature and Attachmate's
software-management features are the types of things that will help IS
deploy Internet products,'' said Tim Sloane, director of messaging for The
Aberdeen Group Inc. in Boston. Sloane said vendors such as IBM, Digital
Equipment Corp., and Oracle Corp. have provided tools for integrating
databases into the Web but that the products are limited to their own
proprietary technologies.
   Attachmate's Host Publishing System will come with database tools that
let programmers integrate PC applications with IBM DB2, DB2/400, and
SQL/DS databases. The publishing system itself will enable on-the-fly
conversion of IBM host screens into HTML pages, letting users browse
mainframes just like Web servers.
   Emissary Workgroup will include the Windows NT-based server components
and Windows 95 and 3.1 clients for Internet and file browsing, group
conferencing, and document management.
   Both Emissary Workgroup and the Host Publishing System are expected in
the first quarter. Pricing has not been set.

WANG TO COMBINE IMAGING, HSM TOOL
Avail acquisition to enhance document-image management and workflow
products

By:
Stephen Loudermilk

   Wang Laboratories Inc.'s move to acquire Avail Systems Corp. last month
could put an end to the cumbersome task of storing large document images on
many different enterprise servers.
   In upcoming products due in the first half of next year, Wang plans to
combine storage-management technology gained from Avail with its OPEN/image
and OPEN/workflow server software, company officials said. Furthermore,
this convergence of storage-management and imaging technology resulting
from the merger will expand on existing partnerships that both Wang and
Avail have with Microsoft Corp.
   A front end to Wang's ImageView client piece will be integrated by
Microsoft in the next release of Microsoft Windows 95, code-named Memphis
and due next year, Wang officials said. Separately, Microsoft has already
embedded Avail's NetSpace Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) software in
Windows NT, and it will also be included in Cairo, the forthcoming version
of NT due in 1997.
   From their desktops, users will be able to click on an ImageView icon in
the Memphis version of Windows 95 and launch a full-blown document-imaging
application. Network managers, meanwhile, will be able to view,
manipulate, and archive document images on Windows 95 desktops and then
store the massive-image data types on tightly linked Windows NT servers.
   Billerica, Mass.-based Wang exchanged 1.8 million shares of its common
stock for Avail, valued at $18 per share or approximately $32 million.
Avail will become the Enterprise Storage Division of Wang's software
business unit.
   Robert Wight, president and CEO of Avail in Boulder, Colo., expects the
merged products to simplify the job for users now managing proprietary
hardware dedicated to either imaging or storage-management software.
   ``There is a natural need to integrate [imaging and storage management]
together,'' said Wight. ``We are taking a new step in going away from
proprietary products with [new] products that do imaging, backup, and
storage management on [any] NT server.''
   Gerry Murray, senior analyst with International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass., said that a lack of imaging and storage-management
integration has affected large companies burdened with too many imaging
systems.
   ``This is a real nightmare and obstacle for large organizations,'' said
Murray. ``For large companies with 10,000 employees, there are about five
or six different imaging systems, and there is a frustration in waiting for
the image at the desktop.'' Murray explained that having a variety of 
servers can complicate the task of processing and sending images to Windows
95 clients.
   Bob Abraham, vice president of Freeman Associates in Santa Barbara,
Calif., agreed. ``Now the marriage and the integration can happen. The user
wants an open approach that was previously separate between Wang and
Avail.''
Murray said the convergence of imaging technology with storage-management
systems lets images be stored as just another data type in workgroup
environments.
   ``The storage-level piece of the puzzle links a production-level system
and a workgroup,'' he said.
   NetSpace users expect that the Wang plans for product integration will
improve the performance of document imaging and other applications.
   ``We are using [Avail's] HSM software for CAD drawing,'' said Earl
Huskamp, MIS manager at Professional Engineering Consultants in Wichita,
Kan. ``If Wang adds more storage--such as optical jukeboxes--that would
help me out.''

NOVELL'S ROAD AHEAD
After a tumultuous year, company looks to steady the ship

By:
Amanda Mitchell Henry

   After spending the better part of last year cleaning house, Novell Inc.
is now under pressure to deliver promised technology to skeptical
customers.
   Unburdened by products such as Unix and misfit business applications,
Novell has freed itself this year to persevere in its goal to make NetWare
4.x a de facto networking infrastructure on which a company's core services
run. One key to that strategy is the agreements forged with Hewlett-Packard
Co., The Santa Cruz Operation Inc., and possibly other vendors to ship
versions of those companies' Unix operating systems with integrated NetWare
services.
   That infrastructure strategy has also conveniently given way to new
phrases coined by Novell, such as Client Network Computing--a paradigm
whereby NetWare no longer competes head to head with Microsoft Windows NT.
Rather, Novell is pledging to better integrate its products with those from
Microsoft Corp. and has, for example, developed a working prototype of a
server interface between NetWare services and NT.
   ``We decided that we are not going to fight it out in [the
applications-server] market. Instead we will provide networking services to
all sides,'' said Novell CEO and Chairman Robert Frankenberg, whose Client
Network Computing concept includes a set of programmable services that
would be provided by the network. Under the company's abandoned plan for
SuperNOS--the hybrid operating system that had been slated to combine
NetWare 4.x and UnixWare--Novell would have competed squarely with
Microsoft on the applications-server front.
   And the newer, leaner Novell is not finished. On a conciliatory note,
Frankenberg admitted that his ``objective is to execute product plans on
time with great quality and not disappoint our customers. In the past we
haven't done that, so this will be an intense focus for us.''
   In recognizing that a directory-enabled infrastructure is nothing
without the software, Frankenberg has pledged to round up by year-end at
least six times as many of the 140 NDS-compliant applications that exist
today. As promised in last fall's product road map, in 1996 Novell will
also ship the Green River version of its operating system with support for
NetWare Distributed Print Services (NDPS) and its Net2000 SDK (software
developer's kit).
   And as many as 200 Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST)-enabled
devices will be available by year-end, as opposed to today's 24 products,
to spread the NetWare infrastructure within reach of office products.
   On the applications side, Novell is hanging on to its groupware product,
despite the pending sale of its other business applications, and is due to
ship its Lotus Notes competitor, GroupWise XTD, this year.
   Making ship dates is key, according to at least one reseller. ``We are
looking for Novell to stick to its schedule of new products,'' said Andrew
Percy, chief technology officer for systems-integrator Edge Information
Systems in San Jose, Calif. ``The three key pieces we are expecting for
next year as things that will help us develop our business will be the
arrival of SMP [symmetric multiprocessing] products through the OEM
process, the GroupWise XTD product, and the [Microsoft Windows 95] client
software.''
   Novell's Windows 95 client for NetWare is currently in its second beta
release.

To Be or Not to Be--Bought
   From the outside looking in, a whittled-down Novell may appear to be
turning itself into an opportunity ripe for acquisition. Not so, according
to Frankenberg, who contends he is simply busy divesting himself and the
company he runs from a strategy once bent on competing directly with
Microsoft. ``We have no interest in making ourselves more valuable to a
suitor. I actually think that we are more valuable independent.''
   Numbers show that Frankenberg--now in his second year at Novell's
helm--has his work cut out for him because, for the first time, the company
is facing a market-share battle. Last year Novell lost three points from
its leading position among NOS makers, dropping to 62.2 percent in a market
that reached $1.2 billion, according to a 1995 midyear LAN
operating-systems analysis by International Data Corp. in Framingham,
Mass.
   At the same time, IDC's report found that Windows NT is picking up steam
in a market where Novell has firmly held its ground. Although Novell was
heartened to find that NetWare 4.1 shipments reached 96,100 and earned 22.6
percent of the LAN OS market, many of those sales replaced NetWare 3.x
shipments.
   Among the OSes mentioned in the report, Windows NT managed to increase 
its market share by the greatest amount with shipments jumping 70 percent
between the first and second quarters of 1995. Windows NT landed a 13.3
percent share of the market for the first half of 1995, with 68,000
file-server licenses sold.
   This year, Frankenberg said he wants to ``gain that [lost market share]
back, plus a couple of more points.''
   But Novell's greatest challenge is in winning new installations, said
Jesse Berst, editor of Windows Watcher newsletter in Redmond, Wash. ``Both
NetWare 4.1 and Windows NT started from a very small base. So while the
companies trumpet about increases, it's not just the percentage of growth
year over year and not just unit shipments that's important. The key marker
is new business.''

Eye on the Internet
   Frankenberg is looking to add more Internet capabilities to Novell's
lineup, so the World Wide Web craze has not been lost on Novell. Last month
the company shipped its $995 NetWare Web Server and last November delivered
on its long-awaited AT&T NetWare Connect Services.
   Furthermore, Frankenberg outlined plans for Novell to become ``protocol
agnostic'' beginning with this summer's release of Green River, which will
include IP out of the box as a configuration option.
   Nevertheless, the company missed its year-end deadline to ship Ferret
and Corsair, Novell's browser and Internet-development environment,
respectively. And it is now in the shadow of a recent Web marketing thrust
by Microsoft. The software giant plans to integrate its forthcoming
Internet Information Server directly into Windows NT as a key piece of an
all-Microsoft Web-access solution.
   Frankenberg pointed out the bottom line when analyzing a product that
has yet to be delivered: performance. ``Think about what a Web server
does,'' he said. ``It's a file and print server in the form of printing
electronic documents. NetWare does that better than anything else on the
market.''

LAN TIMES SURVEY: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS

By:
Sean Pfister and Adrienne Russell

   LAN management can be compared to politics: Everybody talks about the
problems, but most people find it difficult to do anything about them.
   According to a recent survey of LAN Times readers, the network- and
systems-management problem is well-understood: As networks grow in both
size and complexity, so do the responsibilities of the LAN manager. At
various times any combination of network analysis and planning, server
management, and desktop management all fall under the purview of the
average network manager, but not with equal weight. Many, it turns out,
simply don't use available management tools.
   The most telling and least surprising finding from the survey is that
network managers can expect an increase in their workload for 1996. An
average LAN Times site is moving from one LAN segment to three LAN segments
per network manager in the next 12 months. Across all organizations
surveyed, the average number of PCs will increase a year from now by an
average of 8 percent and LAN segments will increase by 71 percent, but the
size of networking staffs are projected to decrease somewhat, from an
average of 11 to about nine.
   More than half of all managers surveyed are responsible for networks at
remote locations. Of these, about six in 10 manage remote networks from
local consoles. Despite this, 34 percent take at least one monthly trip to
a remote location for trouble shooting LANs. The 40 percent of managers not
administering remote networks locally take an average of five trips per
month for trouble shooting.

Setting Priorities
   With projected increases in LANs and PCs and no real growth in staff,
which aspects of network management do administrators think are top
priorities? Judging from the results of the survey, network managers are
more focused on the server and network-traffic parts of their jobs than on
issues related to desktop management, including software distribution and
metering and asset management.
   We asked LAN Times readers to rate the importance of key management
issues for the efficient functioning of their networks. The ratings were
conducted on a 1-to-6 scale, with 1 being ``not at all important'' and 6
being ``very important.'' We also asked managers to tell us how dependent
they are on hardware and software tools to help them with key
network-management issues.
   Respondents tend to consider the management of network-related issues
more important than desktop-related or financial and administrative issues
such as metering or asset and inventory control.
   Of the six categories we asked about, server management and network
traffic are on the top of the priority list for effective functioning of
the organization's networks. Seven out of 10 LAN administrators reported
that server management is important (a 5 or 6 rating), whereas slightly
fewer are concerned with network traffic. Just under half the managers
surveyed reported that managing specific network devices such as hubs and
routers is important. In contrast, for each of the three desktop-related
categories measured, one-third or fewer assigned a rating of 5 or 6 on the
importance scale.
   Network managers' responses to queries about their single greatest
management need range from the specific (``full implementation of SNMP'')
to the more general (``increased budgets, more time''), while passing
through the somewhat humorous (``software for managing people''). A rather
large portion of the respondents are concerned with network diagnostics,
traffic loads, performance monitoring, and so on.
   Just under half the network managers surveyed reported the use of
server-
management or network-analysis tools at their work locations. Four in 10
managers currently use network-device management.
   Desktop-management tools are less commonly used. Roughly 19 percent of
network managers surveyed use software-distribution tools, 28 percent use
software-inventory tools, and 33 percent use software-metering tools.
   For both the network- and desktop-related tools, the usage patterns vary
significantly depending on the size of the networks managed. At sites with
30 or fewer PCs installed, the percentage of network managers using network
solutions is generally lower than at larger sites. Only nine percent of
managers at small sites use network-based software distribution, for
example, compared with 37 percent at sites with 150 or more PCs.
   In the case of network-analysis tools, this difference is particularly
pronounced. At small sites, 24 percent of network managers analyze network
traffic flow, and at large sites, 78 percent do so.
   Even though large sites are more likely to manage desktops through the
network, they still follow the same general usage patterns as all sites:
Tools to manage servers, traffic, and network devices are more common than
network-based solutions for desktop administration.

Winds of Change
   Six months from now, however, this picture should look somewhat
different. Although the use of network-related management tools will
continue to outstrip desktop- related solutions, the gap will narrow.
   The fastest growth is predicted for software distribution over the
network, which will nearly double--from 19 percent to 37 percent--during
the next six months. Rapid growth is also expected for software metering
and inventory. More than half of LAN managers will use network-based
software metering, and 46 percent will use software-inventory programs.
   In spite of the projected growth in all categories, network-management
solutions are not particularly widespread now, nor will they be ubiquitous
in six months. Why are some network managers not using available tools?
Typically they reported that the tools, whether for network or desktop
management, are not necessary for the kinds of networks they manage.
   Respondents were also asked for each category whether price, difficulty
in use, or difficulty in evaluation had any bearing on their decisions not
to implement any of the network- or desktop-management tools. For each
category measured, the largest proportion of respondents indicated that
their networks do not require the types of tools specified.
   Among users of the tools, the typical reason offered for use is based on
the workload. Respondents indicated that the tools lessen the need for
support staff. Given the prognostication for personnel growth in the next
year, it's not surprising that network managers cite this when implementing
the tools.

NET THREAT TO NOTES PUTS LOTUS IN ACTION
Strategy embraces Web, lowers price

By:
By Brent Dorshkind

   Lotus Notes has an image problem--again.
   Just as users started to understand Lotus Development Corp.'s flagship
product, the World Wide Web threatens to make Notes irrelevant in the
groupware field it pioneered. Once again, the company faces an uphill
public-relations battle, this time to position Notes as a player in the
white-hot Internet market and the nuts-and-bolts messaging-applications
space.
   To that end, Lotus' latest communications strategy, announced last
month, folds key Internet technologies into the Notes platform. The company
has also revised Notes pricing to make it a more attractive client/server
messaging and groupware platform. However, critics fault the Notes-centric
Web strategy for doing little to attract new users while delivering a
lackluster client/ server messaging strategy.
   ``The issue with all of Lotus' Web efforts has been to facilitate
additional features for people who are already Notes users,'' said Andrew
Percy, chief technology officer at Edge Information Systems, a
systems-integration firm in San Jose, Calif. ``I don't believe it wins them
any additional business.''
   New and current Notes users will find a midyear upgrade to the Notes
release 4 server beefed up with Web-focused technologies, including HTTP
(HyperText Transport Protocol), HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language. In addition, the company
will give away InterNotes Web Publisher 2.0 free of charge when release 4
initially ships this quarter. Originally a $3,000 add-on product, Web
Publisher 2.0 translates Notes documents into HTML pages. Prior to the
midyear upgrade, release 4's HTTP functionality will be delivered via a
bundled, yet separate, HTTP server.
   With Internet protocol support, Notes servers will extend their audience
to include Web browsers in addition to Notes and MAPI (Messaging API)-based
clients. Notes will dynamically convert Notes documents to HTML or vice
versa, depending on which type of client accesses the server.
   Meanwhile, Notes release 4 clients will include the InterNotes Web
Navigator to let users browse the Web from within Notes. Web Navigator
requires a connection to a Notes server so remote users will have to dial
in to the Notes server for Internet access.
   ``The Web, in many people's minds, is a direct Notes competitor,
especially in information publishing,'' said Jamie Lewis, president of The
Burton Group, an industry-analysis firm in Salt Lake City. But Lewis added
that Notes can do some things that the Web-based products cannot, for
example field-level replication and sophisticated security functions such
as being able to hide fields of a document from certain users.
   According to Lewis, the question is, ``How much of Lotus' installed base
and how much of the new customer base--the potential marketplace--needs
those features?''
   That question clearly weighs on Internet-focused companies such as
Netscape Communications Corp. The company's recent activity validates the
Lotus strategy of blending groupware and the Web. Netscape purchased
Collabra Software Inc., whose Collabra Share brings discussion-database and
replication technologies into the Netscape fold. Moreover, the Internet
company last month added an E-mail server to its line of applications
servers.

Back to Basics
   Although the Internet is clearly the hot spot for Lotus, it is not the
sole focus of the company's 1996 communications strategy. Lotus has also
taken steps to ease the costs of deploying Notes as a messaging solution by
introducing the $55 Notes Mail client and dropping the price of the Notes
Desktop client from $155 to $69.
   Due to ship with Notes release 4, Notes Mail effectively replaces Notes
Express as the entry-level Notes client package. With Mail, users can work
with E-mail, document libraries, discussion databases, and the Internet via
the Web Navigator. Unlike Desktop, the new client will not be able to run
custom applications. Neither Mail nor Desktop have the
applications-development capabilities of the full Notes client.
   Mail's price gives Lotus a messaging and groupware package that should
effectively compete with Novell Inc. GroupWise XTD and Microsoft Exchange,
both of which are scheduled to ship this quarter. However, those low-priced
messaging platforms will also provide groupware functions such as
discussion databases and replication, perhaps blunting Lotus' competitive
edge.
   Moreover, GroupWise XTD and Exchange are shrink-wrapped ready-to-use
applications, whereas Notes is a development environment. Consequently, the
price of deploying a Notes network goes beyond the costs of clients,
servers, and applications administration to include the groupware
applications that supplement E-mail.
   ``The cost of Notes is not buying the product,'' said Percy. ``The cost
of Notes is accessing the features, which means developing applications.''

ORACLE HITS BUSINESS-APP SUITE SPOT

By:
Bradley F. Shimmin

   The integrated suite of services unveiled by Oracle Corp. last month
promises to drive down the cost of managing multiple line-of-business
applications.
   Set for delivery in March, the Oracle InterOffice Suite will couple
World Wide Web, E-mail, document-management, multimedia, client/server, and
even management services all within the Oracle7 RDBMS (relational DBMS).
The InterOffice Suite server will be available in Workgroup and Enterprise
editions for Intel Corp. CPU-based machines running Microsoft Windows NT
and SunSoft Inc. Solaris. It will rely on extensions to the Oracle7 RDBMS
that let users search, access, and manage multiple data types such as
audio, video, and text in a consistent and simple manner, said Joe
Vassallo, vice president of InterOffice products at Oracle in Redwood
Shores, Calif.
   Through a document-server extension, for example, users can search for
not just the contents of large text items but also the actual meaning of
those items, creating a summarization of the meaning in a text object.
   The InterOffice server will provide these services for Microsoft Windows
95 clients; however, it will also make them available from Oracle's Web
browser, called PowerBrowser, which will let developers give users access
to the same features from either Windows or the Web.
   Supporting both Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java and the Oracle Basic
programming languages, PowerBrowser lets developers reduce the number of
applications used on desktops, said Vassallo.
   By bringing traditionally nonrelational data such as Web documents,
groupware, E-mail, and video streams inside an RDBMS, InterOffice is also
capable of bestowing transactional capabilities traditionally found only in
RDBMSes, such as row-level locking, shared SQL, and read consistency.

Physician, Manage Thyself
   By centralizing these heterogeneous services within a single datastore,
which can be managed from a single console, Oracle hopes to lower
management costs by minimizing the number of applications servers required
in an organization, said Vassallo.
   For example, users can add access to real-time video services to an
existing Oracle RDBMS through the InterOffice suite without purchasing a
separate video server, Vassallo explained.
   Without a single solution, ``a company must buy a whole bunch of
separate management tools, databases, Web servers, workflow products, and
scripts to connect the Web server to the database server,'' said Dan
Kuznetski, research director for Unix and server operating environments at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
   Yet some believe that the most important aspect of the InterOffice Suite
is its capability to reduce cost of ownership through its effective
management of these services, said Kuznetski. ``By managing this one
package with one tool,'' he said, ``Oracle reduces installation, tuning,
management, and problem resolution.''
   To this end, the suite comes equipped with the InterOffice Manager,
which manages servers, clients, services, and even systems information
through Intelligent Agents.
   These agents, according to Oracle Chairman and CEO Larry Ellison, let
managers automate time-consuming tasks such as disk-space management,
backups, and even applications distribution. ``It helps you keep track of
all the software you have throughout the network because it does the
distribution for you,'' he said. ``So instead of running around with a
floppy disk, you just put one copy of the software on one server, which
distributes that software to other servers, which in turn distribute
software to client computers.''
   However, IDC's Kuznetski points out that although existing Oracle
installations will benefit greatly from the InterOffice Suite,
organizations already housing adequate solutions for individual components
will not be swayed without some strong marketing by Oracle. For example,
though the RDBMS itself is well proven, there are many products in the
suite without a track record that must compete with existing products.
``While the database piece is well proven as is, the management component,
the Web, workflow, and multimedia components are new,'' said Kuznetski.
   The Enterprise edition of InterOffice will retail for $14,995, and the
Workgroup edition will retail for $2,995.

IBM ALSO SWEET ON SUITES

By:
Bradley F. Shimmin

   IBM is a believer in the idea of a server-based applications suite, as
well. So much so, in fact, that it intends to combine no less than seven
server components within its soon-to-be-released suite, code-named Project
Eagle.
   To be available by the end of this quarter, Project Eagle will join
communications, Internet, database, transaction-processing, directory and
security, groupware, and management components across all of its hardware
offerings in the hope of giving customers a single-vendor solution that
meets not only a company's applications-services needs but its scaleability
needs as well, said Mark Nunn, IBM's worldwide brand manager for Project
Eagle in Armonk, N.Y.
   ``This provides fundamental, base technology layers that an organization
can rely on as rock solid and completely reliable, so they can bet their
businesses on this,'' Nunn said. ``Customers can start small and move to
larger systems.''
For example, because the suite's security, directory, and distribution
architecture is based on the Open Software Foundation's Distributed
Computing Environment, applications built with suite components such as IBM
DB2 and Lotus Notes can be easily scaled from IBM OS/2 PC machines to
OS/390 mainframes without extensive modifications, explained Nunn.
   ``Often when you start off with your first client/server application,
you start in a pilot mode, but that builds and builds as you become more
comfortable with it,'' Nunn said. ``Because companies look for multiple
lifetimes in these applications and data they are collecting, they might as
well invest them in systems that will be there for the long term.''

ALANTEC TO JOIN FORE'S SWITCH FOLD
Acquisition adds departmental and backbone LAN-switch expertise

By:
Michelle Rae McLean

   Continuing its buying spree of products that drive the need for ATM
backbones, Fore Systems Inc. last month purchased Alantec Corp. The buyout
adds high-end Ethernet switches to a product line that ranges from
remote-access multiplexers to carrier network switches.
   The stock-swap agreement, which will make Alantec a wholly owned
subsidiary of Fore, brings a mix of LAN-backbone and departmental switches
into the fold. The Alantec PowerHubs' support of multiprotocol routing may
prove key to Fore's plan to offer products that integrate legacy LANs with
ATM.
   The Alantec products ``give Fore the reach into the LAN side that it
needed,'' said Skip MacAskill, senior research analyst at The Gartner Group
Inc. in Stamford, Conn.
   Alantec's desktop, departmental, and backbone PowerHubs offer
higher-capacity switching than the desktop-only product gained in Fore's
May acquisition of Applied Network Technology Inc. Alantec's switches are
also the first to market in supporting multilayer forwarding, combining
both fast bridging and routing.
   ``Until other companies can add routing to their switches, the Alantec
products give Fore an important advantage and immediate product delivery,''
said MacAskill. Companies' router-based infrastructures will require the
integration point between legacy networks and ATM backbones to consist of a
product that supports routing, he said.

Running With the Routers
   Though switches are beginning to replace routers as the core device in
networks, the need for routing functionality has not disappeared. Alantec's
expertise in integrating routing capabilities in LAN switches should
complement other interswitch routing technology Fore acquired when it
bought RainbowBridge Communications Inc. last May.
   Fore is banking on departmental and backbone switches to drive bandwidth
usage, increasing customers' need for the higher-speed backbone that ATM
switches are designed to support.
   ``All our acquisitions and alliances are for products that provide
on-ramps to ATM and that help customers migrate to ATM,'' said Eric Cooper,
Fore's chairman and CEO.
   Alantec had already included ATM interfaces and Fore's SPANS ATM
software on some of its switches, and bringing that support to all PowerHub
models is a priority, said Cooper. Making those switches stronger edge
devices, which connect Ethernet segments to ATM backbones, could end Fore's
reliance on NetEdge Systems Inc. for that technology, said analysts.
   Fore will have to overcome the integration challenge of combining
network-management products typical to every acquisition. The company plans
to bring management of the PowerHubs under ForeView by the end of this
year. The companies also plan to merge their U.S.-based direct sales forces
and will likely maintain their distribution partners overseas.

IS MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY BLOCKING PROGRESS?

By:
Jeremiah Caron

   Often overlooked, somewhat misunderstood, and sometimes even scoffed at,
LAN-management technology may very well be the most daunting inhibitor to
more widespread adoption of client/server computing architectures in
corporate information systems.
   The problem can be attributed both to set-in-their-ways managers and to
technology vendors. But indications are that this situation is changing for
the better. Vendors and managers appear to grasp better than ever the need
to bring the control and accountability of a centralized computer system to
the chaos of distributed systems.
   In preparation for this issue's Manager's Outlook on LAN management
(``The LAN-Management Paradox,'' Page 23), LAN Times conducted a reader
survey to gauge opinions and use of today's technology (an analysis of the
results starts on the Cover). A paradox was revealed: A relatively low
usage rate of all but the most basic server and internetworking
device-management tools defied an overall understanding of the need for
better management tools due to increasing workloads.
   Many survey respondents stated that they simply did not need elaborate,
integrated management tools to do their job. In some cases, that response
can be attributed more to the technological failings and pricing of the
solutions out there than to a lack of need. In other cases, it's possible
that managers just aren't able to see the potential financial savings that
better network control affords.

Accepting the Inevitable
   However, as network managers move up the corporate-management food chain
it's a sure bet that the need for better client/server accountability and
more efficient management will become apparent.
   We're at a crossroads now. The fiercely independent adolescence of the
PC LAN is coming to grips with more button-downed enterprise
responsibilities. While LAN managers are still reluctant to
``mainframe-ize'' their environments by turning user-productivity tools
into terminals, they also expect technology vendors to meet their needs
with more flexible, integrated, and easy-to-use management capabilities.
   This expectation is evidenced by a sharp increase in positive responses
when readers were asked about their purchase plans for the next six
months.
   Thankfully, the internetworking, operating system, and utilities vendors
also seem to be getting it. The march of progress means that more
manageability will be built into applications and systems, representing a
move away from the add-on management mentality.
   That's good because it goes a long way toward solving another paradox
residing at the heart of the first: Too often today's management tools add
complexity and cost to a networking system, thus discouraging the very
managers they're designed to help.

EDITOR'S NOTE

By:
Leonard Heymann, Editor in Chief

   LAN Times is launching the Manager's Outlook report to give network
managers a comprehensive review of key issues facing them in 1996. Our goal
is to paint a detailed picture of both the products and the strategies
needed to solve the most demanding network problems.
   LAN management, the topic of our first Manager's Outlook, in particular
requires a thorough evaluation of both products and strategies. Looking at
just one angle of LAN management, such as the product side, portrays a
false view.
   Network-administration suites, for instance, are rapidly maturing
products that appear ready for prime time. But our survey reveals that
users are far from embracing them -- and, for that matter, LAN-management
products in general. Issues such as cost and training, as well as doubts
about whether the products offer any tangible benefits, are giving managers
cause for concern. So exploring the strategies, even ones as basic as
standardizing the desktop, is the only way to reveal the true state of the
art of LAN management.
   Our new Cost Justification column, written by Testing Center Manager
Tere' Parnell -- who has spent much of her time in the trenches as a
network manager -- also appropriately debuts with LAN management. Selling
products in general to management is one of administrators' most
challenging tasks. But selling management tools is even more difficult
because their benefit to the company isn't always obvious. Parnell's column
offers specific examples to prove the tools will boost the productivity of
your business.
   Manager's Outlook will appear quarterly, examining such topics as
multi-processing servers, groupware, and ATM migration. Let us know what
you'd like to see in these reports and whether we hit the target on LAN
management. Send your comments to lheymann@wcmh.com.

OUTLOOK FROM OREM
Novell CEO Robert Frankenberg chats with LAN Times' Director of Editorial
Products Susan Breidenbach and Associate News Editor Amanda Henry

Q. Novell's business applications are up for sale. Is there a sense that
the Microsoft Corp. strategy that was being mimicked by the acquisition of
WordPerfect just didn't work for Novell?

A. Yes. The attempt was to match Microsoft product category by product
category. It became clear to me that it could not be done.

Q. Is Novell now ceding the applications-server market to Microsoft and
Microsoft Windows NT?

A. We've said for a long time that NT's real competition is Unix--it's
not Novell NetWare. NetWare is a network operating system that provides
security and the capability to share, communicate, manage, and access
information across a wide and local area. That's its focus. The fact that
it is very lean,and you can put a database on top of it and use the
database manufacturer's tools to create an extraordinary price-performance
solution means that, yes, you can do a certain kind of application serving,
and you can do it better than on any other platform.
   We haven't ceded the applications-server market to Microsoft or Windows
NT. Microsoft doesn't own it yet. The Unix world is still much larger than
NT. And as we have talked about, we will have NetWare incorporated into
every copy of [The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.] SCO Unix and [Hewlett-Packard
Co.] HP-UX.

Q. How can you get something besides your own applications to support NDS
[NetWare Directory Services]?

A. First off, we now have 140 NDS applications shipping. Since the
beginning of 1995, we have shipped 25,000 SDKs [software developer's kits],
which is more than ever in our history. So we are paying attention to
developers, and frankly, Novell didn't pay enough attention to developers
in the past. We would love to see Lotus Notes make use of the directory. It
would make enormous sense for us and for them since Notes runs on top of
NetWare Connect Services [NCS]. With directories, as with many other
technologies, there is this chicken-and-egg question. Is NDS in enough
places so that it's interesting to developers, and are there enough
developers to make NDS interesting to users?

Q. What you have laid out here addresses infrastructure, but it's the
availability of NDS-compliant applications that will undo the
chicken-and-egg perception.

A. Part of what we've done is that with NCS, the directory underpins that
are in every environment. The second path is to get it into all of the Unix
systems. The directory is a service not just to manage components of the
network but to be used as the directory for applications services that are
written to it. It's not just for keeping track of users and what their
attributes are.
   One of the things you will see next year is the capability to access the
directory from an Internet browser and make use of the information that's
held in the directory. So instead of getting on the Internet and doing a
interminable search to find something, the directory can go right to the
topic that you're interested in.
   Frankly, this time last year was when we started shipping a directory
that was solid and that had the right utilities so that people had the
confidence that this thing was going to work. Up until then, there were
significant questions.

Q. One of NT's strengths is that it runs on non-Intel Corp. platforms.
What is happening with regard to NetWare and non-Intel platforms?

A. We dropped Processor Independent [PIN] NetWare. Unix is how we will
address NetWare running on non-NetWare platforms. We had a team of 100 for
each platform, and that was not cost justified.

Q. You have been criticized for being late with your strategy. If you had
it to do all over again, would you have implemented any sooner the changes
that you have recently made at Novell?

A. First, I had to unsnarl [the PIN partnership] mess. I also had to get
the products to work. Novell's and WordPerfect's flagship products didn't
work. Now we have put in place a framework that fixed the strategy. Could
it have been faster? Yeah, maybe. But not a lot faster.

IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT
Put off by high prices and a confusing marketplace, LAN managers shy away
from the very tools that aim to simplify their jobs

By:
Claudia Graziano

   Pick up any trade magazine, and you're bound to find more than a few
articles extolling the virtues of LAN-management software. Yet more than a
few LAN managers are passing up these software tools altogether, preferring
instead to stick to managing desktops, applications, servers, and other
devices manually--or not at all.
   Taken at face value, the results of the LAN Times 1995 Manager's Survey
paint a rosy picture of the state of LAN management. It would seem LAN
managers are doing so well they simply don't need the tools we write about.
But is that what LAN managers are really saying?
   By all accounts, the price of LAN ownership is high. Analysts from
groups such as Forrester Research Inc. and Gartner Group Inc. continue to
put the price of supporting networked PCs somewhere between $3,000 and
$5,000 per PC annually. Of that, roughly half is management-related costs,
analysts say. So how come more organizations are not using management tools
to help reduce these costs? One theory is that organizations aren't really
aware of how much they're spending to support LANs.
   ``LAN-management costs are hidden costs,'' said Waverly Deutsch,
computing-strategies services analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. ``The costs have to do with network downtime and the LAN manager's
time spent running from site to site.''
LAN managers know they spend too much time putting out the proverbial
fires. But many feel the available tools are more trouble than they're
worth.
   ``All we've been doing is trying to administer this thing,'' said Dave
Bullamore, computer consultant for North Carolina's Department of
Agriculture in Raleigh. ``We don't have any time to plan ahead or think
about the future.'' Bullamore, who is one of three IS staff members who
manage the NCDA's approximately 600 PCs spread out over 14 Novell Inc.
NetWare LAN segments, said cost and complexity are the two main reasons his
department has been slow to deploy management tools.
   ``The state is pretty tight about adding new positions, so we're being
forced to evaluate some network-management tools,'' he said. ``But we just
don't have the time to set up a test lab to evaluate all these tools. They
all have so many pieces. Just figuring out how to set them up is a lot to
learn.'' So far, Bullamore has chosen Novell's LANalyzer for keeping tabs
on traffic levels and Bay Network Inc.'s Optivity for managing the NCDA's
35 SynOptics Ethernet series hubs. But non-trouble-shooting tools are hard
to justify, he said. ``We're looking at [Intel Corp.'s] LANDesk Management
Suite and Novell's ManageWise, but they get pretty expensive when you start
talking $40 or $50 per node.''
   In fact, cost justification seems to be a problem for many organizations
when it comes to management tools.
   ``The question is not about whether to use management tools, it's who is
going to use the tools,'' said Ken Brown, industrial engineer at RR
Donnelly & Sons Inc. in Crawfordsville, Ind. ``A lot of these tools require
one person just to manage the software. Unless we can show that kind of
tool is cost-effective, like if it eliminated the need for staff, there's
no way it's going to get approved.'' Brown, whose job it is to review any
purchase requests that come from one of the organization's six LAN
managers, said his staff rarely asks for software funds.
   So exactly how is RR Donnelly managing its 700 PCs? ``Our network
managers are fairly well-experienced. Each handles about a hundred or so
PCs, and they seem to get everything they need done. Also, our users are
pretty well-educated. We have in-house training classes for them, so they
don't need a lot of support.'' But not everything at RR Donnelly is done
manually.
   Larry Freund, LAN administrator, said his department wrote its software
for administering the group's two Oracle Corp. databases and managing its
two IBM OS/2 LAN Server file servers. He also uses home-grown
applications-metering software. ``At the time we needed it, there weren't
any OS/2-based management tools,'' he said.
   For others with larger networks, the cost of management software is even
higher.
   ``By the time you buy the basic package and all the support and
training, [enterprise] management platforms become an extremely high-ticket
item,'' said Brian Sugano, manager of communications services for the
county of San Mateo in Redwood City, Calif. ``These types of tools are so
expensive they're really only applicable to large companies that have a
[wide-area] infrastructure to support,'' said Sugano, who uses IBM's
NetView 6000 for managing the county's 3,000-node network spanning multiple
city offices. ``Management platforms require extensive training to
configure the system,'' he said. Consequently, ``we've become a training
ground for NetView. It's hard to keep the trained people on staff.'' Sugano
added that he too struggles with the problem of cost-justifying tools.
``Management is an application nobody sees. It's hard to get money for
it,'' he said.

Making a Case for Tools
   Forrester's Deutsch agrees that tools on the market today are numerous
and somewhat immature but feels that ignoring management tools is a serious
mistake. ``Yes, tools are complicated. Yes, tools are hard to evaluate.
That's because every tool has its own interface, its own data repository,
its own way of executing actions.'' But management problems are going to
get worse, not better, she said. ``With more companies moving
mission-critical applications off host systems, network managers are going
to be faced with a lot more than user-productivity problems.''
   Not surprisingly, developers agree these tools are too important to
overlook.
   ``Management has been perceived as a value-add, and I think that's
absolutely wrong,'' said David Hamilton, systems- and network-management
product manager for Microsoft Corp. Trying to manage devices and
applications after they've been deployed is almost certainly going to lead
to downtime and poor service for networked users, he said.
   But developers, too, need to do their part to increase adoption of
management tools. Making products simpler to use, increasing integration
among so-called suites of tools, and committing to standards such as the
Desktop Management Interface (DMI) are a few ways vendors can help.
Fortunately, just about every major management-applications developer has
already pledged support for DMI, a budding standard that aims to make
desktops and related components universally manageable. But work is still
underway to give management applications a means for accessing DMI
data--how PCs and related components describe themselves--remotely.
   In the absence of a completed standard, vendors have yet to put their
development money where their mouth is. However, given the Desktop
Management Task Force's schedule for completing the specification's missing
link, it could be midyear before vendors are able to embed support for DMI
in their applications.
   The problem of integration, on the other hand, could take longer for
vendors to solve. Right now, suites offer little more than a convenient way
to purchase software, said Ted Schlein, vice president of networking and
client/ server technology for Symantec Corp., a management-applications
developer in Cupertino, Calif.
   ``Point solutions should leverage one another'' through functions such
as event forwarding and real-time data sharing. But ``there isn't a great
deal of that kind of integration yet,'' Schlein said.
   For its part, Symantec is embarking on a strategy to not only integrate
its own products but also work with other vendors to promote cross-product
integration. ``We don't want to have to force customers to do everything
the Symantec way. That's not real life,'' Schlein said.
   Symantec is just one of many vendors trying to deliver better integrated
LAN-management product suites. Competitors McAfee Associates Inc. and
Seagate Enterprise Man- agement Software Co., in particular, are grappling
with integrating product lines inherited through recent company
acquisitions. Not only do these companies face the challenge of pulling
together products with completely different development histories, but they
must do so at a more meaningful level than just at the GUI.
   For instance, Santa Clara, Calif.-based McAfee is working on reconciling
product lines acquired over the past two years from Automated Design
Systems Inc., Brightwork Development Corp., Saber Software Corp., and
Mountain Network Solutions Inc. And Seagate's newly formed management
division is busy sorting out product lines acquired from Frye Computer
Systems Inc., NetLabs Inc., and Network Computing Inc.
   Given the current state of flux of most of these products, many
developers are not surprised at LAN managers' reluctance to invest in
them.
   ``The massive consolidation in the industry brings up valid concerns
about the viability of these vendors,'' said Bill Larson, McAfee's
president and CEO. But Larson and others believe market consolidation is
ultimately good for LAN managers for a number of reasons. First, a
consolidated industry means fewer products for LAN managers to evaluate. A
second benefit is fewer points of contact--or even a single point of
contact--for technical support and training. Third, a
survival-of-the-fittest marketplace stands to yield more sophisticated
product offerings.
   Of course, the downside of all this consolidation is that LAN managers
are essentially put on hold while vendors sort out their integration
strategies.
   ``Because there are no integrated tool sets, people can't yet see the
vision of what's going to be possible,'' suggested Michael Howard,
president of Infonetics Research Inc., a consulting company in San Jose,
Calif.

The Art of Simplicity
   Making tools easier to evaluate and purchase is a subtler change
expected in the evolution of management software. Developers admit they
haven't done a great job of making tool purchases easy to justify to the
powers that be, but they say they're working on it.
   ``If administrators are not implementing tools, it's because we haven't
given them a reason. Vendors need to make a business case for management
tools, not just an IS case,'' said Ken Mackin, manager of the
systems-management strategies group at Intel. An avenue that Intel and
others are exploring to help get corporate types more involved in managing
the network is making data collected by management applications accessible
to de- partments other than IS. Inventory data, for example, should be
accessible to the finance and human-resources departments. ``Companies have
to have adequate systems management to know what the cost of ownership is.
Once you have cost of ownership, then you can justify the purchase of tools
because you can show how to reduce those costs.''
And while tools aren't likely to get any cheaper, they are supposed to get
simpler to use. As hardware and software become instrumented with
management--either through standards such as DMI or built-in devices and
even the operating systems themselves, developers say administrators will
see complexity drastically reduced. ``Right now, [management] vendors have
to play integrators,'' Mackin said. But once management becomes built in to
more components, vendors will be able to concentrate on managing the
network, not the management system.

REGAINING CONTROL OF THE DESKTOP
Standard configurations are today's panacea for controlling costs, but
their effectiveness may be short-lived

By:
Jill Marts

   While the majority of IS professionals applaud the added freedom the
personal computer provides users, many--especially those managing large
numbers of nodes--are finding the cost of maintaining disparate PCs too big
a pill to swallow.
   An effective and common solution is to restrict desktop configurations
by instituting policies and standards to give all desktops the same look
and feel. Many users, IS professionals, and industry analysts, however,
charge this practice is obliterating the personal from the PC.
   But standardized desktops offer a number of critical benefits, the most
important of which is cost-effectiveness. The less time managers spend
reconfiguring desktops, the more time they have to support and maintain the
network. Standardized nodes are also easier to manage--IS staff don't need
to maintain a mountain of different applications--and they're more secure,
which increases the integrity of the information system as a whole. These
advantages, claim the proponents of standardization, far outweigh users'
loss of control over their desktop environment.
   ``The time and effort we spent trying to diagnose individual problems
just wasn't worth it. Our desktop standard is by far the most
cost-effective thing we could do,'' said Gary Light, manager of advanced
technology at Concord Hospital in Concord, N.H.

Varying Levels of Control
   Solutions for regaining control of the desktop vary from such mild
measures as instituting restrictive policies to providing centralized
access to some or all applications on the server. An even more extreme
measure eliminates hard drives from PCs altogether.
   Which strategy you choose, or if you standardize at all, often comes
down to the size and type of network you manage. Large organizations stand
to gain the most from uniform configurations, along with those that don't
rely heavily on user creativity. Banks and health-care organizations are
good examples of companies that stand to benefit most. Their business
procedures are usually already standardized, so uniform desktops generally
do not adversely affect productivity. Software-development companies, on
the other hand, are probably not good candidates, because businesses of
this type usually depend heavily on user creativity.
   Most organizations that implement desktop standards take a
middle-of-the-road approach, which involves using one or two standards,
running some or all of the applications from the server, and instituting
policies.
   When Concord Hospital moved toward standardization, Light found it
necessary to develop two desktop standards. The common standard works for
approximately 75 percent of the hospital's users. It includes the Novell
Inc. NetWare 3.12 Requester and provides access to a half-dozen
applications on the server such as Novell WordPerfect, Microsoft Excel, and
Lotus Freelance Graphics. Only Microsoft Windows and the Windows swap files
are installed locally.
   Light found this standard wasn't feasible for the remaining 25 percent
of the hospital's workstations, most of which are located at nurses'
stations and require health-care-specific applications. Be- cause doctors,
nurses, and other medical personnel need to be able to walk up to any of
these workstations and access data, this alternate configuration had to be
highly standardized so that all clinical workstations would have the same
look and feel.

The Case of the Missing Tools
   The combination of uniform configurations and user policies that help
maintain the setup has paid off for Concord Hospital. Policies that
restrict users from bringing in software, copying it off the servers, or
editing files such as CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT have been mostly adhered
to.
   Whereas automated tools are readily available to help maintain the
configurations and enforce policies once they've been established,
Concord's IS staff hasn't taken advantage of them, other than using McAfee
Associates Inc.'s SiteMeter for metering software licenses on the server.
Missing from the playing field are automatic software-distribution and
inventory--tools that Light acknowledges contribute to a weakness in
Concord's strategy.
   ``Sooner or later we're going to have to get off the stick and find the
tools that work for us,'' Light says. ``But it takes a substantial amount
of time and energy to learn how to effectively use those packages.''
   Without software-distribution, metering, and inventory tools,
maintaining standard configurations amounts to a lot of leg work for IS
staff. Light's reticence to implement most of these tools echoes a larger
trend among network administrators in general. The LAN Times 1995 Manager's
Survey revealed that less than 35 percent of our readers are using
distribution, inventory, or metering tools (see graphic, Page 41).
   Light expects Concord's network to grow from 400 PCs to 800 PCs in the
next few years. By that time, he says, automated tools will be a
necessity.

Banning the Hard Drive
   For some organizations, centralizing all applications on the server and
providing one or two standard configurations is simply not enough.
   Andy Kiolbasa, networking chief of technology at ITT Fluid Technology
Corp., which designs, manufactures, and distributes pumps and valves, says
his company is sold on stringent desktop standards and policies. The
Midland Park, N.J.-based company has more than 2,000 workstations located
at sites in five countries.
   In 1987, ITT began eliminating hard drives from all its workstations.
Kiolbasa and his staff wiped out the existing ones and partitioned them
down to 20MB to be used as very fast boot disks or swap files. As new PCs
were added to the network, they were purchased without hard drives. Now,
with about 70 servers running NetWare 3.12, the company has more than 200
PCs without a single hard drive connected to each server. All applications,
including Windows, are centralized on the file servers.
   Kiolbasa's attitude toward desktop standards is matter-of-fact: ``There
isn't any reason to install [Microsoft] Word on 2,000 local hard drives and
then have some users destroy the configuration. We install one copy on our
server, make sure we have the proper licenses, and we're done.''
   Unlike many administrators, Kiolbasa doesn't see standardization as a
way to avoid using management tools. He uses ON Technology Corp.'s
WinINSTALL product for automatic software installations and updates. The
advantage, Kiolbasa says, is that the IS staff writes the routine only once
to give a new Windows user access to Word, for example, and WinINSTALL
automatically installs the program into the Windows environment when the
user logs in.
   The IS staff also uses Bindview Development Corp.'s BindView NCS to
monitor hardware and ensure users' configur- ation files conform to the
standard.

A Creativity Killer?
   While there's no shortage of standardization proponents, there are
others who contend this strategy isn't a panacea for all desktop-management
woes.
   Most administrators who manage desktops through standardization will be
the first to admit that there are at least some drawbacks. For one thing,
user resistance often runs high when administrators attempt to institute
standards in an environment that previously lacked them. And even with
successful implementations, IS professionals can't expect to get total
control of the workstations. Removing all hard drives, for example, works
well until someone gets a laptop.
   ``Given the constantly changing PC industry and the fact that users have
ultimate dominion over their machines, it's unlikely that any desktop
standard will remain standard for very long,'' said Chris Thomas, manager
of emerging technology for Intel Corp.'s enterprise-server group in
Hillsboro, Ore.
   Productivity issues surround standardization as well. Some argue it's
very restrictive to expect people to have only a certain set of tools in an
environment that uses PCs as personal-productivity devices.
   ``There are certain things that are good about policies and standards,
but the blanket approach is very short-sighted,'' said Steven Saks, vice
president of IS at the California Trucking Association (CTA) in Sacramento,
Calif. ``What you're doing is eliminating the unique abilities of each
individual and turning them into drones.''
   Saks opted to go light on standards at CTA and has placed more emphasis
on policies to manage the desktops on his 60-user, four-server NetWare
network. He limits creativity, he says, to a given product but never to
types of products. So, for example, he permits only one word processor and
one spreadsheet program, but doesn't forbid the use of other types of
applications on different desktops that individual users may need. In
addition, he has instituted policies that prevent users from sharing
workstations or passwords.
   Although consolidating products on a single platform or set of platforms
offers great potential for reducing cost of ownership, many agree that
offering a restricted set of products isn't a long-term solution.
   Intel's Thomas says that restricting desktop configurations is probably
the worst way to think about managing the desktop, but it is the easiest
option for administrators right now.
   ``As a way of getting your arms around the task, it's a good starting
point,'' Thomas said. ``But it doesn't replace the need to find solutions
that deal with the evolving desktop.'' Thomas emphasizes that the crux of
the problem is that the platforms themselves are not standardized on how
they set up and configure other products.
   The real, longer-term solutions to unruly desktops will most likely come
from vendors as they work to provide more manageable platforms and
products. Eventually, when most hardware and software adheres to some of
the simple standards of installation and management, it will be less
important for support staff to limit choice.
   Thomas compares the situation at hand to that of the telephone
industry--it was not until companies agreed on wiring infrastructures and
voltage levels that any phone from any company could be plugged in to the
wall and work. In the PC industry, as products consolidate and standardize
at the OS level, it will be easier to use different platforms more
readily.

TOOLS THAT FOLLOW THE RULES
A new breed of policy-based software promises to tighten security and cut
costs

By:
Claudia Graziano

   When Novell Inc. introduced NetWare 4.x two years ago, network
administrators found they had a lot more to contend with than just
installing the new enterprise NOS. For the first time, many administrators
were required to organize a standard naming convention for networked
resources and establish guidelines for giving users access to those
resources. In short, upgrading to NetWare 4.x meant instituting
corporatewide policies to govern the network.
   Since then, the idea of policy-based management has caught on as a way
to reduce administrative costs, tighten security, and even speed
trouble-shooting by setting standards for dealing with a variety of
situations, ranging from adding new users to the network to reacting to
system faults. To make the process of coordinating corporate policies and
management practices easier, network- and systems-management applications
developers have begun building policy-based management capabilities into
their tools.

Automatic Management
   Policy-based management may seem like a futuristic prospect, but it's
closing in on reality--many administrators already have policies in place
to help them manage the network. Backing up file servers every Friday, for
instance, or inventorying the network twice a year are examples of common
policies used to maintain network operations. The only difference is that
these policies aren't automated. Rather than being organized in a database,
management policies are often written on scratch pads, saved in E-mail, or
just noted mentally.
   Management-applications developers are out to change this scenario to
help organizations take control of growing enterprise networks.
   ``The advantage of policies is that they ensure a consistent
environment. Client/server environments that are not consistent break,''
said Scott Harmen, vice president and general manager of Tivoli Systems
Inc.'s applications-management division in Austin, Texas. Security
management, for example, requires policies to determine which users have
access to what network resources. Without such policies, security is bound
to be compromised. Policies can also help streamline administration tasks,
such as configuring new users' desktops and preventing the use of
unauthorized software.
   The key to policy-based management, of course, is automation.
Administrators of mainframe and Unix environments have long used
job-scheduling utilities to automate certain tasks. Now those same types of
tools are finding their way into the PC LAN world. Seagate Enterprise
Management Software Co.'s Ashwin, for example, lets administrators schedule
background and after-hours processing jobs for Microsoft Windows NT and
Windows 95 machines, as well as Unix workstations and IBM mainframes and
minicomputers.
   ``Basically, any utility that has script-writing capabilities can
accomplish rudimentary automation,'' said Waverly Deutsch,
computing-strategies services analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass. What's needed are applications that not only automate
administrative tasks but also provide an interface for managing the
policies themselves.

The Ground Up
   Two applications developers that are pioneering policy-based management
at the desktop are McAfee Associates Inc. and Symantec Corp. Last March,
both companies licensed code from Microsoft Corp. that will let each
developer exploit management capabilities already built in to the Windows
95 operating system. Specifically, the code provides links to the Windows
95 Registry, which records changes to desktop configurations. The code will
also provide links to an embedded policy editor, which contains 50
predefined user-configuration ``profiles.''
   By tapping the Registry and the embedded policy editor, McAfee,
Symantec, and others will be able to create applications that can centrally
manage desktops on the basis of administrator-defined policies. For
example, user access rights, start-up applications-- even background
colors--can all be defined from a remote-management console.
   McAfee plans to release the first application that incorporates the
licensed code next month. The new product, called Saber Tools 1.0, is a
combination of McAfee's NetTools and the former Saber Software Corp.'s
Saber Menus. According to Product Manager David Wilbanks, Saber Tools will
extend Microsoft's desktop policy-editor functions to the server, letting
administrators browse Novell's NetWare directory to select individuals or
groups of users for applying policies.
   Although administrators can already access Microsoft's policy editor
remotely, changes can be made only for one user at a time, Wilbanks said.
And the embedded policy editor has no system for manipulating several
policies at once. In contrast, SaberTools will let several policies be
grouped and applied to users with a single command.
   Policies that administrators might choose from the Saber Tools policy
editor include restricting users' access to files, directories, servers,
and even executeables. Policies that restrict users' access to the start
menu, for example, can be helpful in reducing the number of support calls
to the help desk.
   ``If users accidentally change or delete their IP settings, they may
lose their network connection,'' said Wilbanks. ``This could take up to 30
minutes to fix.''
   Other policies may enforce company directives, such as not bringing
software from home. Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks and Norton
Desktop Administrator--both slated to incorporate policy-based management
by mid-1996--will let administrators set policies that deny users access to
the network if virus checking or metering is disabled at the workstation.
   ``There's been no way to enforce this level of security in the past,''
said Jonathan Niednagel, senior product manager for Symantec in Cupertino,
Calif.
   Policy-based management is also making its way into high-end management
applications. Last June, Hewlett-Packard Co. introduced an add-on to its HP
OpenView platform, called AdminCenter. The Unix-driven management software
is aimed at streamlining administrative jobs such as configuring users and
applications. But unlike emerging PC-based solutions, AdminCenter provides
a sophisticated mechanism for organizing policies and reconciling
conflicting policies.
   The software uses a knowledge base to store the policies hierarchically.
Administrators can designate policies for the global environment, for
specific domains, or even for specific workstations. AdminCenter
automatically assigns ratings to policies that allow very specific,
low-level policies to overrule more general, high-level policies.
   For example, a high-level policy dictating that only users with an ID
number between 100 and 500 can access the accounting server may be
overruled by a low-level policy that says users in the remote accounting
office can also access the server. But high-level policies are overruled
only if the administrator who writes the low-level policy has the
appropriate access privileges.

In a Similar Vein
   Tivoli Systems Inc. offers a similar product for policy-based systems
administration called Tivoli/Admin. Part of the Tivoli Management
Environment product suite, Tivoli/Admin lets customers attach policies to
any systems-management function controllable from the TME console.
Currently, the software supports only Unix clients and servers, but Tivoli
is promising a version of its Admin product that runs on Microsoft Windows
NT Server in the first quarter. The new version of Tivoli/Admin will let
customers control not only Unix and Windows NT clients but also Windows and
NetWare clients.
   Like HP's AdminCenter, Tivoli/Admin uses object-oriented code and a
rules-correlation engine to manipulate default and user-defined policies.
However, it has no system in place for resolving policy conflicts.
   ``Basically, the most recent policy wins,'' said Martin Neath, vice
president and general manager for TME core products.
   But for some, this lack of higher intelligence is a minor detail.
   Steve Henderson, systems engineer for GTE Telephone Operations Corp. in
Tampa, Fla., said Tivoli/Admin saved his department from having to
continuously modify and develop its own internal policy-based management
software.
   ``The [policy-based management] software we'd written was a maintenance
nightmare. Somebody had to recompile the code every time there was a
change. It just didn't evolve naturally,'' he said. ``But doing things one
machine at a time just wasn't going to work for us.''
   Henderson's group began rolling out Tivoli/Admin more than two years
ago, when the concept of policy-based management was unknown to most. But
faced with several thousand Unix clients to manage, Henderson said his
group had a vested interest in putting its mainframe experience to work in
the client/ server world.
   Although Tivoli/ Admin has helped reduce the administrative burden, the
product provides little in the way of security enforcement. ``Tivoli/Admin
doesn't really cover things like controlling access to certain servers once
users get on the network,'' Henderson said.
   The benefits of policy-based management aside, analysts say the
technology's inherent complexity may not be worth the pain of implementing
such solutions for some organizations.
   ``It's very, very difficult to implement a policy-based management
system,'' said Jill Huntington-Lee, senior analyst with Datapro Information
Services Group in Delran, N.J. ``Not only do you have to deal with feeding
a lot of data into these systems to get started, you have to deal with a
lot of internal company issues.''

Corporate Culture Cops
   In fact, defining corporate policies for the software to enforce has
proved such a challenge to early adopters of Tivoli's Admin product that
the company retains a team of integrators to help customers through the
process.
   ``You have to have a clear business case for implementing policy-based
management,'' Huntington-Lee continued. The technology can be particularly
valuable to financial, government, research, and other organizations where
access to systems needs to be strictly regulated, she said.
   Regardless, companies need to do a lot of work beforehand to get the
most out of policy-based management.
   Companies evaluating this technology ``need to examine the
administration processes they have in place now and compare that to the
processes they want automated,'' said Huntington-Lee. From there, companies
need to figure out whether the products that are available present a
realistic solution.

THE FUTURE WITH OR WITHOUT SNMP
Vendors are delivering their own technologies in the absence of
standards-based SNMP solutions

By:
Sylvia Clark

   Ask LAN administrators to name their standard for network management and
most will answer SNMP. But despite its popularity, the protocol has some
profound limitations that make it inappropriate for managing every LAN.
Proposed revisions to SNMP are also steeped in controversy, as proponents
of alternative management strategies butt heads over standards for
controlling networks.
   Network management ought to be simple: Managing network devices from
multiple vendors requires a standard for defining and gathering management
information. Today that standard is SNMP, but the protocol wasn't intended
to be a long-term solution.
   The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) originally proposed the SNMP
standard as a stopgap measure until businesses could migrate from TCP/IP to
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)-standard networks, which were expected
to include a robust and secure network-management standard. When this
migration failed to occur and TCP/IP grew even more popular, the IETF
attempted to approve a new version of SNMP to address its shortcomings.
   Unfortunately, the new version has failed to appear, and administrators
are now left with growing networks and no effective way to manage them.

Defining the Limits
   Some of SNMP's limitations stem from its architecture, which uses
passive agents on clients that are activated only when polled by a
management application. This design is SNMP's first drawback: Polling
consumes a significant portion of network bandwidth and can limit what's
left for business applications. And because the agents can't proactively
report exceptional events, SNMP managers must continuously collect and
process information--even when no problems exist--which limits the number
of devices a single console can manage.
   SNMP also lacks any means of communicating among managers, so the
management function can't be distributed. This effectively limits SNMP's
scaleability and, therefore, capability to meet the requirements of a large
organization.
   Even if management could be distributed, SNMP couldn't deliver the
sophisticated information needed to tune a complex network. This is because
SNMP managers cannot retrieve large amounts of data, such as a complete
routing table, in a single inquiry. The MIB (Management Information Base)
format, used to store collected data on the client, is inflexible, and
SNMP's TCP-centric nature means it does not mix well with the IPX, OSI, and
AppleTalk networks found in most large organizations.
   Another drawback is that managers' agent-to-manager communications are
rudimentary at best. Agents can notify managers of problems but have no way
of verifying the information was received, and they can't provide any
detail in the notice. Instead, the manager must poll the agent to determine
what happened.
   The worst of SNMP's drawbacks is that the protocol turns a blind eye to
security. It doesn't provide for authentication or data encryption, which
leaves agents open to manipulation by unauthorized managers. It also
permits the interception of authorized commands.
   The IETF attempted to fix the limitations of SNMP by producing a second
version of the protocol, SNMP version 2. But this standard has been plagued
by conflict among the proponents of differing technologies. The result has
been a confusing series of different SNMP 2-proposed standards.
   Originally developed in 1993, the SNMP 2 proposal provided for security,
bulk information retrieval, manager-to-manager communications,
remote-configuration capabilities, protocol enhancements that would expand
its usefulness beyond TCP networks, and other performance enhancements.
   But after reviewing the proposal it developed, the IETF deemed SNMP 2
too difficult to implement and use, especially in the area of security.
After much debate within the IETF over two competing security models,
called SNMP 2* and USec (Users-based Security), the SNMP 2 working group
suggested an interim version of the protocol that would omit the original
revision's controversial elements.

Attempted Revamp Also Stalled
   This ``new'' SNMP version is referred to as SNMP2t, SNMP2C, SNMP1.5, or
just SNMP 2 and includes commands for retrieving large quantities of data
to give management applications better performance, better error messages
to help management applications better diagnose configuration problems, and
protocol enhancements.
   However, the updated version 2 also lacks some of the most-needed
critical enhancements--security, manager-to-manager communications, and
remote configuration--and falls short in solving a wide range of
network-management problems.

Not Up to the Challenge
   Unfortunately for network professionals, this situation won't be
resolved anytime soon. The IETF has decided to suspend work on the updated
SNMP 2 until September, hoping that a cooling-off period will bring
agreement when work resumes.
   Meanwhile, outside the IETF in an unofficial capacity, a ``blue-ribbon
panel'' of users and vendors is attempting to develop yet another solution.
Tentatively called SNMP version 3, this SNMP standard is designed to have
more security and functionality than the current SNMP 2 and could
ultimately become a de facto standard if it is adopted by systems vendors.
   But SNMP 2--if it is delivered at all--will ultimately be a day late and
a dollar short. It will not be much use to LAN managers because the
deficiencies addressed by version 2 are not critical, so the benefits of
upgrading don't justify the costs of replacing existing SNMP technology
investments.
   This situation leaves administrators faced with a network-management
dilemma: SNMP is not up to managing large complex networks--let alone the
whole IT infrastructure--and SNMP 2 is delayed and deficient. OSI's Common
Management Information Protocol, on the other hand, has the scaleability
and security to handle today's large heterogeneous networks, but little
commercial support exists for it outside the telecommunications industry.
   In the absence of standards-based solutions to solve management
problems, suppliers are delivering their own technology to provide
customers with much-needed management functionality.
   Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Solstice Cooperative Console (CC), which is an
add-on that links multiple Solstice SunNet Manager management servers
within an enterprise, is a good example of a product that has developed
value not found in SNMP today.
   Solstice CC performs selective data replication by sharing topology,
event, and SNMP trap information with servers using Sun RPCs (remote
procedure calls) and real-time connections. This capability gives
administrators management control over other domains. Solstice CCs can be
configured as peers so each has full control over the other's domain, or
they can be centralized or divided by geography or area of expertise.
   Fujitsu Ltd. has a similar module for its NetWalker SNMP management
platform. And other vendors are expected to develop similar solutions. In
fact, early this year, multiple suppliers are planning a collaboration to
create interoperable Solstice CC-type solutions, allowing disparate manage-
ment consoles to share information.

Circumventing the Process
   Solutions such as this, in which technology is shared among several
suppliers, not only will yield better scaleability for a single-vendor's
platform but will also give network managers the benefits of an official
standard, including competitive pricing, interoperability, and no vendor
lock-in.
   Long overdue, this solution nicely sidesteps the broken-down
standards-approval process. If it emerges as a common solution, it could
evolve into a de facto standard or even gain the acceptance of an official
standards body for solving manager-to-manager communications problems in
SNMP.
   But for now, the reality of SNMP is that it was never intended to do
more than basic monitoring and management of network devices, so it can't
be extended to incorporate systems management. Its prevalence makes it a
tempting choice, but until suppliers somehow expand the technology, SNMP
management platforms and applications will never provide requisite
functionality, scaleability, and security.
   SNMP's convoluted evolution is a good example of what happens when
standards bodies fail to deliver timely solutions. In the absence of such
solutions, market pressures eventually force vendors to step in and provide
the needed technology. It's possible that collaboration among
network-management vendors may give the IETF the stimulus it needs to get
back on track. But what's certain is that the demands of customers are
growing too complex to tolerate the bottlenecks caused by a delay in the
standards-approval process.

OUTSOURCING'S REFINED ALTERNATIVE
An a la carte strategy is quickly gaining ground over the four-course
approach to outsourcing

By:
Jill Huntington-Lee

   When the job of managing a network gets too big for an internal IS
staff, most companies call on outsourcers to pick up the slack. But while
these consultants can work miracles getting your company up to speed on the
latest technology and methodologies, they're also expensive and often
demand the authority to make over your network in any way they see fit.
   But a scaled-back alternative to expensive consultants, called
``out-tasking,'' is rapidly gaining ground and promises some relief for the
tenacious conflict between growing networks and shrinking budgets.

   Out-tasking uses ``boutique'' consultants to handle specific,
well-defined activities of a LAN-management or other IS effort. In contrast
to the four-course dinner approach of big systems integrators, out-tasking
is strictly a la carte--a strategy its proponents say prevents runaway
systems projects and unneeded services.

Getting a Jump Start
   Inventory and asset management, performance analysis, and automated
backup are three of the fastest growing out-tasking services today.
Server-performance analysis, software-distribution services, cable
management, and even network- and systems-resource accounting and
charge-back services will soon be available from specialized providers.
   Out-tasking lets user organizations jump-start important but
long-neglected management tasks such as inventorying desktop hardware and
software, analyzing network-performance trends, instituting automated
backup, and building an adequate help-desk infrastructure. Critical tasks
such as these aren't complicated, but they are time-consuming--and that
makes them perfect candidates for out-tasking.
   Customers who have contracted out-taskers for these services are
reporting dramatic gains. At ASC Services Co., a Chicago-based IS
consultancy that specializes in architectural and construction issues, MIS
Manager David Weinstein drastically cut the time needed to inventory a
customer's PCs by giving the job to out-tasker Micropath Inc. in Bellevue,
Wash.
   ``Micropath is conducting a complete inventory of our client's network,
which spans more than 20 offices across a five-state region,'' Weinstein
explained. ``This effort would take me over a year--Micropath is doing it
in less than three weeks.''
   According to Bill Holder, director of operations at Micropath, the
company's business is based completely on out-tasking inventory chores.
``Our customers typically don't have enough staff to adequately inventory
thousands of PCs,'' he said.
   A true specialist, Micropath comes armed with its own software and a
full suite of commercial inventory packages. The company also offers a
60-page, step-by-step methodology for do-it-yourself inventories, but most
clients let Micropath do the work. ``Our customers usually want us to
perform the initial inventory because we've done this many times before,''
said Holder. ``When we're done, we leave behind a database and a management
report with recommendations for ongoing asset-management and
change-management policies, so the customer can maintain it themselves on
an ongoing basis.''
   Of course, administrators building a network from scratch are in a
better position to use a disciplined approach to inventorying from day
one--but most organizations don't have the luxury of starting from a clean
slate.
   ``In the 1980s, many companies were buying PCs like crazy,'' Weinstein
said. ``But often, the records kept weren't adequate, and no one really
knew who had what or what software was out there.'' A comprehensive
inventory is a crucial first step toward positive network management and is
required by many network-management programs.
   Inventorying is only one area targeted by out-taskers. Performance
trending and analysis is another fast-growing service. Out-taskers take the
gigabytes of cryptic data churned out by systems-management tools and turn
it into cogent reports showing patterns and trends.
   ``Often network administrators lack the time to develop the software and
processes necessary to support thorough performance analysis,'' said Steve
Waldbusser, principal architect for out-tasker International Network
Services Inc. (INS) in Mountain View, Calif. ``Writing scripts or programs
to support those processes takes even more time. We provide the processes
as well as the software, so the solution is about as turnkey as it gets.''
While a performance-analysis service is certainly appealing to companies
lacking technical staff, even large companies with vast technical expertise
find time-saving services such as those offered by INS cost-effective. INS
claims as clients several of the nation's largest banks and many regional
Bell operating companies.

Glass-House Performance Stats
   Performance analysis also appeals to network managers with glass-house
experience. ``I came from a background of minis and mainframes, so I was
used to getting hard statistics on performance,'' said Jim Sedlacek,
network-planning manager for Cleveland Clinic. ``We use [Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s] SunNet Manager for monitoring about 30 routers, but we didn't have
a way of putting all the raw statistics into useful reports without a lot
of programming.''
   About a year ago, Sedlacek learned about the performance-analysis
services provided by 3DV Technology Inc. in Chicago. 3DV's RouterPM service
provides in-depth reports of Cisco Systems Inc. routers, including
serial-line utilization, bidirectional analysis of congestion at the
LAN/router interface, and interface-related signal-quality problems.
   3DV handles everything, including installing proprietary data-collection
software on a Microsoft Windows NT-based PC running on an Intel Corp. 486.
The software, which supports distributed polling, queries routers 24 hours
a day and converts raw data into trended reports in weekly or year-to-date
format.
   Currently, 3DV's performance-analysis reports are restricted to MIB
(Management Information Base) II objects and variables stored in the
private MIBs of Cisco routers. 3DV plans to expand its support to include
Cabletron Systems Inc. hubs in the near future. Competitor INS supports
RMON (remote monitoring) and Cisco private MIB objects, as well as Bay
Networks Inc., 3Com Corp., and Chipcom Corp. devices and MIB II and Cisco
routers.
   The dramatic growth of startup out-taskers hasn't been overlooked by
mainstream IS consultancies, which are busy developing out-tasking services
of their own.
   ``While we are capable of full-service outsourcing, most of the services
we offer today are out-task,'' said Dennis Duyme, director of program
management for enterprise-network management at Bell Atlantic Network
Integration Services in Frazer, Pa. Unlike 3DV or INS, Bell Atlantic's
service supports performance analysis through an active in-band connection
to the customer's site.

Slashing Monitoring Costs
   Bell Atlantic compiles baseline-performance information and provides
trend-analysis reports on selected devices, the 10 busiest devices by
month, router ports, and router-interface error profiles. According to
Duyme, his company can provide fault and performance monitoring for just 40
percent of what it would cost customers to do it themselves.
   Administration isn't the only cost that can be pared by out-tasking. The
BBN Systems and Technologies Division of Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., claims its analysis of networks can save customers from
buying too much bandwidth.
   Using an internally developed tool called StatsWise, BBN staffers
analyze the health, capacity, and traffic levels of a customer's network.
The service is targeted at companies that have tried to resolve performance
problems by buying more band-width but haven't seen the expected
improvement, according to Pete Nelson, director of marketing for BBN's
Enterprise Management Group. ``We're able to use StatsWise to gather
detailed information about how the network is actually behaving over
time,'' Nelson said. ``Then, we can make recommendations for reconfiguring
the network based upon this information. Some customers request baselining
annually, but most want it on a monthly or quarterly basis.''
   Automated backup is another network-management function that's a good
candidate for out-tasking. Rimage Corp. in Minneapolis, a provider of
floppy disk-replication services, has launched a rapidly growing backup
service called Televaulting that automatically backs up network file
servers to an offsite location. For charges that the company says typically
run from $250 to $350 per month, Rimage installs an agent on a nondedicated
node at the customer's site. At a prescheduled time, the agent logs in to
each server and backs up the data via an ISDN connection to a regional
Rimage site. File encryption helps ensure security while in transmission
and at Rimage as well.
   A typical departmental server with 2GB of data takes less than an hour
to back up, said Keith Stacy, general manager of the Televaulting service.
``After encryption and compression, the amount that is actually transferred
is usually between 1 [percent] to 2 percent of the client data files
[because] only incremental changes are transferred during a typical backup
session.'' Customers can request full backup periodically for archival
purposes, usually on a quarterly basis.
   Although most customers are initially interested in Televaulting for
disaster-recovery purposes, many end up using it to supplement or even
replace their daily tape-backup processes. Televaulting stores its
customers' data in optical-jukebox storage systems, allowing for rapid
recovery in the event of data loss at the customer's site. The base fee for
Televaulting is $150 per agent per month, with small incremental fees for
the number of megabytes transferred. For a 100-user network, typical
billing fees run about $250 to $350 per month.

Can You Really Trust an Outsider?
   Although the concept of out-tasking is permeating the network-management
community, network administrators still question the wisdom of a third
party handling even well-defined areas of network maintenance, operations,
and planning. Many organizations retain highly competent
technical-operations and support staff, capable of writing scripts and
evaluating performance.
   Ultimately, the tab for managing a network is not only the salaries of
the support staff but also the cost of opportunities missed when resources
are unavailable. It's important to ask yourself whether you want your best
people counting computers and answering phones. Out-tasking, when used as
part of a focused systems-management effort, can free talented computer
professionals to pursue loftier goals.

THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE LAN MANAGER
Accelerating technologies and the need to simplify their effects are
placing new demands on network professionals

By:
Susan Breidenbach

   There seems to be a sudden acceleration in the advance of technology and
its applications today. It's as if information networks have reached some
critical point of evolution and are starting to take over their human
masters, like the cyborgs in ``The Terminator.''
   LAN managers have never had to cope with such fast-paced change.
   ``I've been in this business for 12 years, and I've never seen a time
when things were moving as rapidly as they are now,'' said Greg Scott,
information-services manager for Oregon State University's College of
Business in Corvallis.
   A lot of different elements--robust client platforms, symmetric
multiprocessing, distributed databases, directory services, faster
networks, telephony, new WAN services, maturing middleware, and better
development tools--are all converging in the PC LAN space. The scope and
complexity of what LAN managers have to deal with has increased
significantly. Individuals who previously confined themselves to the bottom
layers of network computing now have to know what goes on in the upper
layers to understand the impact of client/ server applications on the
network.
   ``It's getting very sticky,'' said Mark Brooks, a senior LAN specialist
for TIAA-CREF in New York. ``It's one thing to do [Network General Corp.]
Sniffer-type trouble-shooting, but it's a whole different ball of wax when
you're trying to diagnose problems in the upper layers. You have to get
involved with client/server equipment, which traditionally was handled by
the programmer group.''
A class of tools for trouble-shooting client/server applications is
emerging, but it is plagued by a lack of standards and use of experimental
technology. The products are very expensive and difficult to use, and some
radical improvement is needed before they can bail LAN managers out.
   Meanwhile, client/server applications are creating some unusual
problems. ``You end up having strange, sporadic occurrences you can't
identify, and everyone says, `It's not me,' '' said Brooks. LAN managers
have to be able to make very fine-tuned changes to the servers or clients
or the infrastructure in between. And to do that, they need to grasp the
whole picture.
   Life was a lot simpler when LAN managers just had to know Novell Inc.
NetWare and how to get to the mainframe. But LAN managers who are still in
this mode are an endangered species threatened by an almost universal move
toward centralization and standardization. The autonomy that was the
hallmark of the original PC LANs is falling victim to the need to achieve
some economies of scale and make things easier to manage.
   ``Our company is trying to find the right mix of centralization and
departmental autonomy,'' said Bill Eckenrode, a senior network specialist
at E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. in Wilmington, Del. ``The trend was
decentralization for a long time, but in the last six to 12 months we've
moved back to a more centralized philosophy. The company is trying to adopt
an end-to-end service paradigm, getting everyone to be part of a larger
whole.''
Not all LAN managers like to acknowledge this state of affairs. ``There is
a reluctance to say the mainframe people were right--that we need to have
more centralization,'' said Brooks.

Centralization Ups the Ante
   Instead of having a lot of little database servers and point solutions
scattered among various divisions and departments, with multiple
intermediary boxes between the database and the end station to accommodate
a mix of protocols and operating systems, companies need to consolidate
them into a few bigger servers running enterprise solutions on standard
platforms.
   Basic server administration and management, such as backup, external
communications, and security, can then be centralized. And applications
development can be decentralized to provide some solutions flexibility.
   Yes, putting more people on bigger servers can strain existing network
infrastructures. But upgrading those infrastructures will be a lot cheaper
in the long run than building up staffing in small, decentralized groups.
   All this centralization increases the challenge--and associated risk--of
being a network professional. LAN managers who have been installing NetWare
for years suffer sticker shock when they see the price of a Microsoft
Windows NT-based server with dual Intel Corp. Pentium 100MHz processors,
140MB of RAM, and a 20GB disk array. Some of these systems can cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Challenge From the Specialist
   An even greater source of stress is the increasing importance of LANs
and the applications and data they deliver. A few years ago they were a
minor appendage to a company's information systems. Today they are the
information system for a lot of businesses. Organizations are putting a lot
of trust in a few individuals, expecting them to sort through all the
complexity of network computing and keep things under control.
   ``The stakes are higher these days--a little higher than many LAN
managers are comfortable dealing with,'' said Ken Kozikowski, information
center manager for T.J. Maxx in Framingham, Mass.
   While the demands of client/server computing are broadening the
requisite knowledge base of the LAN manager, other forces are pushing skill
development in the opposite direction. Specialization tends to be a
byproduct of centralization.
   Departmental LAN managers had to be generalists, but centralized
organizations can build up teams of specialists with deep knowledge in
certain areas. But specialist status is a double-edged sword.
   It's nice to have a skill that is in high demand right now, but going
down the specialist path limits future options.
   ``A lot of people are resistant to specialization,'' said Sandra
Lieb-Geiger, technical-support supervisor for Andersen Consulting in San
Francisco. ``You try to turn them into an expert, but they are concerned
that the need for expertise in that area might vanish overnight as
technology takes a sudden turn.''
   Technology does take sudden turns, and the road is starting to fork,
too, with the network infrastructure splitting off from network resources.
LAN managers will have to decide which path to take.
   ``On the Internet, resources and infrastructure are not the same thing
and are not managed by the same people'' said Patrick Corrigan, managing
director of The Corrigan Group in Portland, Ore. ``The same thing will
happen on corporate networks.''
   Meanwhile, today's LAN managers have to be familiar with all the
different client and server environments, the applications, the
infrastructure, and the WAN links. With expanded responsibilities and
downsized staffs, they have less time to wade through more information.
   ``I'm not an expert in the client/server area, but the peek I've had
behind the curtain is very sobering,'' Scott said. ``You can suck up the
information you need and march ahead or start thinking about a career
change. I don't see much in between.''

Relief in Sight?
   Technology will come to the rescue eventually, as it has so many times
before. Developments such as true plug-and-play network components and
mature directory services that have been integrated with E-mail and other
applications will help enormously. Technology will be used to tame
technology. And, with time at such a premium, products that are easiest to
use--not fastest or cheapest--will win.
   Meanwhile, networks have to be managed and a combination of teamwork
with the right leadership is critical. One way to deal with the
contradictory needs for specialization and broad knowledge is informal
cross-training. With this strategy, different groups of specialists can
take turns educating everyone else about a particular area of technology at
monthly staff meetings.
   Above all, LAN managers need to keep the application of technology in
perspective.
   ``Your company is best served if you concentrate on interpreting its
business needs and putting to use the infrastructure you already have in
place,'' Kozikowski said. Upgrade pressure differs from industry to
industry, but even the network professionals in IS-intensive businesses
need to filter out a lot of noise.
   Outside of science fiction, technology won't really take over because it
can't sustain itself. But it will bury individuals who can't ignore all the
hype about the latest and greatest and focus instead on the new
developments that must be mastered. The ability to make this distinction is
the single greatest skill that today's LAN managers can have.

THE LAN MANAGER EVOLUTION

By:
Susan Breidenbach

   A day in the life of the typical LAN manager is quite different today
than it was when LAN Times was first published almost a dozen years ago.
The job's scope and complexity have increased enormously along with the
importance of the LAN platform itself in the corporate IS hierarchy.
   This trend is becoming even more marked as a number of key
elements--extremely robust client and server platforms, distributed
databases, directory services, high-bandwidth networks, telephony, new WAN
services, maturing middleware, and better development tools--all come
together. Driven by these factors, the PC LAN is increasingly hosting
mission-critical applications, not just connecting users to them.
   As one of our Reader Advisory Board members said recently, LAN managers
today are coping with ``a whole different ball of wax'' (see ``The Changing
Role of the LAN Manager,'' Page 48).
   And as the LAN manager's role changes, so does the type of person
filling that role.
   The original network and systems professionals were technoids who rarely
ventured outside their own domain. Most lacked the people skills they
needed when the PC revolution suddenly turned their users into computer
operators. But technology saved the day when better interfaces--menuing
systems and then GUIs--enabled the development of products that could be
used by people who didn't know assembly language.
   The new wave of network professionals included the pioneers who
installed and managed the first PC LANs in the early 1980s. They were an
eclectic bunch--shoe salesmen, office managers, auto mechanics, and even
lawyers wanting to make an honest living--who bootstrapped their way up,
learning as they went. And, of course, there's the LAN manager who was the
person sitting closest to the printer when the organization decided to
install a network for sharing it. Anyway, they were looking for a new
challenge, or at least for a more accessible information system, and this
nascent technology looked promising.
   Today, rookie LAN technicians tend to have a computer science or IS
background, and in a way, that's unfortunate. They seem more apt to be
interested in technology for technology's sake rather than as a solution to
a business problem. The shoe salesmen and office managers brought a
real-world perspective to the job that may be missing now.
   ``Today, we get computer-science types who learn how things operate at
one point in time and think that knowledge will carry them for the next 20
years,'' said Patrick Corrigan, managing director of The Corrigan Group in
Portland, Ore. ``I think we'll see a lot less innovation and less ability
to see through vendor hype.''
   This new generation of LAN managers may also have less ability to home
in on the root of the problem during trouble-shooting. About 15 years ago,
the dean of my university's engineering school lamented the effect that
calculators were having on the mental-arithmetic skills of engineering
students. ``They are losing the ability to `guesstimate,' a skill that is
very important in the design and planning process,'' he said.
   Similarly, while the original LAN managers learned networking through
hands-on experience, the new breed is more likely to be separated from the
network by textbook theory and layer upon layer of GUI interfaces and other
tools. They lack the intuition that comes from years of direct contact with
the basic network technology that is so critical to diagnostics.
   In these circumstances, one would expect technical wizards with good
diagnostic skills to be at a premium. However, vendor claims about
plug-and-play interoperability, management tools, and self-healing networks
often have nontechnical executives thinking that these skills are of
decreasing value.
   Today, some network administration tasks can indeed be automated, or at
least handled by a quasi-technical staff equipped with the right tools. But
the ultimate responsibility for the network needs to rest in the hands of
people who have a real-world perspective and a complete understanding of
networking technology.
   Some of the original LAN pioneers may, in fact, be out of their depth,
but individuals always fall by the wayside as technology advances--even
those with formal computer-science education. The old guard is a precious
resource that companies need to exploit to the fullest as they take their
networks into the 21st century.

RAID 5 IS AN IDEAL SOLUTION FOR ENTRY-LEVEL STORAGE

By:
Roger Cox

   Today's network administrators are increasingly relying on RAID
solutions to manage their storage. According to a survey conducted by
Peripheral Concepts, a market-research company, RAID use has doubled over
the past two years.
   It's no wonder why: The Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Peripheral Concepts
estimates that the hourly costs of downtime are reaching $20,000 an hour
for a Novell Inc. NetWare installation. There is no need to address the
virtues of fault-tolerant storage. Rather, I will focus on bringing
attention to RAID 5, a superior solution for entry-level fault-tolerant
storage.

5 Alive
   RAID 5, defined as block-level data striping with distributed parity
over a minimum of three drives, offers the best cost/performance for
transaction-oriented networks. In particular, a three-drive RAID 5 storage
solution offers several advantages over such two-drive solutions as NetWare
embedded mirroring: superior storage scaleability, better performance,
richer fault tolerance, and a lower overall price.
   Superior scaleability. The storage requirements of network file servers
are constantly evolving to meet the needs of workgroup expansion and
application complexity. Therefore, the capability to add storage
incrementally--as you need it--is key. With NetWare embedded mirroring, you
must add two drives when you need to increase your storage capacity. Or you
can replace your existing two drives with two new, larger-capacity drives.
Either approach has serious cost implications.
   With RAID 5, on the other hand, you only buy the capacity you need to
meet expanding storage requirements.
   Increased performance. Local-area network administrators are constantly
looking for ways to increase performance. Today's top-performing file
servers require high performance I/O, which translates to faster SCSI disk
drives, faster spindle revolutions-per-minute read and write rates, and
lower access times.
   To determine the performance relationship of a two-drive
NetWare-embedded mirroring configuration to a three-drive RAID 5
configuration, Adaptec Inc. ran a series of standard tests in its
performance-analysis lab. Using a three-drive RAID 5 configuration proved
to be 28 percent faster than the two-drive NetWare embedded-mirroring
configuration. Moreover, reconstructing a failed drive in the three-drive
RAID 5 configuration was 60 percent faster than NetWare embedded mirroring.
(Benchmark reports are available directly from Adaptec).

   Far richer fault tolerance. In addition to providing better performance,
increased partition capacity, and protection against data loss, a prime
mission of any fault-tolerant storage solution is to eliminate server
interruption caused by a failed drive. By providing such capabilities as
hot-spare, warm-swap, and hot-swap drive support, contemporary RAID 5
adapters allow for real-time data recovery without having to restore an
entire database.
   Hot-spare drive support enables you to automatically reconstruct data
without user intervention. Warm-swap drive support lets the user pause
activity on the SCSI bus while you replace a failed drive. Hot-swap drive
support lets you replace a failed drive without having to interrupt server
activity. (When shopping for a RAID 5 solution, remember to keep in mind
that hot-swap drive support must be supported by the drive enclosure.)
   Lower price. Recent reductions in the cost of storage peripherals and
adapters have made RAID 5 a viable and popular alternative to NetWare
embedded mirroring. As network storage requirements increase and storage
capacity must be added, the cost advantage of RAID 5 becomes very
favorable. With RAID 5, you purchase additional drives one at a time. This
advantage is important for two reasons: First, you minimize your storage
expansion cost, and second, because the cost per megabyte of storage is
constantly falling, every megabyte of disk storage you can put off buying
until the future will cost less.
   RAID 5 is an essential, cost-effective solution for today's
business-critical networks. When evaluating your storage needs, it is
important to consider cost, price/performance, scaleability, and the type
of fault-tolerant storage requirements needed to support your network
users.

THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
Now that you've told us what you want in a network-management package, the
LAN Times Testing Center shows you where to find it

By:
Reggie Lisle

   Not long ago, a crescent wrench, a socket set, and a Saturday afternoon
were about all you needed to work on the family wagon. But now that it
seems you need specialized gear just to change the oil, your trusty toolbox
isn't the help it used to be. It's the same with network management.
Veteran administrators remember the days when management tools could fit on
a few floppy disks. Now, the utilities that ship with a NOS, although fine
for certain tasks, won't take you very far. It won't be long before you're
searching in vain for the right tool for the job.
   If you're looking to add to your tool chest, there are a number of
options, and the LAN Times Testing Center takes a look at four leading
network-administration suites in this issue. In some cases, we had to look
at a company's entire product line because of the modular approach of their
utilities. We evaluated Seagate Enterprise Management Software's Seagate
Frye Utilities for Networks, Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01,
McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation 5.5, and Symantec Corp.'s
Norton Network Series 2.0.
   (Because of recent acquisitions, both the Seagate and McAfee product
lines are in transition. Seagate Enterprise Management Software, a division
of Seagate Technology Inc., is a joining of Frye Computer Systems Inc.,
NetLabs Inc., and Network Computing Inc. Most of the modules reviewed in
this comparison were formerly part of Frye's management suite. McAfee,
meanwhile, plans to rename its network-management strategy McAfee Systems
Management sometime this year. For the sake of clarity, we will refer to
Seagate's product line as Seagate Frye Utilities and McAfee's product line
as Saber LAN Workstation throughout the comparison.)
The products we tested deal with both desktop and LAN management, but we
chose to lump all of them under the moniker network administration. After
all, it is becoming more difficult to determine where the desktop ends and
the network begins.

Your Call
   To find out which management features were most important to you, we
conducted a phone survey of some LAN Times readers. This survey was
conducted by the Testing Center independently of the larger study referred
to elsewhere in this issue, but the results were similar. We asked network
managers what tasks were crucial for administering their networks and what
kinds of utilities they needed that don't ship with their network software.
The three most important tasks were asset management, license metering, and
software distribution; server monitoring and suite integration were deemed
slightly less important. These five tasks, along with a miscellaneous
classification that includes remote-control and anti-virus capabilities,
were the criteria on which we based our testing.

How Not to Make a Network Quilt
   End-to-end management of a network is like a bad patchwork quilt:
Components from different vendors are roughly stitched together--and the
seams don't always hold. Corporate networks usually boast several
generations of PCs, and they grow haphazardly rather than according to an
overall strategy. Some companies have three different support staffs just
to keep their patchwork running: One to manage the wiring and phone
systems, one to administer the servers, and one to take care of user
requests. Vendors, the consummate promisers, continue to claim that as soon
as some standard becomes well-established, this network quilt will
transform itself into something resembling your grandmother's afghan with
its smoothly interlocking pieces. Still, no single tool has emerged that
can handle an entire enterprise. Even large systems-management packages
such as Hewlett-Packard Co. HP OpenView or IBM NetView still require
different consoles and management utilities to fully control the network.

Boon or Bane?
   Standards can serve as stumbling blocks or as an impetus to needed
change. One promising standard, SNMP, provides control over compliant
devices such as hubs, routers, and UPSes (uninterruptible power supplies).
However, SNMP's coverage is spotty, and its implementation can be a bit
confusing.
   The Desktop Management Interface (DMI) specification, developed by a
group of vendors spearheaded by Intel Corp. and called the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF), also holds promise. However, of the products
we tested, only Intel's LANDesk adheres to the DMI. The DMI specification
was published about three years ago and is a potentially elegant solution
to the expensive problem of managing desktop PCs and other network devices.
It was designed as a way to gather meaningful information from the
thousands of desktops scattered across corporate LANs and WANs.
   Unfortunately, it lacked a vital component: a way to pass collected data
across the network. With the recent announcement of the Remote Desktop
Management Interface (RDMI), however, that problem will soon be solved.
Vendors predict they will begin adhering to the RDMI standard within 12 to
18 months. Of course, we've heard promises before.
   DMI-enabled applications may still conquer the desktop, but the
specification's fate will likely be decided by Microsoft Corp. The software
giant is wavering in its support of DMI--perhaps until it can come out with
something more in its favor. Naturally, the company with the biggest say in
what happens to the desktop can afford to watch from the sidelines for a
while. Microsoft Windows 95, for instance, has some desktop-management
features built in, but it is not yet DMI-compliant.
   We recommend that you continue to use your current
systems-administration tools to manage an imminent Windows 95 rollout. Of
the vendors in this comparison, only Symantec has released products that
are Windows 95 and 32-bit certified: Norton Utilities for Networks, Norton
Anti-Virus, and Norton pcANYWHERE. Within six months, expect the release of
additional Symantec products and offerings from the other vendors that take
advantage of Windows 95's management hooks. If you plan to stick with
Windows 3.x for a while, these four products currently shipping, although
far from perfect, should help you get a better handle on your network.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

   For this special issue of LAN Times, the Testing Center takes a look at
four leading network-administration packages: Seagate Enterprise Management
Software's Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks, Intel Corp.'s LANDesk
Management Suite 2.01, McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation 5.5,
and Symantec Corp.'s Norton Network Series 2.0. Our evaluation was based on
criteria deemed most important by a sample of LAN Times readers: asset
management, license metering, software distribution, server monitoring, and
suite integration. We added a miscellaneous criterion for capabilities that
did not fit neatly into the other five categories. Three of these four
companies offer a collection of multiple products (or modules) to meet
these management needs, with varying degrees of communication between the
parts. Intel was the only company that offered a tightly integrated
solution.
   Although Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks is a modular suite, the
company has put a lot of effort into integration. In addition to the
suite's common management console, many of the modules can share data. We
gave the product high marks for server monitoring but only an average score
for the license-metering utility.
   LANDesk was the best overall network-management solution; it won the
comparison and just missed getting a Best of Times award. LANDesk now
supports NDS (NetWare Directory Services), and we liked its server
monitoring and software distribution. However, we wish we could have
exported data from the inventory utility to the license-metering module.
   After the company's acquisition of Saber Software Corp. last fall,
McAfee's network-administration tools are in a period of transition.
Although all the modules scored well, we wish integration was a little
stronger.
   Symantec has put a lot of effort into the Norton Network Series, which
encompasses a range of top-of-the-line products. We especially liked the
asset-management module in Norton Administrator for Networks.
Unfortunately, the package lacked a server-monitoring tool, which
dramatically affected its overall score. With an adequate server-monitoring
feature, Norton Network Series could have scored as high as any of the
other products in the comparison.

WHAT WILL ALL THAT DEALING MEAN?

   Mergers and acquisitions among companies that produce network-management
software have been fast and furious in the past six months. If you've tried
to keep track, you may have found it simpler to count the companies not
involved in some sort of maneuvering. Indeed, all of the software makers in
this comparison, except for Intel Corp., have recently made changes to
their product lines due in part to changes in their corporate composition.
   By purchasing Frye Computer Systems Inc. last August, Seagate Technology
Inc. acquired the popular Frye Utilities, distributed now by Seagate's
Enterprise Management Software division. In the longer term, Seagate is
developing an end-to-end network- and systems-management package that will
integrate the Frye Utilities with technologies and products from other
acquisitions such as Arcada Software Inc. and Palindrome Corp.
   Seagate is aiming to produce management and backup tools for Novell Inc.
NetWare, Microsoft Windows NT, and Unix platforms, as well as developing a
32-bit version of Frye Utilities. This edition will take advantage of the
Windows 95 architecture and should be available by the middle of this
year.
   McAfee Associates Inc., which recently purchased Saber Software Corp.,
has an ambitious plan to create a series of enterprise-management products
for NetWare and Windows NT, called McAfee Systems Management. Although the
strategy is not surprising, the speed at which the company hopes to meet
these goals is. This year, McAfee plans to release 13 major products that
run on Windows 95, are SNMP-compliant, have TCP/IP support, share a common
OLE management console and scripting language, and are scaleable.
   Symantec Corp. recently finalized its purchase of Delrina Corp., which
followed a long line of acquisitions. Symantec was one of the first vendors
to offer 32-bit programs for Windows 95, such as its Norton Utilities, and
the company will be releasing most of its product line for Windows 95
sometime this year.

NOT READY TO RUMBLE

   Some people view Novell Inc.'s ManageWise and Microsoft Corp.'s Systems
Management Server as two heavyweights trading blows in the
network-management arena. Unfortunately, they're more like fighters who
never face each other in the ring because they work for different
promoters.
   The LAN Times Testing Center has received numerous requests to compare
the two products, but so far there hasn't been much to compare. There are a
few similarities: Both Systems Management Server (SMS) and the LANDesk
portion of ManageWise perform software distribution, for instance. But the
differences far outweigh the similarities.
   A very powerful package with many wide-area capabilities, ManageWise 2.0
combines Novell's LANalyzer 1.0 and NMS (NetWare Management System) 2.0
with Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Manager 1.51. It is designed for multiserver
NetWare environments in which the need to control non-PC, SNMP-compatible
devices such as routers, hubs, and UPSes (uninterruptible power supplies)
is critical. ManageWise's strength is its openness, and Novell encourages
independent software vendors (ISVs) to write software that takes advantage
of its services. In fact, Novell offers a 120-page list of compatible
products.
   Systems Management Server 1.1 runs on Microsoft Windows NT and is part
of the Microsoft BackOffice suite. It also requires Microsoft SQL Server,
another component of BackOffice. SMS offers robust remote-control and
traffic-monitoring capabilities, as well as an excellent
software-distribution utility with an integrated inventory database. Its
strengths are an easy-to-use GUI and good integration of the different
features. Microsoft also encourages ISVs to write software that takes
advantage of SMS' services.
   The bottom line? We will compare the two products only when ManageWise
can manage Windows NT or SMS can manage NetWare. Until then, neither can
legitimately claim the championship belt.

SURVEY OF READERS DETERMINES CRITERIA

   Although the feature sets of the four product lines overlap in several
areas, each network-management package has certain capabilities that the
others do not. Because we wanted an apples-to-apples comparison, we
telephoned a number of LAN Times readers to determine the areas they
considered most significant when evaluating a network-administration
product. In order of importance, they were asset management, license
metering, software distribution, server monitoring, and integration. A
miscellaneous category was created as a catchall for features we thought
worthy of mention but that did not fit neatly in our test criteria.
   We used three servers and 12 workstations to perform our testing. A
Compaq Computer Corp. ProSignia 486/66 with 32MB of RAM ran Novell Inc.
NetWare 3.12; a Hewlett-Packard Co. NetServer LM 486/66 with 24MB of RAM
and the latest copy of Microsoft Corp.'s File and Print Services for
NetWare ran Microsoft Windows NT 3.51; and an HP Vectra 486/33 with 24MB of
RAM ran NetWare 4.1. We used 12 HP Vectra 486/33s with 8MB of RAM for the
clients: Three ran Microsoft DOS 6.22, eight ran Windows 3.1, and one (with
16MB of RAM) ran Windows 95. Although 32-bit editions of these programs
will not be released until later this year, the 16-bit versions operated on
the Microsoft Windows 95 workstation without any obvious problems.
   We installed each suite or group of products on the NetWare 4.1 server
and then on the NetWare 3.12 server. Those products that supported Windows
NT were installed on the NT server. They were then evaluated according to
the following criteria.

Management Material
   The LAN Times readers we surveyed deemed asset management, license
metering, and software distribution the most important capabilities in an
administration tool, and we gave these criteria higher weighting in our
scoring. The main goal of asset management is simple: Find out what
hardware and software exist on your enterprise. Thus, we looked for the
capability to detect resources on both servers and workstations.
   We also wanted to see whether workstation audits were performed by login
script or batch file. We checked for Desktop Management Interface (DMI)
compliance by using various Management Information Formats (MIFs). For
license metering, we checked to see if the packages supported network and
local drives, multiple servers, applications suites, and remote checkout.
   To test software distribution, we performed a standard battery of tests,
including installing the Microsoft Office suite in a number of ways. First,
we loaded the suite from the workstation running each product's management
console, then from a local server on the same segment as the workstations,
and finally from a remote server across a router.
   We weighted server monitoring and product integration slightly lower
than the first three criteria. Even though there are hundreds of possible
server statistics, we looked for the most common and useful ones, such as
current connections, disk and volume information, and memory utilization.
For integration, we looked specifically at links between the
asset-management and software-metering modules, as well as how they
integrated with a common management console. And as previously mentioned,
we added a miscellaneous category for unique features that did not fit the
other criteria.
   Finally, we kept useability in mind throughout the testing process,
although it didn't get its own criterion. All of these products are
supposed to make the administrator's job easier. If a tool's learning curve
is too high, then you may not be getting your money's worth.

TAKING STOCK OF EVERYTHING

   Asset management is one of the biggest areas of concern for LAN
administrators. Without a good asset-management strategy, important
questions such as ``Are we using all the software we've bought over the
past year?'' and ``What hardware do we have, and where is it?'' cannot be
readily answered. Utilities that perform hardware and software inventories
are not a panacea, but they are an immense help in tracking what's on the
LAN.
   As we tested the inventorying functions of the four products, we
repeatedly encountered a particular error. Although the utilities were
capable of finding everything on our test network, they often made mistakes
in reporting the processor speed of some machines. Everything else worked
well, however, and we gave good marks across the board--with Symantec
Corp.'s tool receiving the highest score.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   LAN Directory (LAND) is the Seagate module that performs hardware and
software inventories. This utility was very easy to install, and we were
inventorying workstations in short order. LAND correctly identified all our
workstations and the applications loaded on them thanks to its built-in
list of 6,000 software titles. In addition to its basic capabilities, LAND
can track inventory history and noncomputer equipment.
   Although LAND makes it easy to scan individual user records, the syntax
of its report writer is not easy to understand. If you need more
information than the two dozen canned reports provide, you will be better
off modifying one of the samples rather than creating a new one from
scratch.
   WinLAND is the recently released edition of LAND for Windows 3.1. It
ships with a version of the Watcom International Corp. Watcom SQL database,
which enables more ad hoc queries to be performed from a third-party
program.

LANDesk
   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk is tied tightly to Novell Inc. NetWare. Its
hardware and software inventory functions are placed in a NetWare login
script and can be set to execute every time a user logs in to the server or
at other predefined intervals. You can also set up the server to
continuously scan for new software. Viewing inventory information is easy.
A number of canned reports are available, or you can customize them with
user-defineable data such as serial numbers and installation date.
   Because of its close ties to Novell's NMS (NetWare Management System),
LANDesk can inventory SNMP-capable devices. Discovered workstations and
devices are managed by a utility similar to the Microsoft Windows File
Manager. Individual workstations can be identified by a unique name, the
hardware address of the network card, or the last user to log in at that
station. LANDesk was the only Desktop Management Interface (DMI)-compliant
product that we tested.

Saber LAN Workstation
   Although Saber Software Corp.'s Saber LAN Workstation (SLW) 5.0 had an
adequate inventory tool, it was considered weak compared with McAfee
Associates Inc.'s LAN Inventory, a part of BrightWorks 2.1. McAfee's
acquisition of Saber has left the asset-management part of SLW 5.0 out in
the cold for now. In SLW 5.5, most of the old BrightWorks utilities have
replaced Saber's tools.
   LAN Inventory is demanding; it needs seven NLMs on the file server and a
TSR on each workstation. (The TSR is a Btrieve Technology Inc. Btrieve
requester that will no longer be needed when McAfee converts to a Microsoft
FoxPro database scheme.) We thought the product performed an adequate, but
not stellar, job of gathering inventory information from our workstations.
BrightWorks currently supports Compaq Computer Corp.'s Intelligent
Manageability firmware, which is very similar to the DMI specification.

Norton Network Series
   With its built-in list of thousands of software packages, Symantec's
Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) 2.0 accurately identified the
applications on our test system, but if an application you use is not on
the list, you can add it. And it took just a few mouse clicks to generate a
comprehensive report about our workstations.
   Starting with a scan of the system BIOS, NAN delivers a level of detail
in its hardware inventory matched only by Frye's LAN Directory. Both DOS
and Windows versions are available, although the Windows version provides
more information about Windows drivers and statistics. Last but not least,
NAN lets an administrator run the inventory program from a floppy disk on a
standalone computer and then merge collected data into the master database
when convenient.

NOT JUST FOR METERING ANYMORE

   Application license metering isn't the hot new technology it was several
years ago. Now, it's almost a necessity. Increased vigilance by the
Software Publishers Association and the Business Software Alliance has sent
a stern message to pirates: Comply or else. However, savvy managers have
found an additional benefit to the tools they first used to get
legal--allocating and managing existing licenses to reduce the number of
new licenses they are forced to buy.
   Last summer, we reviewed eight metering tools, including the four that
are part of the network-management packages in this comparison (see
``Software-Metering Tools,'' July 3, 1995, Page 65, and ``Another Look at
Software-Metering Tools,'' July 24, 1995, Page 101). Then, as now, we were
more interested in license management than in simple license metering.
McAfee Associates Inc.'s SiteMeter earned a Best of Times last summer, and
it received the top score in this comparison.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Software Metering And Resource Tracking (SMART) is Seagate's
license-metering module. A Microsoft Windows version isn't available, but
the DOS interface is fairly easy to use. SMART is an NLM-based product and
uses a TSR to monitor clients. It can monitor single-user, concurrent, and
suite licenses on both local and network drives. SMART identifies files to
meter only by filename or path information; it can't use other identifiers
such as file size and date.
   When license limits are reached, SMART can passively monitor the
situation, keeping a log for the administrator, or it can actively prevent
applications from being used until a license is available. Overall, if
you're looking for an effective metering tool and don't need to manage
licenses, then SMART deserves a closer look.

LANDesk
   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite offers an NLM-based metering
solution that provides a good way to manage licenses across multiple
servers. Several NLMs access the metering database, transfer access and
metering information between workstations and servers, and scan for file
opens and closes.
   In a typical multiserver environment, a management server contains the
primary metering databases and a relay server stores copies of
applications. When a user loads a metered application, only eight packets
pass among the workstation, relay server, and management server. This
reduces the amount of interserver chatter so effectively that LANDesk can
operate adequately over a 56KB per second WAN link. LANDesk uses path
information to identify executeable files (including applications suites)
on Novell Inc. NetWare file servers, but it can't monitor local hard drives
or servers based on other platforms.

Saber LAN Workstation
   The license-metering product for the previous version of Saber LAN
Workstation was known as Saber Enterprise Application Manager (SEAM). After
McAfee's acquisition of Saber, however, SEAM has been scrapped in favor of
McAfee's own SiteMeter 5.1, which McAfee acquired when it purchased
Brightwork Development Inc.
   As an NLM-based product, SiteMeter requires NetWare 3.1 or higher. It
tracks applications by monitoring file opens and closes on the server. It
also offers TCP/IP support with license load balancing, which reduces WAN
traffic by allowing SiteMeter to automatically migrate licenses to the
server from which they are most commonly requested. Unlike most other
NLM-based metering products, SiteMeter doesn't ship with a TSR for
monitoring local hard drives, an option we think most administrators would
prefer to have.
   An administrator can gather license statistics--in real time or over a
specified period--on all metered servers on the internetwork. Seagate
Technology Inc.'s Crystal Reports Microsoft Windows-based software is
included with SiteMeter for generating reports.
   Installation is easy, but you will need to have the latest versions of
CLIB.NLM and BTRIEVE.NLM on your file server. Once you configure one file
server with license and permission information, you can use the
license-replication feature to copy the information to other servers, which
is a real time-saver.

Norton Network Series
   Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) includes the software-metering
portion of the Norton Network Series. It is a client-based product that
uses DOS and Windows TSRs (Symantec Corp. calls them Agents) along with an
administrative program to monitor and enforce license limits. The product
can meter concurrent, server, and site licenses on network and local
drives.
   Installation can be time-consuming because an Agent must be running on
each workstation to be monitored. However, NAN's software-distribution
feature can be used to ease this chore, loading the Agents when users log
in to the network.
   Because NAN links its asset-management and metering pieces, it is easy
to create a list of the applications on your network to be monitored. In
addition, NAN includes over 5,000 predefined applications; if a program is
not on the list, you can add a description to the database. Our one
complaint in this regard was that the list of metered applications must be
manually copied to other servers. However, data from all of the servers can
be combined into a single report.

LET THE SUITE DO THE WALKING

   Visiting every workstation on the network to install the latest software
upgrade is one of the most tedious, time-consuming jobs a manager is
responsible for. That's why software distribution over the LAN is one of
the best ideas ever developed for network administration. Intel Corp.'s
LANDesk won this portion of our comparison, with its innovative, yet
easy-to-use, tool.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate's software-distribution module is called Software Update and
Distribution System (SUDS), and we liked it almost as much as LANDesk's
tool. Some of the common tasks that can be performed are searching and
replacing in text files, finding duplicate files on workstations, and
uninstalling packages. It also has a scheduler that lets file distribution
be run after business hours. This feature requires that a TSR run on the
target workstation.
   Seagate offers single-server, server-to-server, and WAN versions of
SUDS. The server-to-server option is useful for updating NLMs and other
files between servers. This feature is similar to Symantec Corp.'s Norton
Administrator for Networks' Site Manager utility, but it can also schedule
and execute console commands that load and unload NLMs on the target
server. The wide-area option lets an administrator distribute jobs to other
SUDS servers on the WAN. A single copy is sent across the link; the
receiving SUDS server distributes copies to its workstations. This reduces
WAN traffic and is great for slower (dial-up or 56Kbps) connections.

LANDesk
   Intel's software-distribution solution is the easiest we encountered, at
least for networks with standardized workstations. LANDesk uses a
management agent on a reference workstation to track changes to that
client's installed software. When it's time for an upgrade, LANDesk applies
changes made at the reference workstation to all clients on the LAN. Most
other software-distribution packages use server-based rules to upgrade
software.
   There are drawbacks to LANDesk's method, however. If software needs to
be uninstalled, LANDesk will restore .INI files to the state they were in
before installation. On the surface this seems good, but it could cause
problems if something else has been installed since the last LANDesk
distribution job.
   There are several ways to choose recipients of a distribution job. You
could query the hardware-inventory database and then specify only the
machines with a certain minimum configuration.
   Like the other packages in this comparison, a job can be performed even
if users have logged off, although their network drivers must still be
loaded. And like SUDS, LANDesk is able to work efficiently over the WAN.
Each local server is responsible for distributing software to its
workstations.

Saber LAN Workstation
   The program that handles software distribution for McAfee Associates
Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation (SLW) 5.5 was formerly known as SiteExpress
3.0 when it was part of the BrightWorks package. Like most of McAfee's
current product line, this program is targeted at Novell Inc. NetWare 3.x
and 4.x networks with DOS and Microsoft Windows workstations. It performs
standard distribution jobs well, and workstation distribution can be
scheduled to occur at login or logout. The product relies heavily on a
Microsoft Visual Basic-like scripting language that administrators may not
want to take the time to learn, although it is powerful and relatively easy
to use.
   The SLW 5.5 utility supports TCP/IP, which lets administrators
distribute software to remote IP servers that are not part of the local IPX
network. And thanks to NDS (NetWare Directory Services) support, software
can be distributed to NDS tree objects. In our testing, we created an NDS
user object on our NetWare 4.1 server and used this tool to send a simple
distribution job.
   Because distribution jobs usually create a high amount of network
traffic, the SLW 5.5 utility can compress the files it moves. However, we
didn't notice much of a difference on our relatively small test network. On
much larger distribution jobs, compression could make a substantial
difference.

Norton Network Series
   Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) delivers a decent implementation
of software distribution. Although creating distribution jobs is harder
than it is with the other packages in this comparison, the distribution
phase is the fastest and most trouble-free of the quartet.
   Like SLW 5.5, NAN relies heavily on a scripting language, in this case
Symantec's version of BASIC, and the company has included a number of
sample scripts. NAN can even record keystrokes for fast customization of
jobs. If you use the scripts provided, you should not expect any problems.
   We experienced difficulties, however, when we tried to create custom
scripts without consulting the manual. Fairly complex jobs can be created
if you're willing to spend the time, but the process isn't easy. We also
think it's wise to test any procedure before scheduling a job on the
network.

PREVENTIVE ADMINISTRATION

   Most servers are either tucked away in some nook or cranny or secreted
in closets and locked rooms. Unfortunately, this arrangement promotes an
out-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude. When a server exhibits a problem, the
first sign an administrator often has is a slew of phone calls from frantic
users. With the server-monitoring feature of a network-management package,
however, an administrator can monitor a server's health, often heading off
problems before they occur.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate has a number of packages for server monitoring. Taken as a
whole, this set tops even Intel Corp.'s LANDesk. Unfortunately, by having
to buy separate products, you'll pay a quite bit more for the combined
functionality than you will for the other suites in this comparison.
   Network Management for NetWare is a DOS-based module that can take the
place of native Novell Inc. NetWare utilities such as SYSCON, PCONSOLE,
FCONSOLE, and FILER. If you spend a lot of time switching between these
utilities, Network Management for NetWare is well worth the cost. We used
it to add and delete users, set up print queues, monitor user connections,
and identify old NETX.EXE shell versions.
   Early Warning System for NetWare is an NLM-based module that monitors
server events and can respond in a number of customizeable ways. Early
Warning System can alert administrators via pager, fax, or E-mail of
critical problems, or it can run an automated procedure for less crucial
events. This module integrates with Seagate's license-metering module to
alert administrators when a license limit has been exceeded.
   Console Commander for NetWare is essentially a scheduler that executes
scripts at a predetermined time. We used it to unload and load a series of
NLMs on our NetWare servers. It is a capable, but bare-bones, utility.

LANDesk
   Intel's offering has some very comprehensive server-monitoring
functions, and its object-tree structure makes operation easy. When you
select a server object from the tree, a list of applicable management
options appear. Intel has added over 100 new monitoring parameters to this
version of LANDesk. Again, they are presented as a collapsible tree that
makes it easy to view information and set alarm thresholds.
   The new alert manager, Alert Management System, can receive alerts from
the other LANDesk modules. It also lets you execute predefined tasks in
response to an alert, similar to Frye's NEWS. Network administrators can be
notified via E-mail or pager.
   LANDesk includes a substitute for Novell's RCONSOLE.NLM to remotely
control the server's console screen from a workstation. The difference
between them is RCONSOLE uses a text password stored on the server, but
LANDesk encrypts the password.

SLW
   The Saber LAN Workstation line from McAfee Associates Inc. has some good
server-monitoring tools from Brightwork Development Inc. These utilities
will be upgraded and repackaged into the Server Manager, which should be
available by the middle of the year. Because we don't know exactly what
Server Manager will look like, we evaluated HawkNet Inc.'s NetTune Pro, a
utility bundled with BrightWorks.
   NetTune can monitor nearly all of NetWare's configureable settings. It
also can determine if current settings are causing problems and can suggest
a solution, which it can institute automatically. However, NetTune doesn't
provide any network traffic statistics like Frye's or Intel's products do.

Norton Network Series
   The Norton Network Series does not offer any server-monitoring features
as we define them, which really hurt its final score. If Symantec Corp.
adds some server-monitoring capabilities, the Norton Network Series,
already an excellent all-around package, might surpass even Intel's LANDesk
suite.

PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER

   Three of the product lines we looked at--Seagate Enterprise Management
Software's Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks, McAfee Associates Inc.'s
Saber LAN Workstation, and Symantec Corp.'s Norton Network Series--are
loosely integrated sets of modules with a common management console.
Applications are loaded from the console as needed by the administrator.
Although these products started as standalone tools, their developers have
made impressive strides toward tying them together. The module approach
works well because you can add management tools as your network grows.
   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01, on the other hand, is a
tightly integrated one-stop package. Communications between the
asset-management and network-monitoring portions are excellent, for
instance. LANDesk would have easily won this portion of the comparison if
its software-inventory and -metering functions had been linked.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate's modular approach made installation a little tiring; we
couldn't help but wonder if there were a better way after loading the ninth
or 10th separate piece. We hope a CD-ROM installation will be available
soon. After installation, however, we had very few complaints. All the
programs detected the presence of previously installed modules and plugged
themselves in to the shared management console. Also, all of the modules
have some data-sharing capabilities. For example, the inventory module, LAN
Directory, shares its asset database with the software-distribution
module.
   Most of the modules can also make use of the scheduling capability of
network-alert tools. We were also able to examine user connections logged
in to the server and then launch the inventory program to access more
detailed information.
   Seagate has done a pretty good job of integrating its software. The next
big hurdle for the company will be tying together software from all the
rest of its recent acquisitions.

LANDesk
   As previously mentioned, LANDesk is a tightly integrated package. The
new version includes a centralized Alert Management System that can receive
alerts from the other LANDesk modules. Also, if an alert is generated, a
predefined task can be run in response. LANDesk has a terrific report
generator that all of the management tools can directly send information
to. On the downside, the software-metering module can't import information
from the inventory database, a glaring shortcoming, and something we'd like
to see remedied in the future.

Saber LAN Workstation
   Given the recent structural changes at McAfee, it's difficult to speak
definitively about the integration of the company's product line.
Communications between SiteExpress and SiteMeter were adequate, but other
integration, specifically between SiteExpress and the desktop-menuing
portion of Saber LAN Workstation (SLW), could have been better. Of course,
these products are in transition and promise to be much more integrated in
the future (see ``What Will All That Dealing Mean?'' above).

Norton Network Series
   The latest version of Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) has added
some centralized features that make it very easy to gather information. NAN
uses a primary/secondary hierarchy in which the primary level consists of
servers and the secondary level consists of associated servers and
workstations. NAN's Site Manager receives information from the secondary
sites and makes sure that the master databases on the primary servers are
updated. These databases can include inventory, distribution, and metering
data.
   A centralized database lets an administrator at a primary server access
information from across the network. This data can be exported to the
report generator or to an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)-compliant
application such as a document manager.
   Although NAN offers strong integration, there are gaps in other products
in the Norton Network Series. Some, for instance, will install themselves
into the common console but can't share databases. In particular, we'd like
to see better integration between the backup and inventory programs.

administrators customize the inventory database among many fields.

HOW DO THEY DIFFER?

   Although there are similarities in the feature sets of these
network-management products, each has important capabilities that don't fit
precisely into the five criteria we've used to analyze them. Some companies
include unique features to differentiate their offerings from the crowd;
others have strengths in related product classes that can add value to
their basic management tools. In a comparison with such a broad focus as
network management, we decided to include a miscellaneous category for just
such extras, although we could not test all of the products mentioned
here.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate offers a number of valuable extras, including the Node Tracker
and the Alert Interface Manager for NMS (NetWare Management System). Node
Tracker can monitor workstation statistics such as IPX components and
network shell version number.
   Node mapping, however, is its most important feature. Not to be confused
with network-mapping utilities, such as Microsystems Engineering Co.'s
SysDraw, which create a graphical representation of the devices on your
network, node mapping collects information on attached workstations as the
machines log in. Because Node Tracker can share this information with LAN
Directory, you could pull up a detailed hardware inventory for a
workstation broadcasting bad packets, for instance. This would make
replacing an ailing NIC much easier. Node Tracker can also share data with
NMS.
   The add-on Alert Interface Manager for NMS increases NMS' capability to
send alerts via pager, E-mail, or Novell Inc. NetWare console message when
NMS generates an alarm or event.

LANDesk
   In addition to its strong core functions, LANDesk includes several
miscellaneous goodies, such as a limited version of Virus Protect, Intel
Corp.'s anti-virus software. The LANDesk packet-analyzer software is
another extra. With it, an administrator can set up filters to monitor data
flow across the wire. In addition to simple packet decodes, LANDesk has
filters that can monitor application traffic. This will let you track a
specific program's impact on your network performance, rooting out the
users and applications that are bandwidth hogs. LANDesk can also monitor
SNMP devices and snap in to some major network-management consoles such as
Novell ManageWise, Hewlett-Packard Co. HP OpenView, and Digital Equipment
Corp. ManageWorks.

Saber LAN Workstation
   McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation has an obvious bonus--the
anti-virus software that made the company famous. The server edition
supports NetWare and Microsoft Windows NT, and the desktop version supports
DOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT. McAfee
also offers a remote-control package called NetRemote. The product handles
the basics well but is not serious competition for Symantec Corp.'s Norton
pcANYWHERE or Microcom Corp.'s Carbon Copy. We successfully used NetRemote
to dial in to a machine and perform minor tasks such as retrieving E-mail.
   With its acquisition of Saber LAN Workstation, McAfee has also gained a
great set of tools for desktop and menu management, capabilities that far
exceed typical software-distribution capabilities. For instance, the
package provides excellent control of .INI, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and CONFIG.SYS
files. However, be prepared to spend some time with the manuals if you want
to use the menu-management features.

Norton Network Series
   Other utilities in the Norton Network Series include pcANYWHERE,
AntiVirus for NetWare, Utilities Administrator, Desktop Administrator, and
Enterprise Backup. All of these products integrate with the Norton
Administrator for Networks console.
   We like pcANYWHERE, the leading remote-control program, so much that we
gave version 2.0 our Best of Times award last spring (see ``pcANYWHERE
Leads Remote-Software Race,'' April 24, 1995, Page 109). Easy integration
with Norton Administrator for Networks is the icing on the cake.
   AntiVirus for NetWare is an NLM-based product that scans for viruses on
your NetWare server. Utilities Administrator adds new life to the venerable
Norton Utilities collection, including the capability to run the utilities
from a centralized console. Desktop Administrator is similar to the
desktop-control portion of Saber LAN Workstation, and we especially liked
that not all users need be under its control. Finally, the powerful Norton
Enterprise Backup offers a many-to-many backup solution.


Illustration(s):
Screen: Intel's LANDesk delivered the easiest software-distribution
solution that we encountered. There are a number of scheduling options, and
jobs can be pushed or pulled out to workstations.

SEAGATE FRYE: UTILITIES FOR NETWORKS

   Seagate Frye Utilities can be installed as a series of individual
products or as modules in a loosely integrated suite, but they are
expensive when purchased separately. The utilities are easy to install, and
most of the modules use a DOS interface, although Seagate is working on
Microsoft Windows 95 versions of the software. The package offers a wide
range of server- and desktop-management functions but lacks anti-virus and
backup utilities. We hope these holes will be filled by Seagate, which
recently acquired the Frye Utilities. In fact, watch for Seagate to release
an end-to-end network-management solution in 1996 composed of Seagate Frye
Utilities, backup utilities from Arcada Software Inc. and Palindrome Corp.,
and Unix-management utilities that Seagate recently acquired.

SABER LAN WORKSTATION 5.5

   Saber LAN Workstation 5.5 is the first in a series of products resulting
from McAfee Associates Inc.'s purchase of Saber Software. This package
combines the asset-management and license-metering capabilities of McAfee's
SiteExpress 3.0 and SiteMeter 5.1 with the desktop-configuration and
-menuing capabilities of SLW 5.0. It also complements McAfee's BrightWorks,
which has strong server-monitoring features. SLW is aimed primarily at
NetWare networks and DOS and Windows workstations. Installation is tricky
in spots, but the products work well once they are loaded. We thought the
integration between utilities in SLW 5.5 needed some work, but we hope this
will be provided in early 1996 with the release of version 6.0. This
product is one to watch as McAfee begins in earnest to consolidate its
acquisitions.

NORTON NETWORK SERIES

   The main products in the NOS-independent Norton Network Series are
Norton Administrator for Networks 2.0, Norton Desktop Administrator 1.0,
Norton Enterprise Backup 1.0, and Norton pcANYWHERE 6.0. Taken together,
these products deliver strong asset-management, license-metering,

LANDESK MANAGEMENT SUITE 2.01

   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01 delivers great functionality
in a tightly integrated package. It won the comparison and just missed
receiving our Best of Times award. In addition to standard
asset-management, software-distribution, and monitoring capabilities,
LANDesk offers SNMP support and low-level packet tracing, features not
found in other products. Installation was easier compared with previous
versions of LANDesk. Also, although this version works only on NetWare
servers, it now supports NDS. A Windows NT version is available, but it

IF WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT, WHY AREN'T WE DEAD YET?

By:
Tere' Parnell

   After a long investigation, you've convinced yourself you need a
desktop-management system and have chosen the one that best meets your
needs. Now comes the really hard part--getting the money to buy it. You
know it will save time, freeing you and your staff to do support work that
now goes undone: reports that aren't run, equipment that isn't inventoried,
and software that isn't upgraded. More than likely, however, conserving
your time isn't a high priority for upper-level management. When you point
to all your neglected tasks, your manager may not understand their
importance. After all, you haven't been doing them, and things seem to be
OK.
   Indeed, one of the desktop-management packages we've reviewed may be
helpful, even vital, to your department--but only if you can get it into
your shop. Given their reluctance to spend money on anything that won't
show a tangible economic benefit, how do you convince the powers-that-be to
give you the money to buy one?
   The answer is deceptively simple: Put a price on it. Determine how much
the system really costs and how much it will really save, or earn, and then
figure out if the difference is worth it. You'll get a lot more attention
when you present a purchase request in terms of the money it can save your
company rather than convenience and ease of use. Telling your boss that a
management system will let you track inventory more easily is one thing;
pointing out that a more accurate inventory will save your company $25,000
a year is another.
   Of course, the nitty-gritty of determining these figures requires
technical expertise, business acumen, and creative thinking. Here are a few
pointers on how to translate benefits and costs into dollars and cents.

It's a Wonderful Life
   The first step to putting a price on the benefit of a management system,
or any technology for that matter, is to take an objective look at life
without the product--past, present, and future. Ask yourself what recent
projects the management system could have streamlined and use these
examples when dealing with management.
   Next, ask yourself what won't get done, or done well, in the future
without the management system and determine how that will affect your
business. For example, if you want to show how valuable software
distribution is, conduct a survey to find out how much time people spend
converting documents and macros between two versions of a word processor
because you haven't had a chance to upgrade everyone's copy.
   As another example, assume that you administer a 2,500-node network and
hope to use the management system to create an accurate inventory of
desktop computer equipment. First, spot check your records, then select a
few dozen entries at random (about a 1 percent sampling rate) and check
their accuracy. Do your current inventory records correctly describe your
desktop systems? Suppose in this example that you find inaccurate
information for four desktop systems, about a 17 percent error rate. The
first system was listed as being in service but was actually broken beyond
repair; the second was listed as being in its third year of service when it
was really in its sixth year; the third was missing a CD-ROM drive your
inventory claimed it had; and the fourth had 8MB more RAM than recorded.
   Your friendly accounting department can help you determine what such an
error rate means in terms of money. An inaccurate inventory of fixed assets
affects depreciation, casualty and theft losses, insurance coverage and
claims, and property tax. In our example, two computers should have been
taken off your books completely, and two computers had the wrong valuation.
In addition, the company may be eligible for an insurance reimbursement for
the missing CD-ROM player.

Doomsayer
   Now that you have a feel for the costs of not having a
desktop-management system, take a moment to play Cassandra. Conjure up the
worst-case scenario that could result from continuing to do without a
management system. In our example, the inaccurate inventory could have
resulted in a massive overpayment of property tax, perhaps $25,000. A hard
number like that is powerful ammunition in your dealings with those who
sign the checks.
   If you're looking for a more extreme example, consider the relatively
new issue of software-license management. Perform an audit of your
department's software usage (the Software Publishers Association provides
utilities for this at URL http://www.spa.org/piracy/download.html). Suppose
you find that your company regularly has 200 copies of a certain word
processor in use, but you only have 150 licenses. The worst-case scenario
might be a visit from the SPA, with federal marshals in tow. Calculate the
cost of settling with the SPA: the full list price for each of the 50
illegal copies and 50 new legal licenses. When you present visions like
these to your managers, you'll definitely have their attention.

Consider the Alternative
   At some point in your pitch, it's a good idea to concede that a complete
management system is not the only way to administer your network. To have a
persuasive argument, you must acknowledge the alternatives, prove that you
have considered them, and then reveal their inadequacies--if you can.
   Alternatives to managing inventory could be to pay overtime or to hire
an additional employee. Naturally, either option costs money. Include
salary, benefits, annual raises, recruiting costs, and turnover in your
calculations. Then estimate the accuracy of that person's work and make
adjustments. Human error is inevitable, and it is expensive. In our earlier
example, hiring someone to manage inventory manually might cost $30,000 per
year but only reduce the error rate to 6 percent; you could still be
overpaying property tax by about $9,000. That translates to a total cost of
$39,000 per year.
   If your primary concern is software distribution, consider the cost of
writing and maintaining your own utilities to manage these chores. Also,
the only real alternative to a license-management program is manual counts.
Again, this means overtime or additional personnel--and a large margin of
error.

The Price Is Right
   Now it's time to put a price on the desktop-management system you want
to buy. Be honest with yourself when calculating these costs. As you know,
the cost is much more than the purchase price. How will the system affect
client and server resources? Will additional hardware be required? Will you
have to purchase annual support contracts? How will implementing the system
affect staffing? Overtime? Training? Don't forget that many of these
packages aren't seamlessly integrated; you may have to spend some time
cobbling together the best combination of tools.
   After you evaluate the costs of the management system, you must assess
its benefits. This is probably where you started, imagining the
improvements such a system would bring to the way you work. But when you're
making your pitch, you'll have to have something more concrete than fuzzy
images of a no-hands network. How will it benefit the company? As mentioned
earlier, making your life easier won't be enough to satisfy the budget
committee. A product that cuts personnel costs or solves a significant
operational or customer-service problem is going to get the budget
dollars.
   In our inventory example, if the total cost of implementing the
management system is $50,000 or less, the system will pay for itself in two
years in property-tax savings alone. After that, the system will be putting
$25,000 back in your company's coffers each year.
   Now that you've gathered your facts, found the costs and shortcomings in
your solution, addressed the holes in your logic, and built a case based on
economic need and common sense, it's time to prepare your presentation.
Start by telling your audience how much the desktop-management system will
save the company. Then give an example of a past project that would have
been done more cost effectively if the system had been in place. Present
the worst-case scenario if the system isn't purchased, and conclude with a
step-by-step explanation of the analysis you used to arrive at these
conclusions. And in case your argument sparks enthusiasm, it's a good idea
to have a detailed implementation plan ready.

You Can't Always Get What You Want
   Your analysis will produce a sound, justifiable, and possibly
unassailable case for purchasing a management system--or a reasonable
explanation of why the purchase isn't feasible. In either case, you win.
Understanding why a purchase doesn't make business sense will build your
credibility with management as much as knowing why it does.
   Just as important, you (and they) will be aware of the types of systems
and pricing that will make sense. If your analysis shows that purchasing a
management system isn't a sound business move, don't give up. Calculate a
price at which the system would be a good buy, then present that figure to
your vendor; be fair--vendors have to make money, too. Even if there isn't
room for negotiation, your vendor will have information for the
management-system developer. Perhaps their system is overpriced for their
target market.
   This exercise will also give you a broad perspective on how your network
fits into your organization. It encourages constant, close communication
with other departments and an understanding of how they use the network and
information about it. This perspective will make you a better network
manager and serve you well throughout your career.

Put a Price on It
   Your boss doesn't want to hear how much easier a network-management
suite will make your job. It's all about the bottom line, and you'll need
to be well-prepared before heading into budget battle. These five steps
will help you attach specific figures to the costs and benefits of a
management package--and get the purchase approved.

Dwell in the Past
   Make a list of projects that could have been streamlined with the proper
tools: Upgrades that could have been rolled out faster, for example. Don't
forget to include IS projects, such as capacity planning or server
optimization, that have been put off for lack of time.

Find the Holes
   Check your current inventory records against a random sample of about 1
percent of your network devices. Document any inconsistencies and have the
accounting department assess the costs of the inaccurate inventory, such as
tax overpayments and neglected insurance claims. Also check for
software-license compliance with one of the utilities provided by the
Software Publishers Association.

It Could Be Worse
   Sketch a worst-case scenario for your boss. Describe what would happen
if your organization was caught illegally using software, for example.

Consider the Alternatives
   Balance your purchase request by calculating the costs of alternatives
to a management suite. Put a dollar value on the expense of adding staff or
paying overtime, for instance.

The Best Policy
   Be honest with your boss--and yourself. Don't gloss over the hidden
outlay associated with the tools you want to buy. Include the costs of
hardware and software upgrades or support contracts. Finally, don't forget
the time it will take you to get up to speed with the tools.
