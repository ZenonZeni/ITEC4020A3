<H1>Finance</H1>
<H2>Int'l LendersRemain Wary of LA Telecom Projects </H2>
<P>Lack of familiarity with technology and the risk factors associated with
telecommunications projects is dampen ing international financiers' interest in
Latin American telecommunications infrastructure deals, said speakers at
Americas Telecom '96, a November conference in San Francisco sponsored by the
<B>Institute of the Americas.</B></P>
<P>&quot;Telecom financial deals have been scarce,&quot; said Rich Damiano,
project finance director for <B>Lucent Technologies,</B> the former <B>AT&amp;T
 Bell Laboratories</B> recently spun off as a separate company. &quot;We keep
trying [to do deals], but we're not getting there yet.&quot; Damiano said the
problem is that, given the competition for capital, financial institutions tend
to concentrate on what they are &quot;more comfortable with,&quot; namely,
power, pipelines and energy. &quot;We need to educate investors so they can
properly assess telecommunications risk,&quot; Damiano said. For example,
helping investors understand the differences between TDMA and CDMA (two
competing technologies used in cellular telephony) can go a long way to
mobilizing capital for cellular projects, one of the fastest-growing areas in
Latin American telecommunications.</P>
<H3>Big Investments Needed</H3>
<P>During the next five to seven years, investment requirements in telecom are
projected to be $100 billion. The Brazilian government will soon begin to
auction off licenses for Band B cellular communications (<I>P&amp;F</I> 11/96),
and capital requirements for licenses alone are estimated to run between $3
billion and $5 billion for the entire country. A license in densely populated
Sao Paulo may require $1 billion or more, Damiano said.</P>
<H3>Ready To Help</H3>
<P>Steve Howlett, senior business development officer for<B> US Eximbank,</B>
and Walter Jones, Latin America regional manager for the <B>Overseas Private
Investment Corp. (OPIC)</B> said that both of their government-backed
institutions are ready and willing to finance telecom deals in Latin America. 
But Howlett acknowledged that telecom projects make up only a small percentage
of Eximbank's total participation in Latin projects, though the region
constitutes 40% of the bank's worldwide exposure. He added that Eximbank is
willing to undertake very small telecom transactions, pointing to a $41,000 deal
in Argentina last year.</P>
<H3>Who Is The Customer?</H3>
<P>But international lenders still perceive risks in the field. In cellular
services, for example, there is no guaranteed subscriber base. By contrast,
investors in power deals are confident that most people will want electricity in
their homes. The &quot;take or pay&quot; financing structure (by which
purchasers agree in advance to pay for a certain amount of power) common in the
power sector is not going to be obtainable in telecom, Damiano said.</P>
<P>So where can telecom projects turn? Damiano said they will have to rely on
multiple sources of financing. Only established, government-owned telecom
companies in the region can count on capital markets, either through IPOs or
some form of asset securitization. New and growing entities must rely on
sponsors' equity, subordinated debt and maybe local bank debt, which varies from
country to country. Banks in Argentina, for example, may parcel out five- to
seven-year loans, &quot;but we're not seeing this in Brazil,&quot; Damiano said.</P>
<P>Even established companies cannot always rely on 144A and Eurobond markets
for new money: post-devaluation Mexico proved that capital markets will still
flee at the first signs of crisis.</P>
<P>Damiano pointed to several US and international agencies as potential
financing sources for telecom projects. OPIC &quot;understands cellular as well
as anyone&quot; and &quot;offers instant credibility to a project,&quot; he
said. Eximbank also offers attractive rates, but deals must have US sponsors to
be eligible for the bank's programs. Besides the <B>International Finance Corp.</B>
and the<B> Inter-American Investment Corp.,</B> Damiano called on the <B>World
Bank</B>'s <B>Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)</B> to get more
involved in political and economic risk insurance. Commercial banks are another
source, but they still want full-recourse financing for telecom projects, he
said. &#167;</P>
<H2>CABEI Increases Funds For Private Projects</H2>
<P>The <B>Central American Bank for Economic Integra tion (CABEI)</B> plans to
boost private-sector lending from 25% to 40% of its loan portfolio, emphasizing
infrastructure projects and small and medium exporters. The Tegucigalpa-based
bank expects to approve some $500 million in loans with half going to the
private sector, said chief financial officer Jaime Chavez- Almendares. During FY
1995-96, which ended June 30, CABEI approved $442 million, with $294 million
targeted to private-sector firms. The net loan portfolio for the fiscal year
totaled $1.4 billion.</P>
<H3>Dominant Force</H3>
<P>By far the region's largest lender, CABEI lends to companies domiciled in
Central America that are at least 51%-owned by nationals from the shareholder
countries. Besides the Central American shareholders (Costa Rica,</P>
<P>El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), current outside
shareholders are Mexico, Argentina and Taiwan. Colombia is joining CABEI and
plans to make its capital subscription shortly, and South Korea, Brazil and
Chile have announced intentions to become shareholders. Venezuela is awaiting
legislative approval of its application.</P>
<P>Under CABEI's lending terms, a joint venture 51% owned by Mexican partners
and domiciled in, say, Guatemala, would be eligible for loans. The most ener
getic countries for private-sector activity are El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa
Rica, Chavez-Almendares said.</P>
<H3>Where The Money Went</H3>
<P>Last year, CABEI approved $84 million in loans for Guatemala's private
sector. Of the total, $68 million went to productive facilities and short-term
trade finance; $8.5 million to the 10 MW Pasabien hydroelectric project; and
$7.8 million to small and medium companies. Loans totaling $126 million were
approved for the public sector, including $60 million for telecommunications and
$57 million for road improvements.</P>
<P>El Salvador's private sector received $98 million, including $48 million for
productive facilities and $24 million for short-term trade finance. Small and
medium companies got $6.2 million, while the public sector got a total of $38
million.</P>
<P>For Costa Rica's private sector, the bank approved $41 million in loans,
including $15 million for productive facilities and $11 million for trade
finance. Small and medium companies received $10 million, and loans to the
public sector totaled $48 million.</P>
<H3>Bigger Slice For Nicaragua</H3>
<P>In Nicaragua, CABEI hopes to increase its lending portfolio by putting
together a &quot;Brady-like&quot; plan for the country, Chavez-Almendares said.
By extending the maturities of $300 million of loans using US treasury
zero-coupon bonds as collateral, CABEI would be able to loan another $300
million to Nicaragua. The bank is approaching various donor countries, including
shareholders, to provide the bonds. By the end of June, Nicaragua was CABEI's
largest debtor, with $476 million in outstanding loans. </P>
