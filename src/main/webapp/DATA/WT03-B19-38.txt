<img src="t.gif"align=left>ired of manually preparing tedious multiple calibration 
standards? Frustrated at having to manually dilute and re-analyze overrange 
samples?  Let <a href="http://www.varian.com/inst/osi/sips.htm">SIPS </A>(patent pending) eliminate the need for these time-consuming, 
yet necessary chores.  Varian's patented automatic Sample Introduction Pump 
System (SIPS), increases productivity, ensures accuracy, and reduces consumables 
costs.  Russ Calow, Manager of Analytical Services, and Robert Irwin, 
Senior Chemist--Atomic Absorption Laboratory at Lakefield Research Analytical 
Services in Ontario, Canada recently discovered SIPS' benefits.  Using the 
SIPS-10, the lab team increased throughput by 20% with precisions two to 
three percentage points better than manually prepared solutions.<P>
<img src="clocksm.gif" align=right>
<h4<Reduces Costs</h4>
SIPS is an ideal tool for the Lakefield lab for a number of reasons.  
The foremost reason is that SIPS reduces costs. The lab, which analyzes 
metal, organic, and inorganic materials for mining, waste, and land 
reclamation, initially purchased SIPS for its on-line calibration and 
dilution capabilites.  The auotmation of these tasks, previously completed 
manually, has also increased their productivity.  Before
purchasing SIPS, the lab team had been manually producing less than six
determinations per 
<img src="table.gif" align=left>hour worked; with the addition of SIPS, determinations were close to seven 
per hour worked.  With SIPS' "walk away ability," lab operators are now 
able to prepare samples, handle data, and run two or three instruments 
simultaneously.  The lab runs the instrument two shifts a day, five 
days a week, with additional shifts on the weekend.<P>
<h4>Increases Accuracy</h4>
In addition to increasing productivity, SIPS is proving to be extremely accurate.  
Calow reports that "during the instrument commissioning phase, the automatic 
calibration and on-line dilution capabilities of the SIPS system were carefully 
checked."  Calow's team prepared a study, and as Table 1 indicates, no significant 
difference exists between the SIPS prepared standards and the manually prepared 
standards for the listed elements. Calow asserts that, "the SIPS prepared
standards 
display relative standard deviations on the order of two to three percentage
points 
better than manually prepared standards." <P>
<a href="http://www.varian.com/inst/osi/uvnews.htm"><img src="vaduzitagn.gif" 
align=right></A>
One caveat, however.  Process solutions, which are too viscous to analyze 
directly without pre-dilution, can compromise the accuracy of SIPS. <P>

Calow points out that besides increasing productivity and accuracy, SIPS 
also has a low consumables cost.  The Lakefield lab uses one peristaltic 
pump tube per month.  Other flow-through instruments can have weekly or bi-weekly 
tube changes.  Another bonus for SIPS users is the instrument's user-friendliness: 
the Lakefield team was able to get the instrument into full production in only 
one week, including the time needed for checking the on-line calibration and 
dilution capabilities of the system.<P>
SIPS has dramatically changed lab sample preparation techniques by insuring 
accuracy, increasing productivity, and decreasing costs significantly.  
In the process, SIPS has revitalized flame AA technology.<P>

Varian's auto-diluter for the <a href="http://www.varian.com/inst/osi/sps.htm">
SPS-5 Sample Preparation System </A>is now compatible 
with the UltraMass ICP-MS!   The SPS-5 saves lab time and money by providing 
accurate and automatic on-line dilution of overrange analytes during ICP-MS 
analysis.  The SPS-5 auto-diluter, which is a precision syringe under PC 
control, frees lab operators to perform other tasks while the UltraMass 
continues the analysis.  In addition to its on-line capabilities, the auto-diluter 
also aids in off-line sample preparation, and it prevents cross-
contamination and dilution errors.<P>

<h4>Accurate Results</h4>

Traditionally, manual dilution has been the preferred option for samples t
hat contain a higher concentration of elements--such as sodium, potassium, 
calcium, magnesium, and some abundant transition elements such as iron--that 
exceed the range of ICP-MS.  Without the SPS-5 auto-diluter, lab technicians 
have had to perform tedious, off-line dilutions manually to ensure accurate 
sample analysis. Other ICP-MS techniques have attempted to address the problem 
of overrange analytes: some instruments employ dual range detectors with pulse 
counting detection for trace level analytes and analog detection for high range 
analytes.  However, unless the sample is diluted, the overrange analyte ions 
will still be present in the ion beam which can lead to space-charge effects 
and can introduce mass bias interferences in the results.<P>
  
With the SPS-5 auto-diluter, quick and efficient sample dilution is easy 
and fast.  Mounted as a module at the rear of the auto-sampler, the diluter 
automatically dilutes and remeasures overrange analytical isotopes.  The 
dilution factor is determined by the software which takes into account 
the size of the signal relative to the calibration range.  In the event 
of the sample still coming in overrange, the software will instruct the 
auto-diluter to perform another dilution.<P>

<h4>Increases Productivity</h4> 

Because the diluter is automatically controlled via software, lab operators 
are free to perform other functions, saving both time and money. The SPS-5, 
which is capable of automatically checking the accuracy of dilution at the 
start and finish of a sequence run, also ensures compliance with Good 
Laboratory Practice requirements in monitoring the accuracy of the dilution 
system.  And, in addition to its on-line capabilities, the SPS-5 auto-diluter 
can be used off-line for most sample preparation tasks--dilution, spiking, 
standard additions, reagent additions and standard preparation--for optimum 
lab efficiency.  <P>

<h4>Eliminates Contamination</h4>
Each solution aliquot taken by the auto-dilutor is separated by a volume 
of air while a sample holding coil ensures that the sample never enters the 
syringe. This unique design eliminates cross-contamination.  The diluter is 
also provided with an overflow rinse well which cleans the probe inside and 
out.<P>

efficiently,  contact your Varian sales representative today about how 
you can turn your ICP-MS into a productivity workhorse with the SPS-5 
auto-diluter.  <P>

Automate the dissolution process, eliminate tedious manual sampling, and increase
accuracy with the new Cary Dissolution System. New Easy menu software, when
combined with the VanKel dissolution bath and Cary spectrometer, provides a level
of automation not previously available in tablet dissolution testing.  The system,
which is ideal for both pharmaceutical research and quality control, can monitor a
dissolution run for up to 8000 minutes, more than any other comparable
instrument.<P>
<center><img src="setupsm.gif"></center><P>
	The Cary-VanKel system is a total dissolution solution, offering users
unattended, overnight operation delivered via fully automated bath temperature,
paddle and basket stir speeds, pump direction, and tablet dropping.  This means
that you can set and forget until the measurement is complete.<P>
	Additionally, the automated Cary system offers a flow-through method which
measures samples in real time as compared to HPLC techniques.  Flow-through also
eliminates cross contamination--which occurs with multi-port dissolution
methods--and reduces the risk of precipitation of the active ingredient by
recycling the solution back into the vessels.<P>
	The software is fully integrated with Varian's <a href="http://www.varian.com/
	inst/osi/caryl.htm">Cary UV-Nis-NIR
spectrophotometers</A> supporting 6-, 7-, or 8- vessel dissolution runs for both
USP/BP/EP paddle and basket methods.  All instrumentation setup and reporting
selections are placed in one window within the software, enhancing ease of use.<P>
