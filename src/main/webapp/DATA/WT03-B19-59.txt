<H1>U.S. Forest Service Fire Monitoring</H1>

<P>
SeaSpace responded to an urgent request in August 1994 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (USFS) office in Ogden, Utah by providing a TeraScan processing system.  One
day after initial contact, USFS personnel arrived in San Diego for training and acceptance of the system.  The USFS satisfies its real-time data requirements via digital data from one of SeaSpace's own in-house acquisition systems.  The
satellite data is provided to the USFS TeraScan system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by telephone modem.  The SeaSpace support staff wrote customized
scripts to extract sections of <A HREF="/glossary.html#AVHRR">AVHRR</A> data needed by the USFS to monitor areas that are burning, plus
regions previosly burnt and blackened.  These data are then further processed, compiled with other sources of weather data, and 
analyzed by remote sensing specialists at the Ogden center.
