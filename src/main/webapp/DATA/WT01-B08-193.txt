<FONT SIZE=3>BXA conducts primary research and analysis on critical technology developments, the effect of imports on national security, and industrial base capabilities.  These projects provide needed data and recommendations to government policy makers and industry leaders to help maintain and enhance American defense and economic security. <P>

BXA industrial base assessments are typically initiated in one of four ways:  Congressional mandate; petition from industry; request from the Defense Department (DOD); or self-initiation.  To conduct its assessments, BXA devises technology-specific and industry-specific surveys to collect information related to the health and competitiveness of specific industries that are vital to the national security of the United States.  This is done with the assistance of industry experts, both from the private sector and other government agencies.  In this way a partnership between industry and government is formed at the beginning of each project, which enhances the quality of the assessment and the effective use of its results.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Critical Technology Assessments:</B></FONT>
<A NAME="index7"></A><FONT SIZE=3>  A portion of the analytical studies conducted by BXA are mandated by the Congress.  This is the case with the critical technology program, created by the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Acts of 1991 and 1993.  In these Acts, BXA is directed to work with the Department of Defense (DOD) in conducting in-depth industry assessments of technologies identified by DOD as being most critical to the development of future weapon systems, as well as crucial to the nation's ability to compete in the global economy.  The analysis goes beyond solely defense production capabilities.  BXA evaluates overall competitiveness, including financial, production, and technical capabilities.  In the past few years BXA has published assessments on a number of existing and emerging industries, from advanced composites to superconductivity.  The most recent studies are listed below.

<B>Critical Technology Assessment of the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Industry</B><BR> 
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>(PB 93-192409)  August 1994 - Price $95<P></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="index2"></A>
The BXA assessment of the U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) industry found that while the United States currently leads the world in nearly all aspects of this technology, its leadership position is eroding.  Two conditions threaten the country's lead:  first, the slow rate of AI commercialization relative to massive research and development (R&D) and expenditures; and second, declines in Department of Defense R&D funding.  Cuts in the military budget have reduced overall AI R&D shifted funds away from basic science and long-term projects.  The Federal Government sponsored about 75 percent of AI research in the United States between 1989 and 1994; over 80 percent of the Federal total came from the Defense Department.  The commercial sector will not come close to replacing these lost R&D funds, particularly for basic research.<P>

The Department of Defense is by far the single largest user of artificial intelligence in the world.  The military uses AI systems for diagnostics, testing, robotics, target recognition, tutoring, war planning, logistics, nuclear test-ban monitoring, database management, and defense-related manufacturing.<p>

<B>Critical Technology Assessment of the U.S. Advanced Ceramics Industry</B><BR> 
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>(PB 93-182383)  December 1993 - Price $95<P></CENTER></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>

In this critical technology assessment, it was estimated that the 1990 U.S. market for advanced ceramic components was $3.6 billion.  Products destined for electronics end uses account for approximately 80 percent of this figure.  Ceramics are used in such electronic applications as ceramic packages, capacitors and sensors.  They are also used extensively in structural applications, such as engines, cutting tools, armor, and wear components.  Defense applications of advanced ceramics are wide-ranging, covering both electronic and structural applications.  Ceramic semiconductor packages, for example, have innumerable uses in defense electronics.  Other defense applications include vehicle and personnel armor and aircraft parts.  Although commercial markets for advanced ceramics predominate, the industry has been adversely affected by recent cuts in defense spending.  The decrease in these markets, combined with a general decline in the economy, resulted in lowered profits and higher debt loads for the industry.  The repercussions were significant:  defense-dependent firms lacked the financial strength to convert their operations; companies found themselves unable to fund research and development needed to remain competitive; and firms could not afford to maintain their defense production capabilities.<p>

(PB 93-192391)  December 1993 - Price $95</CENTER><p></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>

The U.S. advanced composites industry was found to be driven by defense aerospace applications, the largest U.S. end-user market of advanced composites, while foreign advanced composite industries are more focused on commercial applications.  Reductions in U.S. defense spending, particularly in military aircraft applications, resulted in the downsizing of U.S. industry, declining profits, employment, and private research and development (R&D) expenditures.  Recent years have also shown an increased government share of the industry's total R&D, indicating a growing dependency on defense dollars during a time of defense reductions.  The implications for the U.S. industry were found to be negative, because of the reliance on U.S. defense business and a difficulty in converting to commercial applications.<p>

(PB 93-192425)  February 1994 - Price $95</CENTER><P></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>

The Department of Defense (DOD) deemed optoelectronics to be one of the technologies essential to the development of the next generation of weapon systems; however, it is also crucial to the nation's ability to compete in the global economy.  In this assessment it was determined that this industry is dependent on single sources of supply - often foreign - for many components, including glass, optical fiber, and electronic circuits.  The industry also relies on a wide range of imported machinery and equipment, parts, and raw materials.  The report contains a number of other findings and conclusions.<p>

(PB 93-192433)  April 1994 - Price $95<P></center></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>

This assessment utilizes data collected from firms in the domestic superconductivity industry to assess the factors which impact the competitiveness and viability of this important sector.  The Department of Defense (DOD) deemed superconductivity to be one of the technologies essential to the development of the next generation of weapon systems; however, it is also crucial to the nation's ability to compete in the global economy.  The report addresses a wide range of issues in three broadly defined areas: enabling technologies; components and devices; and systems and applications.  Employment grew modestly from 1989 to 1992, while sales to the government grew by 286 percent.  These sales, however, were small in relation to the industry's commercial sales.  About two-thirds of the industry is adversely affected by reductions in defense spending, in two different ways: directly, because over 50 percent of reported Federal research and development (R&D) funding came from DOD; and indirectly, by restricting defense-oriented customers of superconductivity-related products, restricting these products' sales and thus producers' money for R&D.<p>
