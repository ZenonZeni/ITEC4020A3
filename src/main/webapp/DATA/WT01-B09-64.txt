<B>Project Title: Heavy-Duty Hybrid Electric Buses<p>
Performing Organization: Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact: Mahesh Talwar  (805) 961-8922</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>


<P>Five hybrid electric buses will be converted or built in this program for use in  three separate California locales.  The buses will be operated in both commercial and military environments for performance, range, and durability.</P>

<P>APS Systems, Inc. has converted one 28-foot and two 40-foot school bus-type transit buses at Vandenberg Air Force Base to a hybrid electric configuration.  The buses are driven by twin 50-kilowatt air-cooled APS/Indramat AC power trains, giving the buses a top speed of approximately 50 mph.  Power for the electric drive motors is supplied by lead-acid batteries, coupled to an auxiliary power unit (APU).  The APUs on these buses are Cummins 4B 3.9-liter naturally aspirated spark ignition engines, operated on compressed natural gas.</P>

<P>The buses achieve a range of approximately 180 miles, and their emissions have been tested in the range of 1.0-1.5 grams/brake-horsepower-hour of NOx.</P>

<P>APS Systems, Inc. is also developing a purpose-built 40-foot heavy-duty hybrid electric transit bus.  This bus will also be driven by APS/Indramat AC motors and controllers, with Saft nickel-cadmium batteries providing the power for the drive train.  The APU is a turbocharged Cummins 4B 3.9 liter spark ignition engine, producing 50 kilowatts of electrical power.  The engine will operate on natural gas.  The curb weight of this bus will be approximately 20,400 pounds, representing a savings of approximately 8,000-9,000 pounds from a standard bus.  The structural design of this bus is based on a smaller electric bus being constructed by APS under another CALSTART project.  The APS bus will be used in regular transit service in the City of Lompoc.</P>

<P>The fifth bus in this program is a conversion of a Gillig Phantom 40-foot transit bus.  The bus was originally specified with an FMC motor, but Gillig will now perform the conversion with a Siemens drive train.  This bus will also have a Cummins 4B 3.9 liter turbocharged engine running on natural gas for an auxiliary power unit and will include 30 kilowatt-hours of Horizon batteries for energy storage.  The bus is designed for a range of approximately 200 miles.  It will be used by the Golden Gate Transit District.</P>

<P><B>Program Deliverables</B></P>

<P>This program will produce and put into service five hybrid electric buses of various sizes, as well as the charging and refueling facilities.  Detailed operational and performance data will also be collected and summarized through the CALSTART data acquisition effort.</P>

<P><B>Program Schedule</B></P>	

<P>The three converted Vandenberg Air Force Base buses were delivered in late 1994.  The APS purpose-built bus will be delivered in the summer of 1996, as will the Gillig bus.</P>
