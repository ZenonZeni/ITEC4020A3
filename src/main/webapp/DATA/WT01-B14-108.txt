<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
October 21, 1996</I>

ALT="Will the Japanese Election Alter Perceptions of the Optimal
Yen Rate?"><BR>

There has been such a broad based global rally in equity and bond
prices during recent weeks that the strength of Wall Street has
not had a major impact on the value of the dollar.
<P>
Buying and selling of the D-mark in response to changing perceptions
of the outlook for European monetary union has driven fluctuations
in the dollar/D-mark rate, not economic developments in the U.S.
itself.<I> The monetary union factor is likely to remain the dominant
influence on the D-mark for many months to come.</I> If the Russian
political situation deteriorates significantly in the aftermath
of Mr. Lebed's dismissal, there could be broad based selling of
European currencies but the market may ultimately respond positively
to the Lebed dismissal if it bolsters the odds of Mr. Chernomyrdin
replacing Mr. Yeltsin in the event that his health deteriorate
further. Mr. Lebed has little support in the military and his
positive showing in the recent presidential election resulted
from Mr. Yeltsin's financial backers giving him a boost in the
final weeks of the campaign. Russia has many new wealthy people
and they will rally around the current prime minister or mayor
of Moscow in the next presidential election.
<P>
The most recent German economic data confirms that the economy
experienced a healthy upturn during the third quarter, but French
data continues to show depressed confidence in both the corporate
and household sectors. Strikes will also disrupt the French economy
during the next few weeks. While the focal point of the market's
EMU concerns during recent days has been Spain and Italy, <I>it
is important to remember that monetary union could still be derailed
if the French economy fails to improve during the next few quarters.</I>
France will not be able to achieve its budget targets without
an economic upturn in 1997. The Juppe government could also suffer
major parliamentary losses in the 1998 parliamentary elections
if the economy fails to improve. Indeed, President Chriac will
probably abandon Mr. Juppe next spring if French unemployment
continues to increase.
<P>
Japan will hold elections for its national parliament (the Diet)
on October 20th. On the basis of current opinion polls, the LDP
will probably emerge as the dominant party again and may even
win an outright majority. As with New Zealand, the coming Japanese
election will be the first to be held under a system of proportional
representation. As a result, the old post-1955 division between
an entrenched LDP majority and a permanent socialist minority
will give way to a new equilibrium with two large centrist parties,
one moderate sized centrist party and a few fringe parties. If
the LDP fails to win a majority, it will have to form a coalition
with the small centrist party or persuade members of the other
large centrist party to defect. As the other parties have campaigned
for delaying next year's consumption tax hike and pursuing more
aggressive administrative reform than the LDP is advocating, such
a coalition would probably have a more positive impact on forecasts
of Japan' intermediate term growth outlook than a clear LDP majority.
<I>In fact, with the Japanese current account surplus now showing
signs of recovery, there is a risk that the return of a one party
LDP government could set the stage for renewed friction between
Washington and Tokyo over whether Japan is pursuing sufficient
macroeocnomic stimulus and microeconomic reform to stabilize the
trade surplus at moderate levels. </I>
<P>
The major case for a further large correction of the dollar against
the yen is the need for Japanese financial institutions to boost
the yields on their investment portfolios. The Japanese corporate
sector has a funding deficiency in its system of retirement savings
equal to about 25% of corporate equity. Japanese life insurance
companies have to generate a yield of at least 3.6% in order to
satisfy their policy holders while the yield on Japanese money
market assets is only 50 basis points. As a result of the constraints
on earning higher yields from Japanese assets, the most obvious
way for Japanese investment institutions to enhance their portfolio
return is to purchase more foreign debt and equities. There was
strong Japanese demand for U.S .bonds during August but this could
change quickly if there is any hint that the Clinton administration
will modify its exchange rate policy after the election. The White
House has favored a strong dollar since mid-1995 in order to lessen
the risk of a financial meltdown in Japan and encourage strong
foreign demand for U.S. securities at a time when the current
account deficit is still large. While the current exchange rate
policy should remain intact through the next few months, there
are many people in Washington who believe that deliberate dollar
depreciation/yen appreciation is an effective instrument for forcing
Japan to pursue more expansionary macroeconomics policies and
structural reform. They will not remain silent if the Japanese
trade surplus resumes widening during 1997 against a background
of static economic policy under a revitalized LDP.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize</B></I>, the resilience of financial markets
in countries as diverse as New Zealand, the Ukraine and Italy
during recent weeks confirms that the world is awash with surplus
liquidity and that investors have a robust appetite for increasing
risk in order to earn higher returns. The global financial markets
have not been in such a speculative mood since the second half
of 1993. The major threat to this new financial euphoria would
be a resurgence of U.S. output growth during the fourth quarter
which compelled the Fed to raise interest rates by 25-50 basis
points. There also could be a correction if President Clinton
wins re-election on a scale large enough to elect a Democratic
Congress with a house majority of 25 seats or more, but as the
New Zealand election demonstrates, investors might even downplay
the risks poised by a Democratic Congress on the grounds that
politicians have lost their ability to pursue policies hostile
to investors in the new global order of unrestricted electronic
transmission of information and capital. Ironically, though, the
election of a pro-business LDP government in Japan could set the
stage for new yen/dollar tensions during 1997 if it encourages
renewed complacency about microeconomic reform in Japan against
the backdrop of a resurgent trade surplus.
