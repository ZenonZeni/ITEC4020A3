</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Helvetica">America's Military Readiness Can't Wait</FONT> <BR>
</FONT></h3>
<P>
<P>
<B>Faster, smarter, better. </FONT></B>
<P>
That's the goal for America's military, and it also
applies more than ever to how advanced military technologies are
developed, produced and deployed. Given current budgets, <U>it's
a must</U>.</FONT>
<P>

<img align=left src="/image/arpas95c1.gif" alt="CAPTION = New technologies overcome the old in a
unique partnership between ARPA and consortia nationwide.">
<P>The Advanced Research Projects Agency - ARPA - is
developing critical new technologies faster, smarter, and better
today in a unique cost-shared partnership with industry. As a
result, its projects are placing more advanced electric and hybrid
electric drive systems and technologies on the road than anyone
in the world.</FONT>
<P>
Here are just a few examples since last winter's
<I>Progress Report</I>: </FONT>
<P><ul>
<li> <FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=#808080 FACE="Wingdings"></FONT><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Wingdings">
</FONT>The nation's first fully integrated hybrid
electric troop transport buses entered service at Vandenberg Air
Force Base; </FONT>
<P>
<li> <FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=#808080 FACE="Wingdings"></FONT><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Wingdings">
</FONT>Two ground-breaking all-composite electric
vehicles were unveiled; </FONT>
<P>
<li> <FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=#808080 FACE="Wingdings"></FONT><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000 FACE="Wingdings">
</FONT>Electric-powered armored transport vehicles
took to the roads; </FONT>
<P>
<li> A flywheel-powered truck began testing. </FONT>
<P>
</ul>And dozens of advanced electric vehicles, ranging
from bus-sized to pick-ups, were being built, tested and deployed
in military and civilian missions across the nation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Innovative Regional Teams</FONT></h3>
<P><ul>
<FONTCOLOR=#000000>ARPA has made this happen by helping
create and support innovative regional teams of technology developers.
These consortia are made up of defense and aerospace firms, hi-tech
companies, national and private labs and universities, utilities
and others. Their task: push the limits on new drive systems and
vehicles. </FONT>
<P>
The results of these efforts are substantial technology
improvements developed quickly at minimal public investment. </FONT>
<P>
What's the critical need for this technology? ARPA
has looked over the horizon and found America's current ground
vehicle systems will be obsolete in just 10 years. What America
needs now for military preparedness is a headstart on what will
move tomorrow's combat vehicles.</FONT>
<P>
What will survive on the battleground of the future?
Something that's quiet... stealthy... ultra-efficient... fast...
requires less logistical support... and can power the next generation
of smart, powerful offensive/defensive capabilities. The answer
is advanced electric drive systems.
</FONT>
<P></ul><h3>
<FONT COLOR=#808080>Leading-Edge Capabilities</FONT></h3>
<P><ul>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>But there's more to the ARPA consortia
than just rapid technology development. Just as important is creating
a flexible manufacturing base to support future military needs,
a base that can support itself in the marketplace while still
providing leading-edge capabilities to America's defense.</FONT>
<P>
This is possible because the very same technologies
so vitally important to our national defense are also critical
to America's industrial and environmental future. These drive
systems have tremendous commercial uses in clean, efficient transportation
systems, as well. That mutual need not only provides the market
base that lowers costs, it's helping speed development and innovation
times tremendously.</FONT>
<P>
We're doing it the ARPA way.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B>Faster, smarter, and better.</B></I>
<P></ul>
