AMERICANS BEHIND BARS:<br>
THE INTERNATIONAL USE OF INCARCERATION, 1992-93<br>
OVERVIEW<br>
Interest in international comparisons on the use of incarceration
has increased in recent years. From the Singapore caning of
Michael Fay to changes in the use of prisons in eastern Europe to
the use of prison labor in China, attention has focused on the
ways in which nations utilize different sentencing policies.<br>
In recent years, we have issued two prior reports comparing
international rates of incarceration. These reports documented
that the United States had become the world leader in its rate of
incarceration, having surpassed South Africa and the former
Soviet Union, and that the black male rate of incarceration in
the U.S. far exceeded that of black males in South Africa.<br>
We now look again at these issues, in what is the most
comprehensive survey to date on international rates of
incarceration. The main findings of this report are the
following:<br>
 Russia has now surpassed the United States to become the world
leader in its rate of incarceration, with 558 citizens per
100,000 population in its prison system. The rise of organized
crime, political instability, and the transition to an uncertain
economic future have all played a factor in crime rates and the
use of imprisonment.<br>
 With 1.3 million Americans behind bars, the U.S. rate of
incarceration is 519 per 100,000, second in the world among the
52 nations covered in this survey. The U.S. rate has increased by
22 percent since 1989, and is generally 5-8 times the rate of
most industrialized nations.<br>
 A racial breakdown of the U.S. inmate population shows that
African-Americans are incarcerated at a rate that is more than
six times that of whites -- 1,947 per 100,000, compared to 306
per 100,000. <br>
 Black males in the U.S. are incarcerated at more than four
times the rate of black males in South Africa -- 3,822 per
100,000 versus 851 per 100,000.<br>
 The cost of incarceration nationally in the U.S. is estimated
at $26.8 billion annually. Estimated costs of incarceration for
African-American males are $11.6 billion annually.<br>
 The number of AfricanAmerican males in prisons and jails in
the U.S. 583,000 is greater than the number of AfricanAmerican
males enrolled in higher education 537,000.<br>
 Drug, property and public order offenders accounted for 84
percent of the 155 percent increase in new court commitments to
state prison from 1980 to 1992, while violent offenders accounted
for only 16 percent of the increase.<br>
As we have stated in past reports, a nation's rate of
incarceration in itself only describes one aspect of its criminal
justice or social policies. For example, a nation with a high
rate of incarceration might have a high rate of crime, a harsh
sentencing system, a politically repressive government, or some
combination of these and other factors. Similarly, one cannot
assume that nations with low incarceration rates necessarily have
low crime rates or are respectful of civil liberties. For
example, the cost of largescale incarceration is prohibitive for
many Third World nations, so they maintain a low imprisonment
rate. Other nations maintain a relatively low incarceration rate,
yet have brutal conditions of confinement. In Zaire, for example,
although the incarceration rate is a relatively modest 88 per
100,000, it has been reported that nearly 7.5 percent of the
inmates in the prison system die each year due to malnutrition
and poor health care.<br>
With these cautions in mind, we look at the dramatically high
rate of incarceration in the United States and attempt to assess
the factors that have created the anomaly of one of the
wealthiest nations in the world sharing the unenviable position
of incarceration leader with its former Cold War rival Russia.
Whatever the mix of crime rates, criminal justice policies, or
social policies that have led to this situation, the rate of
incarceration in the United States is so much higher than in
comparable nations that it requires a close examination of the
various causal factors. Given the renewed &quot;law and
order&quot; climate in the country, we also examine the
anticipated impact of newlyadopted legislation and conclude with
recommendations for what we believe would be a more rational
criminal justice policy.<br>

<u>Rates of Incarceration per 100,000 Population<br>
</u><b>INTERNATIONAL TRENDS IN THE USE OF INCARCERATION<br>
</b>As can be seen in Figure 1, the Russian Republic has now
replaced the United States as the world leader in its use of
incarceration, with a rate of incarceration of 558 per 100,000.
By all accounts, this has been the result of a greatly increased
use of incarceration since the fall of the Soviet Union. For
comparative purposes, estimates of the use of incarceration by
the Soviet Union in 1989 ranged from 268 to 353 per 100,000.<br>
A variety of factors have led to the increased use of
incarceration in Russia. News accounts have discussed the rise of
organized crime, coming at a time of much economic and political
instability. As the country moves toward a market economy, the
social disruption and loss of a limited social &quot;safety
net&quot; for some may contribute to higher crime rates. It has
been reported that during the first quarter of 1994, there was an
average of 84 murders a day in Russia, a per capita rate that is
about double that of the U.S. The use of the prison system for
political prisoners, both in the past and at present, is an issue
for which there are few precise figures. The State Department has
also reported that because the court system does not have the
resources to handle the increasing number of arrests, defendants
are often held in pretrial detention for more than a year without
judicial review. <br>
While comparative data are not readily available, some reports
indicate that the high rate of incarceration in Russia may be in
good part a result of harsher sentencing practices than other
nations, and not primarily differences in crime rates. Comparing
prison populations and sentencing practices in Russia to England
and Wales, Roy D. King concluded that &quot;it would seem that
many offenders are swept into the prison system for much more
trivial offences, for much longer periods, and at much earlier
points in their criminal careers [in Russia] than would be the
case in Britain.&quot;<br>
The rate of incarceration in South Africa continues to remain far
above that of most other nations as well, at 368 per 100,000
population. It should be noted that these figures are from the
end of 1993, prior to the historic change of government in 1994.
Therefore, it is too early to know what changes, if any, will be
instituted by the new government. One early indication of a
possible direction was a reduction of almost all prison sentences
by six months following a nationwide series of prison
disturbances in June, 1994.<br>
In a number of European countries, though not all, incarceration
rates have been rising in recent years. In the Netherlands, long
considered a leader in the limited use of incarceration, the rate
of incarceration doubled during the 1980s. Even with this
increase, however, the country's current rate of 49 per 100,000
still places it at onetenth the U.S. rate and far below most
industrialized nations.<br>
Comparing data for 1989 from our first report, we find that
Italy's rate of incarceration increased by 33 percent in the
period 198992, while Austria, Spain, and Switzerland registered
gains in the 1416 percent range, and France and Denmark were
virtually unchanged. <br>
In the U.S., which was the world leader in 1989, incarceration
rates have increased by 22 percent from 426 per 100,000 in 1989
to 519 per 100,000 for 199293. Thus, the rate of incarceration in
the U.S. is approximately five to eight times the rate of Canada
and most European nations. With a total of 1.3 million inmates in
the U.S., at an estimated annual cost of incarceration of $20,000
a year, the national cost of imprisonment in the U.S. is
approximately $26.8 billion. Costs of incarceration for the
583,000 incarcerated African-American males are estimated at
$11.6 billion annually. <br>
As has been seen in previous reports, the rate of incarceration
for African-American males is a major component of the high U.S.
rates. Tables 2 and 3 below compare racial differences in
incarceration in the U.S. and South Africa while still under
apartheid.<br>

<p> <b>WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATE OF
INCARCERATION? <br>
</b>It would appear logical in many respects to assume that a
high rate of incarceration is a direct response to high crime
rates. In recent years, though, many criminologists and
policymakers have concluded that imprisonment rates are to a
great degree a function of criminal justice and social policies
that either encourage or discourage the use of incarceration. The
current wave of &quot;Three Strikes and You're Out&quot;
proposals illustrates this well. States that have passed such
legislation will soon experience an increase in their prison
populations of varying degrees depending on the scope of the
legislation. While one can debate whether or not these policies
are appropriate or will have an impact on crime, it is clear that
conscious policy choices are creating a higher rate of
imprisonment.<br>
We can see this as well by comparing incarceration rates among
the states, where we find that a state's use of imprisonment is
not necessarily directly related to its crime rate. For example,
while Louisiana had the nation's highest rate of incarceration in
1992 and also had a high crime rate (fifth in the nation),
Oklahoma was third in its imprisonment rate despite being just
21st in its crime rate.<br>
At the other end of the spectrum, North Dakota was lowest in the
nation in both crime and incarceration rates, but Mississippi was
40th nationally in its rate of incarceration despite having the
16th highest crime rate. Decisions made by legislators and
criminal justice officials, including sentencing legislation,
parole policies, and the availability of sentencing options and
community resources, all play a role in determining incarceration
rates.<br>
In the following sections, we examine several factors that might
be thought to contribute to the high rate of incarceration in the
United States. These include:<br>
- overall crime rates<br>
- violent crime rates<br>
- severity of sentencing policies<br>
- cultural attitudes toward punishment<br>
<u>Does the United States Have a High Rate of Incarceration
Because of Higher Crime Rates Than Other Nations?<br>
</u>As we have seen, high incarceration rates can be a function
of high crime rates, criminal justice policies, or social
policies in other areas that influence crime. Some persons
contend that the United States has a high rate of incarceration
due to its high rate of crime or violent crime rate, compared to
other nations. <br>
Although there are a number of methodological problems involved
in comparing crime and incarceration rates among nations,
criminologists have attempted to study this issue in a variety of
ways. A recent survey of this issue looked at whether
incarceration rates in six industrialized nations (England and
Wales, West Germany, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, and
Sweden) could be explained by national crime rates. The
conclusion was that &quot;only a small measure of the differences
in prison population between one jurisdiction and another or the
changes in prison populations within particular jurisdictions
seem to be related to crime rates.&quot;<br>
Further, the assumption that crime rates are substantially higher
in the U.S. than in other industrialized nations is not true for
most offenses. A comprehensive survey of victimization rates in
the industrialized world conducted by the Dutch Ministry of
Justice documented that rates of property crime and some
assaultive crimes in the U.S. are not significantly different
than in many comparable nations. The twenty nation survey found
that four nations (New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada, and
Australia) exceeded the U.S. rate of victimization for the eleven
crimes surveyed, including robbery, burglary, and car theft.
Among individual offenses, the survey found that burglary rates
in the U.S. were exceeded by New Zealand, Czechoslovakia,
Australia, and Canada; that England, Australia, and New Zealand
had higher rates of car theft; and that five nations
(Czechoslovakia, Poland, Australia, Canada, and West Germany) had
higher rates of sexual assault against women.<br>
The victimization survey also confirms that the commission of a
crime is to a certain extent a result of opportunity. For
example, car theft rates are highest in countries where
automobile ownership is high (such as the U.S., Australia, and
England), while bicycle thefts also correlate with high ownership
rates (as in the Netherlands and Sweden). Similarly, burglary
rates are highest in countries with a significant proportion of
semidetached or detached homes (including the U.S., Poland,
England, and Australia). These findings have implications for
crime prevention, such as making greater use of mass transit.<br>
The data on crime victimization overall, therefore, does not
provide an explanation for the high incarceration rate in the
U.S. While it remains possible that crime rates account for part
of the difference in rates of incarceration, the magnitude of the
difference between the U.S. and other nations is so great that
overall crime rates cannot account for the disparity.<br>
<u>Do Rates of Violent Crime Explain the High Rate of
Incarceration in the U.S.?<br>
</u>Looking at rates of violent crime, we see sharper
distinctions between the U.S. and most industrialized nations, in
large part due to the role of firearms in U.S. crime rates. Rates
of assault and murder with firearms are far higher in the U.S.
than in comparable nations, with murder rates in the U.S.
generally five to ten times the rate of most European nations.
Since a violent offender is generally more likely to be
incarcerated upon conviction than a nonviolent offender, a higher
violent crime rate would be expected to result in a higher
imprisonment rate.<br>
We do not have sufficient data to analyze the relative
proportions of violent and nonviolent offenders in other prison
systems, or to assess how they compare to the U.S. in this
regard. What is available, though, is information regarding the
increase in the American prison population in recent years.
Examining these data demonstrates that the substantial rise in
the inmate population since 1980 was not primarily due to
incarceration of violent offenders. <br>
As seen in Table 4 below, data from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics show that new court commitments to state prison
increased by 155 percent from 1980 to 1992. A breakdown of this
increase, though, shows that violent offenders accounted for only
16 percent of this increase, with the remaining 84 percent being
due to increased incarceration of drug and property offenders and
persons convicted of public order offenses. Thus, while it may be
true that part of the explanation for high incarceration rates in
the U.S. is due to higher rates of violent crime, this is clearly
not the primary factor behind the unprecedented increase in the
prison population that we have seen in recent years.<br>

<p> <u>Are Sentencing Policies in the U.S. Harsher Than in Other
Nations? <br>
</u>Another way to explore this issue is to examine relative
sentences in different nations for convicted offenders. Those who
contend that the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. is
primarily a product of high crime rates suggest that a comparison
of sentencing policies is necessary in order to ascertain whether
the U.S. is more punitive than other nations on a per crime
basis. The evidence on this issue is somewhat mixed, but does not
necessarily support the contention that high crime rates are the
sole explanation for the high rate of incarceration in the U.S.<br>
A 1987 study conducted by the Justice Department examined
imprisonment decisions for the crimes of burglary, robbery, and
theft in the U.S. compared with Canada, England, and the former
West Germany. The study found that the chances of receiving a
prison term for an arrest on these offenses was roughly
comparable in the U.S., Canada, and England, but lower,
particularly for theft, in West Germany. A key issue that was not
addressed in the study, though, was comparative length of
sentence. It is possible, for example, that while convicted
offenders in the U.S. are <u>sentenced to prison</u> at
comparable rates to these two other nations, <u>sentence lengths</u>
in the U.S. may be longer or shorter than in other countries.<br>
In fact, European comparisons by Young and Brown found that
sentence length was in fact a more critical variable than prison
admissions in determining prison populations. In looking at the
Netherlands and Sweden, both of which have low rates of
incarceration, they concluded that the rate of sentencing to
prisons was comparable to other nations, but that shorter average
sentences accounted for the difference in incarceration rates.<br>
One of the few studies that have attempted to compare the U.S.
with other nations, although with some methodological
limitations, came to the conclusion that U.S. sentencing
practices were in fact more severe. In an examination of
sentencing practices in the U.S. and France, Richard Frase looked
at whether crime rates, and particularly violent crime, could
explain the substantial difference in incarceration rates between
the two nations. His conclusion was that even controlling for
differences in crime rates, American sentencing severity the use
of prison as a sentence and the length of prison sentences was
almost twice as high as in France. (By a somewhat more
conservative estimation technique, Frase still estimated that
American sentencing severity was about 50 percent greater than in
France.)<br>
One limitation of the U.S. studies is that they analyze data from
the early 1980s. Sentencing patterns in the U.S. have changed
substantially since that time, with there now being a greater
likelihood of incarceration for many offenses. Bureau of Justice
Statistics data show that for every 1,000 arrests, the commitment
rate to state prison has increased by 6 percent for robbery, 29
percent for aggravated assault, 49 percent for burglary, and
fully 447 percent for drugs from 1980 to 1992. For drug offenses
in particular, the length of imprisonment is also increasing in
many jurisdictions due to the impact of mandatory sentencing
laws. While we do not have data describing sentencing trends in
other nations during this period, the changes in U.S. drug policy
in particular suggest that the incarceration differential with
other nations may continue to increase for some period of time.<br>
<u>A Cross-National Look at Sentence Length<br>
</u>If in fact sentence length is a key variable in understanding
relative rates of incarceration, then the question is why
different nations impose varying degrees of sentence length on
offenders. Recent research in this area, analyzed by Warren Young
and Mark Brown, provides some provocative conclusions. After
reviewing explanations for harsher sentencing policies that look
at issues such as unemployment rates and public policy decisions,
they conclude that these do not provide sufficient correlations
for crossnational distinctions. They find instead that the most
substantial explanation lies in the cultural attitudes of a
society; that is, what most people would consider the
&quot;right&quot; punishment.<br>
Attitudes toward punishment tend to be shared within a society
and affect decisionmaking regarding the harshness of sentencing.
But why are some nations more punitive than others? Research by
Wilkins and Pease suggests that &quot;a society's penal climate
or its relative punitiveness is linked to its relative
egalitarianism: the greater a society's tolerance of inequality,
the more extreme the scale of punishment utilized.&quot; Thus,
sentencing severity is a type of negative reward for those at one
end of the spectrum, compared to the positive rewards of income
and status. A society like the United States, therefore, premised
on a strong degree of individualism and with greater disparity of
wealth than most industrialized nations, will be more likely to
display harsher cultural attitudes toward sentencing policy than
a nation with a broader social welfare system.<br>
The implications of this analysis are quite profound, for it
suggests that changes in criminal justice policy alone will not
eliminate the differential in international rates of
incarceration. This is not to deny the importance of changes in
criminal justice policy, which can have a significant impact for
sentencing of many offenders. The analysis tells us, though, that
if a society is committed to lowering its rate of incarceration,
either on fiscal or moral grounds, an overall reevaluation of
cultural attitudes and values that determine sentencing policy
needs to be initiated.<br>
<u>Summary: Toward an Understanding of Crime and Incarceration <br>
</u>What can we conclude from this assessment of crime rates and
incarceration? Several key themes emerge:<br>
1. Crime rates for most property crimes and some assaultive
offenses in the U.S. are not significantly greater than for other
industrialized nations, and therefore are not a major explanation
for the high rate of incarceration in the U.S.<br>
2. Higher rates of violent crime in the U.S. are responsible for
at least part of the nation's high incarceration rate compared to
other nations. The dramatic increase in the prison population
since 1980, though, was not primarily a result of sentencing
greater numbers of violent offenders, since violent offenders
represented only 16 percent of the increase in court commitments
from 1980 to 1992.<br>
3. The impact of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; has been
responsible for much of the increase in the prison population,
with 46 percent of new court commitments since 1980 being due to
drug offenses. <br>
4. Crossnational comparisons of rates of incarceration suggest
that the length of prison sentences, rather than the number of
persons sentenced to prison is the main determinant of differing
rates of incarceration. Thus, alternatives to incarceration may
have some impact on lowering a jurisdiction's incarceration rate,
but this will generally be of less magnitude than altering
sentence lengths.<br>
5. Once prisons are built, they are in many respects a
selfperpetuating entity. Prisons are constructed to last for
50100 years and their continued use over time contributes to a
culture that makes their use seem logical and rational. While few
persons would argue with the necessity for a certain level of
imprisonment in society, it is far from clear that incarceration
is the only, or best, means of either preventing or controlling
crime. A broad range of policies both within and outside the
criminal justice system exist to accomplish these objectives, and
different nations make use of these resources to varying degrees.
Unless incarceration is examined in this context, policymakers
will be confronted with a set of crime control options that is
much more restrictive than necessary.<br>
<b>WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF INCREASED INCARCERATION ON CRIME? <br>
</b>While there are a variety of reasons why judges sentence
offenders to prison, the underlying goal is to reduce crime,
whether accomplished through incapacitation, deterrence, or
rehabilitation in prison. Given the enormous increase in the use
of imprisonment in the past two decades, along with heightened
public concern about crime, it is critical to examine the effect
these policies have had on public safety.<br>
There is a small body of opinion, generally represented by the
National Rifle Association and its allies, that contends that the
prison buildup of the 1980s had a dramatic effect on crime rates
and that &quot;Incarceration works.&quot; This assertion turns
out to be based on serious distortions of criminal justice data.
The NRA claims, for example, that the 150 percent increase in
incarceration from 1980 to 1991 led to a 24 percent drop in
&quot;serious victimization.&quot; Upon closer examination,
however, the NRA definition of &quot;serious victimization&quot;
includes violent crimes, but also the nonviolent crime of
burglary, one of the FBI's seven Index offenses. While burglary
rates did decline during the 1980s their inclusion with violent
crimes distorts actual trends. Had the NRA included the Index
offense of auto theft rather than burglary in its calculations,
the results would have been very different, since auto theft
victimization increased by 33 percent during this period. Looking
only at violent crime, we find that the more than doubling of the
prison population paralleled a 4 percent decline in violent crime
during this period.<br>
The &quot;relationship&quot; claimed by the NRA also turns out to
be one that is not consistent over time. By breaking down crime
and incarceration into two periods, 198086 and 198691, as seen
below in Tables 5 and 6, we find that incarceration rates rose by
65 percent and violent crime declined by 16 percent in the first
period, but that from 1986 to 1991, despite the fact that
imprisonment rose 51 percent, violent crime also increased, by 15
percent. Clearly, no cause and effect relationship can be
discerned here.<br>

<p> * Murder rates, reported by the FBI per 100,000, are shown to
three decimal places in order to observe trends.<br>
What about crime rates overall, though, in addition to violent
crime? Here, too, we see no consistent impact. Some crimes, such
as burglary and larceny, have declined steadily since 1980.
Others, such as auto theft, have increased significantly. One
measure of crime's impact on society is the financial harm
suffered by victims. In this regard, the increase in auto theft
has been far more costly, since the median loss to victims
($3,600) is substantially greater than for victims of burglary or
larceny ($50 and $55 respectively). Again, any overall positive
gains in crime control are difficult to discern.<br>
More sophisticated studies, such as those of Patrick A. Langan,
have attempted to look at this issue as well, and have suggested
that increased incarceration may have had some impact on crime
rates. Yet in a comparative study of the use of incarceration in
England and the United States he concludes that &quot;Existing
evidence does not suggest that crime can be dramatically reduced
simply by putting more offenders behind bars,&quot; and that
&quot;modest reductions in crime may be possible, but major and
lasting reductions probably will require social intervention
techniques, such as parent training or preschool intellectual
enrichment programs.&quot; <br>
Two other issues bear on this relationship as well. First, as we
have noted in previous reports, demographic issues play a
significant role in crime rates, since young males produce
disproportionately high rates of crime. As criminologists Darrell
Steffensmeier and Miles Harer have noted, most of the change in
crime rates in the period 198088 can be explained by changes in
the proportion of the population in the age group 1524. <br>
Second, the impact of drug crimes and arrests adds another
dimension to this analysis, since drug offenses are not covered
as part of the FBI's <u>Uniform Crime Reports</u>, or what is
generally described as the &quot;crime rate.&quot; Since there
are no data on the number of drug crimes that are committed, we
can only look to statistics on drug arrests for general trends,
where we find that drug arrests doubled during the 1980s. Some
experts have speculated that the decline in some offenses such as
burglary during this period may represent a shift in crime
patterns from burglary to lowlevel drug dealing, and not
necessarily an overall reduction in criminal activity.<br>
Finally, some advocates of increased incarceration contend that
had the large buildup of the prison population not taken place,
crime rates would have been even higher than they already are.
This type of speculation can be neither proved nor disproved, but
if one believes that crime would have increased, then there must
have been some specific factors causing this. They may have
included poverty, drug abuse, poor education, and family
breakdown, among others. Addressing these problems should have
more of an impact on crime than continuing to expand the prison
population. <br>
<b>WHY HASN'T INCARCERATION HAD MORE IMPACT ON CRIME?<br>
</b>Common sense would tell us that locking up offenders should
have an impact on crime. Certainly, some offenders are
incapacitated or deterred through incarceration. What seems
surprising at first, though, is the relatively limited nature of
this impact, particularly given the massive use of incarceration
in the United States. An examination of three key issues in
demographics and criminal justice processing, though, reveals why
the prison system has such a modest impact on crime:<br>
1. <u>The &quot;Criminal Justice Funnel&quot;<br>
</u>First, the criminal justice system operates as a
&quot;funnel.&quot; At the top of the funnel are all the crimes
that are committed, and at the bottom, the number of offenders
sentenced to prison. The slope of the funnel is quite steep since
for many offenses, the crime is never reported to the police, an
arrest is not made, a conviction is not obtained, or an offender
is not sentenced to prison. Generally, fewer than 3 percent of
all serious crimes result in a prison sentence.<br>
One unknown variable is the fact that some convicted offenders
have committed additional crimes which have gone undetected.
Incarcerating these offenders therefore responds to more than
just the single crime of conviction. Yet even if we multiply the
3 percent figure by a factor of five or ten, it is clear that the
system is still only able to use incarceration for a relative
handful of serious offenses.<br>
2. <u>The Impact of Demographics<br>
</u>The prison system is also limited by the impact of
demographics; in particular the fact that a disproportionate
number of crimes is committed by 1518 yearold males. For the
crimes of burglary, robbery, and assault, for example, the peak
age of crime commission is 18. Within six years, these rates are
half their peak. This &quot;aging out&quot; of crime phenomenon
has two implications for policy: 1) for each succeeding year that
offenders are locked up in prison, fewer crimes are being
prevented than the year before; and, 2) unless the factors
leading to high crime rates in the 1518 year age range are
addressed, incarceration will remain an &quot;after the
fact&quot; response that fails to address the new annual cohort
of potential offenders.<br>
3. <u>The &quot;Replacement&quot; Effect<br>
</u>Finally, the &quot;replacement&quot; effect of crime
commission limits the utility of incarceration as a means of
crime control. As we have seen most clearly for drug offenses,
the massive increase in the use of imprisonment for drug
offenders in the 1980s had little discernible impact on drug
abuse or drug crimes. As long as a market exists for drugs, new
potential sellers will emerge to take the place of those who are
locked up.<br>
<b>WHY ARE AFRICANAMERICAN MALES INCARCERATED AT SUCH HIGH RATES?
<br>
</b>We and others have documented the dramatically high rate of
incarceration and criminal justice supervision of AfricanAmerican
males. As can be seen in the table below, the number of
incarcerated black males exceeds the number of black males
enrolled in higher education. This is clearly a sign of a
longterm crisis in the making for both the black community and
the nation.<br>

In recent years, the plight of AfricanAmerican males has been the
subject of much discussion. A 1990 report of The Sentencing
Project documenting that one in four young black men was under
some form of criminal justice control received widespread
national attention. A variety of activities have been undertaken
to both study these issues and to address them programmatically.
These have included Congressional hearings, the formation of task
forces, communitybased programs, and others. Despite this level
of activity, though, the number of incarcerated AfricanAmerican
males has increased from 499,000 in 1990 to 583,000 by 1992-93.<br>
An analysis of the causes of this distressing situation is
complex. An examination of recent trends, though, points to both
social policy factors and criminal justice policies that relate
directly to this problem.<br>
One of the key issues facing the nation today is the problem of
youth violence, an area in which AfricanAmerican males are
overrepresented both as victims and perpetrators. Research in
this area by criminologist Delbert Elliott indicates a number of
directions in which social policy plays a significant role in
producing differential outcomes by race.<br>
Elliott's review of comparative rates of youth violence finds
that rates of violence are high overall and that they cut across
racial and class lines. Youth selfreport studies show that for
1617 year old males, 2025 percent of the population report having
engaged in &quot;serious violent offending,&quot; defined as
aggravated assault, forcible rape, robbery, and homicide. Racial
differences are relatively modest by age 18, the rate of reported
violent offending among blacks is only 18 percent higher than for
whites. <br>
After the teen years, two trends emerge. First, the vast majority
of violent youth cease their involvement within a few years of
its onset. Of those youth who were engaged in violent behavior as
teens, nearly 80 percent report discontinuing such behavior by
their twenties.<br>
For black youth, though, nearly twice as many persist in their
violent offending after age 21. The one significant exception to
this pattern, though, is among those males who are employed.
Within this group, there are no discernible differences by race. <br>
Elliott concludes that the key to reducing adolescent violent
behavior lies in enabling these individuals to make a successful
transition to the adult roles of work, marriage, and parenting.
He finds that:<br>
...race and class differences in serious violent offending are
small during adolescence, but become substantial during the early
adult years. This difference does not appear to be the result of
differences in predispositions to violence, but in the continuity
of violence once initiated. Race, in particular, is related to
finding and holding a job, and to marriage and stable cohabiting
rates. In essence, race and poverty are related to successfully
making the transition out of adolescence and into adult roles.<br>
While incarceration may be necessary to respond to certain
violent behaviors, its role in enabling young offenders to make
the transition to work and family is virtually nonexistent. For
middle class youth who have access to resources, this transition
is far more likely to take place successfully with or without any
intervention by the criminal justice system.<br>
Compounding these problems in the larger community and economy
are criminal justice policies of recent years which have further
marginalized AfricanAmerican young males. As we have noted
previously, the &quot;war on drugs&quot; in particular has played
a substantial role in exacerbating the continuously increasing
rates of incarceration. The other major outcome of this
&quot;war&quot; has been to increase the already substantial
disparity in incarceration suffered by AfricanAmericans.<br>
<b>THE NEW &quot;LAW AND ORDER&quot; CLIMATE<br>
</b>A visitor from another planet might be forgiven for being
utterly confused about the direction of American criminal justice
policy. The observer would first note that two decades of
steadily increasing rates of incarceration had not resulted in
any Americans feeling safer from crime. He or she might
understandably then believe that a reconsideration of
incarceration policies would be in order.<br>
Looking at activities in Congress and state legislatures, though,
it is clear that little of this is taking place. Congress and at
least a dozen states have passed &quot;Three Strikes and You're
Out&quot; laws mandating life without parole for certain
threetime offenders. Despite rising costs of corrections, prison
construction continues almost unabated in most parts of the
country. And, public opinion polls show substantially heightened
concern about crime along with support for various restrictive
sentencing policies. <br>
How does one explain this seeming inconsistency between reality
and public policy? Many criminal justice observers have noted the
fact that fear of crime appears to be increasing even as crime
rates remain about the same as ten years ago. Several factors
explain this:<br>
1. <u>Crime rates compared to what?</u> While it is true that
crime rates are about the same as ten years ago, they are
significantly higher than thirty years ago. Therefore, most
adults can remember a time in their early life when they felt,
and were, significantly safer than they are today. So, whether
crime is up a little or down a little from year to year, there is
an understandably greater concern about its impact on daily life.<br>
A second issue in this area regards the distinction between crime
<u>rates</u> the proportion of crime for a given population and
the actual <u>number</u> of crimes. When one reads news accounts
of cities experiencing record <u>numbers</u> of murders, for
example, it is often the case that the <u>rate</u> of murder is
lower than in previous years. While the murder rate in the U.S.
is clearly intolerably high, distortions such as this only
contribute to misperceptions and a heightened climate of fear.<br>
2. <u>Media access and sensationalism</u>. Public policy in the
area of crime control has for a long time been overly influenced
by a relative handful of sensational events. The Willie Horton
issue of the 1988 Presidential campaign was one of the most
prominent examples, along with more recent events such as the
1993 tragic murder of 12year old Polly Klaas in California and
the killings on the Long Island RailRoad commuter train. Atypical
as these events may be, they create a distorted perception of the
actual risks of violent crime.<br>
Another factor in this area is the broader variety of media
outlets that now exist and the more sensational forms of
reporting engaged in by many of them. The police highway tracking
of O.J. Simpson and his subsequent court appearances illustrate
ways in which violent crime comes into the American home in a
much more direct way than in the past.<br>
3. <u>Political grandstanding</u>. One of the more significant
political developments on crime policy in recent years is that
under the Clinton administration, the Democrats have tried to
&quot;take the crime issue away&quot; from Republicans. Public
opinion polls show this strategy to have been largely successful,
with more respondents indicating confidence in the Democrats to
control crime.<br>
In large part, though, this has been little more than promoting
the &quot;get tough&quot; approach that the Republican party has
been perceived to offer for many years. The President's support
for &quot;Three Strikes and You're Out&quot; in his State of the
Union message, Congressional support for more prison
construction, and the failure to make any significant inroads on
the issue of mandatory sentencing indicate a willingness to
pursue many of the major policy thrusts of the Reagan/Bush era.<br>
The primary distinction made by the Democratic leadership in
contrast with the past has been the call for a &quot;mix of
punishment and prevention&quot; approach to crime. Few persons
would argue with the need for such a mix in general terms. The
flaw in this approach, though, is that it presupposes that an
&quot;equal&quot; mix of punishment and prevention is what is
called for today. As the history of the past twenty years has
demonstrated, there has been absolutely no reluctance to engage
in punishment, even to the point of becoming a world leader in
the use of incarceration. At the same time, due to budgetary
constraints and a changing political climate, resources devoted
to prevention in a broad sense have declined in many respects.<br>
Therefore, if a mix of punishment and prevention is what is
actually needed, policymakers should begin to assess how to
achieve that mix. Clearly, an emphasis on &quot;frontend&quot;
preventive approaches and a decreased emphasis on
&quot;backend&quot; reactive approaches should be pursued if the
nation is to reach a balance between punishment and prevention.<br>
4. <u>Intersection of race and crime</u>. One of the defining
issues of American criminal justice policy for many years has
been the equation of crime with AfricanAmerican males. The
dynamics of this phenomenon are complex, but they center around
the vicious cycle that has been created in the national
consciousness.<br>
For violent offenses in particular, AfricanAmerican male rates of
offending are considerably higher than for other groups. This
fact is then portrayed in frequent media depictions of young
black men as criminals, which lends support to policies designed
to incarcerate ever larger numbers of them. Rarely in this
process is any attempt made to understand how a 15year old youth
has become a school dropout who is selling drugs and carrying a
gun, or what types of family and community responses might have
prevented these developments. Few middle class families would
willfully hand over their teenage children to the criminal
justice system for punishment or rehabilitation, yet
AfricanAmerican males are processed into the system in historic
numbers with little questioning by the larger community.<br>
Lost in the process as well is the fact that for some offenses,
AfricanAmericans are disproportionately represented in the
criminal justice system even though their rates of crime
commission are not responsible for the disparities. The
sentencing disparities between powder cocaine and crack cocaine
have been well documented, showing that punishments for these two
forms of the same drug are correlated with the race of the user
in large part.<br>
Finally, by looking only at prison populations for sources of
disparity, we miss key aspects of the potential sources of
disparity. For example, within the category of violent offenses,
AfricanAmericans arrest rates are approximately the same as the
proportion of AfricanAmericans in prison. If one were to look at
white collar or corporate crimes, though, two issues would
emerge. First, we would find that AfricanAmericans are
underrepresented as offenders, and second, that the system has
historically put fewer resources into prosecuting these types of
crimes. Thus, decisions regarding criminal justice priorities
play a role in determining the composition of prison populations
regardless of particular crime rates.<br>
<b>The Impact of the New &quot;Law and Order&quot; Movement<br>
</b>It is still too early to project the full impact of the
various sentencing policies that have been adopted or are under
consideration at the national and state level. Much of the impact
will depend on how broadly the various proposals are crafted, and
how they are implemented in practice. It is already clear,
though, that the new &quot;get tough&quot; movement has been
successful in producing a variety of harsh sentencing proposals,
most notably, the &quot;Three Strikes and You're Out&quot;
proposals.<br>
The impact of these proposals will be felt in both fiscal terms
and potential disruptions to components of the criminal justice
system. Much of this can be seen most clearly in the California
legislation, which is by far the broadest to date. In addition to
providing life without parole for &quot;threetime losers,&quot;
the California statutes also increase sentences for a broad range
of offenses. The Department of Corrections has estimated that the
legislation will lead to an increase of 275,000 in the prison
population over the next thirty years, with an additional
operating cost of $5.7 billion annually. Further, the legislation
will necessitate an additional $21 billion in prison construction
costs. <br>
The impact of &quot;3 Strikes&quot; laws has already been
observed at trials and sentencing in a number of states:<br>
 One of the first offenders sentenced under the Washington
state law was 35year old Larry Fisher, whose third strike
involved robbing a sandwich shop of $151 by pretending that the
finger in his pocket was a gun. His previous two strikes involved
pushing his grandfather down and taking $390 from him, and a $100
pizza parlor robbery that also did not involve a weapon. <br>
 In the case of the first defendant to be tried in San
Francisco under the state's new law, the 71year old victim whose
car had been burglarized refused to testify in court because she
viewed the penalty as far too severe.<br>
 In the first case to be tried in Los Angeles, jurors
deadlocked on a routine burglary charge, reportedly because three
jurors believed life in prison was an overly harsh penalty for a
nonviolent crime.<br>
The new generation of harsh sentencing policies will also have
several lasting impacts: 1) prison construction required as a
result of their implementation will represent a commitment to use
of these institutions for at least fifty years; 2) funds diverted
to increased costs of corrections will not be available to
address a variety of crime prevention measures; 3) the already
tragic levels of incarceration for African-Americans males will
be increased; and, 4) political debate on crime will be further
stifled and more focused on a narrow range of sentencing
policies.<br>
The ultimate measure of these proposals, of course, is their
impact on crime. In this area, too, there is no reason to believe
that these proposals will be effective. The demographics of crime
commission show us that incarcerating a 50- or 60year old
offender is an extremely expensive means for preventing very few
crimes. Rather than providing more resources to prevention and a
more effective juvenile justice system, funding will be diverted
to the creation of geriatric prisons that will hurt taxpayers
financially but not provide them with any increased public
safety.<br>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A MORE RATIONAL CRIME POLICY<br>
</b>The analysis of crime and incarceration described in this
report tells us that the high rate of incarceration in the United
States is not solely a product of higher rates of crime than
other nations, nor has it achieved a substantial impact on
reducing crime. Despite a quadrupling of the inmate population
since 1973, Americans do not feel safer from crime and are still
victimized by high rates of crime and violence.<br>
We have no illusions that the current tough climate on crime
control policies will recede in the near future. Too many
senseless crimes combined with too much media sensationalism and
political grandstanding have created an emotional and politicized
atmosphere that makes rational discussion of crime control
policies exceedingly difficult. <br>
Nevertheless, there remain many professionals and others who care
about the crime problem and are genuinely searching for
constructive responses. In addition, numerous public opinion
surveys have documented that the public is far more responsive to
a broad range of solutions to crime than is commonly assumed. The
problem is that the range of choices generally presented in
public policy discussions is exceedingly narrow.<br>
In previous reports, we have suggested policy changes that could
have an impact on rates of incarceration while providing more
appropriate sanctions and services to offenders. These include: <br>
톀epealing mandatory sentencing laws in order to restore
appropriate judicial discretion;<br>
톂reating the drug problem primarily as a public health problem
rather than as a criminal justice problem;<br>
톁upporting the expansion of a broader range of alternatives to
incarceration to provide judges and communities with viable
community based sentencing options;<br>
텲stablishing a national commission to examine the high rate of
incarceration in the U.S., and of African American males in
particular.<br>
These and other policy changes would begin to control the
spiralling rate of incarceration and associated costs.
Implementing these policies, though, is a political problem, one
in which there has been relatively little constructive
leadership. It is far from certain that the political climate on
crime can be altered significantly in the short run. If it is to
change in the long run, though, a framework such as the following
needs to be presented:<br>
1. No &quot;anticrime&quot; proposals enacted today whether
prison construction or prevention programs will have much impact
on crime in the next several years. It is far more important to
look toward the generation of youth being born today and to
develop policies that will reduce their chances of becoming
offenders as they reach their teen years.<br>
2. The criminal justice system, as a reactive system, can only
have a limited impact on crime. While a system of justice and
sanctions is necessary, we should not look to the courts and
prisons as the primary means of controlling or preventing crime.<br>
3. Crime is a product of many factors, including individual,
family, and community issues. Only an understanding of the
complexity of these factors will enable us to develop a
comprehensive strategy for responding to the problem.<br>
For too long, public debate on crime has been polarized and
stifling. As a result, we are faced with the problems of
continuing high rates of crime, increasing rates of
incarceration, and continuing public dissatisfaction. After
twenty years of &quot;getting tough,&quot; it is hard to imagine
how new &quot;tough&quot; proposals will succeed any better than
their predecessors. It is time to publicly acknowledge this
crisis and to initiate a more honest and open debate about the
pressing problem of crime.<br>
<b>METHODOLOGY FOR PRISONER DATA<br>
</b><u>United States</u> Data are for the years 199293 (the most
recent available), and were derived from Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) reports detailing the number of prison inmates
on December 31, 1993 and the number of jail inmates on June 30,
1992. From the total inmate figure, we excluded 2,804 juveniles
being held in local jails as well as 50,966 inmates under federal
or state jurisdiction who were being held in local jails, so as
to avoid duplication with the jail count.<br>
To calculate the racial composition of the state and federal
inmate population, we used the figures of 47.9 percent black and
46.8 percent white from <u>Correctional Populations in the United
States</u>, 1991 (BJS). The racial composition of jail inmates
was derived in two steps. We first used the figures of 44.1
percent black and 40.1 percent white nonHispanic from the 1992
jail report. We then estimated the portion of the Hispanic
population (14.5 percent of jail inmates) by race, using Census
Bureau estimates that the Hispanic population nationally is 95
percent white, 2 percent black, and 2 percent other. Male inmate
populations were calculated by race by using the 1991 proportions
for state and federal inmates and the 1992 overall data for
jails. All racial data represent a small undercount, since data
on race are not available for approximately 4 percent of state
and federal inmates. Overall population data were taken from
Census Bureau estimates for 1993.<br>
A small margin of error is inevitable in these calculations. It
is possible, for example, that the racial composition of the
Hispanic inmate population is different than for the population
as a whole. There is no reason to believe, though, that the
overall inmate population estimates are off by a substantial
margin.<br>
<u>Other Nations</u> Sources for prisoner data include Human
Rights Watch, Penal Reform International, Australian Institute of
Criminology, <u>Corrections Compendium</u>, and Professor Nils
Christie. Data for Asian counties are all for 1993; for Europe
and other continents, data are for either 1992 or 1993.<br>
Data for Russia are taken from three sources. The most current is
from a report of a lecture given by the General Director of the
Russian Prison System, as described by Nils Christie of the
University of Oslo in the 1994 edition of <u>Crime Control as
Industry</u>, documenting a total of 848,000 inmates. An April
1993 article by Gary Hill appearing in <u>Corrections Compendium</u>
cites almost identical figures (845,000), and the State
Department's <u>County Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993</u>
lists the prison population as 827,000. We have used Christie's
figure as the most current, and from it have deducted the 19,000
juveniles reported by Hill, so as to be comparable to the U.S.
calculations. <br>
The South African figures are taken from the 1993 report of the
South African Prisons Service. The South African categories of
&quot;black&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; are combined to produce
the black male rate of incarceration. In previous reports, we
have attempted to estimate the incarceration rate for the four
&quot;independent&quot; homelands that were not recognized by any
nation outside South Africa. This estimate was then incorporated
into the overall figures for South Africa to derive a rate of
incarceration. Since there are no current reliable figures for
these homelands for 1993, we have not included them in either the
prison data or the overall population data for South Africa.
Therefore, the incarceration rates reported here are not entirely
comparable to those of past reports. Since the homelands are now
officially part of South Africa, we hope that in future reports
data will be available for the entire population.<br>
Although previous reports included data for China, there are no
current data that are considered reliable by most observers.<br>
