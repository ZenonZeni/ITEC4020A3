(1) CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT COALITION REQUEST FOR INJUNCTION OF CDA

The Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition Friday (3/1) filed a motion for
a preliminary injunction of the Communications Decency Act.  The filing
sets the stage for an historic court battle which will determine the future
of the Internet as a viable means for free expression, education, and
commerce, as well as the fate of the First Amendment in the information
age.  Witnesses will begin to testify before the Philadelphia Federal court
beginning March 21, 1996.

The Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) is coordinated by the
Center for Democracy and Technology, America Online, the American Library
Association, and others, including People for the American Way.  Its 37
members include over 5000 individual Internet users, libraries, book
publishers, newspaper publishers, editors, advertisers, commercial online
service providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, and civil liberties advocates.

Individual Internet users are encouraged to join the fight! All users of
the Internet are potentially subject to massive fines and prison sentences
under the Communications Decency Act.  Join the CIEC and become a part of a
landmark case which will determine the future of  free speech online.

Over 5000 individuals have joined as of 5:30 pm Friday 3/1! For more
information, on what you can do to help overturn the CDA,  please visit the
CIEC web page at:

http://www.cdt.org/ciec/

You must join by March 15, so please hurry!

The text of the CIEC complaint and other relevant information is currently
available on the CIEC web page. Copies of today's motion, along with the
declarations listed below, will be available on the CIEC page shortly.

THE INTERNET IS A UNIQUE COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WHICH DESERVES FULL
FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS

In the motion filed today, CIEC argues that the Internet is a unique
communications technology distinct from traditional broadcast mass media
and telephone networks, and that the broad content regulations imposed by
the CDA are unconstitutionally restrictive.  The CIEC argues that because
the Internet offers users tremendous control over the content they receive,
it deserves first amendment protections at least as broad as those enjoyed
by the print medium.  Specifically, the motion states:

  &quot;The Internet, and 'cyberspace' generally, is an entirely new
   communications medium that differs from other media in crucial
   respects: it is global, it is decentralized, it gives ordinary
   citizens unparalleled ability to communicate to and with others on a
   scale never before possible, an it is unobtrusive, because users
   access only the communications they affirmatively request. It
   therefor merits the highest level of First Amendment protection.&quot;
   (Page 2)

The motion goes on to argue:

  &quot;In sum, this Court should accord to the interactive computer medium
  the most vigilant protection from government censorship and
  overreaching.  The unparalleled potential of cyberspace to effectuate
  the core policies of the First Amendment calls for a reaffirmance of
  our 'profound national commitment' to public discourse that is
  'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.&quot;

  &quot;The challenged provisions of the Act, however, represent an
  indiscriminate and damaging retreat from that commitment, one that
  reflects an as-yet poor legislative understanding even of the basic
  operating methods  of cyberpsace.  Those provisions are facially
  invalid because they abridge far too much protected speech while
  affording little incremental protection for minors, and threaten to
  disrupt the rapidly unfolding development of a salutary communications
  revolution that until now has flourished with a minimum of
  governmental interference.&quot; (Pages 60 - 61).


OVER 39 DECLARATIONS DESCRIBE THE INTERNET AND THE IMPACT OF THE CDA.

libraries, online service providers, content providers, publishers,
non-profit groups, civil liberties advocates, and even a US Senator.  The

their rights to free speech on the Internet, and will be considered by the
court as evidence in the case.  The list of groups filing declarations
