Each year at the "Yes I Can!" awards, CEC and the Foundation for Exceptional Children (FEC) recognizes students whose courage and determination have helped them achieve despite their disabilities. <P>Established in 1981, the Yes I Can! awards help students with disabilities know that their efforts are appreciated and that they, too, can be recognized for their accomplishments. Each year 35 students are selected for the international awards, which are presented at a special ceremony and reception at the annual convention. In addition, <EM>all</EM> nominees receive a certificate for their achievements.<p>
Do you know of a student who deserves recognition? If so, nominate them for a Yes I Can! award. These students bring pride and hope to the entire special education community.<p>
Nominees for the Yes I Can! award must be 2 to 21 years old. Each nominee is eligible in <STRONG>one</STRONG> category. For more information, contact FEC at 703/620-1054, or jump to the <A HREF="/fd/96yicapp.htm">Yes I Can! web page</A>.
