<H3>COMMERCIALIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (CAP)
</H3>
This program is designed for groups of up the 100 companies and is typically sponsored by an organization with a vested interest in the success of the companies. Dawnbreaker has conducted this program on 5 ocassions for the U.S. Department of Energy. Participating companies are those which  have received Phase II  R&D funding through the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR).<P>

The purpose of the CAP is to speed up the rate of successful commercialization of R&D. This is accomplished via a process which contains the following components:<P>
