<P><B><font color=brown>SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS</font></B><BR>

<B>David Guterson</B> (Vintage $12.00)

<P>The Buzz among independents for this Good Read began in 1994, when booksellers were first introduced to this compelling story of a Pacific Northwest fishing town's reaction to its Japanese-American citizens at the outbreal of WWII and a murder trial following the war that lays bare old wounds. Independent bookstores love discovering a gem like<B> Snow Falling on Cedars </B>and sharing their enthusiasm, with customers, and they've done it with these other featured titles.

<B>Nicholas Christopher </B> (Dial Press $22.95)

<P>This is a novel that perhaps only a poet could write.

The reader cannot but help but be seduced by his power as a storyteller.

<B>Oliver Sacks</B> (Vintage $13.00)

<P>In seven true tales, Dr. Sacks continues his exploration of human beings with neurological disorders, offering case histories that read like novellas. The joy of this compassionate work is that we are made to see the person and not the disorder. While these are "deeply altered selves," they are also extraordinary doors to alternate ways of perceiving the self."
