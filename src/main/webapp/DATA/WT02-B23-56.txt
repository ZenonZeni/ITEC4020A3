This 17-foot female great white shark weighing 4,000 lbs. became entangled in swordfish nets in southern <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="shark.gif" ALT="[photo of shark]">California waters September 21, 1994 and died before fishermen were able to set it free. Joe Caruso, skipper of the 42-foot F/V Horizon, had set the float net on a  Saturday evening in waters 15 miles west of Santa Monica Bay. When he and his deck hand Loc Huynh checked the net early Sunday morning, they were astonished. <P>
	"We thought we were pulling up a huge swordfish," Caruso told the Press-Telegram of Long Beach." Sadly, despite the fishermen's nearly day-long effort to free their catch, the huge fish died. Caruso then towed the fish back to port, docking Sunday evening at Long Beach's Terminal Island. <P>
	Mike Schaadt of the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and one of the researchers who examined the fish reported the specimen was one of the largest ever seen in local waters. Researchers dissecting the creature found in the shark's stomach a 300 lb. sea lion and a 4-foot-long six-gilled shark. Parts of the shark were taken for delivery to shark experts while the liver, which weighed 1,086 lbs. was destined for pet food. <P>
	Skipper Caruso told the Press-Telegram that while they were out on the fishing grounds trying to free the shark, the sea lions in the area appeared to be thrilled by the sight of the dying fish tangled in the nets . "They were very excited and started making love to either other, kissing and whatever," he said. [Photo by  Branimir Kvartuc] <BR>

<B>Chip log -</B> A block of wood tied to a length of line and used in the earliest days of sail to measure speed and distance traveled. The chip log was dropped off the stern and the line, which was knotted at  regular intervals, was allowed to pay out. A sand glass was used to time the amount of knots run out (hence the term knots). The information was recorded into the vessel's logbook. Hence the origin of the verb "to log," and, most recently the computer term "to log on."<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

Scientists writing in the British journal Nature reported that the deep submersible Alvin, while exploring deep sea hydrothermal vents at a depth of 8,000 feet along a volcanic ridge in the Eastern Pacific, 500 miles west of Central America, videotaped two large octopi engaged in copulatory behavior. Subsequent study of the tape revealed that the critters were not only of different species but that both were male. One observer commented: 'Well, it is very dark down there.<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
