Kyodo to change its English corporate name+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Kyodo News Service said Monday its English corporate name will
be changed to Kyodo News, effective from Jan. 1.
     The news agency said the decision came to coincide with the 50th
anniversary of its foundation in 1945.  The Japanese name Kyodo
Tsushinsha will remain unchanged.
     The group's business arm, K.K. Kyodo News Service, will also
change its English name to K.K. Kyodo News.
     Of the group's three U.S. subsidiaries, the change applies only
to Kyodo News Service U.S.A. Inc., which will now be known as Kyodo
News America Inc.  The two others, Kyodo News California Inc. and
Kyodo News International Inc. will remain intact.

MITI to develop sophisticated enciphering technology+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Tuesday
it will develop sophisticated enciphering technology to meet the
requirements of an advanced information age.
     Research and development institutions affiliated with
universities and enterprises will be commissioned to undertake five
different projects over a two-year period starting Jan. 1, ministry
officials said.
     Cryptographic technologies exclusively for Japanese use are
required to protect private data from plagiarism, they said.
     They said sophisticated coding technology is necessary for the
settlement of transactions via electronic devices.
     The five projects were selected from among 47 candidates
proposed to the ministry this summer, the officials said.

Nintendo to enter Internet business next year+

OSAKA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Nintendo Co., a major maker of home video game machines, plans
to enter Internet business as early as next summer, Nintendo
officials said Tuesday.
     Nintendo is now developing a ''new type of magnetic disk drive''
with 64 megabytes of memory capacity that will complement the
capabilities of its projected home video machine called ''Nintendo
64,'' a company spokesman said.  Nintendo 64 will be marketed
starting next spring.
     On the strength of the new drive, Nintendo President Hiroshi
Yamauchi said the company plans to develop a machine that will enable
users to adjust the details of the prearranged story sequences of
video game software.
     The new 64-megabyte random access memory device will allow the
rewriting of video games and the storing of the rewritten stories,
unlike conventional machines that use read-only memory chips to store
game software, the officials said.
     Yamauchi said the company plans to develop ''a machine that will
allow users to rewrite the contents of a video game just as they want
its story to develop, while allowing users to store the rewritten
stories'' to complement the capabilities of the Nintendo 64 machine.
     Under a linkup agreement between Nintendo and Netscape
Communications Corp. of the United States, the pair are now
developing communication software that would allow users to exchange
such rewritten stories with each other through the Internet, they
said.
     Nintendo hopes to create an international club of fans of
Nintendo video games who would exchange their rewritten video game
stories with each other through the interlinking of the Internet and
the new machines, they said.
