</H3>
What is Glaucoma: Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness, in the United
States, afflicts nearly 2 million Americans, about 60,000 of whom are legally
blind. <BR>
<BR>
Open angle closure glaucoma: In the vast majority of cases this type of
glaucoma is without symptoms. It is associated with mild elevation of intraocular
pressure that produces chronic damage to the optic nerve. Open angle closure
glaucoma is treated medically with drugs that reduce aqueous humor formation.
<BR>
<BR>
Acute angle closure glaucoma: This rare form of the disease, which may include
pain, blurring of vision, halos around lights, etc., is treated with laser
or surgery. <BR>
<BR>
Although elevated intraocular pressure is a common symptom of glaucoma,
nearly 20 percent of those who have the disease do not experience elevated
pressure. For these the traditional screening tests may miss the diagnosis
and, since glaucoma patients &quot;almost never have symptoms,&quot; damage
will continue to progress in their eyes. <BR>
<BR>
Medical treatment for Open Angle Closure Glaucoma: Because the level of
pressure that causes damage varies from person to person a target &quot;normal&quot;
pressure must be determined for each patient and the treatment carefully
adjusted. &quot;Daily variations in pressure complicate the assessment of
treatment, since eyes affected by glaucoma tend to have larger fluctuations
than normal eyes.&quot; (New England Journal of Medicine, 328:1103,1993)
<BR>
<BR>
Prostaglandins:These drugs are being developed to improve aqueous humor
outflow and are believed to &quot;hold much greater promise for the hypotensive
therapy of glaucoma.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Beta blockers: At least four are marketed in the United States and being
used sucessfully in the treatment of intraocular pressure associated with
glaucoma. According to researchers there is &quot;little motivation to develop
new inhibitors of aqueous humor formation since the market is relatively
saturated with such drugs.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the latest scientific evaluation of glaucoma treatment, as reported in
the New England Journal of Medicine, 328:1103,1993, marijuana was not mentioned
as having any role whatsoever. <BR>
<BR>
What about marijuana?: The country's leading ophthalmologists are &quot;chagrined&quot;
and &quot;disturbed&quot; to hear that claims are being made touting marijuana
as a treatment for glaucoma. Because of wide fluctuations in intraocular
pressure, and a numerous other factors which affect the course of this disease,
doctors agree that using marijuana as a treatment is likely to mask problems
and increase the risk of blindness. <BR>
<BR>
William T. Shults, M.D., recognized in the publication &quot;The Best Doctors
in America,&quot; for his work in ophthalmology at the Devers Eye Institute
in Portland, Oregon, noted that alcohol can also lower intraocular pressure
if one has ingested enough to be intoxicated. He added that no one would
propose using alcohol for that purpose, however, because of its many adverse
side effects. Shults stated &quot; I can see no compelling reason whatsoever
for the use of marijuana by patients with glaucoma, and believe that to
propose such a use works a cruel hoax on the public and especially those
with a chronic ocular disease for which many other better treatments are
currently available.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even Judge Francis Young, the DEA administrative judge often quoted by advocates
of medical use of marijuana, stated that he found insufficient evidence
to show that marijuana is an accepted treatment for glaucoma. <BR>
