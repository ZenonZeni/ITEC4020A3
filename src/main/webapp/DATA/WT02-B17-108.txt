<b>Renewable Energy Production and Integrated Storage;<br>

J. Ianucci, Principal Investigator,<br> Distributed Utility

<P>

In this project, we show the technical potential for hydrogen

used as an energy storage medium to couple time-dependent renewable

energy into time-dependent electric utility loads.  This technical

analysis will provide estimates of regional and national opportunities

for hydrogen production, storage, and conversion, based on current

and near-term leading renewable energy and hydrogen production

and storage technologies.  Appropriate renewable technologies

will be matched to their most viable (high-quality and quantity)

regional resources (e.g., examining solar thermal electricity

production in high direct normal insolation areas only).  The

renewables will be assumed to produce electricity which will be

instantaneously used by the local utility to meet its loads; any

excess electricity will be used to produce hydrogen electrolytically

and stored for use later in the day, week or year.  Hydrogen production

from renewables and hydrogen storage use will be derived based

on a range of assumptions of renewable power plant capacity sod

fraction of regional electric load to be met (e.g., the amount

of hydrogen storage required to meet the Northwest region's top

10% of electric load).  Renewable production/utility load hydrogen

storage coupling models will be developed for wind, photovoltaics,

and solar thermal technologies.  Hydro power (which normally has

inherent storage capability) will be analyzed separately.

<P>

Distributed Utility Associates (DUA), with partner Longitude 122

West, Inc. (122 West), will determine the technical potential for

hydrogen production and the need for storage using renewables

as the primary energy source.  For hydroelectric power (which

usually entails its own storage facility), we will do a simple

per annum energy production analysis; for the intermittent renewables

we will simulate the hour-by-hour time dependence of three leading

technologies (wind, photovoltaics, and solar thermal) in appropriate

regions of the United States.  Their electricity production patterns

will be compared with typical regional electric load demand patterns.

 The electric load growth in each region will be projected to

the year 2010.  An assumption of a target renewables energy penetration

will be used to help size the renewables plants to supply that

energy in each year.  The analysis will determine the amount of

hydrogen to be produced and the hydrogen storage capacity required

in each region to meet the mismatch between renewables production

and the electric load pattern using a time-dependent model.  We

will investigate the sensitivity of the answers to the fraction

of peak load to be served and the land area dedicated to renewable

resources.
