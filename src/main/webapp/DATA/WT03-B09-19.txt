Encyclopaedia Britannica Sets Big Plans Following Sale


Expanded programs, richer content and enhanced new media products are among
Encyclopaedia Britannica's future plans under the new ownership of an
investment group led by Swiss investor Jacob Safra.

"The new owner expressed interest in investing in content and technology,"
Joseph Esposito, Encyclopaedia Britannica president and chief executive
officer, told BPR.  He said the sale of the company will not spur any major
changes for the 2,400 Encyclopaedia Britannica employees worldwide.

"The sale has given us the capital to go forward...to enable us to compete and
maintain our name as the number one reference publisher in the
English-speaking world," said Esposito, who was promoted from president of
Encyclopaedia Britannica North America to his current position on July 1,
1995.  He succeeded Peter Norton, who retired June 30.

Though terms of the sale to Safra's group were not disclosed, analysts
estimated the property could fetch as much as $500 million.  When plans for a
sale were hinted at in the spring, speculation about possible buyers ranged
from Simon & Schuster to Microsoft.

Encyclopaedia Britannica released a statement in April saying it was seeking
cash to develop new products and sales channels, and that a new owner was one
of three options (BPR, May 22, 1995).  The other two options were a joint
venture partner and an outside investor.

At the time, Encyclopaedia Britannica denied it was leaning toward a sale,
saying it was "considering all alternatives equally."  Encyclopaedia
Britannica was owned by William Benton Foundation, an Illinois not-for-profit
organization whose sole beneficiary is the University of Chicago.

A Happy Ending For The Financial Story?

Encyclopaedia Britannica sales, like those of competitor World Book, have been
lagging in recent years.  Between 1990 and 1993, the number of book-sets sold
fell more than 50% from 117,000 to 51,000.  The company posted a slight
revenue decline in 1994, when it generated sales of $454 million.

According to Esposito, the financial backing from the new owner may allow
Encyclopaedia Britannica to get back on track with new products.  "We'll
expand our program and the content we create," Esposito told BPR.
Encyclopaedia Britannica also plans to further its position on the World Wide
Web.

Sale Comes During Company Overhaul

In August, Encyclopaedia Britannica began to restructure its North American
direct sales forces that is intended to more effectively target lead
generation and sales efforts, as well as reduce administrative costs.

Under the new organization, Encyclopaedia Britannica reduced its number of
sales offices from 91 to 20, and offered sales reps the opportunity to switch
from independent contractor to employee status.  With the shift, the company
has focused its efforts on the 4,800 zip codes from which 70% of its sales are
already generated.

Encyclopaedia Britannica's remaining sales offices are in Maryland, New York,
Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Colorado, Texas, California, Florida, New
Jersey, Puerto Rico, North Carolina, Minnesota and Canada.

Morrow Brings Rob Weisbach On Board, Forms New Imprint 


William Morrow & Co.  last month lured former Bantam Books senior editor Rob
Weisbach on board as vice president and publisher of his own imprint.

Rob Weisbach Books will launch Jan.  8 and "will play a significant part in
the continued growth and innovation at William Morrow," according to William
Wright, president and CEO of the Hearst Book Group.  The new imprint will
focus on high profile commercial non-fiction as well as fiction, and will
produce 10 to 12 titles a year.  Weisbach will hire a senior editor and an
assistant editor to staff the imprint.

While at Bantam, Weisbach published several New York Times bestsellers,
including titles by popular TV personalities Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Reiser and
Ellen DeGeneres.  At Morrow, Weisbach said he intends to build "a list that
will be funny, inspiring and original...and will aim to satisfy a broad range
of readers."

Microsoft Press To Double Sales In Fiscal 1996, Says Welke


Microsoft Press (Redmond, WA), the computer book publishing arm of software
giant Microsoft Corp., expects to nearly double its revenues to more than $80
million in fiscal 1996, ended June 30, general manager Elton Welke told BPR.

The increase will come largely as a result of sales of Windows 95-specific
books, Welke said.  "We're having an astonishing year on top of a very good
year in fiscal 1995," he added.

Despite the fact that the release of the Windows 95 operating system slipped
out of fiscal 1995--where Microsoft Press budgeted for the windfall of Windows
95 revenues to hit--"we made our numbers without it."  and finished fiscal
1995 with $42 million in revenues, Welke said.  "Our fiscal 1996 numbers will
be extraordinary as a result" of the unbudgeted sales of Windows 95-specific
books, he told BPR.

Although Windows 95 has contributed significantly to Microsoft Press's recent
revenue growth, it's not the only topic that's hot.  Internet and professional
training books are doing very well too, Welke said.  In addition, Microsoft
Press will publish two interactive multimedia books on CD ROM this fiscal
year, and intends to release "considerably more" CD ROM titles in fiscal 1997,
according to Welke.

The publisher's most recent run-away bestseller is Windows 95 Resource Kit,
which has more than 1 million copies in print and 600,000 sold to date.

"Our international business is growing at a good clip, Windows 95 books are
selling well, we're continuing our basic line of applications and tutorial
books, we've increased our high-end technical books and we're entering into
interactive multimedia," Welke said.  "Right now, all cylinders are firing."

Banta To Buy Manufacturing Unit From Times Mirror Education Group


Banta Corp.  has agreed to acquire Times Mirror Higher Education Group's
manufacturing division.  Terms of the transaction, which is slated to close in
the first quarter of 1996, were not disclosed.

The acquisition will include the Dubuque, IA-based printing and bindery
operations that primarily serve the three educational publishing companies of
Times Mirror's Higher Education Group.  The Dubuque operation will become part
of the Banta Book Group, which has plants in Menasha, WI and Harrisonburg, VA,
and will remain fully intact with its 230 existing employees, a Times Mirror
Higher Education Group spokesperson told BPR.

The Times Mirror Higher Education Group includes Wm.  C.  Brown Publishers,
Brown & Benchmark Publishers and Richard D.  Irwin, and was the fourth-largest
higher education publisher in the U.S.  in 1994 with an estimated $230 million
in revenues (BPR, Aug.  21, 1995).  Banta will continue supplying the
education group with printing and graphic services after the sale goes
through.

G.  Franklin Lewis, chairman and CEO of the Times Mirror Higher Education
Group, said the company had "conducted a long and diligent search" for a buyer
that "could be a cultural match with the Times Mirror High Education Group;
would pursue the course of providing low-cost printing solutions to our
printing needs; and be a technology partner as we explore new and effective
ways of providing print product as well as increasing access to electronic
product...We believe we have that in Banta Corp."

Warner Bros.  Worldwide Licenses Characters To Seven Publishers


Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing (Burbank, CA) licensed its popular content
and cartoon characters to seven publishers who will produce roughly 90 books
based on the material.  The licenses are part of an ambitious effort on the
part of Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing that will result in the release of
more than 200 books based on its properties in 1996.

The seven publishers who licensed the material are Landoll Publishing, Walter
Foster Publishing, Publications International, Penguin USA, Warner Books,
Scholastic Inc.  and DC Comics.

Of the group, Landoll Publishing (Ashland, OH) will release the first titles
with a 42-book mass market line of color and activity books, paint with water
books, sticker, marker and paint pop-up books and story books.  All titles
will feature Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and other Warner Bros.  characters.  The
line will launch Jan.  15.  Landoll's deal calls for at least 24 additional
titles to be released next summer featuring the Animaniacs, Pinky & The Brain,
Slappy Squirrel and Goodfeathers characters.

Beginning in April, Publications International (Lincolnwood, IL) expects to
release a line of electronic chip "Play-a-Sound" books, each with four, five,
seven or 16 sound buttons.  DC Comics licensed Pinky and The Brain for a line
of 12 comic books to be released in May in the U.S.  and Canada.

Walter Foster Publishing will release two how-to-draw books in June as part of
its agreement.  Later in the summer, two graphic novels based on the
Animaniacs characters will be published by Scholastic Inc.

Though Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing operates separately from Time Inc.
and its imprints, sister company Warner Books (New York) was cut a piece of
the deal through an agreement to publish four adult pop-up books featuring the
Looney Tunes characters.

Finally, next holiday season, Penguin USA (New York) will release a line of
children's titles, including plush books, electronic chip books and paint
books based on Warner Bros.  characters.

Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing was launched in 1994 by Warner Bros.
Consumer Products, which handles licenses for Warner Bros.  content and
characters (BPR, March 28, 1994).

Time Warner AudioBooks Reorganizes, Moves To New York


Time Warner AudioBooks today moves from Los Angeles to New York and makes
Warner Books its sole distributor.

With the shift, former vice president of operations Judith McGuinn was named
vice president and director of Time Warner AudioBooks.  McGuinn will be
responsible for day-to-day operations and strategic planning, and reports to
Maureen Mahon Egen, senior vice president and publisher of Warner Books.

Egen said the relocation will provide better opportunities for cross-promotion
of audiobooks through the sales and marketing operations already in place for
books.

The company will have a west coast production office in Century City where
Maja Thomas, director of production, and John Whitman, executive editor, will
be based.  All other departments will be housed in the Time Life building in
New York.

House Votes To Allow Lawmakers Book Royalties, But No Advances


In a vote sparked by the year-old ruckus surrounding House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's controversial multi-million dollar book deal with HarperCollins,
the House approved a proposal allowing lawmakers to receive unlimited book
royalties--as long as they have their contracts cleared by the ethics
committee and do not accept advances from publishers.

The House voted 259 to 128 to adopt the rule proposed by Rep.  Gerald Solomon
(R-NY).  The vote flew in the face of a 10-0 ethics committee recommendation
on Dec.  6 to curb royalty income starting Jan.  1, 1996 by including the
monies in the $20,040 cap on outside earned income for lawmakers.

Failure to pass the proposal could have cost Gingrich millions in royalties he
will collect from sales of the HarperCollins title released in 1995, To Renew
America.

Gingrich drew fire when it first became public that he was in line to collect
a $4.5 million advance for a two-book deal he struck with HarperCollins, a
division of media conglomerate News Corp.  The deal was labeled unethical
because News Corp.'s Fox Television Network was embroiled in a battle with the
Federal Communications Commission over foreign ownership of TV stations.
Public outcry forced Gingrich to give up the advance, but not the royalties
the two books will generate.

According to House Democratic Whip David Bonior (D-MI), last week's action
marked the first time a recommendation from the ethics committee was weakened
in a House vote.

In a report on its findings on ethics charges against Gingrich, the ethics
committee last week stated, "The committee strongly questions the
appropriateness of what some could describe as an attempt by Rep.  Gingrich to
capitalize on his office...The committee believes that the existing House rule
must be changed to clearly restrict the income a member may derive from
writing books."

Steck-Vaughn Acquires Summit Learning In $4 Million Deal


Educational publisher Steck-Vaughn last month acquired Ft.  Collins, CO-based
Summit Learning from American Educational Products for approximately $4
million.

Steck-Vaughn was the fifth-largest U.S.  publisher of supplementary
educational materials in 1994 with revenues of $53.6 million, according to
BPR's sister publication, Educational Marketer.  AEP, which also owns
Scott/Hubbard and Churchill Films, was the tenth-largest U.S.  publisher of
supplementary educational materials in 1994, with estimated revenues of $21.1
million.

The acquisition will allow Steck-Vaughn to broaden its marketing channels to
reach school decision makers at all levels through Summit's established direct
response marketing presence among both classroom teachers and consumers.
Steck-Vaughn said it expected Summit's 1995 revenues to top $10 million.

Steck-Vaughn will use Summit as a launchpad for a new line of proprietary
products for the parent and teacher store market.  Until now, Summit has
focused primarily on mathematics curriculum, with a growing presence in
science.

Legal Publishers See Growth Via Electronic Products


Editor's note:  This is the first in a two-part series on the legal book
publishing market.

According to the Book Industry Study Group's Book Industry Trends 1995, the
legal publishing market accounted for $1.3 billion dollars in 1994, up 10.3%
over 1993.  Although law publishers have experienced the same acquisition
frenzy found in other areas of the publishing industry, new owners have tended
to keep their subsidiaries separate, using them to establish or maintain
niches in the marketplace.

A recent informal BPR survey of key legal publishers found that despite the
acquisitions, a fairly level playing field has been maintained.  In addition,
advances in electronic media have revolutionized the way legal information is
published.

"The industry is not necessarily getting consolidated, but there are more big
players," said Paul Wojcik, president & chief operating officer of The Bureau
of National Affairs Inc.  "We might be the largest independent legal
publishing company left."

The Bureau, which reported a 7.3% increase in 1994 operating revenues to
$215.5 million, is entirely employee owned.  Of BNA's 1,800 employees, 1,500
are based in Washington, DC with the rest scattered as correspondents in state
capitals.  Publishing more than 200 print and electronic products of national
scope per year (including four daily publications and a number of
newsletters), the company divides its books into three categories:
Environmental Safety & Health, Human Resources & Labor Management, and Law,
Business and International.  In 1994, the book division reported revenues of
$4.7 million, a company record.

BNA counts among its key titles Media Law by Rex S.  Heinke (1994), the
three-volume Copyright Law and Practice by William Patry (1994), and Mental
and Emotional Injuries in Employment Litigation by James J.  McDonald, Jr.
and Francine B.  Kulick (1994).

The company has discontinued the 28 looseleaf binder version of BNA's
Environment Library and now offers the product exclusively on CD ROM.
Products on CD ROM now account for more than half of BNA's subscription sales.

"The electronic information piece is booming," Wojcik noted.  "It's also the
most confusing part of the business."  A particular benefit of the CD ROM
format, according to Wojcik, is the ability to add large amounts of public
domain information to existing texts.

Thomson Legal Publishing, a division of The Thomson Corp.  (Toronto), made
several key acquisitions in the past year.  The most recent buy included the
topical product business and other non-citation legal information products
from Shepard's McGraw-Hill in November.  The company will integrate Shepard's
products into its existing U.S.  legal publishing operations, which has 3,000
employees and annual revenues of $400 million.

In other acquisitions, however, Thomson Legal Publishing has maintained the
separate identities of its companies, which include Bancroft-Whitney of San
Francisco, Lawyer's Cooperative Publishing of Rochester, NY and Clark Boardman
Callaghan of New York.

Bancroft-Whitney, for example, is devoted to publishing materials for the
California law market.  When Thomson acquired San Francisco-based Barclay's
Law Publishers in February 1995, its California unit was transferred to
Bancroft-Whitney, with the remainder of the company left to function as a
division of Lawyer's Cooperative Publishing.  In November, Bancroft-Whitney
acquired Legal Solutions Inc., a producer of legal forms for California
attorneys.  LSI maintains separate headquarters in Corona, CA.

With approximately 160 employees, Bancroft-Whitney published four print and
six electronic titles in 1995.  Among its major titles are the Witkin library
of four California legal treatises, (which is handled by a separate 15-person
department), Deering's California Codes (186 hardbound volumes, updated
annually) and Barclay's Official California Code of Regulations.  All are
available in CD ROM format as well as print.

Barclay's employs 30 people in south San Francisco.  According to publisher
Laurie Carron, the company's charter as part of Thomson is to "sell to the
non-legal market."  This is achieved by "slicing and dicing" state codes for
businesses into industry-specific products.  "Businesses that are regulated,
not just the lawyers, need these codes," she said.  Barclay's currently
publishes official codes in four states.  "We try to add new states all the
time," Carron said.

The second part of this series will feature Matthew Bender, John Wiley & Sons,
West Publishing, Wolters Kluwer and Reed Elsevier.

In The Loop. . .


Dove flies to larger coop...Beverly Hills, CA-based Dove Audio Inc.  last
month completed a $5.8 million equity offering that will allow it to move to
larger quarters in West Hollywood in February.  Dove used the offering
proceeds to buy the two-story, 22,000 square-foot building that formerly
housed the Writer's Guild of America.  The new facilities will include two
state-of-the-art, fully-digital recording studios, editorial suites, a storage
area with a computerized catalog system to archive all Dove masters, and will
be equipped to do audio and video post-production work.  The building will
also include retail space.  Dove president Michael Viner said the move was
necessary because staff size has doubled over the past year, and noted the
purchase of the building fits with future expansion plans for Dove Audio.

New book finds bumps in 'The Road Ahead'...  A little more than a month after
Penguin USA's release of The Road Ahead by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates,
naysayer Anthony "Andy" Martin has entered the fray with a book of his own:
Bill Gates:  The Robber Baron of Cyberspace.  In announcing the release of his
book, Martin, executive director of a Washington, DC-based organization called
"the Committee to Fight Microsoft Corp.," claims to answer the "dire
forecasts" put forth by Gates in his book.  Martin says his title is based on
"original research, 'inside' Microsoft sources and a searching review of
available public records and documents."  Bill Gates:  The Robber Baron of
Cyberspace is available through its Palm Beach, FL-based publisher, Orange
State Press, for $19.95.  Meanwhile, The Road Ahead ranked as as one of the
top-selling books of the 1995 holiday buying season.

Waterstone's to hit 'The Wall'?...Rumor on the street has it that U.K.-based
parent company W.H.  Smith this month will merge the management of its
respective U.S.  bookstore and music store chains, Waterstone's and The Wall.
A source within the company told BPR it was unclear whether the merger would
extend to the primarily mall-based stores themselves.

'Free Press' coming this month...In an effort to speed Free Press hardcover
titles to press in paperback format, Simon & Schuster will launch a new
paperback imprint this month--Free Press Paperbacks.  The imprint is expected
to release one to two dozen titles a year, the first of which will be The Bell
Curve by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein.  Simon & Schuster folded The
Free Press hardcover imprint into its trade books division in June 1995 (BPR,
June 28, 1995).  Free Press publishes about 100 titles a year on a variety of
topics, including business, social issues, politics, history and behavioral
science.

People In The News.  .  .


Crown Books parent Dart Group last week lost its knight in shining armor when
Robert Marmon resigned because he and Dart Group could not agree upon an
ongoing compensation package.  Marmon, who has served as Dart's chief
financial officer since October 1994 and was instrumental in putting in place
a plan to restore stability to the company following the raging battles of the
Haft family, will remain at Dart through February to help recruit his
successor.

Separately, Crown Books named John Sutton, Cynthia Holland and Ellen Marshall
as divisional merchandising managers.  Sutton will handle the buying of all
trade fiction, non-fiction and mass market books.  Holland will oversee the
buying of all other merchandise, and Marshall will be responsible for
merchandising operations.  Sutton and Marshall are veteran Crown employees,
while Holland moved to Crown from Waldenbooks in the summer of 1994.

HarperCollins named Matthew Goldberg vice president, director of product and
market development for its Adult Trade Publishing Group.  Goldberg was
formerly director of national accounts at HarperCollins.  In addition, the
publisher named Linda Stormes vice president, director of national accounts.
Stormes moved to HarperCollins from Random House, where she had been national
account manager.  HarperCollins also named Jeff Rogart to the newly combined
position of director of sales/advanced media and merchandise accounts.  In
addition to his current responsibilities for selling HarperCollins' advanced
media products to all channels, Rogart will assume direct selling
responsibilities to Price Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's, as well as the
distributors that serve that marketplace.

Recent appointments at Avon Books included naming Jennifer Hershey as
executive editor and Jennifer Brehl as senior editor.  Hershey joined Avon
from Bantam Books, while Brehl, who will oversee Avon's science fiction and
fantasy list, was previously at Bantam Doubleday Dell.  The appointments
follow those of Debby Tobias to vice president, director of sales, and Trish
Lande Grader to executive editor (BPR, Nov.  20, 1995)

Des Moines, IA-based Meredith Corp.  named Barb Preuss advertising and
merchandising manager for retail book marketing at its publishing group.
Preuss was previously direct mail copywriter at Kirke-Van Orsdel Inc., a West
Des Moines insurance company.
