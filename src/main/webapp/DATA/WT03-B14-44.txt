above&#173;average risk in return for above&#173;average capital
growth potential. <BR>

Shares, Adviser Shares and Select Shares. Whether an investor
is eligible to purchase Institutional, Adviser or Select Shares
generally depends on the amount invested in a particular Fund

or through a financial adviser. The classes differ primarily with
respect to (i)&nbsp;the level of Shareholder Service Fee and (ii)&nbsp;the
level of Distribution Fee borne by each class. <BR>

Absent such agreement by the Manager to waive its fee and bear such expenses, management fees would be 0.90% for the U.S. Small Cap Series&nbsp;and Total Fund Operating Expenses for the U.S. Small Cap Series&nbsp;would be 1.25% for Institutional Shares, 1.50% for Adviser Shares and 1.75% for Select Shares and management fees would be 1.00% for the Japan Series&nbsp;and Total Fund Operating Expenses for the Japan Series&nbsp;would be 7.26% for Institutional Shares, 7.51% for Adviser Shares and 7.76% for Select Shares. Absent such agreement by the Manager to waive its fee and bear such expenses, management fees would be 1.00% for the International Small Cap Series. Assuming average daily net assets of the International Small Cap Series&nbsp;for the first year of operations are $10,000,000, it is estimated that Total Fund Operating Expenses for the International Small Cap Series&nbsp;for such fiscal year will be 3.73% for Institutional Shares, 3.98% for Adviser Shares and 4.23% for Select Shares.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objective of the U.S. Small Capitalization
Series&nbsp;is to seek total return greater than that of the Russell
2000 Index through investment primarily in equity securities of
smaller companies which are traded principally in the markets
of the United States. Total return is a combination of capital
appreciation and current income (dividend or interest). In the
case of the Fund, total return will be measured by changes in
value of an investment over a given period, assuming that any
dividends or capital gains distributions are reinvested in the
Fund rather than paid to the investor in cash. The Fund does not
seek to <I>maximize</I> total return but, as indicated above,
seeks a total return greater than that of the common stocks referred
to above. Because the companies in which the Fund invests typically
do not distribute significant amounts of company earnings to shareholders,
the Fund's objective will place relatively greater emphasis on
capital appreciation than on current income. The Fund's investment
objective is non&#173;fundamental and thus may be changed by the
Trustees without shareholder approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is currently expected that, under normal circumstances,
most of the Fund's assets will be invested in common stocks of
companies with total market capitalization of less than $750 million
(&quot;small capitalization securities&quot;). This corresponds
with the defining range of market capitalization of companies
in the Russell 2000 Index. Investments in issuers of small capitalization
securities may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation
because of high potential earnings growth, but may also involve
greater risk. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund
Investments&nbsp;- Companies with Small Market Capitalizations&quot;
below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To meet redemptions or pending investments in common
stocks, the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets
not invested in small capitalization securities in full faith
and credit obligations of the United States government (e.g.,
U.S. Treasury Bills) and in short&#173;term notes, commercial
paper or other money market instruments of high quality (i.e.,
rated at least &quot;A&#173;2&quot; or &quot;AA&quot; by Standard&nbsp;&amp;
Poor's (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;) or Prime 2 or &quot;Aa&quot; by Moody's
Investors Service,&nbsp;Inc. (&quot;Moody's&quot;)) issued by
companies having an outstanding debt issue rated at least &quot;AA&quot;
by S&amp;P or at least &quot;Aa&quot; by Moody's, or determined
by the Manager to be of comparable quality to any of the foregoing.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also, the Fund may invest without limit in common
stocks of foreign issuers which are listed on a United States
securities exchange or traded in the United States in the OTC
market. Investments in common stocks of foreign issuers may involve
certain special risks due to foreign economic, political and legal
developments. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund

traded outside of the United States. <BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Fundamental Policies.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
The Fund will normally invest most of its assets in small capitalization
securities, and it is a fundamental policy of the Fund, which
may not be changed without shareholder approval, that at least
65% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in small capitalization
securities. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>International Small Capitalization Series<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objective of the International Small
Capitalization Series&nbsp;is to seek total return greater than
the Cazenove Rosenberg Global Smaller Companies Index excluding
the United States (&quot;CRIEXUS&quot;) through investment primarily
in equity securities (i)&nbsp;that are traded principally in securities
markets outside of the United States and (ii)&nbsp;that represent
interests in companies currently with market capitalizations of
between $15 million and $1 billion at the time of purchase by
the Fund. Such companies are referred to herein as &quot;small
capitalization companies.&quot; CRIEXUS is comprised of stocks
of small capitalization companies in mature markets. Total return
is a combination of capital appreciation and current income (dividend
or interest). In the case of the Fund, total return will be measured
by changes in value of an investment over a given period, assuming
that any dividends or capital gains distributions are reinvested
in the Fund rather than paid to the investor in cash. The Fund
does not seek to <I>maximize</I> total return but, as indicated
above, seeks a total return greater than that of the common stocks
referred to above. Because the companies in which the Fund invests
typically do not distribute significant amounts of company earnings
to shareholders, the Fund's objective will place relatively greater
emphasis on capital appreciation than on current income. The Fund's
investment objective is non&#173;fundamental and thus may be changed
by the Trustees without shareholder approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are no prescribed limits on geographic asset
distribution and the Fund has the authority to invest in securities
traded in securities markets of any country in the world. It is
currently expected that the Fund will invest in approximately
twenty different countries across three regions&nbsp;- Europe,
Pacific and North America (excluding the United States). Under
certain adverse investment conditions, the Fund may restrict the
number of securities markets in which its assets will be invested,
although under normal market circumstances, the Fund's investments
will involve securities principally traded in at least three different
countries. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;-

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under normal circumstances, at least 90% of the Fund's
total assets will be invested in common stocks of small capitalization
companies. It is the non&#173;fundamental policy of the Fund to
invest at least 65% of the Fund's total assets in common stocks
of small capitalization companies. Investments in such companies
may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation because
of high potential earnings growth, but may also involve greater

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Japan Series<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objective of the Japan Series&nbsp;is
to seek total return greater than that of the Tokyo Stock Price
Index (&quot;TOPIX&quot;) of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. TOPIX is
a capitalization weighted index of all stocks in the First Section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Total return is a combination of
capital appreciation and current income (dividend or interest).
The Fund will seek to meet this objective primarily through investment
in Japanese equity securities, primarily in common stocks of Japanese
companies. The Fund expects that any income it derives will be
from dividend or interest payments on securities. The Fund's investment
objective is non&#173;fundamental and thus may be changed by the
Trustees without shareholder approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is currently expected that, under normal circumstances,
the Fund will invest at least 90% of its assets in &quot;Japanese
Securities,&quot; that is, securities issued by entities (&quot;Japanese
Companies&quot;) that are organized under the laws of Japan and
that either have 50% or more of their assets in Japan or derive
50% or more of their revenues from Japan. While the Fund will
invest primarily in common stocks of Japanese Companies, it may
also invest in other Japanese Securities, such as convertible
preferred stock, warrants or rights, as well as short&#173;term
government debt securities or other short&#173; term prime obligations
(i.e., high quality debt obligations maturing not more than one
year from the date of issuance). See &quot;General Description
of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;- Foreign Exchange Transactions&quot;
below. The Fund will not customarily purchase warrants or rights,
although it may receive warrants or rights through distributions
on other securities it owns. In those cases, the Fund expects
to sell such warrants and rights within a reasonable period of
time following their distribution to the Fund. The Fund does not
currently expect to own warrants or rights with an aggregate value
of greater than 5% of the Fund's assets. Refer to the Statement
of Additional Information for further information with respect
to the Fund's investments in warrants or rights. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Fund currently intends to make its investments
in Japanese equity securities, principally in well&#173;established
Japanese Companies that have an active market for their shares.
Japanese Companies will be considered well&#173;established if
they have been subject for at least two years to the financial
accounting rules&nbsp;for a company whose securities are traded
on a Japanese securities exchange. In the discretion of the Fund's
management, the balance of the Fund's investments may be in companies
that do not meet all such qualifications, although the nature
of the market for the shares will always be an important consideration
in determining whether the Fund will invest in such shares. The
Fund anticipates that most Japanese equity securities in which
it will invest, either directly or indirectly (by means of convertible
debentures), will be listed on securities exchanges in Japan.

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Index Futures.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The Fund
may also purchase futures contracts or options on futures contracts
on the Tokyo Stock Price Index (&quot;TOPIX&quot;) or the NIKKEI
225 Index (&quot;NIKKEI&quot;) for investment purposes. TOPIX
futures are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade and NIKKEI futures
are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. See &quot;General

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Risks of Investing in Japanese Securities.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Unlike other mutual funds which invest in the securities of many
countries, the Fund will invest almost exclusively in Japanese
Securities. Generally, the Manager will not vary the percentage
of the Fund's assets which are invested in Japanese Securities
based on its assessment of Japanese economic, political or regulatory
developments or changes in currency exchange rates. However, the
Manager reserves the right to hedge against a possible decline
in the Japanese Securities market by utilizing futures and options
on futures on Japanese stock indices as described above with respect
to 100% of the Fund's total assets. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Because a high percentage of the Fund asset's will
be invested in Japanese Securities, investment in the Fund will
involve the general risks associated with investing in foreign
securities. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;-Special
Considerations of Foreign Investments&quot; below. In addition,
investors will be subject to the market risk associated with investing
almost exclusively in stocks of companies which are subject to
Japanese economic factors and conditions. Since the Japanese economy
is dependent to a significant extent on foreign trade, the relationships
between Japan and its trading partners and between the yen and
other currencies are expected to have a significant impact on
particular Japanese companies and on the Japanese economy generally.
The Fund is designed for investors who are willing to accept the
risks associated with changes in such conditions and relationships.

INVESTMENTS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Investment Risks.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> An investment
in the Funds involves risks similar to those of investing in common
stocks directly. Just as with common stocks, the value of Fund
shares may increase or decrease depending on market, economic,
political, regulatory and other conditions affecting a Fund's
portfolio. These types of risks may be greater with respect to
investments in securities of foreign issuers. Investment in shares
of the Funds is, like investment in common stocks, more volatile
and risky than some other forms of investment. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Companies with Small Market Capitalizations.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
As specified above, the U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;and
the International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;will invest
a relatively high percentage of their assets in companies with
relatively small market capitalizations (generally, market capitalizations
of under $750 million for the U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;and
under $1 billion for the International Small Capitalization Series).
Companies with small market capitalizations may be dependent upon
a single proprietary product or market niche, may have limited
product lines, markets or financial resources, or may depend on
a limited management group. Typically, such companies have fewer
securities outstanding, which may be less liquid than securities
of larger companies. Their common stock and other securities may
trade less frequently and in limited volume and are generally
more sensitive to purchase and sale transactions. Therefore, the
prices of such securities tend to be more volatile than the prices
of securities of companies with larger market capitalizations.
As a result, the absolute values of changes in the price of securities
of companies with small market capitalizations may be greater
than those of larger, more established companies. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Special Considerations of Foreign Investments.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Investing in foreign securities (i.e., those which are traded
principally in markets outside of the United States) involves
certain risks not typically found in investing in U.S. domestic
securities. These include risks of adverse change in foreign economic,
political, regulatory and other conditions, and changes in currency
exchange rates, exchange control regulations (including currency
blockage), expropriation of assets or nationalization, imposition
of withholding taxes on dividend or interest payments, and possible
difficulty in obtaining and enforcing judgments against foreign
entities. Furthermore, issuers of foreign securities are subject
to different, and often less comprehensive, accounting, reporting
and disclosure requirements than domestic issuers. In certain
countries, legal remedies available to investors may be more limited
than those available with respect to investments in the United
States or other countries. The laws of some foreign countries
may limit a Fund's ability to invest in securities of certain
issuers located in those countries. The securities of some foreign
issuers and securities traded principally in foreign securities
markets are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities
of comparable U.S. issuers and securities traded principally in
U.S. securities markets. Foreign brokerage commissions and other
fees are also generally higher than those charged in the United
States. There are also special tax considerations which apply
to securities of foreign issuers and securities traded principally
in foreign securities markets. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The risks of investing in foreign securities may
be intensified in the case of investments in emerging markets
or countries with limited or developing capital markets. Prices
of securities of companies in emerging markets can be significantly
more volatile than prices of securities of companies in the more
developed nations of the world, reflecting the greater uncertainties
of investing in less developed markets and economies. In particular,
countries with emerging markets may have relatively unstable governments,
present the risk of nationalization of businesses, restrictions
on foreign ownership, or prohibitions of repatriation of assets,
and may have less protection of property rights than more developed
countries. The economies of countries with emerging markets may
be predominantly based on only a few industries or dependent on
revenues from particular commodities or on international aid or
development assistance, may be highly vulnerable to changes in
local or global trade conditions, and may suffer from extreme
and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates. Local securities
markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable
to respond effectively to increases in trading volume, potentially
making prompt liquidation of substantial holdings difficult or
impossible at times. Consequently, securities of issuers located
in countries with emerging markets may have limited marketability
and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.
Also, such local markets typically offer less regulatory protections
for investors. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Foreign Exchange Transactions.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
The International Equity Portfolios of the Trust (i.e., the International
Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;and the Japan Series) do not
currently intend to hedge the foreign currency risk associated
with investments in securities denominated in foreign currencies.
However, in order to hedge against possible variations in foreign
exchange rates pending the settlement of securities transactions,
the International Equity Portfolios reserve the right to buy or
sell foreign currencies or to deal in forward foreign currency
contracts; that is, to agree to buy or sell a specified currency
at a specified price and future date. The International Equity
Portfolios also reserve the right to invest in currency futures
contracts and related options thereon for similar purposes. For
example, if the Manager anticipates that the value of the yen
will rise relative to the dollar, a Fund could purchase a currency
futures contract or a call option thereon or sell (write) a put
option to protect against an increase in the price of yen&#173;denominated
securities such Fund intends to purchase. If the Manager anticipates
a fall in the value of the yen relative to the dollar, a Fund
could sell a currency futures contract or a call option thereon
or purchase a put option on such futures contract as a hedge.
If the International Equity Portfolios change their present intention
and decide to utilize hedging strategies, futures contracts and
related options will be used only as a hedge against anticipated
currency rate changes (not for investment purposes) and all options
on currency futures written by a Fund will be covered. These practices,
if utilized, may present risks different from or in addition to
the risks associated with investments in foreign currencies. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Stock Index Futures.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> A
stock index futures contract (an &quot;Index Future&quot;) is
a contract to buy an integral number of units of the relevant
index at a specified future date at a price agreed upon when the
contract is made. A unit is the value at a given time of the relevant
index. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In connection with a Fund's investment in common
stocks, a Fund may invest in Index Futures while the Manager seeks
favorable terms from brokers to effect transactions in common
stocks selected for purchase. A Fund may also invest in Index
Futures when the Manager believes that there are not enough attractive
common stocks available to maintain the standards of diversity
and liquidity set for the Fund pending investment in such stocks
when they do become available. Through the use of Index Futures,
a Fund may maintain a portfolio with diversified risk without
incurring the substantial brokerage costs which may be associated
with investment in multiple issuers. This may permit a Fund to
avoid potential market and liquidity problems (e.g., driving up
or forcing down the price by quickly purchasing or selling shares
of a portfolio security) which may result from increases or decreases
in positions already held by a Fund. Certain provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code may limit this use of Index Futures. A Fund
may also invest in Index Futures in order to hedge its equity
positions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In contrast to purchases of a common stock, no price
is paid or received by a Fund upon the purchase of a futures contract.
Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required
to deposit with its custodian in a segregated account in the name
of the futures broker a specified amount of cash or securities.
This is known by participants in the market as &quot;initial margin.&quot;
The type of instruments that may be deposited as initial margin,
and the required amount of initial margin, are determined by the
futures exchange on which the Index Futures are traded. The nature
of initial margin in futures transactions is different from that
of margin in securities transactions in that futures contract
margin does not involve the borrowing of funds by the customer
to finance the transactions. Rather, the initial margin is in
the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the
contract which is returned to the Fund upon termination of the
futures contract, assuming all contractual obligations have been
satisfied. Subsequent payments, called &quot;variation margin,&quot;
to and from the broker, will be made on a daily basis as the price
of the particular Index fluctuates, making the position in the
futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as &quot;marking
to the market.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Fund may close out a futures contract purchase
by entering into a futures contract sale. This will operate to
terminate the Fund's position in the futures contract. Final determinations
of variation margin are then made, additional cash is required
to be paid by or released to the Fund, and the Fund realizes a
loss or a gain. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Fund's investment in Index Futures involves risk.
Positions in Index Futures may be closed out by a Fund only on
the futures exchanges on which the Index Futures are then traded.
There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist for
any particular contract at any particular time. The liquidity
of the market in futures contracts could be adversely affected
by &quot;daily price fluctuation limits&quot; established by the
relevant futures exchange which limit the amount of fluctuation
in the price of an Index Futures contract during a single trading
day. Once the daily limit has been reached in the contract, no
trades may be entered into at a price beyond the limit. In such
events, it may not be possible for a Fund to close its futures
contract purchase, and, in the event of adverse price movements,
a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments
of variation margin. When the Fund has purchased a futures contract,
its risk is, however, limited to the amount of the contract. The
futures market may also attract more speculators than does the
securities market, because deposit requirements in the futures
market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities
market. Increased participation by speculators in the futures
market may also cause price distortions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Fund will not purchase Index Futures if, as a result,
the Fund's initial margin deposits on transactions that do not
constitute &quot;bona fide hedging&quot; under relevant regulations
of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission would be greater
than 5% of the Fund's total assets. In addition to margin deposits,
when a Fund purchases an Index Future, it is required to maintain,
at all times while an Index Future is held by the Fund, cash,
U.S. Government securities or other high grade liquid debt obligations
in a segregated account with its Custodian, in an amount which,
together with the initial margin deposit on the futures contract,
is equal to the current value of the futures contract. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Illiquid Securities.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Each
Fund may purchase &quot;illiquid securities,&quot; defined as
securities which cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary
course of business within seven days at approximately the value
at which a Fund has valued such securities, so long as no more
than 15% of the Fund's net assets would be invested in such illiquid
securities after giving effect to the purchase. Investment in
illiquid securities involves the risk that, because of the lack
of consistent market demand for such securities, the Fund may
be forced to sell them at a discount from the last offer price.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Portfolio Turnover.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Portfolio
turnover is not a limiting factor with respect to investment decisions.
Although the rate of portfolio turnover is very difficult to predict,
it is not anticipated that, under normal circumstances, the annual
portfolio turnover rate for each of the Funds will exceed 100%.
In any particular year, market conditions may well result in greater
portfolio turnover rates than are presently anticipated. The rate
of a Fund's portfolio turnover may vary significantly from time
to time depending on the volatility of economic and market conditions.
High portfolio turnover involves correspondingly greater brokerage
commissions and other transaction costs, which will be borne directly
by a Fund, and could involve realization of capital gains that
would be taxable when distributed to shareholders of such Fund.
To the extent portfolio turnover results in the realization of
net short&#173;term capital gains, such gains ordinarily are taxed
to shareholders at ordinary income tax rates. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Loans of Portfolio Securities.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Each Fund may lend some or all of its portfolio securities to
broker&#173;dealers. Securities loans are made to broker&#173;dealers
pursuant to agreements requiring that loans be continuously secured
by collateral in cash or U.S. Government securities at least equal
at all times to the market value of the securities lent. The borrower
pays to the lending Fund an amount equal to any dividends or interest
received on the securities lent. When the collateral is cash,
the Fund may invest the cash collateral in interest&#173;bearing,
short&#173;term securities. When the collateral is U.S. Government
securities, the Fund usually receives a fee from the borrower.
Although voting rights or rights to consent with respect to the
loaned securities pass to the borrower, a Fund retains the right
to call the loans at any time on reasonable notice, and it will
do so in order that the securities may be voted by the Fund if
the holders of such securities are asked to vote upon or consent
to matters materially affecting the investment. A Fund may also
call such loans in order to sell the securities involved. The
risks in lending portfolio securities, as with other extensions
of credit, include possible delay in recovery of the securities
or possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower
fail financially. However, such loans will be made only to broker&#173;dealers
that are believed by the Manager to be of relatively high credit
standing. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Manager's Discussion of U.S. Small Capitalization
Series&nbsp;Performance<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the fiscal year ending March&nbsp;31, 1996, the
total return of the U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;was
35.69% after deduction of fees and expenses, more than 6 &#189;
percentage points above the total return of the Russell 2000 Index.
The Manager believes that the U.S. Small Capitalization Series'
total return was the result of an overall rise in the market combined
with the Manager's identification of undervalued U.S. small company
stocks. In the last fiscal year, the prices of the undervalued
U.S. small company stocks selected by the Manager generally rose
towards the Manager's estimates of their fair value. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;has built
a diversified portfolio that closely tracks the risk factor and
industry profile of the Russell 2000 Index while emphasizing companies
that are selling at prices below the Manager's estimates of their
fair value. The total return of the U.S. Small Capitalization
Series&nbsp;has exceeded the total return of the Russell 2000
Index since inception of the Fund as well as in the latest 3&#173;
and 5&#173; year fiscal periods of the Fund. <BR>

<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the last fiscal year, the total return of
the Japan Series after deduction of fees and expenses was less
than the total return of its Tokyo Stock Price Index (&quot;TOPIX&quot;)
benchmark; however, the Series has outperformed the TOPIX benchmark
over the latest 3&#173; and 5&#173;year periods. Since inception
in January 1989, the Japan Series has outperformed the TOPIX by
an average of 1.66% per year while matching the risk factor, industry,
and capitalization characteristics of the benchmark. The Japan
Series maintains a diversified portfolio of moderately undervalued
securities identified by the Manager's proprietary stock selection
models. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under normal circumstances, the Japan Series' investments
in securities will be in yen&#173;denominated securities, thus
its value in U.S. dollars depends on prevailing exchange rates.
During the last fiscal year, the Yen depreciated by more than
20%, offsetting the overall rise in the Japanese equity market.
Since the inception of the Japan Series, the yen has appreciated
almost 15%. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Manager's General Investment Philosophy and
Strategy<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Manager attempts to add value relative to the
designated benchmark through a quantitative stock selection process,
and seeks to diversify investment risk across the several hundred
holdings in each Fund. In seeking to outperform each Fund's designated
benchmark, the Manager also attempts to control risk in the Fund's
portfolio relative to the securities constituting that benchmark.
So that each Fund is substantially invested in equities at all
times, the Manager does not earn the extraordinary return, or
&quot;alpha,&quot; by timing the market. The Manager seeks to
avoid constructing portfolios that significantly differ from the
relevant benchmark with respect to characteristics such as market
capitalization, historic volatility, or &quot;beta,&quot; and
industry weightings. Each Fund seeks to have a similar exposure
to these factors as the designated benchmark. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Investment Philosophy.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
The Manager's investment strategy is based on the belief that
stock prices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expected
future earnings of companies, their &quot;fundamental value.&quot;
The Manager believes that market prices will converge towards
fundamental value over time, and that therefore, any investor
who can accurately determine fundamental value, and who applies
a disciplined investment process to select those stocks that are
currently undervalued (i.e., the price is less than fundamental
value), will outperform the market over time. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The premise of the Manager's investment philosophy
is that there is a link between the price of a stock and the underlying
financial and operational characteristics of the company. In other
words, the price reflects the market's assessment of how well
the company is positioned to generate future earnings and/or future
cash flow. The Manager identifies and purchases those stocks which
are undervalued (i.e., they are currently cheaper than similar
stocks with the same characteristics). The Manager believes that
the market will recognize the &quot;better value&quot; and that
the mispricing will be corrected as the stocks in the Funds' portfolios
are purchased by other investors. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Determination of the relative valuation of a stock
is based upon a comparison of similar companies. In any group
of similar companies, it is the Manager's view that there are
always some that are overvalued, some that are undervalued, and
some that are fairly&#173;valued relative to the average valuation
for the group. These moderate valuation errors are believed to
be present in every sector of the market and can be identified
through rigorous quantitative analysis of fundamental data. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In determining whether or not a stock is attractive,
the Manager considers the company's current estimated fundamental
value as determined by the Manager's proprietary Appraisal Model,
the company's future earnings, and investor sentiment toward the
stock. The Manager identifies and causes a Fund to purchase an
undervalued stock and to hold it in the relevant Fund's portfolio
until the market recognizes and corrects for the misvaluation.
The Funds' portfolios are composed of undervalued stocks from
every sector represented in the relevant Fund's benchmark, with
a typical portfolio consisting of several hundred stocks. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Decision Process.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The
Manager's decision process is a continuum. Its research function
develops Models which analyze the 12,000 securities in the global
universe, both fundamentally and technically, and determines the
risk characteristics of the relevant Fund's benchmark. The portfolio
management function optimizes each portfolio's composition, executes
trades, and monitors performance and trading costs. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The essence of the Manager's approach is rigorous
attention to important aspects of the investment process. Factors
crucial to successful stock selection include: (1)&nbsp;accurate
and timely data on a large universe of companies; (2)&nbsp;subtle
quantitative descriptors of value and predictors of changes in
value; and (3)&nbsp;insightful definitions of similar businesses.
The Manager takes great care assimilating, checking and structuring
the input data on which its Models rely. The Manager believes
that if the data is correct, the recommendations made by the system
will be sound. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Stock Selection.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Fundamental
valuation of stocks is key to the Manager's investment process,
and the heart of the valuation process lies in the Manager's proprietary
Appraisal Model. Analysis of companies in the United States and
Canada is conducted in a single unified Model. The Appraisal Model
discriminates where the two markets are substantially different,
while simultaneously comparing companies in the two markets according
to their degrees of similarity. European companies and Asian companies
(other than Japanese companies) are analyzed in a nearly global
Model, which includes the United States and Canada as a further
basis for comparative valuation, but which excludes Japan. Japanese
companies are analyzed in an independent national Model. The Model
incorporates the various accounting standards which apply in different
markets and makes adjustments to ensure meaningful comparisons.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An important feature of the Appraisal Model is the
classification of companies into one or more of 166 groups of
&quot;similar&quot; businesses. Currently, in the United States,
160 groups are applicable; in Japan, 122 groups are applicable;
and in Europe, 154 groups are applicable. Each company is broken
down into its individual business segments, and each segment is
compared with similar business operations of other companies doing
business in the same geographical market. In most cases, the comparison
is extended to include companies with similar business operations
in different markets. Subject to the availability of data in different
markets, the Manager appraises the company's assets, operating
earnings and sales within each business segment, accepting the
market's valuation of that category of business as fair. The Manager
then integrates the segment appraisals into balance sheet, income
statement, and sales valuation models for the total company, and
simultaneously adjusts the segment appraisals to include appraisals
for variables which are declared only for the total company, such
as taxes, capital structure, and pension funding. The result is
a single valuation for each of the 12,000 companies followed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The difference between the Manager's appraisal and
the market price is believed to represent an opportunity for profit.
For each stock, the Manager develops &quot;appraisal alphas&quot;
(i.e., the expected rate of extraordinary return) by adjusting
for the rate at which the market has corrected for such misvaluations
in the past. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second sphere of analysis is captured by the Manager's
proprietary Earnings Change Model, which analyzes more than 20
variables to predict individual company earnings over a one year
horizon. The variables are fundamental and fall into three categories:
measures of past profitability, measures of company operations
and consensus earnings forecasts. The Earnings Change Model is
independent of the Appraisal Model and projects the change in
a company's earnings in cents/current price. The value of the
projected earnings change is converted to an &quot;earnings change
alpha&quot; by multiplying the projected change by the market's
historical response to changes of that magnitude. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally, the Manager's proprietary Investor Sentiment
Model quantifies investor sentiment about features of stocks which
influence price but which are not captured by the Appraisal Model
or the Earnings Change Model. This Model measures company quality
by looking at past price patterns and by predicting the probability
of deficient earnings. The Investor Sentiment Model also captures
market enthusiasm towards individual stocks by looking at broker
recommendations and analyst estimates. Investor sentiment alphas
are developed by multiplying the Model's sentiment scores by the
market's historical response to such scores. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each company's earnings change alpha and investor
sentiment alpha is added to its appraisal alpha to arrive at a
total company alpha. Stocks with large positive total company
alphas are candidates for purchase. Stocks held in a portfolio
with total company alphas that are only slightly positive, zero
or negative are candidates for sale. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Before trading, the Manager systematically analyzes
the short&#173;term price behavior of individual stocks to determine
the timing of trades. The Investor Sentiment Model quantifies
investor enthusiasm for each stock by analyzing its short&#173;term
performance relative to similar stocks, changes in analyst and
broker opinions about the stock, and earnings surprises. The Manager
develops a &quot;trading alpha&quot; for each stock (i.e., the
expected short&#173;term extraordinary return) which is designed
to enable the Funds to purchase stocks from supply and to sell
stocks into demand, greatly reducing trading costs. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Optimization.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The Manager's
portfolio optimization system seeks to optimize the trade&#173;off
between risk and reward relative to each Fund's benchmark. It
exploits the information developed by the Manager's stock selection
Models to maximize return relative to the benchmark, while avoiding
a portfolio with exposure to any other extraneous factors that
would distinguish the Fund's portfolio from the stocks constituting
the relevant benchmark. Within the geographic zone appropriate
for each Fund, the optimizer recommends positions in companies
which in aggregate constitute the most efficient portfolio. The
optimizer simultaneously considers total company alphas, trading
alphas, and risk and quantifies the expected &quot;net benefit&quot;
to the portfolio of each recommended transaction. A stock is considered
for sale when a higher alpha stock with complementary risk characteristics
has been identified. No transaction will be executed unless the
opportunity offered by the purchase candidate sufficiently exceeds
the potential of an existing holding to justify the transaction
costs. In most markets, portfolios are reoptimized continuously
throughout the day, allowing the Manager to respond immediately
to investment opportunities, subject to certain limitations on
short&#173;term trading applicable by virtue of each Fund's intention
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal
Revenue Code. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Trading.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The Manager's
trading system aggregates the recommended transactions for each
of the Funds and determines the feasibility of each recommendation
in light of the stock's liquidity, the expected transaction costs,
and general market conditions. It relays target price information
to a trader for each stock considered for purchase or sale. Trades
are executed through any one of four trading strategies: traditional
brokerage, networks, accommodation, and package or &quot;basket&quot;
trades. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The network arrangements the Manager has developed
with Instinet Matching System (IMS), Portfolio System for Institutional
Trading (POSIT), and the Arizona Stock Exchange (AZX) facilitate
large volume trading with little or no price disturbance and low
commission rates. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Accommodative trading (which we also refer to as
the Manager's &quot;match system&quot;) allows institutional buyers
and sellers of stock to electronically present the Manager with
their &quot;interest&quot; lists each morning. Any matches between
the inventory which the brokers have presented and the Manager's
own recommended trades are signaled to the Manager's traders.
Since the broker is doing agency business and has a client on
the other side of the trade, the Manager expects that the other
side will be accommodative in the price. The Manager's objective
in using this match system is to execute most trades on the Manager's
side of the bid/ask spread so as to minimize market impact. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Package trades further allow the Manager to trade
large lists of orders simultaneously using state of the art tools
such as the Instinet Real&#173;Time System, Instinet Order Matching
System and Lattice Trading System. Those tools provide order entry,
negotiation and execution capabilities, either directly to other
institutions or electronically to the floor of the exchange. The
advantages of using such systems include speed of execution, low
commissions, anonymity and very low market impact. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Manager continuously monitors trading costs to
determine the impact of commissions and price disturbance on the
Funds' portfolios. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Furman Selz LLC (&quot;Furman Selz&quot; or the &quot;Administrator&quot;),
a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place
of business at 230 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10169, serves
as the Trust's administrator and generally assists the Trust in
all aspects of its administration and operation. As compensation
for its administrative services, Furman Selz receives a monthly
fee based upon an annual percentage rate of 0.15% of the aggregate
average daily net assets of the Funds plus an annual fee of $30,000
for each Fund. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Furman Selz has also entered into an agreement with
the Trust for the provision of transfer agency services (and is
referred to herein as the &quot;Transfer Agent&quot; in such capacity)
and dividend disbursing services for the Funds. The principal
business address of the Transfer Agent is 230 Park Avenue, New
York, New York 10169. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On June&nbsp;28, 1996, Furman Selz and BISYS Group,&nbsp;Inc.
(&quot;BISYS&quot;) announced a definitive agreement which provides
for Furman Selz to transfer its mutual fund clients to BISYS.
This transaction is expected to close on or before September 30,
1996. BISYS, headquartered in Little Falls, New Jersey, supports
more than 5,000 financial institutions and corporate clients through
two strategic business units. BISYS Information Services Group
designs, administers and distributes over 30 families of proprietary
mutual funds consisting of more than 365 portfolios, and provides
401(k) marketing support, administration, and recordkeeping services
in partnership with 18 of the nation's leading bank and investment
management companies. It is expected that BISYS and its affiliates
will serve in Furman Selz' current capacity as Administrator and
Transfer Agent for the Funds on and after the closing of the transaction.

<FONT SIZE=2>State Street Bank and Trust Company (the &quot;Custodian&quot;)
serves as custodian of the assets of the Funds. The principal
address of the Custodian is Mutual Funds Division, Boston, Massachusetts
02102. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>A further discussion of the terms of the Trust's
administrative, custody and transfer agency arrangements is contained

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Distributor<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Adviser and Select Shares of each Fund are sold on
a continuous basis by the Company's distributor, Barr Rosenberg
Funds Distributor,&nbsp;Inc. (the &quot;Distributor&quot;), a
wholly&#173;owned subsidiary of Furman Selz. It is expected that
the Distributor will become a wholly&#173;owned subsidiary of
BISYS upon the closing of the above&#173;referenced transaction.
The Distributor's principal offices are located at 230 Park Avenue,
New York, New York 10169. Institutional Shares are purchased directly
from the Funds. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Solely for the purpose of compensating the Distributor
for services and expenses primarily intended to result in the
sale of Select Shares of the Funds, such shares are subject to
an annual Distribution Fee of up to 0.50% of the average daily
net assets attributable to such shares in accordance with a Distribution
Plan (the &quot;Distribution Plan&quot;) adopted by the Trust
pursuant to Rule 12b&#173;1 under the 1940 Act. Currently, each
Fund pays the Distributor an annual Distribution Fee of 0.25%
of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Select
Shares. Activities for which the Distributor may be reimbursed
include (but are not limited to) the development and implementation
of direct mail promotions and advertising for the Funds, the preparation,
printing and distribution of prospectuses for the Funds to recipients
other than existing shareholders, and contracting with one or
more wholesalers of the Funds' shares. The Distribution Plan for
Select Shares went into effect on August&nbsp;5, 1996. The Distribution
Plan is of the type known as a &quot;compensation&quot; plan.
This means that, although the trustees of the Trust are expected
to take into account the expenses of the Distributor in their
periodic review of the Distribution Plan, the fees are payable
to compensate the Distributor for services rendered even if the
amount paid exceeds the Distributor's expenses. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Distributor may also provide (or arrange for
another intermediary or agent to provide) personal and/or account
maintenance services to Adviser and Select shareholders of the
Funds (the Distributor or such entity is referred to as a &quot;Servicing
Agent&quot; in such capacity). A Servicing Agent will be paid
some or all of the Shareholder Servicing Fees charged with respect
to Adviser and Select Shares of the Funds pursuant to Servicing
Plans for such shares. </FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As indicated previously, the Funds offer three classes
of shares to investors, with eligibility generally depending on
the amount invested in the particular Fund and whether the investor
makes the investment directly or through a financial adviser.
The three classes of shares are Institutional Shares, Adviser
Shares and Select Shares. Each class of shares is generally subject
to a Fund Reimbursement Fee at the time of purchase and at the
time of redemption, although certain exceptions apply. The following

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>PURCHASE OF SHARES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The offering price for shares of each Fund is the
net asset value per share next determined after receipt of a purchase
order plus the applicable Fund Reimbursement Fee. See &quot;Net
Asset Value.&quot; The payment of a Fund Reimbursement Fee by
each cash investor, which is used to defray the significant costs
associated with investing the proceeds of the sale of the shares
to such investors, is designed to eliminate the diluting effect
such costs would otherwise have on the net asset value of shares
held by pre&#173;existing shareholders. The amount of the Fund
Reimbursement Fee represents the Manager's estimate of the costs
reasonably anticipated to be associated with the purchase of portfolio
securities by the Funds and is paid to and retained by the Funds
and used by the Funds to defray such costs. No portion of the
Fund Reimbursement Fee is paid to or retained by the Distributor
or the Manager. The Fund Reimbursement Fee for each Fund, expressed
as a percentage of the net asset value of the shares of each Fund,
is as follows: U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;- 0.25%;
International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;- 0.50%; Japan
Series&nbsp;- 0.50%. Reinvestments of dividends and capital gains
distributions paid by the Funds, in&#173;kind investments, investments
made through the Barr Rosenberg Automatic Investment Program and
additional investments of 401(k) participants are not subject
to a Fund Reimbursement Fee. Also, investors may be charged an
additional fee if they effect transactions through their particular
broker or agent. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As described below, the net asset value of the Japan
Series shares is determined as of 3:00 p.m., Tokyo time. See &quot;Net
Asset Value.&quot; Due to the 14 hour difference between Tokyo
time and New York time, investors who call in purchase orders
after 1:00&nbsp;a.m. New York time (with adjustment for daylight
savings time) will get the price of Japan Series&nbsp;shares as
determined on the next business day in Tokyo. In such circumstances,
investors should expect to receive the price published on the
<I>following</I> day (i.e., not the price published on the morning
of the day the order was placed). </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Institutional Shares may be purchased in exchange

or by a combination of such common stocks and cash. Purchase of
Institutional Shares of a Fund in exchange for stocks is subject
in each case to the determination by the Manager that the stocks
to be exchanged are acceptable. Securities accepted by the Manager
in exchange for Fund shares will be valued as set forth under
&quot;Determination of Net Asset Value&quot; (generally the last
quoted sale price) as of the time of the next determination of
net asset value after such acceptance. All dividends, subscription
or other rights which are reflected in the market price of accepted
securities at the time of valuation become the property of the
Fund and must be delivered to the Fund upon receipt by the investor
from the issuer. A gain or loss for federal income tax purposes
would be realized by investors subject to federal income taxation
upon the exchange, depending upon the investor's basis in the
securities tendered. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Manager will not approve the acceptance of securities
in exchange for Fund shares unless (1)&nbsp;the Manager, in its
sole discretion, believes the securities are appropriate investments
for the Fund; (2)&nbsp;the investor represents and agrees that
all securities offered to the Fund are not subject to any restrictions
upon their sale by the Fund under the Securities Act of 1933,
or otherwise; and (3)&nbsp;the securities may be acquired under
the Fund's investment restrictions. In addition, portfolio securities
acquired in exchange for Fund shares will (1)&nbsp;be acquired
for investment and not for resale; (2)&nbsp;be liquid securities;
and (3)&nbsp;have a readily ascertainable value. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Other Purchase Information<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An eligible shareholder may also participate in the
Barr Rosenberg Automatic Investment Program, an investment plan
that automatically debits money from the shareholder's bank account
and invests it in Select Shares of one or more of the Funds through
the use of electronic funds transfers. Investors may commence
their participation in this program with a minimum initial investment
of $10,000 and may elect to make subsequent investments by transfers
of a minimum of $50 into their established Fund account. You may
contact the Trust for more information about the Barr Rosenberg
Automatic Investment Program. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For purposes of calculating the purchase price of
Fund shares, a purchase order is received by the Trust on the
day that it is in &quot;good order&quot; unless it is rejected
by the Distributor. For a purchase order to be in &quot;good order&quot;
on a particular day a check or money wire must be received on
or before 4:15&nbsp;p.m. New York time (in the case of Adviser
Shares or Select Shares) of that day or, in the case of Institutional
Shares, the investor's securities must be placed on deposit at
DTC prior to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. New York time or, in the case of
cash investments, the Trust must have received adequate assurances
that federal funds will be wired to the Fund prior to 4:15&nbsp;p.m.
New York time, on the following business day. If the consideration
is received by the Trust after the deadline, the purchase price
of Fund shares will be based upon the next determination of net
asset value of Fund shares. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
to suspend the offering of shares of its Funds or to reject purchase
orders when, in the judgment of the Manager, such suspension or
rejection would be in the best interests of the Trust. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Shares of all Funds may be used as a funding medium
for IRAs and other qualified retirement plans (&quot;Plans&quot;).
The minimum initial investment for an IRA or a Plan is $10,000.
An IRA may be established through a custodial account with Investors
Fiduciary Trust Company. A special application must be completed
in order to create such an account. A $5.00 establishment fee
and an annual $12.00 maintenance and custody fee is payable with
respect to each IRA. In addition, a $10.00 termination fee will
be charged when the account is closed. Shares may also be purchased
for IRAs and Plans established with other authorized custodians.
Contributions to IRAs are subject to prevailing amount limits
set by the Internal Revenue Service. For more information about

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>REDEMPTION OF SHARES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Shares of each Fund may be redeemed by mail, or,
if authorized, by telephone. A Fund Reimbursement Fee is charged
at the time of redemption on all redemptions except in&#173;kind
redemptions of Institutional Shares and redemptions made under
the Systematic Withdrawal Plan. The Fund Reimbursement Fee paid
on such redemptions is used to defray the significant costs to
existing shareholders associated with the sale of Fund portfolio
securities to satisfy the redemption requests and to eliminate
the diluting effect such costs would otherwise have on the net
asset value of shares held by existing shareholders. The amount
of the Fund Reimbursement Fee represents the Manager's estimate
of the costs reasonably anticipated to be associated with redemptions
and is retained by the Funds to defray such costs. No portion
of the Fund Reimbursement Fee is paid to or retained by the Distributor
or the Manager. The Fund Reimbursement Fee for each Fund, expressed
as a percentage of the net asset value of the shares redeemed
of such Fund, is as follows: U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;-
0.25%; International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;- 0.50%;
Japan Series&nbsp;- 0.50%. The value of shares redeemed may be
more or less than the purchase price, depending on the market
value of the investment securities held by the particular Fund.

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust will redeem its shares at the net asset
value next determined after the request is received in &quot;good

Reimbursement Fee. The net asset values per share of the Funds
are determined as of 4:15&nbsp;p.m., New York time, on each day

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Requests in &quot;good order&quot; must include the
following documentation: <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(a) a letter of instruction, if required, or a stock

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Signature Guarantees<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To protect shareholder accounts, the Trust and its
transfer agent from fraud, signature guarantees are required to
enable the Trust to verify the identity of the person who has
authorized a redemption from an account. Signature guarantees
are required for (1)&nbsp;redemptions where the proceeds are to
be sent to someone other than the registered shareholder(s) at
the registered address, (2)&nbsp;redemptions of $25,000 or more,
and (3)&nbsp;share transfer requests. Signature guarantees may
be obtained from certain eligible financial institutions, including
but not limited to, the following: banks, trust companies, credit
unions, securities brokers and dealers, savings and loan associations
and participants in the Securities and Transfer Association Medallion
Program (&quot;STAMP&quot;), the Stock Exchange Medallion Program
(&quot;SEMP&quot;) or the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature
Program (&quot;MSP&quot;). Shareholders may contact the Trust
at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332 for further details. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Telephone<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Provided the Telephone Redemption Option has been
authorized by an investor in an account application, a redemption
of shares may be requested by calling the Transfer Agent at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332
and requesting that the redemption proceeds be mailed to the primary
registration address or wired per the authorized instructions.
If the Telephone Redemption Option or the Telephone Exchange Option
(as described below) is authorized, the Transfer Agent may act
on telephone instruction from any person representing himself
or herself to be a shareholder and believed by the Transfer Agent
to be genuine. The Transfer Agent's records of such instructions
are binding and the shareholder, and not the Trust or the Transfer
Agent, bears the risk of loss in the event of unauthorized instructions
reasonably believed by the Transfer Agent to be genuine. The Transfer
Agent will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions
communicated are genuine and, if it does not, it may be liable
for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.
The procedures employed in connection with transactions initiated
by telephone include tape recording of telephone instructions
and requiring some form of personal identification prior to acting
upon instructions received by telephone. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Systematic Withdrawal Plan<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An owner of $12,000 or more of shares of a Fund may
elect to have periodic redemptions made from the investor's account
to be paid on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual basis.
The maximum payment per year is 12% of the account value at the
time of the election. The shareholder will normally redeem a sufficient
number of shares to make the scheduled redemption payments on
a date selected by the shareholder. Depending on the size of the
payment requested and fluctuation in the net asset value, if any,
of the shares redeemed, redemptions for the purpose of making
such payments may reduce or even exhaust the account. A shareholder
may request that these payments be sent to a predesignated bank
or other designated party. Capital gains and dividend distributions
paid to the account will automatically be reinvested at net asset
value on the distribution payment date. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Further Redemption Information<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Redemption proceeds for shares of the Trust recently
purchased by check may not be distributed until payment for the
purchase has been collected, which may take up to fifteen business
days from the purchase date. Shareholders can avoid this delay
by utilizing the wire purchase option. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If the Manager determines, in its sole discretion,
that it would not be in the best interests of the remaining shareholders
of a Fund to make redemption payment wholly or partly in cash,
the Fund may pay the redemption price of Institutional Shares
in whole or in part by a distribution in kind of readily marketable
securities held by the relevant Fund in lieu of cash. There will
be no Fund Reimbursement Fee on redemptions in kind of Institutional
Shares. Securities used to redeem Fund shares in kind will be
valued in accordance with the Fund's procedures for valuation
described under &quot;Determination of Net Asset Value.&quot;
Securities distributed by the Fund in kind will be selected by
the Manager in light of the Fund's objective and will not generally
represent a <I>pro rata</I> distribution of each security held
in the Fund's portfolio. Investors may incur brokerage charges
on the sale of any such securities so received in payment of redemptions.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust may suspend the right of redemption and
may postpone payment for more than seven days when the New York
Stock Exchange is closed for other than weekends or holidays,
or if permitted by the rules&nbsp;of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, during periods when trading on the Exchange is restricted
or during an emergency which makes it impracticable for the Funds
to dispose of their securities or to fairly determine the value
of their net assets, or during any other period permitted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the protection of investors.

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>EXCHANGE OF FUND SHARES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Funds offer two convenient ways to exchange shares
in one Fund for shares of another Fund in the Trust. Shares of
a particular class of a Fund may be exchanged only for shares
of the same class in another Fund. There is no sales charge on
exchanges, but both the Fund from which the exchange is made and
the Fund into which the exchange is made will charge any applicable
Fund Reimbursement Fee. Before engaging in an exchange transaction,
a shareholder should read carefully the information in the Prospectus
describing the Fund into which the exchange will occur. A shareholder
may not exchange shares of a class of one Fund for shares of the
same class of another Fund that is not qualified for sale in the
state of the shareholder's residence. Although the Trust has no
current intention of terminating or modifying the exchange privilege,
it reserves the right to do so at any time. Except as otherwise
permitted by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Trust will give 60 days' advance notice to shareholders of
any termination or material modification of the exchange privilege.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An exchange is taxable as a sale of a security on
which a gain or loss may be recognized. Shareholders should receive
written confirmation of the exchange within a few days of the
completion of the transaction. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A new account opened by exchange must be established
with the same name(s), address and social security number as the
existing account. All exchanges will be made based on the respective
net asset values next determined following receipt of the request
by the Funds containing the information indicated below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Exchange by Mail<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To exchange Fund shares by mail, shareholders should
simply send a letter of instruction to the Trust. The letter of
instruction must include: (a)&nbsp;the investor's account number;
(b)&nbsp;the class of shares to be exchanged; (c)&nbsp;the Fund
from and the Fund into which the exchange is to be made; (d)&nbsp;the
dollar or share amount to be exchanged; and (e)&nbsp;the signatures
of all registered owners or authorized parties. All signatures
must be guaranteed by an eligible guarantor institution including
members of national securities exchanges, commercial banks or
trust companies, broker&#173;dealers, credit unions and savings
associations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Exchange by Telephone<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To exchange Fund shares by telephone or to ask questions
about the exchange privilege, shareholders may call the Trust
at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332. If you wish to exchange shares,
please be prepared to give the telephone representative the following
information: (a) the account number, social security number and
account registration; (b)&nbsp;the class of shares to be exchanged;
(c)&nbsp;the name of the Fund from which and the Fund into which
the exchange is to be made; and (d)&nbsp;the dollar or share amount
to be exchanged. Telephone exchanges are available only if the
shareholder so indicates by checking the &quot;yes&quot; box on
the Account Application. The Trust employs procedures, including
recording telephone calls, testing a caller's identity, and sending
written confirmation of telephone transactions, designed to give
reasonable assurance that instructions communicated by telephone
are genuine, and to discourage fraud. To the extent that a Fund
does not follow such procedures, it may be liable for losses due
to unauthorized or fraudulent telephone instructions. A Fund will
not be liable for acting upon instructions communicated by telephone
that it reasonably believes to be genuine. The Trust reserves
the right to suspend or terminate the privilege of exchanging
by mail or by telephone at any time. <BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With the exception of the Japan Series, the net asset
value of each class of shares of each Fund will be determined
once on each day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open
as of 4:15&nbsp;p.m., New York time. In the case of the Japan
Series, the net asset value of each class of shares of that Fund
will be determined once on each day on which the Tokyo Stock Exchange
is open as of 3:00&nbsp;p.m., Tokyo time. Due to the 14 hour time
difference, 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Tokyo time corresponds to 1:00&nbsp;a.m.
New York time (with adjustments for daylight savings time). Accordingly,
purchase orders received for the Japan Series&nbsp;after 1:00
a.m., New York time (with adjustments for daylight savings time)
will receive the offering price determined on the next business
day in Japan. See &quot;Purchase of Shares&quot; above. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The net asset value per share of each class of a
Fund is determined by dividing the particular class's proportionate
interest in the total market value of the Fund's portfolio investments
and other assets, less any applicable liabilities, by the total
outstanding shares of that class of the Fund. Specifically, each
Fund's liabilities are allocated among its classes. The total
of such liabilities allocated to a particular class plus that
class's shareholder servicing and/or distribution expenses, if
any, and any other expenses specially allocated to that class
are then deducted from the class's proportionate interest in the
Fund's assets. The resulting amount for each class is divided
by the number of shares of that class outstanding to produce the
&quot;net asset value&quot; per share. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Portfolio securities listed on a securities exchange
for which market quotations are available are valued at the last
quoted sale price on each business day, or, if there is no such
reported sale, at the most recent quoted bid price. Price information
on listed securities is generally taken from the closing price
on the exchange where the security is primarily traded. Unlisted
securities for which market quotations are readily available are
valued at the most recent quoted bid price, except that debt obligations
with sixty days or less remaining until maturity may be valued
at their amortized cost. Exchange&#173;traded options, futures
and options on futures are valued at the settlement price as determined
by the appropriate clearing corporation. Other assets and securities
for which no quotations are readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by the trustees of the Trust
or by persons acting at their direction. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>DISTRIBUTIONS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each Fund intends to pay out as dividends substantially
all of its net investment income (which comes from dividends and
any interest it receives from its investments and net realized
short&#173;term capital gains). Each Fund also intends to distribute
substantially all of its net realized long&#173;term capital gains,
if any, after giving effect to any available capital loss carryover.
Each Fund's policy is to declare and pay distributions of its
dividends and interest annually although it may do so more frequently
as determined by the Trustees of the Trust. The Funds' policy
is to distribute net realized short&#173;term capital gains and
net realized long&#173;term gains annually, although it may do
so more frequently as determined by the Trustees of the Trust
to the extent permitted by applicable regulations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All dividends and/or distributions will be paid out
in the form of additional shares of the Fund to which the dividends
and/or distributions relate at net asset value unless the shareholder
elects to receive cash. Shareholders may make this election by
marking the appropriate box on the Account Application or by writing
to the Administrator. There is no Fund Reimbursement Fee charged
on reinvested dividends or distributions. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>TAXES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated
investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. So long as a Fund distributes substantially
all of its dividend, interest and certain other income, its net
realized short&#173;term capital gains and its net realized long&#173;term
capital gains to its shareholders and otherwise qualifies for
the special rules&nbsp;governing the taxation of regulated investment
companies, the Fund itself will not pay federal income tax on
the amount distributed. Dividend distributions (<I>i.e.</I>, distributions
derived from interest, dividends and certain other income, including,
in general, short&#173;term capital gains) will be taxable to
shareholders subject to income tax as ordinary income. Distributions
of any long&#173;term capital gains are taxable as such to shareholders
subject to income tax, regardless of how long a shareholder may
have owned shares in such Fund. A distribution paid to shareholders
by a Fund in January&nbsp;of a year is generally deemed to have
been received by shareholders on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding
year, if the distribution was declared and payable to shareholders
of record on a date in October, November&nbsp;or December&nbsp;of
that preceding year. Each Fund will provide federal tax information
annually, including information about dividends and distributions
paid during the preceding year. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If more than 50% of a Fund's assets at fiscal year&#173;end
is represented by debt and equity securities of foreign corporations,
the Fund may (and the Japan Series and the International Small
Capitalization Series intend to) elect to permit shareholders
who are U.S. citizens or U.S. corporations to claim a foreign
tax credit or deduction (but not both) on their U.S. income tax
returns for their <I>pro rata</I> portion of qualified taxes paid
by the Fund to foreign countries. As a result, the amounts of
foreign income taxes paid by such Fund would be treated as additional
income to shareholders of such Fund for purposes of the foreign
tax credit. Each such shareholder would include in gross income
from foreign sources its <I>pro rata</I> share of such taxes.
Certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code may prevent
shareholders from receiving a full foreign tax credit or deduction
for their allocable amount of such taxes. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The foregoing is a general summary of the federal
income tax consequences of investing in a Fund to shareholders
who are U.S. citizens or U.S. corporations. Shareholders should
consult their own tax advisers about the tax consequences of an
investment in the Funds in light of each shareholder's particular
tax situation. Shareholders should also consult their own tax
advisers about consequences under foreign, state, local or other
applicable tax laws. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST AND OWNERSHIP
OF SHARES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust is a diversified open&#173;end series investment
company organized as a Massachusetts business trust under the
laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and
Declaration of Trust (the &quot;Declaration of Trust&quot;) dated
April&nbsp;1, 1988, as amended from time to time. The U.S. Small
Capitalization Series&nbsp;commenced operations on or about September&nbsp;13,
1988. The Japan Series&nbsp;commenced operations on or about January&nbsp;3,
1989. The International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;expects
to commence operations on or about the date of this Prospectus.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to
issue an unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial
interest which are presently divided into three series. Interests
in each of the Funds described in this Prospectus are represented
by shares of such Fund. The Declaration of Trust also permits
the Trustees, without shareholder approval, to subdivide any series
of shares into various sub&#173;series of shares with such dividend
preferences and other rights as the Trustees may designate. While
the Trustees have no current intention to exercise this power,
it is intended to allow them to provide for an equitable allocation
of the impact of any future regulatory requirements which might
affect various classes of shareholders differently. The Trustees
may also, without shareholder approval, establish one or more
additional separate portfolios for investments in the Trust or
merge two or more existing portfolios. Shareholders' investments
in such a portfolio would be evidenced by a separate series of
shares. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each Fund is further divided into three classes of
shares designated as Institutional Shares, Adviser Shares and
Select Shares. Each class of shares of each Fund represents interests
in the assets of that Fund and has identical dividend, liquidation
and other rights and the same terms and conditions except that
expenses, if any, related to the distribution and shareholder
servicing of a particular class are borne solely by such class
and each class may, at the Trustees' discretion, also pay a different
share of other expenses, not including advisory or custodial fees
or other expenses related to the management of the Trust's assets,
if these expenses are actually incurred in a different amount
by that class, or if the class receives services of a different
kind or to a different degree than the other classes. All other
expenses are allocated to each class on the basis of the net asset
value of that class in relation to the net asset value of the
particular Fund. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each class of shares of each Fund has identical voting
rights except that each class has exclusive voting rights on any
matter submitted to shareholders that relates solely to that class,
and has separate voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders
in which the interests of one class differ from the interests
of any other class. Each class of shares has exclusive voting
rights with respect to matters pertaining to any distribution
or servicing plan applicable to that class. Matters submitted
to shareholder vote must be approved by each Fund separately except
(i)&nbsp;when required by the Investment Company Act of 1940,
all shares shall be voted together and (ii)&nbsp;when the Trustees
have determined that the matter does not affect all Funds, then
only shareholders of the Fund or Funds affected shall be entitled
to vote on the matter. All three classes of shares of a Fund will
vote together, except with respect to any distribution or servicing
plan applicable to a class or when a class vote is required as
specified above or otherwise by the Investment Company Act of
1940. Shares are freely transferable, are entitled to dividends
as declared by the Trustees and, in liquidation of a Fund portfolio,
are entitled to receive the net assets of that portfolio, but
not of the other Funds. The Trust does not generally hold annual
meetings of shareholders and will do so only when required by
law. Shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares
may remove trustees from office by votes cast in person or by
proxy at a meeting of shareholders or by written consent. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Declaration of Trust provides for the perpetual
existence of the Trust. The Trust, may, however, be terminated
at any time by vote of at least two&#173;thirds of the outstanding
shares of the Trust. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Shareholders could, under certain circumstances,
be held personally liable for the obligations of the Trust. However,
the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account
of that liability is considered remote since it may arise only
in very limited circumstances. </FONT>
