	<strong><CENTER>GTS DURATEK'S SUBSIDIARY DURATHERM </center>
<center>RECEIVES RECYCLING APPROVAL </CENTER></strong>
<br><BR>
<p>COLUMBIA, Md. -- GTS Duratek (Nasdaq:  DRTK) today announced that its 80% owned-subsidiary, DuraTherm, Inc., received official notification from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), approving the recycling of the residues from the thermal desorption process into prefabricated concrete building products.  Recycling eliminates the need for costly disposal of the process residue as hazardous waste.  This improvement significantly lowers overall operating costs and produces a useful product.<br>

<p>Robert Hensel, President, DuraTherm said, "This will provide our customers with a unique opportunity to have their listed waste residues incorporated into a recycled product that will not be subject to RCRA regulations.  We have also recently developed the ability to process more difficult waste streams, broadening the range of waste that we are able to accept from our customers."<br>

<p>Robert E. Prince, President, GTS Duratek said, "DuraTherm can now recycle a process waste residue into a useful product, that has historically cost over $100 a ton for disposal in a hazardous waste landfill.  Not only is it good for the environment to recycle this residue, it is also good business."  <br>

<p>DuraTherm, Inc.  provides solutions for refinery waste disposal using its patented thermal desorption process.  GTS Duratek is an environmental technology and services firm that uses its proprietary vitrification processes to convert radioactive and hazardous waste into glass for long-term storage and disposal.<br>
