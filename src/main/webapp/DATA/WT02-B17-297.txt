<P>There are some 97 million U.S. households - single family homes, multifamily dwellings, and mobile homes. The Energy Information Administration's 1993 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) covered a representative sample of over 7 thousand of these households. The most recent in a series of nationwide energy consumption surveys begun in 1978, the 1993 RECS includes new, detailed information about new home construction, emerging technologies, indoor and outdoor lighting, household appliances, equipment replacements, and energy efficiency measures. It also updates previous survey data, including information on air-conditioning and residential vehicles.
