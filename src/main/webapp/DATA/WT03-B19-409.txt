<H1>The Intergovernmental Negociating 
Committee<BR>
for a Framework Convention<BR>
on Climate Change (INC/FCCC)</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (INC/FCCC) was established to draft a legally binding climate 
treaty.</B>  By 1990, numerous international conferences had issued urgent calls for a 
binding global treaty addressing the problem of climate change.  The United Nations 
Environment Programme(UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization WMO) 
responded by establishing an intergovernmental working group to prepare for treaty 
negotiations.1 Meeting in September 1990 to discuss the format for the negotiations, the 
group proposed that all negotiations under UN auspices take place within a single forum.2  
<A HREF = "fs205.html">The UN General Assembly</A> 
confirmed this proposal in 1990 and set up the INC to draft a framework convention, as 
well as any related legal instruments it considered necessary.3<P>
<B>The INC was given the formidable task of having an "effective" Convention 
ready in time for <A HREF = "fs207.html">the Rio 
"Earth Summit"</A> in June 1992</B>.  The UN General Assembly established a 
Trust Fund to cover the costs of the INC's work as well as a Special Voluntary Fund to 
enable developing countries to participate.  The INC became the central forum for the 
international effort to develop a climate treaty, with some 150 states and numerous 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations participating in the 
negotiations.<B> </B> The Climate Convention was negotiated during five sessions 
between February 1991 and May 1992.  This rapid progress was possible in part because 
the ground had been prepared by <A HREF = "fs208.html">the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</A>, whose First Assessment Report 
served as a basis for the INC's work, as well as by international meetings such as <A 
HREF = "fs221.html">the Second World Climate 
Conference</A>.  The treaty was drafted by two working groups established by the INC 
at its first session.  The groups met in parallel and submitted draft treaty elements to the 
plenary.  Working Group I elaborated elements relating to commitments, while Working 
Group II focused on legal and institutional mechanisms.<P>
<B>The negotiators had to decide whether the Convention should contain specific 
implementation mechanisms and commitments for limiting emissions or only basic 
obligations and general principles.</B>  Some states argued that specific 
emissions-control measures could be included later in protocols, as was done with <A 
HREF = "fs224.html">the Vienna Convention and its Montreal 
Protocol</A>.  Others, fearing that such protocols would be long in  materialising, urged 
that concrete measures be incorporated into the Convention itself.  The question of 
different standards for different categories of countries was also discussed.  Many 
developing countries were prepared to agree to specific commitments as long as they 
applied primarily to industrialised countries.<P>
<B>The issue of emissions targets for <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gases</A>, especially carbon 
dioxide (C02), was vigorously debated.  </B>Although the IPCC report had concluded 
that a 60-80% reduction of CO2 emissions would be needed to stabilise atmospheric 
concentrations, the strongest proposal considered by the INC was to freeze CO2 
emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  This proposal was put forward by the 
European Community and supported by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and 
by some EFTA states.  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and some Nordic states 
supported stabilisation of emissions of <I>all</I> GHGs not controlled by the Montreal 
Protocol (notably <A HREF = "fs031.html">CFCs</A>), while 
the US and the oil-producing OPEC states opposed the inclusion of any specific emission 
targets in the Convention.  (The final agreed text refers to the desirability of developed 
countries returning to earlier emissions levels but does not specify a firm target.)  There 
was also some discussion about how emission targets, if any, should be defined, and about 
the possibility of allowing groups of states to jointly implement such targets.<P>
<B>There was general agreement on the need for financial and technical assistance 
to developing countries. </B> Many developing countries pushed for an obligation to 
provide financial assistance from "new and additional sources" to prevent money simply 
being diverted from existing funding sources.  They also argued that technology should be 
provided on preferential, non-commercial terms.  Some industrialised countries, however, 
did not want to be pinned down to such commitments.<P>
<B>The negotiators had to choose between establishing a new financial mechanism 
for the Convention or using the existing Global Environment Facility (GEF). </B> 
The first option, prompted by concerns over the GEF and the way it is administered, was 
supported by virtually all developing countries.  Some industrialised countries, however, 
argued that the creation of a new institution would generate additional and unnecessary 
bureaucracy.  In the end, it was agreed that the GEF would operate the Convention's 
financial mechanism on an interim basis and be accountable to the Conference of the 
Parties.<P>
<B>By agreeing to compromise solutions for these contentious issues, the INC 
negotiators were able to adopt the <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">Climate Change Convention</A> on 9 May 
1992.  </B>The fifth and last session of INC was held in two parts separated by  a few 
weeks to enable states to complete the work.  In most areas of disagreement, solutions 
were found somewhere between the initial opposing viewpoints.  After being adopted by 
the INC, the Convention was signed at UNCED by 154 states and <A HREF = 
"fs211.html">the EC</A>, demonstrating a wide acceptance of 
the INC's work.  Additional states have signed since then, and a growing number have 
ratified.  The treaty will enter into force three months after the 50th ratification, and within 
one year of the entry into force the first session of the Conference of the Parties will be 
held.<P>
<B>During the current interim phase the INC is preparing for the first session of 
the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.</B>4<B> </B> It will be assisted by 
an interim secretariat in Geneva.  The INC held its sixth session in Geneva on 7-10 
December 1992, its seventh in New York on 15-20 March 1993,5 and has scheduled its 
eighth session in Geneva on 16-27 August 1993.  Until the Convention enters into force, 
probably in early 1994, the INC will continue preparing for the communication and review 
of information as called for by the treaty, monitoring the interim arrangements involving 
the IPCC and the GEF, and overseeing technical and financial support to developing 
countries.  The INC will be dissolved when the Conference of the Parties first meets and 
begins the lengthy process of implementing the Convention.<P>
