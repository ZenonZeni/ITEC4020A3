<P>
Those older men and women exercising structural and moral authority
(Paterson, 1966), often called collectively the Establishment,
have been alarmed by psychedelics for rather less than five years.
Their attitude might be described in the terms Aneurin Bevan used
for an old man approaching a young bride: &quot;. . . fascinated,
sluggish, and apprehensive.&quot; The impetuous young, however,
always at the heart of any anti-establishment movement, rush in
with all the rash ardor of Romeo and Juliet. Medical men, though
less worried about morals or legality, are properly concerned
with the health of the young lovers, and have been debating, not
without acrimony, whether the entrancing psychedelic bride is
a delicious and sexy houri or a poxy doxy.
<P>
This fascination of older folk with psychedelics and the climate
attached to them becomes evident in the propaganda devoted to
them by many government agencies, professional associations, and
other interested people. While this has been aimed ostensibly
at discouraging the young from taking or continuing to take these
substances, the means employed seem unlikely to achieve such an
end. The cause of pornography has frequently been well served
by those whose strident warnings abjured others from seeking what,
until then, they had hardly noticed. Public men have, quite unwittingly,
by their ignorance, evasion, and downright lies, egged on their
children and grandchildren to explore these experiences. It appears
sometimes as if they were trying to discredit themselves in the
eyes of the young. It may not be their intention, but it seems
to be their achievement.
<P>
Our connection with this intergenerational controversy began about
sixteen years ago, when one of us, after a troubled night, was
standing at a table stirring a glass of water in which silvery
white crystals were dissolving with an oily slick. Would it be
enough or too much? He was uneasy: he would be disappointed if
nothing happened, but what if the mescaline worked too well? Suppose
he poured half of the full glass into an adjacent flower vase?
He did not relish the possibility, however remote, of finding
a small, but discreditable niche in literary history as the man
who drove Aldous Huxley mad. His fears proved groundless. Although
the bitter chemical did not work as quickly as he had expected,
in due course it etched away the patina of conceptual thinking.
<P>
Much has happened since that smogless May morning in Hollywood.
Neither Aldous Huxley nor he would have predicted that <I>The
Doors of Perception</I> (1954) was going to have such an immense
impact on an ever-increasing number of people. Those substances,
then known as hallucinogens or psychotomimetics, and which he
later called psychedelics (Osmond, 1957b), have, for good or evil,
become far more widely known and no longer the concern merely
of the specialist and scholar. They are part of our vocabulary,
a source of both vexation and inspiration.
<P>
Less than ten years after the senior author's spring visit to
Hollywood, Pandora's box was unexpectedly opened. Since then,
members of the Establishment have been sitting on the lid of the
empty box, unaware that this posture is both undignified and futile.
It is the fate of establishments to be taken by surprise in spite
of ample and repeated warnings. Once they have become aware that
something is amiss, they often act precipitately, with little
forethought or caution, and transform a minor inconvenience or
even possible benefits into catastrophe. There was plenty of warning
that psychedelics were apt to be of interest to people and also
to become more available so that this long-standing human taste
could be indulged more easily. It required no gift of prophecy
to recognize this, for history shows that man has been an inveterate
experimenter with chemicals, usually derived from plants, that
make him happier or livelier, or alter his perceptions and awareness.
In his sumptuous and magnificent book <I>Soma: Divine Mushroom
of Immortality</I> (1969), for example, R. Gordon Wasson, the
mycologist-scholar, has shown convincingly that the <I>Rig Veda</I>,
one of the oldest and greatest of man's religious works, devoted
about one tenth of its collection of over one thousand psalms
to celebrating the plant god Soma. Wasson, with wonderful persistence,
caution, and intuition, makes a good case for soma being the mushroom
<I>Amanita muscaria</I>, or fly agaric, the classic toadstool
of the birch forests of the world. Psychedelics are a very ancient
and influential human interest.
<P>
What has the Establishment been doing about them? If one had listened
only to its members from a recent president on down, one might
have been convinced that psychedelics had no future at all because
of the development of ever-growing and increasingly specialized
law- enforcement agencies to remove the nuisance permanently.
In the past year or two, the tone has changed somewhat, along
with other overoptimistic estimates. On the other hand, if one
listened only to supporters of the psychedelic movement, one might
be led to suppose that an age was borning in which from earliest
childhood, and possibly the prenatal state, we would all be exposed
to the delights and virtues of wholly beneficial substances. The
facts do not support either of these extreme positions, but extreme
positions rarely depend on facts. Long before the official Establishment
had asked itself what sort of problem it might be facing, legislation
was being prepared, bills hurriedly passed, statements of an alarming
kind made, and vigorous legal and police action taken. This was
not admirable, but it was no more admirable of the psychedelic
movement to imply that there were scarcely any dangers attendant
on these remarkable substances and that we should all hasten along
the road to the &quot;joyous cosmology,&quot; taking anything
anyone offered, and trusting it would be enough, and not too much.
<P>
The Establishment's posture is not difficult to understand, for
it is that of all establishments everywhere when faced with innovation.
It consists in saying, &quot;No, you don't. Father (or Grandfather)
knows best. Be good and do as you are told, for if you don't,
it will be the worse for you.&quot; Before planning and passing
legislation or developing new policing procedures, it might seem
prudent to assess the effectiveness of such actions, and consider
whether police activities might not have unintended consequences
as bad as or worse than the evils to be remedied. This is especially
true in the United States, where prohibition, with all its admirable
intentions, merely provided a golden opportunity for gangsters
to become multimillionaires and spread the habit the legislation
was intended to curb. The most likely outcome of prohibition in
the early twenties was that, since many people did not feel that
drinking alcohol was immoral, even though it might have become
illegal, the law would be widely subverted. Criminals would then
have an opportunity to provide these disaffected citizens with
their needs. The police would be liable to be corrupted, the law
itself brought into disrepute, and because most people would come
to feel that prohibition itself is a farce, they would tend to
consider that the law is a racket, too. This is a high price to
pay for an unattainable social benefit.
<P>
Other legislation aimed at preventing people from taking substances,
such as psychedelics, that they want to take should surely be
examined in this context. As we have noted, this is an interest
that men have pursued for millennia with great persistence and
in a variety of ways, ranging from self-inflicted tortures and
austerities to taking dangerous substances. Drugs are only one
of many possible ways of achieving these experiences, and are
by no means the most objectionable from a medical viewpoint. From
earliest times, psychedelics have been regarded as strange and
sacred and have been part of many great religious ceremonies.
They are certainly as enduring and interesting for mankind as
alcohol, although, since the rise of modern agriculture, alcohol
has been probably easier to obtain. On the other hand, cannabis
has been used for many centuries. It may not be a simple matter
to head off people's interest in psychedelics; it has not been
easy to head off interest in alcohol. Had it been possible to
prevent people from making alcoholic drinks, prohibition would
have been feasible. As it was, everyone could make his own fermented
drink in the bathtub, and before long, the well-meant laws to
curb drinking had become meaningless and socially harmful.
<P>
In 1966, the government did not seem to have considered these
early experiences much, and appeared to believe that by preventing
Sandoz from manufacturing and distributing LSD to research workers,
the problem would soon be resolved. Indeed, one of us was told
by an aide of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy that the ex-Attorney
General of the United States was surprised to learn &quot;that
preventing Sandoz from selling LSD (which, of course, they were
not doing, but giving it away only to accredited researchers)
would not resolve the problem. &quot;Even though Senator Kennedy
was a young, active, and unusually well-informed man, he was ignorant
of this, although he quickly acquired the necessary information.
The elderly men who govern most countries apparently failed to
ask or have impressed upon them the questions facing those who
wish to control the use of psychedelics.
<P>
During World War II, British and American intelligence services
briefed their generals by first giving an opinion as to what was
most likely to happen, followed by a statement of what they considered
the best possible outcome in the circumstances, and finally, the
worst possible construction. The general officer, knowing the
conclusion of his intelligence service, could then make his own
decision, basing it on optimism, pessimism, or a middle way, as
he saw fit. Suppose it had been our task to advise statesmen on
the future of psychedelic substances, what would we have told
them, assuming that we knew that they were already more or less
limited to a policy of control? From this point of view, the best
possible thing that could happen would be for people to lose interest
in psychedelics once and for all, and for the sources of supply
to dry up forever. The worst that could happen for the Establishment
would be for supplies of psychedelics to become greater and easier
to make in a climate of sustained or increasing interest, thus
producing a situation resembling prohibition at its worst.
<P>
How would these two extreme estimates relate to the most likely
outcomes It would be surprising if an interest so long sustained
ever disappears completely. Indeed, our age is one in which interest
in these matters seems more likely to increase. Today, at least
in North America and Europe, there are larger numbers of highly
mobile young people, many of them fairly well-to-do, than ever
before in history. Most have been reared with less severity than
previous generations and have largely escaped the terrible blows
that death, illness, starvation, and poverty frequently inflict
on the young. They are sufficiently uncowed by the world to be
highly critical of how it is run, and have the energy, time, and
opportunity to express dissatisfaction and explore new ways of
improving matters. Their education has taught them how to use
libraries and other modern information-retrieval systems. Many
of them became interested in psychedelics in the early sixties,
and while this preoccupation may fluctuate, it seems unlikely
that it will disappear completely. The interest of the Indians
in drugs survived the full force of the Spanish Inquisition, and
it is unlikely that even the severest legislators intend to emulate
that mighty institution in policing their children and grandchildren.
<P>
In addition, with regard to the control of the substances themselves,
more have been discovered and rediscovered during the past decade
and a half than in any similar period in history. It seems likely
that more will be found during the next ten years. Some of these
will be discovered in plants and others synthesized. Every discovery
makes it easier to suggest not only new places in which to look
for active substances, but also new ways of making them. We predict
that within the next twenty-five years, and perhaps sooner, simple
processes will be discovered by which reasonably safe psychedelics
can be made in any kitchen or basement with materials available
in stores, pharmacies, and fields or gardens. Some believe the
best way to avoid these dangers would be to stop all research
on psychedelics. In our opinion, this would be objectionable,
since these substances have great interest for psychology and
psychiatry and since there is, as we have shown here, growing
evidence of their therapeutic usefulness. It would also not succeed
in stopping the clandestine experiments in the synthesis or use
of these substances, for forbidden fruits not only taste sweeter,
but develop an esoteric interest. Presumably this &quot;occult&quot;
science, because it would be &quot;illegal,&quot; would not be
published in official scientific journals. A sort of underground
science would develop, which at least would be deplorable, and
might be very dangerous.
<P>
In our imaginary briefings, the statesmen would be told that the
most likely outcome during the next decade would be that the interest
in these substances would be maintained, though it is likely to
fluctuate from year to year. Although a number of new psychedelics
will be discovered, there is no convincing evidence that the era
of &quot;bathtub&quot; psychedelics has yet arrived, allowing
them to be made in ease and safety at home. Should this occur,
the resulting situation will resemble that of prohibition.
<P>
Statesmen must surely ask themselves whether it is wise to invent
new crimes or inflate misdemeanors into matters of great importance.
The roster of criminal law is large; by adding new laws that are
difficult to enforce, respect for the law may be decreased. Certain
kinds of new laws may be expensive luxuries that societies in
the course of change simply cannot afford. We believe that the
interest in psychedelics will be maintained in the foreseeable
future. If police and similar agencies devote much of their energy
to controlling the substances, the overt interest may become less
conspicuous. Prosecuting people does not necessarily change their
opinions, but may invest forbidden activity with glamour and make
those undertaking it discreet. It is said that crime has been
increasing greatly in recent years, and one wonders whether this
is a propitious time to add a whole new series of crimes to the
burden of an already overladen police and magistracy.
<P>
Already there are laws of such severity on the statute books that
judges, juries, and police often shy away from using them, although,
from time to time, unlucky people receive very harsh punishment,
which seems unfair both to them and to their contemporaries. It
seems unlikely that occasional severities will do much to change
the general picture. However, in politics as elsewhere, men have
rarely shown a sense of history or adequate foresight, and the
same legislators who promise a tough line against psychedelics
talk blithely about reducing the voting age to eighteen. If these
statements are sincere, and they plan to continue their opposition
to psychedelics when they have reduced the voting age, one wonders
whether we are not becoming tired of politics.
<P>
In our opinion, the Establishment has behaved as establishments
usually do, bolstered with the authority they possess by virtue
of their social and political position. They have not been any
less admirable than members of the psychedelic movement who claim
that as a result of their experiences they have a deeper knowledge
of the human heart and a greater understanding of the meaning
of things. By their claims, their actions must be judged by a
higher standard than the actions of the Establishment, which does
not make such claims. If one asks whether mind-expanding experiences
have increased the ability of members of the psychedelic movement
to understand the views and fears of their elders more compassionately
than they feel they themselves have been judged, we believe the
verdict must be &quot;not proven.&quot; Aldous Huxley once urged
a leading figure in the psychedelic movement to remember that
it is &quot;important to do good stealthily.&quot; His excellent
advice has not always been heeded. If indeed insights have been
acquired as a result of psychedelic experience, they should be
used for the general good rather than for personal ends.
<P>
In this controversy, medical men have tended to be ranged on the
side of the Establishment. This is understandable enough, for
they are frequently closely associated with it, and often among
its members. Unfortunately, they sometimes use their enormous
medical authority to justify prejudices deriving not from medical
knowledge, but from the social and moral climate in which they
happen to live. This has occurred repeatedly throughout history,
and the same error has been made by some of the most distinguished
medical men.
<P>
An excellent example of this is provided by the case of Henry
Maudsley, one of the most enlightened psychiatrists of his day,
and for whom a leading mental hospital in London is presently
named. In his fine paper &quot;Masturbational Insanity,&quot;
E. H. Hare (1962) notes that Maudsley wrote, &quot;In the life
of the chronic masturbator, nothing could be so reasonably desired
as the end of it, and the sooner he sinks to his degraded rest
the better for himself, and the better for the world, which is
well rid of him.&quot; Hare comments on this, &quot;. . . the
besetting sin of the psychiatrist [is] a tendency to confuse the
rules of mental health with morality.&quot; Maudsley's views were
part of the conventional wisdom of his age. Even as late as 1892,
the Dictionary of Psychological Medicine described the effects
of masturbation as &quot;moral and mental shipwreck, the whole
nature is deteriorated.... mental faculties become blunted....
The miserable wretch would commit suicide if he dared, but rarely
has the courage . . . and sinks into melancholic dementia.&quot;
Writing in 1911 on the treatment and prevention of this grievous
condition, Ivan Bloch stated, &quot;In the treatment of masturbation,
the methods of the older physicians who appeared before the child
armed with great knives and scissors and threatened a painful
operation or even to cut off the genital organs may often be used
and often effect a radical cure.&quot; Psychoanalysts, too, were
involved in this nonsense. Ernest Jones, the biographer of Freud,
for instance, wrote in 1918 that neurasthenia derived from excessive
onanism and seminal emission (Comfort, 1967).
<P>
Masturbation was of no interest to medicine until about 1720,
following the publication in 1710 of a book called <I>Onania,
or the Heinous Sin of Self-Abuse</I>, to tout a patent medicine.
Indeed, in 1644, masturbation was recommended as a remedy against
&quot;the dangerous allurements of women.&quot; After the publication
of Onania, the negative view taken up by medical men and educators
became the source of some of the most harmful iatrogenic miseries,
exceeded only by the great nineteenth-century pandemic of bleeding.
Right up to the 1930S, in both England and the United States,
extraordinary garments, a combination of straitjacket and chastity
belt, were sold by makers of surgical and medical instruments
to curb &quot;the deadly vice of onanism.&quot;
<P>
What relevance has this to psychedelics? Medicine, in its views,
is in tune with the morality of the age in which it is practiced,
and indeed, has been more or less identified with morality for
millennia. Medical men have to choose a middle course to avoid
overidentifcation with the establishments of their day. Medical
men who went along with the Nazi race theories are one dismal
example of how current social values can destroy medical ethics.
In the case of masturbation, physical and psychological injury
was inflicted on at least six generations of children and adults.
Panic and terror spread among parents who were urged to be ever
alert to spot young masturbators. Children became morbidly preoccupied
with this attractive but deadly vice which excited the grownups
to such frenzy.
<P>
Perhaps we are about to indulge in yet another of these medicomoral
autos-da-f&eacute;. The sequence of events is easy to spot. First,
a few medical men associate themselves with a particular moral
viewpoint that they consider has some medical importance. They
soon find evidence, sometimes dubious, to confirm their convictions.
Using this evidence, they begin to suggest solving the moral problem
by medical means. In the psychedelic context, users have been
infringing on the contention of the medical establishment that
any pharmacological substances used on human beings lie within
its bailiwick. The psychological changes resulting from drug use
are those older folk frown upon and sometimes find repugnant and
frightening, in contrast with such acceptable social tranquilizers
as alcohol or barbiturates. There is also the possibility that
those who use psychedelics might be injuring themselves or their
offspring. The recent impassioned discussions of the possible
effects of LSD on chromosomes is paralleled by similar discussions
over masturbation. It was stated with the utmost confidence that
not only would the secret vice result in the collapse and insanity
of those who practiced it, but should they be unfortunate enough
to survive to adulthood, their children would suffer for their
sins. There was no evidence for this, but it did not prevent men
of the highest integrity from stating that it was undoubtedly
so.
<P>
There are real dangers associated with the psychedelic substances
known today. These dangers are of many kinds and call for concern
from medicine and its allied sciences. However, before discussing
these dangers and how they might be alleviated, it may be well
to remind those who urge medical men to make public pronouncements
to frighten and dismay the young that, given the morality of medicine,
its place in society, and the age of the experienced medical man,
the doctor is rarely the best person for the task. He is liable
to exaggerate such dangers as exist and is apt to aid and abet
extreme measures, in keeping with the morality of the day, that
may not alleviate the sufferings of the victims of the immoral
condition and may even make it worse.
<P>
Psychedelics are liable to arouse moral indignation, because emotions
are always likely to be deeply stimulated when someone else is
indulging in new pleasures that may alter social values, especially
when the users are young and rash and often brash as well. Medicine
has a duty not to make this confusion and uncertainty any worse.
Physicians are not police. Their duty is to inform the public
as truthfully as they can, without excessive bias, resounding
moral statements, or validation of punitive actions carried out
as treatment. Medicine must avoid becoming a precipitate partisan
in complex moral and social issues such as those posed by the
modern advent of psychedelics.
<P>
After such perplexities, it is tempting to leave the solution
to the reader's ingenuity. Yet authors customarily give their
opinion and venture at least a few steps beyond the threshold
of their ivory tower. The uses and dangers attending these substances
must be discussed accurately and dispassionately. Men like Dr.
Stanley Yolles, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health,
do not seem convinced that &quot;drug abuse,&quot; which includes
the unauthorized use of a variety of psychedelics, will be eliminated
in the foreseeable <A NAME="back1"></A>future. <A HREF="#footnote1">(1)</A>
If this is indeed so, strenuous efforts must be made to reduce
those dangers attendant on clandestine use. We require a variety
of social strategies rather than freezing in a catatonic posture
and boasting that this immobility is firm resolution. The very
brief banning of LSD-25 research in 1966 was a classic example
of precipitate, unintelligent action springing from high government
levels. Since then, some research has been restored to a limited
degree, but expansion has not been greatly encouraged, nor is
an atmosphere of panic and politicking conducive to clear thinking,
planning, and diligent, long-continued inquiry. Legitimate, rather
than amateur and bootleg, research is necessary; yet one of the
most gifted and distinguished researchers in the country was not
able to obtain permission to do this sort of work. Others, too,
have been discouraged by the sluggishness of the various bureaucracies
that must be consulted.
<P>
The muddled and ambiguous situation regarding the effect of LSD-25
on chromosomes<A NAME="back2"></A> <A HREF="#footnote2">(2)</A>
might call for restriction of research with this particular drug
to those people for whom such changes, if they do indeed occur,
would be of comparatively little importance. Other psychedelics,
which have never been implicated in this way, could be used more
widely. Subjects for LSD might include some of the several million
afflicted by severe and chronic alcoholism, patients suffering
from intractable pain in fatal illnesses (Kast, 1964a), and older
people still curious for new experience to enlarge their understanding
of themselves, others, and existence. While not everyone might
choose to die with his mind stimulated by LSD, as did Aldous Huxley
(Huxley, L. A., 1968), rather than dulled by morphine, such matters
call for careful consideration, for each of us owes God a death.
It is folly to restrict and hamper research in all directions
because it may be dangerous in some. If damage to chromosomes
should be proved, and this has not yet been done, some substances
may be less harmful than others, and it may be possible to discover
protective measures. As a number of medicines in regular use are
also suspect, and since some virus diseases and certain radiations
produce similar changes, inquiries here would serve a wider purpose.
Indeed, because of the possibility of chromosome-damaging substances
in various medicines and foods, it would be prudent to inquire
at once into such protective substances. For instance, it has
been shown (in animals) that the teratogenic effect of thalidomide
(Frank et al., 1963) can be prevented by greatly increasing the
intake of niacin (vitamin B3). It is not known if this protective
effect extends to humans, but if it does, the thalidomide tragedy,
in which so many babies were deformed, might have been simply
and cheaply avoided.
<P>
Many years ago, Carl Jung <A NAME="back3"></A><A HREF="#footnote3">(3)</A>
told one of us that by the middle years of life, childhood experience
had usually done its worst and became of lessened importance as
a source of intrapsychic distress. Queen Elizabeth I put it to
her godson, Sir John Harrington, who invented the water closet,
&quot;When thou dost feel creeping time at the gate, these fooleries
will please thee less.&quot; She also reflected, &quot;The days
of man's life are plumed with the feathers of death.&quot; As
the years pass by, many men and women become more concerned with
the purpose and meaning of life, rather than with the drive to
succeed in it. This is an important area of inquiry for psychedelic
research.
<P>
Just as important, and at present receiving just as little attention,
is our need to explore ways to help people prepare themselves
for the rapid, all-pervasive, social and technological changes
characteristic of our times. In terms of science and technology,
as compared with previous ages, many of us have lived through
the equivalent of centuries of change. This torrent of change
is itself anxiety provoking, for there are no structures to handle
the kinds of change that change the structures themselves. Few
moralists seem to have noticed yet that the progress of medicine
has made it harder for us to reflect upon death and so savor life
to the full. To come to terms with both life and death, each must
be measured with the cold eye of the reflective mind; change must
be faced.
<P>
Until about half a century ago, everyone everywhere was raised
in the ever-present shadow of death. The autobiographies, biographies,
and histories of forty years ago show that those plumed feathers
were never far away. Life and death were inseparables, the subject
of gossip and conversation. Many people were preparing themselves
for their own deaths all their lives, for, unhampered by insurance
statistics, they saw death as ever present. Death seems to have
become taboo today and has taken that place of secrecy from which
sex has just been freed. This exchange of prisoners seems hardly
worth while. It is usually possible to abstain from sex, should
one want to; death allows no abstentions. As a Ghanaian truck
driver put it, &quot;Death takes no bribes.&quot;
<P>
A generation has grown up in whose life death is an unfamiliar
and unnatural event, almost an affront. Their experience does
not countenance illness for which nothing can be done. But death
has only been postponed, not defeated, and has dominion over people
who have scarcely dared speak his name in polite company. Our
forebears linked holy living and holy dying, and considered the
two an art. In a society such as ours, which has become almost
idolatrous about living indefinitely, it is becoming bad taste
to discuss death. Our position is not unlike that in Victorian
love stories, in which the authors managed to write about love
and passion with few open references to sex7 although its absence
made its presence all the clearer.
<P>
Those concerned with the religious aspects of psychedelics should
make special efforts in this direction. Many members of the Establishment
are in their middle and later years, and there is little doubt
that they recognize that they &quot;owe God a death,&quot; in
spite of the efforts of their physicians and surgeons. Research
into these matters should be pursued with ardor, for while the
risks are small, the rewards are likely to be great. This still
leaves the question of whether these substances have ill effects
on the young and whether such ill effects can be much reduced,
easily corrected, or completely avoided. Since controlling the
manufacture, distribution, and use of psychedelics is still uncertain,
although their containment seems to be possible, at least for
the moment, even this might break down during the next few years,
as we noted earlier.
<P>
If Victor Gioscia (1969) is correct, and there is an LSD subculture,
the dangers, particularly to those under thirty, require very
careful consideration. Leaving out chromosome damage, perhaps
the most dramatic misfortune is the development of a schizophreniform
illness. There is no doubt that this can happen, though it is
not clear how often it does. Certain myths current among some
young drug takers increase the danger. One of the most unfortunate
is that the appropriate remedy for a bad trip is another one,
frequently with a larger dose than that which produced the first
one. This notion is on a par with the alcoholic slogan of having
a hair, or even the tail, of &quot;the dog that bit you.&quot;
The sensible response to a bad trip is not to have another, but
to seek competent advice and guidance without delay. Some people,
who are clearly developing schizophrenia and have disturbances
of perception (Hoffer and Osmond, 1966a) combined with usually
depressed mood changes, with anxiety and sometimes thinking difficulties,
take psychedelics because they have heard, or hope, that they
will help. The most probable outcome is a severe and prolonged
bad trip, or sometimes the precipitation of a more-severe and
acute illness. If these dangers were more widely known and understood,
many young people would avoid trying to treat themselves by these
desperate means and avoid much unhappiness and distress.
<P>
A number of simple and effective ways of exploring and measuring
perceptual anomalies, including the HOD (Hoffer and Osmond, 1961;
Kelm, Hoffer, and Osmond, 1967) and EWI (El-Meligi, l968a, 1968b;
El-Meligi and Osmond, in press) tests already exist. By means
of these and similar instruments, and by improving public knowledge
about schizophrenia, it should be possible to diagnose and treat
it far earlier and more successfully than usually happens today.
Delaying treatment or aggravating the condition with mixtures
of impure and often unknown chemicals in inept attempts at self-treatment
only makes things worse. However, by no means all, or even most,
who sample the bewildering array of often dubious substances said
to be psychedelic become gravely ill or likely to be so. Official
propaganda paints a uniformly gloomy picture, which paradoxically
increases rashness by its exaggeration. This same kind of overstatement
was used to discourage masturbation, sex, drinking, dancing, smoking,
using make-up, primping, and other disapproved activities. The
results have been unimpressive. However, even if it were shown
that there were few physiological objections to young people taking
pure and reliable psychedelics except for those with a tendency
to schizophrenia, it does not follow that all controls should
be removed.
<P>
Each one of us must learn his own culture before he can either
align himself with its values or object to them in a manner likely
to produce constructive change. In most cultures, the attainment
of this is symbolized by the accordance of certain rights, such
as the right to marry, hold property, vote, go to war, receive
the death penalty, and other positive and negative awards withheld
from children and those not sufficiently acculturated. In some
cultures, ceremonies take place to mark entry into adult status,
and ritual markings may also be applied in order to indicate the
status of the new adult. Psychedelics taken before the stabilization
of knowledge about cultural norms, because of their capacity to
alter perceptual constancy, might result in a reduced capacity
or wish to internalize the already fluctuating and fragmenting
values of our industrial society. The Establishment, by its hasty
and apparently not fully enforceable ban on these substances,
seems to have worsened matters by making them symbolic of intergenerational
differences.
<P>
Since the mistake has already been made, what can be done? Societies
that have sought and used psychedelic experience, however achieved,
have nearly always had some kind of initiation ceremony, often
of a religious kind, aimed at focusing expanded experience in
a way that will enhance the participant's identification with
and appreciation of his own society. In the United States at present,
only indigenous Indians are permitted a religion employing psychedelics,
and they have achieved this only by much stubborn courage. Surely
bona fide religious groups interested in these matters who are
prepared to conduct themselves in a manner in keeping with safety
and public decency, should be encouraged and supported. They are
likely to serve a valuable social function in the future. Even
the cynical who are not wholly myopic can understand that banned
and persecuted religions frequently spread more quickly and become
more attractive in times of change. Persecution, even with the
good intention of preserving health, is liable to have unintended
consequences. In his morality <I>Island</I>, Aldous Huxley (1962)
discussed these matters and illustrated them with the learning,
perceptiveness, wit, and delicacy in which he had few rivals.
<P>
Mankind's interest in the psychedelic experience is unlikely to
lessen with increase in leisure. This gives us a greater opportunity
to be concerned not only with survival, but with the quality of
those human relationships that are the stuff of life. Wasson (1969)
shows in his great book that this is one of mankind's oldest interests.
In the years that lie ahead, new drugs, although there will probably
be many more of them, will not, we think, be the focus of greatest
interest. Already various forms of hypnosis, learning-theory applications,
and electronics that evoke and reproduce these experiences are
being explored. Those young people who are alert to them and interested
will learn how to use them, and some may be doing so even now.
If this happens, the Establishment will have to decide whether
it disapproves of the chemicals producing the experience or the
experience itself. Very few of those dealing with these matters
legally, scientifically, or politically seem to have concerned
themselves with this critical issue. Medically, the non-drug methods
eliminate many of the current objections to the psychedelic experience
as a hazard to health. The social problems, however, especially
those of acculturation, would not necessarily be greatly changed
.
<P>
If such capacities, however induced, become widespread, their
impact is likely to resemble some massive mutation. Perhaps this
is necessary if we are to adapt to that new world that we are
building with such a strange mishmash of cunning, inspiration,
apprehension, and folly. The sociological, psychological, political,
and other consequences of psychedelic experience, however induced,
occurring in the majority or even a substantial minority of a
postindustrial population, is likely to affect most of us far
more than a few space jaunts for carefully selected heroes and
heroines. The record is merciless: practical men of sound sense
are nearly always wrong about the future, though never lacking
in certainty. While the winds of change strum to gale force around
us, they perform their ostrich acts and proclaim that they have
everything under control. But the gale does not blow itself out
because of their rhetoric, and to survive, we need to set a course
that carries us into the future. Some years ago one of us wrote
(Osmond, 1957a):

. . . these agents have a part to play in our survival as a species,
for that survival depends as much On our opinion of our fellows
and ourselves as on any other single thing. The psychedelics help
us to explore and fathom our own nature.

We can perceive ourselves as the stampings of an automatic socioeconomic
process, as highly plastic and conditionable animals, as congeries
of instinctive strivings ending in loss of sexual drive and death,
as cybernetic gadgets, or even as semantic conundrums. All of
these concepts have their supporters and they all have some degree
of truth m them. We may also be something more, &quot;a part of
the main,&quot; a striving sliver of a creative process, a manifestation
of Brahma in Atman, an aspect of an infinite God immanent and
transcendent within and without us. These very different valuings
of the self and of other people's selves have all been held sincerely
by men and women. I expect that even what seem the most extreme
notions are held by some contributors to these pages. Can one
doubt that the views of the world derived from such differing
concepts are likely to differ greatly, and that the courses of
action determined by those views will differ . . . ?

. . . I believe that the psychedelics provide a chance, perhaps
only a slender one, for homo faber, the cunning, ruthless, foolhardy,
pleasure-greedy toolmaker, to merge into that other creature whose
presence we have so rashly presumed, homo sapiens, the wise, the
understanding, the compassionate, in whose fourfold vision art,
politics, science, and religion are one. Surely we must seize
that chance....

And so it stands today. [1970]. We predict, to use the Iron Duke's
phrase to Creevey, that it will be &quot;a nice-run thing: the
nicest-run thing you ever saw....&quot;<P><HR WIDTH=50%>

(2) Today (July 1969) reports of chromosome changes are bewildering
to those not experts in this field. The various conflicting statements
suggest that the science of studying chromosomes requires an art
as great as that needed to interpret Rorschach inkblots. In that
famous and often valuable test, the non-expert must rely on his
own estimate of the reliability of the particular person who administered
and reported on the test. Great difficulties arise when men of
good repute publish findings that seem, at least to the naive,
to be diametrically opposed and irreconcilable. There is a danger
that, because of reports in the press based on earlier studies
that suggested unequivocal damage to chromosomes, some people
who were frightened away by this information will now decide that
there is no danger whatever. It may even be thought that this
was another trick like that deplorable episode in Pennsylvania,
where it was reported with considerable circumstantial detail
that a number of young men had gazed at the sun under the influence
of LSD-25 and were permanently blinded, suffering grave retinal
damage. This proved to be false. Thus are credibility crevasses
created. <A HREF="#back2">(Back)</A> <A NAME="footnote3"></A>
