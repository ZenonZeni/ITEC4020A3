<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Japan — Looking to reap $822 million in sales for <a href=http://www.calstart.org/intel/>Intel</a>ligent Transportation System (ITS) gear it is developing, NEC Corp. has built a new track in Japan for testing ITS technologies, reports Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The .4-mile course in Gotenba, Kanagawa Prefecture cost NEC $1.64 million to build and is part of its plan to invest $82.2 million over the next five years on research and development. Some projects will target electronic toll collection gear, others will develop automated highways that electronically control cars. The course – as part of the automated highway projects – is also set up to test sudden braking after low-friction tiles are spread on portions of the track.
