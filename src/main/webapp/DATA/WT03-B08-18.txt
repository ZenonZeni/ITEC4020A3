PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF A NEW MANAGEMENT PARADIGM

Over the past 20 years, a new management paradigm has
emerged that is the antithesis of mass production.
Firms employing this new paradigm rely on an integrated
set of principles and implementing practices.  First,
to get new products to market quickly they integrate
marketing, research and development, engineering,
design, production, and distribution.  Second, to
respond quickly to shifting demand they aim at
producing small lot sizes with minimal setup times -- a
practice known as lean production.  Third, to make
every aspect of production more visible they work with
fewer more qualified suppliers and involve them in
every phase of production, from product development on.
Finally, they delegate much greater operational
responsibility to those who design and manufacture the
product.

This (RAND Corp.) report uses an intensive survey of
the literature to describe and analyze this new
management paradigm.  By providing a framework for
understanding a very complicated subject, the report
serves as a resource for managers interested in those
practices that are shaping manufacturing and service
industries throughout the world.

DELAYERING THE MANAGEMENT HIERARCHY

Central to the new model of organization in the 1990s
is a flatter structure achieved by a reduction in the
number of layers of management hierarchy.  Despite
popular appeal, the fundamental claims made in the
literature remain largely unchallenged.  Like many
organizational design concepts, there is some confusion
as to what delayering means in practice, how such a
change should be implemented, and what support a
shorter management hierarchy requires.  This study from
England (Sussex University) examines the experience of
a sample of employing organizations who are or were in
the process of delayering their management structure.
Eight case study organizations were visited during the
course of the study.  The study uses the findings of
discussions to present an overall picture of the
issues.  Case study examples are used illustratively
throughout the report.

FUTURE CAREER MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN ORGANIZATIONS

This report from England (Sussex University) reviews
the career issues that organizations are currently
facing and provides a perspective on how organizations
can develop their career management strategies for the
future.  It covers many issues, such as: how careers
are changing as organizations change; and what the
pressures are on individuals and organizations as large
organizations restructure.

ORGANIZATIONAL REENGINEERING

This (GAO) document presents the results from a July
1994 symposium dealing with the reengineering of
organizations.  Five principles for effective
reengineering emerged from this GAO-sponsored
symposium.  While these principles are not intended to
be an all-inclusive list on how to effectively
implement reengineering, they form the basis of a
framework for bringing about the radical change
required to reengineer business processes in a large
organization: (1) top management must be supportive of,
and engaged in, reengineering efforts to remove
barriers and drive success; (2) an organization's
culture must be receptive to reengineering goals and
principles; (3) major improvements and savings are
realized by focusing on the business from a process
rather than a functional perspective; (4) processes
should be selected for reengineering based on a clear
notion of customer needs, anticipated benefits, and
potential for success; and (5) process owners should:
manage reengineering projects with teams that are
cross-functional, maintain a proper scope, focus on
customer metrics, and enforce implementation
timeliness.  Each of these principles is covered in
detail.

OVERHEAD COSTS ON GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

This (GAO) paper focuses on overhead costs.  Overhead
cost submissions are used to establish final overhead
rates that determine reimbursements under cost-type
contracts and to provide the historical cost basis for
overhead rates used to negotiate fixed-price contracts.
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) cost
principles require government contractors to identify
and exclude unallowable costs from overhead
submissions.  The report presents an illustrative
example of what is and is not allowable with respect to
Rocketdyne Corp., where about 80% of Rocketdyne's sales
are under government cost reimbursable-type contracts.

SCHEDULING OF JOBS THAT ARRIVE OVER TIME

A natural and basic problem in scheduling theory is to
provide good average-quality service to a stream of
jobs that arrive over time.  This (Sandia National
Laboratories) paper considers the problem of scheduling
jobs that are received over time, in order to minimize
the average completion time of the set of jobs.  The
paper presents the first constant-factor approximation
algorithms for several variants of a single and
parallel machine model.  Many of the algorithms are
based on interesting algorithmic and structural
relationships between preemptive and nonpreemptive
schedules and linear programming relaxations of both,
and many generalize to the minimization or average
weighted completion time as well.

SURVEY OF SOFTWARE METRICS

This (Institute for Defense Analysis) report presents a
survey of computer software measurement practices and
technology in commercial and DOD organizations.  The
report: (1) provides summaries of 11 DOD and 14
industry programs with respect to metrics goals,
metrics program implementation, and metrics sets; (2)
reports on tools and repositories; and (3) presents
best practices.  The study concludes that industry has
more mature and vigorous practices and technology than
DOD organizations, largely because industry is applying
metrics for clear market-driven reasons while DOD
acquisition lacks comparable motivations.  The report
develops recommendations to improve software
measurement and software measurement research goals.

THE ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF DECENTRALIZING
INFRASTRUCTURE

This (International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development) collection of papers disseminates some of
the lessons of the World Bank's experience and research
efforts on the linkages between decentralization and
infrastructure service delivery.  It shows that
decentralization is not a panacea, and unless some
demanding requirements are met, performance gains will
not materialize.  More specifically, the papers
provide: (1) a summary of the lessons from World Bank
experience on decentralization as a way of providing a
general context to the importance of infrastructure
decentralization; (2) a review of the more
institutional aspects and their implications for policy
design; (3) an empirical assessment of the consequences
of decentralization on expenditure levels and on
performance in infrastructure, and some indications of
the possible handles available to policymakers to
improve the odds of successful decentralization; and
(4) a research agenda on decentralization, relying more
systematically on recent developments involving the
theory of the firm.

STRATEGY FOR AFFORDABLE LEADING-EDGE DUAL-USE
TECHNOLOGY

This (DOD) report focuses on the use of dual-use
technology in defense-related private industries.
Rapid advances in commercial technology, combined with
declining budgets, have in many cases rendered
traditional approaches to technology development and
procurement less affordable and less effective than in
the past.  It is critical that organizations take
advantage of cost-conscious market-driven commercial
production, and that they leverage the huge investments
in leading-edge process technologies made by private
industry.  It is also important that technologies and
systems keep pace with the rapid product development
cycles.  Dual use technology policies are a key
component of investment strategies for maintaining
performance superiority and affordability in this new
technological and economic defense-industry
environment.  Elements of the dual-use technology
investment strategy serve to: (1) ensure that key
elements of the technology-base that are critical for
national security remain at the leading edge; (2)
support the transitioning of defense-sponsored
technology and the integration of military production
with the commercial base; and (3) facilitate insertion
of commercial technologies into military systems.

principal foreign source of defense material and
technology, with annual purchases averaging
approximately $1 billion during the 1980s.  This figure
could reach $2 billion if current agreements are
executed.  While Japan's defense procurement policies
are less explicit and organized than those of the U.S.,
they have generally favored U.S. industry over other
foreign competitors.  The decline of the Soviet threat,
combined with a rise in U.S.-Japanese trade friction,
could result in a diminution of U.S. industry access to
Japan's defense market.  There is a perception that
Japan has exploited U.S. defense technologies to build
competitive civilian industries, while enjoying U.S.
military protection.  Despite these problems, the study
concludes that U.S. industry's participation in Japan's
defense market is in DOD's interest and worth
continuing.  Pressuring the Japanese to accept a
reciprocal defense procurement agreement, or to adopt
DOD-style procurement practices, could be
counterproductive.

DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IN THE JAPANESE
PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY

This (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report
deals with the development of the Japanese
petrochemical industry from the 1950s through the
1960s, solely from the standpoint of the process of
technology transfer.  The technology transfer of the
Japanese petrochemical industry in this period is
interesting, because: (1) it was an industry at the
core of the heavy and chemical industries, which were
an important pillar of Japan's industrial policy; (2)
it was a new technical field with no past history; and
(3) unraveling of technology was successfully pursued,
with the result that Japan became a petrochemical
technology exporting country in the 1960s.

TRENDS AND MEASURES TO PROMOTE DIRECT FOREIGN
INVESTMENT IN JAPAN

This translation from Japan (from MITI) addresses
trends in foreign direct investment in Japan, including
several measures taken by the Japanese government to
promote such investment.  These measures include: the
establishment of the Japan Investment Council; the
relaxing of investment regulations; supporting the
enactment of laws and tax schemes; providing supports
for foreign investments in the Japan Development
Corporation; providing low-interest loans to foreign
affiliates; and having JETRO (Japan External Trade
Organization -- an arm of MITI) become active in
promoting foreign direct investments in Japan.

GLOBALIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE
INTERNATIONALIZATION OF R&D

This (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report
deals with the globalization of technology and the
internationalization of R&D.  Technology globalization
is being driven by four kinds of factors: (1) those
directly concerned with science and technology; (2)
market factors; (3) regulatory and government-related
factors; and (4) competitive factors.  The latter two
operate primarily at the level of the firm; the first
two affect the growing interdependence of national
systems  directly, as well as through the
border-spanning activities of firms that can take three
forms: (1) international technology scanning and
acquisition; (2) strategic alliances with foreign
partners; and (3) setting up R&D facilities abroad.
The paper surveys the major drivers of the
globalization of technology and the organizational
issues involved in the three modes of extending a
firm's technology reach beyond its home country, with
particular focus on Western firms' penetration of
foreign markets.

THE ROLE OF CONSORTIA IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

Technology consortia are technology alliances among
business firms, universities, and governments.  They
are formed to share the increasingly rising costs and
risks associated with undertaking basic or
precompetitive research and development (R&D).  This
study from Canada (by Industry Canada) analyzes the
role of R&D consortia in technology development.  The
study focuses on the growth of technology consortia in
the U.S., the participation of Canadian companies in
those consortia, and the institutional barriers to
Canadian membership in American R&D consortia.

STUDY OF R&D CONSORTIA IN JAPAN'S SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND
ENGINEERING CERAMICS INDUSTRY

For the past three decades, R&D consortia have been an
extensively used tool of industrial science and
technology policy in Japan; however, detailed analysis
of Japan's R&D consortia is still very limited, with
most discussions focusing on one project: the VLSI
(very large-scale integrated) circuits project of the
late 1970s.  This (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology) dissertation adds to our understanding of
cooperative R&D by examining the performance and impact
of several R&D consortia in the areas of
superconductivity and engineering ceramics.  The text
addresses: (1) project formation; (2) the nature of
technological advance; (3) organization for
collaboration; (4) the impact of consortia programs on
the technology and the industry; and (5) the existence
of general norms of collaboration.

STRENGTHENING THE U.S. MICROELECTRONICS INDUSTRY
THROUGH FEDERAL CONSORTIA POLICY

This (Sandia National Laboratories) report deals with
the use of federal technology policy to strengthen the
U.S. microelectronics industry.  A review of U.S. and
Japanese experiences with using microelectronics
consortia as a tool for strengthening their respective
industries reveals major differences.  Japan has
established catch-up consortia with focused goals.
These consortia have a finite life targeted from the
beginning, and emphasis is on work that supports or
leads to product and process-improvement-driven
commercialization.  Japan's government has played a key
role in facilitating the development of consortia and
has used consortia to promote domestic competition.

U.S. consortia, on the other hand, have often
emphasized long-range research with considerably less
focus than those in Japan.  The U.S. consortia have
searched for, and often made, revolutionary technology
advancements; however, technology transfer to their
members has been difficult.  Only SEMATECH has assisted
its members with continuous improvements involving:
compressed product cycles; established relationships;
and strengthened core competencies.  The U.S.
government has not been a catalyst, nor has it provided
leadership, in consortia creation and operation.

The study proposes that, in order to regain world
leadership in areas where U.S. companies lag foreign
competition, the U.S. should create industry-wide,
horizontal-vertical, catch-up consortia, or continue
existing consortia in the six areas where the U.S. lags
behind Japan: optoelectronics; displays; memories;
materials; packaging; and manufacturing equipment.  It
also recommends that consortia be established for
special government microelectronics and for
microelectronics research integration and application;
that these consortia be managed by an industry-led
Microelectronics Alliance whose establishment would be
coordinated by the Department of Commerce; and that the
Semiconductor Research Corporation, the National
Science Foundation Engineering Research Centers, and
relevant elements of other federal programs be
integrated into this consortia complex.

THE BENEFITS OF GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY COOPERATIVE R&D
AGREEMENTS (CRADAs)

This (GAO) report to Congress deals with cooperative
R&D agreements and the transfer of technology between
federal laboratories and industry, which is
increasingly viewed as a significant factor in the
economic growth and well-being of the U.S.  Cooperative
R&D Agreements (CRADAs) are one of several mechanisms
whereby federal laboratories and private industry
collaborate on R&D.  CRADAs define the terms and
conditions of the collaboration.  The report reviews
the role of CRADAs in successfully transferring
technology to the private sector, and develops and
presents a series of case studies that highlight the
benefits of engaging in such collaborations at the
Departments of Agriculture, Army, Commerce, and Health
and Human Services.  While all CRADAs may not achieve
the same level of benefits, both the federal agencies
and private companies that are reviewed in the report
have benefited from these collaborations.

THE EFFECTS OF SMALL BUSINESS LENDING ON BANK PROFITS
AND RISK

Drawing on data from the `call reports' that banks file
with federal regulators, this (Texas A&M University)
study compares the profitability of more active small
business lenders to that of less active banks.  The
analysis shows that, on average, banks earn higher
profit rates on small business loans than on other
assets.  These higher-than-average rates of return are
earned by increasing the bank's risk, including capital
risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and funding risk.
Importantly, multiple regression analyses indicate that
small business loans do not affect bank profit after
adjusting for these and other risk factors.

STUDY OF THE INCIDENCE, IMPACTS, IMPLICATIONS, AND
STRATEGIES OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING

This (University of Rhode Island) study examines a
set of hypotheses regarding flexible manufacturing:
(1) manufacturing firms are increasingly relying on
flexible strategies; (2) manufacturing flexibility
coincides with vertical disintegration and
specialization in core areas of expertise; (3) flexible
manufacturing firms gain competitive advantage through
economies of scope rather than scale; (4) these firms
achieve such economies via networks of collaborative
firms; (5) such firms and their networks tend to
agglomerate geographically; and (6) such firms'
flexibility requires a broadly-skilled labor force.
The study uses national data on changes in industrial
flexibility, vertical disintegration, and
agglomeration, to rank manufacturing industries by
their apparent degree of flexibility and vertical
disintegration.  Using this ranking, three top
industries are selected based on their heavy presence
in New England and their dissimilarity: aircraft
equipment; medical instruments; and textile finishing.
The bulk of the report focuses on these three
industries.  The findings indicate diverse strategies
and patterns of inter-firm relations in the three
industries.

COMPUTER USE VERSUS FIRM SIZE

This (Popkin and Co.) paper provides new evidence on
the use of information-processing technologies by firm
size.  It does so by detailing the extent to which
computers are used by workers in firms of different
sizes.  The paper also provides estimates of the
returns by firm size to employees using computers on
their job.  Computer use leads to productivity gains
which benefit both employees that use them and firms
that invest in them.  Determining the size of those
gains by firm size is important for an understanding of
the competitive outlook for small firms in the emerging
information-based economy, and for related policy
purposes.
