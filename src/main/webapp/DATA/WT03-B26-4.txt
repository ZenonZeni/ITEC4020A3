<H4>1. ABOUT THE CSIRO EOC</H4>
<BR>
AVHRR has provided the world community with global data and a dense time
series of earth observation now for at least 15 years. However, it is only
relatively recently that the data have moved out of the research area to
be evaluated in the 'workplace' of end user needs. This has come about in
Australia from the development of operational receiving stations and programs
of archiving and processing the data received over the continent and EEZ.<BR>
<BR>
CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications (COSSA) and Agencies such
as the Bureau of Meteorology have played a significant role in this development
and today the availability of daily near real time and archival time series
of data for the Australian region is unprecedented. Nevertheless, the development
of this capability has not been without its problems. Many of these were
described in a review carried out on behalf of COSSA of its Data Acquisition
and Utilisation multi-Divisional Program MDP-19 . In this report (often
referred to as the Simpson Report from its principal author) many of the
issues of fragmentation and dispersion of effort were outlined and remedies
suggested.<BR>
<BR>
One of the outcomes of the Simpson Report has been the formation of the
Earth Observation Centre (EOC) which is developing to provide a focus and
identity for CSIRO Earth Observation Research and Development as well as
act to coordinate some of the activities that were identified in the Simpson
Report as limiting to the full value being obtained from CSIRO activities.
In the area of Land AVHRR use there is considerable focus and activity among
CSIRO scientists who either as part of the formative EOC or from the Divisions
with which it is working closely will outline their work to you this morning.
They are among scientists who have been and will in the future engage in
cross-Divisional projects in the fields of: 
<UL>
<LI>Data Management [<I>with data providers and distributors</I>] 
<LI>Advanced Information Processing 
<LI>Calibration and Validation 
<LI>Advanced Measurement Models Based Products 
<LI>Applications Support [<I>with Divisions and Industry</I>] 
</UL>
The knowledge base for the projects largely rests in the Divisions and the
work will be aimed to support the Divisional needs in data and the Divisional
interface with clients and users in the Sectors which the Divisions address.
However, we see an underlying generic set of activities which are bigger
in scope than can be handled by any one Division and which underpin the
eventual acceptance and usefulness of the products to the real end users
- people who want information about the world and the way it is changing.<BR>
<BR>
The EOC is an initiative that has been developing for some time and is now
fully and rapidly moving to address generic issues in the areas outlined
above. It aims to maximise the benefit obtained from the activities of the
excellent earth observation scientists in CSIRO and see it impact effectively
on the development of the industries that can put the information to work.
In order to do this fully, however, I believe we must all (researchers,
producers and users together) consider the issue of data and product standards.<BR>
