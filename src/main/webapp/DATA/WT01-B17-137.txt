<P>




	By the time Howard came to the Hospital of the Americas he had tried everything conventional medicine could offer to reverse his prostate cancer. The cancer had spread to his bone marrow and his conventional doctors had sent him home to die. At 82, Howard looked like “walking death,” his doctors admitted. He was excessively thin and his PSA (prostate specific antigen, a reliable indicator) was over 20, compared to a healthy normal of 0-4. The Hospital, administered by the World Center for Anti-Aging Medicine and set in a pristine, pollution-free coastal corner of the Dominican Republic, was his last hope.<p>
	The Hospital’s team of doctors, led by founder Dr. James Monroe Parsons, M.D., started Howard on their multifaceted treatment program. They gave him shark cartilage (3 injections of 8 cc per week) and live cell thymus gland injections (8 cc once a week). Dr. Parsons’ team also gave Howard a Chinese herbal detoxifying formula once daily (containing Fumaria officinalis, Fasera carolinensis, allicin, and garlic, among other ingredients); colonic irrigation once daily; and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for one hour, 6 days a week.<p>
	In only the second week of this regimen, Howard began to notice an improvement. His energy picked up and he started to gain weight. After 12 weeks, he had no complaints, he had gained 12 pounds and no longer had that deathlike appearance. His PSA level dropped to within normal range. Three months later, not only was he still alive, but Howard was enjoying a “quality” life, says Dr. Parsons. <p><br>

	<b>THE FREEDOM TO HEAL.</b> The Hospital offers a roster of progressive alternative therapies for the prevention and treatment of disease. The “anti-aging” in their name highlights the fact that as most diseases accelerate the aging process, good medicine will act to slow down the aging process.<p>
	The facility, which opened in mid-1995, has an arrangement with 12 nearby hotels to provide lodging for patients. The cost of all treatments and a hotel room runs about $3000 per week (compared to $5000 per week for many off-shore treatment facilities). Total laboratory work typically costs a patient $500-$700.<p> 
	Dr. Parsons, who has been in practice for 30 years, founded the Hospital out of his frustration at not being able to offer effective treatments to his patients while in the U.S. It also represented his effort to bring to practical fruition an insight he had developed during his many years of practice: that our highly technologized civilization spews out so many toxins that surely this is a major cause of the incredible proliferation of disease over the last 50 years. “As a doctor, I have always felt this to be the truth and yet saw it was almost universally ignored,” Dr. Parsons explains.<p>
	The Hospital of the Americas provides an array of treatments, some of them unavailable in the U.S. despite ample evidence of positive results. “Americans are starving, if not dying, for access to these treatments,” says Dr. Parsons, who is the Hospital’s chief medical consultant and an active member of the International Board of Medical Toxicologists.<p>
	“You cannot practice medicine in the United States of America, period, end of statement,” he declares. “If a doctor sees or reads about a new, cutting-edge treatment that is effective, and uses it in the U.S., he could lose his license. The American Medical Association, FDA, and the state medical licensing boards put doctors into a kind of therapeutic gridlock, so they all march to the same conventional drummer and treat in the same way. If you do anything different, you’re said to not be practicing up to the accepted level of your colleagues. I had to get offshore in order to do more to help patients heal.<p>
	Parsons’ clinic has achieved success in treating a range of serious health conditions, including cancer, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, circulatory disorders, diabetes, fungal infestation, chronic fatigue, Parkinson’s, and lupus. The key is to identify and then remove toxins from the body. In fact, 95% of all degenerative diseases, including cancer, are probably caused by chemicals and polluting substances, says Hildegarde L. A. Staninger, Ph.D., a prominent toxicologist with Sunstate Preventive Medicine Institute in Winter Park, Florida, who joined with Dr. Parsons to establish the Hospital. <p><br>

	<b>KNOW YOUR PATIENT’S TOXINS.</b> Detoxification is a main component of the clinic’s program, but first you must identify the toxins, Dr. Staninger explains. Hospital toxicity tests screen up to 100,000 different substances, even at the minutest levels of parts per quadrillion. Dr. Parsons’ staff routinely tests blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and hair as needed; hair analysis is the best way to detect heavy metals, says Dr. Parsons.<p>
 	To test for the damage level of toxin activity, the Hospital uses the Maverick Monitoring Test (MMT), an innovative protocol developed by Dr. Staninger. Maverick measures body levels of toxic agents that create harmful free radicals; these measures provide scientifically based indications for treatment.<p>
	For example, Sarah, aged 11, was exposed to Ficam W, a pesticide normally used on cracks and crevices to kill molds. But at her school, the maintenance department irresponsibly sprayed it on the classroom rugs. Sarah had only a 15-minute exposure, but she developed pain in her liver and extreme fatigue. Within 12 hours, she was rushed to the clinic for treatment. Toxicity tests indicated pesticide solvents in her system and her liver enzymes were highly elevated, at 271 compared to 105, which is normal for a child her age.<p>
	Sarah’s immune system was becoming severely compromised. A blood test revealed elevated Epstein-Barr virus levels, at 429 titer compared to a normal of less than 100. Dr. Parsons immediately put her on hyperbaric oxygen therapy for one hour a day for 5 days to flush the poisons out of her system. He also put her on vitamin E (400 I.U. daily) and a roster of specially formulated products including Vira Defense (1 capsule twice daily), Super Defense Plus (1 capsule, 3 times daily), Hepta Defense (1 capsule once daily), and Alpha Defense (1 capsule, twice daily).<p>
	When Sarah was tested again after 5 days, she was negative for the toxic chemicals and her Epstein-Barr had dropped to a safer 78 titer. She no longer felt fatigued and her liver pain was gone. To complete her detoxification, drop the EBV even lower, and bolster her immune system, Dr. Parsons gave Sarah 5 more hyperbaric treatments, spaced a day apart, and continued her on the supplements for another 8 weeks.<p>

	<b>MANY WAYS TO DETOXIFY.</b> As Sarah’s case shows, with the toxins identified, detoxification can proceed on a more precisely targeted and individually tailored basis, Dr. Staninger says. No two people are ever sick in the same way, even when they apparently have the same disease or have been poisoned by the same chemicals. A customized approach to detoxification and healing is essential, Dr. Staninger notes.<p>
	The Hospital has multiple modalities at its disposal to detoxify its patients. These include: biological dentistry (removing mercury, gold, and nickel amalgams); colon cleansing and irrigation; oxygen therapy (including inhalation of mist and ionized oxygen); herbal soaks or poultices; parasitic disease control; homeopathic remedies; Chinese herbs; and medically supervised diets and fasts.<p>
	Dr. Parsons’ staff may also employ electroacupuncture (EAV, a form of electro-dermal screening) for both diagnosis and detoxification; a resonant frequency microcurrent treatment; color laser therapy; live cell therapy (to rejuvenate organs and the endocrine system); chelation therapy (to flush toxins out of the bloodstream); lymphatic drainage and recirculation; and colloidal mineral water, among others.<p>
	The clinic’s multimodal approach also comprises psychotherapy, meditation, stress reduction techniques, hatha yoga, and exercise instruction. There are of course specific dietary programs for every patient, but in general Dr. Parsons’ advice is to avoid “Fat White CATS” by which he means fats, white flour, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and sugar.<p>
	All of these approaches, both on their own and when applied in concert, pull out disease-producing toxins from the body which exerts a positive effect on mental function, states Dr. Parsons. Ionized oxygen breathing helps to rehabilitate tissues and cells, reduce free radical damage, and improve circulation. Breathing specially prepared mists helps to oxygenate and detoxify the tiny air passages in the lungs, thereby removing debris. This is especially effective for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Herbal soaks (a Chinese herbal formula combined with DMSO, made into a poultice) pull toxins out through the skin.<p>
	 There’s something to be said for the positive influence of the clinic’s environment, too. For many, the Playa Dorada (“Golden Beach”) area of the Dominican Republic is a “Caribbean Eden.” The Hospital is set in the midst of a considerable vacation resort development that offers 3692 hotel rooms, 35 restaurants, 3 casinos, and a golf course.<p>

	<b>MORE OXYGEN, LESS AGING.</b> Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is one of the most thoroughly detoxifying methods Dr. Parsons employs. “Oxygen can burn up toxic substances in the body in a short time,” he states. Dr. Parsons uses the monoplace chamber (a chamber for one person) because it achieves a thorough oxygenation by driving 100% oxygen through the skin.<p>
	HBOT corrects the inadequate oxygen levels in the blood of elderly patients. In fact, Dr. Parsons contends that many of the diseases associated with aging are actually the product of severely and progressively decreased blood and tissue oxygenation. That’s why so many age-related degenerative conditions respond well to oxygen therapy.<p>
	A now famous statement from Science (February 24, 1956, Vol. 123, No. 3191, “On the Origin of Cancer Cells”) reminds us that Otto Warburg, M.D., the only doctor to win two Nobel prizes for medicine, won them because of oxygen. He proved that cancer develops when the oxygen requirement of cells is reduced to 40% and that when cellular respiration is damaged from lack of oxygen, this provokes cells to mutate out of control into cancer cells. Oxygen therapy would therefore be an effective treatment for many diseases, said Dr. Warburg.<p>
	Dr. Parsons agrees. “Older people, receiving more oxygen, regain the circulation of their blood and sometimes add years to their life span,” says Dr. Parsons. And these are “good years, worth living,” not just mere life extension. <p>

	<b>A SPA FOR THE HEALTHY TOURIST.</b> It is not only the chronically or desperately ill who come to the Hospital. The facility offers techniques for rejuvenating the skin, removing wrinkles and blemishes, and achieving weight loss as well as body recontouring which is an alternative to plastic surgery. Lymphatic work, also offered, breaks up and flushes toxic collections of lymph fluid that may be contributing to unsightly skin.<p>
	Often tourists from nearby resorts drop by for a toxicity test and detoxification regimen as a wise preventive measure, says Dr. Parsons. From blood and urine samples, Dr. Parsons’ team can provide them with a complete report in a few days, telling them if their body harbors anything that is potentially illness-producing or age-accelerating. <p>
	An ounce of smart prevention can so often be worth years of cure, quips Dr. Parsons. “I believe our multimodal approach to testing, detoxification, and nutritional support will be the standard medicine of the next century and will be ever more in demand as the years pass. Our medical care for the new millennium is ready now, to be used to achieve wellness.<p>
