BNI president upbeat about share offering

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The president of state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia
(BNI) 1946, Widigdo Sukarman, said yesterday he was confident the bank's
initial public offering (IPO) in November would be well received by
investors despite the large number of shares it had to sell.
   Widigdo said the bank, which started a "roadshow" promotion campaign
here yesterday, would take the IPO roadshow to six other cities in
Indonesia and to major financial centers in Japan, Europe and the United
States to attract investors.
   "We are confident that foreign and domestic investors will respond
positively. The potential demand for BNI shares is quite good," he told
reporters after launching the bank's roadshow program, which is to end
on Oct. 24.
   He said the bank, the country's largest commercial bank, would sell
1.08 billion new shares, or around 25 percent of its enlarged capital.
   The share prices, each with a face value of Rp 500 (20 U.S. cents),
are to be determined at the end of the roadshow. The shares are to be
sold to the public during the primary offering period between Nov. 6 and
Nov. 29.
   Widigdo hinted that the price of the bank's shares would be set at a
reasonable level even though the potential demand for the shares was
promising.
   "The bank's IPO is merely based on business factors so that we will
make a success not only on the primary market but also on the secondary
market," he said in an indirect reference to the decline of a number of
listed companies' share prices to below their IPO prices.
   He said the proceeds from the IPO would be used to boost its capital
and strengthen its short-term and long-term finance.

Assets

   BNI's total assets were valued at Rp 32.35 trillion ($13.7 billion)
on June 30 this year, with deposits amounting to Rp 17.90 trillion and
loans to Rp 20.44 trillion.
   Its pretax profit totaled Rp 198.6 billion in the first semester of
this year, or more than half of last year's pretax profit of Rp 378.7
billion.
   David Chang, the research division director of securities company PT
Vickers Ballas Tamara, said the bank, which had the widest national
network, with over 489 branches throughout the country and six overseas
branches, was projected to sell its shares at a price which offered a
price earning ratio between eight and 10 times of its 1997 profit. On
the Jakarta Stock Exchange, the banking sector's price earning ratio is
generally eight times its 1997 profits.
   "If the bank offered (the shares) at a discount, the issue is likely
to be successful because it deserves a premium over the banking sector,
given its sovereignty," he told The Jakarta Post.
   The bank is expected to raise around Rp 1 trillion from the IPO,
allowing it to strengthen its capital and improve its capital adequacy
ratio from its current level of 9.1 percent to about 12 percent, he
said.
   Chang said the bank, which is expected to maintain its loan to
deposit ratio at around 85 percent to 90 percent, would generate
sufficient funds from the IPO to support its growth over the next three
to four years.
   He projected that BNI would maintain its credit expansion rate at
about 17 percent a year for the next few years in conformity with the
central bank's low loan expansion target.
   BNI's net interest margin is likely to remain at 3.5 percent in 1997
as it compensates for the rise in its reserve requirement from 3 percent
to 5 percent next April, he said.
   On funding, Chang said the bank had an advantage over its competitors
in strengthening its retail market, given its large branch network and
its low sovereign risk. (hen)

Sukarno's daughters make peace with army officer

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): A lawsuit for libel which was filed by two of former
president Sukarno's daughters against Armed Forces' Chief of
Sociopolitical Affairs Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid was settled by mediation
in court yesterday.
   The conflicting parties agreed to end the row after Syarwan
"corrected" a contentious statement that he reportedly made on Megawati
Soekarnoputri, the deposed chairperson of the Indonesian Democratic
Party (PDI), and Sukmawati Soekarnoputri last August.
   The agreement was mediated by Judge Thoyib at the East Jakarta
District Court.
   Megawati and Sukmawati filed the lawsuit, saying they were offended
by Syarwan's statement, published by Surya daily newspaper, which
accused Megawati of planning to start a rebellion along the lines of
Cory Aquino's "people's power" in the Philippines.
   In the Surya article, Syarwan was reported as saying that Sukmawati
was mobilizing her Marhaen group, a pronationalist organization of
followers of Sukarno's teachings, to help the rebellion.
   Syarwan's remarks were reportedly made during a meeting with members
of the Indonesian Ulema Council in Jakarta on Aug. 12. Surya's front
page article the following day carried the suggestive heading "Megawati
wants to become Cory Aquino: ABRI Chief of Sociopolitical Affairs".
   Megawati and Sukmawati said the remarks were slanderous and damaging
to the reputation of their father and people in general. They demanded a
public apology and Rp 50 billion in damages.
   Only Sukmawati was present in court yesterday. Syarwan and Megawati
were represented by their lawyers.
   Syarwan's lawyers Col. Imron Anwari and Major Payaman Pangaribuan
told the court that the statements regarding the two plaintiffs, printed
in Surya, "were untrue".
   This correction was deemed sufficient by the plaintiffs who
considered the case to be over, Antara reported.
   R.O. Tambunan, who represented Megawati at the hearing, told The
Jakarta Post last night that his client was not insisting on a public
apology.
   "The hearing today was open to the public and it was widely covered
by local and international press," Tambunan said, adding that the
decision "reflected Megawati's big heart".
   The case for Rp 50 billion in damages was automatically dropped.
   "We weren't after the money when we filed the lawsuit. We only wanted
to see the names of Megawati and Sukmawati restored," he said.
   He said the peace agreement resulted from a meeting of the parties'
lawyers on Sept. 17.
   "We did not drop the lawsuit. We came to an agreement," he stressed.
   Tambunan said that another lawsuit, filed by Megawati against the
Armed Forces Chief, the National Police Chief, the Minister of Home
Affairs and her foes in the PDI, would proceed.
   In this lawsuit, Megawati is demanding that the results of the
congress of her PDI foes in Medan in June be annulled. The congress,
which had the backing of the government and the military, deposed her as
the party's leader.
   This lawsuit is scheduled for this Thursday at the Central Jakarta
District Court. Efforts for an out of court settlement have failed.
   Syarwan's remarks in August came in the wake of massive riots in
Jakarta in which at least four people died.
   The July 27 riots, blamed on the leftist Democratic People's Party,
began after the violent takeover of the PDI headquarters by supporters
of Soerjadi, who ousted Megawati as the party's leader. (emb/imn)

ABRI reshuffles another hundred senior officers

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The Armed Forces (ABRI) announced yesterday a reshuffle
affecting more than 100 senior officers in all four services, including
the reassignment of onetime rising star Maj. Gen. A.M. Hendropriyono.
   ABRI Chief Spokesman Brig. Gen. Amir Syarifudin told Antara that
Hendro would be recalled to ABRI headquarters, pending a new assignment
in a civilian position.
   Amir did not elaborate, but Suara Pembaruan daily reported yesterday
that Hendro, currently chief of the Army Training School in Bandung,
will be given the post of secretary for development operations, a
strategic position under the supervision of the State Secretariat.
   Some military analysts said the new civilian post would end his
military career. Hendro is currently 51 years old; the mandatory
retirement age for military officers is 55 years.
   A 1967 graduate of the Military Academy, Hendro was once regarded as
one of the Army's most promising rising stars when he became the
youngest ever chief of a regional military command. He became chief of
the Jakarta Regional Military Command at the age of 48 in 1993.

Latest reshuffle

   Amir said the latest reshuffle in the military affects 108 senior
officers. As stipulated in a Sept. 16 decree by ABRI Chief Gen. Feisal
Tanjung, 52 Army officers, 24 Navy officers, 13 Air Force officers, and
19 officers of the National Police are being moved.
   Another major important change, announced Saturday, was the
replacement of the current assistant to the chief of sociopolitical
affairs, Maj. Gen. Suwarno Adiwijoyo, who is nearing the mandatory
retirement age of 55.
   He will be replaced by his deputy, Brig. Gen. Budi Harsono, who will
become the new assistant to Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid. Suwarno will be
recalled to the armed forces headquarters before he retires.
   The commandant of the Bandung-based Infantry Weapons Center, Maj.
Gen. Rachmad Mokoginta, is also being moved as he too is preparing for
his retirement. He will be replaced by his deputy Brig. Gen. Luhut
Panjaitan.
   Changes in the Navy include the reassignment of  Maj. Gen. (Marine)
Gafur Chalik, currently aide to the ABRI chief, to the Navy headquarters
to prepare for his retirement.
   Commodore Freddy Numberi, currently aide to the navy Chief of Staff,
will be assigned as Chief of the Fifth Sea Born Command based in Irian
Jaya, and Brig. Gen. (Marine) Benyamin Balukh, will be assigned as
deputy chief of the Armed Forces School of Command.
   In the Air Force, Rear Marshall Sadeli Kalman, chief of the Air
Force's Maintenance Division will be replaced by Commodore Syaiful
Kartimunaf.
   In the National Police, Brig. Gen. Soerpadi will be assigned as the
new director for operational education at the National Resilience
Institute, replacing Brig. Gen. I Wayan Karya. (imn)

Minister confirms art theft

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The government confirmed yesterday the theft of a
number of valuable Indonesian paintings from the National Museum,
including two masterpieces withdrawn Friday by international auction
house Christie's from its October sale in Singapore.
   The theft took place a month ago and was believed to involve members
of staff at the museum, according to Minister of Education and Culture
Wardiman Djojonegoro.
   He said: "The stolen paintings have been withdrawn by Christie's from
its auction house."
   It was the first official statement issued by the government since
the news of the theft, categorized as part of the national collection,
was broken by some local media late last week.
   Wardiman gave no details about the other titles or the precise number
of paintings stolen from the museum, which is under the supervision of
the minister's office.
   According to reliable sources, at least six paintings by world-
renowned Indonesian masters, such as Raden Sarief Bustaman Saleh,
better-known as Raden Saleh, Affandi and Raden Basoeki Abdullah have
been taken.
   Police records show that the theft was only reported by museum
staffer Kolam Sardjono on Sept. 12.
   However, the theft was hidden from the public by the museum until art
curators were amazed to see Christie's catalog for the Oct. 6 auction
feature two paintings by Indonesian masters previously thought to be in
the National Museum here.
   Local media first reported the theft Friday, despite no official
comment from the authorities.
   Shortly after a long meeting the same day, Christie's International
Singapore Pte. Ltd. announced that the two paintings, A Nude, completed
in 1992, by Basoeki Abdullah and Portrait of a Dutch Governor Wearing
the Willems Order, completed in 1867, by Raden Saleh, were withdrawn
from its upcoming auction.
   However, there is no further explanation about the hasty withdrawal
or the current whereabouts of the paintings.
   Minister Wardiman criticized the media for disturbing the
investigation to arrest the thieves.
   "The reports have made the investigation more difficult. That's why I
asked the press not to magnify the case," he said.
   The minister said that any dishonest museum employees might have had
a double motivation; the poor security system and their low pay.
   "The museum employees are state employees. Therefore, they have the
same level of salary earned by other state employees," said Wardiman.
   Consequently the temptation to steal the precious items could have
become stronger, he said.
   The salary of middle-rank state employees ranges from Rp 250,000 to
Rp 500,000 (US$106 to $212) per month. The price of the each painting is
hundreds of millions of rupiah.
   The National Museum, located on Jl. Medan Merdeka Barat in Central
Jakarta, has recorded a number of thefts of a wide range of national
treasure from its collection.
   National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Dibyo Widodo said Sunday in Batam
Island, Riau, that the police have questioned a number of people
regarding the recent theft of the paintings.
   The three-star general also said that the Indonesian police have
asked the local police in Singapore, through Interpol, to help
investigate the stolen paintings.
   In another related development yesterday, Minister of Tourism, Post
and Telecommunication Joop Ave called on Christie's to cooperate with
Indonesia to arrest the suspects. (bsr/icn)

IKIP Surabaya selects new rector

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURABAYA: The state Teachers Training Institute (IKIP) in Surabaya,
is having trouble selecting a new rector to replace Soerono
Martorahardjo.
   The three best of ten nominees for the position are said to have
flaws. Although two of them have doctorate degrees, one is said to have
been involved in corruption involving a campus development project three
years ago and one has been the target of student protests over the
expulsion of a lecturer.
   The other candidate has good leadership and academic ability but only
has an undergraduate degree (S1), said lecturers at the institute
yesterday.
   Academics at the institute doubt that he would be respected
professionally, because of his lack of experience and scientific
background.
   Suripan Sadi Hutomo, one of the three best candidates, said that the
nominees were selected on Sept. 17.
   "But the results have not been announced yet. Not even internally,"
he said.
   The institute is preparing to become a university in about three
years, when is expected to have the biggest campus in Southeast Asia.

238 arrested for timber theft

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURABAYA: A forest raid, code-named "Brush Operation", has resulted
in the arrest of 238 people in Jombang and Nganjuk who are suspected of
stealing 600 cubic meters of teakwood from surrounding forests.
   "We expect that court hearings will be held soon to try all the
suspects, some of which are members of the Armed Forces (ABRI),"
Marsanto, a provincial government official in charge of security,
agrarian and public affairs, said yesterday.
   According to Antara, the market price of illegal timber ranges
between Rp 200,000 (US$85) and Rp 300,000 a meter cubic.
   He said 850 mobile brigade officers took part in the raid in areas
prone to illegal teak wood logging, including Nganjuk, Jombang and
Madiun.
   Marsanto said the operation would be extended to cover other areas in
East Java such as Bojonegoro and Padangan.
   "More preventive measures will be taken to deter teakwood theft," he
said.
   Nganjuk regent Soetrisno said that while he supported the efforts to
eliminate teakwood theft, he criticized a recent police move to
confiscate a local official's chair which they suspected of being made
from stolen wood. (14)

Reporters demand proper probe

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURAKARTA, Central Java: The Yogyakarta chapter of the Indonesian
Journalists Association is considering whether to ask the National
Commission on Human Rights to investigate the death of a local reporter
here last month.
   The chairman of the association's Yogyakarta chapter, Oka
Kusumayudha, said yesterday that he would refer the case to the rights
commission if the police investigation into the murder was
unsatisfactory.
   Senior journalists have formed a fact-finding team to assist the
police. The team has submitted five bundles of reports to the
journalists association in Jakarta, Oka said.
   Fuad Muhammad Safrudin was fatally beaten in his home on Aug. 13. He
did not regain consciousness before he died in intensive care three days
later. The Bernas journalist is survived by his wife and two children.
   "If the police neglect to follow up our team's findings, we will seek
help from the National Commission on Human Rights," Oka said.
   According to Oka, the association had encouraged the police to speed
up their investigation.
   "The team works relentlessly, meticulously and professionally, after
all, they are used to searching for facts," Oka said.
   Oka added that the Chief of the Yogyakarta Police Precinct Col.
Darsono had promised a thorough and proper investigation. (har/14)

'Clear conscience inspired Frans Seda'

   JAKARTA (JP): A clear conscience consistently underlined the thoughts
and actions of senior economist Frans Seda, one of the architects of the
New Order, says book editor Frans M. Parera.
   "In answering social, political and economic challenges, Frans Seda
has consistently acted with a clear conscience," Frans Parera told
reporters yesterday.
   Frans Parera headed the team which edited a soon-to-be-released book
in honor of Frans Seda's 70th birthday. The book Kekuasaan dan Moral
(Power and Morality) is to be launched on Oct. 6.
   In connection with his birthday, a seminar will be held on Sept. 26
to review the political economy of Indonesia during the 1966 to 1970
period, Frans Parera was reported by Antara as saying. The seminar is to
be held at the Catholic Atmajaya University in Jakarta.
   Frans Parera described Frans Seda as a "three-generation statesman"
and a "professional politician" because of his lengthy experience and
his rational way of examining the state administration.
   He kept his distance from religious and ethnic organizations for the
sake of establishing a united, harmonious nation, Frans Parera said.
   "In his thoughts and writing, Frans Seda constantly tries to define
power amid changes with time," he said.
   Frans Seda has always been critical of inconsistencies in the state
administration, he added.
   Frans Seda was born in Maumere, Flores, on Oct. 4, 1926.
   He was a member of a team of economic advisors to President Soeharto
in the early years of the New Order administration. He served as the
minister of plantations from 1964 to 1966 and as the minister of
agriculture in 1966 under President Sukarno. He was finance minister
from 1966 to 1968 and minister of transportation from 1968 to 1973 under
President Soeharto. (emb)

Legislator deplores PDI candidate list

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A legislator criticized the government yesterday for
accepting the election candidate list from the rift-ridden Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI), saying that the list breached the electoral law.
   A.A. Oka Mahendra, a member of House Commission II for home affairs,
said in a hearing with Minister of Home Affairs Yogie S.M. that the PDI
had listed 903 legislative candidates although the law allowed 850 to be
listed.
   Oka said the electoral law stated that the number of legislative
candidates that a contesting group could propose was twice the number of
contested seats in the House.
   Next year, Golkar, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and the
United Development Party (PPP) will contest 425 seats in the 500-seat
House of Representatives. The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the
Armed Forces.
   Golkar and PPP have each submitted 850 names of legislative
candidates to the National Elections Institute.
   "Accepting a list with more than 850 candidates is against the law,"
said Oka, a House member from the ruling Golkar organization.
   Yogie, who is also chairman of the National Elections Institute, did
not answer Oka's objection. Yogie responded by saying that the electoral
law should be properly abided by.
   Separately, the secretary-general of the national elections
institute, Suryatna Subrata, said the institute would return the
proposed list to the PDI central board.
   "The PDI central board has to revise the list and nominate a maximum
of 850 names," Suryatna told reporters after the hearing.
   Oka questioned why the government had assigned the National Council
for Defense and Security, instead of the Minister of Home Affairs, to
develop guidelines on campaigning for next year's election.
   President Soeharto has asked the National Council for Defense and
Security to draw up new guidelines for the 1997 election campaign.
   "Why should the task go to the council? Is the Home Affairs Ministry
too busy supervising the existing three political organizations to do
it?" Oka asked.
   Yogie said that next year street rallies involving huge numbers of
people would no longer be permitted because they had the potential to
disturb security and public order.
   "We should develop an electioneering system which emphasizes each
party's programs on offer to potential voters. It would be more
educational politically," he said.
   On the heating political climate in the lead-up to the 1997 general
election, Yogie said it was still within tolerable limits. (imn)

Vote-getters not needed, political scholars say

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SEMARANG (JP): Political scholars said yesterday that the recruitment
of celebrities as vote-getters in next year's general election is an
outdated trick to attract voters.
   They said that vote-getters are effective only in uneducated
communities because on campuses and in the cities people know they need
politicians who can really defend their interests.
   Riswandha Imawan, a political scholar from Gadjah Mada University,
said that the use of vote-getters is a trick that tends to deceive the
public.
   The idea of recruiting vote-getters, he said, is to have celebrities
use their popularity rather than their political skill to attract as
many people as possible to vote for the party they represent.
   "Political studies should stop using vote-getters because it assumes
that people do not have enough of a grasp of the political games in
Indonesia," Riswandha said.
   "As Indonesians are increasingly educated, the vote-getting system
should be stopped," he said.
   The three political organizations: Golkar, the United Development
Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), will compete for
425 seats in the House of Representatives in next year's general
election.
   While the PDI and PPP do not have well-known figures in their front
lines, Golkar made headlines for recruiting king of dangdut music Rhoma
Irama, soap opera star Rano Karno and shadow puppet master Ki Anom
Suroto -- to name a few -- to attract voters.
   Golkar hopes to increase its domination in the House from its current
282 seats to at least 299. It wants to recapture the 16 seats it lost to
the PDI and one to the PPP in the 1992 election.
   Golkar has promised the much coveted seats to the popular
personalities.
   "Educated people will certainly ask why political organizations put
celebrities higher on their list of prospective House members than
professional politicians," said political observer Susilo Utomo from
Diponegoro University.
   "If it later turns out that the celebrities fail to defend the
public's interests as they promise during election campaigns, people
will feel cheated," he added.
   MT Arifin, rector of Surakarta Muhammadiyah University, has proposed
that political organizations stop recruiting vote-getters because their
political ability is questionable.
   He argued that those representing the people in the House should be
people who are well-versed in politics and have the courage to defend
average people, not just their peers.
   "The vote-getting system should be stopped if Indonesia wants to see
democracy flourish," he said. (har/pan)

Internal dispute among labor exporters drags on

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): The row in the Association of Labor Export Companies
(Apjati) heightened yesterday with the government-backed leader
threatening to take his opponents to court unless they surrendered the
funds belonging to the association.
   Abdullah Puteh, the chairman of the government-backed executive
board, demanded the old board to surrender the association's bank
accounts and their books peacefully, or face a court order.
   He said he has asked banks to freeze the association's accounts,
which are still controlled by members of the old board.
   He did not give an estimate of the amount involved.
   "You figure it out yourself. Each member paid a membership fee of Rp
5 million (US$2,127) and workers have to pay Rp 20,000 each," Puteh told
reporters after he met with Minister of Manpower Abdullah Latief, who is
also the association's patron.
   Puteh, a politician of the ruling political group Golkar, was elected
as Apjati chairman in a congress attended by 111 of the association's
128 members last week. The congress was boycotted by members of the old
executive board, headed by Mahfudz Djaelani, who called the event
"unconstitutional".
   The industry has continually been beset by politicking by companies
amidst pressure from the government to restrict the number of companies
in what is regarded as a lucrative business.
   Apjati was established in May last year at the urging of the
government to instill some order in the industry. Lack of
professionalism among workers' exporting companies has been blamed for
some of the problems facing many Indonesian workers overseas.
   One of the tasks of the association was to run basic training courses
for Indonesians before they were sent abroad.
   Puteh said that during the meeting, Latief asked the association to
be run more professionally, and that its finances should be made
transparent.
   He promised that under his leadership, he would submit a financial
report every three months to members and the minister. "I have no
problem about transparency," he said.
   Anton Sihombing, secretary-general of the new board, disclosed that
the board plans to "borrow" between Rp 2 million and Rp 3 million from
each member to finance the association's activities.
   But the fees charged on workers sent abroad would be scrapped, he
said.
   The new board will be working out of an office at the Persada
Executive Club in Halim Perdanakusuma, East Jakarta, and not from the
GKBI building, the secretariat of the old board. (ste)

'Hairy pollution crisis in Lampung'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): Air pollution in the Lampung capital of Bandar Lampung
is so heavy that residents' hair is contaminated with industrial waste,
notably cadmium, an academic said yesterday.
   In her speech commemorating Lampung University's 31st anniversary,
Ida Farida Rivai said that her recent study on pollution in the city
proved that there was a direct relationship between intensive
industrialization and population concentration causing increased levels
of environmental contamination in cities.
   Ida, a chemistry expert, said that toxic industrial waste included
gas emissions from motorized vehicles and smoke and gases from
factories.
   Perpetual accumulation of heavy metal compounds such as cadmium, lead
and mercury is hazardous to humans, Ida, who graduated from the Gunma
University of Japan, said.
   Prolonged exposure to mercury destroys the nervous system, cadmium
diminishes the kidney's function and lead can cause lung cancer, she
said.
   Ida, the founder of the science department at the university, said
that chemical contamination and poisoning from industrial waste cannot
be minimized by rejecting industrialization.
   "Perhaps preventative measures and control can be socialized and
managed in a wiser manner," she said.
   Ida also encouraged chemists and biologists to undertake more
research on toxic waste by-products which are inadvertently consumed by
the public.
   "A thorough understanding of environmental toxicology is one way of
improving the quality human resources. It is futile to tell people of
the danger without providing a solution or telling them how to prevent
the danger," Ida said. (14)

NGOs demand controls on land ownership

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
yesterday renewed their long-held demand for a government regulation to
limit the size of land ownership across the country.
   On the eve of the 26th anniversary of the Land Reforms Law, the
Consortium of Agrarian Reforms said the 1960 legislation has not been
fully upheld, particularly on the question of limiting land ownership.
   The 1960 law recognizes the need to limit land acquisition to ensure
justice and recognizes the rights of indigenous people over land, said
consortium chairman Noer Fauzi Rachman.
   But the implementation has not lived up to the spirit of the law,
Noer said. "The 'social function' of the land as recognized by the law
has, in practice, become the 'business function.'"
   The 1960 Land Reforms Law was seen as a piece of landmark legislation
in the quest for justice in predominantly rural Indonesia. The
anniversary is marked each year either with a seminar or other
activities.
   Noer, whose consortium was founded two years ago by 65 NGOs to
educate people about their land rights, said the massive buying of land
is taking Indonesia back to the Dutch colonial era when plantation
owners were allowed to possess massive land tracts.
   Now more than 64 million hectares of land in the country are owned by
20 business groups, he said. Most of the land bought had been recognized
by customary laws as being owned by the indigenous people.
   Noer criticized State Minister of Agrarian Affairs/Chairman of the
National Land Agency Soni Harsono for saying over the weekend that
preserving customary laws would be a "step backward".
   Speaking in Yogyakarta, Soni, as reported by Antara, said customary
laws regarding land ownership would disappear as Indonesia develops
further.
   With the trend toward individual land ownership, these customary laws
would eventually die a natural death, he was quoted as saying. He said
the government will continue to respect customary laws, but will not
help preserve them.
   The government marks the anniversary of the 1960 law more quietly
because the legislation was often associated with the Indonesian
Communist Party (PKI). The party, banned since 1966, politicized the
1960 law, turning it into a tool to force land redistribution.
   Noer shared the view that the 1960 law has been mistakenly considered
as communist-sponsored legislation.
   "The content of the law was actually prepared by land experts from
Gadjah Mada University of Yogyakarta," he said.
   He said the unfortunate association with the PKI is one of the
reasons why reforms have been slow and why massive land buying continues
unchecked.
   Many timber estates, oil palm plantations and the pulp industry have
been built on vast forest tracts that were originally part of the local
people's customary land, he said.
   "The government has often labeled the indigenous people as 'forest
wanderers', but really they are people who inhabit the forest and live
by cultivating it," Noer said. (16)

7-day cruise to Banda Islands

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A new seven-day cruise to the Banda islands, known as
the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, will operate for the first time to
coincide with the island's annual Kora Kora boat race from Nov. 12 to
Nov. 19.
   Sailing on the Modern Group's Awani Dream, the tour will cast off
from Bali's Benoa harbor on Nov. 12 and will call first at Komodo
island. On Nov. 15, the ship will arrive in Bandaneira and be greeted by
dozens of Kora Kora boats, which will escort the ship to the quay.
   "The Kora Kora boats symbolize the heroism of Banda's natives as the
boats were used in the defense of Banda against the colonists," State
Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Hayono Isman says. (ste)

Medication too pricey for 50% of TB sufferers

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): About 50 percent of the 500,000 Indonesians taking
medication for their tuberculosis (TB) stop half-way through the course
of treatment because they are too poor to continue it, a health activist
said yesterday.
   Chairwoman of the Indonesian Foundation for Tuberculosis Eradication
Mrs. Soepardjo Rustam said that the price of the second round of
medication is more expensive than the first.
   TB can be cured within six months, she said, but many sufferers who
undergo medical treatment fail to complete the entire process; some
because they are too poor, others because they think they have already
recovered the moment they stop coughing.
   "Consequently, they have to repeat the medication," she said after
meeting with President Soeharto.
   Community health centers can ask for free TB medicine from the
association for poor patients," Mrs. Soepardjo, wife of the late
coordinating minister for people's welfare, said.
   According to her, TB bacteria can be found everywhere and people who
are physically or mentally tired are particularly prone to contracting
the disease.
   She said her foundation offers Rp 80,000 (US$34) in transport costs
to all TB patient who are too poor to go to the nearest health center
for further medication.
   She said that there are currently about 500,000 Indonesians suffering
from contagious TB and guessed that there are about 500,000 others who
have not reported their illness.
   In 1993 the World Health Organization estimated that 1.9 billion
people, or one in every three worldwide, are infected with the disease.
In the next decade, 300 million more people will become infected, 90
million people will develop the disease, and 30 million people will die
of it, according to the organization's research. (ste)

Public participation in crime prevention sought

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta Police Chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata called on
the public yesterday to join the battle against crime in the city.
   "Caring about others' fate should be developed to build togetherness
to fight crime," the two-star general said in a weekly ceremony at the
headquarters prior to handing over rewards to a number of police
personnel and civilians.
   "Discard the ego which has become the trademark of metropolitan
people," said Hamami.
   "Should we let a person become a victim of a crime, we could be the
next victim," he said.
   That's why, he said, active public participation in fighting crime is
absolutely necessary.
   "The limited number of Jakarta police personnel and a shortage of
equipment required for their operations could be compensated by public
cooperation in making the city secure," said Hamami.
   Shortly after the ceremony, the police chief handed rewards, in the
form of certificates and cash, to three security guards for their
outstanding efforts in fighting crime.
   Among the three were M. Dasri, 66, a security guard at the residence
of Egyptian Ambassador Mahmoed Mohamed Osman in Menteng, Central
Jakarta.
   Dasri lost two fingers and suffered a serious head wound last week
fight when he struggled with at least five criminals in the
neighborhood.
   On behalf of the police force, Hamami handed Dasri Rp 500,000
(US$212.80) in recognition of his performance.
   "I really appreciate the present, which I can use for my medical
treatment which so far has cost me Rp 400,000," said Dasri.
   "The police gift means a lot to me and my family because I have
received nothing from my employer," continued Dasri, who works for Rp
140,000 per month.
   A reader of The Jakarta Post also presented Dasri with Rp 250,000 to
help with his medical expenses.
   Besides Dasri, Hamami also presented Rp 100,000 to two other security
guards, Mat Sani, 26, and Pulung Mahmudin, 30, for their roles in
stopping a group of burglars in front of the BCA bank in Penjaringan,
North Jakarta, in June.
   Hamami also presented cloth to 41 police officers, who were
considered meritorious but unable to buy new uniforms while they awaited
uniform distribution from the National Police headquarters.
   The police chief then gave rewards to nine police officers who
participated in the recent national sports games and collected medals.
   Each of the nine officers received a certificate and Rp 750,000 in
cash. (bsr)

   JAKARTA (JP): A road construction worker has been crushed to death by
a steamroller driven by a friend in the East Parking Lot, Senayan,
Central Jakarta.
   Lasman, the victim, was asleep on the road he and his friends were
repairing early yesterday morning when his colleague Azis decided to
move the steamroller to another place.
   Azis told police that after traveling a few meters he noticed that
the steamroller was running unsmoothly. He said he thought the machine
was running over a heap of garbage or soil. He was horrified to see that
the body of Lasman, who hailed from the same town of Banyumas, Central
Java, had been broken under the steamroller's steel wheel.
   Azis screamed hysterically before other workers came, the Terbit

Sarwono hails idea to build homes on stilts

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja is
in favor of a proposal that homes in water catchment areas be built on
stilts.
   The proposal, from South Jakarta Mayor Pardjoko, was among other
suggestions to help preserve water catchment areas.
   "But the municipality should serve as an example and build its
offices on stilts" in such areas, Sarwono said.
   Locations in the mayoralty have been designated as the city's main
water catchment areas. However, given the relatively cooler climate,
they are also favorite sites for residential areas.
   Sarwono had earlier addressed a seminar, which was held by the
mayoralty, on preserving South Jakarta as a water catchment area.
   Sarwono also urged that more information be given to residents on the
need to build more water catchment wells.
   Given the decreasing amount of water catchment areas, the mayor said
houses planned for construction on plots of less than 500 square meters
should be built on stilts.
   The districts of Jagakarsa, part of Cilandak and a part of Pasar
Minggu, all in South Jakarta, are particularly designated for water
catchment areas. The current rule states that building is allowed on a
maximum of 20 percent of the plots in the districts. In order for a
building permit to be issued, a plot must be a minimum of 500 square
meters.
   A further decrease in water catchment areas in South Jakarta is also
indicated by only two remaining natural ponds, the Mangga Bolong and
Babakan ponds.
   Pardjoko, Sarwono added, could easily secure support from high-
ranking residents on policies to preserve water catchments, as "most
ministers live in South Jakarta".
   Pardjoko had also proposed that the city change rules on building
limitations in water catchment areas.
   But Pardjoko said given the increasing price of land, violations were
likely to become rampant because many residents had smaller-sized plots.
More buildings will be found without building permits, he said.
   A way out of this problem, he said, would be to make mandatory the
provision of collective areas for groundwater preservation.
   He said this was suggested six months ago to the municipality, which
is working on the idea.
   The central government or the municipality, Pardjoko said, could buy
the necessary plots from residents, but he acknowledged the source of
funds might be a problem.
   Deputy Governor for Developmental Affairs, Tb.M. Rais, said in his
address that a maximum of 35 percent, or 800 million cubic meters of
annual rainfall, enters into the ground. From this figure, he said the
city's annual groundwater potential is around 77 million cubic meters
per year.
   As the safe limit for groundwater use is up to 70 percent, or 48
million cubic meters per year, Rais reiterated warnings that the intake
has become critical. The city-owned water company, PDAM Jaya, has only
catered to 48 percent of homes in Jakarta. (anr)

Lawyers demand acquittal of client

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): The defense lawyers of a man charged with murdering the
owner of a recording studio asked the North Jakarta District Court
yesterday to acquit him of all charges.
   "Our client is accused of complicity with two other men in the murder
of the late Beng Seng," said Tommy Sihotang, the leading counsel for the
defense, "so, to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt whether
TP, alias Opiu, was involved in the murder, the prosecutor should have
presented the two key witnesses to testify."
   Nyo Beng Seng was killed in his mansion in Pluit, North Jakarta. Also
known as Darmansyah Sujadi, Beng Seng was the owner of a leading
recording company, PT. Irama Tara, and several massage parlors and night
clubs in Jakarta.
   The businessman was stabbed to death with a samurai sword. His death
drew much public attention because it was widely believed to have been
linked to fierce competition in the entertainment industry.
   Police believe the murder was masterminded by renowned gambler Hong
Lie, who is still at large. He denied being involved in the murder at a
press interview in Singapore last year.
   The two key witnesses, Agiono bin Syafran and Sudartono, alias Atok,
were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years imprisonment respectively in
August last year.
   Prosecutor Muhammad Yusuf told the court in earlier sessions that he
did not call the two witnesses to the trial because they were imprisoned
in Nusa Kambangan, a prison island off the coast of Central Java.
   Defense lawyer Tommy Sihotang said the prosecutor had recited the
testimonies given by the two witnesses to the police instead of hearing
the witnesses' testimonies in court.
   "Article 185(1) of the Criminal Code Procedures dictate that
witnesses' testimonies are those given in court, not those given to the
police," Tommy said.
   He then presented a letter from one of the witnesses in Nusa
Kambangan claiming that Opiu had nothing to do with the murder.
   Prosecutor Yusuf had told the court that Opiu drove Agiono to Beng
Seng's mansion on April 7, 1994, and gave him Rp 5 million (US$2,200).
He said that Agiono used the money to purchase a motorcycle on which he
escaped after the murder a week later.
   Yusuf accused Opiu, of violating Article 56 of the Criminal Code
which states that anyone who helps another party to commit a capital
crime is liable to a maximum of 15 years imprisonment.
   When asked to rebut the defense lawyers' statement, Yusuf said he
maintained his earlier sentencing demand.
   Judge Suwardi adjourned the trial for two weeks to prepare the
verdict. (26)

Clarity requested for 'public info campaign'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): The City Council would like the municipality to explain
the effectiveness of its Rp 4 billion campaign to familiarize the public
with city regulations, deputy council speaker Ismunandar said yesterday.
   The city's public relations office reportedly questioned the deputy
speaker's request, who responded by saying that he was not singling out
any one particular office of the municipality for its fund-handling
methods.
   Councilor Romulus Sihombing of Commission D for development affairs
said last week that both the city's legal department and the public
relations office are the offices most involved in the campaign.
   City Council Speaker M.H. Ritonga earlier conveyed his impression
that many Jakartans are still in the dark about city regulations and
questioned the allocation of the Rp 4 billion (US$1.7 million).
   The city information budget for this fiscal year climbed to Rp 4.131
billion, an increase over last year's Rp 3.61. The budget includes Rp
825 million for a "public information project."
   Meanwhile, the legal department has been allocated Rp 1.07 billion to
disseminate information about recently passed legislation and current
bills.
   City public relations officer Soesilo Darmoadji recently sent a
letter to several newspapers in response to the recent queries. He said
that the funds being used in the campaign are also at the disposal of
other offices, including the Ministry of Information's branch in
Jakarta.
   "We ask for an explanation from the municipality, which could send
representatives from the public relations office to explain the use of
campaign funds to the council," Ismunandar said.
   "We would then suggest that the public relations office coordinate
the other offices which it says are also privy to the funds."
   Helmy AR Syihab, the head of Commission C for city revenues, said
that his commission will formally raise the issue when it meets with
municipality executives to discuss the city budget in October. (anr)

Defendant tells court of previous 'sin'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   TANGERANG, West Java (JP): A 41-year-old woman standing trial for
allegedly attempting to smuggle 9,000 Ecstasy pills into Indonesia told
the Tangerang District Court yesterday that she had twice succeeded in
smuggling the drug into the country in 1993 and 1994.
   "In 1993 I managed to smuggle 200 Ecstasy pills from the Netherlands
into Indonesia through the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. The
following year I smuggled in 300 pills," ELW told the court presided
over by Judge M. Nawir.
   Motivated by her desire to make a large sum of money, the defendant
confessed that she stashed 9,000 pills in her suitcase and sports shoes
and attempted to enter the country on March 27 through Soekarno-Hatta
Airport, where she was apprehended by customs and excise officials.
   "In The Hague I bought for 10 guilder (Rp 14,000) each. I intended to
sell the pills in Jakarta for Rp 30,000 each," she said.
   She claimed that she bought the pills from someone named Sonny Luis
Lai in The Hague. She then boarded a Lufthansa flight.
   If found guilty, the defendant could be imprisoned for up to 15 years
and fined up to Rp 300 million.
   The defendant's lawyers, Nuryanto and Rusdi Sovian, earlier asked the
court to drop the charges against their client.
   According to the lawyers, Health Regulation No.23/1992 cannot be used
to convict their client.
   The lawyers argued that only institutions, professional and business
groups having expertise in public health are subject to the regulation,
not individuals.
   The defendant has no expertise in public health and had the Ecstasy
pills just because she thought the pills could make her a lot of money,
the lawyers said.
   The trial was adjourned until Monday when prosecutor Sarwono will
read his sentence appeal.
   Last Thursday the West Jakarta District Court sentenced Ng Wi Hon,
alias Awi, 56, to 10 months imprisonment after finding him guilty of
trafficking Ecstasy pills.
   The case, the first of its kind in Jakarta, followed an intensive
government campaign against the abuse of Ecstasy.
   The government has been forced to use the 1992 Health Law to
prosecute people because Ecstasy is not yet classified as a narcotic,
and therefore is not covered under the 1976 Narcotics Law. (28/bas)

Idea on Jabotabek needs clear planning: Ginandjar

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): State Minister of National Development Planning
Ginandjar Kartasasmita says the idea to unite Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang
and Bekasi (Jabotabek) into one province under one governor of
ministerial level reflects the complicated development problems in the
area.
   Ginandjar said if the idea was accepted, the supporting systems and
all legal aspects should be thoroughly prepared.
   "The idea aired by Pak Emil (Prof. Emil Salim) mirrors his concern
about the complex problems in Jabotabek," Ginandjar was quoted by Antara
as saying.
   Emil Salim, former state minister for both population and
environment, said two weeks ago that the Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and
Bekasi area needs one governor of a ministerial level to anticipate
future challenges.
   He said such a move would enable better management to enhance
services in the capital city as well as support decentralization, which
is needed for future economic autonomy.
   "That is a positive idea. However, clear systems must be prepared for
that," Ginandjar said.
   Presently, governors are elected or proposed by the provincial
legislative councils, while ministers are appointed by the President.
   He said that comprehensive discussions on development in Jabotabek
are needed, citing poverty eradication programs as the main focus to
develop an area like Jabotabek.
   Minister of Home Affairs Moch. Yogie S.M. said earlier that such an
idea requires comprehensive feasibility studies.
   West Java Governor R. Nuriana has said on separate occasions that the
idea could create many problems. One of the problems that should be
tackled is the formulation of the size and status of the new province.
   Ginandjar, who is also chairman of the National Development Planning
Board (Bappenas), said that his office does not specifically handle the
development of Jabotabek. "Bappenas deals with the development of
densely-populated areas in connection with master spatial planning," he
said.
   Ginandjar said he has not looked into the possible economic benefit
Jabotabek would gain from becoming a single province.
   Efforts to deal and synchronize the development of Jakarta, Bogor,
Tangerang and Bekasi have been made by the government by setting up a
coordination body in early 1980s.
   However, according to urban experts, the body has failed in its
function as Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi have their own targets
and concerns with their respective development programs.

Military

   Meanwhile, Bekasi regent Moch. Djamhari said yesterday that Jabotabek
would need a greater military command under one commander, a lieutenant
general, should they be merged into one province.
   Djamhari, an army lieutenant colonel, said this at a meeting with
Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Sutiyoso and hundreds of local
public figures.
   The regent said that a greater military command would need to be
headed by an officer of at least lieutenant general in rank if the
province was to be headed by a governor with ministerial level authority
as suggested by Emil Salim.
   Djamhari said that a greater military command would enhance order and
security in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.
   Bekasi is a regency under the West Java provincial administration,
but in military and security matters it is controlled by the Jakarta
military command and the Jakarta police headquarters. (sur/kod)

Our art for sale?

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   The current furor over the aborted auction in Singapore of two
paintings that were allegedly stolen from the National Museum's
collection in Jakarta once again puts the spotlight on the lamentable
conditions of our museums and monuments. The two paintings -- Portrait
of a Dutch Governor Wearing the Willems Order by the 19th century
Indonesian master Raden Saleh and Metamorphosis, a nude painting by
Basoeki Abdullah -- are believed to be among at least six paintings
missing in recent years from the National Museum in Jakarta. More sadly,
the thefts might never have become known to the public were it not for
the fact that public attention was focused on Christie's auction and
that some people questioned the origin of two of the paintings listed in
their catalog.
   Indonesians and Jakartans especially are right to be proud of their
National Museum. Its collection of ancient Hindu-Javanese art objects is
unrivaled. Its collection of antique Chinese and Southeast Asian
ceramics is reputed to be among the best and largest in this part of the
world. Its numismatic collection and its collection of gold artifacts
stand up to comparison with those of any other museum in this region.
   Yet, this showpiece of Indonesian museums has been said by some
observers, in several respects, to resemble no more than a warehouse for
the storage of art objects. This appears to be particularly true in the
case of paintings. It wasn't such a long time ago that newspapers
reported that a number of paintings by contemporary French masters,
donated during the 1950s, had disappeared. Others were damaged because
of neglect.
   Paintings, however, are not the only art objects that are vulnerable
to theft. About a decade ago, about 20 pieces were reported stolen from
the museum's collection of antique Chinese and Southeast Asian ceramics.
A big furor arose over the incident and measures were reportedly taken
to step up the museum's security. Yet, as far as is known to the public,
none of the pieces appear to have been recovered or traced.
   If such incidents can occur at Jakarta's National Museum, which is
the showpiece of Indonesian museums, one would hate to think of what
could happen in museums of lesser standing in our big cities or in
museums in the more remote areas of this archipelago. The Kutai Museum
in Tenggarong, East Kalimantan, for example, was reputed to house a
magnificent collection of antique ceramics. There, too, many pieces are
said to have since disappeared.
   The picture becomes even more dismal, of course, when one takes into
consideration the fact that many art treasures have also been reported
stolen from our ancient temples and other archaeological sites. Years
ago, the heads of stone figures at the Bima temple in the Dieng complex
in Central Java -- one of the most ancient of Hindu temples in Indonesia
-- were reportedly chopped off by thieves. Similar cases of vandalism
for the sake of monetary gain have occurred in numerous other sites.
   It is a sad fact that it appears that thieves are among the first of
us to recognize the value of our art objects. It is well enough known
that art nowadays is in many cases no longer something to be appreciated
for its esthetic value only. People with more businesslike dispositions
have long appreciated the fact that many art objects, paintings in
particular, make good investments. Hence, the flourishing of not only
private galleries, but also of art theft around the world.
   Protecting our art objects by stepping up security, proper cataloging
and improving treatment in storage and during displays are obviously
among the first steps that must be taken. It is to simplify matters,
however, to say that these tasks belong to museum curators only. The
public and private institutions, with the support of private business,
can and should help by raising the necessary funds and especially a
greater public awareness of the value of our art objects.
   As for the present, the best we can do is to try to recover what has
been unduly taken from our national art collections. This,
unfortunately, is not an easy task to accomplish. In time, with better
funding and with growing public appreciation, we hope that our art
treasures can be housed in the proper, modern edifices which they
deserve.

Visa card surcharges

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   Thanks to Ms. Pauline Sahetapy for reaffirming my view that
surcharges on payments with Visa card or in fact with any credit card
are illegal.
   What she omits, however, is to mention what Visa and the card issuing
banks are going to do in order to stop this widespread practice.
   I am using my Swiss Visa card frequently, that's what it is here for.
If a shop assistant or cashier, who after all are only following orders,
mention a surcharge, usually between 3 and 5 percent, I ask her or him
to write this clearly on the credit slip, so that I could claim it back
from Visa Switzerland.
   In over 90 percent of the cases, sometimes after consulting the boss,
no such charge is added. If my ploy fails, I will sign the credit slip
and then send it together with the cash register slip or receipt to
Visa, who, without any fuss will credit my next statement. I suggest
that all cardholders do the same. As this process will mean a lot of
work for the banks they may kneel on their contract partners -- the
shops.
   The card issuing banks on the other hand should inform their
customers of their right to refuse surcharges, not just encourage them
to report errant shop-owners, and that without telling us what the
consequences, if any, are.

Dewi A. Rais Abin

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   Thank you for printing on Sept. 21 a photograph of my husband and I
on the occasion of the launching of my book Notes from Sinai: A
Nostalgia on Sept. 20.
   I would like to clarify that my husband, retired Lt.Gen. Rais Abin,
is a former commander of the United Nations Emergency Force-Middle East.
The force comprised seven contingents from seven countries: Canada,
Finland, Sweden, Ghana, Indonesia, Australia and Poland. He was not the
commander of the Indonesian contingent which you referred to as the
Indonesian Peacekeeping Force. The Indonesian Peacekeeping Force was the
Indonesian contingent usually called Batt. Garuda.
   The Indonesian contingent was one among seven contingents of other
countries which were assigned to the United Nations Emergency Force-
Middle East. My husband happened to be force's commander.

Polio vaccine safe

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   It is most unfortunate that a child died on the day of National
Immunization Day and gave the impression to some that this death was
associated with polio vaccine (Sept. 12, 1996). Careful investigation by
the health authorities found that this child had been ill for several
days and happened to receive a dose of polio vaccine orally hours prior
to his death. There is no logical association of the death of this child
with the oral polio vaccine.
   We wish to point out that with more than 200 million doses of oral
polio vaccine given annually worldwide, there is not a single known
adverse effect within hours after vaccination. The short term safety
record of oral polio is incontrovertibly established. It is through such
efforts as the National Immunization days that Indonesia has an
excellent chance of eliminating polio within the next few years. We hope
this incident, which is not related to polio vaccine, will not detract
from the current effort of eliminating one of the most deadly disease of
childhood.
   What is more unfortunate than the case reported on Sept. 12 however
is the unreported fact that 1000 under-five children still die everyday
in Indonesia, mainly as a result of relatively easily preventable
illness, and that the Ministry of Health and ourselves are committed to
dramatically reduce this toll. This effort deserves financial and other
support from all sectors of society.

Museums need help to protect cultural legacy

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 7

   JAKARTA (JP): Fine art is becoming more popular in Indonesia, but
this new found appreciation is not all positive.
   When at least six paintings were allegedly stolen from the National
Museum recently, the thieves took advantage of the dilapidated condition
of Indonesian museums.
   There are now more painters and art collectors in Indonesia, and the
works of a few painters have improved tremendously. There are also
significant increases in the quantity and quality of art exhibitions
held by galleries. The galleries are being run with increasing
professionalism. And art writers are working with them closely to
promote their shows.
   While the artists, galleries and art writers have been quick to meet
the challenge of an Indonesian art boom, museums have failed to develop
as quickly, due to their limited budgets and authority. "I feel sorry
about what happened at the National Museum, but honestly it could easily
have happened in any museum in Indonesia. We need to give more attention
to the registration and storage systems of our museums," said Sudarmadji
Damais, the head of Jakarta History Museum at Taman Fatahillah, Central
Jakarta.
   The government is beginning to pay more attention to its museums, but
its efforts need public and private sector support.
   The public must pay more attention to its museums. "We need to be
more respectful toward our cultural heritage," said Guruh Soekarnoputra,
an artist and art collector, in response to the recent theft. Hopefully
this incident will make the community pay more attention toward cultural
patrimony in Indonesia, especially toward art in museums.
   The municipal government of Jakarta is working hard to improve its
museums. Its own fine art museum is being renovated in response to
greater public interest in art, particularly in paintings.
   Perhaps the time has come for both the public and the private sector
to establish museums which are not merely warehouses for works of art
and culture, but also institutions of learning through the display of
educational exhibits and places where people can enjoy and pursue their
interests. It seems that it is time for the concept of a National Art
Gallery to be planned and realized.

Mystery of missing RI paintings puzzles art world

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 7

By Amir Sidharta

   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian art world was shocked by the news of the
alleged theft of six paintings from Jakarta's National Museum. Even more
shocking was the fact that at least two of the allegedly stolen
paintings, A Nude (Metamorphosis)  by Basoeki Abdullah and Portrait of a
Dutch Governor Wearing the Willems Order by Raden Saleh, may have been
included in the catalog of the upcoming Christie's auction in early
October 1996.
   A cartoon by GM Sudarta published in last Friday's Kompas showed a
Christie's employee auctioning the Bronze elephant which symbolizes the
National Museum, also popularly known as Gedung Gajah or "Elephant
Building".  It clearly implied that the 230-year-old auction house was
in the business of auctioning off Indonesia's national treasures.
   In fact, the alleged theft would have probably not been revealed if
it were not for the publication of the auction catalog. Members of the
Basoeki Abdullah estate recognized lot 319 in the catalog, A Nude,  as
Metamorphosis, one of the paintings that was in the custody of the
National Museum. Meanwhile, lot 363 bore great resemblance to a painting
reproduced in a catalog published by the Directorate of Culture of the
Ministry of Education and Culture, in preparation for the National Art
Gallery in 1988. The pictures in the catalog were almost identical.
There was a green stain on the figure's trousers, and damage was seen in
the same location on both reproductions. The only difference was that in
the later publication (the Christie's catalog), to the right of  the
figure's face, the painting had been torn and poorly restored.
   Although auction houses mainly facilitate the sale of artworks at the
highest possible prices according to the market condition in a certain
region, they also become centers of documentation. "That is why we need
Christie's. It records much of the changing of hands in the world of
art," said Sudarmadji Damais, head of the Jakarta History Museum at
Taman Fatahilah after hearing about the alleged theft last week.
   "Christie's often helps locate stolen art," someone in the field of
art auctions explained. Perhaps it has in other parts of the world. But
in this case, we can only hope that the paintings will be returned.
   The reappearance of allegedly stolen Indonesian paintings in
Christie's auction of Southeast Asian paintings has happened previously.
One of Ida Bagus Made's 14 paintings, which was stolen a while ago, and
a Basoeki Abdullah's from the collection of former president Sukarno
were offered at the Christie's auction in March 1995. However, because
of insufficient evidence, no investigation was pursued. Neither Ida
Bagus Made nor Guruh Soekarnoputra, the youngest son of the late
president Sukarno, filed police reports when the paintings were stolen
or found missing. The inclusion of the painting in the album entitled
Paintings in the Collection of President Sukarno, compiled by Dullah,
apparently was not sufficient proof of theft. "It is Christie's policy
not to reveal the identity of either the seller or the buyer of the
artworks in their auctions," explained art writer Agus Dermawan, who is
an avid observer of Indonesian auction trends. Therefore, the alleged
theft could not be traced.
   Whether or not Christie's can be required by law to reveal the
identity of the seller in the case of the two paintings allegedly stolen
from Indonesia's National Museum will depend on the laws in Singapore.
Laws concerning stolen goods differ from country to country. According
to a prominent Japanese art dealer, in Japan, when a stolen painting has
been sold, it becomes the legal right of the buyer, and the original
owners have to buy the painting back from the new owner. In other
countries, legal ownership depends on whether the purchase was made
before or after the official report of theft was reported to the police.

Time

   At this point, we can only predict the time of the alleged theft and
the characteristics of the alleged thief. It might be helpful to try to
analyze the mystery. Considering that it takes at least three months
before artworks can be included of artworks in a Christie's auction, Art
observer Agus Dermawan T. estimates that the paintings were allegedly
stolen before June.
   Taking into account the fact that the estimated prices of the
paintings were still quite reasonable, it seems that the paintings were
probably stolen before the sale of Raden Saleh's Deer Hunt  in late
March of this year. If the alleged theft took place after the news of
this landmark sale, the alleged thieves would certainly expect rather
high prices, at least for the Raden Saleh, and therefore would have
increased the expected reserve price in the auction.
   Unfortunately, the reserves for the pieces remain confidential.
However, it seems that the price of portrait still within reasonable
limits and is therefore considered suitable for auction.
   It seems that the theft also may have occurred after the publication
of the Christie's catalog of the March auction. The catalog revealed the
high estimate of the piece to parties interested in Indonesian art. High
prices for Indonesian art may have seduced the alleged culprits to steal
the Raden Saleh which they knew was in the neglected possession of the
National Museum. It is also possible that the pieces were stolen even
earlier, perhaps after the announcement of the auction of the Deer Hunt
late last year or earlier this year. Profile
   In terms of the profile of the alleged thief/thieves, we can almost
be sure that the seller of the paintings was not involved in the alleged
theft, unless he/she were completely naive. As this case has proven, the
inclusion of stolen items in auctions tends to reveal cases of alleged
theft.
   It seems safe to say that the paintings have changed hands at least
twice before the paintings reach the seller. We can assume that the
alleged theft was masterminded by someone who had reasonable knowledge
of art, and even knew that there was a Raden Saleh in the National
Museum's collection placed in its storage area.
   If there had been any indication of forced entry into the museum's
storage space, the theft would have been revealed immediately. It is
almost certain that no sign of forced entry to the storage facility was
traced, because the theft which, based on reliable sources, happened at
least three months ago, was only revealed two weeks ago. This suggests
the involvement of insiders.

Worth

   Basoeki Abudllah's A Nude has been estimated as being worth between
S$8,000 to S$12,000. Was it worth stealing? If the piece was expected to
sell at around Rp 20 million, then, minus commissions and other
expenses, the seller would have bought it for Rp 12 million at most.
Therefore, we can assume that the persons behind the alleged theft paid
less than Rp 2.5 million for the job.
   Then we can almost be sure that the six paintings were stolen as a
lot, and later sold to the seller as a lot as well. The Raden Saleh is
estimated between S$100,000 to S$150,000. If the painting were to be
sold (which I doubt, because of its poor condition), I think it would
only reach the low end of the estimate. At Rp 165 million, minus
commissions and expenses, the seller would have bought it for around Rp
100 million. For this painting, the alleged culprits behind the theft
may have paid Rp 20 million for the job. Coupled with the other
paintings in the lot, the value of the job may have reached Rp 30
million. This amount would presumably be divided among two to three
persons. Although the sum, averaging Rp 10 million, might not seem
large, it is actually still quite substantial, considering the wages of
government employees in this country.
   If the involvement of insiders is revealed, then punishment is of
course necessary. However, we should not treat the involved insiders as
having sold national treasures, even though they are in the National
Museum's collection. It should be taken into account that the paintings
most likely had been neglected in the museum's storage space and treated
as insignificant pieces.
   Of more crucial importance is to reveal the masterminds of this
alleged theft. It should be stressed that the masterminds have
significant knowledge about art, including Indonesian art, and the
existence of important paintings in certain collections in the
government. They also seem to know that some key paintings are kept in
storage spaces of certain museums, although cooperation with insiders
may lead them to this kind of information. Certainly, there is
possibility that it is the work of a syndicate, which may also be
involved in other art crimes, including art forgery, which is also
rapidly developing in the country.

Concessionaires told to set aside wood for locals

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Forestry Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo said
yesterday only 45 forest concessionaires, or about 10 percent of the
total number, have allocated a portion of their log harvests for local
communities.
   He said that 405 out of about 450 forest concessionaires operating in
Indonesia have yet to set aside at least 5 percent of their log harvests
for local people, as stipulated by the government earlier this year.
   The stipulation not only calls for the concessionaires to provide
locals with quality wood, but also to ensure an adequate supply at
marketplaces at reasonable prices.
   Speaking at a hearing with members of the House of Representatives
Commission IV on forestry and agricultural affairs, Djamaludin said the
total log volume obtained from the 45 concessionaires has reached only
84,165 cubic meters.
   He said he would send warnings to the negligent concessionaires and
would revoke their concessions if they failed to respond after a third
warning.
   Djamaludin calculated that if log production from natural forests
currently reached 22.7 million cubic meters and if wood-processing cut
back this amount to 11 million cubic meters, then a 5 percent allocation
of the processed wood by each of the country's 450 concessionaires would
provide local communities with at least 550,000 cubic meters of wood.
   He considered the 84,165 cubic meters collected from concessionaires
so far as being far from satisfactory.
   Djamaludin said that the low supply of wood at local markets had led
to illegal trade of timber.
   Commenting on this issue, Director General of Forest Utilization
Titus Sarijanto was convinced that the government's campaign against
illegal trade of timber would not increase timber prices on the domestic
market.
   "The prices which are currently created with the existence of illegal
timber are abnormal. Once we can get rid of illegal timber, the market
will have its own way of creating the prices... And people will get used
to the new prices," he said.
   He was also confident that the situation would not cause a slump in
exports.
   "What the wood-processing industry must learn to do is give added
value to its products. This way, companies can get more revenues for the
same amount of wood harvested," he said.

Shortage

   According to recent reports, a number of large wood-processing
companies are currently suffering raw material shortages.
   Titus said the total production capacity of Indonesia's wood-
processing industries is presently 48.2 million cubic meters a year,
consisting of 31.95 million cubic meters for the sawmill industry and
16.25 million cubic meters for the plywood industry.
   The wood-processing industries, however, have an operational capacity
of only 45 million to 46 million cubic meters a year.
   Meanwhile, supplies for these industries, which include a certain
amount of trees cut from the opening up of the one million hectares of
peat land in Central Kalimantan, reach only about 36 million cubic
meters a year.
   As a way out, the government has encouraged the industries to apply
technologies with minimum waste and restructure their machinery.
   Titus said yesterday there are currently technologies that can help
companies carry out such short-term plans.
   These include installing machinery that is capable of peeling off
layers of wood barks until the core diameter of a log reaches seven
centimeters -- smaller than the 20 to 25 centimeter diameter core
produced by most machinery currently used -- and cutting back on
industrial waste from 30 percent to 20 percent.
   "This waste can further be burned to generate the boilers used in the
plywood industry," he said.
   Titus said Indonesia's plywood industry production reached nine
million cubic meters a year, while state revenues obtained from this
sector in the past five years reached an average of US$4.5 million each
year, with an increasing trend. (pwn)

PT Gobel diversifies to build three-star hotel

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): PT Gobel Development Corporation, a major electronics
manufacturer, is entering the hotel business by constructing a three
star-hotel on Jl. Saharjo in South Jakarta.
   The planned hotel, to be called Hotel Clarion Jakarta, is owned by PT
Dharmagraha Nusantara, a Gobel subsidiary, and will be managed by PT
Choice Hotels Indonesia, the master license holder of Choice Hotels
International of the United States.
   The ground breaking ceremony of the US$125 million hotel took place
yesterday and was led by a Gobel commissioner, Abdullah Gobel, Choice's
executive chairman, David Schaefer, and the chief of the Jakarta office
of the Ministry of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Pudjo Basuki.
   Gobel said that the planned eight-story hotel will include 172 rooms,
a business center, meeting rooms, a conference hall, a swimming pool,
restaurants and a health center.
   The hotel is expected to open in early 1998 and to employ some 250
Indonesians, he said.
   Pudjo admitted that the 1.5-year construction period is relatively
short for such a project.
   "I am quite happy that this hotel will be up and running soon. There
are currently 11 star-rated hotel projects in Jakarta delayed by the
owners, mostly owing to financial problems."
   A number of star-rated hotels in Jakarta are currently carrying out
renovation or expansion projects, including the Borobudur Inter-
Continental and Le Meridien, while dozens of new star-rated hotels, such
as the Conrad, the Marriott, the Kempinski, the Marco Polo, the Traders
and the Park Lane, are being prepared to open in the city in the next
few years.
   However, Pudjo said, Jakarta might lack star-rated hotel-rooms if the
growth rate is slow and more hotel projects are delayed. He refused to
name the delayed hotel projects.
   "Jakarta now has some 18,000 star-rated hotel rooms. This figure is
expected to increase to 30,000 by the year 2000."
   Choice currently operates six hotels, in Yogyakarta, Bandung and
Anyer in West Java, Parapat in North Sumatra and Pacung and Taman Mumbul
in Bali.
   Choice expects to see four hotels open in 1997, located in the
Central Java city of Surakarta, Batam in Riau, Carita beach in West Java
and Surabaya in East Java.
   In addition to the Clarion Jakarta, Choice will also manage two
further hotels, in Palembang in South Sumatra and Bogor in West Java in
1998.
   Today Choice, which uses Quality, Clarion, Comfort and Sleep as it
brands, is scheduled to sign an agreement with the Lippo Group to manage
the Carita Clarion Suites at the Carita beach in West Java. (icn)

ACeS gets US$60 million loan

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta-based satellite operator PT Asia Cellular
Satellite (ACeS) signed a US$60 million loan facility yesterday from a
domestic financial consortium led by the state-owned PT Danareksa
Finance.
   The nonrevolving bridge finance facility was prepared by Danareksa
($15.5 million), Bank PDFCI ($15.5 million), Bank Niaga ($15.5 million),
Bank Dagang dan Industri ($3.5 million) and Panin Bank ($10 million).
   Reksadana's president, Edgar Ekaputra, said that the loan syndication
was the first ever for a satellite project in the country.
   "This is the first time that financial institutions have joined
together in supporting the infrastructure development of the satellite
industry," he said.
   He acknowledged that the satellite-based telecommunications business
is complicated, causing the consortium to pledge only $60 million in
loans.
   "ACeS plans to look for bigger loans, but we will learn together
first about the satellite business," Ekaputra said.
   ACeS's president, Adi R. Adiwoso, said that the loans will be used to
finance company projects, including the construction of Garuda
satellites and telecommunication networks.
   ACeS, set up in June 1995, is equally owned by PT Pasifik Satelit
Nusantara, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company and Jasmine
International Overseas Company of Thailand.
   By operating a satellite-based mobile communications system, ACeS
will facilitate the making and receiving of calls to and from places
within the spacecraft's coverage. Garuda satellites, manufactured by
Lockheed Martin Corporation of the United States, will allow subscribers
to call fixed telephone users anywhere in the world through its gateways
located in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.
   The cost for using the satellite service is estimated at $1 for one
minute of air traffic.
   Today, ACeS is scheduled to sign an agreement with Proton of Russia
on the launching of the first Garuda satellite in the middle of 1998.

Rukindo admits leakage

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The president of state-owned dredging company PT
Rukindo, Baharudin Wahab, said yesterday that his company has
experienced some "financial leakage."
   "Deviation and financial leakage did occur in our companies, but we
shouldn't necessarily relate them to corruption," he said at a hearing
with House Commission V for finance, trade, cooperatives and logistics.
   He did not give any overall figures, saying only that in the second
quarter of this year the company incurred Rp 7.8 billion (US$3.4
million) in "financial leakage" (unexpected expenses).
   Baharudin admitted that his company has been having efficiency
problems and has experienced setbacks due to delays in dredging projects
in west and east Ancol, North Jakarta, and in the Krakatau port of
Cilegon, West Java.
   The inefficiencies were partly caused by his employees, many of whom,
he said, lack professionalism.
   Baharudin also reported other problems that plagued his company's
performance during the second quarter, including equipment failures and
problems with its dredging ships.
   He said that his company expects to receive a loan of Rp 60 billion
for equipment and ship repair. "We're currently negotiating with a
number of financial institutions to get the loan," he said.
   He projected that his company would gain a profit of about Rp 3.5
billion this year. "At the least we hope to avoid incurring more losses
this year," he said. (13)

Inflation rate expected to hit 8.5% this year

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) expects
Indonesia's inflation rate to reach 8.5 percent this calender year and
8.9 percent next year.
   The agency attributed the high estimates to continued increases in
demand for consumer products.
   A BPS economic forecast for 1996 and 1997, made available yesterday,
said the projected rates are not expected to affect confidence in the
rupiah. Higher inflation is to come from increases in demand rather than
slower growth on the supply side, the report said.
   The government had planned to keep the inflation rate at 5 percent
per annum in the current five year development period, ending in 1999.
The target has yet to be achieved.
   The inflation rate, for example, was recorded at 8.65 percent in
1995, down slightly from 9.24 percent in the previous year. In the
January to July period of this year, the inflation rate was checked at
4.98 percent, down from 6.41 percent during the same period of last
year.
   According to BPS, government policies to fight inflation through
fiscal and monetary measures have not been effective due to growth in
short-term foreign funds through domestic equity and money markets.
   "The increase in the inflow of foreign funds through the capital and
money markets makes it difficult for the monetary authority to control
the money supply," the bureau said.

Investment decline

   It also reported an expected drop in the growth rate of foreign
investment approvals to 15 percent both in 1996 and 1997, from 25
percent last year.
   The projected declines in the value of foreign investment approvals
were attributed to inconsistencies in the government's microeconomic
policies. BPS did not elaborate.
   Foreign investment approvals, according to the Investment
Coordinating Board (BKPM), declined in value by 2.7 percent to $21
billion between January and July 15 this year from $27.2 billion in the
same period of last year. Meanwhile, the value of domestic investment
approvals rose 127 percent to Rp 70.6 trillion from Rp 31 trillion.
   In 1995, foreign investment approvals rose 68 percent to $39.9
billion from $23.7 billion in 1994, while domestic investment approvals
increased 30 percent to Rp 69.9 trillion from Rp 53.3 trillion.
   BPS said that slower foreign investment growth would result in a
decline in the aggregate growth of gross domestic capital to 7.67
percent in 1996 and 7.91 percent in 1997, compared to 8.4 percent in
1995.
   It said that slower growth in foreign investment approvals would also
slow domestic demand and the importation of consumer goods and services.
   The actual growth rate of imported goods and services is expected to
decline to 12 percent next year from 24 percent last year, BPS said.

Gajah Surya to buy a 51.8% share of BDNI

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The independent shareholders of PT Gajah Surya Multi
Finance, of the Gajah Tunggal Group, approved yesterday the company's
plan to acquire a 51.8 percent share of PT Bank Dagang Nasional
Indonesia (BDNI), together with four other proposals.
   The company said in a statement that all proposals, including those
for a rights issue and a change in its line of business, won unanimous
approval from approximately 80 percent of its independent shareholders
who attended yesterday's extraordinary meeting.
   The statement said that the planned acquisition will cost Rp 734
billion (US$313 million), representing a price of Rp 1,725 per share,
which will be financed by funds raised from the proposed rights issue.
   "The shareholders have also endorsed our plan to issue seven new
shares at Rp 1,300 each for every two old shares to raise total funds of
Rp 728 billion," it said.
   Gajah Surya shares yesterday closed at Rp 1,400 on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange and BDNI shares at Rp 1,675.
   The company said that after the acquisition it will become the Gajah
Tunggal Group's investment holding company under the name PT BDNI
Capital Corporation Tbk.
   "In line with the restructuring of our business line, we will hand
over all of our multifinance activities to PT Gajah Surya Finance and
we, therefore, increase our ownership from 86 percent at present to 98.8
percent."
   It was reported that Gajah Surya will increase its authorized capital

Indonesian horse riders lack basic skills: Expert

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 10

   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesian horse riders are among the best in Southeast
Asia, but surprisingly they lack basic skills, an international
equestrian expert said yesterday.
   Wolfgang Niggli, former chairman of the international equestrian
federation (FEI), the world equestrian body, told The Jakarta Post after
a three-day coaching clinic here that many Indonesian riders are not
familiar with basic training techniques.
   "I can see that a lot of basic training skills are still lacking.
Maybe the basics are not known well enough," he said.
   Of 12 riders invited to the clinic only five turned up; the others
returned home after the just-concluded 14th National Games last week.
   Niggli said, however, the riders have good prospects for success in
international events. "Look at Chiang Mai. If only the Indonesian riders
had had good horses, they would have won," he said.
   In the 1995 Southeast Asian Games in Chiang Mai, host Thailand
adopted a ruling saying that all participants had to use local horses.
Indonesia blamed the regulation for its failure to win gold medals in
both the individual and team dressage events. Indonesia had to be
content with a silver and a bronze.
   Niggli, who prefers to come here by himself instead of sending
somebody, said that the FEI issues passports for horses to enable them
travel around the world for competitions.
   "It is still difficult to do more because each country has its own
rules. We can't do much about it," he said.
   Thailand and Malaysia have just opened their borders to foreign
horses.
   Commenting on Indonesia's decision to exclude equestrian events from
the 25 proposed medal sports when it hosts the SEA Games next year,
Niggli said that the country will lose its biggest chance to win gold
medals.
   "It's a shame that the National Sports Council wants to drop
equestrian events based on medal-tally judging. It will also prevent the
sport's development here," he said.
   Wijaya, treasurer of the Jakarta Equestrian Association, told the
Post that despite the absence of equestrian events in the SEA Games, two
series of the Volvo World Cup will be staged here in September next
year.
   The first leg of the tournament will be held on Sept. 7 at the
Arthayasa Stable in Cinere, South Jakarta, which is owned by Radinal
Moochtar's son Rafiq Radinal. The second leg will be staged a week later
at the Ciater Stables in Sukabumi, West Java.
   The championships will feature dressage, jumping and three-day-event
competitions. (yan)

Games medal winners cash in on victories

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 10

   JAKARTA (JP): Cash bonuses for National Games winners made the
headlines in the country's sports pages over the weekend after 12 days
of hectic competition finished Friday.
   The size of the awards, a preferable substitute for traditional
floral garlands, varied from province to province, but there is no
denying that the vast majority of medal winners across the archipelago
are richer than they were before the Games.
   Central Java is the only province not rewarding its sporting heroes.
Governor Suwardi told his athletes arriving in Semarang Sunday that his
administration would not provide anything for the medalists.
   "As long as I am at the helm of this province, there will be no cash
bonuses for Central Java's athletes. For those who don't agree with my
policy I'll let you race to other provinces for cash," Suwardi was
quoted by Antara as saying,
   Leftovers from the province's Games budget are to be used to build
sports facilities, said the governor.
   Suwardi promised that rewards will be given in other forms, such as
jobs in provincial offices and direct admittance to state-run
universities.
   In Kendari, Governor La Ode Kaimoeddin handed out Rp 5 million
(US$2,146) to each of Southeast Sulawesi's 11 gold medalists, Rp 3
million to the four silver medalists and Rp 2 million to the nine
athletes who won bronzes during a ceremony yesterday attended by
Minister of Public Works Radinal Moochtar, who was there on an official
visit.
   The province finished 14th in the medal standings, three places lower
than three years ago. Nine of the golds in this year's Games came from
water sports.
   "Don't look at the amount, which may be less than that received by
athletes from other provinces. We have to thank this province's 1.4
million people who contributed to the bonuses," Kaimoeddin said.
   Jakarta's medal winners are enjoying the biggest bonuses, with each
gold medalist receiving three times the amount given to their Southeast
Sulawesi counterparts. A Jakartan silver medalist is Rp 7.5 million
richer, while the bronze medalists bagged Rp 4 million.
   Each member of a gold, silver and bronze medal-winning team received
Rp 7.5 million, Rp 5 million and Rp 2.5 million respectively. And
athletes who left the Games empty-handed were awarded consolation
bonuses of Rp 1 million.
   Record-breaking performances were also worth whopping bonuses, with a
Southeast Asian Games mark priced at Rp 5 million, a national record
worth Rp 3 million and a meet record going for Rp 2.5 million.
   "The amount of the bonuses is small compared to your efforts and I
don't think that you fought for glory because of the bonuses," Governor
Surjadi Soedirdja told his athletes during a get-together celebration on
Sunday.
   Jakarta was crowned the overall champion for a record eighth
successive time, scooping 141 golds, 83 silvers and 79 bronzes.
   West Javanese medal winners lived up to their status as runners-up to
Jakarta, emerging the second richest with Rp 12.5 million given to a
gold medalists, Rp 6.2 million to silver medalists and Rp 3.1 million to
bronze medalists.
   Central Kalimantan awarded Rp 6 million to its gold-medal winners, Rp
3 million to the silver medalists and Rp 1.5 million to the bronze
medalists. (amd)
