This image from the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite shows preliminary results of wave
height over the global ocean as measured by the Ku-band NASA altimeter. The
data were recorded from Sept. 25 to Oct. 4, 1992. The highest waves were observed
in the Southern Ocean south of South Africa and Australia, where gian waves as
high as eight meters (26 feet) were recorded. These waves are shown in red.
(The small pink square on the shoreline of Antarctica is a artifact of
processing.) The pattern of wave height is dependent upon the season. The highest
waves tend to occur in winter and the lowest waves in summer. The time of this
observation was during the transition of winter to spring in the Southern 
Hemisphere. Wave height is one of the oceanographic measurements made by the
TOPEX/Poseidon satellite. It is determined by the shape of the return radar pulse.
A calm sea with low waves returns a condensed pulse, and a rough sea with high
waves returns a stretched pulse. Calibration and validation of the altimeter
observation against ground truth measurements will be conducted over the next
few months. TOPEX/Poseidon, a joint U.S./French mission, is part of NASA's Earth
Science and Application Division. Launched Aug. 10, 1992, it is the second
satellite in the Mission to Planet Earth program, a long-term effort to study
Earth from space. <P>
