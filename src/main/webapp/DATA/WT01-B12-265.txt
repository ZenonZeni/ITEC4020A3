<BR>
Is it true? Can it be possible that inflation - the beast that once intimidated us all - has been tamed? Citing persistently low levels of inflation even during recent strong economic growth, many economists including Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. Chief Economist John Silvia believe that the Federal Reserve Board has largely succeeded in controlling inflation. If it's true that the lion will roar no more (or at least for the foreseeable future), there may be some issues that you need to rethink.

At its highest in the last 45 years, consumer price inflation was 14.6 percent in March 1980. You would have needed almost 15 percent just to have forward motion in either the return on your investments or in a salary increase. Now, with inflation averaging about 3.5 percent in the last five years, you don't need double-digits to make the kind of progress that you did during high inflation periods. True, the numbers are punier, but low inflation may mean that you can keep more of what you earn.

And that may be just about it. Residential real estate's ability to keep up with what was then the high rate of inflation in the 1970s and 1980s provided many homeowners with a nest egg they could live in. But the absence of inflation in today's environment begs the question: If housing keeps pace with inflation and inflation has been de-fanged to about 3 percent, how will tomorrow's nest eggs be built? According to Silvia, many Americans are substituting financial assets for real estate assets as their prime way of building net worth. Rather than being counseled to stretch themselves to buy a home today, younger Americans are now being urged to invest.

But savvy shoppers are learning to postpone their buying as long as they can. That's a departure from the 1970s and 1980s when Americans bought as soon as they could rather than run the risk of paying higher prices later. Silvia says the low inflation environment has made it possible for discounters like Wal-Mart and Home Depot to exist. "You have to have stable prices in order for someone to come in and make a business out of discounting those prices," he says.

<BR>
Borrowing makes some sense when you can borrow today and pay your creditor with dollars that will be worth less tomorrow. That's not true in 1996, especially if your borrowing takes the form of charging to a 19.8 percent credit card account at a time when inflation is averaging 3 percent. You're providing your lender with a very high, very real return of approximately 16.8 percent.

<BR>
While it may seem to be under control for now, inflation continues to represent a risk for investors. Even if the U.S. economy continued in its current 3 percent inflation bliss for the next 20 years, the purchasing power of $1 would be reduced to 55 cents by 2016. That's why investment experts continue to recommend investments that have historically outpaced inflation.
