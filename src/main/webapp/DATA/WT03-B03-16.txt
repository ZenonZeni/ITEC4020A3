CHINA-TOURISM: Shanghai Welcomes First Theme Park

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Chinese tourists will be able to feel and act like a cowboy in
the wild, wooly west, stare down a bad guy in a "gun fight,"
explore an old haunted castle, play with life-sized cartoon
figures, or race along in thrilling high-speed chases. They can
even roam on ``Miami beaches.'' And that's just a taste of the
playful fun awaiting visitors to the first US Dream Park in
China.

Newly opened in August, the US Dream Park in Huangdu, Jiading,
will provide tourists with outstanding, and colorful amusement.
This park fills the gap in China's amusement trade and will
further brighten up Shanghai's tourist industry. Covering an area

districts. One makes world famous films come to life. With one
ticket, tourists can experience China's largest scale thrilling
recreations, as well as film stunts, music, dance, magic and
sports.

October, others in Chengdu, Beijing and Wuhan are in the planning
stage.

CHINA-TOURISM: News in Brief: --Ancient Bells Chime for Museum Visitors

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

--Ancient Bells Chime for Museum Visitors.  The Han Dynasty
Emperor Wudi Maoling Museum has recently added an Ancient Bell
Exhibition and Concert Hall to perform Chinese music dating more
than 2,400 years.

The Maoling Museum, 40 km northwest of Xian, is famous at home
and abroad for a number of large Han Dynasty stone inscriptions.
In the concert hall, a set of 64 bronze chime of bells are
exhibited. A chime of bells is a set of bells whose tones span
one octave. Simple and unsophisticated in shape and fine in
workmanship, they hang from bronze frames in three layers and
eight groups. The original pieces were discovered in Zeng Houyi's
tomb of the early Warring States Period (475-221 BC) in Suizhou,
Hubei Province in 1978. Although they sat underground for more
than 2,400 years, they still have a wide range of sounds and can
play ancient and modern music. This collection is the oldest
large musical instrument with 12 and chromatic scales in the
world.

--The Japanese-Chinese Friends Association Silk Road Exploration
Commenced on August 2: The 26-member group traversed over 6,000
km by car to Lanzhou, Jiayuguan Pass, Dunhuang, Urumqi, Kashi,
ancient city of Miran and Xining, and will return to Xian after
28 days.

CHINA-TOURISM: New Xian-Lhasa Airline

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Upon approval from the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), Southwest Airlines opened the Xian-Lhasa Airline on July
1, this year, completing an air bridge from northwest China to
the roof of the world.

The Xian-Lhasa Airline links Kathmandu's International Airline
with a return flight stopping in Xian and continuing to Beijing,
an air distance of 1,900 km, flying 2 hours and 40 minutes by
Boeing 757 each Monday and Thursday. People in tourist circles
estimate the opening of the new airline will link the capital,
Beijing, with the ancient cities of Xian, Lhasa and Kathmandu.

Since the first successful flight from Sichuan's Chengdu to Lhasa
in 1956, the CAAC has opened Sichuan's Chongqing, Beijing to
Lhasa and Chengdu to Tibet's Qamdo air routes, which have safely
flown over the plateau for 40 years. The opening of the Xian-
Lhasa Airline will further improve the air transportation network
in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

CHINA-TOURISM: Giant Reclining Buddha at Wutai Mountain: During the 7th
Wutai Mountains International Tourist Month...

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

During the 7th Wutai Mountains International Tourist Month,
tourists will be see a new sight--a 1,000-meter-long reclining
Buddha.

The giant Buddha reclines with his head lying in the Puhua Temple
and his feet in the Nanshan Temple. The 3,000-meter-meandering
Qingshui River passing his body is a grand Wutai Mt. spectacle.
Just before sunrise is the best time to see the sleeping Buddha,
when the silhouette of the 1,000-meter-long sleeping Buddha is
clearly visible in the sun's first bright rays.

This giant Buddha has been a legend for many years, the subject
of stories and fascination, but its existence was not verified
until recently. In 1995, the Buddha was finally discovered by
some artists from the Taiyuan Art Academy in Shanxi Province.
Climbing the Wutai Mt. during several different seasons and times
of day, one morning they at last discovered the 1,000-meter-long
sleeping Buddha, observing it in the first rays of the morning
sun from the upper floor of a government office building in the
Wutai Mountains Scenic Spot.

A terrace especially for viewing the Buddha will be built in the
Wutai Mountain Scenic Spot.

CHINA-TOURISM: Hebei's Special Itineraries

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

CHEN ZHONGLIE

To kick off the Visit China '97 promotion, Hebei Province, with
its original Great Wall Tour, Fitness Tour, and Acrobatics and
Marshal Arts Tours, will again offer another four special
itineraries.

Forest Grassland Tour. North Hebei Province has a verdant expanse
of grassland and a vast sea of forest. The interesting grassland
tents, wooden houses, unique barbecue and special milk tea,
horse-riding, shooting and particularly the grand evening
bonfires and unique Manchu and Mongolian song and dance evening
parties make this tour an explosion of ethnic and cultural
adventure.

Bird-Watching Tour. The Beidaihe coast has attracted migratory
birds for centuries. In addition to wildlife splendor, visitors
can enjoy luxuriant forests, splendid grasslands, and long
stretches of beaches and marshes--a bird's paradise. According to
studies, in Beidaihe and its environs, 405 kinds of birds have
been logged, 68 of which are under state protection. Red-crowned
cranes, large swans, white storks, goshawks, sea vultures,
sparrow hawks and other rare birds can be observed here. The best
times for bird-watching in Beidaihe are April to May and October
to December.

Buddhist Temple Tour. Shijiazhuang, capital city of Hebei
Province, occupies an important position in the history of
Buddhism. As early as the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the Chan Sect
of Buddhism was flourishing, and the Linji, Longxing, Bailin,
Diyin, Pilu and another 17 temples are well known at home and
abroad. The Linji Temple was the birthplace of the Linji Chan
Sect. The Linji Chan style, initiated by Master Yixuan, is
practiced widely in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Southeast
Asian countries. The Bailin Temple is the oldest site for
ceremonial rites to worship the Goddess of Mercy. According to
historic documents, the Tang Dynasty eminent monk Xuan Zang
lectured in the Bailin and Diyin temples and then went
pilgrimaging to the west. The annual Grand Buddhist Doctrine
Summon at Diyin Temple attract numerous Chinese and foreign
Buddhists and tourists.

The Three Kingdoms Cultural Tour. Zhuozhou in Hebei Province is
the birthplace of the Three Kingdoms culture. The famous historic
work, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, was originated from
here. The Lousang Temple, native home of Liu Bei (king of the Shu
State), the Zhongyi Temple, home of Zhang Fei (a Shu State
general), the Zhang Fei Well, the Sanyi Temple where Liu Bei,
Guan Yu (also a Shu State general) and Zhang Fei became sworn
brothers in the Peach Garden, and other ancient historic remains
have been renovated. The Zhuozhou Film and TV City, built for
shooting the grand TV serial The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,
covers an area of 146.7 hectares. It encompasses the Han Dynasty
Imperial Scenic Spot, and four folk residential complexes named
as the Bamboo Garden, the Peach Garden, the Plum Garden and the
Pear Garden. The Bronze Sparrow Terrace, a magnificent
architectural structure in the State of Wei (220-265), is
acclaimed by many as the epitome of perfection.

CHINA-PRESS: Annual Salary System Introduced: ''Zhongguo Qingnian
Bao''

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

(China Youth Daily)

The annual base salary-plus system, which is common abroad,
began to be trial practiced by the Shanghai Fountain Pen Factory
four years ago.

Clearly defined property right relationship and coordinated
reforms provided the precondition for instituting this system.

The system enables appointed officials of state-owned
enterprises to become professional entrepreneurs.

This year, 20 of the 140 pilot enterprises practicing the modern
enterprise system have introduced  the new salary system.

The base annual salaries for directors and managers, ranging
between 20,000 to 50,000 yuan, are determined in accordance with
the size of each enterprise's net assets. Salary supplements, or
what is sometimes known as risk incomes, are determined according
to management achievements, including the growth rate of assets
and profits, with the ceiling level tripling the base salary.

For example, regardless of level of achievements in business
operations, the maximum salary ceiling for the director of a
large enterprise will not exceed 200,000 yuan. This sum is
reasonable under China's current conditions. Introduction of the
base salary-plus system not only inspires enterprise directors
and managers to work harder and restricts abuses of power, but
also takes into account the interest of employees.

Implementing the base salary-plus system in state-owned
enterprises will pave the way for forming an orderly professional
entrepreneur market.

CHINA-PRESS: Changes in Employment Structure

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

YANGZI WANBAO

(Yangtze Evening News)

With the acceleration of reform in China's labor system and the
improvement of labor markets, changes have also occurred in
employment structures.

First, a two-way migration work patterns is taking shape. A
growing number of urbanities now seek jobs in rural areas. Among
the country's 130 million employed by township enterprises, 10
percent are urbanities. For example, many urban skilled workers
in southern Jiangsu Province prefer township enterprises where
they can gain higher incomes and have greater life choices. In
some township enterprises, one-third of workers come from cities.
Even university graduates and qualified technicians prefer to
work at township enterprises. For example, a continuous stream of
university graduates come to the Hongdou Group for employment.
The 6,000-employee firm, located in suburban Wuxi City, Jiangsu
Province, now employs more than 600 university graduates.

Second, the number of employees in the private and individual
businesses has increased rapidly. By the end of 1995 the number
had reached 19.6 million, accounting for more than 10 percent of
the country's total employees.

Third, the number of government employees declined, with the
1995 figure dropping by 210,000 from 1994.

CHINA-PRESS: Skill Training on the Rise

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

GONGREN RIBAO

Workers' Daily

At present, skill training is gaining popularity throughout
China, following the drive to enhance university degrees and
doing business.

The training is oriented to diversified skills beyond the
learners' own professions. Numerous training classes,
continuation classes and advanced classes have been opened in
many cities, where the employed, unemployed or off-job workers
learn driving, accounting, cooking, tailoring and  foreign
languages.

More than 3 million people are registered to receive various
kinds of adult education and training annually in Beijing.
Approximately 30 million persons nationwide have received their
driver's license through training. The Nanjing Vocational
Training Center reports that 91 percent of their students hold
full-time jobs.

This rush toward continuing education is a direct result of the
development of a market economy. If

workers hope to stay competitive and get better jobs, they must
update their skills regularly. The grim situation in China's
labor market requires people to learn what the market needs and
conscientiously seek more skills for their future development.

CHINA-PRESS: Lecture on Peking Opera Makeup

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

RENMIN RIBAO

(People's Daily, Overseas Edition)

This May, Famous Peking Opera makeup master Yan Shaokui lectured
at length on makeup techniques for the famous Peking Opera to a
fascinated group of students from Europe, America, Asia and
Africa. Sponsored by Nanjing University's Department of Foreign
Students, the lecture included a display of hundreds of lively,
colorful Peking Opera makeups made of paper, clay or fiberglass-
reinforced plastic. Makeups ranged in size from one or two meters
to about 10 cm.

Yan introduced to the several dozen foreign students the
development and significance of the cosmetic makeups in the
evolution of the Peking Opera, the relationship between makeups
and Peking Opera, and some basic techniques for drawing. To
demonstrate, Yan applied a black makeup to his face and performed
a related role from the opera highlight.

In response to requests of audience, Yan painted some of their
faces as well. He deftly transformed Nina from Sweden into the
Monkey King after 20 minutes of magic. While doing varied makeups
for five additional women from the Republic of Korea, Japan and
Indonesia, Yan explained various dramatic allusions, the use of
color and drawing skills, which was thoroughly impressed the
audience.

It was a special treat for foreign students to learn from a
master in Peking Opera makeup. They found the makeups vivid and
charming and looked forward to learning more about Peking Opera.
Women whom Yan had made up left their new faces on a second day
to show off the makeups to their friends. They took numerous
photos as a memento of this quintessentially Beijing art form.

CHINA: Libraries Adapt to New Demands

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Feng Jing

The excited librarians at the Shanghai Library ignored
this summer's sultry hot weather and busily packed the many books
shelved in the 40-year-old structure for shipment to a new
library complex.

The new library, which covers 3.1 hectares on Huaihai
Road in downtown Shanghai, has a total floor space of 83,000
square meters capable of shelving more than 13 million volumes.

The library's two main buildings--a 55.6-meter-high
structure and a 106-meter-high tower building--symbolize the
accumulation of human culture and pursuit of knowledge. The
compound is landscaped with lawns, flower beds, fountains and two
squares.

The library, scheduled for a limited opening by the end
of this year, offers 5,000 seats in 20-odd reading rooms
featuring books, periodicals, and audio-visual and electronic
packages catalogued in terms of differing disciplines. The
facility's expansive book lending center offers wide-ranging
works published during the last five-eight years.

The library is equipped with computer and
telecommunications technology for the management of purchasing,
cataloguing, circulation, public inquiries and lending systems.
It will also introduce a CD-ROM system and various specialized
databases for items such as classical and rare books and
contemporary photo archives. In addition, the complex will be
equipped with various audio-visual systems, facilities for the
production of audio-visual materials, cataloging and monitoring
systems, and satellite  dishes.

Deputy Director Wu Jianzhong noted that constantly
expanding public access to information requires libraries to
alter the previous practice of stressing book collections, and
instead place priority on improving services for readers. "We
will shift the focus of work from simply collecting books to
upgrading services,'' said Wu.

Library Expansion

Statistics show that the country had 392 scattered
libraries in large cities at the founding of New China in 1949.

By 1994, however, the number had soared to 258,477, with
more than 400,000 employees, housing collections of over 3
billion volumes. They facilities included 2,596 public libraries
above the county level, 1,080 university and college libraries,
more than 8,000 large and medium-sized libraries serving various
scientific research institutes, and a substantial number of
children's libraries and various libraries attached to trade
unions, primary and secondary schools, Party schools and army
units.

Since the 1980s, numerous library buildings featuring
diversified architectural styles have mushroomed in various
localities, with a new facility opening every couple of days.

The new library for the China National Museum, located in
the western suburbs of Beijing, is the pride of Chinese citizens.
The modern facility, which opened in 1987, is the largest library
in Asia and one of the top five libraries in the world, with its
design offering unique national flavor. The complex, with a total
floor space of 140,000 square meters, currently houses 16.7
million volumes, including 280,000 rare books from the
collections of imperial families in various dynasties and famous
private collections.

The Tibet Autonomous Region now has 50 libraries at
various levels. The first public library in the region was built
by the 18th Army Group of the People's Liberation Army in the
early 1950s. Soldiers led yak carrying gunnysacks full of books
to fill the shelves of the facility.

The new Tibet Library, the largest of its type in the
region, opened on July 1 this year. The modern multipurpose
library, which sits at the highest elevation compared to any
library in the world, mainly collects books and materials on
Tibetan studies, and will gradually be transformed into a major
center offering materials to Tibetanologists both at home and
abroad, and a major venue for comprehensive public education.

China currently has 427 libraries in minority nationality
areas.

New Technology

Many of the libraries have introduced new technology
such as computers, microfilm, xerox, audio-visual equipment, CDs,
automatic transmission and fire- and theft-resistant facilities.

Computer technology, the nucleus of modern technology, is
gaining increasing popularity. According to a 1995 study of 3,139
public, university and scientific research institute libraries
nationwide, subject facilities were equipped with 6,521
computers, 2,296 terminals, 1,076 databases for different
categories of information, 3,113 photo copy machines and 1.93
million audio-visual packages.

The National Library in Beijing, Zhongshan Library in
Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen Library are engaged in an
extensive effort to developing software and databases. Notable
progress has also been made in establishing a network linked to
the Zhongguancun Library in Beijing, a Beijing-Shanghai-Wuhan
computer network linking libraries of all institutes under the
China Academy of Sciences in the three localities, and a
satellite network for libraries attached to the People's
Liberation Army.

The National Library, the Beijing Eastern District
Library and various other libraries currently have reading rooms
offering electronic publications. China's first public computer
library--the Zhongnan Computer Library in Guangzhou City--opened
early last year. The facility which occupies 250 square meters in
the Guangzhou Library is equipped with computer operations and
software rooms, computer publications reading rooms, computer
sales halls, and expert reception rooms. The library offers
readers access to more than 100 computers and 200,000 sets of
software free of charge.

Capital Shortages

The public library in the bustling and hot city of
Shenzhen provides residents with a quiet and cool place to relax.
The current situation, however, is much different from only a few
years ago when capital shortages prevented the facility from
installing air-conditioners. A leading local government official
decreed that the library should be air conditioned prior to
occupation of the municipal government office building.

China's library system has developed despite the fact
that financial strain has hindered both construction and
operations. Capital shortages have led to the overuse of numerous
facilities, including the National Library in Beijing. In
addition, constant price hikes for publications in recent years
have resulted in a decline in the availability of new books and
periodicals in most public libraries. Du Ke, director of the
Library Division of the Ministry of Culture, noted that
government capital appropriations to public libraries have, in
fact, increased constantly, with annual funding soaring from less
than 60 million yuan in the 1980s to over 740 million yuan in
1995, a rate far exceeding that for national economic growth and
increases in financial revenue. Nonetheless, the admirable effort
has been unable to fully facilitate the developmental needs of
libraries.

Serving Economic Development

Qu Jiankang, director of the Shaanxian County Library in
Henan Province, was somewhat surprised at a meeting when a farmer
popped in to present him with over a dozen carp. The farmer
thanked Qu profusely, saying that the books Qu had sent on fish
breeding techniques and methods for treating aquatic diseases had
prevented him from losing as much as 100,000 yuan.

"Providing services to spur economic development is one
of our major tasks,'' said Qu. According to statistics for recent
years, despite being handicapped by limited operational funds of
only 280,000 yuan, the Shaanxian Library has provided various
sectors in the county with information and materials which have
helped to create over 6 million yuan in output value. Upon
learning that the county's chemical fertilizer plant planned to
launch an art paper manufacturing project, Qu invited the
factory's technology director to the library and provided him
with all related books and materials. The materials helped the
factory to quickly formulate construction and production plans
for the new facility and in turn saved 450,000 yuan in
construction funds alone.

In recent years, libraries at different levels in various
localities have provided materials and information for major
state and local construction projects, and in so  doing have
played an extremely important role in the country's economic
development. The National Library has contributed information and
materials to key projects involving mineral exploration, water
conservancy, metallurgy and geology. The Shanghai Library
provided invaluable assistance to the Huangpu River tunnel
project. The Gansu Provincial Library provided assistance to
construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Urumqi and Baotou-
Lanzhou railways, as well as to survey and design projects for
the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station. The Henan Provincial Library
joined in the Yellow River treatment project and the Hangzhou
Library participated in the cross-channel dike project for the
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The Library of the China Academy of
Sciences has provided voluminous materials concerning the
ecological and environmental impact of the Three Gorges Project
on the Yangtze River. Services provided by the libraries have
helped to solve many technical problems, improve design, expedite
the progress of related projects and save construction funds.

Since 1986, libraries nationwide have worked in
cooperation with responsible departments to promote the Spark
Program, a major project the State Science and Technology
Commission introduced to expedite the industrialization and
commercialization of the results of scientific and technological
research. The goal of the program is to accelerate local economic
development. Some 70 libraries in Hunan Province have provided
more than 200 local Spark projects with follow-up services,
including 85 key projects. The libraries have compiled and
printed more than 40 scientific and technological information
pamphlets and 150 catalogs for specialized publications. In
addition, they have sponsored 250 practical technology training
courses which have attracted over 12,500 people.

Special Services

Many libraries now offer special services, with Beijing
libraries in particular recording notable progress in related
activities.

A 1986 survey conducted by the East District Library
revealed that the 25 clothing manufacturing factories in the
district accounting for the majority of both the total output
value and number of employees were in urgent need of adapting
themselves to rapid changes in the clothing market. The library
immediately formed a clothing information group. To facilitate
constantly increasing demand, in 1990 the library established the
clothing information section with a collection of several
thousand books and periodicals, and scores of video tapes on
fashion industries from more than a dozen countries and regions,
including the United States, France, Japan, Switzerland and
Italy. The information section, now known as the capital's
clothing information center, has introduced reading rooms which
attract numerous garment designers and manufacturers.

The West District Library, located in an area with
abundant cultural relics and tourism resources, has established a
tourism materials section which categorizes existing books,
periodicals and materials into tourism trends, scenic wonders in
China, scenic sites and folklore in Beijing, and special services
in the Chinese capital. It has also established cooperative
relations with the Lushan Library in Jiangxi Province, AT&T
(China) Co., and various travel services, with the effort
dedicated to arranging exchanges and sharing tourism information.
Last year, the section served more than 20,000 readers, or 40
percent of the library's total number of visitors. The section
lent more than 90,000 books and periodicals, with the figure
accounting for over 90 percent of the library's total circulation
volume.

In recent years, the Decorative Art Materials Section of
the Haidian District Library has attracted a growing number of
people engaged in arts and crafts, decoration and advertisement
design, and general readers with a strong affinity for the arts.

The Chongwen District Library offers a wide-ranging
collection of books on architecture, while the Xuanwu District
Library is known for its collections of books and materials on
folklore and packaging. The Capital Library is currently
accelerating formation of the Beijing Local Documents Database.

The past closed management style of Chinese libraries was
characterized by each facility pursuing the accumulation of large
quantities of materials and complete volumes of documents. The
approach resulted in duplicated collections and prevented the
full use of limited funds. Experts contend that the current
practice centering on each facility pursuing its own advantages
provides basic material conditions for the establishment of
cooperation networks which will promote share and inter-library
lending. The formation of said networks will also help
rationalize the use of funds.

Knowledge Pool

Two-year-old Yangyang frequently visits her grandparents
on weekends, with her parents seizing the opportunity to visit
the local library.

In recent years, the couple, university graduates who
respectively earned degrees in oceanography and chemistry in the
late 1980s, have regularly visited the local library on Sundays
to update their knowledge and information.

Along with the rapid development of the market economy
and the increasingly fierce competition in the job and
information markets, many people, particularly those in rapidly
growing localities, opt to supplement their knowledge with
information provided by libraries.

The Shenzhen Library's annual practice of issuing new
book cards represents a special occasion in the city. As many as
10,000 people often queue in front of the library from dawn to
dusk, with some even coming on the previous night. According to
statistics, the Shenzhen Library now serves 5,400 readers daily.

Rural township libraries have mushroomed in southern
Jiangsu Province since 1990, with more than 430 townships in
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou cities opening facilities by 1994.

Each library in the 35 townships in Wuxi County, Wuxi
City, have collections exceeding 10,000 volumes. The libraries,
which have a total of 600,000 volumes, serve 1.2 million rural
readers annually, with their combined circulation surpassing 2
million volumes.

Rural families in southern Jiangsu traditionally hold a
family feast on the evening of the Winter Solstice. On last
year's Winter Solstice, however, many residents of Luoshe Town,
Wuxi County, visited the local library after dinner, filling the
300-square-meter reading room. The visitors refused to leave
despite a power outage. Librarians proceeded to light candles,
and the over 100 avid readers, ignoring the dim light, continued
reading until closing time.

CHINA: High-Tech: A Hope for China's Agriculture

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Zhou Xin

Can China solve its agricultural problems? Practice of the Sino-
Israeli Demonstration Farm offers a positive answer. By relying
on advanced agrotechnology, China will create a new miracle in
agricultural production.

The Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm (SIDF), which is located in
the southeastern suburbs of Beijing, has attracted worldwide
attention since its establishment two years ago. No visitor from
any part of the country hesitates to express admiration for the
high yields brought about by high technology.

The four large white greenhouses, the most eye-catching
structures in the farm, are totally controlled by computers, in
which high-yield and quality crops introduced from Israel are
planted. According to Zhu Hongfeng, head of the farm, the
greenhouses, which were imported from Israel, are fairly
advanced. The two insulating layers on the ceilings keep the
greenhouses warm in winter, and protect plants from the scorching
sun and lower the temperature in summer. These devices can be
moved automatically to ensure the necessary temperature for
different stages of vegetable growth.

The trickle irrigation system, a symbol of Israel's high
agrotechnology, crisscrosses the farm's 75-hectare field. This
water-efficient system ensures the crops  fully absorb moisture
and fertilizer.

Israel and China face common problems in agriculture, namely
infertile land, drought and water shortage. However, the former
has solved its problems by applying high technology.

Chinese agronomists hold that the advanced agrotechnology
displayed by the farm is highly suitable for China, especially
for the arid and water-deficient inland areas in northwest
regions, such as Gansu and Ningxia which were widely considered
as places unworthy of agricultural development.

A bare fact may well explain why Chinese farmers show such a
great interest in Israel's irrigation system. The system enables
the SIDF to create several firsts in vegetable production. For
example, the quarterly output of tomatoes has reached 5,500 kg
per mu (1 mu equals 1/15 hectare), three-four times that produced
by individual farmer households. Green pepper's output hits
15,000 kg per mu, with one pepper weighing 700-800 grams.

The key to the success of the farm lies in the country's longing
for agricultural modernization. In many parts of China, farmers
still sow seeds manually and plough their fields with the aid of
ox. The backward farming techniques lead to low yields and
vulnerability of grain production to natural disasters, typically
annual flood in the south and drought spells in the north.

Due to the underdevelopment of agriculture, China has long been
obsessed by the grain issue and the question of how to fulfill
the growing demand for quality farm produce following the
constant increase of incomes. In addition, the low income from
farming has driven numerous farmers to cities, resulting in the
short supply of raw materials for industrial production, a major
factor restricting the development of the national economy.

Early this year, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
reported that China lags behind Western countries by 15-20 years
in terms of the comprehensive level of agricultural science and
technology. The per-unit yield of many crops is lower than the
average international level. To narrow this gap, China has
introduced from other countries more than 1,000 advanced
agrotechnologies during the past five years. Prior to the year
2000, the country plans to invest US$500 million for importing
another 1,000 advanced, applicable agrotechnologies.

Some people have asked whether the SIDF mode can be popularized
throughout the country. Undoubtedly, fine quality farm produce
would bring about generous profits. However, if unable to be
universalized, such high-tech agriculture featuring high input,
high output and high profits still faces an unpredictable market
in China.

According to Zhu, as the supply of his farm's products currently
falls short of demand, Beijing citizens can hardly get them on
the market. In fact, the farm's products are mostly bought by
luxury hotels because their price is four-five times that of
ordinary vegetables on Beijing market.

The SIDF is now trying to lower cost by combining imported
technology with local farmers' traditional practices. For
instance, the farm has built brick greenhouses and equipped them
with Israeli trickle irrigation and computer control systems.
Saving expenses for importing specially made greenhouses has
enabled the farm to cut the per-mu production cost by several
thousand yuan.

Zhu said that the per-capita productivity of his 170-staff farm
has attained a fairly high level and annually earns a net income
of 50,000 yuan from one mu of vegetable. "If the production scale
further expands, costs will drop further,'' assured an official
from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Expansion of the use of high technology is essential for China to
realize agricultural modernization and intensification. China is
cooperating with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and
other international institutions to explore effective ways for
spreading high agrotechnologies. The SIDF has become a base in
this regard. In spring this year, the farm began to host on-site
training courses for farmers from all over the country. The
farmers were taught the skills to grow the varieties bred by the
farm.

China plans to increase the contributory rate of science and
technology to agriculture from 35 percent to 50 percent by the
end of this century, and gives priority to importing applicable
advanced technology to enable more Chinese farmers to directly
benefit from agrotechnology.

Modern agrotechniques have not only enabled Chinese farmers to
gain direct economic results, but also provided foreign business
people with an opportunity to enter Chinese agricultural market.

Officials of the Israeli embassy in China assess the beneficial
results of the SIDF every month, and recently revealed the plan
of establishing two similar farms in other parts of the country.
An official of Chinese Ministry of Agriculture noted that the
SIDF has produced an advertising effect.

Li Hongyi, head of a Shandong farm, expressed willingness to buy
equipment and seeds as those used by the SIDF. He even intended
to employ one or two Israeli agronomists.

The SIDF, called by the Chinese as a "modernized agricultural
factory'', opens up a bright prospect for China's agriculture. An
economist noted that the time has come for China to create the
second miracle in agriculture by relying on high technology.

The first miracle emerged in the early 1980s following the
abolishment of the people's commune system and introduction of
the system of contracted responsibility for tilling the land. The
farmers' enthusiasm was greatly aroused, and in turn the
country's grain output increased by 80 billion kg in the
subsequent nine years. The effort is commonly regarded as a
system revolution, and now China is envisaging a technological
revolution.

CHINA: Chinese Foreign Ministry News Briefings

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Spokesman Shen Guofang.PI DAWEI

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters
attending last week's regularly scheduled news briefings that
Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Sheikh
Hasina will pay an official visit to China between September 12-
16, 1996, at the invitation of Premier Li Peng.

Shen then opened the floor for questions.

Q: Would you comment on the two missile attacks the US military
delivered against Iraq?

A: We deeply regret and are strongly dissatisfied with the fact
that the United States attacked Iraq with missiles, causing
casualties and property damages. The use of force against a
sovereign country not only represents a serious violation of
international norms, but also heightens the already tense
situation in the region and creates the possibility for serious
adverse effects. The Chinese government reiterates that Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected. We
sincerely hope that all parties concerned will immediately cease
military operations to relieve the tense situation in the region,
and will in turn reach a just and reasonable resolution to
problems lingering from the Gulf War through political dialogue
and on the basis of relevant UN resolutions.

Q: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat held their first summit on September 4.
How does China view the meeting?

A: China supports all steps leading to the realization of a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We believe the summit
between the two leaders will help Israel and Palestine establish
mutual trust and resume peace talks at the earliest possible
date. We sincerely hope that all parties concerned will observe
previous agreements in order to remove all remaining obstacles to
push forward the peace process under the principle of "land for
peace."

Q: The People's Liberation Army Daily recently carried an article
entitled "Losing 1,000 Ounce of Gold is Preferable to Losing One
Inch of Land." Does this mean the Chinese government will assume
an uncompromising attitude on the issue of the Diaoyu Islands at
the risk of losing 400 billion Japanese yen in loans?

A: The issue of Japanese loans is a totally different matter from
safeguarding China's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Japanese loans to China will benefit bilateral trade and economic
cooperation. Nonetheless, the Chinese government offers no room
for compromise and will take whatever action is necessary to
safeguard China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We duly
note that China and Japan have disputed control of the Diaoyu
Islands. Therefore, we propose that both sides shelve
disagreements and jointly develop resources in the islands.
Neither side should resort to any action which will heighten
tensions concerning the situation.

Q: According to recent reports, the Dalai Lama is scheduled to
visit Australia. What is China's position?

A: We believe the Dalai Lama is not only a religious figure, but
more importantly a political figure in exile. Therefore, we
maintain that any country maintaining normal diplomatic relations
with China should not host visits by the aforementioned political
figure. We also believe that any country maintaining normal
diplomatic relations with China is blatantly interfering in
China's internal affairs by hosting the Dalai Lama.

Q: According to recent reports, Taiwan's Li Teng-hui informed
Australian reporters that he would like to visit Australia. How
would a visit by Li affect Sino-Australian relations?

A: China and Australia currently maintain normal diplomatic
relations, with political, trade and economic ties developing
rapidly in recent years. Therefore,  Australia should refrain
from meddling in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan issue. We
sincerely hope that Australia will honor its commitments in
accordance with the joint communique for the establishment of
Sino-Australian diplomatic ties by refraining from developing
official relations with Taiwan. Any other course will seriously
affect Sino-Australian relations.

Q: German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will meet Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen at the end of September in New York. He also
hopes to visit China in October to pave the way for a November
visit by the German president. Does this indicate the
normalization of Sino-German relations?

A: China attaches great importance to developing relations with
Germany, with economic and political ties expanding rapidly in
recent years. However, various factors earlier this year created
a strain in Sino-German relations. We hope the meeting between
the German foreign minister and Qian Qichen will be successful
and will in turn return Sino-German relations to a course of
sound development.

CHINA: The world has reason to watch for whither Japan is heading Japan:
Don't Do Anything Foolish

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by People's Daily Commentator

In the last few weeks Japan has carried out a series of
provocative actions over the Chinese territory, Diaoyu Islands,
situated between Taiwan and southern Japan.

On July 14, the right-wing Japanese Youth Foundation built a
lighthouse on Diaoyu Island, the main island of the islets, and
the Japanese government announced an exclusive economic zone of
200 nautical miles on July 20, taking in the Chinese islands.

Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda then openly claimed that
the Diaoyu Islands belong to Japan and that there is no need to
justify this claim.

On August 18, a right-wing group from Japan's southern Okinawa-
ken put up a board on one of the islands with a drawing of the
Japanese flag.

There are reports that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
ordered the military to prepare for any contingency and that the
Japanese authorities even went so far as to threaten force if
necessary.

The Chinese people will not stand by violation of their
territorial integrity. The Diaoyu Islands, like Taiwan, are an
inalienable and indisputable part of China since ancient times.

Evidence dating back as early as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),
when Chinese fishermen conducted activities in this area, prove
the islands are part of China.

Japan seized Taiwan and its surrounding islands, including the
Diaoyu Islands, during the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895. In
April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to sign
the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and ceded the islands to Japan.

After World War II, a defeated Japan returned Taiwan to China,
but privately handed the Diaoyu Islands over to the United
States. In 1971, the US government illegally returned the Diaoyu
Islands to Japan, an action the Chinese government strongly
opposed.

When Japan and China normalized relations in 1972 and signed the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978, the two
countries, taking overall relations into account, agreed to
settle the issue of the Diaoyu Islands in the future.

Japan, however, broke its promise and has intensified its efforts
to create instability and stir up trouble. Japan tried to
strengthen the symbolic significance of its occupation of the
Diaoyu Island by playing the shameless card of "if I have
occupation, I have possession."

It is well known that in international relationships, the issue
of ownership of territory is the most crucial. Japan has upset
this sensitive balance many times recently and evidently wants to
take advantage of the changes in the political situation in East
Asia since the end of the Cold War to demonstrate its power to
the outside world and to test China's determination to safeguard
its territory and sovereignty.

China has always handled the issue holistically and cherishes
friendly relations with Japan. China's stand on the Diaoyu
Islands is to put aside their dispute and jointly exploit the
region on the precondition that China has sovereignty.

Over that past 100 years, the Chinese people have never kow-towed
to foreign powers. They won back the independence and sovereignty
of the country with the blood and lives of millions of people.

Today, if anyone thinks China's 1.2 billion people will surrender
even one inch of soil, they are indulging in fantasy; if anyone
holds the illusion that the Chinese people will yield to foreign
forces, they are day dreaming; if anybody wants to take advantage
of the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits,
they are making a grave mistake. The Chinese people are united
and adamant about maintaining their territorial integrity.

Japan's challenge to China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands
is not accidental but is an inevitable result of emerging
rightist elements in Japan's internal political situation and
Japan's intention to flex its muscle.

To illustrate this tendency recently, many Japanese have
distorted the country's history, glorified its war of aggression
and imbued its countrymen with a sense of militarism.

Some Japanese politicians are exaggerating the so-called "China
threat," trying their best to sow dissent between China and its
neighboring countries and inventing an excuse for the expansion
of its forces.

The Japanese government has strengthened the Japan-US security
system, expanded the scope of defense beyond Japan's borders and
even talked about "watching for trends of the Chinese military"
in its official defense white paper. Japan has continually
increased its military expenditure, built up its weaponry and
tried its best to send its forces abroad.

Asian countries have long expressed their concern that Japan
would embark on its old road of militarism. These fears are not
groundless as this series of activities seem to prove. Asian
countries should tell those expansionist Japanese not to do
anything foolish. At the same time, Asia must maintain high
vigilance over Japan's actions.

CHINA: Rightist Comeback in Japan: Cause for Vigilance

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Da Jun

Diaoyu Islands  Denial of Massacre   Denial of aggression  Balm
Visiting Yasukuni Shrine

This summer, Japanese rightists, with the connivance and and
support of the Japanese government, built a lighthouse and
erected a Japanese flag on the Diaoyu Island, the largest of the
Diaoyu Islands which have been part of China's territory since
ancient times. This provocative act cannot but arouse strong
indignation from the Chinese people as a wanton encroachment upon
China's territory.

Attempts

A review of Sino-Japanese relations suggests that Japan began to
covet China's Diaoyu Islands long ago.

In the late 1960s, large deposits of oil and natural gas were
discovered off the islands. The Japanese unilaterally took a
series of actions attempting to establish claim over the
territory. They first sent  exploration teams and then cruise
boats to the islands, removing the original Chinese marks and
replacing them with Japanese ones. They also renamed eight islets
in Japanese.

In 1978, when China and Japan were negotiating the signing of a
treaty of peace and friendship, some members of the Japanese Diet
(parliament) demanded that China recognize Japan's sovereignty
over the islands. The Japanese government, in answer to the
rightists' calls, dispatched patrol boats and airplanes to
monitor Chinese fishing boats working near the islands.

In May 1979, the Japanese shipped personnel and equipment to
Diaoyu Island and built a helicopter airport there. They also
sent an investigation team and a surveying mission to the area.

In October 1990, when the West was imposing sanctions against
China, Japanese rightists, with an understanding from the
government, built a beacon tower on one of the islets. The
Japanese government sent 12 ships and two helicopters to prevent
Taiwanese fishing boats from moving toward the islands.

These facts indicate that Japan's every move on Diaoyu Islands
was designed not only to attempt to seize the resources in the
vicinity but also to use the issue to plot against China. The
events occuring this summer well illustrate the issue.

Japan unexpectedly announced that it would redesignate July 20 as
Ocean Day and set it aside as a national holiday once again --
July 20 was a national holiday before World War II. The Japanese
royal prince and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto attended the
celebrations. On the same day, Japan officially began to
implement the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and
the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. By so doing Japan
expanded its waters by more than 10 times -- altogether more than
6 million square kilometers, the sixth largest in the world.

It seems, therefore, that Japan's celebration of the Ocean Day is
not purely incidental. The seizure of Diaoyu Island would add to
Japan's already large waters and resources on its continental
shelf. No wonder the Japanese government connived at the
rightists' activities on Diaoyu Island.

A Rightist Comeback

While the rightists were staging their shows on Diaoyu Island,
the Japanese cabinet adopted the 1996 defense white paper. The
official document contained such statements as "continuing to
watch for trends of the Chinese military," "Russia no longer a
threat to Japan" and "further cementing military cooperation with
the United States." It specifically blamed the military exercises
conducted by the Chinese Liberation Army in March 1996 for
"creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits."

The publication of the white paper is believed to be a result of
closer US-Japanese military cooperation, which occurred after US
President Bill Clinton visited Japan in April this year. While
expanding military cooperation with the United States, Japan put
China on top of its hypothetical enemy list.

There are other signs that indicate a comeback of rightism in
Japan. Some Japanese politicians openly deny the existence of
"comfort women" that the Japanese government recruited during
World War II for its Imperial Army. Prime Minister Hashimoto
openly visited the Yasukuni Shrine which houses the remains of
many top Japanese war criminals for worship. An art show
featuring Japanese atrocities during the Nanjing Massacre of 1937
had to be canceled in Osaka because of rightist threats.

On August 15, the 51st anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War
II, some Japanese staged a farce in Yasukuni Shrine, reopening
the old wound of other Asian nations. On that day, some ex-
Imperial Army soldiers put on their military uniform with a saber
on their belt, parading around the shrine. Some Diet members
joined the farce in shouting slogans such as "the Great East Asia
War was a sacred war" and "Tojo was innocent." Then they paid
homage to the shrine honoring the war criminals.

In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II,
Japan, instead of repenting its war record, intensified its
efforts to justify their acts of war in total defiance of world
opinion. A number of ministers and Diet members denied Japan's
history of aggression and, in an attempt to divert attention from
the government's attitude toward World War II, condemned China's
nuclear testing instead.

The so-called "no-war" resolution that was supposed to assure the
world of Japan's remorse over its past and determination for
peace was adopted by the House of Representative only and failed
to address the fundamental issues.

Japan has sought to become a political and military power. In
addition to whitewashing history, it has also broken the taboos
of limiting its military spending to less than 1 percent of the
gross national product and of not sending forces overseas.
Japan's Self-Defense Forces, armed with the most advanced
offensive weapons and spending US$50 billion annually, have
become a military force to be reckoned with. In 1996, Japan
expanded its range of defense to include the entire Asia-Pacific
region. These developments have aroused suspicion and vigilance
from many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including China.

Roots

After the end of World War II, although some major war criminals
such as Hideki Tojo were condemned to hang by the International
Tribunal, a number of other die-hard militarists who held
unshirkable responsibility for launching that war of aggression
were shielded by the occupying US forces as part of the US Cold
War strategy. Shortly after the war, many war criminals who had
not paid for their military crimes were set free by the United
States or its allies. Aided by rightists in the political and
financial circles, these ex-war criminals made a comeback in the
political arena and assumed major government offices, including
the office of prime minister. The question of whether that war
was a just or an unjust one, therefore, has never been answered
in clear-cut terms in Japan.

In sharp contrast, Germany, which was one of the three Axis
powers during World War II, took a completely different attitude.
In 1970, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt down in front
of the Warsaw Monument in memory of the Jews persecuted by Nazi
Germany during World War II. The world responded with
forgiveness. That act was possible because Germany under joint
occupation by the Allied powers took on a demilitarized approach
to history. In Germany, war criminals and those associated with
Nazism were under strong pressure from the government and the
society. Even to this day, Nazi war criminals at large are still
being hunted down. The Germans have been appraised of the Fascist
crimes and their grave consequences. Attempts to revive Nazism
are getting nowhere in Germany.

Japan's economic success has also lent to the uprise of the
conservative forces in Japan. With rightism and nationalism
running rampant, many Japanese choose not to confront their
history of aggression and disregard national feelings of other
peoples. Some Japanese attempt to cover up aggression in the
textbooks and the media. On the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, they confuse the perpetrators with victims of war.
Propped up by a sense of racial superiority, they increasingly
look down upon other Asian nations. In the eyes of many Japanese,
Japan is fast becoming a major power in the world.

CHINA: Backgrounder: History Proves Diaoyu Islands Are China's Territory

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China  Russia  DPRK  ROK  Japan  Diaoyu Islands  Ryukyu Islands
Taiwan Province

The Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea between China and
Japan, have belonged to China since ancient times. The islands
include some small islands and reefs, with the Diaoyu Island the
largest one covering an area of five square kilometers. Lacking
fresh water, no one can live there.

The islands are 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, 200
nautical miles east of China's mainland and 200 nautical miles
west of Japan's southernmost island Okinawa.

Geologically the islands are attached to Taiwan. The waters
around the islands are 100 to 150 meters deep and there is a
2,000-meter deep oceanic trench between the islands and Japan's
Okinawa islands.

Fishermen from China's Taiwan and Fujian and other provinces have
fished and collected herbs here for centuries.

The islands are recorded in a book published during the rule of
Yong Le (1403 to 1424 AD) in the Ming Dynasty, more than 400
years before Japan claimed discovery of the Diaoyu islands in
1884. Since then many historical documents refer to the islands.

In the 15th century during the Ming Dynasty, China included the
Diaoyu Islands into its coastal defense area. In 1556, General Hu
Zongxian was appointed governor to fight Japanese pirates and
defend the coastal area including the Diaoyu Islands.

A map published in Japan between 1783 and 1785 marking the
boundary of the Ryukyu Kingdom showed the Diaoyu Islands as
belonging to China.

Japan never questioned China's sovereignty over the islands
before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.

In April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to
sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which China ceded the whole
island of Taiwan and its surrounding islands including the Penghu
Islands to Japan.

Only since then has Japan had its own name for the area where the
Diaoyu Islands are located. Before that, Japanese maps marked the
islands by their Chinese names.

Japan was occupied by the United States after it was defeated in
World War II.

In 1951, Japan and the United States illegally signed a treaty in
San Francisco without the presence of China, which was one of the
victor countries in the World War II.

Although Article 2 of the treaty said that Japan surrendered its
claim over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, Article 3 wrongly
assigned the Diaoyu Islands, which Japan had stolen from China,
and other islands, to the Ryukyu zone which was under US control.

The then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai lodged a strong protest and
said the Chinese government would never recognize the San
Francisco Treaty.

In a statement on territorial waters in 1958, the Chinese
government said that Japan should return all the territory of the
People's Republic of China including Taiwan and the islands
around it to China.

On November 11, 1969, Japan and the United States signed an
agreement to return the Okinawa islands to Japan. In 1971, the
United States, proceeding from its Cold War policy against China,
returned the area under its trusteeship including the Diaoyu
Islands to Japan.

The Japanese government thereby regarded the islands as a part of
its Okinawa-ken prefecture and included them in the "air defense
distinguishing rim" of its Self-Defense Forces.

On this situation, the Chinese government issued a solemn
statement on December 30, 1971, announcing that the Diaoyu
islands are islands attached to Taiwan and they, like Taiwan,
have always been an alienable part of Chinese territory since
ancient times.

Consequently, it is an indisputable fact that the Diaoyu Islands
have historically been a part of China's territory.

The issue of the Diaoyu Islands once served as an obstacle to the
normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and the conclusion of
the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Taking into
consideration the overall interest to develop Sino-Japanese
friendship, the then Chinese and Japanese governments agreed to
settle the issue in the future.

However, the Japanese side has broken its promise repeatedly and
provoked incidents one after another in recent years in an
attempt to seize the islands.

CHINA: US Unilateral Action Protested

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China will by no means accept the unilateral action by the United
States of cutting China's 1996 textile export quota, a spokesman
for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said
on September 7.

The United States announced on Friday that it would cut its
import quota of this year's 13 categories of textiles from China
by 195,001 dozen and 134,029 kilograms, alleging that Chinese
textile products had been trans-shipped.

The spokesman described the cut as a severe violation of the
textile agreement reached between China and the United States,
because the US government took the action unilaterally without
presenting sufficient evidence and without full consultations.

After the United States presented a number of illegal textile
trans-shipment cases to China at the end of October 1995,
according to the spokesman, the Chinese side made a careful
investigation. The two sides exchanged views in Beijing between
March 25 and 27 this year, conscientiously checking related
materials of these cases. said the spokesman.

Judging by the materials provided, some cases were engineered
either by persons engaged in trans-shipment or by importers, and
others by individuals engaged in trans-shipment in collaboration
with importers, the spokesman stated and added that the Chinese
enterprises were wholly innocent of the transactions.

To further check the cases, the Chinese side wrote to the US side
on April 26 for more evidence. To date, however, the US side had
not provided any, but instead has made a unilateral assumption,
the spokesman noted. The Chinese government will by no means
accept it, he stressed.

The spokesman pointed out that the US government has continuously
raised obstacles to China's export of textiles to the United
States in recent years, severely hindering the Sino-US textile
trade.

He said that the Chinese government hopes that the Clinton
administration will reconsider its decision, with a stand
conducive to the development of Sino-US trade, and cancel the
import deduction action.

Otherwise, the spokesman said, the Chinese government will have
to respond further and the US side will be responsible for the
consequences.

CHINA: Minority Cities Step Up Opening

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A number of cities in ethnic minority regions of China have made
satisfying achievements in foreign trade and inter-city economic
cooperation, according to a meeting of mayors from capital cities
of the country's autonomous regions which was held recently in
Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia.

Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, completed
370 economic cooperation projects valued at 400 million yuan over
the past five years. During the first two quarters of this year
alone, foreign-funded enterprises in Urumqi exported products
valued at about US$13 million, up 65 percent on the 1995 period,
with major exports centering on machinery, clothing and woolen
products.

Hohhot has established cooperative ventures with some 20-odd
nations and regions in the wool spinning, electronics and leather
processing industries. It is currently home to some 180 foreign-
funded firms which yielded a total output value of 760 million
yuan.

Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, has established
solid relations with 15 foreign and domestic cities. It sponsors
economic and trade talks during the annual Sour Milk Festival
with last year's talks ending with consummation of 17 agreements.

Yanji City in east China's Jilin Province, approved 17 foreign-
funded enterprises during the first six months this year, raising
the number of such ventures in the city to 383, with total
investments reaching US$4.4 billion.

CHINA: Grain Yields Exceed Expectations

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Chinese government procured 9.08 million tons of early rice
by the end of August this year, substantially surpassing figures
covered by the purchase contracts signed with farmers last year.

According to its contracts with the farmers, the state had
expected to purchase 7.96 million tons of early rice.

A report released by the State Grain Reserve Administration
attributed the increased purchase to this summer's record-
breaking early rice harvest of 44 million tons -- an increase of
1.79 million tons from last year.

Summer grain generally accounts for 25 percent of the total
annual grain yield.

Although the total rice yield surpassed expectations, not all of
the 10 major early rice producing provinces enjoyed increased
harvests this year. Jiangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Hainan have
increased their early rice production, but Anhui, Hubei and
Sichuan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, all
of which have experienced heavy floods, were unable to meet last
year's rice yield.

With bumper harvests and high sale prices, each farmer expects to
enjoy a net income of 1,800 yuan this year, an increase of about
5 percent over last year.

However, cotton harvests this year will probably decrease by more
than 1 million tons from the 4.5 million tons harvested last
year, according to agricultural sources.

CHINA: Healthy School Meals

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Students who eat lunch at school can expect safer and more
nutritious meals, following a new regulation on the hygiene of
school meals.

The regulation was introduced by the Ministry of Public Health
recently and is targeted at improving the quality of school
meals, reducing cases of food poisoning and guaranteeing the
healthy physical development of Chinese children.

Under this regulation, all staff preparing and distributing
school meals must receive professional training in nutrition. The
meals must meet national hygiene standards and be properly
packaged to avoid contamination during transportation.

The regulation also encourages each school to assign a special
supervisor to oversee the general quality of the meals.

The ministry has also made public the daily intake of nutrients
recommended for children as reference for meal providers.

Schools are required to order meals only from licensed producers.
They must set up facilities for storing the meals hygienically
and for students to wash their hands and clean utensils.

Meal suppliers and schools who violate the above regulations will
be punished according to the food hygiene legislation. Serious
cases will be brought to court.

In Beijing, about 20 percent of all school children eat school
meals, according to a sample survey of 1,100 schools taken last
year.

About 5 percent of the meals are provided by individual
producers, the rest by school canteens.

School lunches are convenient for both students and their
families, but some meals are inadequate and pose a threat to the
students' health, said Zhu Peifu, a spokesman from the Ministry
of Public Health. He said some meal providers sell unhygienic or
even spoiled food to the students, and this can result in food
poisoning.

CHINA: Rail Opens Linking Beijing and HK

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China's new backbone railway line linking Beijing with Kowloon
officially opened on September 1. The first passenger train left
Beijing West Station the same day and arrived at its destination-
-Shenzhen 38 hours later.

At the opening ceremony in Beijing, Railway Minister Han Zhubin
said that the line will greatly alleviate the country's north-
south transportation pressure and improve China's overall railway
system.

The railway runs 2,553 km through Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong,
Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Guangdong before reaching Hong
Kong.

Sources from the ministry say that initially 40 freight trains
and 10 passenger trains will run daily at an average speed of 60
km per hour. The new passenger trains will run between Beijing
and Shenzhen, Beijing and Hefei, Jiujiang and Shenzhen, and
Wuchang and Shantou. Tianjin to Lianyungang services will also
make use of the new line.

The railway bureaus of Beijing, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Shanghai,
Nanchang plus the Guangzhou Railway Corp will share management.

Shenzhen people celebrated, convinced that the line will benefit
the fast growing economic development of Guangdong Province and
improve relations between the province and Hong Kong.

Officials from Shantou, Dongguan, Huizhou and Heyuan cities
located along the new rail line in Guangdong are even more
delighted. Months before the railway opened they had organized
trade fairs in Hong Kong to woo investors.

Heyuan and Huizhou cities are deliberating opening foreign
railway ports to link directly with Hong Kong, which now accounts
for about 70 percent of Guangdong's foreign investment and 80
percent of the province's foreign trade.

"The operation of the railway will also benefit Hong Kong," a
senior Hong Kong railway official said at a press conference in
Shenzhen on September 1.

The Ministry of Railways is ready to open passenger train
services between the Chinese capital and Hong Kong, according to
Sun Yongfu, vice-minister of railways.

The construction of the 40 billion yuan railway project started
in 1993 and was completed last November. Students Guaranteed

CHINA: Archives: Records For Future

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Archives would become increasingly important in the 21st century,
Chinese Premier Li Peng said when addressing the opening ceremony
of the 13th International Congress on Archives in Beijing on
September 2.

People need to draw on the wisdom and experience of their
predecessors to achieve development and prosperity and to deal
with complicated circumstances, Li said.

Over 2,600 delegates from 130 countries and regions attended the
six-day global congress -- the first held in a developing country
since the International Council of Archives (ICA) was set up in
1950. It was also the last grand gathering of top world
archivists for this century.

The theme of the congress is ''archives at the end of the
century, taking stock and looking ahead.''

Archives are the authentic recordings of the social activities of
human beings, stepping stones of the progress of human
civilization and an important component of the world cultural
heritage, the Chinese Premier said.

He called upon the international archive community to further
preserve and enhance the world's valuable heritage and provide
authentic historical records for future generations.

China has a long history and is a nation with a brilliant
culture, Li said, adding that thanks to the fine tradition of a
long-standing commitment to archives, the Chinese culture has
been carried forward from generation to generation and the
Chinese civilization maintains its strong cohesive force.

He said the Chinese government always looks upon the archives as
a major undertaking for preserving the original features of a
nation and as an important resource for the administration and
development of a country.

Governments at all levels attach importance to strengthening
guidance and supervision over archival work and have brought such
work in line with the agenda of various administrations and
social-development programs to ensure continuous and healthy
progress.

"Archives have played an important role in the Chinese reform and
opening policy and in its socialist modernization drive,'' Li
said.

The congress discussed the history and future of archival work in
various countries, global trends in legislation on archives, the
development strategy of international archival circles and other
important issues.

CHINA: Forum on Asia: A Commitment to Peace

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China's destiny is closely linked with that of other countries in
Asia, Chinese Premier Li Peng said while addressing the 21st
Century Forum.

"China's development needs a stable and prosperous Asia; and
Asia's development needs a stable and prosperous China," Li added
in his keynote speech entitled "The Impact of China's Development
and the Rise of Asia on the World".

The premier stated that China will always be committed to world
peace. "The Chinese government and the Chinese people care
greatly about the future of Asia, and we stand ready to work with
other Asian countries for the stability and development of this
region," Li added.

The forum, sponsored by the country's top political advisory
body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), was closed on September 6 after three days of
discussions. Over 500 statesmen and scholars from across the
globe, including former US President George Bush, former US
Secretary of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and former
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, attended the forum.

The participants discussed China's role in the next century and
future political and economic trends for Asia's development.

The forum concluded that Asia has a promising 21st century and
that it should contribute even more to world peace and
development.

According to Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, one of the
participants at the forum, the next century will see Asia recover
its place in the world.

"For East Asia to maintain its rapid growth, peace and stability
must be secured. East and West together are responsible for the
future," Lee remarked while addressing the forum.

He also suggested that various nations learn to accommodate and
adjust to each other, even when they cannot agree.

He said that although most Western analysts view the rise of
China as a de-stabilizing influence on the present world order,
China has the power to demonstrate that, in the year 2020, a
huge, prosperous nation of 1.3 billion people, with a per-capita
GDP about one-fourth of that in the United States, can only be
better for the world than an impoverished and unstable nation of
the same population.

Lee emphasized that growth in China and the rest of East Asia
will provide opportunities for the West, and will also produce a
steadier global balance, both economic and strategic.

Talking about relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, Lee said that he considered it impossible for Taiwan to
be independent against the will of a united and an economically
powerful China.

In his opinion, the two sides of the Straits should not get into
military competition, and neither the United States nor Europe
should look for excuses to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan.

Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in his remarks
at the forum that the United States and China have a common stake
in Asia's progress and stability and must work together to make a
"decisive contribution to work order".

"Some in America are calling for a containment policy toward
China as they watch her rise to industrial strength. But this is
an illusion," Kissinger stated emphatically, adding, "Such a
policy would have exactly the opposite effect and will have no
takers."

Awards for the Fourth China "Radar Watch" Science Competition for
young students were presented in Beijing on August 23, 1996.

The goal of the competition, funded by the Swiss-based Radar Co.
and sponsored by science associations from Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangdong, is to evoke a zest for learning science and enhance
the actual applications capabilities of youngsters.

Some 900 students participated in the event which lasted for
three and a half months. Procedures for the event included
recommendations, preliminary and follow-up contests, and the
final. Three first, six second and nine third-place awards were
presented.

The appraisal committee, headed by Wang Daheng, an academician
with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, consisted of professors and
experts from various scientific disciplines.

The Radar Co. has provided funding for each of the four events
thus far held. A Radar representative announced that the company
will continue to support educational undertakings for young
Chinese students.

CHINA-CULTURE: The Sci & Ed Program Behind Olympic Golds

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

ZHANG YANHUI

Xu Yiming, chief coach of the Chinese Diving Team, is training Fu
Mingxia with a kind of special apparatus.

While people acclaim the combatant spirit and superb skills of
the Chinese athletes at the 26th Olympic Games, few know that
behind the athletes and coaches embracing each other for the
victories, there is a cause that helps the moulding of gold
medalists--the Science and Education Program of the State
Physical Culture and Sports Commission (SPCSC).

Athletics has evolved from the first stages of running, jumping,
throwing and pushing to the high level of today. In human
challenge to the limit of physical potential, it is not enough to
merely rely on the arduous training of athletes. They should know
at what time and under what condition can each muscle of the body
give forth the greatest strength, and be good at using it, just
as they should do in relation to a precision instrument. This is
what the sports scientific research studies.

According to Lu Xiaojie, deputy head of the Science and
Technology Division under the Department of Science and Education
of the SPCSC, the domestic sports scientific research focuses on
four fields of sports psychology, fatigue elimination, skill
appraisal and skill examination. The commission has allocated
special money since 1985 for scientific research and technical
service. It put in 2 million yuan in 1994 and organized 200
experts from 20 scientific research institutions into groups to
apply research results in practice. Among the 56 scientific
research subjects, major events, such as gymnastics, swimming and
weightlifting, involve excellent athletes Wang Junxia, Gao
Hongmiao and Cheng Xiaoyan who have special subject groups to
help monitor and instruct their training.

Li Furong, director of the SPCSC Training Bureau, noted that an
important experience of the Chinese Table-Tennis Team in
maintaining their dominance in the world for over three decades
is placing priority on theory. In effect, the remarkable progress
made in many other sports events is inseparable from sports
scientific research. The experts of the Chinese Swimming Team
examine and monitor the physiological and biochemical indexes of
each athlete every day. It often happens that the detailed data
of the morning training have already been delivered to the
coaches before the start of afternoon training, thus effectively
supporting the scientific sports training.

It's a long-term task for sports scientific research to enhance
the scientific training to a higher level. According to Lu, the
applied basic research in China mainly relies on the over 40
institutions and some universities throughout the country. A
relatively stable scientific research team has been formed. Every
year, a group of graduates from Tsinghua, Peking and Beijing
Medical Science universities will continue their advanced studies
at the sports institutions and will become the reserve force of
China's sports scientific research.

"The competition of athletes on the arena is actually a test of
the level of the coaches' scientific training. The athletes with
excellent coaches have grasped the initiative of winning.'' said
Yuan Weimin, vice-minister the SPCSC and the world-famous coach
who had led the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team to marvelous
achievements.

In 1982, the SPCSC set up a special office of cultural education
in charge of the training of coaches. As briefed by Li Quanqiang,
deputy head of the office, the current coaches' training system
consists of four parts including academic education, professional
training, short-term training and information service. According
to a survey at 29 provinces and cities in 1995, 61 percent of the
25,000 full-time coaches have received an education at or above
college level, 16 percent of whom have the same level of
education as undergraduates.

During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the SPCSC
will carry out a wider professional training plan for coaches
throughout the country in order to provide basic training for
over 90 percent coaches, accelerating the construction of
teaching materials and a teachers' contingent and finally form a
training network with several training centers at the core,
covering more areas nationwide. Beginning from the year 2000,
those coaches who haven't got a qualified certificate of
professional training will not be allowed to apply for position
or promotion.

Analysed by SPCSC officials, competition on the arena in the next
15 years will be manifest more and more as the competition for
science and technology and the Science and Education Program will
help prepare China's athletics for future competitions.

CHINA-CULTURE: Female Orchestra Graces Beijing Stage

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Women's Philharmonic Orchestra (WPO), consisting of 80 female
members led by the renown conductor Zheng Xiaoying, presented a
mid-August concert in the Beijing Concert Hall.

The audience was delighted with the repertoire which included the
overture for The Marriage of Figaro and various selections by the
orchestra's string section. They  also heard superb renditions of
Zhang Lida's first violin concerto entitled Indistinct Harmony,
Xu Zhenmin's symphonic fantasy Snow-Covered Plum Garden, and
Symphony No.9 by Shostakovich.

The event represented the orchestra's second performance since
its debut during the Fourth World Conference on Women. The latest
performance brought back memories of the WPO's September debut to
mark the opening of the FWCW, an event which won acclaim from the
thousands of female deputies from across the world.

The Women's Philharmonic Orchestra grew from a chamber orchestra
founded six years ago by more than 30 professional musicians from
different Beijing art troupes and conservatories of music.

The chamber orchestra focused on introducing Chinese, foreign
classics and modern music to the widest possible Chinese
audience, especially young people, with members raising funds to
present more than 200 performances.

In 1993, leaders of the orchestra began selecting and training
female musicians proficient in wind instruments, and in turn
formed the existing female symphony orchestra.

In addition to established professional performers, the orchestra
also includes students from the Central Conservatory of Music and
various middle schools. All musicians, ranging from teenagers to
the elderly, are required to fulfill designated standards.

According to violinist Situ Zhiwen, one of the founders, the
Women's Philharmonic Orchestra provides an excellent opportunity
for nurturing young female musicians.

CHINA-CULTURE: Sino-US Archeological Cooperation

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A Sino-US archeological team, consisting of representatives from
the Henan Institute of Archeology and the Anthropology Department
from the University of Missouri, proceeded under the auspices of
the State Bureau of Cultural Relics to conduct a highly fruitful
survey between June-August this year. The survey, which covered
an area of 100 km in the upper reaches of the Yinghe River
Valley, focused on village ruins dating from the late Longshan to
the Erlitou cultures. The team used the global satellite
positioning and geographic information systems for the research
project.

The team defined the range, period and cultural significance of
all sites, and precisely determined the geographic location,
longitude, latitude and elevation. The data obtained was then
entered into the database of the geographic information system,
which in turn yielded computerized color relief maps for each and
every ruins site. The team's accomplishments provided accurate
positioning for future surveys, as well as laid a solid base for
trial excavations and further studies scheduled for next year.

The new approaches adopted by the joint team were of great
academic value with regard to research into the disintegration of
the primitive society, the emergence of private ownership and
countries, formation of the slave system and the origin of
Chinese civilization.

CHINA-CULTURE: New Trade Emerges From Culture

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Along with the newly emerging industrialists, creators, planners,
advertisers and designers, culture has entered the market and
social lives in the form of industrialization in recent years.

Engaging a large group of experts, scholars, artists, writers,
journalists and cultural agents as their consultants, the planner
companies have suddenly emerged as a new force early in the
1990s. They have become one of main strengths in the cultural
sector in a short time, because they start from a high point,
cover a wide-ranging area and are good at grasping the
characteristics of metropolitan culture. With the continuous
extension of cultural planner management, the market is expanding
increasingly, and cartoon companies, subject selection publishing
agencies and other sectors are constantly merging.

Generally speaking, people engaged in dress designing must have
their own factories and outlets. However, a fashion company,
which opened business not long ago in Beijing, is neither
producing ready-made clothes nor selling them, but engages in
selling designs. According to reports, over the past two months
the company has sold more than 40 designs to over 10  clothing
companies.

In Shanghai, watching TV has been regarded as a profession, a new
fashion trend of media investigation. In step with Shanghai being
an open international market, advertising has developed rapidly.
Those enterprises, clients and advertising agents who spend huge
amounts of money for advertising in TV naturally care that their
advertisements are broadcast correctly and on schedule. So,
spending just a little sum of money each month, they can have
their advertisements done by so-called ``watching TV company''
and can obtain an accurate broadcast record, thus making this
really a necessary matter.

The supplying of this data is only part of the companies'
business. Their main business is to offer more materials of
competitive brand-name products. Relying on their materials,
producers make appropriate readjustment for their ad. planning
when a new product brand is put on the market.

Some experts hold information and knowledge, creation and
designing, culture and art, appearing as new industries, have
become a new point of economic growth in today's China. The
management of culture with the viewpoint of creating and selling
it has become a general trend and opened a realm for an ever-
fiercer competitive market. At the same time, the economic
infiltration has injected vigor into the prospering culture.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Petroleum Exploration Welcomed

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China has recently abandoned the practice of prioritizing oil
exploration by administrative divisions.

To better manage the resource and attract foreign oil firms to
make exploration in China, responsible department has divided the
country's potential oil fields into four categories: areas for
foreign cooperation and bidding; areas inviting bids for risk
exploration by domestic oil-gas enterprises; exploring areas for
state-owned companies and exploring areas managed by oil gas
fields.

A spokesman of the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and
Development Corp. (CNOGEDC) said this new mechanism will help
expand the range of oil exploration, particularly in oil-abundant
basins in west China which have lied idle for a long time.

Thus far, China has opened to the outside world 2.50 million
square km of oil exploration areas, and signed more than 30
contracts and agreements for risk oil explorations with foreign
oil companies. Foreign business people, in line with these
contracts, have started exploration in areas covering 150,000
square km.

Domestic oil-gas firms have also exhibited great enthusiasm in
the bidding of western oil exploration areas. Not long ago,
Daqing, Shengli and North China oilfields won the bidding for
exploring blocks covering 117,000 square km in the northwest,
southwest and east sections of the Tarim Basin.

The CNOGEDC will provide both domestic and overseas explorers
with information on oil bearing regions in the country, in the
hopes of enhancing the success rate.

The corporation predicted that under the new mechanism, four or
five oil fields will be discovered this year with combined
exploitable capacities exceeding 120 million tons.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Ing Barings Offers Chinese Stocks

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Sources from Barings Shanghai revealed that Ing Barings
successfully helped two Chinese enterprises issue stocks valued
at US$140 million between July 15-19.

Barings itself purchased stocks valued at US$100 million outright
from the China Overseas Land Investment Corp., a Hong Kong listed
company under the Ministry of Construction. Said corporation, one
of the major construction companies in Hong Kong, had market
capital valued at US$1.1 billion prior to the new stock issue.

The corporation decided to float new stocks valued at US$100
million in order to expand investments in infrastructure
facilities and meet the need for capital funding. Barings sold
its outright stock purchase within only one day, with 40 percent
of the stocks going to Asia, 39 percent to Europe, and 21 percent
to the United States.

The Barings also floated B-shares in Shenzhen for the Wuxi
Little Swan Co. Ltd., a company engaged in the design,
development and manufacture of automatic washing machines. The
goal of the B-share issue valued at US$40.4 million was to expand
the company's production capacity and provide capital needed for
investments in a joint venture operated by companies from
Matsushita of Japan and Siemens A. G. of Germany. Barings
successfully sold the shares to investors in Asia (88 percent,
Europe (7 percent), and the United States (5 percent). Investors
were introduced to the stock issues during meetings held in Hong
Kong, Singapore, London and Edinburgh.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Beijing International Auto Show

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Beijing plans to host an annual International Automobile Industry
Exhibition in either June or July beginning in 1997. The
exhibition will be held in the China International Exhibition
Center.

The decision to hold the annual event is designed to solve
problems resulting from the fact that frequent exhibitions
previously held in Beijing placed a heavy burden on exhibitors.

The first international automobile exhibition was held in 1993.
The two exhibitions held last June attracted several hundred
domestic and foreign auto manufacturers and well over 700,000
people.

Public opinion indicates that the comprehensive annual
international auto industrial exhibition will ensure authority
needed to promote exchanges and cooperation between the domestic
and international automobile industries.

The annual exhibition will be jointly sponsored by the Ministry
of Machine-Building Industry, the China National Automotive
Industry Corp., the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, and the China Automotive Industry
Association.

Latest statistics indicate that the country's current annual
demand for motor vehicles stands at 11.5 million units. China
imported almost 2.13 million motor vehicles valued at US$21.8
billion between 1980-95, including nearly 1.05 million buses
valued at US$7.48 billion. The figures exclude units imported
through informal channels.

CHINA-BUSINESS: CITIC Expands Transnational Trade

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A joint bid group consisting of two New Zealand companies and
CITIFOR Inc., an overseas subsidiary of the China International
Trust and Investment Corp., won timbering rights to large tract
of forest offered by the New Zealand government.  The group won
the rights on August 20, 1996, with a bid of US$1.34 billion. The
corporation's effort represents an important strategy adopted to
consolidate overseas affairs, expand its transnational
businesses, and eliminate shortages of resources on both the
domestic and international markets.

The 188,000 hectares of forest land is expected to yield between
3.1-3.6 million cubic meters of timber.  CITIFOR Inc. holds 37.5
percent of the stock in the project, with the other two
companies--the Lion Group and Brierley--respectively holding 37.5
percent and 25 percent shares. Funding was obtained in accordance
with the common international practice of a non-recourse loan.

The establishment of CITIFOR Inc. in the United  States was
designed to solve resource shortages on Chinese markets and
expand overseas markets. Over the past 10-odd years, the company
has accumulated vast experience in international market
competition. In recent years, CITIFOR has attempted to expand
forest land development by opening markets in Chile, Canada,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The related operations
undertake intensive processing activities in the forest industry,
and seek opportunities to develop high value-added forest
products.

The New Zealand investment will create new opportunities for the
company's further development.

The '96 China International Children's Commodities Fair,
sponsored by the Guangzhou city government and the China Council
for the Promotion of International Trade, will be held in the
China Foreign Trade Center in Guangzhou between December 6-10.

The Hong Kong Trade and Development Council (HKTDC) plans to
organize a large delegation of firms to participate in the fair.
The fair's Hong Kong Hall will provide the region's firms with an
opportunity to tap the vast market potential for domestic
children's commodities.

China's 300 million children under 14 years old account for one-
fourth of the nation's total population. The vast market
potential cannot be neglected, said Yin Shuzhen, deputy manager
of the HKTDC Promotion Section.

"Traditionally, the Chinese pay great attention to  the
upbringing of future generations. The quality of life for
children is rising continually along with the development of the
domestic economy. China's one-child policy allowed parents to
allocate additional funds needed for rearing children. The
advantageous conditions have helped to form a sizeable market for
children's goods." said Yin.

"The fair, the first of its kind to be held in Guangzhou, will
provide children's goods manufacturers in Hong Kong with
opportunities to engage in trade talks and discuss cooperative
ventures with buyers and traders from all over China. Yin added,
"the fair will also help to expand markets."

 Participants will offer various types of children's clothing,
adornments, stationery, toys, electronic games, health foods,
commodities for infants, educational materials and musical
instruments.

CHINA-BUSINESS: VISA Introduces VSAT Technology

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) system now enables
China's VISA member banks to enjoy the great convenience of
international credit card transactions, with successful tests of
VSAT recently carried out in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Application
of the VSAT technology has provided China's member banks with
"wireless" links to VisaNet, VISA's global authorization,
clearance and settlement network.

The VSAT system makes it possible to link various local
authorized transactions without leasing telephone networks. Users
across China can now carry out credit card settlement procedures
with maximum ease and security. The VSAT system enables banks to
relay and receive settlement information from data processing
centers in the United States and Japan within seconds. But
currently, direct telephone links with VISA data processing
centers are necessary.

Application of the reliable VSAT system eliminates former
geographical barriers, and more importantly overcomes the
insufficient capacity of telephone networks in some countries.
China's credit card industry can now enter the stage of rapid
international business development. In addition, installing the
VSAT system requires only one-third of the time previously needed
to install traditional or digital telephone lines.

According to Raymond Chan, VISA executive vice-president and
general manager for North Asia, China is the first country in
North Asia to use VSAT for international credit card
transactions. The advanced technology effectively overrides the
inadequacies of the previous network and provides immediate
possibilities for the internationalization of China's credit card
industry.

CHINA-BUSINESS: New Measure for Foreign Exchange

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

On July 1 this year, the People's Bank of China introduced a
measure of allowing foreign-funded enterprises to deal directly
with banks when settling or selling foreign exchange.
Implementation of the new measure represents a major step leading
to the eventual convertibility of the renminbi under current
accounts, and has helped to link China more closely with the
international economic system. In addition, it has enabled
foreign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency when settling or
selling foreign exchange, and has strengthened the confidence of
overseas investors in the mainland market.

Implementation of the new measure has narrowed the gap between
China's existing exchange control system and stipulations in
Article 8 of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.
The effort has also demonstrated China's determination to further
its opening policy. At the same time, ongoing implementation
effort has created favorable conditions for ensuring the future
free convertibility of the renminbi.

Application of the new measure has provided a favorable
environment for promoting the economic development of inland
China, and has exerted major influence in the following areas. It
has enabled foreign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency in
settling and selling foreign exchange, with said enterprises now
enjoying the same rights as domestic enterprises to buy foreign
exchange under current accounts. In addition, they can settle and
sell foreign exchange by presenting appropriate documentation to
banks and the foreign exchange control administration has no
need to examine or approve them.

The new measure permits foreign-funded enterprises to complete
all formalities for the settlement and sale of foreign exchange
with banks, or to buy and sell foreign exchange through foreign
exchange regulation centers as before. The measure thus expands
channels available for foreign-funded enterprises to buy and sell
foreign exchange.

Banks can now determine exchange rate quotations in accordance
with market supply and demand. Service charges are waived and
exchange rates for purchases of over US$1 million are subject to
negotiation. Bank calculations for foreign exchange are more
flexible than those at foreign exchange regulation centers.

The new measure has greatly reduced the 3-4-day period foreign-
funded enterprises were previously required to complete all
transaction procedures at foreign exchange regulation centers.
The new measure enables traders to immediately settle accounts in
banks.

In addition, the Chinese government has standardized market
management by tightening supervision and control of the exchange
accounts of foreign-funded enterprises.

ventures with 32 foreign partners which include 28 of the world
top 50 oil producers. Foreign capital so far introduced has
reached US$500 million.

China has also developed considerable oil and natural gas
production capacity in overseas areas, while gaining rights to
prospect, participate in share-holding ventures and tap oil in a
number of countries, including Peru, Russia, Thailand, Canada,
Papua New Guinea and Sudan.

CHINA: China's Agriculture: Hopeful Despite Existing Problems

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Zhou Xin

Jorgen Delman, a 1982 economics graduate from Peking University,
returned to Denmark and earned a Ph.D. with a doctorate thesis on
the promotion of Chinese agriculture. Delman formerly worked in
the China office of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and
now serves as director of the China-EU Center for Agricultural
Technology (CECAT) which was established in 1990.

CECAT, a highly successful agricultural technology popularization
center comparable to the Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm, is
located in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. CECAT has scored
remarkable success over the past five years by playing an
intermediate role in promoting both domestic and overseas
agrotechnological and economic cooperation. The EU Committee has
decided to continue its investments in the center. Thus far,
investments from China and EU have totaled well over 100 million
yuan.

Delman, an eyewitness of China's agricultural development over
the past 10-plus years, provided the following answers to
questions during a recent interview:

Question:  How wide is the gap between Chinese  and modern
European agriculture?

Answer:  China can learn at least two very important things from
Europe. The first and foremost lesson centers on raising
agricultural efficiency, a major issue currently facing China,
and in particular, raising the economic efficiency of individual
farmers. Secondly, China has consistently emphasized increased
gross output, but it should also consider eliminating waste.
China wastes excessive amounts of grain, vegetables, fruit and
meat between the harvest and purchasing cycle. Nonetheless,
technology is readily available to solve the related basic
problems.

The key problem concerns the availability of land, or the scale
of a farm. A small farm makes it difficult to raise efficiency.
The solution rests with private ownership, a previous practice
which seems not to work on Chinese agriculture. Yet another
measure centers on practicing economy of scale by mechanizing
joint production, which has already been introduced in many of
China's major suburban areas. The rural population in some areas
has dropped, with the figure for Chongqing City standing at only
5 percent of the total, or the same level as Denmark. On the
other hand, however, the rural population in Sichuan Province
accounts for between 60-70 percent of the total. Therefore, China
should formulate policies in accordance with the population,
especially in southern areas where there are sharp contradictions
between population and land.

Another problem centers on high prices. China Daily recently
reported that prices for several agricultural products have
surpassed prices on the world market. The problem is most likely
the result of high production costs, excessive waste and poor
circulation efficiency. In terms of the latter, the large number
of intermediate organizations have led to price differences for
farm produce. While similar problems exist in European countries,
but the gaps involved are much less noticeable. For example,
farmers in Denmark and the Netherlands control the entire
circulation process from production to consumption. I recently
learned that China's Ministry of Agriculture will  introduce a
farm produce wholesale market as part of its ``Vegetable Basket''
project to protect the interests of both producers and consumers.
China's high prices and low-level production technology make it
possible to solve all related problems, and the central
government has announced it will raise the level of investment
and technology in agriculture.

Q: Will technology play a major role in China's agricultural
sector?

A:  The market is the key factor, with one of the major roles of
technology being to provide products for the market. Animal
husbandry developed rapidly on China's eastern plains following
an effort by the Ministry of Agriculture to promote the use of
straw as feed. The ensuing success proves it wrong to believe
that the area lacked potential for animal husbandry. The
livestock market on the plains is indeed more promising than
those in the Inner Mongolian and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
regions due to its close proximity to consumers and low costs.

Raising the efficiency of agriculture depends on a number of
factors, including technology, organization and the type of
economic system. CECAT primarily focuses on providing technology
needed to solve problems, to meet the needs of the market, and to
help farmers raise both their income levels and living standards.

Technological problems demanding prompt solutions center on
specialized feed and searching for grain replacements. In this
regard, China has introduced unconventional feed products to
sustain 20 million head of cattle in developed livestock areas in
Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces.

Q: What is the scope of Sino-European agrotechnology
cooperation?

A:  China can easily find cooperative partners in European
countries. Earlier this year, CECAT organized a visit by a
delegation of 20-odd North European fishing companies interested
in providing fisheries technology to China. Next year, the
Netherlands will provide a soft loan of US$5 million for the
construction of an animal protein feed plant in Chengdu, capital
of Sichuan Province. CECAT is directly involved in the project
which looks very promising since China faces a shortage of animal
protein feed and related prices continue to rise.

Countries with close cooperative relations with China include
Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Britain. I firmly believe
there is also great potential for cooperative relations with a
number of other countries. Spain faces severe water shortages on
the same scale as China. I visited the former last year and found
extensive Spanish technology which would highly usable to China,
especially northern areas. CECAT is currently extending great
effort to promote agricultural cooperation between China and
Spain.

Q: What are the prospects for Chinese agriculture to attract
foreign investment?

A:  Regardless of certain difficulties, there is still great
potential for some projects to attract foreign investment. Rising
prices for Chinese agricultural products will serve as yet
another magnet for attracting foreign investment. In addition,
demand will continue to increase along with the constantly rising
income levels of Chinese citizens. I regularly tell foreign food-
processing businesses of the vast potential for food markets in
China's major cities over the next 10 years. Some companies,
including breweries, meat and dairy processors, have already
begun operations in China.

The key to attracting investors rests with the transparency of
China's entire system. The level of transparency is, in fact,
much higher than that of only 10 years ago. For example, a few
short years ago prices for farm produce seemed to be regarded as
state secrets. Now, however, prices are regularly carried by
publications such as Farmer's Daily. While investing in China is
much easier than ever before, success and the level of returns
rest with the type of project and one's understanding of the
market. CECAT is working to help raise the level of transparency
by providing foreign firms with timely information concerning the
situation in China.

Q: You have observed Chinese agriculture for the past 10 years.
Can China solve its grain and agricultural issues?

A: China has great prospects for the gradual development of
agricultural development. While China currently imports some
grain, the volume is significantly lower than some foreign
claims. Chinese agriculture can ensure the country's needs, with
the growth rate of grain output outstripping the population
growth rate for the past 10 years. While grain development has
been somewhat sluggish, areas such as meat and animal husbandry
have been growing rapidly, thereby indicating China's vast
resources and potential.

2. Headquarters of the Beijing Yinyan Electronic Flash Co. Ltd.

The Beijing Yinyan (Silver Swallow) Electronic Flash Co. Ltd.,
the first joint venture of the Beijing Labor Services Co., was
established in 1984. Yinyan electronic flash units have sold well
in China in the past decade, with the company exporting products
to the United States, Denmark, the Netherlands, Panama and other
countries and regions. The company has continually led its sector
in terms of production, product mix and economic indices, and has
held a 60 percent share of the domestic market.

The fact that Yinyan has maintained an untarnished image as a
famous product has helped the company increase its market share
and enhance its reputation with consumers.

Yinyan has introduced advanced equipment and precision testing
instruments to develop and produce flash units. The company has
placed priority on product quality and customer satisfaction,
with the general public and amateur photographers offering a
ready market for its products. The functions and quality of
Yinyan's 20 types of flash units rival imported products, with
prices equalling 25-33 percent of that of similar imports.

Yinyan's insistence on high quality has narrowed the gap with
foreign products and enabled the company to retain a substantial
share of the domestic market. Yinyan flash units won the Beijing
Famous-Brand Products Award in 1994.

The company has extended great effort to retain its label as a
famous brand. For example, Yinyan has adopted ISO9000 standards
to ensure product development and has introduced a quality
control guarantee system in accordance with international
standards.

Yinyan continues to adhere to international manufacturing
standards and fully expects to emerge as a world-famous brand in
the near future.

natural herbs that target infant problems such as abdominal
weakness and high susceptibility to chills and fever. The belt
draws on TCM principles and can be used on children of 10 years
old or under.

The invention of the 505 Vital Herb Belt For Children has helped
raise the research on herbal external-use health products to a
new scientific level. The belt enjoys a high reputation not only
in China but also in the United States, France, Japan, Thailand,
Hong Kong and other countries and regions.

Main Functions: Nourishing life essence and vital energy, curing
indigestion, enhancing the kidneys and immune function, improving
the spleen and stomach, ventilating troubled lungs and soothing
asthma, relieving convulsions, and preventing influenza and fatal
epidemic diseases.
