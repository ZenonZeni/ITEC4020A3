<CENTER>The Message of the Report<br>
of the<br>
International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century<P>
</CENTER><P>
</B>Ministers, colleagues, friends,<P>
<P>
On the eve of the twenty-first century, reflection and debate are intense on the future of human society. Education, always the object of aspirations and expectations concerning its contribution to the improvement of the human condition, has not escaped scrutiny of its role in preparing the actors of the coming century.<P>
<P>
In this context, and in keeping with the mission of UNESCO, Federico Mayor requested me in 1993 to chair an International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century. The Commission was composed of fifteen persons with a broad range of experience, competence, and cultural and professional backgrounds. Formally established at the beginning of 1993, it was mandated to study and reflect on the challenges facing education in the coming years, and to issue a report containing suggestions and recommendations that could serve as an agenda for renewal and action for policy-makers and officials at the highest levels. Although it was financed by UNESCO, and was able to draw on the rich experience and information available there, the Commission was completely independent in carrying out its work and in formulating its report.<P>
<P>
Today I should like to tell you in general terms something about the work and conclusions of the Commission, and make a few remarks concerning human resources in Europe.<P>
<P>
When we began our work, we were, naturally, aware that education has been the object of profound reflection and analysis for thousands of years. Thinkers of all civilizations have addressed their thoughts to the best ways of educating youth. Most of them have examined the very issues raised in our report. Thus, we did not, and could not, aim towards a complete break with the past. Rather, we wished to look at the relationship between education and society, at a time when humanity is facing a variety of new challenges and transformations, to provide an analysis that would enable educational systems to build on that past and at the same time propose keys for entry into the coming century. Our report, we felt, could provide an angle of vision through which to try to perceive the link between the past and the future, and a framework by which to look at what changes would be needed in educational thought and practice.<P>

Choices about education are choices about the kinds of societies we wish to build and to live in. These vary enormously, but they share some common features. Everywhere, there is a quest for a new vision of humanity that can help us live our increasing interdependence in a constructive way, that aims to enable each human being to live in dignity and in harmony with others.<P>
<P>
<h3>I. <B>A look towards the future<P></h3>

</B>How can one look towards building a future that can, with some probability, emerge from today's reality, but that is at the same time not entirely dependent on today's constraints? Having worked for many years in forecasting and long-range planning, I am well placed to know the extreme limitations of trying to project ourselves into the future. As have most of you, I have had many opportunities to examine the gap between forecasts and what actually comes to pass. Still, we felt it necessary to look at today's dominant trends and to try to extract from them some lessons for the ways in which learning could be better organized in function of them.<P>
<P>
The world of today is dominated by globalization, but the advantages of this globalization in terms of communication, of scientific progress, of economic growth, have been far from equitably distributed. Rising unemployment and the exclusion of some groups from the benefits of social progress are striking in many developed economies. Inequalities of development, notably in access to education, to the resources of food, health and infrastructure necessary for a decent existence, are denied to hundreds of millions of people. According to the latest Human Development Report, half the inhabitants of our planet, more than three billion people, have incomes of less than two dollars a day. The World Summit for Social Development held just a year and a half ago here in Copenhagen provided an admirable analysis of the problems and furnished the countries a framework within which to work towards solutions. Yet, the conference last week in Stockholm provided another reminder of the tragedy of lost youth and endangered futures that are the lot of millions of our children. The hope for a better and more peaceful world held out by the end of the Cold War is yet to be real ized.<P>
<P>
In this context, we must confront a series of tensions that are not new, but that will be central to the problems of the twenty-first century. First, there is the tension between the <B>global and the local: </B>in order to participate in a global society, we must be capable of understanding our roots. We must be able to live together in the communities to which we naturally belong, in harmony with neighbours with whom we may or may not share a common language, history, religion, or view of the world. In a world in which information, ideas, and ways of doing things spread over the planet in a few months, days, or instants, each human being is challenged to adapt continuously in response to global change. At the same time, though, there is both a trend and a need for understanding and maintaining diversity.<P>
<P>
That is why we highlight the tension between the <B>universal and the individual. </B>Globalization brings with it the risk of diminishing the rich diversity among individuals, cultures, and traditions. Globalization of economic phenomena has been seen as helping in the emergence of a few dominant languages, cultural codes, and ways of behaviour. In reaction, and with the legitimate aim of protecting minority cultures, some groups can be tempted to reject even rights and values that have long been accepted as part of the universal human heritage. Finally, there is a tension between <B>the spiritual and the material, </B>which brings out the age-old search of each individual for moral ideals and values. This tension is much in evidence at a time when the benefits of material progress are seen to leave so many people behind.<P>
<P>
Against this backdrop of tensions, we chose three themes around which the role of education could be considered and reviewed.<P>
<P>
The <B>first </B>of these three is the emergence of a world society. This world society,

however, is emerging from a collection of local communities. So, for education this means that understanding the world requires first of all understanding oneself, one's past and one's environment. This has always been true, but is even more important today. It will be imperative, in an interdependent world, to understand the forces that make this world interdependent, in order to learn to live in harmony with others. We are challenged more than ever to reinforce the links of co-operation and solidarity that are expressed in the United Nations system and in regional groupings and other international bodies. Indeed, the Director-General of UNESCO has placed particular emphasis on the relationship between education and the development of a culture of peace.<P>
<P>
The <B>second </B>theme is the need to maintain <B>social cohesion while favouring individual creativity </B>and bringing out the full potential of each individual. What we are talking about is using education as a means of preserving diversity, of giving each individual the opportunity to learn and develop talents. This implies diversity in both teaching methods and content, diversity in both space and time of learning. At the same time, initial education must introduce an understanding of <B>democratic participation, </B>at an age when young people form their values and their critical judgement. Young people need to learn very early about the practical consequences of the values that underlie democracy and social cohesion. I do not think it is going too far to say that contemporary democracies are facing a dangerous split between political life and private life and behaviour. Thus, education needs to attempt to counteract with this unfortunate disinterest for public service and public policy on the part of many individuals.<P>
<P>
The <B>third theme </B>is the necessary transition from a <B>simple search for economic growth to that of sustainable development. </B>This preoccupation with making progress serve the dignity of all human beings has been reflected in the major initiatives of the United Nations System: the Rio summit on the environment, the social summit here in Copenhagen, the population summit in Cairo, and the conference on women in Beijing. The concept of sustainable development places human beings at the centre of economic considerations, and so it has major implications for education. A full definition of sustainable development, that includes learning throughout life, can offer new perspectives for the creation of employment.<P>
<h3>II. <B>Principles and application of educational policies<P></h3>
</B>In all its consultations, the Commission observed the profound hopes placed on education. Some of these hopes relate, naturally, to very specific and legitimate functions of education in imparting knowledge and skills; on the other hand, rarely did we encounter a narrow, purely functional view of education. On the contrary, education is a means, both individual and collective, to fostering a more harmonious form of human development. Such a development, as I have already said, should rest on the fundamental dignity of each individual, and reduce poverty, exclusion, ignorance, oppression and war.<P>
<P>
We, the Commission, have a vision of learning that includes but goes beyond formal education. <B>Learning throughout life, </B>as we have called it, is not merely a slogan intended to encourage access to further training. It is a vision of education that begins with early childhood, and that aims at giving each individual the tools, during initial education, to continue learning and developing throughout life and in all aspects of human activity. Here, I must pay tribute to your countries, where there is a long history of commitment to expanding learning opportunities for all. I am pleased to come here to debate our report before representatives of countries that have a distinguished record of energetic and thoughtful reform, and that strive continuously to make education fulfill its potential for true equality of opportunity.<P>
<P>
The concept of learning throughout life takes on particular meaning today when patterns of life, and of the use of time, are changing extremely rapidly. The time spent in work over each individual lifetime has diminished by nearly one-third since the beginning of this century, from approximately one hundred thousand hours to seventy thousand. By the year two thousand twenty-five, projections have the number of hours worked in a lifetime down to forty thousand, at a time when life spans are increasing rapidly. Will we be able to propose to our citizens a creative distribution of their vastly increased free time, that includes leisure, community participation, and learning? Will we be able to meet the challenge of inventing and offering new patterns of work, learning and leisure that ensure continuous participation of each individual as a meaningful member of society? These are tremendous challenges for education and for educators. Clearly, they cannot be met by merely extending initial schooling, with its individual successes and failures. Clearly, we must find ways to make sure that the doors to learning<P>
<P>
Such a task will not be easy.<P>
<P>
<I>The four pillars of education<P>
<P>
</I>Keeping in mind the challenges posed by a commitment to human development, the Commission wished to propose a broad definition of the foundations and the aims of education. It proposes that education be constructed around four pillars: <B>learning to live together, learning to know, learning to do, and learning to be.<P>
</b>
<b>Learning to live together</b> means more than tolerating otherness. It means wishing to understand others, to live together in mutual respect. If we wish, through education, to learn to live together, we must reflect on the way in which history, geography, languages, philosophy are taught. We must examine the way in which the educational establishments themselves function and interact with the community. We must be aware of the importance of the example of teachers, whose function as role models is so important in the transmission of attitudes and values.<P>
<P>
The second pillar is <B>learning to know. </B>Today, this means more than acquiring a specific body of knowledge. It demands an approach to learning itself, understanding how to master the instruments for using knowledge, and how to exercise one's critical faculties, curiosity, and of course, memory.<P>
<P>
<B>Learning to do, </B>traditionally separated from &quot;learning to know&quot;, is of course not only concerned with the acquisition of skills, but also with the application of knowledge and with a set of competencies that are broadly termed &quot;life skills&quot;. It is here that early on, thinkers in the Scandinavian countries, such as Gr&uuml;ndtvig, R&uuml;denschold, and Salomon, to name only these, have shown the way. They, and others in the Nordic countries have constantly sought to link learning with doing. They have emphasized breaking down the barriers between intellectual and practical knowledge, by insisting on the need for all learners to undertake both intellectual and manual activities. In short, they laid the groundwork for belief in the benefits of a rounded education that is very much alive in your countries today.<P>
<P>
The fourth pillar, <B>learning to be, </B>is the title, and principal theme of the Commission that reported to UNESCO some twenty-five years ago, under the chairmanship of Edgar Faure. This noble concept is just as valid today as when it was coined: learning to be means <B>encouraging the fullest development of the creative potential of each individual, in all its richness and complexity. </B>In the words of one of our commissioners, education is first of all an inner journey, that leads to the construction of one's personality.<P>
<P>
These four pillars, then, aim to place on equal footing the development of the individual and the individual's place in society. They aim to emphasize the equal importance of the intellectual and the practical, and to break down what can be an excessive separation between the roie of the hand and the role of the mind. And, they should make clear our view that the &quot;inner journey&quot; of education must, to be complete, culminate in an understanding of one's relationship to others, that is in <B>learning to live together.<P>
<P>
</B>Our report gives great importance to the role of teachers. We felt that rehabilitating the nobility of the teaching profession, by enhancing the status, roles, and training of teachers, will justify the strong demands that a new concept of education will make on them. Yes, the world is changing, and there is no longer a monopoly of the classroom on learning. New media, new methods of communication, new types of learning opportunities - including learning by doing - are broadening the spectrum of learning possibilities. Education establishments and whole systems will have to integrate and take advantage of these new possibilities.<P>

<B>However, the teacher will still, in our view, remain central to learning. </B>Nothing will replace the interaction of personalities between learner and teacher: the awakening of curiosity, the testing of ideas or new knowledge, the value of example. And, changes to the overall education system will necessarily demand the consensus and participation of teachers.<P>
<P>
<I>From basic education to university:<P>
<P>
</I>What do our four pillars imply for education? They imply rethinking the sequences and time-frames of education. Demand for education is increasing all over the world, including in Europe. Changes in the employment structure make a unique period of initial education less and less adequate as preparation for life. More and more people will change professions several times over their lifetimes, and will alternate periods of paid employment with other types of activity. In view of these changes, what types of adjustments should we foresee in formal education?<P>
<P>
Although one could make a long catalogue of important issues surrounding the educational responses to the future, I should like to emphasize three areas:<P>
<P>
- the essential nature of <B>basic education, </B>including in countries with well developed systems;<P>
<P>

<P>
- the need to <B>diversify </B>both the content and the organization of <B>secondary education; </B>and,<P>
<P>
</B>- the importance of <B>higher education, its relationship to society </B>and to the rest of the educational system.<P>
<P>
<B>Basic education, </B>understood as the first cycle of education (including early childhood education), is where the attitudes towards learning are developed and where the tools for further learning are forged. UNESCO, along with UNICEF, UNDP and the World Bank, have raised awareness about the importance of expanding schooling to reach those 230 million children who today either never enter a primary school or do not complete the four years that is a minimum to retain the skills of literacy and numeracy. They have focused attention on the almost 900 million adult illiterates, most of them women, who very often remain marginalized because of their lack of basic life skills. They have made us aware of the fact that these 900 million adult illiterates are also those the most at risk of being unable to ensure that their children acquire complete basic education. But, these dramatic problems should not leave us, in Europe, satisfied because all of our children go to school. Many, we have only recently understood, still relapse into a state of functional illiteracy. Others, who may have special needs, get left behind early on, never to catch up, or leave the system prematurely, never to return. Equality of opportunity begins in early childhood, and much remains to be done to ensure it. The foundations of basic education include an emphasis on basic skills, but
also on learning languages, living democracy, working and learning in groups, linking school with the outside world.<P>
<P>
<B>Secondary education </B>is in many ways the most problematic of the sequences of our systems. It is the place where, today, the fate of many young people is decided.<P>
<P>
And yet, it is in secondary education that the most varied talents should emerge and flourish. It is crucial to keep constantly in mind the need to encourage diversity, to recognize and nurture all sorts of abilities and talents in young people at this level. In fact, no school system specifically aims to make all young people alike; yet the curricula, and methods of teaching and testing can have the effect of discouraging difference or experimentation.<P>
<P>
We shall have to increase our efforts to make secondary schooling more open and more diversified. Some young people benefit greatly from periods of work in between periods of formal schooling; others can choose a course of study only to return later to take up another path. Changes in the sequences and in the contents of learning at secondary level should enable us to break down the hierarchy between vocational and academic learning, to give second, third, fourth chances to everyone. Another approach would be trying to break down what can be a strict barrier between <B>professional teachers, </B>and others who can <B>teach about their professions. </B>This latter would, of course, require some negotiation and discussion with leachers' organizations.<P>
<P>
<B>Higher education, </B>with at its heart the university, is central to the development and spread of knowledge in any society. It has a potent influence on the rest of the system, by educating its teachers and managers, by developing the standards of acquisition of knowledge and excellence that rest of the system aspires to. In our report to the traditional three functions of higher education, that is, research and innovation, teaching and training, and continuing education or community service, we added an emphasis on international co-operation. In all of these four functions, universities will have to be deeply aware of the balance to be found between the pursuit of knowledge and excellence, and their relationship with society. Higher education is called upon to broaden its links with society, and this is perfectly justified. But the Commission would not wish this to be interpreted as a diminishing of the role of universities in carrying out research and in training researchers. These are essential tasks, both for society and for the survival of universities themselves.<P>
<P>
The links between universities and teacher training institutes needs to be strengthened. Access to higher education must be made freer for those who have not followed a linear path throughout the education system.<P>
<P>
And, universities must actively pursue one of their original functions, the free circulation of knowledge: it is our institutions of higher education that can provide the impetus for a greater co-operation between wealthy countries and poorer countries, by sharing information, by encouraging exchange, by developing new methods of research and training that can help develop endogenous capacity where it does not adequately exist.<P>
<P>

<h3>III. <B>Human resources in Europe<P></h3>

</B><I>Changing visions of human resources: from human capital to humanizing capital<P>
<P>
</I>The Commission's analysis and work over three years reinforced our conviction that, whatever the particular set of circumstances in a country or society, education is a priority. Whatever the economic or social difficulties, a long-term commitment to improving access, equity, and quality in education are investments that are essential for preserving the social fabric, for ensuring human dignity, and for economic progress.<P>
<P>
Let me be clear: we had no intention of trying to establish a correlation between education and unemployment. Massive unemployment in Europe is the product of a set of factors that I outlined in the <I>1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. </I>We must, in Europe, lay down the foundations for higher growth based on higher employment. This should be founded on a new model of development that takes into account key parameters, that is, protection of the environment, broader options for the distribution of time spent working, and also meeting new societal needs, particularly concerning services for people.<P>
<P>
And yet, in the economic climate of Europe today, it seems that we are losing sight of the long-term advantages on which we must build to preserve the future. We are a highly educated, highly skilled population. We need to preserve those advantages by improving the quality of training and of education, and by ensuring another chance for young people who have left education too early to be successful in the labour market. Indeed, elsewhere, the most successful of the emerging, powerful economies of Asia and Latin America have consistently invested in education over the last few years.<P>
<P>
To take the discussion one step further in Europe, the European Commission recently brought out a white paper, under the authority of Edith Cresson and P&aring;draig Flynn, entitled &quot;Teaching and Learning: Towards the Learning Society&quot;. Here, as in our report to UNESCO, the paper makes a plea for re-emphasizing the value of a broad general education. It stresses the importance of second chances for young people who leave school prematurely, and it speaks in favour of an education that develops attitudes and capacities that make people apt for the labour market.<P>
<P>
We are entering into a debate in Europe, on the relative emphasis to be placed on skilled labour and unskilled labour. Many thinkers feel that the future of Europe is in something called &quot;skilled&quot; labour, that is the knowledge-intensive jobs, those carried out by the so-called &quot;symbolic analysts&quot;. In such a view, training must emphasize competencies and aptitudes related to skilled work. This is clearly true as far as it goes. However, what sorts of skills can we define in relation to community work, to the service sector, where human relations are as much required as specific skills that are traditionally taught in classes? If we place all our emphasis on high-level skills, what kind of message are we sending those people who, inevitably, will do work that does not require these skills? By placing too much emphasis on the level of formally learned skills needed for work, are we not creating hierarchies that will be socially divisive, even explosive, over time? I think it is time to realize that, the search and need for education is not only a search for marketable skills, that the purpose of seeking to develop a learning society is not only that of providing skills for the economic marketplace.<P>
<P>
Thus, while the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment points to the need for Europe in the future to have an economy that is <B>healthy, open, decentralized, and competitive, </B>it also pleads for <B>solidarity. </B>This solidarity can come through economic measures, but it will also come through equal opportunity in education. It will come through investing in young people and giving each the additional chances that will enable him or her to achieve a rounded education based on the four pillars I have described above. It is thus that the central theme of our report, learning throughout life, takes on its full meaning.<P>
<P>
Europe must not relax its vigilance. We must respond to increasing demand for education: <B>earlier, longer, and for more people.<P></B>
<P>
<h3>IV. A <B>look at financing educational reform: a matter of political choice<P></h3>

</B>You will be asking yourselves, what will it cost to adapt education systems to this new vision? How can our education budgets, already strained, cope with new demands in terms of quality and quantity? There are, of course, no simple answers, and no single approach will be satisfactory for all situations.<P>
<P>
One principle is clear, however. Education is a public good that belongs to the whole of society. Thus, it is the whole of society that must benefit from education, and the whole of society that must participate in decisions about the major directions decided for educational policies. In particular, however each country resolves the equilibrium between public and private financing of education, it is essential to remember that choices about education are among the major political choices made by societies. The state has a fundamental responsibility for regulating the system, for trying to ensure the system as a whole offers both equity and excellence. Education systems, from the governmental point of view, are part of the overall vision each nation has of the way in which it ensures the welfare of all its citizens, linking education with the other measures of governments to provide equal opportunity and ensure fundamental human rights to all.<P>
<P>
Where cost-sharing schemes come into play, whether these be in the form of fees for schooling or higher education, or in opening up possibilities for private education, these must be accompanied by measures that allow for equality of opportunity for those who cannot pay. Much of the rest of the world can learn from your own experience with student loans. The Commission also favours broad decentralization of educational systems, which can encourage innovation, and in many cases more efficient use of public money.

<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Choices in education are societal choices and political choices, as I have said. The importance of these choices requires on-going debate: this means first of all, debate in parliaments, but also by local authorities, by citizens, and in educational systems. Although corrections will be needed, I think it important to state that continuous reform is wasteful and can be destructive of creative energy, resources and good will. A process of change that seeks to involve all &quot;stakeholders&quot; in teaching and learning is bound to lay more solid foundations for long-term improvement than &quot;top-down&quot; reform. Debate on education that involves a variety of actors is in itself a teaching and learning process, whereby the learners can also teach, and the teachers can show that they learn.<P>
<P>
If our report serves to inspire such debate, or at the very least to enrich it, it will have made a large step towards fulfilling the hopes that inspired its writing.<P>
<P>
I should not leave you without saying another word about international cooperation. The Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the need to intensify international co-operation, to increase funding for education and to increase the share of international aid that goes to education. Globalization, which has been an important theme in my remarks, has created both new tensions ~nd new opportunities. The tensions can only be managed and resolved, and the opportunities seized, if there is a continuing commitment to international co-operation. This commitment, whose fundamental premise is often underlined by the Director-General of UNESCO, is one of a search for enduring peace.<P>
