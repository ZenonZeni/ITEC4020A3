<P><FONT SIZE=+1 FACE=Courier New><DD><B>Allen Helmers smokes marijuana to relieve his pain.&nbsp;  Allen’s doctor says that "chronic neurogenic pain responds well to the medicinal use of marijuana ... causing much less side effects than the standard pain medications."&nbsp;  The state of Iowa gave Allen a criminal conviction for possession of 90 grams of marijuana, and now they want to revoke his probation because he refuses to stop smoking it!&nbsp;  The state of Iowa has the law on its side.&nbsp;  We have love and compassion.&nbsp;  The law must change!&nbsp;  Come and help us tell our story.&nbsp;  We meet at Noon on Sunday, October 6, 1996, on the West Steps of the State Capitol Building.&nbsp;  Be there!</FONT></B>
