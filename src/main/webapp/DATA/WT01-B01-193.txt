<H2>Surgeons Praise AESOP<BR>
</H2>

<P>
AESOP is used and endorsed by numerous surgeons, nurses, other OR personnel and hospital
administrators.  Here is a sampling of supportive testimony received from a wide variety
of individuals who use AESOP in their daily practice.</P>

Head of Endourology Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia.</B>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;I have found that AESOP gives the surgeon more control
of the operative (laparascopic) fields while providing steady
and precise visualization of the area being examined. It cuts
the operative team in laparoscopy to a maximum of two. I also
find it untiring and it does not complain.&quot;</I> <BR>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;What I most appreciate about AESOP is the steady
picture. Another great advantage is that it allows for more direct
surgeon control. The elimination of one assistant in the OR, freeing
them to provide more sophisticated patient services is an added
plus.&quot;</I> <BR>

Surgery Service, Chairman Endoscopic Surgery Committee, Piedmont
Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.</B> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;I consider AESOP to be an important tool in the Operating
Room because it allows me to use my left hand to operate, holds
the camera still and allows more room for the surgeon to operate
during a lap nissen. AESOP eliminates the need for an additional
person in the OR and, over time, it saves money.&quot;</I> <BR>

New York Downtown Hospital, New York, New York.</B> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;After in-servicing, we found AESOP easy to set up
and use. The image is steady at all times, without the shifting,
rotations, etc., that are common when the laparoscope is held
by hand. We have been able to eliminate the need for a second
assistant at the OR table to hold the camera. This means more
room around the operating table and will result in significant
savings. I think that it is a significant advancement in laparoscopic
surgical technology and I am pleased that it is available to surgeons
at New York Downtown Hospital.&quot;</I> <BR>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;Robotic technology is probably under-utilized and
under-appreciated by most clinicians. AESOP is a fine example
of how we can utilize developments and accomplishments in other
disciplines to enhance activities in our own specialty.&quot;

<br>
<LI><B>Harriman H. Jett, MD, FACS, General Surgeon, Carolina Surgical
clinic of Charlotte, P.A., Charlotte, North Carolina.</B>
<BR> 
<BR>
<LI><I>&quot;I have found the AESOP robotic arm extremely valuable
in the performance of my laparoscopic surgical procedures in that
I have complete control over the field of view without having
to verbalize any command to an assistant. The image that is being
visualized is also perfectly still with the exception of the patient's
heartbeat and rhythmic respirations. This lack of outside-induced
motion allows much more precision with my surgery. The quality
of what I am seeing also does not vary from case to case inasmuch
as I have complete control over the system and variations are
not produced by various human assistants with varying technical
skills.<BR>
<BR>
<I>&quot;With the AESOP robotic arm, my laparoscopic surgery requires
only one sterile assistant to handle the instruments. This is
very important in this era of medicine when &quot;cost savings&quot;
have cut down the available staffing in the operating room. There
is a short learning curve to become familiar with the controls
but as soon as these skills are acquired, then operation of AESOP
becomes essentially automatic.&quot;<BR>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;The robot frees up the surgeon's hand so he can operate
with it instead of holding the scope. Also, AESOP is very difficult
to distract.&quot;<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;I have found AESOP to be a distinctive advantage
in the operating room. It frees an arm of the surgeon, or assistant,
to enable surgery more easily, the picture is steadier than when
held by hand, and the programmable positions are very convenient.
I do not like having to operate without this wonderful piece of
technology.&quot;<BR>

Hospital, Glendale, California.</B> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI><I>&quot;AESOP can also reduce eye strain from having to follow
a motion picture, since it holds the scope stationary. It also
may reduce the need for an assistant for some surgeries.&quot;</I>
