SETBACK FOR JAPAN'S N-PROGRAMME AFTER MONJU ACCIDENT

Japan's nuclear power programme, the most ambitious in the world, is
facing major repercussions following a major accident at the site of
the country's 280 MW Monju fast-breeder experimental reactor.

While the accident itself was severe - involving the leakage of sodium-
based coolant - and could have led to a near catastrophic series of
events, what is more worrisome was the slow reaction of the operators
and of other officials associated with the FBR programme.

Their subsequent efforts to `cover up' many details of the accident,
which involved the reactor's secondary coolant system, has led the
Japanese news media, the Fukui prefectural government and others to
engage in bitter criticism of the way the national government handles
its comprehensive nuclear energy policy.

For example, Yasuoki Urano, director-general of the Science and
Technology Agency (STA), said he was extremely angry about false
reports given by Monju's operator.

The coverup involved withholding segments of video footage showing the
extensive damage to pipe structures caused by leakage of the sodium
coolant, which itself was the result of an apparent faulty pipe weld.

Located in Tsuruga, Fukui prefecture, Monju is the heart of a
controversy over Japan's use of plutonium and the government's step-by-
step development scheme focusing on eventual construction and use of
commercial fast-breeder reactors.

Indeed, Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, said in a
December 24 editorial: "Outrage and concern over the handling of the
attempted cover up are brought to light. Unless `Donen' (the operator)
changes, it cannot be entrusted with nuclear development in which
safety is most crucial."

The Yomiuri Shimbun is well-known as an advocate of further development
of nuclear power projects, unlike some other Japanese newspapers, so an
editorial on its pages is to be seen as particularly damaging to the
programme.

Because Monju is fuelled by plutonium, the leakage of about three
tonnes of sodium-compound coolant on December 8 could have been much
more severe. The daily coverage in the media in Japan of the accident's
severity (which was only made known in bits and pieces), the falsifying
of details, and the slow response of officials to admit problems, may
in turn result in a drastic re-examination of Japan's policies vis-a-
vis the use of plutonium.

The country had planned to start utilising some plutonium in the form
of mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) in as many as 10 BWRs and PWRs by around 2000-
2002. This is viewed as an effective way to use up some plutonium, so
as to prevent Japan from having an excess amount in storage - which
would make neighbouring countries nervous.

But that plan, which is overseen by the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI), could be delayed considerably because of fresh
concerns over safety.

There are implications too for the long-term nuclear programme. The
Institute of Energy Economics predicts that Japan should have 75-90 GW
of nuclear power by 2020 and 90 GW-110 GW by 2030. This estimate,
regarded as phenomenal in most nuclear circles, stems from a recent
projection study funded by the STA.

At present, Japan has 39.6 GW of nuclear capacity in 50 operating
reactors with another four under construction or near commissioning.
There are already problem of where to site new reactors.  Also
troublesome is the history of Monju with construction delays, cost
overruns, postponements in starting operations due to equipment
problems, and assorted other headaches.

Last March, a problem with a steam control device was found, and in
June a software-related problem cropped up. Monju had been generating
power since late August, and it had been scheduled to begin full power
tests at the end of the year.

The Nuclear Safety Commission, an independent entity affiliated with
the Science and Technology Agency, is now investigating the accident
and the series of events following the detection of the sodium compound
leak.  On the day of the accident, it took eight minutes for the head
operator of the Monju to get in contact with the "division chief" to
ask permission to shut down the plant, which was operating at about 40%
of output.

The Leakage was detected at 7:47 p.m. on December 8 and the shutdown
did not start until 8 p.m. Late last month, after this detail came to
light, Hiroshi Oishi, head of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel
Development Corp (PNC), admitted that the delay in shutting down the
reactor - due to the intricate chain of command hierarchy - was,
indeed, a problem. Oishi also admitted that this delay was itself among
the contributing causes to the lag in reporting the accident to the
local municipality.

Meanwhile, the Fukui prefectural government has issued a report late
last month that prohibits Monju from being restarted.without strict
guarantees that accident safeguards are fully implemented by the PNC.
These safeguards focus mainly on leak detection systems and emergency
procedures. That report came out about the same time that the STA
revised a report on the accident.

The STA had to get the PNC to revise the report because PNC's initial
version contained falsified data. Included in the corrections was a
revised time of the first inspection of the accident site (7 a.m.,
December 9) rather than the earlier stated time (10 p.m. the night
before). PNC dismissed four officials associated with Monju, including
one of the directors in charge of operations. "Dismissed" means they
will still be employed by PNC, though at other sites.

Fukui governor Yukio Kurita went so far as to say that the citizens of
Fukui feel "betrayed because of PNC's deceptions." Fukui prefecture has
a total of 15 nuclear reactors, most of which are operated by Osaka-
based Kansai Electric Power Co.

MITI Vice-Minister Tomio Tsutsumi said that MITI was instructing all
power utilities to enhance their training of operators and inspection
processes as well as speed up reporting of accidents to relevant
authorities. His comments were made in direct response to the Monju
accident.

Monju is slated to serve as the technical foundation for a `pre-
commercial' or `demonstration' FBR, which would be followed by
commercial FBRs, according to the government's long-term nuclear energy
development plan. However, critics contend that the post-Monju plant
will be exceedingly expensive and that electric power utilities are not
interested in building and operating commercial FBRs until sometime
after 2030. The Monju accident will definitely have an impact on this
schedule.

It could also create extensive hardships for planners seeking to find a
construction site for the post-Monju reactor. MITI's Agency of Natural
Resources and Energy (ANRE) and other government groups will do their
best to secure such a site, which requires local approval. But in the
wake of the Monju accident that will be a significant challenge.

Additionally, the accident will affect the outlook on the nuclear fuel
reprocessing facility now under construction at Rokkasho-mura, Aomori
prefecture. The planned measures to ensure the safety of that plant,
which will handle spent fuel and plutonium, will likely have to be
enhanced. And that plant will be subject to greater oversight from
local authorities fearing the possibility of the whitewashing similar
to that occurring after Monju's sodium leakage. Aomori has sent
officials to Fukui to investigate first hand the accident and the
subsequent cover up.

Because the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FERC) decided in
July 1995 to cancel the government-led project to construct a plutonium-
burning advanced thermal reactor (ATR) in Aomori prefecture, mainly due
to escalating cost projections, the FBR programme itself may be subject
to greater cost-related scrutiny and other kinds of analysis. Expanding
pressure on utilities to reduce costs - so as to slash rate structures
- is causing power utility executives to look more closely at all areas
where cost-cutting rationalisation can be applied.

One serious after-effect of the Monju accident is that the Fukui
prefectural government has stated that it will delay making a decision
to allow Japan Atomic Power Co. to build two more reactors in the
Tsuruga area. And, as for the time that will be needed to repair
Monju's equipment, some estimates are in the range of two years, if
extensive redesign work is required.

COMPANIES TURN UP HEAT FOR 3 GORGES FUNDING

Western companies are starting to turn up the heat on their development
agencies to ensure they do not miss out on the a piece of the action in
the world's biggest hydroelectric project at Three Gorges on China's
Yangtze River.

The focal point is in the US where it had been understood, unofficially
at least, that US companies could not count on any support from the
Export-Import Bank in their efforts to win power equipment deals at the
high dam project deep in central China, 1,500 km from Shanghai. This
stemmed largely from the Clinton Administration's long dispute with
China over human rights abuses and the more pertinent issue of the
massive dislocation of people affected by the construction of the
17,500 MW-plus complex and the creation of a huge reservoir downriver
from Chongqing.

It is predicted that well over 1m people will be dislocated by the
project, and it is not thought that Beijing will overly concern itself
with how smooth this exodus will be. The estimated value of the project
is now becoming stratospheric and has been put at around $24bn. The
project, in totality,  could be completed by 2009, but is likely to be
finished sometime in the second decade. First power would come on line
early in the next century.

Recent developments suggest that the Eximbank is now yielding to
congressional and private sector lobby pressure to do what it is
supposed to do - back US exports. It became known recently that a
National Security Council interagency committee had concluded that US
government finance should not be made available to such a controversial
project.

However, the caution to Exim by the administration was carefully
worded. In a letter last September from Samuel Berger, deputy assistant
to the president for national security, the NSC said it would be
"unwise" for the government (of which Exim is an agency) should align
itself with the scheme because of environmental and human rights
concerns and should note the legal problems that might arise from any
decision to provide assistance. But also the government should
"refrain" from publicly condemning the project. "Such a condemnation
would unduly strain bilateral relations." In conclusion, the government
should take a low profile on the Three Gorges project for fear of
harming other US trade and investment interests in China.

The reference to  legal problems appears connected with threats by many
environmental agencies contemplating court action against Exim should
it change its mind.

This will pose a major challenge for Martin Kamark, a Washington
lawyer, named last week to succeed Kenneth Brody as chairman of the
institution. Kamarck's wife, Elaine, is a senior policy advisor to vice-
president Al Gore, which suggests he will be under pressure to tow the
Administration's line rather than that of private sector interests.

Nevertheless, as he prepared for his new position - he is already vice-
chairman - news reports last week from the US indicated that the White
House is putting some distance between itself from its earlier advice
to Exim to stay away from Three Gorges. American companies such as
Caterpillar, Rotec and Voith Hydro have applied for $500m in loans from
Exim. General Electric made clear two years ago that it would
aggressively pursue opportunities to cash in on the project's
requirements for up to 16 foreign-manufactured turbine generators for
the dam's power houses.

The concerns of US industry are real enough for it is mainly the US -
and until a year or so ago Canada - that has allowed itself to moralise
about the project. No such worries as yet bedevil the British, French,
German or Japanese governments, whose companies are now positioning
themselves to chase for business, either through direct negotiation or
in competitive tender. China is still thought to be the big
infrastructure order-book prize in Asia, despite its  inarticulate
foreign investment policies, which are still undergoing revisions.

Analysts do concede, however, that the attempted use of foreign aid by
other countries to support Three Gorges - at least in its early stages
- will arouse similar controversy because of the strength of the
international environmental lobby. The British government was badly
burned by the use of concessional finance to back the Malaysian Pergau
Dam scheme; and the Japanese foot-dragged on supporting the World
Bank's now-aborted backing for the Nepal Arun III project.

US companies have noted Canada's `Damascene' conversion to the the
project. When in opposition, Jean Chretien's Liberal Party condemned
the Tory government's support for Three Gorges, but when in power, it
changed its tune - most notably in November 1993 when Chretien, now
Prime Minister, visited China. Said one observer, "He saw the future,
and it was wet."

Chretien has since given the Canadian Export Development Corp.,
Canada's version of the US Exim Bank, the green light to provide export
credits to back Canadian involvement in Three Gorges. Some of the major
regional utilities, full of hydropower expertise but sensitive to the
resettlement issue, are on record as eschewing support for the scheme,
such as BC Hydro and Ontario Hydro. Indeed, BCH's ex-chief executive,
Maurice Strong, is an environmentalist and is now an adviser to the
World Bank's new president James Wolfensohn.

Significantly,  last year Monenco Agra, an engineering consultant, won
a $34.5m contract to provide a computer system to co-ordinate the
Three Gorges resettlement. EDC support of $12.5m has since been
mobilised; indeed, the EDC had already provided $23.5m in finance and
cover to help Dominion Bridge build a cement plant in China, whose
output will be used on the dam.

The existence of a Canadian option is seen as a benefit to those US
companies - of which there are many - with subsidiaries in Canada.
Rotec has indicated it might look to the EDC if Exim backing is not
available.

Solid opposition to the scheme still lies with the environmental
groups. Probe International in Canada has taken some relish at
lampooning Chretien's volte face on the issue. In the US, Human Rights
Watch/Asia has attacked the Beijing government for its suppression of
open debate or, indeed, any criticism of the project.

It reinforced this with publication of  report detailing a devastating
account of two Chinese dam collapses in August 1975, which took the
lives of at least 85,000 and possibly as many as 230,000, but news of
which was hushed up by the government. US International Rivers Network
has added its weight to the chorus of disapproval for the scheme.

Further critiques in the past few years have come in the form of two
publications, Yangtze! Yangtze! by Dai Qing; and Damming the Three
Gorges, edited by Margaret Barber and Grainne Ryder and issued by
Toronto-based Probe.

Among the multilateral aid agencies, the lobby groups appear to have
had success in garnering fairly cohesive  support for their anti-Three
Gorges stance. The World Bank last year took the circumspect view that,
as it had not been asked by China, it could not support Three Gorges.
Under its new president, James Wolfensohn, who is pushing the Bank to
demand greater accountability and signs of commerciality among borrower
nations, this policy towards Three Gorges is now: `if asked, the answer
is no.' Wolfensohn, it should be noted, is a close friend of President
Clinton.

The Bank's view is shared by the Asian Development Bank. Both the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank (See ADB feature this issue) feel
they are putting plenty of money into China for power projects - some
of them hydro - without getting involved in anything so pregnant with
controversy.

But much schizophrenia still attends the scheme.

In a recent article in Foreign Affairs, the authoritative US bimonthly
publication, writer Audrey Topping noted:

"Estimates of the project's cost range between $17.3bn and $30bn. To
help defray this, the government has been seeking $8bn in foreign
investment. The World Bank, after overseeing a four-year, $8.7m
feasibility study conducted (in the 1980s) by the Canadian
International Development Agency, refused to help with funding.

"Merrill Lynch and other potential investors have also withdrawn
because of the financial and political risks, as well as questions of
human rights violations."

In Hong Kong, Merrill's Robert Graves, senior vice-president for
marketing and communications, last week told Power in Asia: "Merrill
Lynch has never been mandated to work on behalf of or for the Chinese
government regarding the Three Gorges Dam project, nor has any other
foreign bank as far as I know. There have been a lot of rumours in the
past that we were involved, but we never have been approached."

This does not tally with the fact that in 1993 Merrill Lynch,
describing itself as a leading international financial intermediary for
China, published a sponsored statement in the western media providing a
balanced analysis of Three Gorges, explaining the dam's irrigation,
agricultural and power generation benefits while explaining the scope
of the relocation and rehabilitation problem. Said the article:

"Financing for the project, officially estimated at $10bn, will come
from worldwide sources. Merrill Lynch has been working with the Beijing
government to develop the financing plan, which could include bond
offerings.

"Equity financing could account for as much as 50% of the financing in
the early construction stages, and there is also likely to be a
significant amount of strategic partnership investment from
international sources. . . ."

Whatever Merrill's involvement in Three Gorges is, or was, the fact
remain that the project is now  beginning to gear up.

In recent weeks, Shi Dazhen, China's Power Industry Minister, announced
plans for the creation of a nationwide power grid, which could treble
current capacity. This grid was being planned around Three Gorges, and
is aimed at integrating regional and provincial power grids.

Speaking at the annual conference of the country's power industry, Shi
said that the capacity of installed generators, which is now nearly 210
GW, should rise to 300 GW by 2000 and 550 GW-600 GW by 2010, a
breathtaking scenario.

Even more important was the need to boost output. By 2000, he said,
output will have risen to 1.4 trillion kWh, up from 1 trillion kWh in
1995. A total of 170,000 km of power lines capable of handling 220 kV
of power and more will have been installed by then.

Three Gorges will be a centrepiece of the expansion programme. A high
voltage power transmission system will carry power generated by Three
Gorges to other parts of the country. A new company will be set up to
carry out the task.

Added to this will be a nationwide power network to link the grids in
the central and eastern parts of Sichuan province, followed by other
provinces and autonomous regions. Further, a total of 19 major
hydropower schemes and six pumped storage plants will be constructed in
the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and three other rivers.

This all-embracing plan also calls for power grids in 35 key cities to
be rehabilitated and for coal-fired and hydropower generators to be
renovated, and increased use of less toxic fuels such as liquified coal
or gas.

In Beijing last month, China Securities, a business publication, called
on China to issue bonds in overseas markets to meet a shortfall in
funds for the project. They should then use the hard currency raised to
fill part of an expected Yn50bn shortfall. The article said that China
could provide only Yn200bn of the estimated Yn250bn ($30bn).

According to observers in Hong Kong, there are increasing signs that
China is paying attention to international opinion. "They have to if
they want any really helpful foreign finance, be it commercial lending
or export credits," said one banker.  In addition, officials from the
Three Gorges Development Group explained that China planned to set up a
life insurance company to provide policies to those being resettled.

The officials said that an application had been sent to the central
bank, with an approval expected by 1996. The so-called Three Gorges
Life Insurance Co, will be headquartered in Beijing with offices
located closer to the site.

BLACKOUTS HAMMER INDIA'S ECONOMIC OUTPUT

India is reeling under one of the worst onslaughts of power shortages
in living in memory. The current crisis is reaching national
proportions and has been mounting in intensity for about three months.

According to power officials, the source of the problems stems from the
country's failure to reach its power project installation targets,
inadequate rainfall hampering hydropower generation, continued coal
shortages for a variety of reasons and what has been described as
`inter-grid indiscipline.'  The government in the southern state of
Andhra Pradesh has recently increased power cuts to high tension
industrial customers to between 40% and 60% of their sanctioned loads
above 70 kVa. Restrictions on peak hour consumption for industrial
consumers and five-hour supply cuts daily for household consumers are
facets of the acute power crisis in the state.

According to officials, there is a ban on power consumption for booking
or water heating in houses and on the use of neon signs at shops and on
billboards. Street lighting is even being restricted to alternate
poles.

The curtailment has come just at the end of an earlier power
restriction regime, eased briefly with the belated arrival of monsoon
rains which boosted reservoir levels.

The problem in AP state, however, is being greeted with widespread
scepticism, particularly by business consumers who believe the
government is protecting  the agricultural community at their expense.
The rationale is that the rural vote is too delicate to be tampered
with by the Telgu Desam Party, particularly in an election year.
Therefore urban customers are being made to bear the lion's share of
the power cut regime.

For example, the government is maintaining a certain minimum level of
water in Srisailam reservoir for release to the newly constructed Telgu
Ganga canal system to provide irrigation facilities for the farmers in
the Rayalaseema region. This has resulted in the closure of the
Srisailam hydropower station and the loss of 770 MW of capacity.

Indeed, it is to maintain the promised daily nine hours power supply
for irrigation pumpsets that other consumers are having to take it on
the chin. AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu explained to the
legislative assembly that only 4,295 MW power was available in December
against peak demand of 5,219 MW.

In neighbouring Karnataka state, a 50% cut for high tension consumers
and the 30% cut in supply for all low tension commercial, industrial
and non-industrial consumers since late October has led to a power
supply crisis never seen before, say officials.

One stop-gap is a proposal for three barge-mounted generating units
with a total of 400 MW of capacity, which could be delivered within six
months of the issue of letters of intent. If the deal goes through, it
will be some kind of record in a country renowned for its bureaucracy
and slow approvals system - one of the reasons for the power crisis.

Karnataka's problem is that it is 65% reliant on hydropower; this
year's monsoon has been late, leaving Linganamakki, Supta and Mani dam
reservoirs half empty. In Kerala state, the fast depletion of hydro
reservoirs is prompting a similar requirement for belt-tightening.

AP and Karnataka states are also suffering from a long strike by a
majority of workers in the Singareni Colliers Co. (SCCL) coal mines,
which has been going on since mid-October.

The virtual halt of coal supplies from the SCCL mines in AP has hit the
Ramagundam power station operated by the National Thermal Power Corp
(2,000 MW) and Karnataka's only coal-fired unit at Raichur. Generation
dropped to just 600 MW at Ramagundam as daily coal supplies went down
to 20,000 tonnes against 35,000 tonnes normally required.  The NTPC is
being persuaded to pay in advance for the coal in order to generate
between Rs400m-Rs450m required to meet the wage arrears of the striking
workers of the financially-troubled SCCL.

Coal problems are also hitting APSEB. The state utility has called for
offers for 500,000t of imported coal, but has delayed an actual order
placement. The imported coal will cost about Rs2,900 per tonne, very
expensive compared with the Rs700-Rs800 per tonne for domestic coal.
Financially the board is unable to pick up the estimated Rs1.50bn
($42m) bill for the imported coal. The transmission constraints stand
in the way of wheeling surplus power from the eastern region.

The coal authorities, as in the past, hardly admit any supply shortages
by its enterprises, despite the outcry but its customers. Two 250 MW
units at Dahanu power station, operated by the private sector BSES
Ltd., are operating much below capacity due to low supplies from
domestic mines controlled by government enterprises.

But Coal Minister Jagdish Tyler explained to the parliament last month
that the coal companies had supplied 115.8mt of coal to the power
stations in the April-November period, achieving 99.45% of the target.

The reason, then, for the low stocks at the power stations could be
excess consumption of coal by them, constraints in unloading coal from
railway wagons at the power houses and constraints in the movement of
coal. not to mention the perennial problem of non-delivery because of
non-payment of bills by power generators.

As for transmission problems, three major grid disturbances in the
western region in the past few months have led to blackouts and have
prompted much doubting about whether the region is any better off than
other regions of the country. More rude shocks are expected.

For example,  R. Chandramuli, Tata Electric Companies V-P, has warned
that the Bombay metropolis is facing a virtual grid collapse on a daily
basis. Bombay is accustomed to uninterrupted power supplies but
supplies were hit on December 9.

N.A. Joshi, Maharashtra State Electricity Board member/technical,
thinks the state will have power shortages and breakdowns until a new
500 MW unit at Chandrapur goes on line in mid-1997. With peak demand at
8,300 MW and availability at 7,700 MW, the state is at present
witnessing about 600 MW shortage.

At the same time, the perpetual overdraw by the Madhya Pradesh state by
200 MW-500 MW from central power stations at Korba and Vindhyachal has
deepened the shortages in Maharashtra.

This is an example of grid indiscipline, and has led to a dip in the
minimum level of frequency of power resulting in tripping of power
generating stations all over the region.

Factories in Gujarat in northwest India have recorded up to 80
trippings a month since the end of summer. Even continuous process
industries in the state are reeling under a 25% cut in power supply.

"These cuts and supply shortfall will undermine our efforts to make
Gujarat the premier state in the country for industrial investment,"
rues Grish Dani, the president of the Gujarat chamber of commerce, in
reference to some 20% investment injection attracted by the state since
1991. The current shortfall has been estimated by industrialists at
1,500 MW.

ADB NEPAL DEAL SETS OUT POWER PRIORITIES

A $125m loan that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was due to approve
in 1997 for a hydro project in Kali Gandaki, Nepal, will now be brought
before ADB's board this year, Arun Adarkar, Director of ADB's recently
inaugurated North American Office told Power in Asia in the course of
an interview.

The decision to "accelerate" the Kali Gandaki project was taken because
of Nepal's "new circumstances", explains Adarkar - notably, last year's
cancellation of Nepal's biggest ever hydro scheme - the 210 MW Arun III
run-of-river scheme - when the World Bank withdrew its $175m support
for the scheme.

Adarkar, an Indian national, who was ADB secretary in Manila from 1985-
1991, and a senior advisor in the Southeast Asia and Pacific Department
of the International Monetary Fund before assuming his present post in
Washington DC in May, denies that ADB's decision means ADB is taking up
the slack in power lending in Nepal, or indeed, anywhere else in Asia,
because the World Bank is reducing its support for the sector, or, in
the case of Arun III, completely pulling out.

The Kali Gandaki project is not "a replacement" for Arun III, and nor
is it in "the same geographical area", says Adarkar.

Notwithstanding World Bank lending for power in South Asia is
shrinking.  Between 1986 and 1990 such lending averaged $999m a year.
But between 1991-1995 it had almost halved to $474m a year average.

On the other hand, World Bank lending for power in East Asia and the
Pacific - a region that now includes six economies in transition:
Cambodia, China, Laos, Mongolia, Mynamar and Vietnam - is increasing.
World Bank loans for the power sector in this region averaged $662m a
year from 1986 to 1990 but they almost doubled to $1bn a year average
from 1991 to 1995.

As for the ADB at December 31 1994 it had lent a total of $10.2bn for
power generation, distribution and transmission projects, and over $60m
for related technical assistance/advice.  ADB's borrowing countries
comprise the developing countries of South and East Asia and the
Pacific and some of the newly independent states of the former Soviet
Union, such as Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.

Adarkar says ADB's projected lending for energy projects generally (oil
and gas as well as for power) will average $4.8bn a year from January 1
1995 to December 31 1997, which is a big increase compared with ADB's
lending in the sector during the previous three years.  Roughly two-
thirds of this projected lending will be for the power sector.

The ADB Director noted that the biggest borrower by far now and in the
foreseeable future is China, a relatively new ADB client.  ADB loans to
China for power over the 1995-1997 period will total $1.8bn, says
Adarkar.  In second place, comes Indonesia ($787m total projected power
sector lending), followed by the Phillipines ($544m).

The ADB is also just beginning to do business or is renewing business
with many other countries in the region.  For instance loans for power
projects amounting to $100m, $35m and $25m are due to be disbursed to
Mongolia, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic respectively during the
1995-1997 period, while loans to Vietnam to rehabilitate its power
sector are projected to total $140m during the period, ADB only renewed
lending to Vietnam in 1993.

Among ADB's traditional borrowers, Pakistan will continue to be an
important client, says Adarkar, with projected loans for the power
sector between 1995 and 1997 of $300m.

However, India which used to be a big power sector borrower in the
past, now borrows more from ADB for gas.  Total gas sector lending by
ADB to India was $560m in 1993, for instance.  Adarkar reckons, even if
ADB, the World Bank and other development institutions pooled all their
power sector loans for southern and eastern Asia and the Pacific, these
would still not be nearly enough to satisfy the region's massive
estimated $45bn a year sector requirements during the 1990s.

The massive investment needs reflect both specific and general factors.
 Specific failings are that all too often too close a relationship
exists between the functions of power utilities and government in the
region, with the result that the financial management and structuring
of utilities is often not transparent; accounting is inefficient; and
due to unrealistic pricing, and tariffs not matching the real costs of
supply, the utilities' debt servicing is now so onerous that the
utilities cannot go on expanding to meet forecast demand in the 1990s
in the way they did in the 1980s.

Nor can the State bail the utilities out at a time when budget cutting,
controlling inflation and other public investments, for instance in
health and education, are priorities.  As a result, electricity
shortages, power outages and brownouts are common across the region.

Indeed, according to ADB, per capita electricity consumption in Asian
developing countries in now just 500 kWh compared with 6,600 kWh in
OECD countries, and per capita installed capacity is 0.1 KW compared
with 1.9 KW in the OECD.

On top of this, inefficiencies in the generation, delivery and use of
electricity causes serious losses.  Total system losses among ADB
borrowing countries range from 25% to 35% compared with what ADB
considers acceptable loss levels of 15% to 18%.Furthermore, much of the
expansion carried out in the power sector in the 1980s in the region
was done without considering the environmental impact.

The general reasons for the huge capital investment requirements at
least in East Asia are due to under-investment in the past, acute
problem in Vietnam, Laos, Mongolia, Cambodia and the Philippines; rapid
urbanisation (even if the current urban growth rate of 4% a year in the
region slows down more than 1bn people will be living in towns in the
next generation); rising global competition; and dramatically high
economic growth.

East Asia has been the fastest growing region in the world for 25
years.  During the next decade the region is projected to grow at 7% -
8% a year.  One consequence of this huge growth is that the demand for
power has also greatly increased, raising investment requirements.

The need to promote private sector investment is vital.  The gap
between the demand for large-scale financing in the 1990s in the
sector, and what governments and development banks can provide, may
only be bridged by private investment.

So a top priority of ADB's work says Adarkar is helping countries
create the conditions that make private investors participation in the
sector appealing.

The countries ADB lends to are far from homogeneous.  They include
newly industrialised, industrialising, developing and land-locked or
island economies.  Not surprisingly, different nations apply different
sets of reforms in the sector , and are more successful in some areas
than others.

Consider reforms that are indispensable for attracting private
investment in the sector - establishing an appropriate legal and
regulatory framework; putting an end to monopolistic practices by
allowing competition in the generation, transmission and/or
distribution ends of the business; and laying the basis for sound
management in public utilities by restructuring them into autonomous
corporate entities.

Such reforms have been successfully implemented in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Korea, and Thailand in particular, says Adarkar.  In Thailand the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority of Bangkok, and the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) are "models" of government-
owned utilities that are "efficiently managed, enjoy considerable
autonomy, and have a good credit rating", he says.

In many other countries in the region, pending institutional reforms
and/or the privatisation of state-owned power companies, governments
have invited the private sector to invest in independent power projects
often under build-own-transfer (BOT) arrangements.

According to these, the private sponsor finances the building and
operating of power plants while the state-owned public utility
undertakes to buy the electricity under take or pay contracts.

The best example of this approach says the ADB Director, is the
Philippines.  Most electricity distribution was already privately-owned
in the Philippines when the country introduced laws allowing the
private sector to participate in power generation as well as under BOO
and BOT options.

As a result, Japanese, Hong Kong, American and European investors are
currently developing more than 6,000 MW of new generation capacity,
which has relieved Manila of t he daily eight hour brownouts it used to
endure.  Multilateral institutions estimate by 1998 as much as 80% of
national generating capacity could be in private hands in the
Philippines compared to none in 1991.  Meanwhile establishing sound
management in public utilities - essential if the utilities are to
attract private investment - may start with small reforms like selling
a minority of the utilities' stock to the public, (so that they become
more independent from the government), or farming out tasks like
maintenance, and the billing of customers, to the private sector.
Eventually, public utilities need to be allowed to issue bonds and
shares on capital markets to raise long-term finance.

"But most important of all", emphasises the ADB Director," the public
utilities should be allowed to introduce appropriate pricing policies
so that the prices or tariffs they charge reflect the real costs of
supply".  Inappropriate pricing policies for electricity supplies is "a
major problem" among ADB borrowers, Adarkar adds.  "In India, Pakistan
and China, pricing distortions are the  biggest.  Thailand is an
exception".

As for subsidies to the power sector, ADB is pushing borrowers to phase
them out, and to minimise any cross-subsidisation that may exist, of
rural/agricultural consumers by urban/industrial consumers.

A second priority is to make the system work more efficiently by
reducing supply side losses, and encouraging governments to introduce
demand-side management programmes.  The latter is expedient, says
Adarkar.  Studies in the US and Europe conclusively show that it costs
far less to reduce demand by a KW of electricity than it does to add a
KW of generation.

The third power sector priority is making sure the system does not
damage the environment.  For example, ADB has not ever been involved in
the financing of nuclear power plants.  However when it comes to having
a preference for run-of-river over dam-cum reservoir projects, or for
hydro projects over retrofitting of thermal plants to improve the
efficiency of power delivery and reduce pollution, Adarkar says," for
the Bank these options are not contrasting".

"We may do both", he adds.  "It might be necessary in order to expand
capacity to invest in a hydro project.  But at the same time and in the
same country we might help finance retrofitting of a thermal scheme".

All projects financed by ADB are assessed for their environmental
impact and may be redesigned or even discarded if the environmental
impact is found to be too adverse, or cannot be mitigated.  It also
actively encourages borrowers to use clean coal technologies (when
economically viable).

Coal is the primary source of energy in countries that are ADB's
biggest borrowers (eg: China).  And the Bank also provides technical
assistance to countries to help them evaluate the economic
possibilities of developing solar, mini hydro and wind energy options
to meet the demand for electricity in remote/rural areas.

RUSSIAN GROUP LOI FOR TEHRI HYDROPOWER EQUIPMENT

A letter of intent (LOI) has been issued to the Ukrainian-Russian
Energomach consortium for the supply of electro-mechanical equipment
for the phase one segment of the 1,000 MW hydropower project in Uttar
Pradesh.

The deal has an estimated value of Rs3bn ($85.7m), but has been in
limbo for a long time as the Tehri Hydro Development Corp (THDC)
insisted on a performance guarantee from an international bank which
the consortium could not arrange. The corporation now has agreed to
accept the guarantee from the Russian government, and the guarantee
terms are now being drafted.

The consortium includes Russian companies Energomach, Leningrad Metal
Works and Hydro Project Institute, as well as the Ukrainian groups of
Turbatom and Usal Electrotyzamash. The Tehri dam project was to be
funded earlier by the former Soviet Union.

The 4 x 250 MW first phase Tehri project is now scheduled for
completion in 2000 if the THDC does not get entangled in any more
rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R) problems, which have caused
delays.

Time overruns have increased the per-megawatt cost to Rs33m from a mere
Rs330,000 as originally planned in the 1970s. The THDC had announced in
late November a new R&R package for those being uprooted from old Tehri
town by the construction of the dam.

The big increase in compensation for loss of agriculture lands,
financial help in house construction at resettlement sites and cash
incentives for an early shift from the building site by locals are some
of the main features of the project package - and also a reason why the
cost has escalated so precipitately from the 1970s.

Environmental lobbyists opposing the project have been pressing people
to hang on to their lands. The THDC authorities hope all residents of
the town will have shifted to resettlement sites before June, when the
waters brought in by the monsoon rains are impounded by the dam.

A 4 x 250 MW pumped storage plant at Tehri and a 4 x 100 MW hydropower
plant, with a 103 metre high concrete dam at Koteshwar, 22 km
downstream of Tehri, have been planned for the second stage of the
project.

SCHEMES FREED FROM DELHI RED TAPE DELAYS

Power projects with a value of up to Rs4bn ($114m) have been set free
from the time-consuming scrutiny of the Central Electricity Authority
in a move to speed up approvals and hasten construction of smaller
power schemes.

A government notification has specified that only projects allotted
through competitive bidding below this threshold level will be spared
the rigours of CEA techno-economic scrutiny. All other projects will
continue to be governed by the existing guidelines, which provide an
exemption from the CEA clearance only if the capital expenditure is
less than Rs1bn ($28.5m).

The four-fold increase in the exemption limit is targeted at taking the
edge off the official scrutiny process, which is a source of ire to
nearly all project sponsors. Few projects have been cleared by the CEA
in the past five years.

The Power Minister feels that competitive bidding cane take care of the
cost and other factors which the CEA usually examines; therefore the
projects selected through open tender system need not be submitted for
the CEA scrutiny.

CEPA POWER PURCHASE DEAL APPEARS `ALL SET'

A project proposal in which CEPA of Hong Kong, part of Gordon Wu's
Hopewell Holdings empire, would secure agreement to build coal-fired
power stations in India, has moved forward with what are described as
`preliminary agreements' for a power purchase agreement.

CEPA is seeking to set up 10,560 MW of thermal capacity in the country,
probably using a series of 660 MW off-the-shelf base load power units.
The deal, when finalised, would be a record-breaker for India (and for
Wu), given that it would be the largest private sector scheme of its
kind for Asia's second most populous country after China. Negotiations
for the project began in 1993.

Under the agreement, which involves both the central government and
various state authorities, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana
states are committed to lift 1,300 MW, 1,200 MW, 800 MW and 700 MW
respectively from the 6 x 660 MW first phase of the 16-unit scheme. The
units would be installed at Hirma in Orissa State.

The first unit will be commissioned within 36 months of the financial
closure, and one unit is to be added at each subsequent three-month
interval. Power from the first two units will be wheeled to Gujarat.

A significant aspect of the preliminary deals is that the state
governments will establish "an appropriate payment guarantee structure"
for power purchases from the Hirma project. CEPA also wants to tap into
World Bank guarantees, but this will be no easy task given the Bank's
increasing requirements for a more transparently commercial approach to
power generation by the heavily subsidised and money-losing state power
boards.

World Bank financing, or support by other national aid agencies or
multilaterals, will be important for CEPA which, like other private
power sponsors, recognises the need to create a multinational
`cocktail' of financing arrangements to make infrastructure projects in
high risk developing countries work.

Another signatory to the preliminary agreements is Power Grid Corp of
India, which will develop the transmission system necessary to wheel
the power.

PRESSURE ON FOR FURTHER DABHOL TARIFF TRADE OFF

Last-minute jockeying between Enron and its partners in the Dabhol
project consortium and the Maharashtra government was taking place as
Power in Asia went to press, suggesting that Enron Development Corp. of
the US may yield further concessions for lower tariffs for India's
first private sector LNG power project.

The talks have been under way for months between the two warring
parties to revive the two-phase, $2.5bn power project at Dabhol, which
was ordered by the new state government to be suspended last summer
after construction was under way and financial close had been arranged
with the state's previous government.

Enron in Houston was tight-lipped Friday, saying only that "we are
waiting for Saturday" -  by which time a special cabinet meeting of the
Maharashtra state government will have taken place to consider the
latest Enron/government position.

If there is much more delay, arbitration proceedings against the state
brought by Enron and its partners Bechtel and GE Capital, will be got
under way in London. They are scheduled for January 15.

One aspect of the latest speculative offer is a marginal reduction by
Enron in the tariff, at which the 2,015 MW project will sell
electricity to the state power board, to Rs1.89 levelised tariff agreed
earlier in return for which the power board will lift power at more
than the 90% plant load factor mentioned in the original power purchase
agreement.

KERALA FAST-TRACK SHORTLIST

Nine project developers have been selected for small, fast-track
projects as part of the emergency plan of Kerala state to overcome a
400 MW power shortage which is hurting the economy. The projects would
range in size between 15 MW and 30 MW.

Proposals for the projects, to go up in the next year, were called by
the state-owned Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and the Kerala
State Industrial Development Corp. (KSIDC).

The developers with project locations in brackets selected by the KSIDC
include the following:

* Lok Housing with EDL of Australia (Bekaal, Malappuram and Chavara).

* IPCO-AGVL (Balusseir, Walayar and Kanjikode).

* BSES (Kakkanad and Technopark).

* Kings International Squa Marine Exports/Steag (Koothuparamba).

* Dalmia Bros. (Kanidkode).

These power stations are to come near industrial clusters suffering
from chronic power shortages. The developers have quoted tariff levels
of between Rs2.09 and 2.13/kWh.

The power sales tariff quoted by proposed sponsors picked up by the
KSEB varies from Rs2.10 to Rs2.63. Its choice of developers includes:

* Euro Capital (Vizhinjam, Kuttikatur, Mudakkayam, Nilambur and
Perinthalmanna).

* ABG (Kasargod and Kanhangad).

* Balaji Industries (Kodungaloor).

* Contake Abadi (Veli).

IFC BACKS AES WITH $79M LOAN FOR MUZZAFARGARH

The International Finance Corp (IFC) has signed an investment agreement
with AES Pak Generation (Private) Co. (AESPG) to provide a $79.5m
finance and equity package to help finance the $350m power plant
planned for Muzzafargarh in southern Punjab.

The IFC said the amount will be split into $39m equity and the
remaining will be raised through a syndicated loan.

The AESPG is the second IFC-financed tie-up with AES in Pakistan. The
project calls for construction of a 360 MW oil-fired power complex,
which will be equipped with a flue gas desulphurisation facility, the
first such plant of this type in the country.

Additional financing will come from a variety of sources, with
commercial funding coming from ING, Dresdner Bank, Natwest  and Korea
Merchant Banking Corp. In addition, the Japanese Export-Import Bank
will provide a loan of $148m.

Singapore-based AES Transport, a subsidiary of AES Corp of the US, will
be turnkey contractor for the project. AES will have an equity stake of
$85m, according to Shahzad Qasim, director of AESPG.

He said that AES expects to start generating 720 MW from both its
Pakistan operations by December 1997 - the other unit is under
construction at Lal Pir in Punjab and it reached financial close
earlier this year.

WAPDA, the state power utility, will lift the electricity under a 30-
year agreement, while another government, Pakistan State Oil (PSO),
will supply fuel oil under a 30-year agreement.

Vijay Chaudhry, IFC power division manager, said the agreement brings
to $280m the corporation's investments in the private power sector.

* The privatisation commission has appointed the IFC as financial
adviser to the privatisation of the Faisalabad Electric Area
Electricity Board. The IFC will help lay out a framework for the
separation of the FAEB from WAPDA so that it can operate as a privately
owned and regulated power distribution company.

The regulatory framework will establish rules for the rate-setting
mechanism, FAEB's interaction with WAPDA, the National Electric Power
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) and private power generators. The success
of unbundling FAEB from WAPDA should provide a guideline for the
privatisation of seven other distribution boards.

NEW DATES FOR SRI PRIVATISATION

The Sri Lanka government has set new dates for starting to privatise
the power sector by calling for a strategic partner for Lanka
Electricity Co, Officials said.

"We have extended the date for submitting expressions of interest to
January 16, 1996 from December 1, 1995," an official of the Public
Enterprise Reform Commission, which oversees privatisations, said.  The
new agenda is the result of requests made by power operators, asking
for more time, the official said.

The commission first advertised locally and overseas in late October,
asking for power operators interested in taking a 51% in LECO, to
express interest by December 1.

"We got over 10 expressions of interest and a host of requests on
December 1, asking for more time," the official said.  According to the
new timeframe, the short-list of operators pre-qualified to bid will be
made available not later than January 23, the official added.

LECO, the second largest power distributor in Sri Lanka, handles nearly
20% of electricity generated in the country.  The balance is

WB, JAPANESE LOCK DOWN FINANCING FOR GHAZI BAROTHA

The World Bank and the Japanese government have announced their
respective contributions towards the Ghazi Barotha dam. The Bank
announced just before Christmas that it would provide a $350m loan
towards the cost of the $2.25bn scheme. The Bank's financing will
account for 15.6% of the project's requirements.

The Bank's commitment to the scheme shows that it is still backing
large hydropower projects - this was in doubt because of its withdrawal
from the Arun III hydropower scheme in Nepal earlier this year (See ADB
feature).

The  scheme will involve works near the village of Ghazi, a 52 km long
power channel, a power complex near Barotha village to generate about
6,600 GWh of energy annually, transmission facilities and environmental
management and resettlement plans. The forecast of Pakistan's
unconstrained commercial energy demand calls for an annual increase of
about 6.7% up to 2008.

According to Zoubeida Ladhibi-Belk, power engineer at the Bank's South
Asia Department, the project will reduce the high cost of electricity
and will boost access to power in the country's rural areas.

The Bank has been careful to ensure that all environmental pitfalls
associated with such projects have been taken into account before
committing itself to backing the scheme.

According to the Bank, a total of 22,360 people will be affected by the
project, mostly only to a limited extent. Of these, some 900 living in
110 housing units will need to be resettled. An integrated regional
development plan has been developed to provide health and education
programmes.

Meanwhile, Japan's OECF said it will provide $350m towards the scheme.
It will provide the funds in two phases. The first will consist of
$200m and will be offered during the current financial year, while the
second tranche of $150m will be released after the utilisation of funds
for the first phase. The decision to provide funding in two phases
followed detailed OECF analysis. A Japanese delegation declared itself
"satisfied: that the project was economically viable.

WU PROJECT GROUNDBREAKING

Prime Minister Bhutto will perform the ground-breaking ceremony at the
site of the 5,280 MW coal-fired power plant earmarked for Keti Bander
in Sind province. The project is being undertaken by Consolidated
Electric Power Asia, part of Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings of Hong
Kong.

The move is a strategic breakthrough, not only because of its
ceremonial value but because it further confirms the momentum that has
gathered behind what promises to be Pakistan's largest thermal power
project, proposed by the entrepreneurial Wu in 1993.

The invitation to the groundbreaking was made by Agha Tariq Khan, the
Sind Mineral Development Minister.

The project's cost, including all the associated infrastructure,
including a coal terminal to handle imported coal and roads to handle
domestic coal at the project's later phases, is put at $8bn. Initially
this will be much less as the project will be built in a series of
single 600 MW units.

The plants would ultimately require 30mt-35mt of coal annually.
Officials close to the government said CEPA had already provided $5m to
the Sind government to carry out a feasibility study of Ket Bander,
where eight units will eventually be installed, providing financing can
be raised for a private power scheme of such a scale.

NEA, NPC BENEFIT FROM CASH ADVANCES

The National Electrification Administration and the National Power
Corp. are among the biggest recipients of cash advances from the
government, which an inter-agency committee wants to stop to lessen
money claims on the Treasury.

Of the Ps44.4bn ($1.8bn) of such advances as of last October, Ps5.6bn
went to the NEA and Ps4.50bn to NPC.

One way in which NPC's dependency on government handouts will be
reduced will be signposted this year when NPC starts offering
hydropower projects to the private sector, to be built on a BOT basis.

The offers will apply to projects planned for completion between 2000
and 2005. This is something of an experiment as the government's and
NPC's privatisation programme has revolved around thermal power
projects, not the more capital-intensive hydropower schemes.

Excluded in the bidding are the construction of two hydros with a
combined capacity of 300 MW in Kalayaan in Laguna, south of Manila, and
the rehabilitation of the 350 MW hydro scheme in Caliraya-Botocan-
Kalayaan, also in Laguna.

Contracts in both are already in the final stages of negotiations with
Argentina's Industrias Metalurgicas Pescamera Sociedad Anonima. NPC is
trying to persuade the Board of Investments to grant tax exemptions and
other fiscal perquisites to hydro schemes.

To lure private investments, NPC itself is thinking of shouldering the
costs of putting up access roads and transmission lines as well as in
obtaining rights of way to and from each project.

Among those to be the subject of bidding are the 29 MW Timbaban scheme
in Visayas in the Central Philippines; and the 32 MW Villasiga unit in
Antique, a 150 MW complex in Bulanog-Batang in Bukidnon in Mindanao;
the 300 MW Pulangi project in Bukidnon and the 224 MW Agus III in Lanao
del Sur.

* The Board of Investments has approved tax breaks for two geothermal
power projects to be built by PNOC-Energy Development Corp. One is a
PS6.04bn geothermal steam field and a 120 MW power plant in Mount Labo
in Camarines, south of Manila. The other project is a PS2.5bn
geothermal steam field and power plant in Negros in the central
Philippines. It has a capacity of 40 MW.

W'HOUSE SETTLEMENT STILL FACES SUPREME COURT CHALLENGE

The infamous saga of the Westinghouse-built Bataan nuclear power
station dispute may be 99% over but there remains a niggling 1% that is
still to be resolved before the case can truly be said to be settled.

The legality of the recent out-of-court settlement of the dispute
between Manila and the US company (over bribe allegations stemming from
the 1976 contract award by the Marcos government to Westinghouse) is
still under challenge in the Supreme Court.

Some senators insist the settlement has to be ratified by them, but the
National Power Corp. has formally lifted the ban on power equipment
manufactured or licenced by Westinghouse.

The lifting of the ban was jointly agreed by the two sides. It paves
the way for a second bidding at a still-unspecified date for a BOT
contract covering a gas-fired project in Ilijan in Batangas.

The first bidding for what was then a 1,200 MW gas-fired power contract
went to Hong Kong's CEPA in venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
(MHI).

The bid award was cancelled because of allegations that MHI was using
Westinghouse technology in its turbine equipment. Another bidder, AES
Transpower Corp., was also cited as a user of the offending technology.

PLN ALLOCATES $94M FOR SOUTH SULAWESI HYDRO PLANT

State-owned electricity company PT PLN plans to spend $94m on the
construction of a 74.8 MW hydro-electric power plant near Palu, Central
Sulawesi.

Construction of the plant is due to commence in 1999 and to be
completed in 2003, the official Indonesian news agency Antara reported
in late December.  To be known as Palu-3, the plant will use water from
Lake Lindu, located 40km south of Palu at an altitude of 960m above sea
level.  The lake has a surface area of 35.4 square kilometres, with a
normal debit of 16.5 cubic metres.

Palu-3 will be Central Sulawesi's largest hydro-power plant to date.

Evidently anxious to avoid the civil unrest that has accompanied
previous dam projects, PLN abandoned an earlier plan for Palu-3, which
would have seen the lake's water level rise by 2m, submerging 274.5ha
of cultivated land and 164 houses.

The head of PLN's Palu office was quoted as saying that the project
would not take any land from the local population nor damage the
environment in any way, notwithstanding is location with the Lore-
Kalamanta National Park.

A 983m pipeline with a diameter of 2.6m will channel the lake's waters
to 373m drop at which the turbines will be located.

The primary recipient of the electricity generated will be a cement
plant in the town of Donggala, which lies in the hills to the west of
Palu.  The cement plant will require at least 90 MW.  The difference is
to be made up by electricity from a diesel-powered plant in Silae, West
Palu.

The Silae plant currently has a capacity of 32.7 MW, which is scheduled
to be raised by 100 MW in the course of this year.

PLN's cost estimate for the project does not include a 46.5 km 150 kVa
transmission line linking the power station with Palu.

Central Sulawesi's electricity demand is projected to reach 148.2 MW by
2003.

PGN SIGNS $1.3BN DEAL WITH BRIGHTON LTD

State-owned gas company PT Gas Negara has signed a $1.3bn contract with
Brighton Ltd for the supply of gas to the latter's planned 600 MW
combined cycle power plant on Batam Island in Riau province.

Under the contract, Gas Negara will supply 60,000 standard cubic feet
per day to the Brighton plant for a period of 20 years.  The gas is to
be delivered through the Asmera-Duri-Batam pipeline, currently being
tendered.

The pipeline project is to be funded jointly by the Asian Development
Bank, the Japan Export-Import Bank, the European Development Bank and
Gas Negara.

Construction of the Brighton plant is due to commence in 1998.  It is
scheduled to begin commercial operations in 1999, with an initial
capacity of 150 MW.  To that stage, the project is said to involve an
investment of $100m.  The plant's capacity is to be expanded later to
600 MW, at an estimated additional investment of $500m.

Brighton, which is 55% owned by President Suharto's second son Bambang
Trihatmojo, is registered in Western Samoa.  The Batam power station is
being constructed together with Indonesian company PT Kresna Tara,
which is also 55% owned by Mr Trihatmojo.

Other partners in the project are Johanes Kotjo, Bambang Riyadi Soegama
and Wisma Suhardono.

Located 20 km south of Singapore, Batam Island is growing rapidly as an
export-oriented industrial zone.  As of June 1995 investment on Batam
had reached $5.3bn.  Exports from the island between January and June
1995 were worth $1.055bn, as compared with $1.339bn for the whole of
1994.

TENAGA HOPES FOR TARIFFS DECISION BY EARLY SPRING

Tenaga Nasional, the state-owned power utility, said it is optimistic
that the government will decide on its proposed restructuring of power
tariffs by the first quarter.

Ani bin Arope, the executive chairman, said the utility had submitted a
"rebalancing proposal" on tariff rates but declined to give details.
The move, first announced months ago, follows a government decision
earlier to turn thumbs down to a request for tariff hikes. The move
raised questions about Tenaga's freedom to implement tariff formulas
which affect its earnings and profits.

Ani said the new proposal takes into consideration the ration of power
consumer groups. "Domestic users now accounts for 40% of our customers
and the manufacturing sector 60%. It was the other way round
previously, he said.

The government had earlier suggested to Tenaga that it raise the
minimum rate charged for residential users under its tariff
restructuring proposal. Tariff hikes are important as Tenaga has signed
contracts to buy power from Malaysia's five private power producers;
without higher rates the state group will have to absorb the costs
instead of being able to pass them on the consumers.

Ani said Tenaga spent up to M$1bn for buying power last year and the
amount would rise to an estimated M$1bn in 1996. Tenaga reported a
pretax profit of M$1.64bn for the year-ended August 31, down 17% from
M$1.98bn the year before. This year's result, while nothing to write
home about, should be "no worse" than that recorded in 1995.

In the last financial year, Ani said Tenaga spent some M$3.4bn on
infrastructure. "We will spend M$4bn a year up to 2000 on
infrastructure." He said the country's power demand was growing at 12%-
15% a year.

Ani said Tenaga had signed an agreement to take a 20% stake in a $200m
power project in Pakistan. It was also in final negotiations for its
proposed 25% equity stake in a power project in Karnataka, India.

Tenaga also was considering an offer to take up a 15% stake in the
M$15bn Bakun hydropower project in Sarawak, a scheme, because of its
deforestation implications, which promises to be one of the most
controversial power schemes in Asia, and which has raised a chorus of
international disapproval and opprobrium.

TENDERS IMMINENT FOR BAKUN MEGA HYDROPOWER SCHEME

The Bakun Hydroelectric Corp. (BHC), the brainchild of Ting Pek Khiing,
the Sarawak timber baron, says it will issue its first tenders for the
M$15bn ($5.9bn) Bakun hydropower dam this month. The project will have
a capacity of more than 2,000 MW, including a 650 km subsea
transmission line from Sarawak to the Malaysia peninsula.

The company says it has already awarded a M$247m ($97m) contract to
Dong Ah Construction of South Korea to divert a river at the dam site
keep in the Borneo rainforests. Lahmeyer of Germany has been awarded
the engineering consultancy contract. Sixteen companies are claimed to
be positioning themselves to bid for the main engineering and
construction contracts.

The company says that construction will start in May, pending approval
of an Environmental Impact Assessment from a pro-dam Sarawak state
government, which will be a stakeholder in the project. The key player
is Ting's Ekran Bhd, which owns a controlling stake in BHC. It said
that a rights (new shares for old) and bond issue were still under
preparation and were not yet ready for shareholder approval.

The project has been roundly criticised by virtually every
environmental group looking into it because of the damaging effects of
the massive deforestation, the impracticality of the scheme being so
far from major population centres and the dislocation of local
tribespeople. It is estimated that the dislocation could affect 10,000
people.

Nevertheless, the scheme is going ahead, not least because of the
support of the government, which, through Tenaga Nasional, the state-
owned utility, will be a part shareholder, as will the national pension
fund. Ting and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad are also close friends.

Ekran spokesman Sunny Khoo said recently that the company hoped to
raise M$400m from the sale of 8m cu. m of logs. Last August, the
company sold the rights to 3m cu. m of timber to a company called
Ultimate Strategies Bhd for M$405m. Khoo said at the time that if the
company could not get the price it wanted for the timber "then we will
log it ourselves." The sam site, and the timber on it, covers 80,000
hectares.

But according to a Kuala Lumpur-based foreign broker, "It is difficult
to see exactly who will want to put their money into Bakun. Local
investors who enjoy a gamble might be interested but then they want
their money back fast. The payback from Bakun could stretch well into
the next century."

Nevertheless, the government deems the project essential because of
anticipated electricity shortfalls in the next century. The government
recently stated it would not review or reschedule mega projects it
considered critical for continued economic development.

PROTESTS FORCE SHIFT OF WASTE POWER SITE

The cabinet has decided to relocate the controversial waste-to-energy
power plant in the northern province of Chiang Mal in a move to end the
year-long protest by locals.

The decision was made on December 26 as protest against the garbage-
lignite fired power house seemed to peak as some 300 villagers from
Hang Dong district, where the 20 MW facility was to be built, staged a
rally at Government House in Bangkok.

The decision is a defeat for the Government, and the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA), who failed to convince the local people,
after a public relations stint, that the project was environmentally
friendly.

Speaking after the Cabinet meeting, Technology and Environment Minister
Yingphan Manasikarn insisted the cabinet's resolution does not mean the
scrapping of the project, sponsored by PEA.

He said the cabinet has taken a view that the project should remain
because it would help solve Chiang Mai city's mounting garbage problems
while contributing to the provision of electric power.  It would be
relocated to other districts in the province provided that locals
agree, Yingphan said.

Deputy Interior Minister Kiatchai Chalchawarat, who oversees PEA said
certain areas in San Sai and San Pa Tong districts of Chiang Mai may be
alternative sites for the facility.

At one point four months ago, Kiatchai, who was sent to brief some
5,000 residents about the project at Hang Dong, narrowly escaped an
attack by a mob of villagers angered by the government's refusal to
scrap the scheme.

Villagers feared that their backyard would be turned into a dumping
site of garbage and the combustion of rubbish and the lignite would
create adverse environmental impact to their neighbourhood.

For the time being, it is not known the extent of effect the Cabinet's
resolution has on the $57.2m contract PEA awarded last March to
Kvaerner EnviroPower AB of Sweden to build the plant (PiA 173, Apr 3).

Yingphan only said that PEA would need to negotiate with Swedish
offshoot of Norwegian Kvaerner industrial group about the new operating
environment.

The scheme was earlier set to come on line on December 5, 1996.  But
opposition has delayed construction for nearly a year, making it
impossible to achieve that date.

DSM TO GET $40M

Thailand will earmark 1bn baht ($40m) budget for its demand side
management (DSM) project in 1996 as part of the continuation of its
energy conservation programme.  According to Sithiporn Ratanopas, EGAT
DSM director, 300m baht will go towards advertisement to promote public
awareness on energy conservation.  The advertising effort will focus on
promoting energy-efficient electrical appliance like refrigerators, air-
conditioners, ballasts and compact fluorescent bulbs.  The remaining
700m baht fund will for efficiency testing of air conditioners and
refrigerators, and developing a thermal storage and efficient motor
programmes.

EGAT is attempting to replace 20m typical ballasts in hotels and large
buildings nationwide with those which can save up to 40% of electricity
consumption.  EGAT will also use an energy saving label campaign with
7,00-27,000-BTU air conditioners in 1996.  The degree of energy-saving
capacity indication will vary from one to five.  In 1996, EGAT will
begin to import 20 watt compact fluorescent tubes, which will replace
conventional 100 watt bulb.   They will be sold 20% below import price.
 The volume of import will be 1.6m units, worth 306m baht.

The power authority has spend 87m baht to promote "slim" fluorescent
and energy-saving label campaigns in 1995.  The success of the two
campaign is a booster for EGAT to go further with its energy
conservation campaign in 1996.  Sithiporn said the DSM project would
help reduce Thailand's power consumption by 10%, or 100bn units per
year.

OLD HYDRO SCHEME GETS NEW UNIT

EGAT marked the completion of a 2.71 baht *$108.4m) scheme that further
maximises the hydro benefits derived from Thailand's first
hydroelectric dam.

The opening of the Lower Mae Ping project, an extension of the 31-year-
old Bhumibol dam in the northwestern province of Tak, was officiated by
HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on December 28.

An additional turbine generating unit, the eighth of Bhumibol and of a
pumped storage type, will beef up Bhumibol's combined installed
generating capacity by 32% to 720.8 MW, starting this month to augment
peak power supplies.

The Lower Mae Ping dam was built across the Mae Ping river some 5 km
downstream of the Bhumibol dam in the province's Sam Ngao district.  It
is 200 metres wide and eight metres high.  Construction began in June
1991, but the cost inflated from 2.35bn baht to 2.71bn baht.

The secondary dam helps to hold back the stream flowed through Bhumibol
and the pumps divert part of the water back to the main dam by a pump
which will be operated during the off-peak period.

EGAT director Somboon Manenava said the Lower Mae Ping dam could helps
to conserve about 450m cubic metres of water annually which would other
be drained out from the system.  The project is capable of pumping back
3.5m cubic metres of water each day back to the main Bhumibol dam for
irrigation and power generation.

Lower Mae Ping turbine generator was supplied by a consortium of
Kvaerner Energy AS and ABB Power Generation Ltd.  The civil works were
undertaken by Vianini Lavori SpA.

Meanwhile, as additional sites for developing new hydro have either run
out or have been restricted by environmentalists' opposition, the Thai
power authority is turing to pumped storage to maximise benefits from
existing dams.

EGAT is now assessing he economic proposition of installing pumped
storage systems at the Khirithan dam in Chanthaburi, the Chulabhorn dam
in the northeastern province of Chaiyaphum and Ta Tung Na dam in the
western province Kanchanaburi.

EGAT g-m Preecha Chungwatana said these possible pumped storage sites
are in various stages of study.  That of the Khirithan seems to be in
the most advanced phase with reports are mostly completed and a public
relation campaign is being exercised to win approval from villagers.

It is too early to say how EGAT would proceed with possible pumped
storage projects nor to detail how much more electrical power they can
render, according to the EGAT chief.  The current installed generating
capacity of Khirithan is 12.70 MW, 40 MW at Chulabhorn 40 MW and 38 MW
at Ta Tung Na.

EGAT has already completed two pumped storage projects, one at the Sri
Nakarin dam in Kanchanaburi with installed capacity of 720 MW and more
recently at Bhumibol.

A third pumped storage scheme now under construction is the Lam
Takhong, rated 1,000 MW, in Nakhon Ratchasima, some 200 km northeast of
Bangkok.  The initial phase of the scheme with is slated to come on
line in stages beginning in the year 2000 (PiA 191, Dec 11).

According to Preecha said the pumped storage hydroelectric projects are
viewed generally as the best method to fully utilise the country's
limited hydro resources both for the purpose of power generation and
irrigation.  EGAT has no firm plan to start any new dam projects.  As
at the end of November EGAT was operating 53 hydro generation units
with a combined installed capacity of 2,690 MW, representing about 18%
of EGAT's total installed capacity of 14,595 MW.

SETBACK FOR MALAY POWER EXPORTS

Malaysia's bid to export electricity to Thailand has initially met with
rejection from its potential Thai buyer, and the prospects for
establishing an agreement now seem remote.

Preecha Chungwatana, EGAT's g-m said the basic power tariff and supply
terms offered by Tenaga Technology Perlis (TTG), part of Malaysia's
Tenaga Nasional Bhd, are unacceptable.

TTG proposed a base tariff of 6 cents/kWh at the delivery point on the
Thailand-Malaysia border as well as requiring EGAT to take delivery of
the entire proposed load of 300 MW on a "fully despatchable" basis, on
a firm and full continuous basis for the entire life of the long-term
supply contract.

The EGAT chief said the proposed price is simply too high as it exceeds
the rate on which EGAT pays for electricity purchased from other
sources such as Laos or for power generated from EGAT's own power
plants in Thailand.  The current base price of power EGAT buys from
Laos is around 4 cents/kWh.

Furthermore, EGAT is only prepared to take the full proposed load
during Thailand's peak afternoon/early evening power demand with a
provision to guarantee a minimum offtake of 50% - 60% of the total
proposed capacity at any time of the day.

EGAT's reaction to the terms proposed by TTG could spell doom of the
large natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant being planned by Tenaga in
northern Malaysian peninsula state of Perils near the Thai border.

EGAT has already made its stance known to TTG and asked the Malaysian
outfit to sweeten its proposal and come up with a new offer later.  But
the EGAT chief expressed doubts if TTG could reduce the offered power
tariff further because the cost of power generation in Malaysia is
high.

According to Preecha, Malaysia initially wanted to sell its indigenous
natural gas to Thailand, but later opted to sell electricity generated
from its natural gas as this energy form provides greater
profitability.  (PiA 178, June 12).

The EGAT chief noted that Thailand, especially its southern region, may
not need to rely on the proposed power sales from Malaysia in the short
term because of EGAT's surplus generating capacity in the region.  EGAT
presently has a combined installed generating capacity of about 1,200
MW in the region while demand is about 1,000 MW, therefore, he added.

Meanwhile, Laos has continued to make new offers to sell electricity
from several of its hydro electric power stations to EGAT.  Lately,
Laos and groups of international companies have presented details of
Nam Thuen I and Nam Ngum projects to EGAT officials, said Preecha.

LAMPANG LIGNITE SCHEME MAY BE BACK ON AGAIN

EGAT is eyeing opportunities to revive a plan to build a huge power
house using indigenous lignite reserves in the northern province of
Lampang.

EGAT Chief Preecha Chungwatana pointed to the possibilities of reviving
the 2,400 MW project, now on the "indefinite" waiting list after being
shelved in 1924.  The process of reviving this multi-billion-dollar
scheme could start as soon as EGAT succeeded in convincing authorities
and the public that the lignite-fired power plant was indeed
environmentally acceptable.

EGAT's existing lignite-fuelled Mae Moh power station in this province,
700 km north of Bangkok, has been in the centre of public criticism and
protests for causing pollution to its neighbourhood due to its emission
of sulphur dioxide and dust for several years.

Over the past two years, EGAT has started to equip sulphur dioxide
control systems to six of the newer generating units at the plant.

For the time being, there seems to be a good chance of proving that the
lignite-fired power station can be environmentally friendly, given that
the desulphurising systems installed in some generating units at Mae
Moh have worked well in effectively curbing sulphur dioxide emission.

The revival of the Lampang project is basically aimed at serving two
purposes.  First, to utilise the remaining lignite reserves at Mae Moh,
estimated at some 600mt in the "mineable" reserve category.  Secondly,
the additional generating capacity would enable EGAT to respond to the
country's fast-growing electricity demand in the future.

NEW ADB PLEDGE TO BACK CHINESE HYDRO AT TING RIVER

A total of 600 MW of peak power generating capacity, capable of
generating an average of 1,520 GWh of electricity a year, will be added
onto a major hydro scheme planned for the Ting River, in the Mianhuatan
Valley in Fujiian Province, China, with the help of a $170m loan from
the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

The project, costing a total $721m, all of which - apart from the ADB
loan - will be financed by Chinese loans and funds, is going to involve
the construction of: a 111-metre high, 302-metre long, roller-compacted-
concrete gravity dam and gated spillway; an underground power station
with four 150 MW turbine generator units and related tunnels; a ship
hoist to enable barges of up to 500t capacity to pass safely over the
currents at the dam site; and two single-circuit, and one double-
circuit 220 kV transmission lines, with a total length of 360 km and
substation facilities, connecting the new power station to the Fujiian
grid.

According to Arun Adarkar, the ADB's US chief direct beneficiaries of
the project will be industrial, residential and agricultural consumers
who now endure power shortages during peak hours, as a consequence of
the province's rapid economic growth.  The latter averaged 13.8% a year
from 1985-1994.

During the same period electricity generation in the province increased
almost fourfold.  However this expansion failed to keep pace with
demand, and the Fujiian Province's Electric Power Bureau estimated
supply shortages in 1994 of over 1,100 GWh, or 7.2% of annual sales.
ADB reckons this may be an under-estimate.

Meanwhile, indirect beneficiaries will be residents, and industrial and
agricultural enterprises situated downstream on the Ting River.  These
stand to gain because a reservoir is going to be created at the hydro
site, 64 square metres in size with a flow regulating storage capacity
of 1,122m cubic metres.  However at the dam site itself an estimated
36,000 people out of 41,000 living in the area will be displaced by
flooding, and will have to be re-located.

The project will help develop hydropower, a renewable resource, and
reduce Fujiian's reliance on coal, which causes pollution and is mainly
imported.  At the end of 1994 the installed capacity of the Fujiian
Power Grid was 5,261 MW; 3,261 MW of this was provided by hydro plants
(62%), and 2,000 MW by thermal plants (38%).  Only about 30% of
Fujiian's hydro potential has been developed so far.

As well as the $170m loan, ADB is providing $300,000 in technical
assistance to implement institutional reforms.  The underlying aim of
these is to separate the management of the Fujiian Province's Electric
Power Bureau from the management of the Fujiian Province's government.
In addition the technical assistance will be used to overhaul the
structure and levels of the Province's electricity tariffs.  ADB
sources say this is an area where a lot of work has to be done as
China's electricity pricing system in general is still extremely
distorted and often relies on subsidies.

The Mianhuatan Valley project will be the biggest of five-cascade hydro
schemes on the Ting River.  The other four are: a 140 MW Qingxi plant
in Guangdong Province, which has been commissioned; a 40 MW Jinshan
project which is under construction; and a 51 MW Huilong project and a
30 MW Shang Hang project which will be constructed after 2000.

The project confirms ADB's commitment to China.  Though a relatively
new borrower of the Bank, China is now the Bank's "biggest borrower"
for power projects, ahead of all of ADB's other clients.

WEAK HK ECONOMY FORCES CLP TO TRIM OUTLAY

China Light and Power has revised down its capital expenditure forecast
for 1992-1999 from HK$54bn to HK$52bn.

It is the second time within two years that CLP has had to revise down
its capital expenditure.  In 1994 the company trimmed capital
expenditure from HK$60bn to HK$54bn.

The reason for the current revision is the same as that given two years
ago, a drop in consumer demand for electricity, according to the
company.  The announcement was made recently at CLP's annual general
meeting in Hong Kong.

The fall in demand has meant that CLP has had to delay the
commissioning of the last four units of the Black Point Power station
until 2002.

The first four units of the 2,500 MW power station will start being
phased in this year.

CLP chairman Sir Sidney Gordon told the AGM that because of the drop in
demand the company had decide not to take part in the Daya Bay two
nuclear power plant at Ling Ao in Guangdong province.  Sir Sidney CLP
has had to react to the economic changes now taking place in Hong Kong.

He said that over the past 12 months Hong Kong had experienced an
unemployment rate of 3.6%, the highest in nine years; a slowing growth
of gross domestic product to 4.8% and flat retail sales.

"From our information some 30 factories either relocated to China or
shut down during the first six months of 1995, due to high operating
costs in Hong Kong, especially wages and rental costs," Sir Sidney
said, "and the trend is likely to continue."

"All these point to the urgent need for Hong Kong to lower its cost
structure in order to make it an affordable place in which to conduct
manufacturing and commercial business," he said.

"Our core business in Hong Kong, a barometer of the local economy, is
showing signs of change.  Sales to the manufacturing sector, for
instance, which used to form the backbone of our business and
contributing more than a third of our total sales, has dropped to half
that figure and is likely to go down even further over the next few
years."

He said that annual growth in overall sales is expected to hover
between 3% and 5.5% in line with GDP forecasts.

Sir Sidney said CLP acknowledged there was a problem, and the company's
senior management had spent the last 18 months carrying out a
comprehensive review of the company's position.  The result has been a
`macro-strategic plan' and a detailed' change plan.'

"The plans will focus on improving the utilisation of assets and
resources, streamlining procedures and setting and achieving a
performance target benchmarked to world's best practices," he said.

"At the same time we are leveraging our core skills in the engineering
and finance streams to develop new businesses in China and other parts
of Asia.

"In essence the strategic plans calls for the company's management to
take active steps to ensure the continued success of the core business
in Hong Kong and to explore investment opportunities elsewhere."

Sir Sidney said that due to the slowing down in local demand the
company had decided to reduce the size or defer the commissioning dates
of various power generating and transmission projects which should
result in large savings.

The delaying in commissioning of the last four units of the gas-fired
Black Point is part of the cost-saving exercise.

Sir Sidney said CLP intended to stretch the transmission and
distribution system by making it "work harder".  In doing so, he
admitted that there would be an "element of risk which, whilst
manageable for a short period, should not be either overlooked or
forgotten."

"In addition, management has imposed stringent control on manpower and
other operational expenses which we believe will bring about
significant savings by the end of the decade," he said.

On tariff increases, Sir Sidney said that "over the next few years
tariff increases will be below the prevailing inflation rate.  This is
no small commitment in view of the fact that in the past 10 years our
basic tariff has lagged behind inflation by nearly 80%," he said.

CHINA PIPING NATURAL GAS TO HONG KONG

China has begun piping natural gas to Hong Kong under a 20-year term
contract to feed the territory's power industry starting January 1,
officials from state-owned China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC)
said.  The gas is sourced from the Yacheng 13-1 field, located in the
South China Sea.  The field has an annual production of about 3.4bn
cubic metres of gas.  A total of 2.9m will be piped to Hong Kong via a
790 km pipeline, completed in June last year.  The remaining 0.5bn of
gas will be supplied to China's Hainan power station and chemical
plants via another 91 km pipeline.  Yacheng 13-1 development project is
51% owned by CNOOC, 14.3% by Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Corp
and 34.7% by Arco China.  The term supply into Hong Kong was signed
with Castle Peak Power Corp, a 50-50 joint venture between China Light
and Power and Exxon.  The piped gas will be used to feed the CLPs Black
Point Power station in Hong Kong.

MAJOR POWER SECTOR SHAKEUP

The Chinese government is to establish a National Power Corp to
supervise the supply of electricity throughout the country.

According to a report in the China Daily recently, the Ministry of
Power Industry is to be dissolved within the next few months and its
functions transferred to the corporation.

Power Industry Minister, Shi Dazhen made the announcement at a recent
conference in Beijing on China's power industry.

Although details are not clear, it is understood that the government
wants to separate the functions of enterprise from that of government.

According to the China Daily report the supervision of the industry
will be handled by the State Planning Commission and the State Economic
and Trade Commission while the China Electricity Council will act in an
advisory capacity between government, industry and enterprises.  The
National Power Corp will be the first step in the restructuring
process.

According to the report the National Power Corp will be the umbrella,
or parent, with regional companies as its subsidiaries.  Regional
companies will be responsible for provincial power companies who in
turn will be responsible for local power plants.

Science research and design institutes and colleges will become parts
of the National Power Corp and relations between them will be
established on the basis of property ownership.

Shi said China had installed power generators with a capacity of 75,000
MW over the past five years, including hydropower machines with 13,000
MW capacity.  Production of electricity has increased on an average
growth of 9.8% in the last five years, compared with 8.8% during 1986-
1990.

Japan Atomic Power Co (JAPC) and Tohoku Electric Power Co have
encountered problems that required the shutting down of reactors late
last month.  JAPC's Tokai reactor was shut down following a seawater
leakage; Tohoku Electric's Onagawa-2 BWR in Miyagi was shut down due to
a water leak.

The 825 MW Onagawa reactor is new and started commercial operations
last summer. Although the problems were minor, the closures were caught
(See Feature) in the wake of publicity connected with the shutdown of

SUMITOMO METAL PLANS TO MOVE INTO POWER SECTOR

Sumitomo Metal Industries, based in Osaka, intends to enter the
electric power wholesaling business by selling excess power that it
generates at its steel mills in Ibaraki, Osaka and Kansai prefectures.

The Kachima facility, Ibaraki, would sell power to Tepco, while the
other two facilities would sell to Kansai Electric if the company
submits successful bids to supply power.

Other steelmakers that are interested in the business are Kawasaki
Steel, Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel. Energy-related companies
considering moves to enter the power wholesale sector include Tomen
Corp., Japan Energy Corp. and Nippon Oil Co.

Moreover, Mitsubishi Materials Corp. is the first Japanese nonferrous
metal company to announce a plan to venture into the business. It hopes
to construct a coal-burning plant as large as 100 MW to sell power to
Nagoya-based Chubu Electric. Another option for Mitsubishi Materials is
to construct a coal burning facility that would supply Kyushu Electric,
which is headquartered in Fukuoka. In either case, the facility would
be constructed at an existing nonferrous metal or cement factory site.

DEMAND TO GROW 0.8%

Japan's electricity demand for this fiscal year ending March 31 is
expected to grow by a mere 0.8% from the previous year to 723.79bn
kilowatt hours, an industry research institute said.  Demand from large
industrial users is low in 1995/96, as a sluggishness domestic economy
has forced them to cut production because of growing inventories, the
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry said in a report.

Electricity demand in fiscal 1996/97 is forecast to rise by 1.9% to
737.41bn kWh.  An anticipated slight economic recovery in 1996/97 is
expected to drive up demand from large industrial users, the report
said.

If Japan goes through an exceptionally hot summer in 1996/97, as in
1994/95, electricity demand will surge by 4.4% from the previous year,
it said.  In electricity demand soared 7.4% from a year earlier.

Power generation in November rose 3.9% year-on-year to 65bn kWh, the
Federation of Electric Power Companies reported.

The federation said the increase in November electricity generation was
due to lower temperatures compared with a year earlier, which pushed up
heating demand.

Of the total electricity generation in November, nuclear power
generation by Japan's nine major electric power companies gained 13.8%
from the same period last year to 21.6bn kWh.

Hydropower generation surged 20.5% year-on-year to 3.5bn kWh.  The jump
reflects extremely low hydropower generation last November because of
water shortages.

Thermal power generation fell 4.7% due to the increase in nuclear power
generation, to 32.3bn kWh.

Japan's power utilities burnt 1.30m kilolitres (kl) of heavy fuel oil
for electricity during November, 1.47m kl of crude oil, 2.33m kl of
liquefied natural gas and 47,669 kl of naphtha, the federation said.

The companies consumed a total of 1.85mt of coal in November.

Entergy Corp. of the US has completed its takeover for Citipower, the
last of five power distributors sold off by the Victoria government.

The deal had been expected. Entergy had been named as the preferred
buyer and will pay a total of A$1.75bn, which includes a capital
payment of A$1.58bn and franchise fees with a present value of A$173m.

Despite the apparent `sell out' to foreign interests - all five
distributors were sold to US companies - the deal is regarded as a
success for Victoria state. It has raised A$9bn, more than domestic
analysts had predicted. A total of $1.3bn of the Citipower sale will go

WHOLESALE PRICING CLAIMED TO BE `ANTI-COMPETITIVE'

Major power users who make up 30% of New Zealand demand believe interim
wholesale pricing arrangements are "highly anti-competitive." They say
there are better ways to provide a learning environment until full
wholesale competition comes in later in 1996.

Competition watchdog, the Commerce Commission, on the other hand has
formed a preliminary view that the benefits to the public from the
interim rules will outweigh any lessening of competition. However, it
will not issue a final opinion until after public hearings on January
18-19.

The rules govern the relationship between Electricity Corp. of New
Zealand (ECNZ), and Contact Energy, the new state-owned power firm
being created by splitting ECNZ. The market will be run by EMCO, the
Electricity Market Company, at present a joint venture of ECNZ,
TransPower (which operates the grid) and the Electricity Supply
Association of New Zealand. Contact is expected to buy part of ECNZ's
EMCO stake.

In a submission put to the Commission before it issued its preliminary
view, the Major Electricity Users Group (MEUG) says it is particularly
concerned that the anti-competitive aspects of the interim arrangements
will carry over into the final rules for the wholesale electricity
market. This group argues that the interim supply agreement and the
asset sale and purchase agreement between ECNZ and Contact preserve
ECNZ's existing level of dominance in the market.

MEUG disagrees that six months of trial is necessary. As there is no
certainty that these rates will flow through to become the final rules,
it suggests the market could invest time and skills in managing the
interim, only to find that experience had become redundant. It suggests
paper trials should be looked at as an alternative.

A different view has been put by the country's largest company,
Fletcher Challenge, which is both a user and a utilities investor. It
sees the proposed rules As a "practical method of moving forward" on an
interim basis. Like others, however, it insists they should only be
interim. It wants a "drop dead" clause before the date at which the
electricity from an independent power plant is due to be dispatched
because the rules provide no incentive for third party generation.

The Commerce Commission is considering the bridging pricing rules to
apply to two interim phases. The first runs to April 6 from the date of
settlement (probably February 1) at the sale of generating plant by the
ECNZ to Contact Energy. The major change during this period will be the
development of competition between Contact and ECNZ to run whichever is
the marginal power station.

In the second phase to end-September, the notified change in ECNZ's
energy supply contracts will be set on a day-ahead rather than a week-
ahead basis, the charge will be calculated using actual rather than
forecast demand and the actual price paid by power purchasers will be
calculated from the marginal cost of the last station used to meet
actual demand.

Arrangements for full competition after that have not yet been
finalised. Key features are expected to be that rather than ECNZ
forming contracts with its customers, generators and purchasers will
contract with a pool; purchasers will be for electricity; that day-
ahead price will reflect the market clearing price based on bids to buy
and offers to sell; that the cap on the price of electricity in force
up to end-September will disappear; and that generators and purchasers
will be able to contract outside the pool and to trade their position.

BP TO DEVELOP GAS RESERVES IN THE SAHARA

BP has struck a $3.5bn gas deal with Sonatrach and the Algerian
government to develop reserves deep in the Sahara. The deal will boost
BP's worldwide gas production by 30%. The site of the development is
near In Salah, deep in central Algeria and far distant from the civil
war. The joint venture will give BP access to the European gas market.
The venture will sell some 10bn cu. m of gas per year into southern
Europe via the Transmed pipeline into Italy and the under-construction
pipeline between Morocco and Spain. Sonatrach already exports 30bn cu.
m of gas, mainly via Italy.

John Browne, BP Exploration Director, said the deal was the first of
its type signed with Sonatrach, the sole gas producer in Algeria, for
the last 30 years. Under the deal BP will take 30% of the net after
expenses of the gas to be sold. Under a typical production-sharing
contract, the foreign oil company is likely to earn 15% of the net.
BP's favourable terms stems from Algeria's prolonged civil strife And
the high political risk.

Other companies are gathering round too. Exxon is starting talks on a
similar gas development deal. Ammar Makhloufi, the Energy Minister,
said the government would like to see two or three major projects
emerge in the In Salah area. Algeria is said to be anxious for US and
British involvement in the sector, now dominated by French and Italian
companies.  Other companies, such as Total and Repsol of France were
said to be in `negociation avancee' to develop a field, known as TFT
(Tin Fouye Tabankort), close to the Libyan border and several hundred
kilometres from the BP field., according to Al-Hayat newspaper. This
field is said to contain commercial quantities of natural gas (144bn
cu. m); LPG (15.6m tonnes) and condensates (16.6mt).

As part of its liberalisation, the government in 1993 offered several
of the country's 23 blocks for production-sharing. Domestic demand is
expected to rise eight-fold by 2020 to 5.5m cu. f/d. Among exploration
groups are Occidental, Cairns Energy and Holland Sea Search and Rexwood
Okland of the US.  Some 43% of the country's gas is used for the power
sector, 88% of which are gas-fired; 34% is used as feedstock to the

year; gasoline at 960,000t, up from 680,000t, fuel oil at 890,000t,
kerosene at 300,000t and aviation fuel at 250,000t. Vietnam's main
importer is Petrolimex, which was given a 3.1mt quota for oil products,
up from 2.8mt in 1995. Petrolimex's diesel quota was set at 1.47mt,
gasoline at 700,000t, fuel oil at 680,000t, kerosene at 150,000t and
jet fuel at 100,000t.

Last December, Petrolimex signed an annual term contract with Kuwait
Petroleum Corp to lift 500,000t of 1% sulphur diesel and 80,000t of jet
fuel starting this month. Petrolimex's remaining requirements will be
met through quarterly tender invitations and spot purchases. The
balance of imports will be handled by other companies, such as Petex,
Vietnam Airline Petroleum Co., and a new oil marketing firm,
PetroVietnam Oil Processing, Distribution and Marketing Co. (PVPDC).

PHILIPPINES OIL PRICE STABILISATION FUND

PNOC plans to inject Ps8.6bn in the depleted oil price stabilisation
fund, says Energy Secretary Francisco Viray. He said Ps5bn will be
released for the oil fund soon, but state-owned PNOC will have to find
other sources for the remaining balance of Ps3.6bn. The fund was set up
by the government in the 1980s to protect consumers from wild swings in
world oil prices and forex problems. Oil companies give money to the
fund if world oil prices are soft and if the peso is strong versus the
dollar, then draw against it if the opposite occurs.

With the rise in crude prices and a weakening of the peso, the fund has
been dwindling and a deficit of Ps7.6bn was reached by year-end. To
shore it up, the country's three main oil groups, Petron Corp,
Pilipinas Shell Petroleum; and Caltex Philippines have asked the
government to hike the price of oil products, which it did so last week
by three centavos per litre.

tanks was under way and would be completed by early 1997.

MALAYSIAN CONTROVERSY OVER OIL DISCOVERIES

Malaysia is embroiled in controversy as to whether it is preventing
foreign companies from bringing new oil discoveries into commercial
production. Petronas chairman Azizan Zainul Abidin denies that this is
so. "They (foreign oil majors) paid the risk money for exploration and
if they make a discovery and that discovery is commercial, there is no
way we can stop that." Petronas president Hassan Marican added that it
was not possible for Petronas to turn away development plans once a
contractor declares commerciality. But there is much grousing abroad,
with foreign oil company managers saying Petronas stalls the process by
bureaucratic foot dragging over approvals for budgets and field
development plans, including types of platforms, pipelines and other
technical issues. "Technically they are right, you can declare a field
commercial," said one manager. "And once you do that the clock starts
ticking on the lease."

Over the past decade, foreign oil groups have found 2.4bn bbl of oil
and equivalent gas in Malaysia, 20% of Malaysia's remaining recoverable
reserves,but none has been put into production, says Wood Mackenzie.
The 2.4bn bbl of new petroleum finds were discovered by 16 companies.
But since Malaysia offered its first production-sharing contracts to
foreign groups in the 1970s, only Shell and Esso, the original two
contractors, are in production. Of the 16, ten have closed their
offices in Malaysia. Under a standard production-sharing contract,
Petronas is entitled to 85% of all the oil produced, once the foreign
partner recovers costs. The terms are considered among the most
unfavourable to foreign partners. But analysts point out that
production costs are cheap, which is what makes the market reasonably
attractive.

CHINA SEEKING FOREIGN CAPITAL TO FUND OILFIELD

China's first joint venture investment bank, the China International
Capital Corp., is seeking Yn6bn ($750m) in foreign capital to fund the
further development of a large oilfield in Jilin province. The bank is
a venture between Morgan Stanley, China's Bank of Construction, and
smaller shareholders including Singapore Investment Corp. Cal Jinyong
told the Financial Times that the bank was sole financial adviser to
the Jilin development. Funds would be raised  in the next five years to
lift production at the field, where reserves are estimated at 170m
tonnes.  Planned output would be 2mt; CICC might take a small stake in
the venture, but wants large oil companies as equity partners. Morgans
has a 35% stake in CICC, the Bank of Construction 42.5% and the balance
is spread among the others.

CHINA PLANNING TO BECOME MORE ACTIVE ABROAD

China is planning to become more active abroad in oil exploration in
order to counterbalance its own weak productivity in this sector, says
China News. It plans to produce 10mt of crude by 2000 and 20mt a decade
later. It is looking at the Middle East and Russia, mainly central
Asia, says Zhou Yongkang, vice-president of China National Petroleum
Corp. Meanwhile geologists have discovered natural gas reserves
estimated at 10cu. m in Taicang in Jiangsu province., Initial survey
and exploration has shown the field is only 50 metres underground with
gas of a high quality suitable for industrial and household use. No
details were given.

KOREA COULD PLAY ROLE IN OPENING RUSSIAN GAS RESERVES

ING Barings Bank says that Korea, rather than Japan, could play a
pivotal role in opening up Russian far eastern gas reserves. It is a
natural LNG market and lifts large amounts of LNG from the Middle East
and South East Asia. Far Eastern reserves would be virtually in its own
back garden and would give it greater diversity of supply. According to
the report, Seoul wants to boost relations with Russia and China and
would welcome a natural gas pipeline, which would be a symbol of
regional co-operation.

SOUTH KOREAN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS

South Korea has toughened environmental standards by lowering the
sulphur content in diesel fuel, effective January. Local oil refiners
now have to sell diesel with less than 0.1% sulphur compared with the
previous 0.2%. The content will be further lowered to a maximum of
0.05% in 1998, said the Energy Minister. It also said it will gradually
reduce the sulphur content in kerosene, currently set at a maximum of
0.08%.
