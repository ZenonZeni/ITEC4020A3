<P>In the last issue of the CONCAWE Review (Volume 4, Number 2, October
1995) the article on pages 4 and 5 described how the European Commission,
the Member States and the industries concerned were organizing the joint
development of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive (AQFD). In that article,
CONCAWE welcomed this further opportunity to assist the Commission to continue
with a rational approach to the development of EU environmental legislation.
To expand on what is said in the Foreword to this issue of the Review, some
features that CONCAWE believes are necessary ingredients in the process
are described below.

<B>RISK ASSESSMENT</b>
</center>
<P>The pollutant types addressed in the AQFD, e.g. nitrogen oxides (NOx),
sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (Pm), lead (Pb) and ozone (O3),
occur naturally in ambient air at some concentration. Knowing that there
are health and environmental hazards linked with elevated levels of the
pollutants, by itself, tells society nothing definitive about whether or
what action should be taken. Put simply, life cannot ever be made hazard
free; only the level of risk can be reduced.<BR>
<BR>
Thus risk assessment is essential, and the concept of risk management is
introduced. The Commission has prepared an 'issues' paper which sets out
these factors and recognizes the need to establish the dose-response relationship
for each pollutant. Taken together with the costs for compliance with various
levels in the range of the dose response curve, these enable the risk manager
to be in a position to determine an appropriate standard by comparing levels
of risk reduction with the associated costs.<BR>
<BR>
An unavoidable complication inherent in the risk relationships is that they
should include considerations regarding sensitive minorities (asthmatics
taking exercise, for example). Thus the process should be extended to include
the dimension of the target group to be protected. CONCAWE considers that
the dose response curves for both the sensitive minorities and the next
most sensitive population, together with the factoring in of the relevant
risk management procedures (e.g. rescheduling exercise routines, self-medication),
all have a part to play in setting appropriate air quality standards.

<B>LIMIT VALUE/ALERT THRESHOLD/PERCENTILE COMPLIANCE</b>
</center>

<P>CONCAWE believes it is self-evident that these aspects are interrelated
and form an essential part of the overall consideration of the risk management
step.<BR>
<BR>
The function of a limit value air quality standard (AQS) is to provide continuous
protection of the target group based on an assessment of risk and cost.
Compliance with a limit value in the EU will generally be based on an emission
reduction strategy, e.g. implementing control measures.<BR>

<br>

<br><br>
<tt>
General emissions controls can be cost-effective<br>
up to certain compliance percentiles, beyond which<br>
localized risk management  strategies are more appropriate.</tt></center>
<br>
<P>The alert threshold concept recognizes that for infrequent occurrences
(e.g. when a severe meteorological temperature inversion episode traps high
pollutant levels), general emission control approaches are extremely cost-inefficient
and specific risk management schemes are more appropriate. Thus alert thresholds
open up practical approaches to avoid spending a great deal of society's
money on reducing emissions to meet conditions that only occur for a few
hours/days in a given year at any one location. <BR>
<BR>
Percentile compliance setting serves to address two aspects. The first recognizes
that total compliance, as distinct from almost total compliance, can result
in significant increases in compliance costs for little additional protection.
The second aspect is that there is some optimal split between emission control
strategies and risk management strategies in providing the most cost-effective
protection of the target group. Here, the nature of the exceedances of the
relevant AQS needs to be understood. For example, are the exceedances confined
to discrete ongoing 'pollution episodes' or short daily events spread over
long time periods? Analysis of data from short-term continuous measurements
(e.g. as available in Germany) will provide some necessary guidance to the
process.

<B>SHORT-TERM STANDARDS (e.g. 15 MINUTES)</b></CENTER>

<P>EU Member States have expressed significant concerns about setting very
short-term standards-specifically with regard to human health considerations
related to SO2 exposures. It is recommended that the Working Group should
fully evaluate the potential for the derivation of a robust 'surrogate'
longer-term standard (e.g. 24 hours) that would be comparably protective
against the short-term effects. The resulting significant simplification
of measurement requirements would reduce the compliance costs without increasing
the health risk.

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>INDUSTRY EMISSION CONTROLS COST DATA</b></CENTER>

<BR>
<P>The individual industry sectors are each attempting to identify the costs
of reduction targets, e.g. for SO2: &shyp;20%, &shyp;40%, &shyp;60%, from
a base of 'today'. This should permit the Working Group to relate these
data to a range of possible limit values drawn from the dose-response relationships
and today's measured air quality. This equal reduction concept for all sectors
should simplify the assessment, for example, by eliminating the need for
source-receptor modelling.

<B>AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK DESIGN</b></CENTER>

<BR>
<P>The following technical issues will need particular attention in network
design guidelines to be developed by the European Environment Agency and
the Commission's Joint Research Centre: </B>
<UL>
<LI>What site classification system is required to enable the principle
of representative sites to be used reliably? 
<LI>What siting criteria should be used and how can they be related to the
principle that measured air quality should be an appropriate surrogate for
individual exposure over the averaging time of the standard? (Note: particulates
exposure over 24 hours; NO2 exposure over 1 hour.) 
<LI>What criteria should be used to define the minimum number of sites for
a given pollutant? 
<LI>What criteria should be set for acceptable 'assessment' techniques?
<LI>What criteria should be set for acceptable dispersion models? 
</UL>
