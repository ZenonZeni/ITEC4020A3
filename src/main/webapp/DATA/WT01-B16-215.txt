<b>ANGINA</b><p>

Albert, aged 70, had suffered with severe angina for almost 10 years. He had an average of 10 searing chest pains daily. In an attempt to correct this, his conventional physicians had performed 14 balloon angioplasties and one heart bypass surgery. By the time Albert came to Guillermo Asis, M.D., of The Marino Center for Progressive Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Albert's doctors had essentially written him off as untreatable. They had advised him to take as much nitroglycerin as he needed to get pain relief.<p>
"It was a serious case," says Dr. Asis. "His doctors literally did not know what else to do for Albert." However, in the view of Dr. Asis, Albert was medically treatable. <p>
He put Albert on a once-weekly program of chelation therapy to improve his circulation and heart function. For approximately 3 hours per session, Albert sat comfortably in Dr. Asis' office receiving an intravenous infusion of EDTA, the prime substance used in chelation therapy.<p>
In addition, Dr. Asis gave Albert "a very aggressive" multivitamin supplement called Vitality Plus (with high levels of the B vitamins, zinc, and copper) which he took 6 times daily. Albert also began taking magnesium aspartate (400 mg, 4 times daily) and zinc picolinate (50 mg daily). The purpose for these 2 supplements is that the chelation process unavoidably flushes these minerals out of the body, so adequate levels of both must be restored, says Dr. Asis. Albert started taking grape seed extract (50 mg, twice daily, as an antioxidant to help remove free radical poisons) and selenium (200 mcg, twice daily, an antioxidant known to benefit the heart).<p>
Within 8 weeks, Dr. Asis was able to take Albert off all conventional heart medications. Even better, his angina symptoms were dramatically improved—Albert experienced only 1 incident of chest pain per month. Albert received a total of 12 chelation treatments. By the end of the 3-month treatment, "virtually all of Albert's symptoms and discomfort were gone and he continues to do very well," says Dr. Asis.<p>

<b>ANXIETY</b><p>

About 3 months before she first consulted naturopathic physician Deborah Frances, N.D., of Grants Pass, Oregon, Susan suddenly began having anxiety attacks while visiting a relative. According to Dr. Frances, Susan reported a racing heart, terrible fear, and a "feeling like my soul is being sucked out of me." She added that her anxiety was easily relieved if she got distracted by something else.<p> 
Susan's medical history revealed childhood neglect and emotional abuse and the traumatic loss of a highly supportive younger brother that left her feeling "devastated." Since the birth of her son several years earlier, Susan had recurrent fears of and nightmares about danger to her newborn, sudden loss of her husband, and images of inexplicable invasion. During her interview with Dr. Frances, Susan wept as she described a "deep grief and longing to return home" to her childhood residence. At the time of the consultation, Susan was taking Xanax, a conventional antianxiety drug; she also indicated that she had undergone years of psychotherapy.<p>
Dr. Frances prescribed Piper Methysticum, a homeopathic remedy made from kava to be taken 3-4 times daily at 10-30 drops per dose. "My experience of Piper is that it seems to have an ability to lift one up out of darkness into a clearer, higher place," explains Dr. Frances.<p>  
Next she gave Susan a mixture of Rescue Remedy (an emotional first-aid preparation made from several flower essences) and the herb Oplopanax horridum, to be taken at least 4 times daily (2 drops each dose) and as additionally needed for anxiety. Dr. Frances prescribed this herb (often given for blood sugar disorders) because she knew it could help Susan develop a more self-confident psychological attitude, enabling her to "stand up for herself effectively, appropriately, and even fiercely," says Dr. Frances. In her view, anxiety is often associated with feelings of disempowerment.<p>
About 5 days after starting these remedies, Susan reported she was feeling relief. Dr. Frances added homeopathic Phosphorus to Susan's program. After a month, Susan was much improved, being better able to deal with the anxiety surges when they arose and no longer waking in the mornings filled with anxiety from her dreams. Around this time, the conventional physician who had prescribed the Xanax, began reducing the dose.<p> 
Several weeks later, Susan told Dr. Frances she was continuing to improve but had discontinued the Piper Methysticum because she disliked its taste and smell, and felt unexplainably afraid of it. Dr. Frances interpreted this information as indicating Susan was ready for the next stage in the prescribing. Dr. Frances put together an herbal formula to help release Susan's nostalgic attachment to and loss of personal power in her childhood. The herbs included 2 parts each of rose, passionflower, oat, and lemon balm, and 30 drops of sagebrush; the entire mixture was to be taken 3-4 times daily, 10-30 drops per dose.<p>
After about 6 weeks on this formula, Susan told Dr. Frances that her anxiety was steadily decreasing. The nightmares about her son and husband had stopped and she no longer felt the strong grief and longing for her childhood home.<p>

<b>CANCER</b><p>

In 1978, Millicent, aged 45, was diagnosed with an advanced stage of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissues) involving lymph nodes in her neck, groin, and armpits. She was also found to have a tumor mass dangerously compressing her spinal cord in her lower back, explains Michael B. Schachter, M.D., director of the Schachter Center for Complementary Medicine in Suffern, New York, who first saw Millicent after her biopsy.<p> 
The classification of this tumor (stage IVB) is conventionally associated with a 5-year survival of only 50%, or worse, says Dr. Schachter. "Millicent fought her cancer courageously with a variety of treatments, both conventional and alternative, for 7 years," he notes. In all, Millicent received treatments from at least 6 different alternative medicine physicians in addition to several conventional oncologists.<p> 
Millicent started the Gerson Diet Therapy (developed by Max Gerson, M.D., 1881-1959) which emphasizes the consumption of copious amounts of fresh vegetable juices. Over the course of several years, she received other major alternative cancer approaches, one being Immune Augmentation Therapy (developed by Lawrence Burton, Ph.D., 1926-1993) which involves the injection of certain blood proteins to stimulate the immune system.<p> 
Millicent also had injections of crucial immune system cells called lymphocytes; a series of heat treatments called whole-body hyperthermia in which a temporary fever is induced to enhance the immune system; infusions of high doses of vitamin C with amygdalin (or laetrile, prepared from apricot kernels); and numerous oral supplements, both herbal and nutritional. At other times, Millicent underwent several cycles of radiation and chemotherapy, including Cytoxan, Adriamycin, Bleomycin, and 5FU, "all well known for their potential toxicities," notes Dr. Schachter.<p>
At times, Millicent experienced a serious adverse reaction to the chemotherapy with significantly large drops in her white blood cell count. In the summers of 1988 and 1989 she had further radiation treatment on her head and neck. Throughout this ordeal, Millicent had recurrent bouts of pneumonia—"these are suspected to be complications of her chemotherapy," says Dr. Schachter.<p> 
Millicent also went into early menopause, probably induced by the intense drug treatment. While the combination of multiple alternative therapies and conventional treatments resulted in a series of remissions and partial remissions, she invariably developed a recurrence several months to a year following the partially successful treatments. In 1989, she again began to develop tumors in her neck.<p> 
At this point, Millicent decided to have all of her mercury dental amalgams replaced, based on the recommendations of several alternative physicians. "She has been tumor free since that time for the past 7 years," says Dr. Schachter, "and she attributes her successful remission to having her mercury fillings removed which resulted in no further exposure to mercury vapor emitted from the fillings."<p> 
At her most recent consultation with Dr. Schachter, Millicent was continuing with a healthy diet and taking numerous nutritional supplements including the adrenal glandular extract DHEA (10 mg, once daily). "All 4 of her key cancer markers are normal," says Dr. Schachter, reminding us that Millicent, now 63, is an 18-year survivor of a cancer that had a 10-year survival rate of less than 20%.<p>

<b>DEPRESSION</b><p>

When Penelope, aged 44, first consulted Joan M. Takacs, D.O., an osteopathic physician practicing in Portland, Oregon, she had been diagnosed with manic-depressive illness. Penelope complained of low energy in the afternoons and related episodes of being driven by "overwhelming" emotion and energy surges that gave way to depression, desperation, and suicidal thoughts. Penelope said she felt at these times as if "a dark cloud were hanging over her."<p>
"A weak liver is often responsible for depression," explains Dr. Takacs, who specializes in Anthroposophic medicine, an extension of the best parts of Western medicine that includes homeopathic remedies and a spiritual understanding of patients. "As we see it, the liver is the organ of life, involved in the breakdown and storage of nutrients, the production of many enzymes, and fluid control of the body," says Dr. Takacs. But the liver is also connected to the will and the emotions associated with that, she adds. "With manic states, the will becomes excessively active and the person is driven in terms of thinking and acting."<p>
Dr. Takacs prescribed remedies specific to Anthroposophic medicine including Fragaria vitis (from grape and strawberry leaves) to strengthen Penelope's liver and to aid in carbohydrate and sugar digestion; this remedy would also produce and balance more daytime energy and regulate sleeping cycles. Dr. Takacs also gave Penelope Aurum Stibium Hyocyamus to help strengthen her "heart forces" and to reconnect her thinking and action. "With the balancing forces of this combination of remedies, Penelope was able to overcome her illness," reports Dr. Takacs.<p>
Within a few weeks, Penelope said she was feeling much improved. "She was happier and noticed that upsetting things in life did not send her into profound depression," says Dr. Takacs. Her sleep was more refreshing and she no longer had afternoon energy lows. "After several months, the remedies were discontinued and Penelope has continued to do well," says Dr. Takacs.<p>

<b>ENDOMETRIOSIS</b><p>

When Rosanna, aged 30, first came to Carolyn DeMarco, M.D., in Toronto, Ontario, she had already undergone multiple surgeries for her endometriosis, but with no improvement. Rosanna's pelvic pain was still considerable and she was on Lupron, a powerful hormone drug that operates by deliberately exhausting the brain's pituitary gland (which is responsible for much of the body's hormonal activity). Lupron left her feeling mentally foggy and, at times, mentally dysfunctional.<p>
As a side effect of the Lupron, she went into early menopause with hot flashes and mood swings, for which Rosanna's conventional physicians prescribed synthetic estrogen and progesterone. These in turn produced many unpleasant side effects and by the time Rosanna came to Dr. DeMarco, she was determined to get off her multiple drug regimen and gain relief for her endometriosis.<p> 
Dr. DeMarco started Rosanna on a multifaceted program including castor oil packs  placed on her lower abdomen every evening. These would help draw out toxins, release tension, and increase blood circulation to her pelvic area.<p> 
Next, Dr. DeMarco started Rosanna on a natural progesterone cream, having her apply 1/2 to 1 teaspoon daily to different soft tissue sites on her body, from days 10-26 of her menstrual cycle. To avoid saturating a single area, Rosanna rotated the application site from her face to neck, inner arm, back of the wrist, abdomen, inner thigh, and breast. At the same time, Dr. DeMarco began reducing Rosanna's intake of synthetic estrogen and progesterone over a 4-week period, and she took Rosanna completely off the Lupron.<p>
Dr. DeMarco prescribed a balanced multiple mineral/vitamin supplement for Rosanna, an herbal blend (containing milk thistle, dandelion, and celan-dine) to strengthen her liver, and a lipotropic formula including choline, methionine, and inositol to help her liver break down estrogen. After 6-8 weeks on this combined program, Rosanna's pain was reduced and she was better able to cope with what pain there was, says Dr. DeMarco.<p>
At this point Dr. DeMarco began to address Rosanna's diet and possible food allergies. Prior to this, Rosanna had been unwilling to focus attention here. A comprehensive allergy test revealed that Rosanna had a high degree of Candida albicans yeast infection and parasites. Although the relationship is not yet precisely known, "Candida has a direct effect on hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, either by binding to the receptor sites or by forming antibodies which can then react against ovarian tissues," says Dr. DeMarco. Other physicians have noted that when they eliminated the Candida infection in women with endometriosis, it helped to improve this condition as well.<p>
Dr. DeMarco addressed the Candida infection with Acidophilus supplements and dietary changes, emphasizing the avoidance of sugars, fruit juices, yeasted breads, fermented foods, dairy products, dried or over-ripe fruits, and processed, canned, or moldy foods. In addition, Rosanna took caprylic acid (made from coconut oil) tablets, 2 before each meal; she continued this for 3 months. She also received desensitization shots for the Candida.<p>
To remove the parasites, Dr. DeMarco put Rosanna on a 90-day herbal program including wormwood, black walnut tincture, cloves, and grapefruit seed extract. As Rosanna was low in DHEA, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, Dr. DeMarco put her on DHEA plus adrenal and ovarian glandular extracts. She took the DHEA and adrenal glandular on an empty stomach twice daily and the ovarian glandular with meals. "Usually people who have been chronically ill have adrenals that are stressed and under-functioning," says Dr. DeMarco.<p>
In about 6 months, Rosanna reported a 75% reduction in pain. At this point, Dr. DeMarco added another element to the program in the form of a traditional naturopathic herbal formula called Turska, containing monkshood, yellow jasmine, hops, and poke root. Rosanna took this formula at the dosage of 5 drops 4 times daily for the next 6 months.<p> 
At the conclusion of 12 months of treatment, Rosanna was pain free. She had to remain vigilant about her diet, stress levels, and exposure to allergenic substances, and remain on the nutritional supplement program and natural progesterone, says Dr. DeMarco.<p>
Dr. DeMarco notes that evidence from animal and human studies indicates that exposure to or ingestion (through foods) of pesticides such as dioxin can lead to an increase in the rate of endometriosis, presumably because these chemicals mimic the action of estrogen. Dr. DeMarco also notes that many women with endometriosis are deficient in iodine and that elemental iodine supplementation has benefited some patients in whom it acts "like a natural anti-estrogen."<p>

<b>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</b><p>

When Phyllis, 55, learned that her neighbor had experienced great improvement in her rheumatoid arthritis through treatment given by Jonathan V. Wright, M.D., director of the Tahoma Clinic, in Kent, Washington, she decided to consult with Dr. Wright for help with her similar condition.<p> 
Phyllis had endured swelling, inflammation, and pain in her knees and fingers for many years and was skeptical of her conventional doctors who had dismissed diet, vitamins, and herbs as having no effect on rheumatoid arthritis. At the time of her first visit to Dr. Wright, she was taking 12 aspirin a day for pain control, but was regularly experiencing heartburn and indigestion as side effects. Her wish was to never have to use aspirin again.<p>
Dr. Wright's recommendations began with improving Phyllis' diet because, in her neighbor's words, she was "one of the worst junk-food junkies" she had ever seen. Dr. Wright suggested that Phyllis change her way of eating to only whole grains and whole, unprocessed foods, free of sugar, and that she avoid soft drinks, caffeine, nicotine, and chemical or artificial additives, flavorings, colorings, and sweeteners.<p> 
He further advised that Phyllis undergo a series of allergy sensitivity tests because "many people with rheumatoid arthritis have so many sensitivities and allergies that telling one from another at the beginning can be nearly impossible," says Dr. Wright. He cites a study in which 21 out of 22 patients with  rheumatoid arthritis who went on an allergy-elimination diet experienced noticeable improvement, usually within 10 days. The study also found that the foods most commonly associated with the allergies are grains, milk, nuts, beef, and eggs.<p> 
In addition, Phyllis was to have tests to evaluate her DHEA (an adrenal hormone) levels and her  stomach's output of hydrochloric acid and pepsin, both required for efficient digestion. Faulty digestion, says Dr. Wright, can also contribute to rheumatoid arthritis.<p>
Next, Dr. Wright proposed a series of supplements for Phyllis. Heading the list was cod liver oil (1 tablespoon, twice daily) supplemented with vitamin E (400 IU daily). The cod liver oil would help reduce inflammation and provide necessary vitmin D to Phyllis' bones. On her neighbor's advice, she had already been taking ginger capsules (9 g daily, in 3 divided doses) and Dr. Wright had her continue with this dosage. A study shows that when 6 patients with rheumatoid arthritis took ginger daily (either 5 g fresh or 1 g powdered) for 3 months, all reported a reduction in pain, an improvement in joint motion, and less swelling and stiffness.<p>
Dr. Wright also recommended a form of B3 called niacinamide (500 mg, 3 times daily) to help reduce swelling; copper sebacate (4 mg twice daily); elemental zinc (in picolinate or citrate form: 30 mg, 3 times daily); boron (3 mg, 3 times daily); chicken cartilage (2 capsules, twice daily); and a balanced multiple vitamin/mineral supplement.<p> 
Dr. Wright notes that in a study of 87 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, selenium levels were noticeably lower than average, and that those with the worst cases had the lowest selenium levels. In a study in which subjects took  selenium (200 mcg daily) for 3 months, 6 out of 8 patients had less joint pain and inflammation as a result. Research indicates that gamma linolenic acid from borage oil (an essential fatty acid) taken at the rate of 1.4 g daily for 24 weeks produced a 36% reduction in overall joint tenderness and a 41% decrease in swollen joints.<p>
Over the course of 2 months, Phyllis underwent all the requested tests and restructured her diet. "Her progress was a little slower than usual," says Dr. Wright, "but after a year she was off the daily aspirin entirely and the pain and swelling in her joints were almost completely gone." After the second year, all her joints had greater mobility but were sensitive to occasional lapses in her diet when inappropriate foods temporarily aggravated them. After 5 years on his program, Phyllis "continues to do well," Dr. Wright says.<p>
