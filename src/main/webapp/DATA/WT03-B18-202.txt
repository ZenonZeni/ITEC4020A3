<P>The PISCES-B device has started plasma-beryllium experiments in its new
location at U.C. San Diego. An improved controlled atmosphere enclosure was
constructed to assure safe operation with beryllium materials. In the
previous experimental campaign we found that a total of 600 mg of beryllium
had been eroded during materials tests. This provided us with a unique
opportunity to investigate the lost beryllium. Swipe sampling and vacuum
sampling of the PISCES-B vacuum chamber revealed that 3% of the eroded
beryllium resided as uniformly distributed loose dust within the vacuum
chamber. An additional 33% of the eroded beryllium was coated onto the
chamber wall. Filtering through a series of decreasing pore size meshes
revealed a uniform distribution of particle sizes in the respirable range
(between 10mm - 0.1mm), fewer larger particles (>50mm) were observed.
