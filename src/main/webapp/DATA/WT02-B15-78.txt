<H3>WHAT IS TYPHOID FEVER?</H3>

<P>Typhoid fever is an <B>infection spread to travelers by food or
water contaminated with the bacteria</B>, <I>Salmonella typhi</I>.
Due to poor sanitation systems, residents in developing countries are
often infected with this bacteria and unintentionally pass it on to
tourists. Incubation period is usually 10-14 days, although symptoms
of the disease can begin anywhere from 7-21 days after exposure.</P>

<H3>WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?</H3>

<P>While typhoid fever is often called a diarrheal disease, not all
patients have diarrhea. (Don't assume that if there is no diarrhea,
it's not typhoid fever.)<B> Early symptoms of typhoid fever are
flu-like: body aches and pains, weakness, loss of appetite and
continuous dull headache</B>. Fever can be either continuous or it
can come and go. A rash, with pink spots approximately 1/4 inch, may
appear on the chest and abdomen in some patients.</P>

<H3>YOU'LL BE AT RlSK IF</H3>

<P>...your travels include <B>countries with less developed sanitary
facilities for sewage disposal and water treatment</B>. The risk of
typhoid fever is greatest in Africa, Asia and Central and South
America, but is also of concern in various former Soviet Bloc
countries in Eastern Europe.</P>
