September 2, 1996</I>

<P>

The overall scope of  the Dole fiscal program is also very modest compared to the tax changes which occurred during the Reagan years.  The Dole program would reduce the top marginal tax rate to 34% whereas during the Reagan years it declined to 28%.  If Congress enacted every tax change proposed by the Dole-Kemp platform without cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus to the economy would be only $58 billion during 1998 compared to a nominal GDP of $8 trillion.  It is also quite likely that the capital gains tax cut would produce such a huge revenue windfall that the federal deficit would shrink during the twelve to twenty four months after the enactment of the Dole tax program.  As a result of the equity bull market since 1991, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. is now 95% compared to a previous all time peak of 82% in 1929 and a sixty year moving average of 48%.  If the household sector could realize capital gains with a tax rate of only 14%, there would be a realignment of portfolios on a scale so large that the Treasury would experience a massive revenue windfall.
<P>
Thirdly, if the Dole-Kemp team takes over the White House and the Republicans retain control of the White House, there would be a far greater likelihood of radical reform in the nation's hitherto uncontrolled entitlement programs than if the nation continues with its current mix of divided government or a return to full Democratic control over the executive and legislative branches.  The Republicans would be more willing to impose limitations on the growth of
Medicare spending.  There is also strong support in the Republican congressional caucus for privatization of the social security system.   The experience of other countries suggests that privatization of the social security system could have a very benign impact on U.S. interest rates by encouraging a rise in the household savings rate.   The growth of defined contribution pension plans has already helped to sustain the private savings rate in the face of a stock market boom which will depress corporate contributions to defined benefit plans.  The privatization of the social security would only accelerate this trend.
<P>
There were further signs during August that the world economy's developing countries will enjoy more buoyant growth during late 1996 and 1997 than during 1995.  Mexico reported a 7% year on year increase in total output during the second quarter while the peso has been so resilient that the Bank of Mexico has eased interest rates to the lowest level since the late 1994 peso crises.  China announced a cut in both its lending and deposit interest rates for the second time this year.  The Bank of China stresses that it will continue to restrain credit growth through non-price mechanisms such as lending quotas, but the interest rate cuts will still help to reduce the losses of the country's heavily indebted state enterprises and encourage more consumption and investment.  As China accounts for about 9% of total world output, any upturn in her economy will have important implications for commodity demand as well as trade flows in the Asia-Pacific region.  In June, the U.S. had a larger trade deficit with China than Japan but if China pursues a policy of reflation her import demand will rise and lower her trade surplus.
<P>
The economies of southeast Asia and Korea, by contrast, are now reporting a growth slowdown because of their heavy dependence upon the electronics industry.  Korea accounts for 20% of world semi-conductor production and the price of chips has fallen almost 80% this year.  The electronics sector accounts for almost two thirds of Singapore's industrial production, with much of the output being produced by the branch plants of U.S. multinational companies.  The slowdown in the sector should last for only a few quarters but it is a reminder of the trade vulnerability which still exists in many of Asia's high growth economies.
<P> 
<B><I>To summarize,</I></B> the government's data reports in the month of  September are likely to have a major impact on both investor and Federal Reserve perceptions of the intermediate term economic outlook.  If final demand continues to expand at a steady rate, there will be a sustained upturn in corporate inventory demand and production strong enough to justify at least one Federal Reserve interest rate hike before the November presidential election.  If domestic final demand slows sharply from the 4.6% growth rate which occurred during the first half of 1996, the Fed will probably be able to remain passive through year end.  The preliminary data for August suggests that the economy will display sufficient strength to justify a tightening move but the Fed is unlikely to arrive at a consensus on the question until he sees the employment and retail sales reports.  The dollar has weakened because of investors purchasing the D-mark to hedge against the risk of European monetary union being deferred.  The D-Mark could remain firm until there is more evidence of stronger European economic growth or successful fiscal policy tightening in France.  The August Tanken survey confirms the Japanese economy is recovering at a very gradual pace.  The Japanese economy's weakness will encourage the MOF to promote renewed yen depreciation during the run-up to October's IMF meeting.
