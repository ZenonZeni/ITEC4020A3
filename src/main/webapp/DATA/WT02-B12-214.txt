<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The farm value of fruits and nuts,

vegetables and melons and horticultural specialties such as mushrooms

and greenhouse/nursery crops totaled a record $34 billion in 1995,

including $10.5 billion worth of fruits and nuts, $13.3 billion

worth of vegetables, and $10.2 billion worth of specialties such

as flowers, garden plants and bulbs and Christmas trees.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US exported $9 billion worth

of FVH commodities in 1995, and FVH exports are expected to hit

almost $10 billion in 1997.  US farm exports, by contrast, are

expected to be $58 billion in 1997.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">About one-third of the value of

greenhouse/nursery crops are floriculture--cut flowers and bedding

and garden plants.  The US ($2.4 billion in farm sales in 1994,

and $3.3 billion in 1995) is second only to the Netherlands ($2.4

billion in 1994) in global floriculture production.  Italy, Germany

and other European countries also have significant floriculture

sectors, but the growth in floriculture is fastest in Latin America

(Colombia and Ecuador), Africa (Morocco and Kenya), Israel and

Asia (Thailand and Malaysia).</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US has about 10,000 floriculture

operations, and they have 843 million square feet under glass,

and 27,000 acres of open air production.  Geraniums worth $140

million to growers were the most valuable of the potted plants,

which had a grower value of $1.3 billion in 1995.  Cut flowers

were worth $521  million to growers in 1995.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Potted flowering plants such as

poinsettias were worth $679 million to growers in 1995 and foliage

plants were worth $496 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A growing segment of the greenhouse

industry involves the production of vegetables under glass; the

value of vegetables grown in greenhouses more than doubled from

$91 million in 1992 to $200 million in 1996.  In the late 1980s,

tomatoes accounted for about 40 percent of greenhouse vegetables,

followed by cucumbers, 30 percent and lettuce, 13 percent.<BR>
