<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM IV: ANY REVENUES GENERATED BY TAXING LEGALIZED DRUGS
WOULD QUICKLY EVAPORATE IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED SOCIAL COSTS
ASSOCIATED WITH LEGALIZING DRUGS. </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A favorite argument in support of legalization is that
education, health care, road building and a wide array of other
worthwhile causes would benefit from the taxes that could be
raised by legalizing drugs and then taxing them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>On the whole, it certainly seems better than sending all that
money to Colombia. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The conference participants were extremely skeptical about the
claim of a large tax windfall, and challenged advocates to prove
that the amounts of revenue potentially generated by legalization
would counterbalance the increased social costs that would result
from making drugs legal. When asked for specifics, they have no
answers. </p>

<p>Are they taking into account the erosion of the tax base as
more and more citizens are unable to work because of drug
addiction? Add to this loss the cost of health and welfare
benefits for the unemployed. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no tax windfall, large or small, right now. The only
revenue generated is the revenue generated from money and
property seizures, which is fraught with its own problems. </p>

<p>The DEA has asked the American taxpayers to support an
open-ended program of building more prisons. When they are asked
for specifics, such as how many prisons they propose to build,
they have no answers. </p>

<p>Does the DEA take into account the erosion of the tax bases by
the fact that -- by their own estimates -- two-thirds of the
people they propose to throw in prison are gainfully employed
taxpayers? Does the DEA take into account the fact that, once
these people have a prison record, they may be permanently
unemployed because no one wants to hire an ex-convict? Putting
people in prison doesn't do anything to reduce unemployment
problems, except for prison guards. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would increase.
The panel predicted that drug treatment costs, hospitalization
for longterm drug related disease, and treatment of the
consequences of family violence would further burden our already
strapped health care system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy disagreed with this point.
See the list elsewhere on these pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There is also real reason to believe that liability suits
would be brought against manufacturers and distributors of drugs
as damages to individuals increased, thereby increasing the cost
of products. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As opposed to the current situation, where there is no one to
bring a liability suit against. </p>

<p>Liability suits have not yet put the alcohol and tobacco
industries out of business, or made their products too expensive.
If this was a real concern, alcohol and tobacco would still be
the major concerns. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask legalization proponents if the alleged profits from drug
legalization would be enough to pay for the increased fetal
defects, loss of workforce productivity, increased traffic
fatalities and industrial accidents, increased domestic violence
and the myriad other problems that would not only be high income
items, but extremely expensive in terms of social decay. How much
are they willing to pay? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of fetal defects caused by alcohol are far greater
than the number for illegal drugs so this argument is a red
herring. If the DEA was really concerned about fetal defects,
they would concentrate on alcohol first. </p>

<p>The DEA acts like these problems are not here already, and
that the best method of preventing them is to throw people in
prison. In every case, these problems are already here, and
throwing people in prison is not the best approach to the
problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>Dr. William Olson, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for International Narcotics Matters, outlines the magnitude of
the social costs borne now by U.S. taxpayers because of drugs. In
his 1994 essay, &quot;Drug Legalization: Getting to No,&quot; he
provides the following: </p>

<p> 2560 percent of the homeless are addicts, whose
homelessness is in large part the result of addiction and their
inability to manage money or make rational, reasonable decisions.
They are increasingly supported at public expense. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the result of the current policy which is, in itself,
a good argument against what we are doing. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 7580 percent of the 1.2 1.5 million teenage runaways are
substance abusers, and not because prohibition made them use
drugs or run away. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, and prohibition didn't keep them from using drugs either.
Runaways are usually children who have severe problems at home
which cause them to engage in all sorts of deviant behavior. The
drug laws do not do anything to address the underlying problem.
The law only makes the runaways' problems worse if they are
caught using drugs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 3050 percent of mental patients are chemical abusers, 5060
percent of these crack and cocaine. They are largely on public
support. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The only thing this would show is that people with severe
mental problems are likely to try to self-medicate themselves. It
does not show any causal connection between drug use and
insanity, except perhaps that insanity causes greater drug use.
It says even less about what would a sensible public policy for
addressing the problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> As many as 11 percent of young mothers use drugs during
pregnancy. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is what is happening under the current system. A more
sensible approach might reduce the number. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 2.5 percent of all live births, some 100,000 babies are
born addicted to cocaine. They have lifelong learning
disabilities and emotional problems. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no support for this claim at all and the DEA knows
it. The DEA is lying. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> $50 billion is devoted annually to dealing with the health
care costs of drug addiction and its collateral costs. These will
not disappear with legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Those costs haven't disappeared with prohibition either. In
fact, every major study of the subject says that prohibition only
makes those costs greater. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There are approximately 500,000 heroin and 2 million other
substance abusers. Their care is increasingly a demand on
society. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>According to the DEA's own figures, shown above, the current
policies have had no effect on this problem at all. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There is no way to predict how much revenue would be
generated by the United States Government taxing legalized drugs.
Such a scenario depends entirely upon the parameters of
legalization, and what the policy means vis a vis sources of
drugs. If U.S. farmers were given subsidies to produce drugs (as
they are given subsidies for tobacco) the U.S. taxpayers would be
responsible for paying for these subsidies. If foreign sources of
drugs (opium or coca) were allowed to supply the raw material for
these products, an elaborate system of tariffs and trade
preferences would need to be established. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is true that there is no way to predict tax revenues until
one makes some assumptions about &quot;legalization&quot;. One of
the reasons is that the DEA doesn't have a clue how big the
market for drugs really is. This should not stop us from
recognizing that prison is a net revenue loser. </p>

<p>These are curious arguments. They bring up the question of
whether we should have subsidies for tobacco in the first place,
especially in view of the fact that it kills 100 times as many
people as all the illegal drugs combined. Why does our government
give subsidies to tobacco farmers while it throws marijuana
(hemp) farmers in prison? Our drug laws plainly make no sense at
all. </p>

<p>Trade and tariffs would be handled as they would for any other
commodity and the fact that tariffs might be complicated is not a
good argument for throwing American citizens in prison. </p>

<p>We also have to ask, who controls the trade and tariffs now?
And what are the trade and tariff rules now? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Taxes would likely push the cost of the product up. Taxing
the drugs would make them more expensive at the checkout counter.
The drug cartels do not provide a share of their receipts to
their respective governments. They are all business. Anyone going
into competition with them, including the U.S. Government, would
have to be all business too, prepared to cut prices, if
necessary, to stay in the game. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Prohibition pushes the cost of the product up. The main
difference would be that the revenues would not be used to fund
other crime. </p>

<p>The same arguments were equally true of alcohol during alcohol
Prohibition. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Legalized gambling has not put illegal gambling out of
business. In fact, legalized gambling has produced a whole new
group of people who cannot control their need to gamble. Many
states have gone into the gambling business to raise funds for
public purposes, with some success, although as more
jurisdictions get into it the profits decline. Meanwhile, bookies
ply their trade as they always have. The reason is the payoff
they offer is better than the legal gambling schemes. For every
million dollars wagered, that is, they return a higher percentage
to the winners. Again, it' s a matter of overhead. The bookies
are not trying to build schools, so they don't have to earmark a
percentage of the profits for such endeavors. So long as that is
so, they will always have a market that is loyal to them. The
same situation could logically occur if drugs were legal. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And prohibition has not put the drug dealers out of business,
it has only made them richer. </p>

<p>In places where gambling is legal, illegal bookies do not have
higher payoffs than the legal gambling schemes, except in the
case of state lotteries which have notoriously poor payoff
percentages. </p>

<p>No one contends that any scheme will entirely eliminate the
black market in drugs, and the current policy is the best
example. However, a better policy could greatly reduce many of
the problems associated with the black market, as happened with
the repeal of alcohol Prohibition. <br>
