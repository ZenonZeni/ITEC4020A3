WINTER CES 1996 -- 'DVD' SAYS IT ALL

     If there's one thing 1996 edition of Consumer Electronics Show
will have Jan. 5-8 in Las Vegas it will be a theme.  Undeniably,
that's the new, unified DVD, and manufacturers have been hoarding
mockups, prototypes and announcements for U.S. consumer electronics
industry's major showcase -- earlier editions of which launched
VCR, camcorders, CD.

     Vast amounts of consumer electronics industry's hopes are
squandered on that elusive long-sought "new product," and in its
favor, at least, is fact that entire industry is behind single DVD
format.  It almost seems that companies not showing such players in
Las Vegas will be exception rather than rule.  Scarcer still are
companies not promising DVD leadership positions or conceding they
won't be involved in first round of product deliveries.  While much
of DVD news will be generated on main floor, highlight will be
series of consecutively timed news conferences on eve of show Jan.
4 (Thurs.) by Pioneer, Sony, Thomson, Toshiba.

     While major Japanese and Korean manufacturers are expected to
show prototypes from own factories, many industry eyeballs will be
riveted on company that doesn't yet have DVD player production
capability -- TV and VCR industry leader Thomson Consumer
Electronics (TCE), which has been tantalizing industry with promise
of $500 player.

     TCE is expected to announce multiproduct deal with major
Japanese manufacturer, including DVD players that can be sold at
its target price, leveraged, perhaps, by plum of major contract for
other products.  TCE, which is buying major chunk of StarSight and
is entering services arena for first time (TVD Dec 18 p13), is
expected to make another significant move outside its traditional
field -- this time into DVD program distribution in pump-priming
effort, possibly with significant partner.

     Thomson promises DVD marketing announcements under RCA, GE and
ProScan labels, as well as unspecified software component. 
Retailers that met with TCE officials last month said company has
drafted definite plans on how it wants to bring DVD to market,
based on philosophy that first hardware dealers will be encouraged
to carry software titles.  Retailers told us TCE seems poised to
announce specific ways of helping retailers market DVD software,
but Dec. meetings revealed few specifics.

     Dolby AC-3 audio -- now component of DVD software for U.S. --
gains more momentum at show when Sony for first time will
demonstrate working prototype of AC-3 processor.  It's expected to
bill showings as "technical demonstration only" and is "not yet
prepared" to discuss specific marketing plans, Hi-Fi Vp Vic Pacor
said.  First processor is likely to be outboard rather than
integrated receiver, he said, with delivery to "coincide" with
launch of first Sony DVD players.

     In many respects, it will be traditional
entertainment-oriented CES, with gimmicks and gadgets galore, and
heavy emphasis on communication products, including all kinds of
phones, along with audio and video.  Although word "multimedia"
will be featured prominently, many of those products will be
peripherals or items already shown elsewhere.  Videogame glitz has
long since disappeared and migrated to E3 show, perhaps never to
return.  Likewise, after several forays into computer area, CES has
been unable to compete with Comdex, now a show for CE as well as
traditional business equipment dealers.

     Not that computer hardware and software manufacturers are
writing off CES completely.  It attracts nation's top CE dealers --
and that's too important a group to ignore.  IBM and Compaq will be
on show floor, displaying wares designed for CE trade but already
exposed at Comdex and elsewhere.  Microsoft is exhibiting, but its
main presence will be "at suites and doing meetings," Senior Group
Mktg. Mgr. Marty Taucher said, adding:  "It's not clear to us
whether CES will have a big role for us in the future, but we'd
like to keep our options open."

     Like other umbrella industries, consumer electronics is
splintering.  CES was first major showcase for prerecorded video,
consumer computers (a la early Apple, Commodore and Atari) and
videogames -- all of which became industries in their own right,
spawning their own shows.

     Debut of DVD and high interest in such fields as DSS,
on-screen program guides and booming projection TV presumably will
guarantee respectable attendance at this year's event.  Strangely,
as entertainment and computer products "converge," they also grow
farther apart in terms of showcasing.  And who knows what vain
hopes were tied up in designation of Compaq Pres. Eckard Pfeiffer
as 1996 CES keynote speaker.

JUSTICE DEPT. EXAMINING DVD PATENT SITUATION

     Design for central pool as one-stop supermarket for DVD patent
licenses could run into problems with U.S. Dept. of Justice (DoJ),
which recently reached agreement with Philips and Sony to modify
their CD patent pool practices.  Soon after specs for single DVD
format were agreed upon last month, contact was established between
DoJ and Sony and Philips, perhaps other patent holders, and
companies currently are formulating reply to DoJ's questions.

     At recent Tokyo DVD forum, there was talk of establishing
patent pool administered by 4 major developers -- Philips, Sony,
Matsushita and Toshiba -- to which secondary patent holders would
be invited (TVD Dec 18 p14).  DoJ's questions about DVD patents
were described by knowledgeable sources as routine, but agency did
succeed in forcing significant changes in way CD patents are
licensed.

     CD patents in past were bundled into single package
administered jointly by Sony and Philips, with Philips in charge of
actual licensing.  Thus, to make any product covered by any CD
patent, company had to take out blanket CD license.  DoJ started
probe about 2 years ago and, as one CD duplicator paraphrased
questionnaire, asked licensees for all available data including
"every letter and every agreement that you've had with these
companies."

     Voluntary settlement, quietly reached with Philips and Sony,
permits entities to obtain licenses under individual patents or
groups of patents rather than buying entire package.  "If a company
wishes to," Sony official said in Japan, "a company will be able to
obtain licenses for Sony patents from Sony," although company said
it intends to maintain procedure under which Philips handles most
patent licensing.  All present U.S. licensees will be given
opportunity to choose terms of revised licensing program rather
than continuing blanket licenses.

     In new licensing contracts, companies agree to be more
explicit about how patents can be used and when they expire, and
new agreements limit Philips' and Sony's protection in infringement
lawsuits filed by licensees, according to reports.

     CD licensing has been gold mine for patent holders as result
of explosive growth of CDs and derivative optical disc products. 
Disc Mfg. subsidiary of Quixote Corp. was quoted as saying it paid
Philips and Sony 6 cents per disc pressed in 1993 when it made 70
million discs -- about $4 million.

     In answer to our question, Sony conceded that "the revisions
will result in lower royalties, though... we do not comment on
specific royalty rates."  We were unable to obtain more detailed
information last week because of holiday closings and partial U.S.
govt. shutdown as result of stalled budget talks.

CHRISTMAS WASN'T VERY MERRY AT RETAIL

     CE retailers, many banking on holiday sales to brighten
lackluster year, were rebuked strongly by consumers who bypassed
their products despite lure of financing programs and prices at
all-time low.

     Heavy snow in parts of U.S. and lack of compelling products
were among reasons offered by retailers, but bottom line was that
consumers weren't buying what many dealers were selling, despite
such deep discounts as 10-60% off sale at Wiz.

     Retail same-store sales in 31-day shopping season were
projected to be down 3.8% overall, with Northeast and West Coast
decreasing 7.1 and 4.3%, respectively, followed by Midwest, off
4.1%;  Southwest, off 4.0%;  Mid-Atlantic, down 2.2%;  Southeast,
down 1%.  Data were provided in TeleCheck Services survey of
same-store check clearances.  Checks account for about 1/3 of
retail spending, TeleCheck said.  By week's end, analysts had
projected same-store sales at Best Buy (BB), Circuit City (CC) and
Tandy chains would be flat to slightly up, although Sears, which
does strong business in CE, was expected to show 5% rise tied
largely to clothing.  Most retailers are expected to post Dec.
results this week.

     Retail malaise spared few product categories.  TVs, VCRs and
camcorders almost uniformly were down from year ago, as was DSS,
darling of industry in 1994.  There were some bright spots in
audio, including Dolby AC-3 receivers and speakers, but retailers
reporting increases said they were result of change in merchandise
mix, rather than any specific hot-selling product.  Even music
software, onetime profit center, appeared to lose ground, caught in
price war between Circuit City and Best Buy that dropped some new
CD releases to below $10.

     PCs were top sellers but, with margins razor thin, generated
more volume than profit, retailers said.  PCs' impact on CE was
characterized by one retailer's tale of watching shoppers at
adjacent CompUSA store load up cars with PC gear while his store
stood nearly empty.  But other retailers said PCs didn't disrupt CE
business.  "I'm not sure that some consumer dollars that normally
would have gone to a big-screen TV went to a computer," Lowe's
Video Mdse. Mgr. Mark Galchutt said.  "I think in reality there was
nobody in the stores and the customers voted this year that they
were going to control their spending."

     Holiday sales didn't fail for lack of trying.  Retailers
lowered advertised VCR prices in $10-$20 increments leaving
off-brand products such as Symphonic 4-head and 2-head models at
$149 and $119, respectively.  CC advertised what appeared to be
Daewoo-made 25" set at $199.  Chasm between low-end point-and-shoot
camcorders and more featured models grew as GE's Sanyo-made 8mm
Images model appeared in ads at $279.  And cordless phones became
commodity item via $50 rebates offered by office superstore chains.

     "You could walk out of some stores with a hi-fi VCR, 25" TV
and a camcorder, having paid $650," said East Coast retailer. 
"Last year, you paid $650 just for a decent camcorder."

     Slow holiday season also may cause manufacturer and retailer
inventories to rise, although few industry observers expected
repeat of year ago.  Dealers, many of whom were left sitting with
huge amounts of inventory then, were more cautious this year and
sales to dealers in 3rd week of Dec. showed double-digit decreases
(see separate report, this issue).  "The key thing now is what is
the inventory situation going to be like after the first of the
year," Thomson Consumer Electronics Exec. Vp Joseph Clayton said. 
"I don't think it's going to be as bad as last year.  I'm not as
concerned because [retailers] didn't buy a lot.

     Yet some retailers disagreed, insisting there's enough left in
pipeline to touch off another round of price cutting in first half. 
"Whatever we've thought was going to be the low was even lower, so
there's no bottom," said Bernie's TV & Appliance Pres. Milton
Rosenberg, whose chain is honoring competitors' rebate coupons. 
"Everything is hitting new never-been-done-before low price points. 
But once the inventory levels get more realistic, I think everybody
will calm down."

     Shrinking prices and profits may push more retailers to seek
bankruptcy court protection and force others to close this year,
said analysts who predicted that another 5-6 "notable" chains will
file for Chapter 11 this year.  Among candidates will be Fretter,
which closed 190 stores last year and said it's weighing all
options, including bankruptcy.  Sluggish holiday sales also may
play role in determining future of 1995's Chapter 11 casualties
including Bradlees, Caldor, Harvey Electronics, Savemart.

     "The 2 principal factors which have caused the decline in
comparable-store sales were competitive pressures and a sluggish
retail environment," Sun TV & Appliances Chmn.-CEO Robert Oyster
said in reporting that 46-store chain's 3rd-quarter net income
dropped to $1.3 million from $4.2 million year ago as same-store
sales plunged 10%.  Sun, which expanded into Cincinnati last year,
has said it's studying several options to boost stock value,
including possible sale or merger, although Oyster has indicated
chain isn't "actively" seeking deal (TVD Nov 6 p14).

DSS PRICING FOLLOWS CE TREND -- DOWN

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300.

     Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS system that
started 1995 at $699, was being advertised by year-end at $499, and
retailers said profit was in danger of drying up.  To combat
falling prices, some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA and Sony
DSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but slower sales. 
Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected
to surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close to
million subscribers.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in
1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"
Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6
to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."

     Lower retails are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba
and Uniden enter DSS race this year with Uniden already indicating
it may price product in $499-$549 range.  In addition to DSS,
Alphastar and Echostar are planning to introduce own services --
latter partnering with Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE
retail.  Even Primestar, which primarily has leased equipment to
consumers, has tested sales through group cable operator TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony piece, which
originally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at
$648.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers,
who have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones with
hardware offered virtually free and profits made on service. 
Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar hasn't formally
released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware
retails could hit $500, with programming at $20.

     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at CE
retail, relying instead on combination of Amway, satellite
distributors, multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement with
Samsung Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiver
decoders (IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2nd
supplier.  Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell branded
product to CE dealers.  "I would think that for this product the
equipment would pass the cost curve much more rapidly than the
marketing cost of attracting a subscriber," said Alphastar
Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch
120-channel service in first quarter with hardware packages at
$600-$700.  "When that happens, it makes sense to give the box away
because the long-term value is in the subscription and the ongoing
revenue that comes from that subscription."

     But with so many satellite systems to choose from, future
hinges on manufacturers' ability to differentiate products.  Many
retailers already have said they won't give category same amount of
shelf space as other products such as VCRs, meaning that suppliers
will be battling for every square inch.

     "The big question will be whether manufacturers can create
clear differences for consumers so they can make choices," Tops
Appliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said.  "When
you can't [tell differences], you end up dealing with a price issue
and end up with $499 satellite systems."

EMERSON SUES ORION

     Emerson Radio has sued Orion Electric, claiming long-time
supplier breached contract by failing to offer it same price
decreases on select video products that it granted Wal-Mart.

     In suit filed in U.S. Dist. Court, Newark, Emerson charged
Orion and parent Otake Trading violated agreement signed in Feb.
(TVD Feb 27 p16).  Under that pact, Orion was to supply Emerson
with TVs, VCRs, VCPs and TV/VCRs in return for right to use Emerson
trademark for video products it sold to Wal-Mart.

     Orion has "failed to exploit privileges" granted by licensing
agreement, and sales of Emerson video products to Wal-Mart dropped
to $136.1 million for 6 months ended Sept. 30 vs. $181.3 million in
same period year earlier, suit said.  Orion supplied 89% of Emerson
products in 1995 and Wal-Mart accounted for 53% of Emerson sales
for fiscal year ended March 31.

     Orion failed to offer Emerson same price reductions on 19" and
25" TVs that it granted Wal-Mart in Aug., suit said.  Suit said
Emerson was paying 2% less than Wal-Mart for 25" TVs until Sept.,
when Orion dropped retailer's price $17, creating $13 gap.  Orion
also is selling 3 VCRs at Wal-Mart not offered Emerson and hasn't
supplied camcorders.

     Instead, Orion is selling Memorex camcorders to Wal-Mart,
brand licensed from Hanny Magnetics by group of ex-Emerson
executives who formed Memcorp (TVD June 26 p13), suit said. 
Emerson also has sued Memcorp, charging Pres. Barry Smith breached
partnership agreement (TVD July 10 p11).  Emerson and Smith's
Hopper Radio created E&H Partners in 1994 to distribute refurbished
Emerson products in U.S. and overseas and new items in Latin
America.

     Orion also "ignored plain meaning" of agreement requiring
company to accept returns of Emerson product from Wal-Mart starting
Aug. 1, suit said.  Manufacturer hasn't accepted  all products,
leaving Emerson with about $2.3 million worth of returned 
merchandise, suit said.  Orion contended in its suit that Emerson
intentionally delayed receiving Wal-Mart returns and began advising
chain before July 31 to send them to Orion.

     Orion sued Emerson Dec. 21 charging company violated agreement
by disclosing confidential information, including its marketing of
Emerson brand products and number of sales to Wal-Mart (TVD Dec 25
p11).  It also claimed Emerson failed to pay $2.3 million in Nov.
in effort to force parent Otake to accede to pricing and supply
demands.  Otake said Emerson's suit was "without merit" and it was
"trying to hide behind a smokescreen when, in fact, it is the
guilty party."

     In delving into history of relationship between companies that
began with opening of TV assembly plant in Princeton, Ind., in
1987, Emerson's suit said Otake Pres. Shigemasa Otake told it in
1992 that Orion brand would be sold at retail as competing product. 
At same time, Otake hired ex-Emerson executive John Bond, who was
"familiar" with company's trade secrets, suit said.

TOPS MAPS CHANGES

     After year-long experiment with noncommissioned sales, Tops
Appliance City is returning to full commissions as it seeks to
expand home office business.

     Edison, N.J., chain switched to noncommissioned sales last
Jan., but strategy didn't "achieve expected results" and resulted
in turnover of sales force, Vice Chmn.-CEO Robert Gross said.  Tops
revived commissions in Nov. and will complete conversion this month
covering 1,400-member sales force, he said.

     Commissions also are being reintroduced as Tops moves to add
4th PC brand and expand hardware to 22 items from 15, Senior
Vp.-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said, but he declined to identify
new supplier.  Tops currently carries Apple, IBM and Compaq PCs,
and Hewlett-Packard appears likely addition, sources said. 
Retailer also will merchandise current assortment of 300-400 PC
software titles more "aggressively" in terms of pricing and
promotions and expand peripheral product offerings beyond current
60 items, he said.

     Goal is to boost home office sales to 12% of revenues from
current 4-6%, Gross said.  While he conceded PC margins are low,
product appeals to middle and upper income consumers that store is
trying to attract as part of effort to soften one-time hard edge
image.

     To make room for home office offerings, Tops will
"deemphasize" videogames and isn't buying new products for next 2
months as it reviews strategy, Jones said.  "It's been difficult to
manage the software and we've been unable to get good support from
software companies," he said.  "We think it still has a place in
our stores, but we'd like to see where it can fit in."

     Return to commissions also was made with aim of increasing
extended service contract sales and boosting margins.  Service
contracts accounted for about 5% of revenues, and margins ran 23.2%
in 3rd quarter, Gross said.  At same time, Tops has consolidated
operations in stores and at hq, resulting $1.8 million saving, said
Gross, who declined to disclose how many employees were affected by
changes.  Some were moved to other positions in chain, he said.

     Tops earlier reported it had obtained site in Brooklyn for 9th
store, with plans to open by late 1996 (TVD Dec 25 p14).

RECORD OCT. AUDIO SALES

     Significant double-digit increases in portable audio and
components overcame modest declines in systems and aftermarket
autosound to push factory audio sales to 13.9% increase, setting
all-time billion-dollar record for any month, EIA Market Research
Dept. said.

     Oct. shipments climbed to $1.066 billion from year-earlier
$935.73 million.  Record result came despite 2% decline in systems
and 0.8% drop in aftermarket car audio.  Home theater boom
continued to spark once-beleaguered components category, pushing
shipments up 33.4% gain.  Portable audio shipments were up 20% in
Oct., posting monthly record sales total of $426.03 million.

     For 10 months, total shipments topped $7 billion, rising 5.9%
to $7.03 billion from year-earlier $6.64 billion.  Components led
all categories with 13.8% sales increase, other segments posting
more modest gains, portable audio climbing 5.4%, aftermarket car
audio up 3.1%, systems up 1.9%.

     Home theater boom prompted recent surge in audio components
sales, which followed many months of consecutive declines.  EIA's
Consumer Electronics Mfrs. Assn. (CEMA) credited recovery to
"white-hot sales" of speakers and AV receivers.  For Oct.,
receivers rose 41% to $66.4 million and surpassed $400 million in
sales for Jan.-Oct., CEMA said.  Turntables also were pleasant Oct.
surprise, rising 27%, said CEMA, which didn't reveal actual sales
estimate.  Overall home speaker sales doubled in Oct. from year
earlier to $84.3 million, spurred partly by fivefold rise in sales
of surround sound speaker packages for home theater, CEMA said.

     Trade group said 20% Oct. sales gain in portable audio to
record $426 million was category's best percentage rise since April
1992, when shipments jumped 20.2% over year earlier to $156.74
million.  CEMA reported 6% rise in sales of boombox stereos without
CD to $28 million, while CD boomboxes posted "healthy" 17%
increase.

     Unspecified decline in rack system sales hurt overall systems
category in Oct., CEMA said, emphasizing that sales were up 2% for
10 months.  Pattern for most of 1995 repeated itself in Oct., with
strong sales of compact systems supporting category.  Aftermarket
car audio sales "held relatively steady" in Oct., CEMA said,
without mentioning 0.8% decline in month.  Shortfall came despite
11% rise in sales of car speakers, CEMA said.

     CEMA quoted Yamaha Mktg. Dir. Tom Graham as saying that 33%
rise in Oct. components sales "gives further affirmation to the
escalating home theater ownership trend."  He said:  "Consumers are
learning that home theater is more than just video and requires
high-performance audiovideo receivers and components coupled with
quality speakers to truly recreate the movie theater experience."

     Here's EIA breakdown of factory audio sales for Oct. and
year's first 10 months:

ECHOSTAR, DBSC MERGE

     Echostar Communications and Direct Bcstg. Satellite Corp.
(DBSC) have agreed to merger that tentatively gives former
additional orbital slots for DBS.

     Proposed merger, which requires SEC approval, came last week
as Echostar successfully launched Echostar-1 on Long March at Great
Wall Industries site in China.  Satellite will carry first 65-70
channels for service scheduled to go on line in Feb.-March,
Echostar spokeswoman said.

     DBSC will become Echostar subsidiary, although role of DBSC
Chmn.-CEO Harlin Radin in merged company hasn't been determined,
Echostar spokeswoman said.  Echostar had bought 40% of DBSC in
1994.

     DBSC holds FCC DBS permits to operate 11 channels at 61.5
degrees W and another 11 at 175 degrees W, Radin said.  DBSC has
contract with Lockheed-Martin to build 2 of their new A2100
satellites, first scheduled for July 1997 delivery, other year
later, he said.  Each carries 32 transponders, 115 w each, and
contains technology that can double transmission power to 230 w
using 16 transponders.  Echostar has FCC permit to operate 21
transponders at 119 degrees W.

     Echostar's Digital Sky Highway Network (DISH) is expected to
be in service by Feb. with 65 channels and another 65 added with
launch of Echostar-2 in July-Sept. (TVD July 3 p15).  In competing
with Digital Satellite Service (DSS), Primestar and AlphaStar,
Echostar has said it plans to focus on satellite dealers, while
alliance with Philips brings Magnavox brand product to CE retailers
(TVD June 12 p21).  Although Echostar hasn't set pricing, it
indicated in prospectus that hardware would be priced around $500,
with monthly programming fee starting at $20.

     Service originally was scheduled to be available in Sept., was
delayed by investigation that followed explosion of Long March
rocket in Jan. 1995.

     While Echostar hasn't reported plans for international market,
Radin said satellite at 61.5 degrees potentially could supply
programming for Portugal, Spain and U.K. as well as Mexico, Latin
and South America.  Any plans for international service will
require FCC approval.

     Price-fix fix fixed:  Japanese customers finally will be able
to buy Matsushita products at Daei, nation's No. 1 supermarket

Thanks to recession and new vigor by Fair Trade Commission, "all

Nakauchi, who said Matsushita products now "will be priced with
common sense, according to the market standards" in Daie's 245
stores by March.
