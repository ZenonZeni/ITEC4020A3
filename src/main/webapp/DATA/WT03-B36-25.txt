ARB MODIFIES ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MANDATE

SACRAMENTO -- The Calif. Air Resources Board (ARB) staff has
proposed changes to the current Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) rule,
scheduled for introduction in 1998.  The ZEV modification, endorsed
by Governor Wilson, would retain the requirement for full
implementation by 2003.

Background

In 1994, Governor Wilson submitted California's State
Implementation Plan (SIP), under the 1990 Clean Air Act.  The plan
set forth the state's strategies to achieve clean air by
implementing cost-effective regulations which encourage the advance
of technology through market forces.  One of the most controversial
elements of the SIP is the ZEV mandate.

Under the terms of the ZEV regulation, adopted in 1990, major
automakers are required to offer vehicles with no tailpipe
emissions in 2 percent of their fleets by 1998.  The number
increases to 5 percent in 2001 and ultimately to 10 percent in
2010.

An alternative to the present rule was requested by the ARB after
auto makers' projections indicated the sales demand for lead/acid
batteries with limited mileage ranges would not appeal to enough
buyers to meet the rules.

In response to concerns such as cost/marketability, technology, the
use of hybrids and the development of infrastructure needs, the ARB
submitted to the Governor, a proposal to modify the ZEV rule, while
maintaining the ultimate long-term goal.

ARB Proposal

ARB Staff's preliminary proposal is to drop the 2 percent
requirement in the early years of the program and build up to 10
percent ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more than
3000 vehicles per year statewide must comply with the regulation.
In addition, manufacturers will receive extra ZEV credit through
2003 for ZEVs sold before 1998 and those equipped with advance
battery types that have the range and lifespan that many experts
believe is needed to make them competitive with gasoline powered
models.  Those battery types, including lithium and nickel-based
designs, are expected to be commercially available by 2001.

The staff proposal would suspend the current ZEV requirements until
2003, and propose that auto manufacturers participate in a
partnership program to promote and evaluate the development of
advanced ZEVs.  All of the exhaust, evaporative and refueling
emission reductions associated with the existing ZEV requirements,
plus a premium, would be made up by the manufacturers through the
production of cleaner cars.

ARB staff has been directed to fully develop the plan and present
it for consideration at a public hearing no later than March 1996.

In his endorsement of the ZEV modification proposal, Governor
Wilson said, "This proposal...would retain the requirement for full
implementation of the ZEV mandate by 2003.  But it will also permit
modifications that both allow enforceable emission benefits that
exceed existing requirements and at the same time encourage early
development of battery technology that will produce ZEVs the market
will accept."

STUDY RELEASED ON DIOXIN EMISSIONS FROM WASTE COMBUSTION

NEW YORK -- The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has
released a study that concludes there is no correlation between the
amount and type of chlorine in the waste constituents of combustion
facilities and dioxin concentrations measured at the stack.

The study, "The Relationship Between Chlorine in Waste Streams and
Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor Stacks," analyzed more than
1,900 test results, and concludes that limiting the chlorine
content of combustor feedstocks has no, or little, effect on the
composition or quantity of dioxin emitted.

According to ASME, the finding refutes claims by public interest
groups that there is a direct relationship between chlorine and
dioxin, or PCDD/F, emissions.  ASME says these groups have been
seeking regulations limiting the amount and type of chlorinated
waste that can be combusted in waste-to-energy plants, hazardous
waste incinerators, cement kilns, and other types of combustion
systems.

Copy Availability

A copy of the study is available from ASME, (800) 843-2763.

MARGETT INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO OVERRIDE CFC BAN IN CALIFORNIA

SACRAMENTO -- Assemblyman Bob Margett (R-Arcadia) has introduced
legislation that would repeal the federal ban on
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which became effective on Jan. 1, 1996.

AB 1996 would allow the use, possession, and production of CFCs in
California, despite the Federal ban.  The bill, known as the
California Air Conditioner Protection Act of 1996, would delay the
prohibition of freon until the year 2000.

According to Margett, "What we have, is a classic example of
state's rights.  The Tenth Amendment of the Untied States
Constitution gives states powers not delegated to the Federal
government by the Constitution.  Last time I checked, the
Constitution was silent on the issue of freon and CFCs."

"I wanted to take a reasonable approach to the freon issue.  In
giving industry a much needed extension to thoroughly study the
effects of freon on the environment while still protecting
California's consumers," Margett said.

More Information

Margett and principle co-author Senator Richard Mountjoy, are
trying to build a state wide coalition of consumers and businesses
in support of AB 1996.  For information contact Margett's office at
(916) 445-7234.

51-MONTH JAIL TERM FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE VIOLATIONS

WASHINGTON -- U.S. EPA has announced a 51-month incarceration
sentence for Reginald B. Gist, former operator of High Tech Plating
System, in Balch Springs, Texas.  Gist was sentenced for allegedly
improperly disposing and transporting of hazardous wastes generated
by his electroplating businesses.

In addition to the jail sentence, Gist is required to pay
restitution in excess of $75,000 and may not operate another
plating business.

Gist was one of the owners of the High Tech Plating from 1988 -
1990.  Following repeated notices to him by Dallas County waste
water control authorities that his business had been illegally
dumping electroplating waste into the sewer system, the sewer
connection was disconnected.  Gist admitted that he abandoned the
facility, leaving plating vats and 55-gallon drums containing more
than 70,000 gallons of hazardous wastes, including acids, cyanides
and heavy metals.  EPA cleaned up the site at a cost in excess of
$300,000.

According to court records, Gist opened a new company, Metal
Plating Systems in Forney, Texas, where liquid plating wastes were
dumped into the septic system and onto the surrounding ground.  He
also hauled liquid and solid plating wastes to property he owned at
Lake Fork, Texas.  When the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission discovered the contamination at the Forney facility,
Gist was ordered to remove the contaminated soil and dispose of it
properly.

As part of the pleas agreement, Gist admitted that rather than
dispose of the contaminated soil properly, he transported it to the
Lake Fork property where it was either buried or dumped on the
ground.  Gist left the Forney location in 1992 and moved Metal
Plating Systems to Terrell, Texas.

On Sept. 22, Gist pled guilty to one count of unlawful disposal of
hazardous waste at Balch Springs and one count of unlawful
transportation of hazardous waste from the Forney and Terrell
locations to Lake Fork, in violation of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA).  EPA estimates that the Agency spent in
excess of $450,000 to cleanup the Terrell Facility, alone.

JUDGE REVERSES RULING ON FISH AND GAME CEQA FEES

SACRAMENTO -- Sacramento Superior Court Judge Jeffery Gunther has
reversed his previous ruling and ordered the Dept. of Fish and Game
to collect fees charged for the implementation of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the review of environmental
impact documents of major developments in accordance with Fish and
Game Code Section 711.4.

The ruling was the result of an action taken by the California
Association of Professional Scientists (CAPS).  CAPS sued Fish and
Game to set aside a settlement agreement with private land owners
that required the department to cease and desist the collection of
approximately $3 million in annual fees.  Judge Gunther had
previously approved the settlement agreement.

CAPS argued that Judge Gunther's approval of the settlement was
unconstitutional.  Section 3.5 of the State Constitution prohibits
an administrative agency from refusing to obey a state law in the
absence of a ruling from an appellate court that the law is
unconstitutional.

According to CAPS, the settlement that was overturned had been
entered into after Judge Gunther ruled the fees statute was
unconstitutional.

In reversing his approval of the settlement, Judge Gunther strongly
expressed his unhappiness with the constitutional provision
prohibiting agencies from refusing to enforce statute law on the
basis of a Superior Court decision, but ultimately acknowledged
that the Constitution controls.

CAPS says an appeal of the court's decision in likely.

CAPS represents approximately 2,400 state employed scientists,
including several hundred biologists and related resource
professionals working for the Dept. of Fish and Game.

The fees generated by the Environmental Review Procedure, for which
the fees are collected, result in a significant portion of the
department's annual budget.

LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LAB TO ASSIST CAL/EPA WITH TECHNOLOGY
EVALUATIONS

SACRAMENTO/LIVERMORE -- Under a Memorandum of Agreement singed last
month between Cal/EPA's Dept. of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)
and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, scientists and
engineers from the Lab will help develop and commercialize new
environmental technologies.  The lab will provide personnel and Lab
facilities to evaluate new environmental technologies seeking
certification under the Environmental Technology Certification
program.

According to DTSC, the agreement:

*Creates a wider, more diverse pool of available scientific and
engineering expertise available for the testing of technologies.

*Makes available additional scientific, testing and laboratory
facilities to evaluate environmental technologies, and

*Enhances the credibility of the certification through the
synergism of California's reputation for environmental standards
and Lawrence Livermore's reputation for technology development.

"Our partnership brings together the field and regulatory
experience of Cal/EPA with the research and development experience
of the Lab," said Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock.  "This
combination will provide a tremendous resource to the environmental
technology industry and allow for greater capability to certify
more technologies."

TWO ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES ENTER CIRCULATION

SACRAMENTO -- Secretary of State Bill Jones has announced that two
new environmental initiative measures have entered circulation for
petition signatures.

Beverage Container Recycling Program.  Wine and Liquor Containers.

This initiative proposes to amend the existing recycling law to add
wine and liquor containers to beverage containers on which
distributors are assessed a charge.  If adopted, the measure would
increase funding for recycling and anti-litter programs from
program-generated revenues.  In addition, it would provide
financial incentive for sterilization and refilling of recycled
containers.

The estimated annual cost of the state recycling program would
increase by approximately $2 million.  Additional recycling program
revenue increases are estimated at $20 to 25 million annually.

More Information

The proponent of this initiative is Mark Murray of Californians
Against Waste, (916) 443-5422.  He must submit 433,269 signatures
of registered voters to county officials by May 30, 1996.

Radioactive Waste Disposal. Initiative Statute.

This initiative would prohibit the disposal of low-level
radioactive waste in the state by means of burial.  It would
require low-level radioactive wastes generated by medical,
biomedical or biotechnical industries to be managed using
retrievable and monitored facilities.

The proposal would also establish a third party liability fund for
injury to persons or property from waste disposal, paid for through
surcharge on waste generators.  It also exempts the state from
costs or liability for waste storage or disposal, except for wastes
generated by state and local agencies.

It is estimated that the measure would result in one-time state and
county costs ranging from $8 million to $13.5 million, and ongoing
annual costs of approximately $1 million to $2 million.

More Information

The proponent of this initiative is Ernest Goitstein, (415) 369-
6690.  He must collect 433.269 signatures of registered voters by
June 3, 1996.

GOVERNOR CALLS SPECIAL SESSION FOR CONTINUATION OF METHYL BROMIDE
REGISTRATION

SACRAMENTO -- At the end of December, Governor Pete Wilson called
a special session of the California Legislature to consider
legislation that would allow the continued registration of methyl
bromide and pentachlorophenol.

Methyl bromide is a widely used pesticide to control insects,
mites, rodents, plant diseases, nematodes, termites, and for
pretreating soil prior to planting a number of agricultural corps.
Pentachlorophenol is a wood preservative used by all major utility
companies in California to protect power and telephone poles from
destruction by wood-eating pests.

Currently, some of California's major trading partners including
Japan, Korea and Mexico require methyl bromide treatment on
agricultural products prior to shipping.  New Zealand and Australia
require all shipments of products in wooden crates or pallets to be
treated with it to prevent pests from entering their countries.

Existing law requires manufacturers of pesticides to conduct health
effect studies and submit them to the state for evaluation.
Current law requires that the registration of methyl bromide be
suspended after March 30, 1996, if the necessary studies are not
submitted by then.

According to a recent study released by the Calif. Dept. of Food
and Agriculture (CDFA) the state could loose up to $346 million in
revenues and 9,894 full-time jobs annually, from the suspension of
methyl bromide registration.

Ongoing scientific debate between Cal/EPA and U.S. EPA regarding
how these studies should be conducted, delayed the initiation of
the studies.  Consequently, the last toxilogical study for methyl
bromide will not be completed until December 1997.

At the end of the last legislative session, SB 808 by Senator Dick
Monteith (R-Modesto) and Assemblyman Peter Frusetta (R-San Benito)
that would have resolved this problem, failed passage.  A special
session provides a practical way to extend the statutory deadline
for the submittal of the last methyl bromide study.  The special
session will run concurrently with the regular Legislative session.

At this time, in the Third Special Session, SB 1 (Henry Mellow, D-
Monterey),  SB 2 (Monteith) and AB 1 (Frusetta) have been
introduced.  Each bill would extend the methyl bromide study
deadline to December 1997.  Last week AB 1 passed the Assembly
Appropriation Committee (11-4).  It is currently scheduled for
hearing on the Assembly Floor.  SB 1 and SB 2 are scheduled for
hearing in the Senate Health and Human Services Committee on Jan.
24.  (For more information on these bills, see the California Bill
Report.)

Legislation passed during a special session go into effect on the
91st day after adjournment of the special session, while those
passed during a regular session of the Legislature go into effect
on January 1 of the following year.

WORKER PROTECTION STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION HEARINGS SCHEDULED

SACRAMENTO -- The Dept. of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) has scheduled
six workshop/hearings throughout the state on the implementation of
the federal Worker Protection Standard (WPS) in California.

Current California regulations place requirements on employers of
pesticide handlers and fieldworkers.  Currently the handler portion
of the regulations is applicable to all pesticide use situations:
the fieldworker portion is applicable to employees working in
treated agricultural fields; handler regulations cover protection
of study participants, hazard communication, emergency medical
care, training, personal protective equipment, decontamination
facilities, medical supervision, change areas, light, and closed
handling systems.  Fieldworker regulations encompass posting, and
reentry into, treated fields, training, emergency medical care,
decontamination facilities, and hazard communication.

By implementing the WPS in California, the coverage of both the
handler and fieldworkers of the WPS are limited to the commercial
or research production of agricultural plant commodities on farms,
forests, greenhouses, and nurseries.  Although the WPS addresses
most, but not all, of the same areas covered by current California
requirements.

The following hearings have been scheduled on Worker Protection
Standards:

Salinas - February 21

Salinas Community Center (Santa Lucia Room), 940 North Main St.,
Salinas, 93901.

Sacramento - February 26

Secretary of State Auditorium, 1500 - 11th St., Sacramento, 95814.

Visalia Area - February 28

UC Kearney Agriculture Center, 9240 South Riverbend Ave., Parlier,
93648.

San Diego Area - March 6

San Diego County Farm Bureau, 1670 East Valley Parkway, Escondido,
92027.

ADDITIONAL COMMENT PERIOD FOR EXTENDED PESTICIDE USE

WASHINGTON -- Under the terms of a recent settlement agreement,
U.S. EPA will provide additional opportunity for public comment
before the Agency extends the time period during which "existing
stocks" of certain canceled pesticides can be used.

The settlement resolves a lawsuit brought by the United Farm
Workers of America (UFW) against EPA.  UFW sued the Government on
behalf of migrant workers who were exposed to the pesticide,
mevinphos, which was later canceled.  The workers learned that EPA
extended the period during which the manufacturer could continue to
sell "existing stocks" of the canceled pesticide.

Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA), a manufacturer's registration of a pesticide can be
canceled if the pesticide poses an unreasonable health or
environmental threat.  In some cases, upon the request of a
manufacturer, EPA can permit the sale and use of existing stocks of
the canceled pesticides.

Through the settlement, EPA has agreed to go beyond the existing
terms of FIFRA, and provide public notice and an opportunity to
comment before it modifies the time period during which existing
stocks of certain canceled pesticides can be used.

"[This] settlement is part of EPA's ongoing efforts to increase
public involvement in the pesticide regulatory process," said Lynn
Goldman, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides,
and Toxic Substances.

EPA is expected to publish its policy early this spring.

CROSS CONTAMINATION OF PESTICIDE PRODUCTS POLICY RELEASED

WASHINGTON -- Last month, a new policy that sets numerical limits
of contamination for all categories of pesticides, above which U.S.
EPA would consider the contaminant to toxicologically significant,
was released by the Agency.

In a notice issued to pesticide registrants (PR Notice 95-X), EPA
explained the Agency's new interpretation of what "toxicologically
significant" means in terms of contamination of pesticide active
ingredients, particularly as it pertains to the contamination of
one pesticide by another.  The new policy will allow EPA to focus
its attention on the contamination issues that pose a risk for
health and the environment.

According to the objectives in the PR notice, the new policy
should:

* set a clear standard that can be readily applied by the regulated
industry, as well as EPA;

* maintain accountability of the product form the producer to end
user;

* minimize the possibility that cross contamination will pose a
significant problem; and

* not preclude marketplace or private solutions to correct problems
that do arise.

Under the new policy, which goes into effect after a 60-day comment
period, EPA will move from a "zero-based" to a "risk based"
approach in considering the "toxicological significance" of
contamination of one pesticide by another.  Risk considerations
include potential human health effects from both dietary and non-
dietary exposure, ecological effects, potential groundwater
contamination and the potential for leaving unwanted residues on
food.

EPA has concluded that potential toxicity to plants by the
contaminant poses the greatest potential for harm, given the low
concentration of contamination being considered.

A contaminant that is toxicologically significant must be reported
to EPA for a determination of its potential effects and possible
corrective or regulatory action.

More Information

Copies of the new policy are available form EPA's Office of
Pesticide Communications, (703) 305-5017.

TWO PESTICIDES BANNED TO REDUCE POLLUTION IN BAY AND ESTUARIES

SACRAMENTO -- Emergency regulations to prohibit the sale and use of
pesticide products containing copper sulfate or tributyltin (TBT)
in nine Bay Area counties, have been announced by Cal/EPA.  Both
pesticides have been proven harmful to San Francisco Bay and its
estuaries.

The ban affects copper sulfate-containing pesticide products that
are poured into sewers and drains to kill plant and tree roots.
The affected TBT products are used in cooling towers in larger air
conditioning systems to control microorganisms that can cause
fouling.  The pesticides are prohibited for use in Alameda, Contra
Costs, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano,
and Sonoma counties.

Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock said, "Because we know that these
products have important uses, our scientists developed information
on alternative methods for controlling root intrusion in sewer
lines and microorganisms in many air conditioning systems.  This is
an excellent example of how environmental and economic progress can
be successfully combined."

UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK LEAKAGE MAY BE LESS OF A THREAT

SACRAMENTO -- According to a recent study by Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL), the impact of some leaking underground
storage tanks on the environment maybe less than previously
thought.

The independent study supports increasing evidence that many sites
within California present a low risk to the environment once the
tanks have been removed, and may require only monitoring to ensure
that the contaminated plume is stable and not contaminating other
areas.

In response to the study, recent state and public concern regarding
expensive regulatory oversight in the cleanup of leaking
underground fuel storage tanks, the State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB) has advised the state Regional Water Quality Control
Board and local oversight Programs to halt active remediation and
begin monitoring programs in cases containing low risk groundwater
exposure.  According to Cal/EPA, this will assure that State
attention is focused on better remediation of high risk sties and
situations.

Cal/EPA Secretary James Strock said, "This initial act by the Water
Board is among the first regulatory reforms resulting from Governor
Wilson's recent executive Order W-127-95.  We heard about the
urgency of this issue in our public forums in November, and now we
are taking action."

The report, "Recommendations to Improve the Cleanup Process for
California's Leaking Underground Fuel Tanks," was presented to the
SWRCB in October.  The report also recommends that passive
bioremediation be considered the primary remediation tool in most
cases, once the fuel leak source has been removed.

Typically, low risk cases involve shallow groundwater with a
maximum depth to water less than 50 feed and without drinking water
wells screened in the shallow groundwater zone with 250 feet of the
leak.

CPUC SETS UTILITY FUNDING LIMITS FOR LOW EMISSION VEHICLES -- The
Calif. Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has set the dollar amount
utilities can recover in rates to fund low emission vehicle (LEV)
programs for the next six years.  The combined utility LEV program
funding request totaled $426,652,000.  The CPUC approved
$171,421,000 (40 percent) of this amount.  Ratepayers will fund
$132,408,000.  Shareholders will fund the remainder.  The LEV
programs are intended to comply with Legislative mandate to
facilitate purchase and use of electric and natural gas vehicles in
California.

STUDY CONFIRMS HEALTH BENEFITS OF ACID RAIN REDUCTION -- A recent
study released by U.S. EPA estimates the value of health benefits
from the reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from
utilities, under the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act
Amendments, at between $3 billion and $11 billion for 1997.  The
report focused on 31 eastern states where sulfates are a
substantial problem.
   It is estimated that by 2010, when the acid rain reduction
program will be fully implemented, the annual U.S. health benefits
will range between $12 billion and $40 billion.  According to the
report, reductions in premature deaths account for approximately 88
percent of the total health benefits; reductions in the number of
new cases of chronic bronchitis account for another nine percent of
the total.  More Information:  Copies of the study are available
from the Acid Rain Hotline, (202) 233-9620.

ELECTRIC VEHICLES

GOVERNOR COMMENDS GENERAL MOTORS ON VEHICLE DEBUT -- Governor Pete
Wilson has congratulated John Smith, Jr., chairman of the General
Motors (GM) Corporation, on the debut of the EV1, the first
purpose-built electric vehicle to be available to the public in
Southern California later this year.  "Making this revolutionary
vehicle available to the public will inevitably accelerate the
competition to produce zero emission vehicles, and will help us
reach California's mandate of having 10% of the automobiles for
sale be ZEVs [Zero Emission Vehicles] by 2003," the Governor said.
   GM introduced the EV1 on January 4.  The two-seat vehicle will
be marketed this fall.  The company has spent approximately $350
million on electric car development.

Assembly Bills

AB 1983 (MILLER) CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS
   Existing law prohibits the prescribed manufacture or sale of
specified chlorofluorocarbons or aerosol propellants containing
a chlorofluorocarbon.  Existing law limits, as specified, the
sale of motor vehicles equipped with CFC-based products, and
requires motor vehicle manufacturers to submit specified
information in that regard to the State Air Resources Board.
   This bill would repeal those provisions.  The bill would
provide that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
person may possess, use, manufacture, purchase, install,
transport, or sell chlorofluorocarbons, and the possession, use,
manufacture, purchase, installation, transportation, or sale of
chlorofluorocarbons does not subject any person, this state, or
any political subdivision of this state to any penalty, fine,
retaliatory action, or other punitive measure.

AB 1996 (MARGETT) FREON: AIR-CONDITIONING
   Existing law prohibits the prescribed manufacture or sale of
specified chlorofluorocarbons or aerosol propellants containing
a chlorofluorocarbon.  Existing law limits, as specified, the
sale of motor vehicles equipped with CFC-based products, and
requires motor vehicle manufacturers to submit specified
information in that regard to the State Air Resources Board.
Existing federal law prohibits the production or use of certain
chlorofluorocarbons.
   This bill would provide that, notwithstanding any such
provision of law, until January 1, 2000, the production,
manufacture, use, and sale of freon for express use in
automotive and home air-conditioning units and home appliances
does not subject any person, this state, or any political
subdivision of this state to any penalty, fine, other punitive
measure, or enforcement action.
1/4/96 INTRODUCED
STATUS: ASSEMBLY DESK
-----------------------------------------------------------------
AB 2009 (CORTESE) WASTE: SOLID WASTE FACILITIES: PERMITS
   Existing law, the California Integrated Waste Management Act
of 1989, regulates the management of solid waste.  The act
requires the California Integrated Waste Management Board and
certified local enforcement agencies to perform specified
functions with regard to the regulation of solid waste
management, including the issuance and enforcement of solid
waste facilities permits.  The board is required to concur or
object to the issuance, modification, or revision of any solid
waste facilities permit within 60 days of the board's receipt of
any proposed solid waste facilities permit. However, the board
is required to object to the permit and to submit its
determination and specific objections to the local enforcement
agency, the applicant, and the city or county within which the
facility is located, until a countywide integrated waste
management plan has been approved by the board, if the board
makes a determination concerning specified diversion
requirements.
   This bill would delete that requirement that the board object
to the permit until the countywide integrated waste management
plan is approved.
   The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately
as an urgency statute.

STATUS: ASSEMBLY DESK

Senate Bills

SB 1371 (MELLO) ECONOMIC POISONS
   Under the Birth Defect Prevention Act of 1984, the Department
of Food and Agriculture was required by December 31, 1985, to
identify pesticide active ingredients that the department
determined had the most significant data gaps and widespread use
and that were suspected to be hazardous to people.
   Under the act, the Director of Pesticide Regulation also was
required on January 15, 1992, to issue a notice of the impending
suspension of the registration of those pesticide products
containing an active ingredient with a significant data gap for
which the registrant had not submitted required data by December
31, 1991.
   However, existing law provides that notwithstanding these
provisions, if the director finds that delays in submitting the
mandatory health effects studies were primarily caused by
actions of the Department of Pesticide Regulation, the director,
with the concurrence of the Secretary for Environmental
Protection, may extend the deadlines for submitting the
mandatory health effects studies for certain ingredients,
including, among others, pentachlorophenol and methyl bromide.
   In addition, under the act, no pesticide product containing
specified active ingredients for which the required studies have
not been submitted by March 30, 1996, shall remain registered
in this state after that date.
   This bill would revise these latter provisions to specify, in
addition, that no pesticide product containing methyl bromide
or pentachlorophenol for which the required studies have not
been submitted by December 31, 1997, shall remain registered
after those respective dates.
   This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately
as an urgency statute.

rerefined automotive lubricants, recycled antifreeze, recycled
solvents, and recycled paints, as defined.  Existing law
requires the purchase of the listed materials only when they are
available, of a fitness and quality equal to their nonrecycled
product and are not more costly than 5% of the lowest price
quoted by suppliers.  Existing law would repeal on January 1,
1997.
   This bill would delete the repeal date of January 1, 1997,
thereby continuing the requirement that all state agencies
purchase the listed materials indefinitely.
