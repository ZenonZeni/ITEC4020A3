<LI>Anybody but Hillary
<LI>Harry Browne {libertarian nominee) ... Of all the candidates now availabel, Mr. Browne is most devoted to Liberty & Constitutionally constrained government.  Failing the election of mr.

<LI>Harry Browne-- The only person who realizes government makes more of a mess than it solves.
<LI>HARRY BRWONE
<LI>Bill Clinto.  I believe he has done a good job.  I think he has a handle on the issues that are domestically important for this country, economic opportunities and reducing the national debt, creating a positive outlook toward the future.
<LI>Harry Browne: Government doesn't work and cannot work because it is based on coercion.
<LI>Harry Browne  We need a better economy which Washington is not capable of giving us. We don't need the government in our private lives
<LI>Clinton.  He is not an ideologue.  He at least understands the problems, although he has difficulty articulating the solutions.  He understands that there is a need for a national government, unlike those who would eliminate the federal government.
<LI>Clinton, because Bob Dole is too old.
<LI>Harry Browne: Libertarian ideology works in real world.
<LI>I would like to see Harry Browne win in November. He is the only candidate willing to dramatically change the government.
<LI>Harry Browne, because as he says, "Gov't doesn't work."  I want minimal gov't
<LI>Bob Dole - Best candidate for the job
<LI>Harry Browne - stands for less government
<LI>If the choice is Clinton or Dole, I will choose Clinton, since he is more open minded and less set in his ways.  However, I believe there are better people, such as Alan Keyes and Ralph Nader.  Unfortunately, they have little chance of winning.  If you want more, I have plenty of opinions.
<LI>Harry  Brown. Impresses me as principled, consistant, logical, well thought out. I have heard him questioned and he is all of the aforementioned and impressively so.

<LI>Clinton\Gore, the economy is good, the deficit is dropping, and inflation seems to be holding even with a fairly hot economy, unemployment is down, sounds like people are positive about spending for high ticket items. I believe a lot of economists are surprised.
<LI>Harry Browne - Libertarians are the only party whose goals are true to the philosophies and concepts upon which this country was founded... INDIVIDUAL liberty, rights, and responsibilities.  Government IS the problem... and always has been.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>bod do
<LI>Harry Brown, because he is tho only one serious about limiting government.
<LI>Bill Clinton - Bob Dole does not have any idea what the average American is dealing with.  He has his congressional retirement, medical coverage, and more money than he knows what to do with.  Bob Dole needs to be out of politics for a while and get back 
<LI>Harry Browne, to reduce the government burden and restore common sense to America.
<LI>bob Dole
<LI>Harry Browne. Because only he will cut government.

<LI>BILL CLINTON  INTELLIGENT SPEAKER
<LI>Nader! because he actually has his head screwed on and understand the importiance of the enviroment
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne... he understands what individual freedom means and has thorough understanding of property rights and the absolute importance of keeping our experiment in freedom going by getting politicians to adhere to the constraints of the Constitution.
<LI>Clinton-- no better viable progressive alternative
<LI>Bob Dole  uor country needs moral leadership.
<LI>Harry Browne. Only candidate that offers to significantly reduce government oppression. 
<LI>Harry Browne  I want to see him included in the debates, but more inportantly I like what he has to say. He is a fine speaker who seems to say what he means and means what he says.
<LI>I don't like any of the choices we are given. The system eliminates capable people by making certain that only people that owe obligations to the party can be candidates. These limitations begin when you first attempt to enter politics.
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only canditate who wants to shrink the federal government and give me back my freedom, money, and self responsibility. He is the oppisite of the socialist candidates Clinton\Dole.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Richard Lamm because he supports the future generations (ie balanced budget, social security/medicare reform) by protecting us from all that debt we will inherit.
<LI>Harry Browne clearly is best choice for President. He is honest,brilliant, understanding of what needs to be done, and has the will and ability to carry is through to make a free society basist on The Constitution and The Bill of Rights, to vote anyone is a wasted vote. 
<LI>Bob Dole, Mr. Clinton is a digrace and should be impeached.
<LI>Any person believing in practical Libertarian principles.
<LI>Clinton, because things have been pretty quiet these past four years than they have been my entire life.  The president can't control the stupidity of others; he can only control his own stupidity.  And I believe he's doing fine.

<LI>Clinton, He has a record of reducing the deficit, stimulating the economy, while concentrating on education and the environment
<LI>Ralph Nadar
<LI>Clinton. Good balance with Republican majority
<LI>Harry Browne in hopes of ending government's image of a "servent" to the people because instead it has become a slave master for utilitarian goals.
<LI>Bill Clinton, because of his policy this country has reduced the deficit and has eased many foreign tensions, albeit while antagonizing others.

<LI>Robert K. Dornan - One word...LEADERSHIP!

<LI>Harry Browne because we need LESS government.
<LI>Harry Browne.  To shut down most of the Government
<LI>I would LOVE to see Harry Browne elected as president. Browne is the ONLY candidate who has respect for the constitution.  His offer to do away with income tax forever if we are willing to give up all government programs is the best offer around. Check out Brownes site at http://www.harrybrowne96.org to find out why everyone is WILD ABOUT HARRY. 
<LI>Bob Dole,  Powell isn't running
<LI>Harry Browne, so he can give as his reason to refuse to sign bills that he believes them to be unconstitutional.  
<LI>Pat Buchanan - He has a anti-globalist platform that America needs right now to fend off the economic traitors that want to sell it to the highest bidder.
<LI>Harry Browne. End the Income Tax. Abolish the IRS. Let my people go!
<LI>The economy is good, I think President Clinton has made mistakes, but has learned and adjusted to the job.  He is bright, and I feel confident he has the heart to make tough, but fair decisions.  I feel President Clinton will continue to serve the country well.

<LI>Al Gore : strongest environmental advocate of all
<LI>Harry Browne--he makes sense!
<LI>BROWNE-HE KNOWS TO KEEP THE DESTRUCTIVE HAND OF GOV'T AWAY FROM PEACEFUL FOLKS

<LI>Clinton because I don't trust Dole 
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He is the only candidate combining a respect for the leaders in our society with a respect for those who are less fortunate.  In theory, I'm Libertarian, but I don't think American society is intelligent enough to prosper for all under Libertarian philosophies.
<LI>Bill Clinton, I don't want to be living in a church state
<LI>Harry Browne  -  He is our only hope of reducing government
<LI>Clinton- best chance for working people
<LI>Clinton...better off now than 4 yrs ago
<LI>Harry Browne; he recognizes that government IS the problem
<LI>Bill Clinton  The only viable candidate that concerns himself with the people of the country.
<LI>Harry Browne, because his ideas about dismantling govt. programs and turning money over to those dependent on Social Security sounds like a great idea.  Those my age and below, (and probably quite a few older) will never see any of the money they "put into" Social Security.
<LI>Harry Browne, because only Libertarians mean what they say.
<LI>Harry Browne. For reasons see his book, "Why Government Doesn't Work." Also see his website address @http:/www.HarryBrowne96.org

<LI>I cannot waste my vote by voting against my conscience and beliefs. I cannot vote for anyone other than the Libertarian candidate, Harry Browne.
<LI>Harry Browne, No other candidate truly represents change, they stand for the status quo which is socialism
<LI>Bob Dole, because I think a re-elected Bill Clinton is a very dangerous idea!
<LI>Harry Browne, in politics, as in genetics, (ie., cattle breeding) you must reach further than the goal to be able to achive it.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is not a career political parasite like Clinton & Dole.  Nor is he a part of the political establishment as the other 2 major candidates are. 
<LI>Bill Clinton,  even though he is a moderate, and that is the mood of the majority of the electorate, he hasn't demonised the government and instead believes in fixing the problems (of which can be found in any human endeavor)
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate who is uncompromising in his proud support of the Bill of Rights
<LI>Former Gov. Lamm of Colo. - has a better grasp of the national angst with a well developed agenda to solve the country problems. He's more on target than the Libertarians
<LI>David Duke because he will help the White Race to survive
<LI>Bill Clinton.  His record is much better than Dole's form my view point
<LI>Harry Browne - "Huge Tax cuts NOW! Huge Spending Cuts NOW! A Balanced Budget NOW!" Not seven years from now!
<LI>Undecided 
<LI>Ross Perot. He's not my 1st choice, but I believe him to be more sincere and honest than Bill Clinton, and more capable and driven Bob Dole. For this, I can overlook his personality flaws.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate who can bring prosperity back to America, and solve our moral crisis.
<LI>Harry Browne. He respects the Constitution.

<LI>Harry Browne. Smaller government, less taxes, greater individual rights and freedoms consistent with the original framers of our Consitution, etc. etc. etc.
<LI>Harry Browne. Someone has to be willing to begin reversing the "government has an answer for everything" syndrome.
<LI>Harry Browne - Clinton & Dole are part of the problem and have no idea how to fix what's wrong with the country.
<LI>Harry Browne  -  Reduce the size of the federal government
<LI>Harry 
<LI>HARRY BROWNE, BECAUSE HE WOULD TRULY REDUCE GOVERNMENT IN ALL AREAS, WHICH IS ALL I REALLY WANT
<LI>Harry Browne. His positions are most closely those I support.
<LI>Bob Dole: Wouldn't have been my first choice, Conservatives should have help advance other candidates
<LI>Harry Browne - to protect the indivudual (we all are individuals) from the power of the elite in the name of the majority.
<LI>President Clinton.  I feel that he has done a good job as president, and the nation is doing as well as can be expected with the current problems we are facing.
<LI>Harry Browne; government is too large
<LI>A return to strict adherance to the Constitution and Bill of Rights and rid this nation of the War Powers Act of 1933
<LI>Bill Clinton will win re-election because the economy if fairly strong, the United Staes is at peace, and Bob Dole is a very week candidate.

<LI>harry browne, the only candidate who wants to get the government out of our lives and return freedom back to the American people.

<LI>Harry Browne is my choice for President because he is the only candidate who knows the role the federal government was supposed to have in our lives and is the only one willing to put it in its place.
<LI>Harry Browne - He's honest, uncompromised, non-politicaly motivated, he has an honest love for the united States of America (Yes, small u) and he understands what this (once great) nation was founded upon... the Constitution - a document I miss, because it certainly doesn't exist in the U.S. anymore.
<LI>Bill Bradley, who is experienced, thoughtful, and principled.  But he isn't running.  I'll probably vote for Clinton, because (1) there is no way I would ever vote for Dole and (2) Clinton would prevent the right-wing Congress from running amok.
<LI>Harry Browne. Because, no other candidates advocate any concrete plan for changes, but rather business as usual in the already unresponsive and behemoth system. 
<LI>Harry Browne - He's the only one that's for reducing the size of the Federal government
<LI>Harry Browne--  he's most likely to reduce the Federal Gov't
<LI>browne, Less government, taxes, spending. Strict adherence to the bill of rights and the constitution.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is a Libertarian.
<LI>Bill Clinton-- already dong a great job
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate who believes in the freedom of the individual as long as one does not interfere with someone else's freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne, because Bill and Bob are so similar it's become hard to tell the apart. Browne is the only man with an real agenda for change--namely, cutting government back down to size.
<LI>Harry Brown. because he speaks the trurth
<LI>Harry Browne -- I totally agree with the views of Harry Browne and the Libertarian Party.
<LI>Harry Browne. He is the only candidate that will take this country back to what it was intended to be. A country where the government exists to protect the peoples right to life, to liberty, to the acquisition and possession of property, to security, and to the pursuit of happiness without interference from outside entities; not to provide these things (i.e. take from some to provide to others).  The government was never intended to instill and insure an outcome based society, but to protect the right 
f individuals to pursue, or to not, there own goals, in their own way, by their own means.  Government doesn't work and Harry Browne knows this and he will do what it takes to get the government to leave the people alone.
<LI>Harry Browne- The man has some good ideas that I think will work.We are just a few steps from slavery now and if something doesen't change in the near future the great American experiance will be doomed.
<LI>Bob Dole..because Clinton is a pot smoking, gay-loving, draft-dodging, womanizing bastard.  Character DOES matter..and Dole has it.
<LI>Bill Clinton because of the far right
<LI>Harry Browne-downsize government, reduce taxes, get the gov't out of my life.
<LI>Harry Browne, Because Government Doesn't Work!
<LI>Harry Browne;  only candidate who is for FREEDOM and personal responsibility.
<LI>Bill Clinton, Dole is way to conservitive and is trying to force Christian viewpoints on the country as a whole.
<LI>Ralph Nader, because I respect his opinions, and I despise the other candidates.
<LI>Pat Buchanan-Tells it like it is.
<LI>Browne. Change is needed, it's not going to come from Reps or Dems.
<LI>Not Republican, not Democrat. To open the process
<LI>Underlying the success of the American experiment in human liberty is the idea that all individuals have the right to be free from interference from any other person or group of persons so long as they respect the right of others to do the same. Harry Bro
<LI>Harry Browne, to take the Federal government out of the problem-solving business and limit its functions to national defense and protection of individual liberties; to promote a general atmosphere of tolerance for others' preferences as long as they don't
<LI>Clinton-  The best choice.
<LI>Harry Browne: for much less govt and taxes; for a better economy for all
<LI>I would prefer a conservative other than Dole: however, I will vote for him rather than see Clinton re-elected.  Dole is a patriot.  He will insure the appointment of more conservative judges, and cabinet members. He would sign s lot of the legislation in "the contract with America".  I believe he will lower taxes and try to cut off the long arms and deep pockets of the Federal government.  This government of ours is a beast that has far reaching tenticles that are destroying this country and the ideal
 itterated in the Constitution.  I am ashamed and embarassed by our present President.  God help us, if he is re-elected.
<LI>Forbes/Gingrich/Gramm or any candidate who wants to cut taxes and lessen the influence of government on people's lives.
<LI>Pat Buchanan:  He has the balls to put his cards on the table. He is standup.
<LI>Harry Browne:  I've read his book, and he has very well defined plans for reducing taxes and clearing up the mess that government seems to be today.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only one who will return the Federal government to its Constitutionally granted powers and give us back our freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne for president!  People should have the right to choose how to live their own lives without government intrusion into their financial affairs.  The free market is good, efficient, and should not be tampered with except with extreme care (perhaps on the environment.)  Local governments give individuals political power in their communities.  Government regulation (socialism) will be the ruin of us all!
<LI>Harry Browne, because I want to see people's individual liberties and personal responsibilities restored to them.
<LI>Hary Browne
<LI>William Bennett - Best person that would have a chance at winning.
<LI>Harry Browne - Will seriously persue ways to reduce gov't
<LI>Harry Browne, because, if elected he would push for repeal of the IRS and the War on Drugs
<LI>William Bennett
<LI>Harry Browne/Less Government
<LI>Bob Dole - he has the integrity, experience and strong moral character we need 
<LI>Robert Dole, ANYONE is better than Bill Clinton
<LI>clinton best of worst choices
<LI>Harry Browne, to restore respect for the principle of a voluntary society.
<LI>Harry Browne because government as it exists today does not work!
<LI>pat buchanan
<LI>Clinton; he is better than Dole
<LI>Harry Browne - reduce government
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Harry Browne - Gov't has gone beyond Constitutional authority.  Libertarian policies restore legitimate power.
<LI>Harry Browne - He'll reduce the power and size of the federal government
<LI>Clinton....he is the only choice as the Republican Party has been taken over by the Christian Crazies.  We need a third party which would split off the fundies into their own sick little group and let the rest of the Republicans get on with insuring the rights of the individual...regardless of their personal philosophy.  
<LI>John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party has some good ideas on really "reinventing government", and deserves more attention.  Society should however do more independent of government, in which case this is a less important question.
<LI>Harry Brown: government doesn't work.
<LI>buchanan
<LI>Harry Brown, Clinton=murderer, Dole=Old crank
<LI>dole
<LI>Brown, to bring an end to prohibitory laws (Drug War).
<LI>Richard Lamm-Responsible Entitlemenmt Reform
<LI>Browne is for less government
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>bwowne-legalize drugs now
<LI>more discussion on lowering payroll taxes on middle class.
<LI>Clinton... he cares about education, health care, fairness
<LI>Pat Buchanan because he is unwavering.  I believe I know where he honestly stands.  He believes in America first and not the UN.  He believes in equal opportunity for those that will take it.  All are created equal with the right to become unequal!
<LI>Harry Browne, because he will stop the government from strangling the economy and violating our rights.
<LI>Harry Browne,  He believes the government does not work, He's right
<LI>Browne - because the eroding of civil liberties is my primary concern
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's prochoice in everything.
<LI>I am having a difficult time with the decision, I do not favor Dole or Clinton. I do however prefer someone who supports less government involvement, who is pro-choice.  Who will that be???  I will wait to see who runs a positive campaign not a negative one....
<LI>Harry Browne,  Make the federal gov smaller no fed income tax
<LI>Harry Browne- best ideas for the future/would implement most real change.
<LI>bill clinton   he is doing a good job and should have four more years.
<LI>Clinton, Dole is way too interested in the rich and big buisness. 
<LI>Harry Browne...   I just want to be free...
<LI>Harry Browne: Govt is causeing most of today's problems. He spells it all out in "Why Govt doesn't work".
<LI>harry browne, shake things up
<LI>Harry Browne.  We need the sweeping changes he proposes.
<LI>Bob Dole, The only viable alternative to someone who does not deserve to be president
<LI>Harry Browne, (Today's) Government Doesn't Work! Altruism IS evil.
<LI>Lower Taxes, Less Spending, Less Spending, Less Spending
<LI>Bill Clinton  The economy is good and he more nearly represents my views
<LI>Mary Col Hollis of the Socialist Party
<LI>Anyone but who's running
<LI>Harry Browne!!! Help get him into the debates and you'll see why.
<LI>Bill Clinton. He is more moderate.
<LI>Harry Browne -- less government!
<LI>Harry Browne because he represents a real change.  Differences between the Republican and Democratic candidates are merely cosmetic.  
<LI>Harry Browne- He's the only one that really wants smaller government.
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate who has not lied, cheated or stolen from me. He actually has read the U.S. Constitution and will actually abide by it rather than reinterpret it out of existence.
<LI>DOLE
<LI>Clinton--he's doing an outstanding job!
<LI>Harry Browne has the potential to bring about drastic changes in government - sometimes too drastic, but as long as we have a Democrat/Republican congress to keep a leash on him, he'll take our government where it needs to head.
<LI>Harry Browne - he stands on princples, not for political gain.
<LI>Harry Browne - because hes stands for what our founding fathers stood for - FREEDOM!!!!!
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne - primarily because of fiscal and taxation policy, and also because his party advocates a liberalization of our societies draconian drug laws.
<LI>The candidate who is most honestly working to better the country. The least selfish.
<LI>Harry Browne would act on his convictions
<LI>Someone who embodies the working man.  Worked in a factory, works 9 - 5 at 4.25 an hour.  He would do better the all the "professional" poltitions
<LI>I'd like to see Harry Browne.  Failing that, Richard Lamm.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne, he is the only candidate who has truly interested in reducing the size of government.
<LI>browne - his econ policies
<LI>harry browne because he speaks the truth about government and is firm in his commitment   commit
<LI>Harry Browne - He is the first candidate who knows and actually says that Government does not work.I believe him when he says that he would slash the Fed.Gov. to constitutional levels.
<LI>Harry Browne will fire the IRS and end the drug war idiocy!
<LI>Clinton---he cares for the middle class and for the poor---his experience in avoiding the draft in Vietnam is admirable
<LI>Ross Perot (because he has more of a chance than Harry browne)
<LI>Harry Browne - because government doesn't work!
<LI>Bob Dole (although the possibility is remote), because the notion of four more years of Billary nauseates me.
<LI>Harry Browne- I'm tired of Replicans & democrats
<LI>clinton, strong on gun control
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Brown, we need government to protect the environment, the elderly, and provide for a common defense.  Not to slowly take our rights away and in the process make itself even more powerful.
<LI>Harry Browne - Smaller Government, Lower Taxes, More Liberty
<LI>Harry Browne, because of his statement that he would sign all bills that decrease the size and scope of gov. and veto all that would increase it until it was 1/10 the size it is now.
<LI>Bill... to maintain a moderate supreme-court only...
<LI>Of the candidates still running, Harry Browne. Bob Dole and Bill Clinton BOTH represent BIG GOVERNMENT and will support more of what is destroying the U.S. today.
<LI>Harry Browne, to get Government off of our backs.
<LI>Anybody who will get rid of stupid welfare, why shouls SOME people get FREE money without working while every else works hard?
<LI>bob dole he has the experience to do the job and most importent dole tells the truth.....
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate committed to making government smallers and less intrusive
<LI>dole.  a republivan president will achieve more than a democratic one would with the current republican dominated congress.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he will reduce government intrusion
<LI>Harry Brown -- only one willing to protect freedom, and who would eliminate the national debt
<LI>Harry Browne, for his representation of a vast number of Americans who are tired of the criminally negligent and self-serving politicians responsible for the explosion of unneccesary legislation that gluts our society and has destroyed our freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne, both parties have failed miserably and he is the only reAL alternative
<LI>BILL CLINTON 
<LI>Harry Brown.  Refer to his campaigne statements and his book; Government does not work!
<LI>Clinton-- He is very good and he has demonstrated it, the country is in good shape and he has done what he said.
<LI>Clinton--Under his administration the Federal payroll has shrunk, unemployment is down, inflation is under control.  I firmly believe he cares more about the "little guy."  And, lastly, Bob Dole is too old!
<LI>Harry Browne, because Government doesn't work!
<LI>Harry Browne - He will reduce the size of the federal government
<LI>I want to see Bill Clinton re-elected, because he's getting things done, dispite personal attacts
<LI>Harry Browne, reduce the tax burden, balance the budget, make our country more prosperous
<LI>Harry Browne - libertarian principles
<LI>Alan Keyes. He is a man of principle and character. He knows what he believes and is able to articulate it clearly in a persuasive way.
<LI>Harry Browne: Federal Government is in serious violation of the US Constitution!
<LI>Pat Buchanan. He is a Conservative and is not controlled by the "establishment".
<LI>Pat Buchanan  He's the only candidate I have seen that has convictions that stay the same nomatter what poll comes out
<LI>Browne
<LI>Browne, smaller government is better government
<LI>Clinton.  Although he isn't perfect, he's tried to make things better.  ¡ like that.
<LI>Harry Browne because he will end the war on drugs
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who really wants to reduce the size of the federal government
<LI>Harry Browne because I feel that he would be a big help in taking the government back to its intended state.
<LI>HHarry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne - he understands that government's role is only to prevent the initiation of force and fraud and nothing else.
<LI>Richard Lamm, eventhough he is not in your survey, I believe that he is the best candidate for the presidency because he has governmental executive experience as governor of Colorado and has some new ideas that are feasible.
<LI>Harry Browne realizes that the US is not run constitutionally.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only one with consistent principles aimed at reducing government and giving back the much needed civil liberties to the people.  He is the *only* presidential candidate in history to qualify for and consequently *refuse* federal election matching funds!  He believes that people are individuals and such have the right to do as they see fit for themselves, without hurting others. Weather that be putting drugs into their body or jumping off the Empire State Building.  Freedom, tru
 freedom, of choice must be returned to the people.  <end soapbox>
<LI>Harry Browne-because a small government is cheaper than a bad one.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate who will really do something to reduce the size and intrusion of the federal government
<LI>Ralph Nader because he has great ideas and stands by his principles.
<LI>A principle center leader
<LI>harry browne-he is the most libertarian candidate 
<LI>President Clinton The economy is so much better now than four years ago and he is more for low and middle class people than the rich.
<LI>Since Buchanan & Forbes are out of the picture--I will vote for Harry Browne!
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate committed to upholding the Bill of Rights
<LI>Harry Browne - Less government, less government, less government!!! His uncompromising convictions!
<LI>Bob Dole because he possesses that quality from which all others are derived - character
<LI>Harry Browne, to return America to the Constitutional principles the country was founded on by Thomas Jefferson nearly 200 years ago.
<LI>Harry Browne; smaller gov't
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate who is committed to substantially reducing the size and power of the federal government.  He also plans immediately balance the federal budget as well as take a huge chunk out of the national debt.  I can't imagine anyone who I would rather see as predident, including Colin Powell and Ross Perot, as much as I would like Libertarian Harry Browne to be president.
<LI>Harry Browne. I want the IRS abolished.
<LI>pat buchanan because he is diggity dank
<LI>Harry Browne, I have children, I want them to live freely in a stable, peaceful world.
<LI>Bill Clinton would probably be my choice for president because he cares what happens to the people. He dosen't want to cut taxes so the government can do more for the people and I admire that. Besides, all the other candidates are too religiously involved or family values.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only cand. who recognizes that government doesn't work.
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne,he is for dismantling the big goverment money machine
<LI>Colin Powell
<LI>Harry Browne since he is the only candidate committed to the fundamental values outlined in the Constitution.
<LI>Bill Clinton...appointment of federal judges and a check on Republican excesses
<LI>I would like the Bob Dole as president, because Clinton can't stop lying.
<LI>Harry Browne because he konws that Government doesn't work
<LI>Honesty-Harry Browne
<LI>I'm not sure but I do not like the current choices.
<LI>Harry Browne.  
<LI>Harry Browne - Less Government Intrusion
<LI>Harry Browne, he stands for less gov't. and personal liberty.
<LI>Harry Browne. Can speak to the issues most Americans care to hear about in the presidential debates. He is running an honest campaign, 100% voluntary contributions.  He refused matching funds, the first candidate to qualify,but refuse.  Electing him president would have a significant positive impact on the lives of many Americans 
<LI>Harry Browne, because he would reduce government the most without playing favorites.
<LI>Dole because he's not a draft dodging, wonanizing, pot smoking draft dodger like his opponent.
<LI>Ross Perot, the defecit is the biggest problem we have
<LI>Harry Browne: He's the most logical choice to anyone with a brain.
<LI>Harry Browne, Because Government Doesn't Work And He Knows It!
<LI>Harry Browne, because he stands for personal and economic liberty. All the other candidates want to run your life -- the hallmark of authoritarians, whether left or right. Libertarians simply believe you should be free to live as you choose so long as you don't hurt others. I think this is morally and pragmatically correct. Browne believes in this, he has integrity, and he will try to win liberty for all. 
<LI>Harry Browne would dismantle the federal government and return power where it belongs, with the people themseleves.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate with a coherent policy to return the country to one the founding fathers would recognize.
<LI>Harry Brown Continue current path & experiance revolution
<LI>Harry Browne - less government!
<LI>Harry Browne.  To show people that they can live better lives with a smaller, less abusave goverment.
<LI>Ralph Nader, to challenge the corporate control of government.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is running on the principals that our country was founded on.
<LI>Harry Brown-End the War on Drugs!!Stop the black market w/ provides incentives that corrupts governments,police & criminalizes everyday people.
<LI>Harry Browne - He is the only candidate who has any philosophic consistency.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne - I'm tired of the Constitution being ignored.
<LI>Bill Clinton. He seems human and in touch with the people
<LI>A libertarian, because the government is our biggest enemy
<LI>harry browne to make the govm't viable in the 21st century
<LI>Harry Browne, read the Constitution.
<LI>Clinton-- he's one of our greatest presidents!
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne - he will help to restore our constitution
<LI>Pat Buchanan, Pro Life and puts America first
<LI>Lamar Alexander ! He's pro-gun and he is pro states rights !
<LI>Harry Browne to restore Constitutional governmnet
<LI>Harry Browne...because I believe he will bring about much needed changes in America.  Not so much a return to American values and ideals but a beginning of the expression of the true idea of American values.
<LI>Harry Browne- End the War on Drugs, let business do business, no legislation of morality by the government.
<LI>STEVE FORBES WE NEED SOMEONE WITH BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
<LI>Harry Browne - the only candidate really wanting less government
<LI>There is a definite need for Libertarian viewpoints in U.S. Government offices.
<LI>David Duke because he will help the White Race survive
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate who will actually reduce the size of government, drastically cut taxes, and revive American liberty.
<LI>Harry Browne. We need less government and more individual responsibility.
<LI>Harry Browne  We need less government - less taxes!
<LI>Colin Powell- leadership 
<LI>Charlton Heston, he seems to be the only canidate that knows the 2nd amendment is in the bill or rights.
<LI>Harry Browne because he's the best person for the job!!!
<LI>Harry Browne:  He's the only viable candidate
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Anyone who will help dismantle a large segment of the US gov't without preference for lobbyists' concerns
<LI>Harry Browne Because he believes Gov't is the Problem not the solution.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The dems & reps can't get it done.
<LI>Bob Dole, because Bill Clinton is a liar and if we had a president who would work with Congress, then they could make some changes and get some things done.
<LI>Harry Browne because the current status of government doesn't work!
<LI>Jack Kemp because he is agood leader and has great ideas about the economy
<LI>Harry Browne, because he would try to reduce the size of the Federal Government.
<LI>Elizabeth Hanford Dole - Bob for First Gentleman! There's still time, let's change the dynamics a bit at the 1996 convention! I'm sure the party would support it - Bob Dole just needs to say he is out of energy or something, and he needs someone better to carry on the campaign, someone who still has the energy to lead America in the next four years - Dole (Elizabeth) for President in 1996; If not, then in 2000.
<LI>Bob Dole  His campaign doesn't have a body count
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne.  Prosecute Criminal Elements against the Constitution!
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne.  While I am not 100% libertarian, it is obvious to me that our government has gotten far too involved in far too many areas of our lives.  The intent of the constitution was to prevent a large, uncontrollable government from ruling absolutely.  What we currently have is part democracy, part fraud.  The states should have authority in all things not spoken of in the original constitution;  and the people if not the state.  In other words, it has gotten to the point where we serve the gover
ment, instead of the government serving us, and that must end.
<LI>Harry Browne 'cause noone else will save America
<LI>Nadar.  I disagree with him on a lot of things, but I don't think he would try to appease me and people who disagree with me.  I just want him to do what he thinks is right.  When it is all boiled down, Most americans agree on fundamentals, like education and freedom.  The nitpicky, though often necessary, should be put by the wayside for a while, and someone like Nadar could then organize.  Clean the cobwebs, if you will.  You can only patch a boat so long before you should buy a new one.  Hopefully t
e new one will look like the old one mostly
<LI>Harry Browne....Less government. Period.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the only candidate that faces the Issue that Government Doesn't Work!
<LI>Government programs have things worse, not better
<LI>Harry Browne - He will help limit the powers of government to those clearly defined in the constitution and Bill of Rights.
<LI>Harry Browne. He makes the most sense.
<LI>Browne,  So I may raise my family and run my business and life the way I want to.  Not by the assinine standards of the Gov or the current fadish mores of the media.  Thank you
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Dole he is a better leader. And he gets things done.
<LI>harry browne will end income tax, reduce crime, abolish ATF, FBI, and other federal thugs
<LI>Harry Browne because I support his campaign statements and an end to the War on Drugs.
<LI>Harry Browne, best chance of a 3rd party candidate to win and interesting ideas
<LI>anyone who is concerned with the good of the country
<LI>Harry Browne.  He understands that government doesn't work.  Everything it touches it screws up in a very expensive way.  For-profits and non-profits can handle all of our needs if only we could keep our own money to donate and spend it as we see fit.  Government regulations benefit the politically well-connected at the expense of consumers and smaller competitors.  Republicans betray free markets and Democrats betray individual liberty.  
<LI>Harry Browne.  He makes his decisions based on the principles on which this country was founded.  He has a legitimate workable answer to all questions raised about the operation of this government, nationally and internationally, which also protects the freedoms that are secured by the U.S. Constitution.
<LI>Harry Browne, He is the candidate most in favor of liberty
<LI>Harry Browne - Less Government
<LI>Harry Browne for the biggest change in U.S. Government history
<LI>Of the 3 candidates, Dole.  No surprise huh?
<LI>While I'm not a Clinton apologist by any means - he's rubbed me the wrong way more than once - I prefer him to almost any candidate that could get the Republican nomination. The Republican Party has been taken over by rightwing religious zealots who want to impose their beliefs on everyone and rich or wannabe rich people who care about little besides creating more wealth for themselves. The Democratic Party has itsown problems, but at least they haven't adopted a party platform based on control and gre
d. 
<LI>Harry Browne-  He's the only one I trust :)
<LI>Harry Browne - because government doesn't work.
<LI>harry browne  libertarian ideals
<LI>Harry Browne should be the nest President because he is the only candidate willing to drastically reduse the size of our government and revert to Constitutional and Bill of Rights morals.
<LI>Harry Browne - Reduce the government NOW.
<LI>Browne-gov't reduction; elimination of IRS; etc.
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>Dole - Anybody But Clintoon
<LI>Jack Kemp
<LI>1.  Harry Brown  2.  Most accurately reflects my philosophy
<LI>Ralph Nader, we need an independent left politics in the US
<LI>Harry Browne, he says what he means, not what he thinks people want to hear. He knows what it's like to work for a living, and the fact that government doesn't work 
<LI>Harry Browne.  I believe it is time to move away from large govenment control and into personal responsibility.
<LI>Bill Clinton... He is the best man for the office.  He has youth.
<LI>Ralph Nader.  He is the only candidate not owned by MNC's!
<LI>Harry Browne - we need to eliminate 90% of the federal govt.
<LI>Harry Browne - We need someone to attempt to stop the republicrats.
<LI>Harry Browne, he seems to stick to his convictions and he has a genuine plan to eliminate the national debt.
<LI>Harry Browne to end the income tax and stop the war on drugs!
<LI>dole seems to be a pawn of the tobacco industry
<LI>Harry Browne-Ihave read his issues and believe that he is the best person to lead this country
<LI>Harry Browne - all other candidates promise "more of the same" which clearly has not worked!
<LI>Ralph Nader -- most honest, caring, compassionate, unwavering candidate available
<LI>Harry Browne - Less government, more personal responsibility
<LI>Harry Browne;  He wants to return the federal government to constitutional levels.
<LI>Harry Browne because Government doesn't work
<LI>Harry Browne  Because I read his book.
<LI>harry browne. Because he wants goverment out of peoples lives.
<LI>Harry Browne, he'll get govt off my back and out of my wallet.
<LI>Harry Browne because he would slash government.
<LI>harry brown to abo;ish irs!!!!!!
<LI>Harry Browne because he neither sells out to the "haves" nor patronizes the "have nots."
<LI>clinton because he is fair and open minded, a man of all the people
<LI>clinton
<LI>Harry Browne - To dramatically reduce size of government
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate that really wants to reduce the size of the government.
<LI>Dole More positive media, less scandal, security minded more than freedom minded voters
<LI>Bob Dole   , You can't trust clinton to tell the truth
<LI>Dick Lamm because he understands the need to reduce both legal and illegal immigration.
<LI>Bill Clinton. Although I think little of the President, I believe Republicans are too indebted to the so-called "religious right"(their focus is on a Christian world, and I am not a "christian"), the wealthy and corporate America. Republican Congress members, particularly those most recently elected but also people like Thurmond, Helms, Dornan, et al, stand for the worst elements of America. Bob Dole is not the answer.Even if I thought he was a better candidate than the President, I would not vote for 
im because his party is too dangerous.
<LI>Bob Dole, To continue reducing goverment, Eliminating Abortion
<LI>Browne...we need real change..go back to constitution
<LI>Pat Schroder. One Bitch'n Babe. Is a go to gal and can cry to get things done!
<LI>Harry Browne, he's the only one I can support!
<LI>Harry Browne.  The Libertarian nominee is the only presidential candidate with a bold plan to roll back the Federal government AND the apparent will and convictions to finally take the fight to the two-winged "Federal Party" in Washington, D.C.
<LI>Clinton - If he doesn't win, Dole will, and with a Repub. Congress, that'd be real nasty.
<LI>Harry Browne, to restore our freedom.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Harry Browne because he has an actual plan to rid our lives of the government
<LI>Harry Browne (the candidate most likely to reduce the size/power of the federal government)
<LI>harry brown, because he is rational in his thoughts and actions and books, and he has a wider integrated perspective of the world.  plus he will set free businesses to produce for freedoms for individuals, so that they can take back control for there lives to be more productive.
<LI>Browne, libertarian idealogy, personal freedom=personal responsibility
<LI>Ross Perrot
<LI>Pat Buchanan on the U.S. Taxpayers Party ticket!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only major candidate who would shrink government.
<LI>Bob Dole - Anyone is better than Clinton
<LI>Harry Browne: He represents a return to the Constitution
<LI>I am torn on this issue.  I grew up republican, but Dole says nothing that has any value, he avoids controversial issues and has latch onto a tired and unsuccessful economic plank.  Clinton on the other hand, has turned out to be an excellent leader, but his alleged weakness of character and initial liberal tendancies make me a bit nervous about voting for him.
<LI>Harry Browne!  We need less government, not more!
<LI>Clinton.  He is closer to the people's viewpoint.
<LI>Clinton - I fear the alternative
<LI>Harry Browne - Quit spending so much of my damn money irresponsibly and get the feds the hell out of my life.
<LI>Pat buchanan because he says what he means and means what he says!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only one saying we need to cut government a lot -- and means it!
<LI>Browne,less goverment
<LI>Harry Browne (the candidate most likely to reduce the size/power of government)
<LI>Harry Browne, I believe that government exists solely to protect man's rights.
<LI>bob dole

<LI>browne-because Dole & Clinton are not trustworthy
<LI>Clinton-Of all the non-Republicans,he can be elected.  A Republican congress AND Republican president would be the WORST.
<LI>Harry Browne, because government doesn't work
<LI>Clinton-He's for the common person,not the rich
<LI>Harry Browne, he will give people their lives and freedom back where they belong; in their own hands.
<LI>Harry Browne. I'm sick of waffling policiticians like.....
<LI>clinton needs another shot at it
<LI>Clinton - the alternative is unacceptable

<LI>someone libertarian, we need a stronger third party
<LI>Harry Browne, less government
<LI>Harry Browne.  Get the government off my back.
<LI>Truthfully I do not like Dole or Clinton for president; I am mad because the republicans did not keep all thieir promises.  I would vote for Ralph Nader if I really thought he could win.  The country has become an oligarchy run by captains of industry who infuse more  money into lobbying congress than it takes to run the damm thing
<LI>Bob Dole--let's get serious about this nation and where we're headed as we approach the next millenium

<LI>Harry Browne; REAL reduction in government

<LI>Harry Browne, He wants less government and so do I!

<LI>Harry Browne for freedom, self-determination, justice
<LI>Harry Browne, he presents the only alternative to politict as usual

<LI>Harry Browne, Libertarian philosophy of government
<LI>Bob Dole -- Four more years of Clinton, his lying, and liberalism will destroy America.
<LI>Harry Browne will get us back on the Constitutional track.
<LI>Harry Browne. We have gargantuan problems in our society and the two major parties are not willing to use reason in coming up with new approaches to solve them. A third party candidate will not be fettered by political expedients and will not be afraid of not getting elected next term (in part because he will probably support term limits). All these reasons and hundreds more lead me to my conclusion to support Browne.
<LI>CLINTON. HE'S NOT PERFECT, BUT HE'S THE LEAST DANGEROUS.

<LI>Harry Browne is the only credible pro-liberty candidate.
<LI>Harry Browne would be great if he can get elected.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Great man, great leader, great record.  And, look at the other choices, Clinton and Perot.  Scary.

<LI>Harry Browne; he has the most honesty and integrity of them all
<LI>Harry Browne - the only candidate who believes in freedom and understands the intended role of the federal government.
<LI>a president with high moral standards, the decline of this nation is due to a lack of morality by leaders, parents and others in authority
<LI>Some who has morals & values (not necessarily Christian - this is where your poll is biased - ) Because I cannot honor and believe in someone who is not. I woould not go to a physician who smokes, drinks & is overweight -- why should I trust my future to someone who lies?
<LI>Harry Browne: He's the only candidate on the ticket who stands for real change--a change back to the form of government envisions by our founding fathers.
<LI>Harry Browne, for his support of individual freedoms
<LI>Harry Browne.  Huge tax cuts and spending cuts now
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne because he knows that government should be used as a last resort for any problem
<LI>Harry Browne: He's the only candidate on the ticket who stands for real change--a change back to the form of government envisions by our founding fathers.

<LI>Based on the current candidates, I would like to see Dole elected because his views more closely line up with mine than Clinton's.
<LI>Dole because he'll make America a better place to live in

<LI>Pat Buchanan- I trust him. He has integrity. He knows what's wrong and needs to be fixed.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who knows the constitution of the US.  The federal government was never intended to do more than military protection and judicial-contract law.  Government cannot dictate morals or help the "poor".  Federal income tax is unconstitutional.  
<LI>Harry Browne, because GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK!
<LI>harry browne; for goverment reform 
<LI>Browne -- he's a change, and represents ideas that many americans would agree with, if they were aware of those ideas.

<LI>Rush Limbaugh because he is the only one that had good views
<LI>We need a president with integrity and one that the people know where he stands on issues.

<LI>Harry Browne Looks at real issues not the blame game
<LI>Ralph Nader.  Because he suports the best most egalitarian economic structures and social programs.

It is ridiculous that the creaters of this poll list the Green Party as a party affiliation, but do not list the Green party candidate as a choice amongt a lot of less viable and less well known candidates. Ralph Nader is the only candidate that supports a platform that can maximize freedom for everyone throu
h maximizing equality.

<LI>Harry Browne--knows what makes for a moral government and knows how to begin the move toward that moral government.
<LI>Jack Kemp or Bill Bradley: honorable men, neither of whom is running. We need campaign finance reform!!!!!!!!
<LI>Pres. Clinton is my choice.  He is a good, kind, humane person who, while making mistakes and straddling on the fence, best represents my own views.  He is a decent man and wants to do what's right.  His wife is intelligent and an asset to this country.  He is not perfect, nor is his wife, but given the choices we have, Bill Clinton is the best President we have had since JFK.  The only person who would have been a great president, had he been given the opportunity, was Hubert Humphrey.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he matches more closely, but not completely, what I believe in
<LI>BOB DOLE BECAUSE CLINTON IS HORRIBLELFG
<LI>Clinton, because the public is stupid.
<LI>Browne, becuase neither Clinton nor Dole are acceptable
<LI>Ralph Nader

<LI>Get rid of Federal Government intrusion, and spending.  Give rights bacck to the states.
<LI>Harry Browne.He wants to end the "Insane Drug War"
<LI>In a race between Dole & Clinton, Dole, since Clinton has completely failed to make any of the changes he set out to, and due to his lackof ability to hold to a stand on any issue.
<LI>RALPH NADER-he is honest & ethical and has proven it for 30 years.  He is the only candidate we can trust and who has the intelligence, the attorney and Capitol Hill background to be "savvy" enough to handle the shysters and specail interest leaches...and all others who have sold out to greed and power.  He is  alert to the huge and ever growing threat to us all from the corporations.
<LI>Harry Browne, Agree with all Libertarian Party Policies and with what Harry Browne would implement in particular.
<LI>Anyone who is not affiliated with either the Democrats or Republicans
<LI>Bob Dole.  Bill Clinton is too far to the left.
<LI>Harry Browne. His views are closest to my own.
<LI>Harry Browne since he is a Libertarian
<LI>Ronald Reagan-  Why not the best!
<LI>Ross Perot     We need someone who will balance the buget and be a strong negotiator
<LI>It doesn't matter

<LI>Bob Dole.  Honesty and Leadership abilities are far superior.
<LI>clinton - he may suffer from the same corrupt tendencies as others in positions of political power BUT at least he has values and wants to accomplisg something besides lining his own pocket and wielding his own influence over others.
<LI>Hillary Clinton
<LI>Forbes or Powell, need decisive individual as president
<LI>Harry Browne; the only candidate who truly believes in returning liberty to the people.
<LI>Harry Browne!
<LI>Buchanan - Return control of the country to it's citizens

<LI>Bob Dole, because he is the only one who can beat Clinton now
<LI>Harry Browne - Only one left who respects our Constitution.
<LI>We need a president who be unwaivering in his/her representation of the US.  Someone who will stand their ground w/out compromising the integrity of the White House.  Bob Dole has the ability, over Clinton, to do this.

<LI>Bob Dole, because he is more trustworthy
<LI>harry browne.  the us gov. cannot and cannot be expected to provide for the needs of the people.  the people provide there own needs.  we need the government out of our lives, as much as possible, in order to do so.  therefore the washington beaurocracy needs to be dismantled and Browne is the only candidate who is likely to do that.

<LI>HARRY BROWNE-HE'S ENTITLED TO MATCHING FUNDS-BUT HE WON'T TAKE THEM.  NO WELFARE FOR POLITICIANS. THE ONLY HONEST MAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
<LI>Harry Browne.  His ideals match my political beliefs almost exactly.  He would pull the US military out of other countries, and drastically reduce the national debt and tax burdens.  He also believes in eliminating victimless crimes.
<LI>The best canditate.  Preferably one who has no preordained political agenda.
<LI>Bill Clinton has been a good president and deserves a second term.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Bill Clinton-- after rocky start w/ appointments+health care, I feel he's done a pretty good job.  Economy is a +, Somalia+, Bosnia+, N. Ireland+, Middle East+, Family Leave Act+, NAFTA+... if, however, he has deep involvement in filegate (the only 'scandal' with any substance), he should step down.
<LI>Ralph Reed   He's the man!
<LI>Bill Clinton-- after rocky start w/ appointments+health care, I feel he's done a pretty good job.  Economy is a +, Somalia+, Bosnia+, N. Ireland+, Middle East+, Family Leave Act+, NAFTA+...
<LI>Bob Dole - This country needs to get back to real leadership.
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>Richard Lamm--He's not Clinton or Dole and is well qualified.  Let's shake up the entrenched political system.
<LI>Dwight David Eisenhower....8 years of low taxes, amazing prosperity, world peace, a REAL leader
<LI>Clinton knows about the FBI files!  A 'snafu'? Yeah right!
<LI>Bob Dole - he will bring back some dignity and honesty to the White House and the country.
<LI>Bob Dole, because Buchanan wont get the nomination and he isnt Clinton.. 
<LI>Ralph Nader because he's for the average person
<LI>Harry Browne because he would actually try to reduce the size and role of governmentby both eliminating programs and taxes AT THE SAME TIME
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the only candidate that understands that Government Doesn't Work!  He won't try to fix it.  He'll try to shrink it!
<LI>Harry Browne because I agree with every single point on his platform
<LI>Browne. The government IS the problem.
<LI>Harry Browne - Only candidate who will reduce government
<LI>HARRY BROWNE-ONLY BROWNE HAS THE GUTS & UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY THE FAILED PROHIBITION OF DRUGS IS DESTROYING OUR SOCIETY & OUR LIBERTIES!!!!!!!
<LI>Bob Dole, because he is the best man for the job.
<LI>I would like to see Ralph Nader for President.  For over twenty years he has been a stauch consumer advocate who speaks for people, not politics.
<LI>Ralph Nader because he is a Green!
<LI>HARRY BROWNE
<LI>Pat Buchannan, only real pro-life candidate
<LI>Bob Dole because he has Military Experience and is has Morals and a wife who would make a very gracious First Lady 
<LI>Colin Powell because the two main candidates - Clinton and Dole - are mired down in a campaign that is an insult to voters.  I believe Powell is well qualified and would adhere to policies, issues, planning for America instead of feeling "entitled" by his party to win at any cost 
<LI>Bill Clinton - We need someone who will at least to some degree, stand-up for the middle to lower classes, and will not allow religious nuts legislate how we live, and also, to keep corporations from destroying the Earth.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The Rebublicans and Democrats are merely two different heads on the same statist body.  We need less government, less taxes, and more individual freedom.  We also need a government free from the influence of those who would have us live according to their particular religious tenets.  A Libertarian government is the only way to achieve this.  
<LI>Rick Thompkins, The Right To Arms issue defines the candidate who trusts the people.
<LI>Steve Forbes on most issues (taxes, abortion, business), Pat Buchannan on emotional energy and nationalism.  The bottom line: we conservatives haven't a slick willy this time around!
<LI>Bob Dole- He's moderate, as are, in my opinion, most Americans. I belive he would be a president for all Americans.
<LI>Harry Browne. He will severely curtail the whole government bureaucracy, get the government out of our private lives, and promote the Libertarian ideas.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  Record of achievements speaks for itself.  Don't believe GOP election-year sleezemongering.
<LI>Bill Clinton, Because I feel he is more genuinally interested in improving conditions for all Americans not just the wealthy and privlaged, I also fear the social conservatism prevalent within the Republican party.
<LI>Bob Dole, lesser of 2 evils, the most likely to win on the republican ticket.  Clinton's whitehouse has had to many problems due to lack of experience, lack of deciseveness, lack of moral leadership and standards.
<LI>Dole   He has the experience and the ability to lead
<LI>N. Gingrich. 
<LI>Rush Limbaugh because we need someone with a set of goals and priorities that can be identified and counted on, someone who has beliefs and principles.
<LI>Bob Dole - He has the experience, integrity, and values this country needs - and he is not a dishonest, sleazy, liar lik Bill Clinton!
<LI>Dole, because I cannot trust Clinton with the future of this country!
<LI>Dole.  Leadership..someone who will work with congress.
<LI>Bob Dole because we need a leader with conservative values, experience in Government, and one with CHARACTER!!!
<LI>Harry Browne who will REALLY reduce the size and intrusion of government.
<LI>Bill Clinton, because I believe that he is more pragmatic than Dole.  
<LI>Ronald Reagan - reasons: 1983-1987, in the USA.
<LI>Ralph Nader, because he has a proven record of advocating for "we, the people". 
<LI>Ralph Nader/eliminate pac's, campaign reform, take care of the planet, reform healthcare...dems & reps won't do it, they serve each other & follow party bosses like sheep.
<LI>Bob Dole because the Clintons are a joke !
<LI>rush limbagh
<LI>Bob Dole because of his positions on lovcal vs national govt, balamced budget and I have no trust that I can believe anything Clinton says!!!
<LI>Bob Dole; honest,, cares more about the country than himself 
<LI>Pat Buchanan, because I am Pro-Life and believe in America First!
<LI>IMPEACH CLINTON IN '96!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Harry Browne -- the ONLY one who truly will REDUCE govt
<LI>Dole, Clinton is a Socialist
<LI>The country must have a man with integrity; Bob Dole has it; Clinton, a con-man and a liar, does not.  I will vote for Dole in 1996.
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he is pro-choice and I understand his stand in the issues.
<LI>president clinton   he works hard
<LI>Pat Buchanan.  I believe he
<LI>Ralph Nader, because he's the only candidate with any integrity.
<LI>Ralph Nader. Bill Bradley if he were running.
<LI>Ralph Nader - would help return the power to the people rathar than corporate America
<LI>Harry Browne -  He would significantly downsize the federal  government.
<LI>Bill Clinton- The lesser evil (by far)
<LI>Bob Dole because the current president is an embarrasment to our country with all his lies and cover ups.
<LI>Bill Clinton's victory. Bob Dole is out of touch
<LI>Buchanan-for moral,eonomic,social and national security reasons
<LI>Clinton -- he won't screw up too badly.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE, HE WILL SHAKE THINGS UP AND GET THE COUNTRY MOVING IN SOCIAL EVOULOTION AS WELL AS JUDITIAL ,REFORM.
<LI>Bob Dole, because he has character. And, with a Republican held congress, he can get out the conservative ideas, without interference and lies put out by liberal democrats, so that people can actually see what the Republicans stand for, AMERICA!!!!!!! Less government, balanced budget, and more individual responsibility. Bob Dole is an all-around good man, and will make an excellent president in '96. President Bob Dole!!!!
<LI>Harry Browne to reduce size & intrusion of government
<LI>Harry Browne.  He would restore the government to the role outlined in the Constitution.
<LI>I believe Bill Bradley would make an excellent president.  He is intelligent and respected by the US People.  He could be the only choice able to unify the two parties. President Clinton and his wife, guilty or not , right or wrong have made Washington ineffective and more like a children's SHOUTING MATCH.                                                                             !!!
<LI>Harry Browne because government coersion is still coersion and should never infringe upon anyone who is not harming others.
<LI>*Whom* I want is just about any libertarian or or libertarian-Republican, rather than a collectivist (Democrat, Socialist, etc.)
<LI>Bill Clinton  He is our hope for the moderate view in the national government.
<LI>Harry Browne -- More Freedom Less Taxes
<LI>Steve Forbes
<LI>dole, because clinton reminds me of a used car salesman
<LI>dole, because clinton reminds me of a used car salesman
<LI>I would like to see an individual who will come out and say: "Look people, this country is 4trillion in debt, education sucks and we need to fix it.  Someone has to suck it up and make it better for those who follow after."  
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate calling for the end to the "war on durgs" and assett fofeiture.
<LI>Bob Dole- Conservative
<LI>Bob Dole - He has dignity and experience in government.
<LI>harry browne because government is out of control!
<LI>B.Clinton...He has put the economy back on the rite track 
<LI>Bob Dole.  I think he would return some class to the white house that the Clintons have destroyed.
<LI>David Duke, because he will stop the destruction of the White Race
<LI>Harry Browne.  I trust neither Clinton nor Dole to say what they mean and do what they say--they're too busy trying to appeal to everyone to do what's best for the nation as a whole.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the only one who truely respects the bill of rights.
<LI>browne  less government intrusion,  no IRS!!!
<LI>Buchanan. He puts America, it's workers, it's military ahead of foreign interests. He seems more honest and forthright than most other candidates. I would expect him to DO as he SAYS, not say one thing and do another.
<LI>Drugs Legalized
<LI>Bob Dole I feel he displays more of the qualities I find essintial in a president
<LI>Harry Browne, because he represents a philosophy desperately needed by this country.
<LI>Charles Collins. The only candidate who respects the Constitution,will repeal the Federal reserve act and get us out of the UN.
<LI>Dan Quayle. Who is a strong leader with good moral sense.
<LI>Bob Dole because he has the honesty and character that I would like to see in my President.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he is the lesser of all evils
<LI>clinton
<LI>Harry Browne or Ralph Nader, because the two-party system is pathalogic
<LI>Dole-he's honest and sincere.  He might do what he says he'll do.
<LI>Harry Browne:  We MUST take the power back from the elitist oligarchy inside the Beltway and return it to individual Americans.
<LI>bob dole - best available choice
<LI>Right now, the best choice is Dole.  However, you left the most important issue to me out of question 13.  I want someone who is HONEST.  That is the most important quality that I would look for in a President.
<LI>A third party canidate winning would break the monoply and corruption from both the Democrates and Republicans.  New visions are need to lead the country at its most troubled times.  We don't need poll watching leadership (Clinton and Dole).
<LI>dole
<LI>Clinton. He's done a very good job so far
<LI>Harry Browne - That government governs best which governs least
<LI>Jack Kemp because he supports a flat tax and he is a social conservative. 
<LI>Harry Browne. Why? Read his book!
<LI>Harry Browne, because the demopublicans are pro big govt, no matter what they claim
<LI>Bob Dole, because you can trust him.
<LI>Harry Browne.  I want government out of my life.
<LI>I believe that the Republican and Democratic parties have exercised an oligopoly over political thinking for too long.  If this country is to be saved, it will be by neither of these parties, but be a third.  I like Browne, I like his ideas, he has no chance, I'll vote for him anyway.
<LI>Bob Dole - he's the best of the two....
<LI>Harry Browne, B/C He seems to be the candidate with views closest to mine.
<LI>Harry Browne or Rick Tompkins.  I want a Libertarian.
<LI>Richard Lamm
<LI>A non-politition
<LI>Harry Brown - The problem is the System. Need Minimal System.
<LI>Harry Browne. We need to get the federal government out of our businesses and out of our bedrooms
<LI>Bill Clinton been in office to long to give up now.
<LI>Browne, only one with a plan to drastically reduce the size of the federal government
<LI>Someone I feel I can trust who has demonstrated his/her dedication to the future of this country.
<LI>Bob Dole , he is trustworthy, experienced, and good for us.
<LI>Clinton. He has his eye on the future more than almost any other politician I have seen. His personal life is his own business, if Hillary is satisfied, that is all that matters. His strengths are also his weaknesses. His ability to weigh options and seek compromise is good. He can be forceful and strong when necessary. The hardest folks for him to be strong with are his own constituency who are often too reluctant to compromise.
<LI>Bob Dole! He's fair and would provide much a needed values injection into the White House.
<LI>Harry Brownwe, because he stands for radically less government intrusion in the economic and personal lives of the citizens of this country.
<LI>Clinton, Because the Republician party is against black and other minorities
<LI>bob dole-honest, experienced-decent human being
<LI>Clinton,   he has kept many of his promises despite what you hear from Newt and his friends
<LI>Bill Clinton. 1- We know how he reacts. 2- No preferable choice.
<LI>the best--and we do not have the best choices
<LI>Harry Browne 
<LI>uh, i guess clinton is the more, aah, how to put this, YOUTHFUL of the two, but really, both suk.
<LI>Bob Dole  He has basic moral character and understands that ultimately God decides what is right and what is wrong.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Constitution, taxation, end this stupid war on drugs.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he believes in reducing Government. Government doesn't work.
<LI>ALAN kEYES  moral and honest
<LI>Lowell Weicker, former gov. of my home state and a tough, no nonsense leader with broad political experience and a moderate outlook
<LI>Forbes/Engler vs Powell/Kemp real candidates, real issues! real choices!!! NO BOZOs!!
<LI>Bob Dole - Honesty, integrity, experience, would support republican agenda
<LI>Pat Buchanan-- two words -- CHRISTIAN COALITION
<LI>Harry Browne, to return gov't back to minimal intrusion upon its citizens.
<LI>Harold Brown because he could stop Democratic efforts to rule your finances and Republican bills that would rule your private lives.
<LI>Ross Perot, because our country is not so much a government as it is a big business, and Ross Perot understands business, as opposed to economic theory; he understands what is ruining this country, and his approach is absolutely on track - I came to these conclusions BEFORE I ever heard of Ross Perot.
<LI>Clinton - Clinton has the interest of the people at heart.  Dole is a professional politician with too many strings attached.
<LI>Ted Gunderson, former head of FBI in LA he is knowledgeable about many skeletons that show how corrupt the system has become.
<LI>Harry Browne because he will uncompromising in support of freedom, liberty, and smaller government.
<LI>any republican- the further to the right the better. Dole is the only choice right now.
