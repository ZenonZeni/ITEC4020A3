<H2><HEAD>Chlorine-36 Found in Yucca Mountain Suggests Possible Fast Routes from Surface to
Repository Depths</HEAD></H2>
<HR>

<BODY>
Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have detected elevated levels of chlorine-36
in rock samples collected from several locations within the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF)
tunnel. This tunnel has been excavated to afford geologists with direct access to those parts of
Yucca Mountain that might be able to contain a repository.<P>
<P>
The elevated levels of chlorine-36, which scientists believe originated from atmospheric nuclear
tests conducted about 4 decades ago, were found at 5 locations, and at depths of up to 185 meters
(600 feet) from the surface of Yucca Mountain, along the first 3.4 kilometers (2.11 miles) of the
tunnel. Scientists knew from the outset that such findings were a possibility. Indeed, site models
dating back to 1983-1985 anticipated fast pathways through the mountain. The existence of such
paths did not in itself constitute an adverse condition. <P>
<P>
Scientists think that the chlorine-36 traveled from the surface along one or several fast pathways,
most probably through fractures and faults. It is still too early, though, to determine whether the
presence of elevated levels of chlorine-36 inside the ESF has any direct bearing on the
mountain's suitability as a repository site. At the least, however, the isotope should provide a
valuable method for identifying potential fast routes for surface water to get underground. <P>
<P>
No conclusions have yet been reached on the significance of the detection of chlorine-36 within
the facility. Further tests must be completed for scientists to better understand the hydrologic
processes at work in Yucca Mountain. 

<H3>Chlorine-36 Serves As a Valuable Tracer</H3>

Chlorine-36 is a cosmogenic isotope. An isotope is one of several different atoms of a particular
element having the same nuclear charge but different nuclear mass. The term "cosmogenic"
refers to the isotope's origin through the natural interaction of existing materials with high-energy
particles in cosmic rays shooting through the atmosphere. <P>

With a half-life of 301,000 years, chlorine-36 is one of several cosmogenic isotopes (such as
tritium and carbon-14) that serve as valuable tracers of geologic, hydrologic, atmospheric, and
oceanographic processes. For example, one can theoretically use isotopes to estimate the length
of time that a segment of water has been in the ground. This is done by comparing the amount of
an isotope dissolved in the water to the amount found in the soil at the surface.<P>
<P>
Cosmogenic isotopes like chlorine-36 also were created through the interaction of nuclear
explosions with materials found on the Earth and in the atmosphere. Most of these isotopes came
from the above-ground testing of nuclear weapons, primarily in the Pacific Ocean, from 1952 to
1958. Scientists generally assume, therefore, that most occurrences of chlorine-36 elevated above
natural levels are recent, that is, within the last half-century, probably during the nuclear tests of
the 1950s. Yet they must perform further tests that would establish this with certainty.<P>
<P>
Toward that end, they continue to look for evidence of other isotopes from nuclear testing, such
as tritium, technetium-99, or iodine-129, in areas where chlorine-36 was found. Because some
isotopes exhibit chemical behavior similar to that of chlorine-36, those isotopes will have moved
down through the same pathways at much the same rate, and in the same way.<P>
<P>
Though unlikely, there may, in fact, be another potential source for the elevated chlorine-36
samples found within the ESF. Elevated levels of the isotope may be attributable to cosmogenic
reactions within the rock involving calcite. Calcite, or calcium carbonate, is an abundant mineral
found at the Earth's surface, and especially in the arid soil at Yucca Mountain and other parts of
the Southwest. Recent research has indicated that cosmic rays can interact with calcite and other
calcium-bearing minerals, causing levels of chlorine-36 similar to those created by nuclear
detonations. Scientists at Yucca Mountain are therefore exploring whether enough chlorine-36
can be mobilized at the surface to produce the elevated ratios found underground. Preliminary
calculations indicate this is possible, though not likely. <P>
<P>
As site characterization continues, and the tunnel boring machine advances, additional water and
rock samples will be collected and analyzed for further occurrences of chlorine-36. These tests
will be performed within the context of the detailed, integrated hydrologic sampling, testing, and
modeling program already under way at Yucca Mountain. 

<H3>How Could Elevated Chlorine-36 Levels Appear at Repository Depths?</H3>

Yucca Mountain consists of a faulted eastward-tilted block of layered volcanic rock. Each layer,
or unit, responds differently to water. Above the water table, these rock units are unsaturated,
meaning that the pore spaces in the rock are occupied by both air and water. In unsaturated rock,
scientists normally expect water to move downward very slowly    perhaps a fraction of a
millimeter a year. However, in response to large amounts of precipitation, it is possible for water
to move much more rapidly through fractures and faults.<P>


<img  Alt="[Diagram:  A cross-section of Yucca Mountain showing how  water appears to have moved from the surface through the various rock layers down to the parts of thr proposed repository level.] " src="chlrne2.gif " hieght=329 width=559><p>

<p>


Yucca Mountain is cut by several downward-extending faults. The elevated chlorine-36 levels
found at three of five locations in the tunnel occurred in areas that are associated with known
faults. Samples showed elevated levels of chlorine-36 near the entrance to the facility within the
Bow Ridge Fault, near the Drill Hole Wash Structure, and at the intersection of the Sundance
Fault with the facility's tunnel. Two of the samples were found in fractures in the facility, but
were not directly associated with major faults at the surface. <P>
<P>
Scientists believe that faults and fractures can act either as conduits or barriers to the flow of
water in the unsaturated zone. In some locations, these features may have provided the fast
pathways that account for the presence of elevated chlorine-36 levels in the ESF. <P>
<P>
The fact that very little flowing water has been found at the repository depth suggests that the
layers of volcanic rock situated above the potential repository can act as a barrier to water. The
presence of very small amounts of relatively fast-moving water within the area of rock where a
repository might be excavated, though, implies that the barrier may not be uniform. It may be
breached, here and there, by pathways that can move water through the volcanic rock, and into
the underlying rock. 
<H3>
Conceptual Models for  Rapid Flow Pathways</H3>

Researchers have proposed three possibilities that could account for the presence of rapid-flow
pathways through the layers of volcanic rock found above the potential repository horizon.<P>
<P>
The least plausible of these is the existence of a small zone of saturated rock at the top of one of
the tuff units that transmits water by downward flow through the rock largely by way of gravity.
Once this flow has crossed one type of rock, the water may be transmitted to fractures in another
type, and begin to move more rapidly. This is considered unlikely, however, because the time
required for such rapid flow through this rock is too long to account for the presence of the
isotope.<P>
<P>
A second, somewhat more likely possibility, involves the existence of random clusters of
interconnected, vertical fractures. Conceivably, these could capture water entering the volcanic
rock from above, and also water moving through the rock laterally. Available evidence suggests
that the volcanic rock situated above the potential repository is relatively unfractured. But the
data are scarce. They do not exclude the possibility of localized zones in this layer that are
densely fractured. <P>
<P>
If this were the case, however, researchers would expect to find elevated levels of chlorine-36 at
random locations along the ESF. However, several of the occurrences of chlorine-36 detected so
far do not appear to be randomly distributed along the ESF. Rather, they seem to be correlated
with known faults or fractures.<P>
<P>
This leads to the third, and perhaps most likely alternative: that faults like the Bow Ridge and
Ghost Dance faults may be the most likely candidate pathways. This is because these faults are
known to run through all of the mountain's tuff units more or less vertically. <P>
<P>
In nature, as in science, the simplest explanation is often the most probable. But scientists have
not yet studied the faults located within the unsaturated zone sufficiently to permit a definitive
determination. In particular, their hydrologic properties and behavior have not been completely
tested. <P>
<P>
Scientists do, however, think it unlikely that any fast paths that exist ever provided a continuous
flow of water from the surface to the repository horizon. When intersected by the ESF tunnel,
these faults showed no evidence of recent water flow. Probably, any water that did flow
downward through these faults flowed periodically. Most likely, it did so in response to
unusually heavy storms at the surface. 

<H3>A Critical Issue Still To Be Resolved</H3>

A critical issue still to be resolved is whether existing faults can sustain rapid water flow into and
through the unsaturated zone. The preliminary correlation between faults and the occurrences of
elevated chlorine-36 within the ESF would seem to suggest one strong possibility: that some
faults, in some places, and at some times over the last 40 years, provided a quick route down to at
least part of the unsaturated zone.<P>
