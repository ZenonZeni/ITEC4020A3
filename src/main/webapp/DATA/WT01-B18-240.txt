Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This is in response to your letter of July 21, 1992, 
regarding my decision with respect to the Marijuana Rescheduling 
Petition.  

     Your letter correctly states that one of the factors to be 
considered in determining whether a substance has a currently 
accepted medical use in treatment is that it is a scientifically 
established chemical compound capable of reproduction in 
standardized dosages.  While you are also correct in noting that 
Congress placed coca and opium plant materials in Schedule II, 
your attempt to analogize those substances to marijuana, and to 
find inconsistency in their scheduling, fails.  

     In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in Schedule 
II, Congress was very much aware that these plant materials have 
historically been recognized as the source for a variety of 
accepted and useful medications.  Neither of these plants are 
used medicinally as plant material.  In both instances, the 
medically active alkaloids are extracted from the plant material 
after which pharmaceutical compounds capable of reproduction in 
standardized dosages are produced.  These compounds are the 
medications which may then be lawfully marketed in the United 
States.  While indigenous populations in various parts of the 
world brew coca teas, chew coca leaves, and smoke opium for 
various purposes, these practices are not permitted in the United 
States under the Controlled Substances Act.  

     Unlike pharmaceuticals derived from opium and coca leaves, 
the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve the 
scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted from 
the plant material.  Instead, the petition involved unsupported 
claims for the medical use of smoked marijuana.  There is, 
therefore, no inconsistency in my finding that such claims did 
not make a case for accepted medical use in treatment in the 
United States.  

     Very truly yours,  

     Robert C. Bonner
