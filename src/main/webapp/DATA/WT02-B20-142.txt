<b>Performance Assessment and Standardized Testing for Students with Disabilities: Psychometric Issues, Accommodation Procedures, and Outcome Analyses</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023F50007 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>            
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98 <p>

ABSTRACT<P>
PURPOSE:  The project will attempt to gain an understanding of how students with a wide range of disabilities perform on and react to on-demand and in-class performance assessment tasks in mathematics and science.<P>

METHOD:  This investigation will focus on the use of performance assessment tasks as operationalized in a statewide student assessment system and by classroom teachers, with a sample of 4th- and 8th-grade students (N=200 per year) with varying academic abilities.  A two-tiered, cross-sectional group design with two levels of independent variables (nondisabled and disabled) and two levels of subject matter (mathematics and science) will be used.  Students' responses to performance assessment tasks and standardized multiple-choice tests, as well as post-assessment interviews with students, will provide data to answer questions concerning psychometric issues, accommodation procedures, and the utility of different types of assessments for evaluating academic outcomes.  Teachers (at least 20) involved in the administration of the performance assessment instruments will also be interviewed via a structured questionnaire to provide additional data on accommodation procedures and the functioning of students with disabilities on performance assessment tests.  Data analysis will involve MANOVA, multiple regressions, correlational analyses, and descriptive or qualitative features. 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project results will achieve widespread dissemination through the principal investigators' writing and speaking efforts.  Paper presentations and national conferences on children, assessment, and schooling as well as manuscripts submitted to journals will further enhance the impact of this project and facilitate advancement of research on performance assessment with students with disabilities.<P>

<b>Social Relations of Students with Disabilities in Mainstream Classrooms </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023A50033 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine characteristics of peer associates among elementary students with emotional and behavioral disabilities (EBD)and learning disabilities (LD) in general education settings.  The project will examine social network factors in determining these associations, and todevelop a social context assessment battery to facilitate full inclusion of these students by identifying social barriers to their social and academic success. <P>
METHOD:  This study will include 50 students with EBD and 50 with LD from the 4th- and 5th- grades of schools in metropolitan Chicago as well as rural, suburban, and urban areas of North Carolina.  A multi-method survey design will be used to assess features of students and their classroom social networks.  Group surveys will examine social cognitive maps, peer assessments of behavioral and social features, self-reports of academic, social and behavioral features, and self-reports on school conduct, academic achievement, and school violence.  General and special education teachers will also rate students on academic, social, and behavioral characteristics.  A semi-structured interview will be conducted with special education personnel to determine each school's strategies for inclusion.  Statistical analysis will then assess similarity of associates on each social construct identified as well as demographic and social differences between students who do not have disabilities and whether or not they affiliate with students with disabilities. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A technical report will be prepared to outline the application of this study's findings to the training needs of general and special educators who work with students with disabilities in general education classrooms.  Articles will be prepared for publication in scholarly special education, general education, and educational psychology journals.  Findings will also be disseminated to community schools through workshops, written reports, and direct consultation.<P>

<b>Examining Alternatives for Outcome Assessment for Children with Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023F50008 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a total of 12 studies forming a systematic research program on assessment accommodations and alternative assessment approaches that facilitate inclusion of all students in state-wide assessment programs.<P>

METHOD:    The planned research program will include three methodological approaches: (1) comparative studies involving a qualitative examination of the assessment systems in Kentucky and Maryland, as well as an investigation of characteristics of participating students with disabilities and their performance within those systems; (2) studies which involve secondary analyses of existing databases to address critical technical and implementation issues in the assessment of educational outcomes for students with disabilities; and (3) experimental field studies that involve the collection of new data to address several technical issues crucial to the development and modification of state assessment policies.  These studies will incorporate data from approximately 40,000 students with disabilities in these states, and subsamples of students with disabilities who will be exposed to the experimental comparisons.  These studies will explore the following issues: the ways in which assessment and accountability systems must be conceptualized and developed to have the range and flexibility to accommodate all students, including those with disabilities; the relationships between instructional accommodations and accommodations in assessment; issues and concerns of reliability and validity in the use of testing accommodations and adaptation, alternative assessments, and specification of standards and outcomes; and the use of alternative assessments for students with severe cognitive disabilities. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The work of project staff will be of immediate use to those at national, state, and local levels who are striving toward educational systems that are accountable for all students, including those with disabilities.  Reports will be prepared on the synthesis and comparison of the Maryland and Kentucky systems, the summary of data from analysis of secondary data bases, and the findings from experimental field studies on the possible effects of various accommodations and assessment approaches.<P>

<b>Parent and Teacher Congruency on Variations of a Screening Instrument: An Examination </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50009 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/96 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate whether variations in the screening instrument format influence congruence of scores among both parents and the child's teacher. 
METHOD:  The screening instrument to be used is the Developmental Observation Checklist System (DOCS).  The DOCS will be varied by (1) adding pictorial illustrations and examples and (2) adding a response category to the existing response options.  The sample will consist of 100 sets of parents and 100 teachers of children chronologically below the age of 6 years with and without developmental delays, drawn from early intervention and child care programs in Alabama and Georgia.  A 2x2x3 mixed measure analysis of variance will be used to analyze the effects variations in screening instruments have on score congruency among fathers, mothers, and teachers.  Two between-subjects factors with two levels each and one without-subjects factor with three levels will be included in this design.  An equal number of mothers, fathers, and teachers will complete versions of the screening instrument, and a control group of mothers, fathers, and teachers will complete the screening instrument in its original format. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide current research on parental and professional assessment congruency and information on the impact of variations in the screening instrument on this congruency.  Findings will be disseminated through conference presentations, journal articles and a doctoral dissertation paper.<P>

<b>The Influence of Teacher Characteristics on the Academic Performance and Behavioral Adjustment of  Students with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50118 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is improve understanding of the characteristics of teachers that influence both their interactions with students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the behavioral adjustment and academic performance of these students. <P>  METHOD:  The research will be based on a three-year study involving two groups of students, one with ADHD and one of matched comparison students.  In Year One, students with ADHD and matched comparisons will be identified, screened, and assessed for baseline characteristics.  In Years Two and Three, the behavioral adjustment and academic performance of students will be assessed within and between two teachers and two classroom environments to determine the impact of teacher characteristics on school outcome.  The study will include a multimethod assessment of teacher characteristics, student characteristics, and student outcome (behavioral adjustment and academic performance), along with observations of teacher-student interactions.  Statistical analyses will include structural regression procedures based on a hierarchical linear modeling approach to examine change over time.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be incorporated into inservice training workshops throughout New England, and presentations will be made at meetings of national organizations of regular and special educators, school psychologists, parents of children with ADHD, and clinical and developmental psychologists.  Findings will be published in professional journals, and will also be assimilated into University of Massachusetts' masters-level programs in regular and special education, counseling, and school psychology. <P>

<b>Longitudinal Affective and Social Outcomes of Special Education Placement Options for Students with Mild  Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30103 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will assess the stability and change of the social and affectivecharacteristics of children with mild disabilities placed in "segregated" versus "integrated" settingscompared to "at-risk children" and children who are achieving normally. <P>
METHOD:  A total of 300 referred third graders will be randomly selected and matched in termsof age, gender, and ethnicity to 100 third graders identified as achieving normally.  Measurementof social and affective outcomes will include sociometric assessments to assess peeracceptance/rejection, teacher ratings of social skills, self-concept, loneliness, school attitudes, andcritical behavioral events.  In addition, comprehensive assessments of students' school histories will be recorded and quantified from existing school records.  The project will examine both short-term and long-term effects of various educational placements on students' social and affective development using a prospective longitudinal research design. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from this project will be targeted to have an impact in three areas: the academic community and other research activities, the cooperating schooldistricts, the California State Department of Education, and the department's special educationsection.  In addition to the conventional outlets of published reports and conference presentations within the research community, personnel from state school districts will be involved in education community conference presentations and publications to target educators and policymakers. <P>

<b>Utility of Alternative Assessment Models for Identification of Mildly Handicapped Children </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20002 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project intends to establish the utility of alternative assessment vis-a-vis traditional assessment in establishing the eligibility of students with mild disabilities for special education and related services. <P>

METHOD:  Two interrelated studies will be performed.  The first study will compare the extent to which current referral practices and alternative assessment procedures result in identification of the same "at-risk" children as would traditional assessment procedures.  The first study will consist of 135 students evenly divided among three ethnic groups. The students will be studied, assessed, and referred for formal assessment using alternative assessment procedures.  The second study will compare the utility of four alternative assessment models (including dynamic assessment, achievement-achievement discrepancy, neuropsychological, and behavioral models).  Investigators will evaluate 204 students, again stratified among three ethnic groups, using alternative assessment model and traditional assessment models, with order of testing randomized.  Degrees of coincidence and agreement among ethnic groups and between alternative and traditional models will be studied.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from this project will inform policy makers on the utility of alternative assessment for reducing ethnic disproportions; moreover, it will permit informed decisions on the relative merits of the four commonly recommended alternatives. The project will also evaluate any ethnic bias among the models evaluated. <P>

<b>A Path to Literacy for Deaf Children through English and American Sign Language (ASL) </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30074 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will assess the relationship between American Sign Language (ASL) competence and English literacy among deaf school children aged 8 to 15 years.  
METHOD:  Approximately 200 students aged 8 to 15 enrolled in a residential school for the deaf will be tested annually for 3 years.  ASL skills will be measured using a specially devised comprehension test, administered by videotape and requiring a nonverbal response.  English literacy will be measured using the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Test Battery--Revised and a psycholinguistic computer measure developed by the investigator.  Performance IQ will also be assessed.  Research questions will then address the synchronic and diachronic relationships between ASL skills and English literacy, as well as exploring at what age ASL plays its greatest role in facilitating gains in English literacy. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings of research will be disseminated via published research reports, assessment guides, diagnostic manuals, and presentations at national conferences.  Results will serve as a basis for future assessment of ASL and academic performance to be carried out at participating schools to further extend the database.  Follow-up research is expected to implement and evaluate a full-scale literacy program using ASL and English for deaf children in the United States.  This program will serve as a model to numerous groups advocating a "bilingual/bicultural" approach for deaf children, and will therefore have a direct impact on many thousands of deaf students, their families, and their teachers. <P>

<b>A Study to Develop Braille Reading and Writing Norms and Instructional Interventions for Children Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50123 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:   The project will develop normative information on the Minnesota Braille Skills Inventory (MBSI) and establish a compilation of teaching intervention strategies for use by educators in teaching Braille reading and writing skills.<P>

METHOD:  Stage 1 activities will focus on collection of normative data, and will begin with a mailing to approximately 700-1000 teachers of the blind and visually impaired.  Approximately 150-200 of these teachers are expected to participate in such project activities including obtaining parental consent, conducting MBSI assessments, generating effective teaching intervention strategies, and collecting related demographic and family data.  Each teacher will collect this information for 3-5 students.  Each student will receive family information and assessment packets, including background information and a full MBSI as well as a survey to collect information about the student's current level of academic and social-adaptive functioning.  Concurrent with data collection activities, project staff will obtain technical assistance from a database development consultant to design the database, develop data entry systems, and train clerical staff to enter and conduct based analysis of information from teacher participants.  As participants in Stage 2, teachers will be asked to provide a minimum of three teaching/intervention strategies they have found effective in teaching students Braille literacy.  A Braille Intervention Strategies Committee will then be formed to compile these strategies and develop a teaching strategies manual.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Through development and dissemination of the MBSI and its companion compilation of instructional interventions for teachers, teachers of the blind and visually impaired will have access to an instrument that reliably assesses students' reading and writing skills.  Parents will also benefit from access to norm-referenced, performance-based information about their child's present level of Braille literacy. <P>

<b>Commonwealth Institute ADHD Project: Effects of School, Child and Family Variables on Drug   Responsiveness of Children with ADHD</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30082 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will utilize ecobehavioral principles and concepts, within the framework of a robust experimental design, to investigate the effects of school, child, and family variables on drug responsiveness of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). <p>
METHOD:  A sample of 250 children with ADHD, aged 6 to 12 years, will be enrolled in a within-subject, crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response study of methylphenidate, with the placebo and drug order to be determined according to a 3 x 3 Latin square design.  Following a drug-free baseline, children will be randomly rotated through placebo and two active drug conditions, according to one of three experimental sequences.  Drug responsiveness will be analyzed across several variables, including academic performance and curriculum-based measures, teacher and parent ratings of social and maladaptive behaviors, child attributions of treatment effects, and side effects.  Four school variables, five child variables, and four family variables will also be analyzed alongside a host of sociodemographic variables. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Due to the large sample size of this study, the project will be able to provide a mathematical model of drug interactions that will enable researchers to use smaller samples in future studies of this nature.  The data from this study will provide the first comprehensive ecobehavioral assessment of the effects of methylphenidate on children with ADHD.<P>

<b>Stress, Social Support and Adjustment to Middle School Transition in Children with Learning Disabilities</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40155 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to improve understanding of the stress students with learning disabilites experience during and after the transition to middle school, the social support systems they use, and the role that social support plays in the adjustment of these students to the middle school environment.<P>

METHOD:  Project research will focus on: (1) the extent and nature of the stress students with learning disabilities experience during the first years of middle school; (2) the extent and nature of the social support students with learning disabilities receive from family, peers and school personnel; and (3) the role that social support plays in reducing stress and facilitating the adjustment of students with learning disabilities both during and after the transition to middle school.  The subjects will consist of students from the 4th grade (N=360), including 120 students identified as having learning disabilities, 120 students identified as low achievers, and 120 students identified as nondisabled average achievers. During Project Year 1, staff will select students for the 3 study groups, focusing on those students who may be exhibiting extreme behavioral problems.  At this time staff will also ask teachers to complete the School Climate Inventory to assess the heterogeneity of the elementary school represented in the sample.  During Project Years 2 through 4, project procedures will involve the delivery of assessment instruments to students in individual interviews, and questionnaires mailed to the students' families.  Staff will use interview and questionnaire results to assess both school and family climates.  In following student interviews, staff will conduct a variety of stress scale tests to focus on changes in stressors the   student is experiencing. In addition to formal assessment, project staff will monitor and track changes that may occur in family structure and composition, special education services for students, and changes within the school itself.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  With the information gained by this research, educators will be able to focus not only on ways to reduce the stressors of middle school, but on ways to help students with learning disabilities manage their stress with social support.  This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the development of plans and programs designed to facilitate transitions between public school environments. <P>

<b>Project FACILE <br>
(Functional Analysis and Contextual Intervention in Learning Environments) </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20040 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  Project FACILE will study individualized and system-level technologies for improving the educational experiences of students with at-risk behaviors. <P>
METHOD:  The project will conduct a complete functional analysis, use the analysis results to determine the possible communicative function of the behavior in question, and design an intervention to replace the behavior with a prosocial response that serves the same communicative function.  These assessment and intervention procedures will be systematically tested at individual and school or system levels.  Normative rates of at-risk and appropriate social behaviors and social validation data will be used to evaluate the goals, procedures, and outcomes from this project.  School building personnel will be trained to screen for at-risk children, conduct functional analyses, and to design and implement contextual interventions. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Training materials based on empirically validated procedures will be produced to improve practitioners' ability to develop effective intervention strategies for students with at-risk behavior and reduce potential negative outcomes predicted for at-risk students who receive inadequate systematic interventions.  Students with at-risk behavior will increase their prosocial skill level, thereby reducing academic and social risks.  New research-validated knowledge and understanding of effective assessment and intervention strategies will be generated.  Research findings will be disseminated through a variety of professional outlets. <P>

<b>Educational Implications of Surviving Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50058 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/00<p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will attempt to describe and understand, from the multiple perspectives of the survivor and parents, siblings, teachers, and the medical team, the educational and psychosocial consequences of surviving cancer.  The project will also consider the problems student survivors encounter upon returning to school.<P>

METHOD:  In the first study, the sample will be individuals who were diagnosed with childhood leukemia at age 5-7 years, survived, and are now at least 18 years of age.  These youth and their families will share their experiences, including the roles school and schoolwork played during and after treatment, including the response of the school to the illness and any learning difficulties that arose.  A second study will examine survivors at 10-12 years of age, five years after diagnosis.  This study will focus on subjects' recent re-entry experiences, and school personnel will be drawn into the interview sample.  This study will explore what preparations (if any) were made for the child's return to school after treatment and what problems were encountered.  The third study will follow survivors and their families as they experience school re-entry.  Staff will observe students in their classrooms to understand the complex social and psychological issues associated with reintegration.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A concerted effort will be made to ensure that research findings and products are widely disseminated and useful to diverse targeted audiences.  The organization and summaries of findings in the preparation of conference presentations, reports to parents, reports toschools, reports to medical teams, submissions to refereed journals, submissions to teacher magazines, and other materials will therefore be tailored to address the interests and needs of parents, physicians, classmates, teachers, policymakers, and researchers. <P>

METHOD:  Approximately 2,100 adolescents with sensory, orthopedic, or mental disabling conditions will be trained and/or tested on selected physical fitness parameters.  Tests to be employed will include PHYSICAL BEST, the health-related test of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance Fitnessgram; and the physical fitness test of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sport.  Findings from these tests will be used as the basis for the statistical validity of developed criterion-referenced standards.  In addition, a criterion-referenced Project Target Test of Physical Fitness and a corresponding educational program for the development of physical fitness would be created. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As a result of project activities, four national tests of physical fitness will be made more valid, useable, and accessible for adolescents with disabilities.  The project will extend the nation's current emphasis on criterion-referenced testing and programming to school-aged youngsters with disabling conditions. <P>
