<LI>The Fund is performing very well and is in the top third of its Lipper peer group on a year-to-date basis.  The Fund's yield exceeds that of its yield benchmark, the 5-year Treasury note, by 74 basis points.
<LI>Yields in the intermediate portion (maturities ranging from 3-10 years) of the Treasury yield curve ended the third quarter unchanged.  Volatility was a prevalent factor, however, with yields fluctuating within a 60 basis point trading range.
<LI>During the quarter, we increased the Fund's investment in Treasury notes by 8% to 74%.  We reduced our holding in the agency note sector to 5% as the spreads had become too tight to compensate for the lower liquidity in that market.

<B><I>Information presented is for the Fund's I Shares. The yield provided is for the 30 days through the end of the above period. Average annual total returns were</I></B> 4.13%, 2.44%, 5.46% <B><I>and</I></B> 6.79% <B><I>for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods, respectively, for the period ending 9/30/96. These returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. During this period, some of the Fund's fees may have been waived; if these fees were not waived, total return would have been lower. Results represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.</I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.</I></B></I>
