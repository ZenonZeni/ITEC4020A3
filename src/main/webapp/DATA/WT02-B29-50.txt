<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Estimate Your Income Needs</STRONG></FONT><P>

To begin, you need to estimate your income needs. Include in this figure your housing expenses,
an
estimate of food, transportation, clothing, insurance, health-related and other miscellaneous
expenses.
If you wish to travel or pursue a hobby during your retirement, you'll need to include an
estimate of
the
additional expenses. Compare the sum of these expense items with the sum of your income. If your
sources of income are insufficient for your needs, you might want some of your retirement plan
distribution to produce an additional stream of income. But if it were only that simple!
<P>

<STRONG>Don't forget inflation!</STRONG><BR>
Years ago,  you could go to a movie for 25 cents. Popcorn would cost you another 15
cents, and a soda 10 cents. Fifty cents would get you a whole afternoon's entertainment! Now,
even
bargain movies cost you a whole lot more than that!
<P>
What's the point? Inflation! If you're receiving your distribution now because you're retiring
and
don't
intend to work at another income-producing job, it is critical that you consider the effect of
inflation. To
maintain the lifestyle you want, you'll need to take steps to assure that your income at least
keeps
pace
with inflation.
<P>
How does inflation affect the value of your money? Let's assume that in the first year you have a
total of
$40,000 in income. Let's further assume an annual inflation rate of 3%. After five years, your
$40,000
will buy $35,504 worth of goods at today's prices. In 10 years, it will be worth only $29,764
at
today's
prices. Keep in mind that you may have 20, 25 or more years of retirement to look forward to, and
inflation higher than the 3% estimated here would have an even more dramatic effect.
<P>
Of particular concern is the cost of medical care, which you are more likely to need as you grow
older.
These costs are rising at a far faster rate than other costs. You must therefore consider the
effect
inflation will have on your ability to maintain your lifestyle. The problem is not as monumental
as
it may
sound. There are many investment alternatives that have the objective of helping your nest egg to
grow
in size - so that your purchasing power can stay constant (or possibly increase), even while
inflation
erodes the value of a dollar. In a way, basic economic and investment principles become your
"partners" as you work to realize your expectations.
