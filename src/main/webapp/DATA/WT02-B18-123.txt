<b>2. Basic Activities during the SBSR</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Several activities are being planned for the VIII SBSR: courses, tutorials,
seminars, technical sessions, invited talks, technical exhibitions, and
multimidia. <p>
<p>
<b>2.1. Courses</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Four courses are being presently organized: GIS; Microwave Remote
Sensing; Introduction to the Digital Integration of Radar Data with Auxiliary
Data (TM-Landsat, Geological, Aerogeophysical) for Purposes of Geological
Exploration; and Introduction to GPS and Applications. Each course will have
duration of 16 hours and will be offered on April 13 and 14 (Saturday and
Sunday). The cost is R$ 200,00/course. <p>
<p>
<b>2.2. Tutorials</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Two tutorials will be offered during the VIII SBSR: Spectral Optical Radiometry
and Applications of Geoprocessing, with Emphasis on Enviroment. Each tutorial
is programmed for 4 hours and the cost is R$ 35,00.<p>
<p>

<p>
<b>2.3. Technical Sessions</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Technical Sessions refer to <b>ARTICLES</b> (to be presented in a plenary
session during 15 minutes, plus 5 minutes for questions) and
<b>COMMUNICATIONS</b> (to be presented in poster sessions). Articles and
Communications will both be submitted to the Scientific Committee. ARTICLES
concentrate on presentation of (a) recent and original developments concerning
methodologies; or (b) final techniques or results from projects, using Remote
Sensing and/or GIS.<p>
<p>
<b>ARTICLES</b> are limited to 6 pages, following the attached format.
Additional pages will be charged, up to a limit of 10 pages. The ARTICLES will
be judged considering (a) and (b) above.<p>
<p>
<b>COMMUNICATIONS</b> refer to studies (projects) still in development, for
which only partial results are available on: (a) methodologies or techniques;
(b) remote sensing applications; (c).GIS. The COMMUNICATIONS shall be submitted
as Expanded Abstracts, with no more than two pages. The format for
COMMUNICATIONS is the same as for ARTICLES.<p>
<p>
The deadline for submission of papers to the VIII SBSR is November, 30, 1995,
either as ARTICLE or COMMUNICATION. These must conform to the format annexed to
this. The ARTICLES will be judged by a Technical-Scientific Committee to be
presented in a plenary session, whereas COMMUNICATIONS will be restricted to
poster presentation. The Committee reserves the right to suggest that an
ARTICLE be presented in a poster session or vice-versa.<p>
<p>
The ARTICLE or COMMUNICATION submmited by November 30, if accepted, will be
published in the Proceedings of the Symposium as is.<p>
