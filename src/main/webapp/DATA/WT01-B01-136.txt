<B>The Cost of Independence: The Economic Decline of Russian Media</B><P>

Ever since the 1991 coup, the Russian media have made tremendous progress in defending their right to cover the news independently. The "fourth estate" in Russia is considered the most liberal, democratic institution in the country, in contrast to the government and the parliament, which have often reverted to Soviet-style information control. Journalists reporting the truth now play the role once limited mainly to dissident writers and scientists.<P>

But that independence, brought about in part by privatization of property following the 1992 market reforms, is very loosely defined and vulnerable to government and economic pressure. Jamey Gambrell, an American journalist based in Moscow who writes frequently on the Russian media, told CPJ in an e-mail interview on April 11: "Independent" is a tricky concept these days. Does it mean "founded on private capital"? Free-thinking? Founded after the fall of the U.S.S.R. (i.e. not started on the basis of one of the old dinosaurs)?" <P>

In fact, there are very few media outlets that are entirely financed independently. The Russian Media Institute reported in 1995 that almost 90 percent of the media are estimated to rely to a greater or lesser extent on government subsidies <CITE>(Post-Soviet Media Law & Policy Newsletter</CITE>, Issue 29, April 1996). <P>

The national press, in particular, is faced with new headaches as a result of privatization: loss of state subsidies for newsprint, drastic falls in subscription rates, and spiraling taxes and postage. As for broadcast media, even privately owned stations, like the country's most fiercely independent channel NTV or the partially private station ORT, depend on state-controlled transmitters and satellites. In this severe economic climate, both television and the print media have been forced to seek investment from business groups with close ties to the government and strong editorial preferences. Media owners make no secret of their preference for Yeltsin. Indeed, one prominent owner of TV stations and other independent media outlets, Boris Berezovsky, was among the group of 13 businessmen who in May publicly called for a postponement of the elections as a solution to the Yeltsin vs. Zyuganov dilemma.<P>

Meanwhile, the public has grown distrustful of the media. Some hard-pressed newspapers have been criticized for using underworld connections to sell advertising or accused of publishing <CITE>dzhintsa</CITE>, paid political or business puff pieces (so named for the once coveted items on the black market, <CITE>dzhintsy</CITE>, or blue jeans).<P>

<B>The Economic Plight and Political Dependence <BR>
of Media in the Provinces<BR>
</B><BR>
Last year's Communist victory in the parliamentary elections revealed that even Yeltsin's grip on national television stations and papers may not guarantee a victory for his side. Surveys show that most Russians in the provinces--where the presidential elections will be decided--get their news from local state-owned television stations and papers, many of which are pro-Communist. And many new Communist supporters among the pensioners and the recently unemployed do not believe what they hear on television and are too poor to pay for the more expensive, independent newspapers and magazines.<P>

The real news of the upcoming presidential elections may be that the Communists never left power, particularly in Russia's "Red Belt," the poorest areas of the country where subsidized factory directors and local apparatchiks still rule. Some provincial editors used to be district officials in the Communist Party, and newspapers in the provinces survive on subsidies from district or regional governments. The papers there are "careful not to write about too many potholes," one provincial journalist told CPJ, or they may face lawsuits for not being "objective." Most regional governors are Yeltsin appointees and have sometimes forcefully brought the media in their areas to heel. As can be seen from reports about Kostroma, Kaluga, Orenburg, and other cities in <CITE>Choice of the Regions</CITE>, a Russian e-mail bulletin on the media published by the Russian-American Press and Information Center in Moscow, "balanced coverage" is largely the artificial result of editors trying to keep two masters happy.<P>

Eric Johnson of Internews in Moscow told CPJ in an e-mail discussion on May 30, how this works: "Ten years ago, each republic, region, country, and city of any size had its own paper, totally controlled by the [local] governments (in effect, the Party). Starting five years ago the newspapers in many cases squirmed out from under government control  ... [through their own efforts to gain outside revenue or investment]. But in many cases the papers have found they can't really make it on their own. By far their largest costs are paper, printing, and distribution, and the sources of all three of these services are still for the most part government-owned. And the prices they charge have been rising quickly ... far faster than ad revenue and subscribers' ability to pay. ... So the governments were asked to, and assented to, subsidize the local, formerly governmental newspapers." This support usually has been given in exchange for editorial consent to publish materials the local government feels are important.<BR>
