The North-East Victoria Region has three identifiable areas; Central
Goulburn, Central Murray and the Alpine area. Albury-Wodonga is the largest centre
in the North-East Victoria Region and is one of Victoria's largest
and most important provincial centres. It is Australia's National
Growth Centre.
<P>
The North-East Victoria Region also covers Wangaratta and Shepparton/Kyabram/Tatura,
which are very important industrial districts. The other main
industrial centres in the region are Benalla and Seymour.
<P>
Information on Albury-Wodonga's industrial strengths and the other
larger centres in North-East Victoria and the districts that surround
them is provided in this regional profile.
<P>
In addition to the larger industrial centres, the North-East Victoria
Region covers other towns - Rutherglen, Yarrawonga, Cobram, Strathmerton,
Beechworth, Tallangatta, Corryong, Mansfield, Mt Beauty and Bright
-which have significant industrial features.
<P>
The key industrial features of these towns and rural districts
of North-East Victoria are;
</FONT>
<H2>Rutherglen</H2>
<P>
Rutherglen is well known for its fortified and table wines.  Although
the majority of wineries have fewer than ten employees each, the
total number is considerable.  Wine festivals and events attract
interstate and overseas visitors.  Agriculture Victoria's
Research Station, located close to Rutherglen in a crop growing
area, is highly regarded throughout Australia.
<H2>Yarrawonga, Cobram, Strathmerton</H2>
<P>
Murray Goulburn Cooperative produces cheese at Cobram.  In summer
the population of Yarrawonga and Cobram swells by up to seven
times due to water skiing, golf and river recreational clubs.
<P>
The Central Murray Regional Development Corporation, comprising
representatives from both sides of the border, is active in attracting
industry and is producing a development strategy.
<P>
A large producer of stainless steel tanks for commercial vehicles
is at Strathmerton where Kraft produces Philadelphia cheese and
is undertaking a major processing plant expansion.
<H2>Beechworth, Tallangatta, Corryong</H2>

<P>
The area supports many softwood and hardwood plantations.  Beechworth
has an important tourism industry based around the history of
the outlaw Kelly Gang, Victorian streetscapes and the district's
natural beauty.  The town is also the location of historic Beechworth
Gaol.
<P>
An abattoir at Tallangatta employs fifty-five people and recently
a peppermint distillery was established at Corryong.  Its progress
is being monitored by both the State and Federal Governments.
 The area is famous for its prime beef production and local farmers
are introducing breeds new to farming in Australia, including
bison, llama, ostrich and deer.
<H2>Mansfield, Myrtleford, Mt Beauty, Bright</H2>

<P>
Tobacco is the main agricultural product at Myrtleford.  Seeds
are grown in Mansfield.  The high country has tourist festivals
and attractions based on ski resorts at Mt Hotham, Dinner Plain,
Falls Creek, Mt Buffalo and Mt Buller.
<P>
The entire high country is attracting visitors in increasing numbers
throughout the rest of the year.  Its magnificent character has
become folklore, particularly since the film <I>The Man from Snowy
River.</I>
<P>
Timber industries operate here including Australian Forests Industries
in Myrtleford and Mt Beauty Timber Industries.  Employment in
the timber industry within Victoria's alpine area is estimated
at 1,500.
