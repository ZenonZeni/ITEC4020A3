<font size=+1><b>RAY'S PHILOSOPHY</b></font><p>

</center>

Objectives, investment time-horizons, risk tolerance, income needs, tax circumstances and estate consideration are unique to each of us as individuals.  As a result, a successful financial program should be designed with an eye to meeting the goals, aspirations and lifestyle that are specific to each client.  The cornerstone of this process is building a stable, long-term relationship based on integrity, trust, respect and understanding.<p>

Ray says this about his investment philosophy:<p>

<blockquote>

<i>"My investment approach is conservative.  Instead of trying to second guess what markets will do, I make decisions based on prudent diversification and long term value.  Preserviation of capital is always of primary concern."</i>

</blockquote>
