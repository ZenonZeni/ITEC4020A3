From the PENTAGON
FY '91 DOD BUDGET AUTHORITY AT $295 BILLION

      The FY '91 Department of Defense (051 function) budget
authority figure is set at about $295 billion, congressional
sources tell Defense Industry Report. The President tentatively
approved an FY '91 DoD budget outlay figure of $292.15 billion
last week.  The FY '91 (050) (DoD and Department of Energy)
outlays are around $301 billion, while the budget authority is
around $307 billion.  DoD ended up with a budget authority of
$292 billion in fiscal 1990, with outlays of $287 billion.

STREAMLINING TO SAVE DOD $39 BILLION THROUGH FY '95

     Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney announced last week that
$39 billion will be saved in the Department of Defense budget
between FY '91 and FY '95 through management streamlining as a
result of the Defense Management Report (DMR).

Cheney said $2.3 billion will be saved in FY '91, which is
included in the four year savings.  He said that in FY '91,
16,000 military and civilian personnel and 42,000 personnel
through FY '95 will be trimmed from the logistics and management
work force of 580,000.  Cheney said these cut backs were
efficiency-related cutbacks and not a part of force structure
included in the FY '91 budget.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood said most of the
personnel cutbacks will be absorbed through the DoD's normal
attrition rate, which he said is much higher than the total to be
trimmed.

Atwood said the Pentagon is implementing major cultural changes
in the way DoD is run and the way its purchasing system works.
The Administration's legislative policy will be developed by the
Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The DMR was issued in July 1989 after President Bush directed
Cheney to devise and implement the recommendations of the Packard
Commission to improve defense acquisition, and better manage DoD.

A legislative task force under the direction of the legislative
counsel and former Secretary of the Army, Jack Marsh, reviewed
existing statutes and recommended changes that improve DoD
efficiency. The task force recommended that following areas be
improved: production, acquisition and logistics; military and
civilian personnel; environment; and department finances.
    The report also calls for the overhaul of the "statutory
framework for DoD acquisition."  Strengthening of the defense
industrial base, improved observance of ethical standards in
government and industry, and improving defense management were
outlined by Atwood as essential to the successful "cultural
changes" necessary for the success of the management overhaul.

To strengthen the industrial base, Under Secretary of Defense
(Acquisition) John Betti said during an informal meeting with the
press, that the Pentagon must create incentives and eliminate
"disincentives" for industry to invest in new facilities and
equipment as well as research and development.  Betti said the
process should be made easier for industry and the DoD.

Atwood outlined the following points that would improve defense
management:
  *  Reducing overhead while maintaining military strength;
  *  enhancing weapon systems program performance;
  *  reinvigorating the planning and budget process;
  *  reducing micromanagement;
  *  strengthening the defense industrial base;
  *  and improving observance of ethical standards in government
        and industry.

Betti told reporters that one way to tighten the acquisition
process is to keep disciplined milestones.  He said many problems
have occurred as a result of concurrency.  Under the new
streamlined system programs with problems would not be allowed to
proceed, or in essence postponed, until the problems are cleared
up.  Betti said that because there was a need for certain
programs, most would not be terminated, but in a case where the
need for a troubled program changes, termination may be
justified.

Betti said the most difficult issues will be those problem-
plagued programs already in the system. "We had to figure out a
way of not throwing the baby out with the bath water," Betti
said.  He said if the program was not brought on track it would
prove to be a greater problem "as it heads farther down stream.
That's just management, but if circumstances warrant it, we'll
terminate it."

AF SEES NEARLY $11 BILLION IN DMR CUTS FROM FY 1991-95

     Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said last week that the
service is projecting more than $10 billion in cuts from
acquisition and logistics for FY 1991-95, in line with the
Administration's Defense Management Review (DMR), and a further
$1.7 billion cut from Air Force-wide operational and training
initiatives.

Overall DMR savings for the service would come to about $10.9
billion in cuts over the five year period and would entail the
loss of 14,600 civilian personnel and 8,800 military posts (these
figures do not include civilianization of military support
positions).  Total cuts for FY '91 would amount to $950 million,
and the loss of 8,300 civilian and 5,150 military personnel.

Major changes the Air Force intends to make include: Cutting
$9.15 billion over the five year period ($750 million for FY `91)
from the acquisition command services (AF Systems Command,
Logistics Command, and Communications Command) to streamline the
acquisition process--this includes cutting 14,400 civilian and
4,300 military personnel; cutting $1.750 billion ($200 million
from FY `91) from operational and training programs--including
200 civilian and 4,500 military personnel.

The service also plans to institute a three-level chain that
provides a "direct line of command for major acquisition programs
from the assistant secretary of the Air Force to six newly
created program executive officers (PEOs)," and developing career
military and civilian acquisition officers through training and
education.

DOD INSPECTOR GENERAL ENDORSES DMR

      Defense Department Inspector General Susan J. Crawford said
recently that she fully backs the initiatives contained in the
Defense Management Review, released last week, as a logical
extension of the Packard Commission Report and Goldwater-Nichols
Reorganization Act as important steps to streamline and promote
efficiency in the Pentagon acquisitions process.

At the same time, she said, "we need to dispel any notion" that
tough Pentagon auditing and accounting practices in any way make
private business dealings with the Pentagon unprofitable "We have
not lost a proper sense of perspective."

Pushing for "aggressive ethics training,"  Crawford said there is
a need to "clarify rules to" the defense contracting community.
She made note of her office's role in reversing "the perception
of fraud" within the Pentagon.   Calling the DoD audit community
a "leading force" in acquisition reform, she emphasized that the
IG is "clearly concerned" about safeguarding the public trust
from fraud and abuse.  * * * * * * * * * *

DOD TO MEET WITH CONGRESS ON BLUEPRINT FOR DMR

     The Defense Department has agreed to hold an "acquisition
summit" with defense leaders of Congress  "to work on concrete
steps" to implement the recommendations of the new Defense
Management Report and to develop "a scorecard to measure
effectiveness," Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) of the House Armed
Services Committee reported last week.
Aspin said the DMR "offers no blueprint for implementation.
The acquisition summit was requested [possibly for late this
month] by eight members of Congress, including the Democratic and
Republican leaders of the two Armed Services Committees.  In a
January 9 letter to Defense Secretary Cheney, the eight urged "an
informal dialogue between the executive and legislative branches
to foster a more collegial approach for implementing acquisition
reform." Objective: "To organize in a bipartisan manner a
specific strategy for implementation," including: Defining a list
of specific improvements in acquisition that implements the
letter and spirit of the Packard initiatives; creating a
scorecard that measures progress in implementing the Packard
changes. The objective is to develop "an expectation or a
standard that is agreed to at the beginning for measuring the
status of implementation.  This scorecard could be the basis for
informal efforts to monitor and measure progress."

A-12 COST AND THE NAVY'S FIVE-YEAR AIRCRAFT PLAN

     A serious flap is now brewing over the cost of the Navy's
classified A-12 Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program,
following revelations last year of the much-higher-than-expected
costs for the classified B-2 bomber, which has put the number of
bombers to be procured in question, and of the Air Force Advanced
Tactical Fighter, which led one committee to attempt to zero the
program.

An indication that the cost of the A-12 would be $96 million per
copy was first reported last Wednesday by the Philadelphia
Inquirer.

The source was the just-released transcript of hearings by the
House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee last year, and the
following question submitted for the record by a committee
member:

"The January 1989 [Reagan Administration] budget [for fiscal
1990] included A-12 production through fiscal year 1994 of 106
aircraft for $10.2 billion.

Under the original budget profile, the Navy's medium attack force
would have been 75 percent A-12s and 25 percent A-6Es well beyond
the year 2000. How many A-6E aircraft will still be operating in
the year 2005 based on the amended [Bush Administration] budget
plans?"

The Navy responded that its desire is that "there will be no
active operational A-6E aircraft operating in fiscal year 2005.
The President's budget includes A-12 procurement" [deleted].

The Pentagon is declining comment on the matter, with some
officials quoted as saying that the number is in error.

OT&E TO ISSUE CAS/BAI AIRCRAFT FLY-OFF TEST PLAN APRIL 1

     The director of Operational Test and Evaluation will be
issuing a test plan for the Close Air Support (CAS)/Battlefield
Air Interdiction (BAI) aircraft fly-off around April 1 and a
Defense Acquisition Board review of the plan will follow shortly
after, an Air Force official told Defense Industry Report last
week.

The aircraft to be studied at the request of Congress are a
CAS/BAI modified F-16, the F/A-18, a modified A-10, the AV-8B
Harrier and the YA-7F (A-7 upgrade).  The A-10 Thunderbolt II can
no longer effectively carry out it CAS/BAI mission and the Air
Force has openly supported an A-16, a modified F-16.

The Air Force official said he does not anticipate any changes in
the CAS/BAI direction in 1991, but declined to comment on FY '91
CAS/BAI funding levels.  The Air Force allocated $56.8 million
for RDT&E in FY '90 for 146 CAS modified Block 30 F-16s, $20
million for 225 modified A-10s and a prototype program for two
YA-7F planes at a cost of $97.2 million over FY '89-90.

CODSIA REVIEWING OMB RESTRICTIONS ON LOBBYING

     An ad hoc task group of the Council of Defense and Space
Industry Associations (CODSIA) is currently reviewing Interim
Final Guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) on December 20 concerning new restrictions on lobbying
activities and may issue a response to the government asking for
clarification on some of the guidelines, industry sources tell
Defense Industry Report.

The impetus for the new restrictions stems from legislation
sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) last year which prohibits
the use of appropriated funds for lobbying. An OMB source said
last month that the Office had decided that "all levels of
subcontractors would be held accountable" under the lobbying
restrictions.

According to one industry source, there are a number of areas of
concern in the OMB guidelines but "depending on how the language
is interpreted, there may be no problems." He noted that the ad
hoc group "has to narrow down the troublesome issues in the
guidelines, agree on them, and keep them to significant areas."

One area he pointed to that may contain problems is the "question
of allowability of costs for full-time employees engaged in
certain activities." He described these costs as either direct or
indirect and associated with a particular contract. "We want more
clarity in these regulations. We need to know the parameters of
the playing field."

Industry's comments to OMB must be submitted by February 18.

V-22 SUPPORTER BEGIN EFFORT TO COUNTER TERMINATION

    Congressional supporters of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft
program will begin informal meetings this week to formulate
strategy in light of the Administration's attempt to terminate
the controversial program again in the FY '91 defense budget,
congressional supporters of the program told Defense Industry
Report last week.

"We need to sit down and form a grand strategy," a source said
recently. "This is not the final decision (the Administrations
budget). The final decision is to be made by Congress."

Last year the Administration unsuccessfully attempted to kill the
V-22 but proponents eventually won $255 million for R&D,
retaining the project another year.  Sources also said the
termination of the V-22 could have a negative effect on the
Army's LHX helicopter program, with V-22 backers retaliating
against the LHX.
"Initially there were major fights over the LHX," the source
said. "I thought they (Congress) might have cut it last year.
Right now it is birdseed (inexpensive), but when it gets to
procurement it's going to be a big ticket program. That is when
it will have trouble."

The real fight over the LHX is expected in FY '92, when the up to
$180 billion in DoD budget cuts are to be effected.

CBO LIST OF POSSIBLE $18.5 BILLION IN DOD CUTS

     The Congressional Budget Office, in warning last week of an
$11.4 billion shortfall in funding for 30 tactical
missiles/torpedoes in the Five-Year Defense Plan [not including
the proposed $140-$180 billion in cuts to the FYDP], listed as
one option, cancellation or deferral of seven programs, which it
said would save $18.5 billion in the FYDP which could be used to
make up the missile shortfalls They are:

     *  F-l5: cancel remaining procurement.  Saving: $4.2
billion.
     *  AV-8B: cancel procurement. Saving: $1.2 billion.
     *  F-16: slow buy to 72 per year. Saving: $3.5 billion.
     *  SSN-688: cancel final submarine. Saving: $800 million.
     *  DDG-51: slow procurement to 3 per year. Saving: $6.4
billion.
     *  ADATS: cancel. Saving: $1.6 billion.
     *  Bradley Fighting Vehicle: slow procurement to 420 a year.

NAVY P-7 PROGRAM MAY BE ON TERMINATION LIST IN FY '91

     Faced with $180 billion in potential Department of Defense
cuts between 1992-'94, the Navy's $7.9 billion P-7 advanced anti-
submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft program could be terminated in
the FY '91 budget because of design problems and scheduling
delays, Navy and congressional sources tell Defense Industry
Report.

However, Lockheed Spokesman Jim Ragsdale said that although
errors in the full-scale engineering development stage has cost
Lockheed $300 million in a fourth quarter 1989 write-off, the
delay has not cost the Navy additional money. Ragsdale said he
has heard nothing of the Navy terminating the P-7 program.

Lockheed won the contract for the P-7 as a follow-on to the P-3
ASW aircraft. It said that the basic body of the aircraft would
be the same, according to sources. Ragsdale said that following
specific tests during the full-scale engineering development
stage "We found it wasn't as possible to have commonality between
parts." That had an effect on scheduling and sources say it
required a redesigned aircraft "from the ground up."

Ragsdale could not say how long the delay would be, but said
Lockheed would formulate a detailed reassessment in the near
future.

Lockheed defeated Boeing and McDonnell Douglas to develop a Long
Range Air Anti-submarine Warfare Capability Aircraft (LRAACA) in
Oct. 1988. The other contractors had proposed building a LRAACA
from existing planes.

The Navy originally planned to procure 125 P-7s at a flyaway cost
of $39.1 million in then-year dollars.

MISSILE FUNDING COULD BE CUT DISPROPORTIONATELY--CBO

     Funding for missiles over the next five years may be cut by
disproportionately large amounts based on past practices, leaving
the services with less than adequate stocks of modern munitions,
according to a new study (*) released by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO).

The actual amount requested for munitions in 1990 was reduced by
42 percent from the previous Administration's 1990 estimate, CBO
said.

To meet requirements set by the services for 30 modern missiles
would require nearly $11.4 billion in additional funding over the
five-year level proposed by the Bush Administration, the report
said.  The 1990 Bush defense budget, which is what the CBO study
is based on, called for a ten percent cut in overall funding for
conventional munitions.

Over the next five years, between 1990 and 1994, the
Administration had planned to spend $9.1 billion on munitions
programs that have initial funding (either for procurement or
development) included in the initial 1990-1991 budget request.

These included: Follow-on to Lance $.8 billion (R&D); Non-Line-
of-Sight $1.6 billion (procurement and R&D); Advanced Antitank
Weapon System $2 billion (procurement and R&D); ASAT $1.4 billion
(R&D); Navy Joint Standoff Weapon System $.2 billion (R&D); Sea
Lance $1.2 billion (procurement and R&D); Air Force Joint
Standoff Weapon $.3 billion (R&D); Short-Range Attack Missile-
Strategic $1.3 billion (procurement and R&D); Short-Range Attack
Missile-Tactical $.3 billion (R&D).

B-2 TO UNDERGO STRUCTURAL CHANGES

     An auto-pilot system and computer software are being
integrated into the B-2 Stealth Bomber along with structural
changes to increase load-bearing and speed capabilities during
its five month lay-up period, Air Force officials told Defense
Industry Report last week.

One official said that the auto-pilot, which was planned early
on, was not integrated earlier because the package had not
arrived in time.  He also said the software will be used in the
B-2's sophisticated computer system auto-pilot.
Sources said the structural changes are necessary to prepared the
aircraft for the Radar Cross Section (RCS) or Low Observable (LO)
testing to take place in the Phase II test period.  Sources told
Defense Industry Report that new bolts are being installed on the
wings of the stealthy aircraft to improve its load-bearing
capabilities. They also said that "a couple" RCS profiles will be
flown in Phase I, which are practice runs for the aircraft to
prepare for Phase II. Specifics on RCS testing are classified.

Overall, 13 B-2s will be built with the second bomber expected in
April.  Sources say six of the first 13 are delegated for testing
and three of those six are in the final stages of construction.

The first two planes are for testing all aspects of the plane,
while the remaining test planes handle load bearing tests, flight
control regression testing (which tests the integrating of the
auto-pilot and software in the aircraft), and radar cross section
testing.

GEC AVIONICS PLANS 700 DEFENSE JOB CUT

    Faced with a decline in defense export orders, Britain's GEC
Avionics, which supplies equipment to the U.S. Air Force, plans a
cut of 700 employees over the next two years.  GEC says the
reduction reflects a decline in the current export program and is
not a reflection of concern for the future of the defense
business. It added, however, that it will reassess the situation
in 1992 for a possible reversal of the current downtrend.  GEC
Avionics is part of the GEC Marconi defense group and is heavily
engaged in the defense export market.

YF-23 MAY FLY IN FEBRUARY

      The Northrop/McDonnell Douglas Advanced Tactical Fighter
(ATF) team will probably conduct its first flight test on the
YF-23 prototype in February, sources tell us.  The
Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics team could not be reached for
comment as to its schedule.

The first of two prototypes was delivered to the Air Force in
October and the second is "in a very advanced stage of
construction," a source said.

Sources said the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas twin-engine
"stealthy" prototypes are not in "flying wing" form like the B-2
bomber, but more like a conventional fighter.  Both have
virtually identical airframes, but the second plane may have more
advanced avionics, according to sources.  The Air Force has not
released photos of the plane.

One plane will be powered by new twin Pratt & Whitney F-119
engines, which are capable of cruising at supersonic speeds
without afterburners, according to an industry source.  This
makes the engines fuel efficient and less visible to infrared
sensors.  The F-119 is also capable of thrust vectoring, or
thrust manipulation, the source said.

The other will use twin General Electric F-120 engines, which are
derivatives of the GE F-110.  The engine will have thrust
vectoring nozzles that allow the engine thrust to be manipulated
in similar fashion to the Harrier fighter, but a source said it
will not hover.       * * * * * * * * * *

GE-SANDERS DELIVER INEWS ADM FOR YF-22

     The Sanders-General Electric INEWS team said last week that
it has delivered its initial Advanced Development Model (ADM) of
the advanced electronic warfare system to the Lockheed/
Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 team competing for the Advanced
Tactical Fighter (ATF).

[The teams of Sanders-GE and TRW-Westinghouse were selected for
Phase IB Dem/Val of INEWS in l986. The two teams were awarded $70
million increments 16 months ago for development of INEWS for ATF
and ATA, with work to be completed by December l990.]

The joint Air Force/Navy INEWS (Integrated Electronic Warfare
System) program is developing advanced modular electronic warfare
technology for the ATF and for avionics "upgrades" of the Navy's
A-12 Advanced Tactical Aircraft and existing platforms.

The ADM, which includes radar warning, electronic support
measures, and missile warning functions, will be used to
demonstrate overall avionics integration and sensor fusion and
will support avionics integration and testing of the Lockheed
team's ground-based laboratory and avionics flying laboratory.

According to Sanders, the ADM demonstrates advanced multi-
spectral sensor integration and common integrated processing,
improved direction finding and emitter identification accuracy
while operating in a high density signal environment.  It employs
real-time embedded Ada software hosted on the YF-22's common
integrated processor.

Lockheed Sanders President John Kreick said that testing of the
ADM, which will be used to determine the INEWS full-scale
development configuration, will "lessen the system integration
challenges encountered in some other recent EW programs,"
including processing architecture, total avionics integration,
radio frequency compatibility and software risk management.

Sanders will deliver a second ADM next month, which will undergo
range and receiver density testing and integration with other ATF
avionics at the YF-22 team's laboratory in Fort Worth.  A
spokesman declined further comment on the INEWS schedule.

The new hard carbon coating is designed to last the 20-plus years
life of the aircraft and night vision system. The previous
coating, thorium fluoride, protects the windows for three years.
The new coating will be applied to the 161 new TADS/PNVS systems
on order and to 584 previously delivered units when their
original lens coating wears out.

JSTARS TO BEGIN FULL FUNCTIONALITY TESTING THIS YEAR

      The Air Force/Army Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar
System (JSTARS) is expected to become fully functional late this
year as the full-scale development (FSD) program moves toward its
conclusion, Grumman officials told Defense Industry Report last
week.

Meanwhile, in light of events in Eastern Europe Grumman is
assessing the feasibility of using the long-range surveillance
and battle management system for monitoring Warsaw Pact forces in
a future post-INF environment.

Once the program moves into phase eight, or full functionality,
JSTARS' phased-array radar antenna will be able to perform all of
its operational requirements, including synthetic aperture
functions.  This summer, the two 707 test aircraft will be turned
over to the Air Force and Army for operational test and
evaluation, which may last as long as 12 months.  An early 1991
contract award is anticipated; the Air Force plans to procure 22
JSTARS aircraft at a cost of $6.6 billion (including R&D);
another $1.1 billion will be spent for construction of 100 ground
stations.  JSTARS is slated for a 1997 deployment.

Although the primary focus of JSTARS has been and remains the
monitoring rear of echelon Warsaw Pact forces on the Central
European battlefield, "the Air Force and we see its efficacy as a
warning and verification instrument as we proceed to Open Skies
agreements and things of that sort," the officials said.


Grumman is also looking at the use of JSTARS in special
operations, low intensity conflict (SOLIC) scenarios and drug
intervention, officials said.  Senior Army TRADOC officials were
briefed on these areas late last month and showed interest,
although they said a great deal of analysis would have to be done
on the service's future roles prior to committing to JSTARS,
Grumman noted.  In addition, representatives of Central Command
recently made presentations at an industry forum which detailed
the potential application of JSTARS technology for supporting
SOLIC.  "I think what we are seeing is that the services are
looking at additional applications of systems, due to budgetary
constraints and the changing threat, which they did not look at
before," one Grumman official said.

SWEDEN LOOKS AT PRODUCING BATTLE TANK

     Sweden is continuing to study various tank design concepts
in the hopes of producing its own Main Battle Tank, the MBT-2000,
for service into the next century, Swedish officials tell Defense
Industry Report.  Swedish industry officials also tell us the
system may hit the international market after domestic
deployment.

The officials said a variety of options are on the drawing board
for a system to defeat all vehicles in its class as well as
future designs.  Sweden is also considering installation of a 140
mm high velocity penetrating projectile cannon.
The Swedish Defense Ministry, however, has not ruled out the
possibility of procuring the system from a foreign supplier.
Several U.S. and European models are being considered for the
role, including the M1A2, the German Leopard II, the British
Challenger II and the French Le Clerc.

Another option the nation is holding open is the off-the-shelf
purchase of all components  from another country to that meet the
specifications to produce a domestic design.  Officials of the
Swedish companies Bofors and Hagglunds said last week that they
could produce a an MBT-2000 protoype by 1995.

ARMY TO DEVELOP FUTURISTIC BODY ARMOR FOR SOLDIERS

      The Army is looking to develop a Soldier Integrated
Protective Ensemble (SIPE) as a "head to toe" state of the art
fighting system that would improve the survivability of soldiers
in a battlefield environment.

The SIPE demonstration would culminate with the field use of the
system in the third quarter of FY '92, prior to full-scale
development.  SIPE consists of three major subsystems: Headgear,
which would provide complete head, face, neck and eye ballistic
protection, soldier-to-soldier short and long range
communication, aural protection, vision enhancement/remote weapon
sight helmet-mounted display and laser eye protection;
Microclimatic Conditioning, which is a power source that
currently does not exist, but a generator/alternator design is
being sought driven by a Stirling cycle engine; and an integrated
modular Advanced Clothing System that will comprise handwear,
footwear, load bearing equipment, and a body protective system.

The system would protect against environmental, ballistic, flame,
thermal, chemical/biological, detection and directed energy.
Approximately 12-36 prototypes are expected for field
demonstration.

AUSTRALIA BEGINS CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SUBMARINES

   Australia's new conventional submarine program is running on
schedule and on budget, with the first hull sections of the six
new vessels now being joined, Australian defense officials tell
Defense Industry Report.  Funding for procuring the new system is
$3.221 billion in current dollars.

"Construction is underway (and) most of the hardware has already
been manufactured," the official said. "Now we have the usual
challenge of putting together all of the software packages."
Other than that, he said "the program has gone along happily
meeting all milestones...It's the only one in the world that's on
time and on cost."

The first model of the conventional submarine--based on Sweden's
Kockums Type 471 series--is slated for delivery to the Royal
Australian Navy (RAN) in January 1995 to replace the current
fleet of Oberon Class subs.  The contract, awarded to the
Australian Submarine Corp. Ltd., includes options for production
of two additional vessels, plus support equipment.

LACE/UVPI/ABE & RME SET FOR FEBRUARY LAUNCH

     Four space-based experiments to be conducted for the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) are set to be launched
together from Cape Canaveral early next month aboard a McDonnell
Douglas Delta II rocket.  This mission will also be the first
commercial launch of McDac's Delta II.

The experiments are the Low-Power Atmospheric Compensation
Experiment (LACE), the Ultraviolet Plume Instrument (UVPI), the
Army Background Experiment (ABE) and the Relay Mirror Experiment
(RME).  Two of the experiments, LACE and UVPI were developed at
the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) LACE will be the 79th NRL
satellite to be launched.

The LACE experiment consists chiefly of the 1400 kg LACE
satellite and several ground stations that will be used to
determine how well the atmospheric distortion of laser beams can
be corrected.  The propagation of laser beams through the
atmosphere and the principle of thermal blooming is one of the
most difficult challenges facing directed energy weapons
research.  By being a target for lasers, LACE will measure the
work on the problem.

The satellite contains more than 200 sensors that are able to
measure laser beam intensity.  There are three different sensor
arrays to measure different types of laser emission.  They are
visible band control wave (85 sensors), infrared continuous wave
(40 sensors) and pulsed lasers that emit in the near UV, visible
and shortwave IR (85 sensors).  The LACE target array is four
meters by four meters.

The satellite will be placed in an orbit 295 nautical miles above
the Earth and, since it will pass over the Air Force Maui Optical
Station (AMOS) at least once every 24 hours, it will allow for
laser experiments to be conducted daily.
