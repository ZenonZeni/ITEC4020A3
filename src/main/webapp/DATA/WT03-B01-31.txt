North Carolina
AZOLE RESISTANCE COMMON IN AIDS PATIENTS

    Azole resistance of oropharyngeal yeasts is a common
problem in patients infected with human immunodeficiency
virus type 1, and this resistance has clinical relevance,
according to a study from North Carolina's Duke
University Medical Center.
    Candida species, particularly Candida albicans, are
important opportunistic pathogens in patients with HIV-1
infection.  Infections can range from relatively mild
oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis to severe
debilitating mucocutaneous candidiasis including Candida
esophagitis.
    "In our institution, during the past two years
Candida esophagitis has been the AIDS-defining illness in
7 percent of patients with HIV-1 infection," Miram L.
Cameron and colleagues wrote in the article, "Correlation
of In Vitro Fluconazole Resistance of Candida Isolates in
Relation to Therapy and Symptoms of Individuals
Seropositive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1,"
published in the November 1993 issue of Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy.
    "Fluconazole is used frequently for treatment and
prophylaxis of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis.
Recently we noted several patients who developed severe
oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis while receiving
azole therapy.  This finding prompted us to look for in
vitro evidence of azole, specifically fluconazole,
resistance."
    Yeast strains isolated from the oropharynx of 87
consecutive patients infected with HIV were examined for
in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole.  Candida albicans
was isolated from 73 patients.
    Fifty-one of the patients had received antifungal
therapy in the month preceding their yeast infection.
Thirty-two patients had symptomatic oropharyngeal
candidiasis.
    The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
correlated with azole use and with clinical symptoms and
signs.
    "Although there is overlap between groups, in vitro
testing identified a large group of patients for whose
yeast isolates the fluconazole MICs were high and who
remained symptomatic while receiving azole therapy,"
Cameron et al. wrote.
    "In vitro susceptibility to fluconazole appears to
correlate with clinical resistance.  Although there is
overlap between the groups in the study, the trend is
apparent, and it is likely that in vitro testing will
become a clinical tool in the management of these yeast
infections."
    Cameron et al. call for further studies, with more
patients from other institutions, to confirm their
findings.
    "There are related questions to be answered," they
noted.  "First, does azole and/or polyene therapy select
for changes in the mucosal mycoflora, such as for the
inherently resistant organisms C. krusei and T. glabrata?
Second, does azole therapy induce the development of
azole and/or polyene resistance in the mycoflora present
during its use, or is azole therapy even necessary for
resistant C. albicans to be present?
    "Finally, what is the effect of drug dosage and
length of exposure to azoles in the development of
clinical resistance?  It is essential to answer these
questions correctly to establish clinically useful in
vitro susceptibility testing for fungi and to help design
appropriate strategies for antifungal therapy and
prophylaxis."

Sweden
MECHANISTIC HETEROGENEITY RESPONSIBLE FOR DRUG
SENSITIVITY

    There appears to be a marked mechanistic
heterogeneity responsible for cytotoxic drug sensitivity
in cells with a common histologic origin exposed to the
same drug, according to a report from Uppsala, Sweden.
    In the article, "Characterization of Four Doxorubicin
Adapted Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines with Respect to
Chemotherapeutic Drug Sensitivity, Drug Resistance
Associated Membrane Proteins and Glutathione
Transferases," published in the September-October 1993
issue of Anticancer Research, researcher M. Delatorre and
colleagues examined resistance to doxorubicin.
    Four human breast cancer cell lines with or without
estrogen and progesterone receptors were adapted to
growth in the continuous presence of doxorubicin at 10
(Zr-75-1), 15 (HTB-122), or 50 (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T)
ng/ml.  The sublines of Zr-75-1, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T
showed 5-10-fold doxorubicin resistance and also cross
-resistance to vincristine (VCR) and etoposide (VP16).
    "The sublines maintained or slightly increased their
cisplatin sensitivity," the researchers wrote.  "The
sublines of HTB-122 showed resistance only to VP16
combined with a paradoxorubicinical increased sensitivity
to VCR.  The phenotypic alteration in the sublines with
respect to doxorubicin sensitivity was maintained for at
least two months in the absence of doxorubicin."
    The glutathione depletor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)
and the calcium channel blocker verapamil (Ver) increased
the doxorubicin sensitivity slightly only in the MDA-MB
-231 and Hs578T sublines, respectively.  Ver also tended
to protect some of the sublines from cisplatin.
    The sublines of Zr-75-1 and Hs578T showed increased
expression of the 170-kDa permeability glycoprotein (P
-gp), whereas expression of a 85-kDa membrane protein
determined by the MRK20 antibody was increased in the
sublines of Zr-75-1, and HTB-122.
    Class pi glutathione transferase (GST) levels varied
greatly between the cell lines but increased during
doxorubicin selection only in the subline of Zr-75-1.
Class mu GST was detectable in the MDA-MB-231, Hs578T and
HTB-122 cell lines, whereas class alpha GST was
detectable in these sublines but undetectable in their
parental cell lines.  The Zr-75-1 subline showed a 5-fold
increase in the class alpha concentration.
    "Except for a correlation between increased P-gp
expression and resistance to doxorubicin, VCR and VP16,
no obvious correlations between receptor status,
increased P-gp expression, membrane proteins, GST levels
and acquired drug resistance were found," Delatorre et
al. wrote.
    "Thus, except for a possible role for P-gp in
multidrug-resistance, these findings indicate a
pronounced mechanistic heterogeneity responsible for
cytotoxic drug sensitivity also in cells with a common
histologic origin and exposed to the same drug."

OVEREXPRESSION OF MDR-PROTEIN PRESENT IN RESISTANT LUNG
CANCER CELL LINE

    The overexpression of multidrug resistance-associated
protein is accompanied by increase in both K(+) channel
and volume-regulated C1(-) channel current in the
multidrug-resistant small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell
line H69AR.
    "The coexistence of markedly elevated K(+) and C1(-)
channels in the H69AR cells suggests that solute export
from these cells may differ significantly from the
parental and revertant cell lines," researcher J. Jirsch
and colleagues wrote in the article, "Inwardly Rectifying
K+ Channels and Volume-Regulated Anion Channels in
Multidrug-resistant Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells,"
published in the September 15, 1993, issue of Cancer
Research.
    "Experiments are in progress to determine whether
modulation of the activity of these channels has any
bearing on the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs in multidrug
-resistant cells which overexpress multidrug resistance
-associated protein (MRP)."
    The multidrug-resistant SCLC cell line H69AR was
derived from its parental cell line, H69 by stepwise
selection in doxorubicin.  H69AR cells display a drug
cross-resistance pattern very similar to that of cells
overexpressing P-glycoprotein, but levels of P
-glycoprotein in H69AR cells are extremely low and
comparable with those found in parental H69 cells.
    "Multidrug resistance in H69AR cells has recently
been shown to be correlated with approximately a 100-fold
increase in the levels of mRNA encoding a novel member of
the ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporter
superfamily," Jirsch et al. wrote.  "The physiological
function of this multidrug resistance-associated protein,
MPR, and the mechanism by which it may contribute to drug
resistance are currently unknown."
    Studies of multidrug-resistant H69AR cells which
overexpress the multidrug resistance-associated protein,
compared with drug-sensitive parental H69 cells and
reverant H69Pr cells, revealed an inwardly rectifying
K(+) channel current (conductance, 231 pS/pF) and
increased volume-regulated anion current (limiting
conductance, 2 nS/pF).
    "The anion current was selective for C1(-) ions and
sensitive to 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic
acid (0.1-1 mM) but ATP was not required for initial
current activation even in excised patch experiments,"
Jirsch et al. wrote.
    "K(+) current reversal potential varied 52 mV/10-fold
change in the external K(+) concentration and current was
blocked by BaC1(2) (0.1-1mM).  The results indicate that
overexpression of multidrug resistance-associated protein
is accompanied by increase in both K(+) channel and
volume-regulated C1(-) channel current in the multidrug
-resistant cell line H69AR."

NIFEDIPINE MAY ALTER DRUG RESISTANCE IN MALARIA

    The calcium channel blocker (CCB) nifedipine may be
useful in combination with chloroquine for the treatment
of chloroquine-resistant malaria, but more study is
needed.
    Researchers from Chandigarh, India's Postgraduate
Institute of Medical Education and Research examined the
effect of nifedipine on the course of Plasmodium berghei
infection.
    "Recent reports point to a class of compounds, namely
CCBs, as being able to reverse such chloroquine
resistance by decreasing drug efflux from the cells,"
researcher Anju Kalra and colleagues wrote in the
article, "Altered Course of Plasmodium-berghei Infection
by Nifedipine Treatment," published in the September 1993
issue of APMIS.
    "Circumvention of drug resistance by verapamil and
nifedipine has also been reported in vivo in P.
chalbaudi-infected mice," Kalra et al.. wrote.  "These
workers have shown that calcium antagonists by themselves
do not have any inhibitory effect on the parasite and are
effective only when administered along with chloroquine,
both in chloroquine-sensitive as well as chloroquine
-resistant strains."
    The effect of CCB on the course and severity of
plasmodial infection has not been studied extensively.
    "This is necessary before considering the use of CCB
in combination with chloroquine for chemotherapy or
chemoprophylaxis of chloroquine-resistant malaria," the
researchers wrote.  "Keeping this in view, the present
study was undertaken to investigate different aspects of
the course of P. berghei infection in Swiss Albino mice
following nifedipine treatment."
    The researchers observed that mice receiving a daily
dose of 0.015 mg/kg of nifedipine had significantly
shorter prepatent, patent and survival periods compared
to untreated P. berghei-infected animals (P <0.001).
    "This shows that the calcium channel blockers, in
addition to possessing the property of reversing drug
resistance during combined therapy with chloroquine, may
also alter the pathophysiology of malaria infection,"
they wrote.
    Kalra et al. note that long-term therapy with
nifedipine, as shown in their study, is of interest with
respect to two epidemiological and chemotherapeutic
aspects of malaria.
    "Firstly, even though during short-term treatment of
an acute malaria attack the use of CCB drugs along with
chloroquine may not noticeably alter the host response,
it becomes important if CCB are used in prolonged
prophylactic therapy," they wrote.
    "Secondly, the calcium antagonist drugs are already
being widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular
disorders.  The effect of CCB on the severity and course
of malaria infection in patients on long-term calcium
antagonist drug therapy has not been studied.  Similarly
the long-term effects in patients receiving CCB for
circulatory disorders and chloroquine for malaria
prophylaxis are not known.  If these CCB drugs are to be
used in combination with prophylactic doses of
chloroquine in areas with a high incidence of chloroquine
resistance, their possible action on the general immune
status of the human host must be investigated before
initiating such a chemotherapeutic approach."

United Kingdom
CHLOROQUINE-RESISTANCE IN MALARIA PATIENTS MAY BE
OVERCOME

    Studies with agents such as verapamil suggest that it
may be possible to enhance chloroquine sensitivity in
malaria patients, according to a study from the
University of Liverpool.
    Resistance to quinoline containing drugs,
particularly chloroquine (CQ), is a major impediment to
the successful chemotherapy and prophylaxis of malaria.
CQ-resistant parasites fail to accumulate as much drug as
their sensitive counterparts, but the reason for this
phenomenon has not been determined.
    "There are at least two principal forms of drug
resistance in malaria," researchers Patrick Bray and
Stephen Ward wrote in the article, "Malaria Chemotherapy:
Resistance to Quinoline Containing Drugs in Plasmodium
falciparum," published in the October 1, 1993, issue of
FEMS Microbiology Letters.
    "First, resistance to the inhibitors of parasite
folate metabolism, which results from specific single
point mutations of the active site (the dihydrofolate
reductase molecule).  This form of resistance arose soon
after introduction of the antifolate drugs and spread
independently from many different foci.  Second,
resistance to chloroquine, which is thought likely to
involve more than one gene, took much longer to develop
and spread from only two foci.  The chloroquine
resistance mechanism, which forms the basis of this
review, has been intensively investigated and whilst not
fully elucidated, probably involves alterations in drug
transport rather than changes at the site of drug
action."
    Bray et al. suggest that CQ-resistant parasites are
believed to maintain lower intracellular drug levels by
means of an active efflux system, similar to that found
in multidrug resistant cancer cells, despite major
differences in both the genetic and biochemical
manifestations of drug resistance in the two cell types.
    Another theory suggests that CQ-resistance could be
linked to a defective CQ uptake mechanism, possibly an
impaired acidification process in the food vacuole of the
resistant parasite.
    "In our opinion, the rate of chloroquine efflux can
no longer be considered to be a reliable phenotypic
indicator of resistance, although the ability of
verapamil to increase steady-state chloroquine
concentrations (albeit at low extracellular chloroquine
concentrations) was found to be specific to resistant
strains," Bray et al. wrote.
    "We believe that chloroquine resistance cannot be
explained simply in terms of enhanced chloroquine efflux
(although efflux is certainly one of the factors
involved), and further, that the reversal of chloroquine
resistance cannot be explained simply by the global
inhibition of drug efflux."
    Despite the fact that the molecular basis of
chloroquine sensitization is poorly characterized in P.
falciparum, the prospect remains that by careful
selection of chemosensitizer it may be possible to
enhance chloroquine sensitivity in vivo, according to
Bray and Ward.
    "Regrettably, because of the unacceptable
pharmacological properties of known enhancers and their
loss of effect both in vitro and in vivo due to plasma
protein binding, none of the currently identified
enhancers is a suitable candidate," they wrote.
    "Studies which provide an improved understanding of
the resistance mechanism(s) evolved by the parasite could
highlight the sites at which pharmacological intervention
may reverse drug resistance.  Such studies may also
provide information that can be applied to the rational
design and use of future antimalarials, so that drug
resistance is less readily developed by the parasite."

NEW MYELOID CELL LINES USEFUL IN EXAMINING MDR1 GENE

    Two newly identified myeloid cell lines, K051 and
K052, may be useful for investigating the cellular and
molecular events in leukemogenesis and drug resistance,
according to a report from a Japanese research center.
    The two cell lines were established from a patient
with multilineage CD7-positive acute leukemia.  The K051
and K052 lines were taken from the patient's bone-marrow
cells at diagnosis and at relapse, respectively.
    "The K051 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigen
(CD13 and CD33), a platelet-associated antigen (CD41),
and an erythroid antigen (glycophorin A)," researcher
Junko Abo and colleagues reported in the article, "p53
and N-ras Mutations in Two New Leukemia Cell Lines
Established from a Patient with Multilineage CD7-Positive
Acute Leukemia," published in the November 1, 1993, issue
of Blood.
    "The K052 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigens
(CD13, CD14 and CD33), lymphoid markers (CD2, CD5 and
CD7), and HLA-DR," Abo et al. wrote.  "Chromosome
analysis of both cell lines showed a 17p-chromosome."
    Both cell lines were investigated for aberrations of
the p53 gene and the N-ras gene.  A p53 mutation detected
in both cell lines consisted of a C to T substitution in
codon 248.  An N-ras mutation detected only in the K052
cell consisted of a G to C substitution in codon 13.
    Expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1)
was also investigated by the semiquantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  MDR1
mRNA was more highly expressed by the K052 cell than the
K051 cell, being equivalent to that in HEL cells.
    The functional MDR1 protein against vincristine was
also observed, and its function was inhibited by
verapamil and cyclosporin A.
    "The K052 cells were capable of phenotypic or
morphologic differentiation after being incubated with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2,

GST RELATED TO MDR IN CANCER CELL LINES

    Increased glutathione S-transferase (GST) has been
found to be involved in the drug resistance mechanism in
a human cancer cell line, suggesting that GST over
-expression is directly related to drug resistance.
    GST enzymes are often over-expressed in tumor cells
made resistant to cytotoxic drugs, but it has been
unclear whether GST over-expression is directly linked to
the resistance mechanism.
    Researcher Clare J. Wareing and colleagues at a
Scottish research center developed a human lung tumor
cell line resistant to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB)
in an effort to establish whether selection for
resistance with a model GST substrate results in
selection of a cell line with higher GST levels.
    "The GST are represented by several gene families,
termed alpha, mu, pi, theta and microsomal, each of which
detoxify harmful electrophiles by catalyzing their
conjugation with glutathione," Wareing et al. wrote in
the article, "Increased Levels of alpha-Class and pi
-Class GST in Cell Lines Resistant to CDNB," published in
the October 1993 issue of European Journal of
Biochemistry.
    "In addition to the increases in GST in drug
-resistant cell lines, other evidence implicating these
enzymes in resistance includes the findings that GST
catalyze the conjunction of anticancer drugs such as
chlorambucil and melphalan with reduced glutathione, that
alpha class GST genes are amplified in a cell line made
resistant to chlorambucil and that the expression of GST
cDNAs in heterologous systems can lead to drug
resistance."
    Wareing et al. found that the resistant line of CDNB
(CDNBr), although only twofold more resistant to the
compound, exhibited a significant (15-fold) increase in
GST activity compared to the wild-type cell line.
    "Resistance to CDNB was associated with a marked
increase in the level of both alpha-class and pi-class
GST," the researchers wrote.
    "The increased levels of alpha-class and pi-class GST
in the CDNBr cells was not due to either gene
amplification or increased mRNA levels and appears to
involve either altered mRNA utilization or protein
stabilization.  In addition to being resistant to CDNB,
the CDNBr cell line also showed a 2.5-fold resistance to
cumene hydroperoxide but was not cross-resistant to the
anticancer drug chlorambucil."
    "The fact that the CDNB-resistant cell line was
cross-resistant to cumene hydroperoxide is consistent
with the ability of alpha-class GST to reduce organic
hydroperoxides," the researchers wrote.  "However, it was
surprising that the resistant line was sensitive to
chlorambucil.  There is strong evidence from the study of
chlorambucil-resistant cell lines and from gene-transfer
experiments that the GST have the capacity to protect
against the toxic effects of this compound.
    "The reason why no cross-resistance to chlorambucil
was observed in the CDNBr cell line is unclear and
suggests that a number of interacting factors are needed
to generate the drug-resistance phenotype."

MDR ASSOCIATED WITH GLYCOPROTEIN IN AML PATIENTS

    An Italian study of multidrug resistance (MDR) in
acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients has confirmed
that in at least two patients blasts previously negative
for the glycoprotein P-170 became P-170 positive after
treatment with low-dose arabinosylcytosine (ARA-C) and
vitamin D(3).
    Researcher Mario Petrini and colleagues report
preliminary results from a pilot study begun in 1986 on
patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia treated for
several months with low-dose ARA-C and vitamin D(3).
During treatment or at the time of relapse, a monoblastic
component was frequently found.  A high percentage of
patients were P-170 positive.
    In the two cases of drug-resistance presented in
detail by Petrini et al. conversion of blasts from P-170
negative before ARA-C/vitamin D(3) treatment to P-170
positive after treatment was significant in failure of
clinical response to the agents.
    "The reported cases raise several issues about the
role of low doses of ARA-C, the monoblastic shift of
leukemias during vitamin D(3) administration, the
development of MDR and a possible therapeutic role of
calcium antagonists," Petrini et al. wrote in the
article, "Vitamin D(3) Administration and Multidrug
Resistance in Acute Nonlymphoblastic Leukemia," published
in the 1993 89(4) issue of Acta Haematologica.
    "The addition of the revertant drug nicardipine to
the previously inactive treatment induced a partial
response.  Thus, previously reported in vitro
observations on the differentiating activity of vitamin
D(3) metabolites, possible induction of multidrug
chemoresistance by differentiating agents and the
revertant activity of Ca(++) antagonist nicardipine
appear to be confirmed in vivo in the reported patients."

PHENOXAZINE MODULATORS MAY HAVE TWO OR MORE MECHANISMS OF
ACTION

    At least part of the activity of some N-substituted
phenoxazine modulators may be mediated through a P
-glycoprotein-independent mechanism, according to a
report from Memphis, Tennessee's St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital.
    In previous studies Julie K. Horton and colleagues
reported the synthesis and partial characterization of 21
N(10)-substituted phenoxazines in reversing resistance to
the Vinca alkaloids.
    "To more fully understand the mechanisms for
modulating multidrug resistance (MDR), we have
synthesized a series of phenoxazine derivatives, based
upon our initial observation that phenoxazine, where the
5-position sulfur of phenothiazine is replaced by an
oxygen atom, was a more effective modulator of Vinca
alkaloid accumulation than was phenothiazine," Horton et
al. wrote in the article, "Pharmacological
Characterization of N-Substituted Phenoxazines Directed
toward Reversing Vinca Alkaloid Resistance in Multidrug
-Resistant Cancer Cells," published in the October 1993
issue of Physiological Reviews.
    The researchers compared the activity of the 21
N(10)-substituted phenoxazines in increasing Vinca
alkaloid accumulation and reversing drug resistance in
two human colon carcinoma cell lines.
    Results demonstrated that N-substituted phenoxazines
increased accumulation of vinblastine and that, within
this series, there was little correlation between the two
cell lines when Vinca alkaloid accumulation was compared
at equal concentrations of modulator.  It was also shown
that N-substituted phenoxazines demonstrated both
quantitative and qualitative differences, compared with
verapamil.  The series included at least two compounds,
10-[3'-[N-bis(hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxazine and
10-(N-piperidinoacetyl)phenoxazine, which increase Vinca
alkaloid accumulation but do not significantly inhibit
efflux.
    Several of the MDR modulators significantly enhanced
the accumulation (8-50-fold) of Vinca alkaloids in cell
lines with very low or undetectable P-glycoprotein
levels.
    "The studies presented here suggest that within the
series there are compounds that inhibit efflux
(verapamil-like activity), whereas others markedly
increase Vinca alkaloid accumulation without having
significant detectable inhibitory activity on the efflux
component," Horton et al. wrote.  "Several of the
phenoxazine modulators characterized enhance Vinca
alkaloid accumulation in cell lines where verapamil has
no significant activity.  Data support the concept that
influx of Vinca alkaloids may be enhanced in a P
-glycoprotein-independent manner by several N-substituted
phenoxazines."

JSB-1 NOT PREDICTIVE OF THERAPY RESPONSE IN AML

    The assessment of multidrug resistant (MDR) status by
immunocytochemistry using JSB-1 monoclonal antibody is
not predictive of response to chemotherapy in patients
with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), according to a report
from Great Britain.
    Forty one patients with AML, including 27 at
presentation and 14 relapsed or resistant cases, were
assessed for laboratory evidence of the MDR phenotype by
researcher A.B. Mehta and colleagues from London's Royal
Free Hospital.  The study was reported in the October
1993 issue of Leukemia and Lymphoma.
    Leukemic cells from all 41 cases were studied by
immunocytochemistry using the JSB-1 monoclonal antibody
and simultaneously by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) to evaluate expression of the MDR
1 gene.  Cells from 32 of the 41 cases were also assessed
for daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation and retention by flow
cytometry (FC).
    Nineteen of the 41 (46 percent) patients were
positive for MDR by JSB-1 immunocytochemistry (11 of 27
at presentation and eight of 14 relapsed or resistant
cases).  Nine of the 19 (47 percent) P-gp positive, de
novo patients achieved complete remission.
    Twenty-two patients were negative by JSB-1
immunocytochemistry (16 of 27 at presentation and six of
14 of the relapsed or resistant cases) and 11 of 22 (50
percent) P-gp negative patients achieved a complete
remission.
    Of the 32 patients assessed by FC, seven (22 percent)
were positive for the MDR phenotype with increased DNR
accumulation and retention in the presence of the MDR
reversing agent verapamil (VPM).  Six out of seven of the
FC positive cases were also JSB-1 positive, and six had
additional poor risk features.
    Of the 25 FC negative patients, six had received
previous chemotherapy and 15 (60 percent) achieved
complete remission.  MDR 1 mRNA levels were increased in
all seven FC positive cases whereas only seven of 19 JSB
-1 positive cases had raised MDR 1 mRNA levels.
    "These results suggest that the assessment of MDR
status by immunocytochemistry using JSB-1 is not
predictive of response to chemotherapy," the authors
conclude.
    "Flow cytometric analysis of blast cells appears to
correlate well with MDR 1 mRNA levels and may be a better
predictor of treatment outcome."

PROGESTERONE CRUCIAL TO BINDING OF RHODAMINE 123

    Progesterone appears to act by a non-genomic
mechanism to decease intracellular binding of rhodamine
123, making the dye accessible to the multidrug
resistance (MDR) pump, according to a report from the
Yale University Comprehensive Cancer Center.
    Rhodamine 123 is a mitochondrial dye that is retained
for prolonged periods by carcinoma cells.  In previous
studies it was reported that many transformed epithelial
cell lines and carcinoma-derived cell lines retain the
dye much longer than do normal epithelial cells.
    An important factor that decreases rhodamine 123
retention in cells is the MDR pump.  It has been widely
reported that resistance to cancer chemotherapy may be
caused by a pump that removes drugs from cells, and that
effective substrates for the pump are lipophilic and
cationic.  Compounds with these characteristics, such as
verapamil, directly interact with the pump to inhibit
transport of other substrates.
    "Rhodamine 123 is a good substrate for the pump, as
would be predicted by its structure; retention of this
dye has been suggested to be an assay for the presence of
the MDR pump in resistant cancer cells," researcher Erik
M. Jancis and colleagues wrote in the article, "Rapid
Stimulation of Rhodamine 123 Efflux From Multidrug
-Resistant KB Cells By Progesterone," published in the
November 2, 1993, issue of Biochemical Pharmacology.
    "In the course of analyzing the factors that
contribute to prolonged rhodamine 123 retention in
carcinoma cells, we found that progesterone did not
always inhibit efflux of rhodamine 123 from KB cells
selected for multidrug resistance," the researchers
wrote.
    "While investigating causes of retention of this dye,
we found that 10 uM progesterone caused a rapid
stimulation of efflux of rhodamine 123 within 15 minutes
from KB V20C cells, which overexpress the multidrug
resistance pump."
    Progesterone did not stimulate efflux from KB cells
that do not overexpress the pump, and verapamil blocked
rhodamine 123 efflux in the presence or absence of
progesterone, indicating that rhodamine 123 is removed
from KB V20C cells by the MDR pump.
    "Progesterone, however, is unlikely to stimulate
rhodamine 123 efflux by simply increasing pump activity
for two reasons:  (1) progesterone inhibited the efflux
of daunomycin from KB V20C cells, so it did not stimulate
efflux of all drugs, and (2) progesterone inhibited
efflux of rhodamine 123 from L1210/VMDRC cells and had
little effect on Adr(R) MCF7 cells; both overexpress the
multidrug resistance pump," Jancis et al. reported.
    In the experiments with KB V20C cells, progesterone
was the most active steroid tested.  At 10 uM,
progesterone caused a 70-fold stimulation,
desoxycorticosterone, testosterone, promegestone and
estradiol caused about 20-fold stimulation, and others
had little or no effect.
    "Progesterone may act by a non-genomic mechanism to
decrease intracellular binding of rhodamine 123, making
the dye accessible to the multidrug resistance pump," the
authors concluded.
    "The results of this paper demonstrate that retention
of rhodamine 123 is rapidly changed by factors other than
the simple overall activity of the multidrug resistance
pump and so the interpretation of retention is more
complex that simply reflecting the amount of the
multidrug resistance pump.  Determining how progesterone
influences rhodamine 123 retention will not only lead to
a greater understanding of why this dye is retained so
well by carcinoma cells but also may lead to new
knowledge of progesterone actions."

HEPT-DERIVATIVES ACTIVE AGAINST RESISTANT HIV STRAINS

    1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine
(HEPT) derivatives retain significant activity against
human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) mutant strains that
are resistant to other HIV-1-specific inhibitors,
according to a report from a Belgian research center.
    Several classes of structurally different compounds
have been credited with a highly specific activity
against HIV-1.  These compounds are not inhibitory to any
DNA or RNA viruses other than HIV-1.
    "The HEPT derivatives have not been analyzed for
their resistance to HIV-1 mutant strains that were
selected for resistance to the other classes of HIV-1
-specific inhibitors and contain a well defined amino
acid substitution in their reverse transcriptase (RT)
genome," researcher Jan Balzarini and colleagues wrote in
the article, "HIV-1 Drug-Resistance Patterns with
Different HEPT Derivatives," published in the October
1993 issue of Molecular Pharmacology.
    "Nor has the emergence of drug-resistant virus under
HEPT therapy been investigated.  In the present study, we
found that HEPT derivates in general remain inhibitory to
HIV-1 strains selected for resistance to various other
classes of HIV-1-specific inhibitors."
    The researchers also found that HIV-1 mutant strains
selected for resistance to various other classes of HEPT
derivatives show cross-resistance to virtually all of
other HIV-1-specific inhibitors.  Different HEPT
derivatives were also found to select for different
mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene.
    "When directly selected for resistance to the HEPT
derivates, the HIV-1 mutant strains are resistant not
only to the HEPT derivatives but also to the other HIV-1
-specific RT inhibitors," Balzarini et al. wrote.
    "From a clinical viewpoint, our observations suggest
that the HEPT derivatives may be beneficial in the
treatment of those HIV-1 infections that have become
resistant to other HIV-1-specific inhibitors."

The Netherlands
CISPLATIN-RESISTANT CELL LINE, TERA-CP, IDENTIFIED

    Researchers from the Netherlands describe a
cisplatin-resistant embryonal carcinoma cell line of
teratocarcinoma with the capacity to differentiate in
vitro.
    Teratocarcinoma is the most common form of cancer in
young adult men, consisting of two histological
components, embryonal carcinoma (EC) and teratoma.  EC
cells are the stem cells from which the teratoma
component is derived.  EC is highly malignant with a
tendency to early metastatic spread, but also responds
well to therapy with cisplatin.
    Resistance to cisplatin can be due to reduced drug
accumulation and increased detoxification of drug in the
cellular cytoplasm, but mechanisms of resistance are not
uniform and vary among different cell lines.
    In this study researcher Hetty Timmer-Bosscha and
colleagues describe the Tera-CP subline, which enables
the study of cisplatin-resistance in extremely sensitive
cells and the effect of serial cisplatin incubations on
the EC phenotype of the cells.
    "In the embryonal carcinoma cell line Tera and its
3.7-fold cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin)
-resistant subline, Tera-CP, parameters were studied that
might have changed in relation to induction of cisplatin
resistance," Timmer-Bosscha et al. wrote in the article,
"cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) Resistance In Vitro and
In Vivo in Human Embryonal Carcinoma Cells," published in
the December 1, 1993, issue of Cancer Research.
    "Phenotypes of both lines were embryonal carcinoma.
Karyotypes were related with a decreased mean number of
chromosomes and fewer copies of the short arm of
chromosome 12 in Tera-CP."
    Tera-CP showed cross-resistance for melphalan and 4
-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and had an 1.4-fold
increased glutathione (GSH) level, a 1.5-fold increased
glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, and a 1.4-fold
increased GSTpi expression compared to Tera.
    Tera-CP was cross-resistant to 5-fluorouracil, but
thymidylate synthase activity was not increased.
Topoisomerase I and II activities and c-myc RNA and
protein expression were the same in both lines.
    Platinum accumulation was equal in both lines, and
platinum-DNA binding was lower in Tera-CP than in Tera.
Both cell lines were xenografted into nude mice and
tumors showed marked differentiation.
    Tera-CP tumors were 2.8-fold more resistant to
cisplatin than Tera tumors.  In new cell lines derived
from xenografts of Tera and Tera-CP cisplatin
sensitivity, GST activity and GSH level corresponded with
their sensitivity and resistant origin.
    "Tera-CP is a model of in vitro and in vivo cisplatin
resistance with the GSH/GST detoxifying system as an
important mechanism," the researchers wrote.  "Cisplatin
resistance could be induced without a concomitant
increase in differentiation."

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN P. AERUGINOSA DUE TO ORFC
-DEPENDENT DRUG EFFLUX

    ORFC-dependent drug efflux contributes to multiple
antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
according to a report from Ontario, Canada's Queen's
University.
    P. aeruginosa is a clinically significant pathogen
characterized by intrinsic resistance to a number of
antimicrobial agents.
    Recently researcher Keith Poole and colleagues
identified an operon (ORFABC) in P. aeruginosa apparently
involved in pyoverdine secretion.
    "We report here the characterization of ORFC, which
encodes an outer membrane protein whose overproduction is
associated with multiple antibiotic resistance," Poole et
al. wrote in the article, "Multiple Antibiotic Resistance
in Pseudomonas-aeruginosa - Evidence for Involvement of
an Efflux Operon," published in the November 1993 issue
of Journal of Bacteriology.
    An outer membrane protein of 50 kDa (OprK) was
overproduced in a siderophore-deficient mutant of P.
aeruginosa capable of growth on iron-deficient minimal
medium containing 2,2'-dipyridyl (0.5 mM).
    "The expression of OprK in the mutant (strain K385)
was associated with enhanced resistance to a number of
antimicrobial agents, including ciprofloxacin, nalidixic
acid, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptonigrin.
OprK was inducible in the parent strain by growth under
severe iron limitation, as provided, for example, by the
addition of dipyridyl or ZnSO4 to the growth medium,"
Poole et al. wrote.
    "The gene encoding OprK (previously identified as
ORFC) forms part of an operon composed of three genes
(ORFABC) implicated in the secretion of the siderophore
pyoverdine.  Mutants defective in ORFA, ORFB or ORFC
exhibited enhanced susceptibility to tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, streptonigrin and
dipyridyl, consistent with a role for the ORFABC operon
in multiple antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa."
    Sequence analysis of ORFC revealed that its product
is homologous to a class of outer membrane proteins
involved in export.  Similarly, the products of ORFA and
ORFB exhibit homology to previously described bacterial
export proteins located in the cytoplasmic membrane.
    "These data suggest that ORFA-ORFB-oprK (ORFC)
-dependent drug efflux contributes to multiple antibiotic
resistance in P. aeruginosa," the authors noted.  "We
propose, therefore, the designation mexAB (multiple
efflux) for ORFAB."

TLB EFFICACIOUS IN CISPLATIN-RESISTANCE

    Thaliblastine may be of value in the treatment of
cisplatin-resistant malignancies with hyperthermia,
according to a report from Boston's Harvard University.
    Researcher G. Chen and colleagues examined
thaliblastine (TBL), a natural compound, in a murine
study examining a cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor cell
line.
    "TBL showed a twofold higher cytotoxicity in a
cisplatin-resistant rat ovarian tumor cell line (0
-342/cisplatin) than in its parental sensitive line (0
-342), as determined by an antiproliferation assay with
24-hour continuous exposure," Chen et al. wrote in the
article, "Collateral Sensitivity to Thaliblastine and/or
Hyperthermia Exhibited by a Rat Ovarian Tumor Cell Line
Selected for Resistance to Cisplatin," published in the
September-October 1993 issue of Anticancer Research.
    This phenomenon was also observed following two-hour
pulse exposure if combined with heat treatment (40deg.C).
Further escalation of the temperature to 43deg.C alone
brought about 74.7 +/- 17.0 percent growth inhibition in
the sensitive and 97.2 +/- 1.8 percent in the resistant
line.
    "Under this condition, the ID50 of TBL was again only
half as much in 0-342/cisplatin cells as in the parental
cells (12 vs 24 mug/ml) when compared to the hyperthermic
treatment alone," Chen et al. wrote.  "In a colony
formation assay with two-hour pulse exposure, the
hypersensitivity of the resistant cells to cisplatin
and/or heat was further confirmed."
    Alkaline elution showed that 24-hour continuous
treatment with TBL induced DNA single-strand breaks (SSB)
in a dose-dependent manner in 0-342/cisplatin cells,
whereas there was almost no DNA-SSB production by TBL in
the sensitive line, possibly in part accounting for the
hypersensitivity of the cisplatin resistant cells to TBL.
    The heat treatment (40deg.C for two hours) induced
single strand breaks in both lines, which was further
enhanced by combination with TBL.
    This damage was repaired in part in 0-342 but almost
completely in 0-342/cisplatin line after cells grew in
drug-free medium for 48 hours following the exposure,
indicating that resistant cells can more efficiently
repair DNA damage by either TBL or hyperthermia.
    "Altogether, these results suggest that TBL may have
the potential to be used clinically as an alternative in
the treatment of cisplatin-resistant malignancies with
hyperthermia," the authors concluded.

PODOPHYLLOTOXIN ANALOGS MAY BE USEFUL IN DR TUMORS

    Podophyllotoxin analogs can overcome resistance to
etoposide and may be of value in the treatment of drug
-resistant (DR) tumors, according to a report from the
University of California, Los Angeles.
    Researcher H. Morimoto and colleagues described two
podophyllotoxin analogs in their article, "Cytotoxic
Activity Against Resistant Human Tumor Cell Lines by Two
Synthetic Demethylpodophyllotoxin Derivatives - A Single
Stereoisomeric Change Prevents Cell Death by Apoptosis,"
published in the December 1993 issue of the International
Journal of Oncology.
    "The present study investigated the cytotoxic
properties of two synthetic podophyllotoxin derivatives
namely 4-o-butanoyl-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin (BEPT)
and 4-o-butanoyl-4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin (BDPTN or
BN58705)," Morimoto et al. wrote.
    Both BEPT and BDPTN were shown to be cytotoxic
against a battery of human tumor cell lines.
    "In comparison to etoposide, the magnitude of
cytotoxic activity by BEPT and BDPTN was higher," the
researchers wrote.  "Furthermore, both compounds were
cytotoxic to drug resistant lines and also were able to
overcome the etoposide and cross-resistance of an MDR
positive cell line."
    The mechanism of cytotoxicity was also examined.
Like etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and inducer
of apoptosis, BEPT was found to mediate its cytotoxic
activity by an apoptotic pathway.  BDPTN, however, did
not mediate apoptosis.
    "These findings demonstrate that a simple
modification in the stereoisomeric structure results in
significant modification in both the cytotoxic patterns
and the induction of apoptosis," Morimoto et al. wrote.
"Furthermore, the findings show that the podophyllotoxin
analogs can overcome drug resistance and suggest their
possible application in the therapy of resistant tumors."

CEFPIROME EFFECTIVE AGAINST BACTERIA RESISTANT TO OTHER
BETA-LACTAMS

    A report from England finds that cefpirome has a
potential clinical advantage against gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria resistant to other beta-lactams,
including imipenem.
    Researcher R.C. Spencer and colleagues examined
several beta-lactams in a multicenter in vitro study
involving 8,625 isolates from 13 countries, in an effort
to determine both the current bacterial epidemiology in
intensive care and hematology/oncology units and the
cross-susceptibility of the organisms to cefpirome,
ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and piperacillin.  The
specimens were examined between May and November of 1992.
    "Bacterial species with 20 or more isolates resistant
to one of the six antibiotics were examined for their
susceptibility to the beta-lactams," Spencer et al. wrote
in the article, "Cross-Susceptibility of Cefpirome and
Four Other beta-Lactams Against Isolates from Hematology
Oncology and Intensive Care Units," published in the
Supplement 91, 1993 issue of Scandinavian Journal of
Infectious Diseases.
    Cefpirome and imipenem had the smallest total numbers
of isolates.  Bacteria resistant to ceftazidime or
ceftriaxone were often susceptible (>50 percent) to
cefpirome.  Conversely, cefpirome resistant isolates were
frequently resistant (>90 percent) to ceftazidime and
ceftriaxone.  P. aeruginosa was an exception, exhibiting
cross-resistance to all cephalosporins.
    Beta-lactamase producing Enterobacter, Citrobacter
and Klebsiella spp. were especially resistant to
piperacillin and ceftazidime but not cefpirome or
imipenem.  Two-thirds or more of coagulase-negative
staphylococci resistant to any single agent, including
imipenem, maintained their susceptibility to cefpirome.
    Cross-class resistance was not exhibited by imipenem
and cefpirome against ciprofloxacin resistant isolates
but was more evident for piperacillin, ceftazidime and
ceftriaxone.  Cefpirome was more active than ceftazidime
against bacteria resistant to both piperacillin and
gentamicin, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci
(76 percent versus 6 percent) and Enterobacter spp. (56
percent versus 21 percent).
    Many coagulase-negative staphylococci and
Enterobacter spp. resistant to two or three compounds
(piperacillin, gentamicin, ceftazidime) remained
susceptible to cefpirome (50-89 percent).
    "These results suggest that cefpirome has a potential
clinical advantage against gram-positive and gram
-negative bacteria resistant to other beta-lactams,
including imipenem," Spencer et al. conclude.

VERAPAMIL ENHANCES ACTIVITY OF SLEEPING-SICKNESS DRUGS IN
MICE

    The calcium channel blocker verapamil was shown to
enhance the efficacy of drug response in mice infected
with human sleeping sickness strains of Trypanosoma
brucei brucei, but it showed no effect when given alone.
    Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch
at Galveston found that enhancement by verapamil of the
anti-trypansomal effects of ethidium were reflected in
accelerated clearing of the parasites from the blood, and
by the increased production, in the treatment schedule,
of dyskinetoplastic organisms.
    K. Lemone Yielding and colleagues concomitantly
administered verapamil during treatment for two different
strains of the parasite with the anti-trypanosomiasis
agents ethidium bromide or berenil.  This resulted in
enhancement of the drug effect as shown by increased
formation of dyskinetoplastic organisms, increased rates
of clearing of the parasites from the blood, and by
enhanced survival of infected mice.
    Verapamil treatment was associated with increased
intracellular accumulation of drug, as shown by
fluorescence of cells exposed to ethidium or DAPI, a
fluorescent surrogate for berenil.
    "In keeping with the reported involvement of
verapamil in preventing efflux of drugs from cells,
ethidium bromide accumulation in intact trypanosomes was
monitored by fluorescence in the presence and absence of
verapamil, and was reflected by detectable fluorescence
in treated cells at ethidium concentrations only 1/10 of
those required for detection in the controls," Yielding
et al. wrote in the article, "Effect of Verapamil on
Antitrypanosomal Activity of Drugs in Mice," published in
the October 1993 issue of Acta Tropica.
    "These results suggest that verapamil can enhance
drug accumulation in trypanosomes as it does in drug
resistant cancer cells and in chloroquine-resistant
malaria.  For trypanosomes the data do not permit
assignment of the effect to either efflux or influx,
however.  The findings in the present experiments suggest
that a verapamil sensitive gene product which can
influence drug response is expressed constitutively in
trypanosomes."
    The authors conclude that if, as implied by these
results, parasites express drug-resistance genes
constitutively, "the search for new drug strategies must
include manipulation of these resistance mechanisms in
concert with the application of new antiparasitic
agents."

INHIBITION OF DIGOXIN TRANSPORT IN VERAPAMIL NON
-STEREOSPECIFIC

    The inhibition of digoxin transport by verapamil
appears to be non-stereospecific, according to a report
from a Canadian research center.
    Verapamil, usually given as a racemic mixture,
decreases in vivo and in vitro digoxin renal tubular
secretion, which is suggested to be mediated by P
-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent multidrug efflux pump.
    "Importantly, the two enantiomers of verapamil have
been reported to similarly inhibit P-glycoprotein
-mediated transport of chemotherapeutic agents,
researcher S. Ito and colleagues wrote in the article,
"The Mechanism of the Verapamil-Digoxin Interaction in
Renal Tubular Cells (LLC-PK1)," published in the Volume
53, Number 24, 1993 issue of Life Sciences.
    "In this study, we examined effects of enantiomers of
verapamil on digoxin transport across an LLC-PK1 cell
monolayer, a model of proximal renal tubular cells," the
researchers wrote.
    "The results indicate that verapamil inhibition of
digoxin transport is non-stereospecific.  Furthermore,
the verapamil-digoxin interaction is not competitive.
The two drugs may not share a common initial step in the
P-glycoprotein-mediated transport."

ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE INHIBITION DUE TO ACTIVE-SITE
INHIBITORS

    Inactivation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) by the
inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) can occur
via interaction with either of two separate residues that
form essential parts of the active site.
    "This renders it unlikely that resistant mutants will
arise from changes in the enzyme structure," researcher
C.S. Coleman and colleagues wrote in the article, "Effect
of Mutations at Active Site Residues on the Activity of
Ornithine Decarboxylase and Its Inhibition by Active
Site-Directed Irreversible Inhibitors," published in the
November 25, 1993, issue of the Journal of Biological
Chemistry.
    Mouse ODC and mutant changing residues thought to be
involved at the active site were expressed in Escherichia
coli, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography
on a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate-agarose affinity column,
and tested for their kinetic properties and their
inactivation by enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors.
    "All of the mutant enzymes were expressed at
comparable levels to the wild type protein (2-4 percent
of the total soluble protein), all bound to the affinity
column, and there were only small differences in the
apparent K(m) values for L-ornithine, providing strong
evidence that the mutations did not lead to any gross
changes in the protein structure," Coleman et al. wrote.
    The mutation K69A led to a change in the spectrum of
the enzyme and a 550-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m)
(specificity constant) value.
    "These results are consistent with lysine 69 being
the residue that forms a Schiff base with the pyridoxal
5'-phosphate co-factor," the researchers wrote.
"Mutation C70S did not greatly affect the activity
despite its proximity to this lysine but increased the
K(m) about 2-fold.  In contrast, the mutation C360A
greatly reduced the specificity constant (by 26-fold)
despite a 2-fold decrease in the K(m), suggesting that
this cysteine residue is critically involved at the
active site."
    Although cysteine 360 is known to be the major site
of binding of the inhibitor DFMO, the C360A mutant was
still sensitive to inhibition by this drug.  However, the
kinetics of inactivation were altered, the partition
ratio was 10 times greater, and the labeled adduct formed
by reaction with [5-C-14] DFMO was removed from the
protein under some denaturing conditions.  This adduct
was found to occur at lysine 69.
    The K69A mutant was also sensitive to DFMO with a
lower partition ratio than the wild type enzyme.
    "These results indicate that inactivation of ODC by
DFMO can occur via interaction with either of two
separate residues that form essential parts of the active
site." Coleman et al. wrote.
    "In contrast to the results with DFMO, the C360A
mutant ODC was completely resistant to inactivation by
(R,R)-delta-methyl-alpha-acetylenicputrescine and was
much less sensitive than the wild type enzyme to alpha
-monofluoromethyldehydromethylornithine, showing that the
reactive species formed from these inhibitors either
cannot be formed by this mutant or are unable to react
with lysine 69.  Finally, the well known, extreme
reliance of mammalian ODC on the presence of thiol
-reducing agents to maintain activity is probably
explained by the critical role of cysteine 360, since the
C360A mutant was much less sensitive to inactivation by
incubation in the absence of dithiothreitol."

PGP EXPRESSION AND DRUG RESISTANCE INHERENT IN B-CELL CLL

    P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance are
inherent characteristics of the B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) lymphocyte, according to a
report from an Australian research center.
    The expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is
associated with multidrug resistance (MDR), was
investigated by researcher R.L. Sparrow and colleagues in
20 B-CLL patients by flow cytometry using two Pgp
-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb).  These mAB's were
MRK-16, which recognizes an extra-cellular epitope, and
JSB-1, which recognizes an intracellular epitope.
    Sixteen (80 percent) patients were positive with MRK
-16 whereas all patients were positive with JSB-1.  The
proportion of Pgp-positive lymphocytes from each patient
sample varied from 2-94 percent for MRK-16 and 20-93
percent for JSB-1.
    "There was no correlation between the level of
positivity and disease stage or treatment history,"
Sparrow et al. wrote in the article, "Common Expression
of the Multidrug Resistance Marker P-glycoprotein in B
-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Correlation with
In Vitro Drug Resistance," published in the November 1993
issue of Leukemia Research.
    In vitro drug resistance to vincristine (VCR) and
doxorubicin (DOX) was determined by the colorimetric MTT
assay.  All patients were resistant to one or both drugs
being consistent with the expression of Pgp.
    No correlation was seen between the level of
resistance and disease stage or drug treatment.
    "We investigated the expression of Pgp in the normal
counterpart of the B-CLL cells, CD5+CD19+ B-lymphocytes,"
Sparrow et al. wrote.  "A minor subpopulation (3 percent)
of CD5+CD19+ lymphocytes isolated from normal controls
expressed Pgp suggesting that these cells may be the
potential precursors to the B-CLL cell.  We conclude that
Pgp expression and drug resistance are inherent
characteristics of the B-CLL lymphocyte."

A Comparative Study of Candida albicans Serotypes A and B
on the Sensitivity to Antifungal Agents Using the Disk
Method and MIC Determination

AUTHORS:  A. Velegraki, N.J. Legakis and O. Marcelou
-Kinti.
    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 1st Scientific Meeting of the European Society of
Chemotherapy Infectious Diseases held November 25-27,
1993, in Budapest, Hungary, "Candida albicans isolated
from 108 patients with immunosuppressive regimens and
AIDS were typed into 61 serotypes A and 47 serotypes B.
Synchronous cultures of the isolates were tested for drug
susceptibility with standardized MIC procedures and with
a semisynthetic commercially available kit.  The mean MIC
values of serotype A did not differ significantly from
the drug sensitivities shown on the semisynthetic medium
(P<0.05) to 5-FC (MIC, A:1.76-1.88, B:5.98-6.29),
nystatin (MIC, A:1.48-1.53) and miconazole (MIC, A:0.39
-0.45, B:2.42-2.64).  The mean MIC values to amphotericin
B of all four B serotypes isolated from AIDS patients
were 2 ugml(-1) and two of those had increased mean MIC
values to fluconazole (5.32 ugml(-1)) and were read as
'partially resistant' to the drug on the semisynthetic
medium.  The significance of C. albicans serotype-
-dependent drug susceptibility and the effect of initial
imidazole monotherapy to the in vitro resistance to
amphotericin B, are issues currently addressed by further
studies."

Susceptibility to Antifungal Agents of Cryptococcus
neoformans Isolated from Cerebrospinal Fluid

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 1st Scientific Meeting of the European Society of
Chemotherapy Infectious Diseases held November 25-27,
1993, in Budapest, Hungary, "In recent years, fungi and
especially Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) play increasingly
important roles in patients with compromised host
defense.  Systemic fungal infections are sometimes
accompanied by the appearance of resistance to the
antifungal agents most commonly used in clinical
practice.  For this reason we investigated the in vitro
susceptibility of 9 strains of CN isolated from
cerebrospinal fluid:  from patients with AIDS (5), non
-Hodgkin Lymphoma (3) and renal transplantation (1).  The
in vitro susceptibility of yeasts to amphotericin B,
nystatin, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole and 5
-fluorocystine (5-FC) was determined by agar diffusion
disk test (using complex casitone media and semisynthetic
media, Institute Pasteur, Paris), and by agar dilution
method (yeast nitrogen base, ATB Fungus, API).  There
were correlations between results obtained with this two
methods.  The examined strains of CN were susceptible to
polyenes and imidazoles, but one of them was intermediate
susceptible to 5-FC (MIC= 16ug/ml) and 2 of them were
resistant to 5-FC (MIC >128ug/ml)."

Quinolone Resistance

Hospital of Vienna, Austria.
    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 1st Scientific Meeting of the European Society of
Chemotherapy Infectious Diseases held November 25-27,
1993, in Budapest, Hungary, "In 1980, when the first
advanced spectrum fluorinated 4-quinolones became
available, they were particular effective for treating
gram-negative bacillary infections and some agents were
also active against gram-positive organisms.  However, in
recent years resistant strains of Pseudomonas and other
Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive organisms like
Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and
Streptococcus pneumoniae have evolved.  We examined
routine bacterial samples from 1986 to 1992 for changes
in susceptibility to quinolones.  A loss of
susceptibility in most pathogens was observed.  In 1992
the resistance pattern in Austria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa
5.3 %, Staphylococcus aureus 33.3%, Staphylococcus
epidermidis 36.5%, Enterobacter cloacae 7.1%) resembles
the level of resistance in other countries.  Increased
use in the hospital, outpatient setting and even in
veterinary medicine might contribute to an expanded
inefficacy of quinolones in infections due to gram
-positive cocci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Campylobacter
spp.  A control of quinolone resistance can be achieved
by continuous determination of the current resistance
situation, by limiting their use to infections like
typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, gonorrhoea and
urinary tract infections and by optimal dose and length
of treatment."

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to

the E-Test MIC method with the results of agar dilution
susceptibility testing for 17 antimicrobial agents
against 114 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative
bacteria including 35 strains of staphylococci and 79
strains of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
Overall agreement of MICs (+/-1 log2 dilution) was 98.2%
for staphylococci and 95.2% for gram-negative bacilli.
The E-Test produced MIC results comparable to those of
agar dilution when multiresistant organisms were tested.
It was necessary to add 2% NaCl to the Mueller-Hinton
agar (MHA), when testing oxacillin against staphylococci
and the plates were incubated aerobically at 30deg.C for
24h.  The E-Test is easy, quick to set up, does not
require special equipment and therefore has practical
advantages compared to other MIC methods."

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "We describe a series of patients with
resistant E. faecium infections treated with CHL.
Methods:  Cases were patients with isolates of E. faecium
resistant to ampicillin (AMP), vancomycin (VAN),
ciprofloxacin, and imipenem by standard methods.
Results:  18 cases were identified from review of
microbiology records at Yale New Haven Hospital between
7/1/92 and 4/1/93; 17/18 were also high level gentamicin
(GM)-resistant.  Three cases had positive cultures
without evidence of infection.  The other 15 cases
included the following infections:  6 lower urinary tract
(one with bacteremia), 6 line-related bacteremias, 2
peritonitis, 1 wound, 1 CNS, 1 lower respiratory tract.
14 (93%) were nosocomial with median of 22 days between
admission and infection.  9 patients (60%) required
intensive care units during hospitalization.  Antibiotics
received before infection included VAN (10 patients), GM
(10), cephalosporins (12) and other beta-lactams (11).
All isolates were sensitive to CHL (MIC <4 mcg/ml) and 11
patients were treated with CHL:  9 (36%) treated patients
are alive without infection after median follow-up of
28.5 days; 6 died, but in 9 there was sterilization of
cultures on CHL.  One patient who relapsed after initial
treatment is alive on CHL at the end of the observation
period.  Conclusions:  CHL was used to treat resistant E.
faecium infections, however, success was limited by
significant co-morbidity.  In some patients CHL may be
useful for treatment of resistant Enterococcal infections
and susceptibility testing for CHL should be considered."

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "Introduction:  Antiviral drug resistance,
induced by specific pol gene mutations, has been linked
to clinical progression in HIV-infected patients
receiving antiretroviral drug therapy.  Experiments with
HIV constructs suggest that, in some cases, mutations
selected for by one antiretroviral drug may lessen
resistance induced by another antiretroviral drug.  For
instance, a ddI-resistance mutation at codon 74 of the
HIV pol gene has been shown to suppress the effects of an
AZT-resistance mutation at codon 215 of the HIV pol gene.
Method:  We studied drug susceptibilities (using an in
vitro culture assay) and drug-resistance mutations (using
a nested PCR protocol) of HIV strains from pts with 200
-500 CD4 cells/ul, treated for 1 year with either AZT and
ddI (24 pts) or ddI alone (26 pts).  Results:  HIV could
not be cultured from 7.5-12.5 million peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 1 year in 10/24 (42%)
combination therapy pts.  Among the 14 culture-positive
pts on combination therapy, 8 (57%) had an IC(90) (uM
ZDV) >/=10-fold higher than the IC(90) of a pre-therapy
isolate.  10/14 (79%) culture-positive combination
therapy pts had a codon 215 mutation in PBMC (3 pts)
and/or plasma (10 pts); in contrast, 10/10 culture
-negative combination therapy pts had a wildtype sequence
at codon 215 in PBMC or plasma (P=0.002).  ddI
susceptibilities of the combination therapy patients and
the ddI monotherapy pts were similar.  However a ddI
-resistance mutation at codon 74 was detected in 13/26
patients on ddI monotherapy as opposed to 2/24 patients
on combination therapy (P=0.004).  Conclusion:  To grow
in the presence of AZT and ddI, HIV strains acquired an
AZT-resistance mutation but lacked a ddI-resistance
mutation.  The drug-resistance mutations selected in the
clinical setting of combination therapy may be explained
by previous in vitro findings."

Relevance of Gentamicin-Mezlocillin Synergy at LGH

AUTHORS:  R.O. Dowd, D. Bryniarski and M.D. Batt.
Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, Illinois.
    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "Presently, at Lutheran General Hospital, a
742 bed acute care teaching hospital, the drug
acquisition cost for an average dose of gentamicin is
$1.50; for tobramycin, $13; and for amikacin, $56.  With
800 patient days per month of aminoglycoside therapy
prescribed, the cost implications of routine use of
aminoglycoside antibiotics other than gentamicin would be
significant.  At many hospitals, antibiotic choice is
based on 'worst case scenarios' for presumed
microbiologic etiology of clinical syndromes, and part of
the decision equation is the antibiogram, which
summarizes the antibiotic susceptibility data from the
most recent available time period.  Based on data from
our Vitek system, only 73% of Pseudomonas isolates were
susceptible to gentamicin, whereas 98% were susceptible
to tobramycin (We do not routinely print out amikacin
susceptibility.)  Because of concern, that in the unknown
clinical setting, there could be a Pseudomonas bacteremia
that would not be successfully treatable if the
antibiotic program recommended were ineffective 27% of
the time, we asked our epidemiology laboratory to look at
the 'resistant' Pseudomonas isolates more closely.  We
found that 84% of 'gentamicin resistant' isolates, in the
presence of mezlocillin showed synergy with gentamicin
mics of 2ug or less.  Since we always advise the usage of
2 drug therapy for treatment of non-urinary potential
Pseudomonas infections, we were able to recalculate the
antibiotic profile to 95% gentamicin susceptible in the
presence of mezlocillin.  The actual number of
Pseudomonas isolates identified each month averaged 32,
representing 1 isolate for every 25 patient days of
aminoglycoside therapy.  Based on these observations, we
have continued to include gentamicin as part of our
treatment of choice in our guidelines for empiric
antibiotic therapy."

Penicillin Resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae
Strains:  Analysis and Implications

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "Prevalence of penicillin-resistant S.
pneumoniae (PR-PS) in the US has been low (5%) compared
to certain parts of the world (30-70%).  In 1991, 100
isolates at our institution were tested for
susceptibility to penicillin by standard disc diffusion
(DD) method.  PR was reported if a zone size of </=19 mm
was measured around a 1 ug oxacillin disc.  23 isolates
were found to be PR.  To analyze the impact of our data
on patient management, seven PR-SP isolates were
collected prospectively between 10/1992-4/1993.  Five
were recovered from blood, 1 from pleural fluid, and 1
from eye cultures.  They were tested for PR by the
microdilution technique.  Minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) results were interpreted as follows:
<0.1 ug/ml sensitive (PS), 0.1 to 1.0 ug/ml moderately
sensitive (MS), and >/=2.0 ug/ml highly resistant (HR).
4 isolates were PS and 3 were MS.  All patients
recovered.  Vancomycin therapy was resorted to in two
patients.  We did not find HR-SP in our limited study.
High rate of resistance to cephalosporins has been
reported among HR-SP strains.  There is no evidence that
therapy for proven or possible SP infection should be
initiated with vancomycin at our institution.  MS-SP can
be treated with high dose penicillin or third generation
cephalosporin.  DD results for SP indicating PR should be
verified by MIC to avoid potentially toxic therapy."

used in the therapy of NIDDM.  The improvement of glucose
tolerance after long-term treatment of NIDDM patients
with the drug can be explained by stimulation of glucose
utilization in peripheral tissues that are characterized
by insulin resistance in these patients.  We studied
whether the novel sulfonylurea drug, glimepiride,
stimulates glucose transport into isolated insulin
-resistant rat adipocytes.  After long-term incubation of
the cells in primary culture with high concentrations of
glucose, glutamine, and insulin, stimulation of glucose
transport by insulin was significantly reduced both with
respect to maximal responsiveness (65% decrease of
V(max)) and sensitivity (2.6-fold increase of ED50)
compared with adipocytes cultured in medium containing a
low concentration of glucose and no insulin.  This
reflects insulin resistance of glucose transport.  In
contrast, both responsiveness and sensitivity of glucose
transport toward stimulation by glimepiride were only
marginally reduced in insulin-resistant adipocytes (15%
decrease of V(max); 1.2-fold increase of ED(50)) versus
control cells.  Glimepiride, in combination with glucose
and glutamine during the primary culture, caused
desensitization of the glucose transport system toward
stimulation by insulin, but to a lesser degree than
insulin itself (50% reduction of V(max); ninefold
increase of ED(50)).  Again, the maximal responsiveness
and sensitivity of glucose transport toward stimulation
by glimepiride were only slightly diminished.  The
presence of glimepiride during primary culture did not
antagonize the induction of insulin resistance of glucose
transport.  The stimulation of glucose transport in
insulin-resistant adipocytes by glimepiride is caused by
translocation of glucose transporters from low-density
microsomes to plasma membranes as demonstrated by
subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting with anti
-GLUT1 and anti-GLUt4 antibodies.  Immunoprecipitation of
GLUT4 from 32Pi-and [S-35]methionine-labeled adipocytes
revealed that the insulin resistance of GLUT4
translocation is accompanied by increased (three- to
fourfold) phosphorylation of GLUT4 in both low-density
microsomes and plasma membranes.  Short-term treatment of
desensitized adipocytes with glimepiride or insulin
reduced GLUT4 phosphorylation by approximately 70 and
25%, respectively, in both fractions.  We conclude that
glimepiride activates glucose transport by stimulation of
GLUT1 and GLUT4 translocation in rat adipocytes via
interference at a site downstream of the putative
molecular defect in the signaling cascade between the
insulin receptor and the glucose transport system induced
by high concentrations of glucose and insulin.  The
molecular site of glimepiride action is related to GLUT4
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, which may regulate
glucose transporter activity and translocation.  These in
vitro findings implicate an additional mode of
sulfonylurea action in the improvement of glucose
tolerance of NIDDM patients."  The corresponding author

Degrazia, F.; Orazem, J.P.; Young, C.W.; Warrell, R.P.  Constitutive
Variability in the Pharmacokinetics of the Natural Retinoid, All-Trans
-Retinoic Acid, and Its Modulation by Ketoconazole

SOURCE:   Journal of the National Cancer Institute,
December 1, 1993;85(23):1921-1926.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, "Background:  All-trans-retinoic acid (all
-trans RA) induces complete remission in most patients
with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).  However,
continuous oral dosing results in progressive decline in
plasma drug concentrations, which is associated with
relapse and resistance to this retinoid.  We speculated
that the decline in drug levels, indicating acquired
resistance, resulted partly from inducible cytochrome
-P450 oxidative enzymes, which can catabolize all-trans
RA.  Purpose:  We studied the clinical pharmacology of
all-trans RA in cancer patients to determine possible
mechanisms of acquired resistance and evaluated the
potential for reversal by ketoconazole, an inhibitor of
cytochrome-P450 oxidative enzymes.  Methods:  Serial
plasma samples were obtained from 54 patients with APL or
advanced lung cancer after a single oral dose of all
-trans RA (45 mg/m(2)).  In the 34 patients with advanced
lung cancer, all-trans RA (45 mg/m(2)) was administered
twice daily for 4 weeks, and, on days 2, 28, and 29,
serial plasma samples were again obtained after a single
45-mg/m(2) dose.  One hour prior to drug administration
on days 2 and 29, a single oral dose (200-1200 mg) of
ketoconazole was administered.  Endogenous plasma
concentrations of all-trans RA and 13-cis-retinoic acid
were measured in a subset of these patients and in 11
with early-stage lung cancer.  Results:  The mean area
under the curve for plasma drug concentration times time
(AUC) for all-trans RA on day 1 varied substantially
among patients.  Compared with patients with APL, the 28
patients with advanced lung cancer who completed therapy
demonstrated significantly lower AUC levels on day 1
(P=.06); a subgroup with levels less than 300 ng/mL per
hour on day 1 had lower endogenous plasma all-trans RA
concentrations than patients with APL or early-stage lung
cancer or 14 normal subjects.  Following continuous oral
treatment, the mean day 28 AUC for all-trans RA was
significantly lower than that on day 1 (213 ng/mL per
hour versus 467 ng/mL per hour; P<.01), a decline
significantly attenuated by ketoconazole, which increased
the mean plasma all-trans RA AUC on day 29 to 375 ng/mL
per hour (P<.01).  Conclusion:  Reported variability for
the pharmacokinetics of all-trans RA may result from
disease-related or population-based differences in basal
catabolic rates influenced by genetic or environmental
factors.  However, the pattern of inducible catabolism of
all-trans RA is not disease specific.  Ketoconazole
attenuates this accelerated catabolism, suggesting that
oxidation by cytochrome-P450 enzymes is an important
pathway for both constitutive and induced pathways of
all-trans RA metabolism."  The corresponding author for

Shorvon, S.D.  Hippocampal Sclerosis in Epilepsy and
Childhood Febrile Seizures

SOURCE:   Lancet, December 4, 1993;342(8884):1391-1394.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in the Lancet, "The connection between
hippocampal sclerosis and childhood febrile seizures
(CFS) is a contentious issue in the study of epilepsy.
We investigated 107 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy
by high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI).  20 had a history of CFS, 45 had focal (26) or
diffuse (19) hippocampal volume loss (HVL).  The
frequency of CFS was significantly (P<0.001) higher in
the patients with HVL, especially of the diffuse pattern,
compared to other epileptic patients without HVL and to
the general population.  Furthermore, the severity of HVL
was greatest in those with a history of CFS.  No other
clinical or demographic features were associated with
either a history of CFS or HVL.  The frequency of CFS in
patients with other structural congenital causes of
epilepsy did not differ from that in a general
population.  Although these findings show that
hippocampal sclerosis is strongly associated with a
history of CFS, they do not indicate whether this is a
causal relationship.  If CFS do cause some cases of
hippocampal sclerosis, this can not be the only
mechanism, as 64% of those with HVL gave no history of
CFS.  As diffuse HVL is more strongly associated with a
history of CFS than focal HVL, it is also possible that
CFS convert pre-existing congenital focal abnormalities
into diffuse hippocampal sclerosis.  Given the
possibility that CFS may cause hippocampal damage and
epilepsy, they require urgent medical intervention."  The

Lepage, P.; Devault, A.; Gros, P.  Activation of the
Mouse mdr3 Gene by Insertion of Retroviruses in
Multidrug-Resistant P388 Tumor Cells

SOURCE:   Molecular and Cellular Biology, December
1993;13(12):7380-7392.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in Molecular and Cellular Biology, "In
multidrug-resistant (MDR) derivatives of the mouse
lymphoid tumor P388, the emergence of MDR is associated
with overexpression and transcriptional activation of the
mdr3 gene, either in the absence of (P388/VCR-10) or
concomitant with (P388/ADM-2) gene amplification.  In
both instances, Northern (RNA) blotting analyses have
suggested the presence of altered mdr3 transcripts in
these cells, possibly originating from novel
transcription initiation sites.  The mechanisms
underlying mdr3 overexpression in these cells have been
investigated.  In P388/VCR-10 cells, Southern blotting
analyses together with genomic DNA cloning and nucleotide
sequencing have demonstrated the presence of an intact
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) within the boundaries of
intron 1 of mdr3.  cDNA cloning and nucleotide sequencing
indicated that this integration event results in the
synthesis and overexpression of a hybrid MMTV-mdr3 mRNA
which initiates within the U3 region of the 5' long
terminal repeat (LTR) of the provirus.  Consequently,
this mRNA lacks the normal exon 1 of mdr3 but contains
(i) MMTV LTR-derived sequences at its 5' end, (ii) a
novel mdr3 exon, mapping within the boundaries of intron
1 downstream of the MMTV integration site and generated
by alternative splicing, and (iii) an otherwise intact 3'
portion of mdr3 starting at exon 2.  A similar type of
analysis of P388/ADM-2 cells revealed that mdr3
overexpression in these cells is associated with the
integration of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) within
an L1Md repetitive element, immediately upstream of mdr3.
The IAP insertion results in the overexpression of hybrid
IAP-mdr3 mRNA transcripts that initiate within the 3' LTR
of the IAP and which contain IAP LTR-derived sequences at
the 5' end spliced 14 nucleotides upstream of the normal
exon 1 of mdr3.  Taken together, these results indicate
that independent retroviral insertions were the initial
mutagenic event responsible for mdr3 overexpression and
survival during drug selection of these cell lines.
Amplification of the rearranged and activated mdr3 gene
copy occurred during further selection for high-level
drug resistance in P388/ADM-2 cells."  The corresponding

Characterization of Multiresistant Strains of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae Isolated in Nicaragua

SOURCE:   Sexually Transmitted Diseases, November
-December 1993;20(6):314-320.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in Sexually Transmitted Diseases, "The
extensive use of antibiotics in Nicaragua raises concerns
about the resulting levels of susceptibility of
pathogenic bacteria.  This is the first study that
characterizes 18 strains of N. gonorrhoeae isolated in
Nicaragua (1989), for their antibiotic susceptibility.
Strains were predominantly of the auxotype/serotype
Proto/PIB.  There was no difference in
lipopolysaccharides profiles obtained after SDS-PAGE for
all strains.  Variable expression of the PII outer
membrane protein was not associated to antimicrobial
resistance.  All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone,
spectinomycin, rifampin and cefoxitin.  The strains were
classified in five groups based on plasmid profiles.  A
total of 78% of the isolates were penicillinase-producing
(PPNG) and 22% were tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae
(TRNG).  One PPNG strain shelved a concomitant decreased
of penicillin binding to penicillin-binding protein 2.
These randomly chosen isolates of N. gonorrhoeae from
Nicaragua possess high levels of resistance to multiple
families of drugs."  The corresponding author for this
