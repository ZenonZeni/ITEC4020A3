<h2 align=center>Considerations for Investing in Sector Funds</h2>

Many investors look to sector funds to obtain concentrated exposure to a promising industry or theme. However, knowledge and caution must always be used due to the inherent volatility of such a concentration.<p>


You can learn a lot about the way sector funds behave by studying the ups and downs of different groups on a comparative basis. The table below contains the annual total returns of six different sector fund groups, as reported by Morningstar.<p>


The characteristics and risks of several popular sector fund groups are outlined below. Keep in mind that there can be substantial differences in terms of the portfolios within any one broad sector.<p>


<strong>Financial Services: </strong>These funds can hold the stocks of banks, savings and loans, finance companies, brokerages, leasing companies, insurance firms, and mutual fund companies. Distinctions between financial services firms are becoming increasingly blurred. Financial services companies are affected by economic conditions, interest rates, and government regulations.<p>


<strong>Healthcare: </strong>The portfolios of these funds include pharmaceuticals, designers and manufacturers of medical supplies and equipment, and hospitals and home healthcare agencies. Specific funds may invest in a limited portion of the industry, such as biotechnology. Companies in the medical industry must deal with government regulations, which could affect them adversely. Their products or services may be subject to rapid obsolescence. Many biotech companies are now involved in developing exciting new drugs, but predicting which promising cure for a life-threatening disease will gain FDA approval is next to impossible. The Clinton administration's focus on healthcare reform has resulted in a cloud of uncertainty that has hurt healthcare stocks. Nevertheless, the graying of America should lead to continued strong demand for healthcare.<p>


<strong>Natural Resources: </strong>The natural resource funds concentrate on companies involved in oil and natural gas, precious and non-precious metals, minerals, and paper and forest products. Natural resource funds tend to perform best in inflationary times when oil prices advance sharply. Some funds in this group are pure-energy portfolios; they confine their holdings to companies in the oil and gas industries as well as newer energy sources such as nuclear and solar power.<p>


<strong>Precious Metals: </strong>These funds focus primarily on the stocks of gold-mining companies. Some invest only in South African stocks, while others totally avoid them for political reasons and still others own shares of firms based in all major gold-producing countries. Buying gold stocks directly and, especially, via mutual funds is the simplest way to participate in an anticipated price rise in the metal. Since speculators move in and out of funds and stocks as their enthusiasm waxes and wanes, they both tend to exhibit far more volatility than the metal itself. Further exaggerating the moves of mining companies is their earnings leverage. Since the costs of mining are often largely fixed, the majority of each $1 rise in the price of the metal goes to the firm's bottom line.<p>


Gold sometimes moves inversely to the prices of stocks and bonds, and occasionally performs very well during highly inflationary, tumultuous times. But the price of the metal is very unpredictable. Further, a well-diversified stock portfolio will far outperform an assortment of gold mining companies on a risk-adjusted basis over the long run.<p>


<strong>Real Estate: </strong>These funds invest in publicly traded companies in the real estate area, primarily REITs (real estate investment trusts). But they do not invest directly in land and buildings. The real estate funds are much more income-oriented than the typical sector fund, although they can be volatile as the sector has its ups and downs.<p>


<strong>Technology: </strong>These portfolios focus on companies that research and develop new products, processes or technologies in fields such as agriculture, computers, communications, and medical technology. These could be small growth firms. Successful technology companies should grow faster than the overall economy.<p>


<strong>Telecommunications: </strong>Telecommunications funds target companies providing telephone, cellular and cable service, as well as communications equipment. The huge global telecommunications industry encompasses foreign and U.S. companies engaged in these and other activities. Foreign telephone companies are excellent vehicles for tapping emerging stock markets in view of the trend toward privat-ization of state-owned telephone monopolies in countries that don't have adequate phone service. The technology is advancing and there is potential for substantial long-term growth in both developed and developing economies. Telephone companies generally pay above-average dividends, although fund managers often focus on those with capital appreciation potential. The global telecommunications funds are more diversified than the typical sector fund, due to the wide variety of companies in this industry.<p>


<strong>Utility: </strong>Far and away the largest segment of the sector fund universe, utility funds are characteristically more stable than the typical sector portfolio; many utility stocks fluctuate only about half as much as the overall market. The industry consists mainly of electric, natural gas, and telephone companies. The funds mix the groups in various ways or specialize in one of them. Even though utility funds are ordinarily stable, they can be volatile at times. Like bonds, they are interest-rate sensitive. Increasing rates depress high-yielding stocks as well as long-term bonds; declining rates lead to robust total returns.<p>


The following are some guidelines to keep in mind when investing in sector funds:<p>

<ul>
<li>Check the portfolio. Make sure the fund invests in the kinds of companies you want. Major differences can exist among funds investing in the same sector.<p>


<li> Be sure to evaluate the beta and, especially, the standard deviation of your fund.<p>


<li> Limit any investments in volatile sectors to a small amount of your total equity fund holdings, based on your risk tolerance.<p>


<li> Many people are attracted to hot sectors because of their excellent recent performance. Beware of this tendency, and don't buy in too late!<p>


<li> Excessive price-earnings ratios spell substantial risk. If a sector becomes pricey following a period of brilliant performance, an unpleasant surprise could cause its stocks to head south.<p>


<li> Watch those expenses. Some sector portfolios have expense ratios that are well above 2%.<p>


<li> Check the income ratio if you're income-oriented. A time of generally high income ratios for funds investing in a sector such as utilities may signal good value.<p>


<li> Avoid active switching. It often leads to poor long-run results since losses can overcome gains. Also, transaction costs add up if they are imposed.<p>


<li> Don't buy a sector fund and forget about it. Sector funds that have narrower, more volatile portfolios must be watched closely. It is also important to keep up with industry developments.<p>
