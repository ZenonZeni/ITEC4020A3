June 13, 1996 in New York City. Confirmed speakers include Cordiplan Minister

<DD><FONT SIZE="0">Bond issues on non-traditional markets have raised more
than one third of the government's  foreign borrowing requirements this year.
Terms are good and getting better. Argentina is now eyeing the Mexican Brady
exchange offer with a view to improving its maturity profile. Introduction of
regular T- bill auctions has been well received.  A new tax scheme has changed
the competitive balance in the cola market.  Page 2</FONT></DD>
<DT><B><FONT SIZE="2">BRAZIL</FONT></B></DT>
<DD><FONT SIZE="0">The social and political peace has been rent again with
another case of official violence against land  hungry peasants. The incident
appears to have sparked a presidential determination to thwart future such
tragedies; it also highlights the tug of war between the modernizers and
dinosaurs in the governing coalition. The central bank is facing new credibility
tests. The conservatives are due to get the agricultural portfolio.  Page 3</FONT></DD>
<DT><B><FONT SIZE="2">CHILE</FONT></B></DT>
<DD><FONT SIZE="0"> Chilean investors recently caught the wrath of Bolivian
activists protesting privatization and other ills  perceived to have been
visited upon them by the move toward economic modernization. Citibank has teamed
up with pension fund Habitat. Osorno and Santander have formed a Chilean
megabank.  Page 4</FONT></DD>
<DT><B><FONT SIZE="2">COLOMBIA</FONT></B></DT>
<DD><FONT SIZE="0">Private investment programmed under the Social Leap program
has fallen way short of targets,  prompting the government to review cumbersome
bureaucratic procedures for granting concessions.  State- owned properties in
the financial, energy, mineral and power sectors are to be put on the
privatization fast-track.  Several factors are conspiring to significantly slow
down the economy.  Page 5</FONT></DD>
<DT><B><FONT SIZE="2">CUBA</FONT></B></DT>
<DD><FONT SIZE="0">Some foreign investors say they will go forward with
projects in Cuba despite the long reach of the  Helms-Burton bill, but the
general sense of the foreign business community in Havana is that the
legislation will hurt.  Cuban officials tout a surging economy as proof the
tougher embargo is of no consequence.  Page 6</FONT></DD>
<DT><B><FONT SIZE="2">MEXICO</FONT></B></DT>
<DD><FONT SIZE="0">Congress has approved the new private pension system to be
introduced next January. The legislation  limits foreign investment to 49% of a
fund but a clever rider allows 100% foreign ownership by NAFTA partners.  A
merger of two leading telecom companies creates Alestra, a strong future
competitor for Telmex.  New rules to speed commercial disputes should cut the
high cost of collecting bad debts.  Page 7</FONT></DD>
<DT><B><FONT SIZE="2">PERU</FONT></B></DT>
<DD><FONT SIZE="0">The uncertainty now blanketing the country refuses to
dissipate. The oil workers union is seeking to call  a national referendum to
prevent the Petroperu privatization and President Fujimori has responded to this
challenge with some high-handed tactics of his own. The IMF standby is still not
tied down. But the government is taking steps that show it is serious about
raising revenue, a necessity for the IMF agreement.  Page 8</FONT></DD>
<DT><B><FONT SIZE="2">VENEZUELA</FONT></B></DT>
<DD><FONT SIZE="0">The economic breakthrough finally happened this week as
stand-by loan conditions were agreed to with the IMF, and the government dropped
exchange controls, raised interest rates and implemented gasoline price hikes.
The first taste of the bitter economic medicine was accepted well by the
financial markets and the society at large, but the full extent of the shock
program remains to be absorbed.  Page 9</FONT></DD>

<CENTER><H2>To Devalue or Not?</H2><H2>Sides Line Up</H2>
<H2>To Reopen Debate</H2>
</CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">A new exchange rate debate is starting in Mexico, one that
underlines the different philosophies of the finance ministry and central bank
with regard to peso manage ment. So far, the only measurable effect has been a
slight weakening of the peso.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">The public discussion was kicked off by Gilberto Marin
Quintero, chairman of the National Board of Foreign Trade (Conacex), who noted
at a press conference that although inflation in the first quarter of the year
was more than 10%, the peso had actually strengthened 3% against the dollar. He
argued for gradual slippage to prevent the need for a drastic devaluation in the
near future.  His voice was joined by those of other exporters including Vicente
Fox, governor of the state of Guan ajuato and member of a family that has
traditionally exported shoes and vegetables. Fox called on the govern ment to &quot;put
some money&quot; into a program designed to forestall overvaluation. Exporters
argue that if the peso continues to gain ground against the dollar, foreign
sales will collapse rapidly and put the country back into the kind of serious
trade imbalance it had in 1994.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">Exports are growing at a healthy annual clip of 27%. But
imports are no longer declining and have begun to increase. If they grow too
much, especially if encour aged by cheap dollars, the trade surplus could easily
disappear and put Mexico back in the red by 1997. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0"><B>The Finance Ministry Line.</B> The national development
plan, gospel for both President Ernesto Zedillo and the finance secretariat,
favors a slight undervalued currency to promote exports. However, officials
claim that the time for adjustment has not yet come, though they decline to go
on record as to the present degree of undervaluation. Estimates range from
10-15%. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0"><B>Central Bank Differs.</B> The independent central bank
takes a different view, arguing in favor of flotation. The rationale is that
trying to keep a currency undervalued against market forces will only propel
inflation and will not help exports in the long-term. The argument is really
academic at this point, but the difference could be important for future policy
making. Foreign exchange reserves are at a relatively low $15 billion and could
not support any sustained intervention in the exchange market. Thus, the current
mildly managed float is really the only available option.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0"><B>Future Clash?</B> But this could change. If the finance
secretariat were to insist on an undervalued peso that threatened an upsurge in
inflation, Bank of Mexico would counter with higher interest rates. This would
both put a damper on domestic growth and attract foreign portfolio money,
starting the vicious cycle all over again. One observer equates such a situation
to the finance secretariat having a foot on the gas pedal while the Bank of
Mexico slams on the brakes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0"><B>Market Reaction</B>. All this talking did move the
currency &#150; a little bit. After almost two quarters of stability, the dollar
was trading at P7.42:$1 in the wholesale market at mid-April. By May 8, the rate
had weakened to P7.50:$1. A Bank of Mexico official conceded that the demands of
exporters did have something to do with this move, but discounts it as
negligible. &quot;They were surely counting on a much steeper devaluation,&quot;
he said. &quot;I'd say their effort was a failure.&quot; Interest rates have
been declining rapidly all along. On April 9, 28-day Cetes were yielding 37.43%
p.a. One month later the yield was down to 30.6%.</FONT></P>
<H2>Production Finally Up</H2>
<H2>Amid Positive Signs</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">Recovery is starting to take hold. Industrial production
grew 4.1% in February, compared with the same month in 1995. This is the first
monthly increase in the IPI since January of last year; the index reached its
lowest point in April 1995, when it fell 13.9%.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">Mining was the most dynamic sector, registering an 8%
increase in output. Manufacturing rose 5.4%. Construction remains depressed,
with a 2.8% decline in February.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">Large publicly traded Mexican companies saw a 4.8% decline
in real sales during the first quarter. This is a huge improvement over the
20-30% drops seen in the second quarter 1995. Sales by manufacturing companies,
buoyed by exports, rose 5%. Service companies, how ever, remain stuck in
recession. Companies are begin ning to show profits, as cost cutting and debt
reduction have helped boost bottom lines. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">One of the most robust profit pictures was that released by
Pemex &#150; the first time the oil monopoly has made its results public. Its
sales for the first quarter totaled $9 billion. Operating profits were up 60% in
pesos, to P30.3 billion, and 27% in dollars, to $4 billion.  </FONT> </P>
<H2>BRADY REPLACEMENT SUCCEEDS</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="0">Mexico issued $1.75 billion in new sovereign debt on May 1,
enabling the government to retire $2.5 billion in Brady bonds at a discount. The
issue, which had been in the works for months, is considered a coup even though
it did not raise the $3 billion originally sought. Mexico is paying 552 basis
points over US Treasury bonds for the issue. It is a high price, but not
unreasonable considering the fact that the bonds have no collateral, unlike
Bradys' US Treasury guarantee, and that the country is still recovering from a
world- shaking economic crisis.</FONT></P>
