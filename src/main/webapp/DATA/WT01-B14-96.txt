<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>

Goldman Sachs has compiled its own estimate of Tobin Q's solely
for companies in the S&amp;P 400 Industrial index. Goldman prefers
this formula because it focuses solely on manufacturing firms
with stock market listings, not the whole U.S. corporate sector.
Whereas the Fed measure of corporate net worth has declined during
the 1990's because of falling real estate prices, the Goldman
measure has grown at a rate of 3.8% per annum. <B>As a result
of the manufacturing sector's increasing net worth, the S&amp;P
400 measure of Tobin Q has risen only to 1.4 from 0.4 in the mid-1980's
and is still below its peak of 1.9 during the mid-1960's.</B>

<P>
<B>All measures of Tobin Q make it clear that the U.S. stock market
is expensive by the valuation standards of the 1970's and 1980's,
but industrial companies do not appear to be as overvalued as
the Federal Reserve estimate of current cost net worth might imply.</B>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others also have warned
that book value does not provide useful information about the
true net worth of the large U.S. investment in technology and
human capital. The stock market is a discounting machine attempting
to determine the value of a future stream of earnings adjusted
for the return on low risk instruments such as Treasury bills.
The replacement cost of assets provides little information about
future earnings growth. As the deflation of commercial real estate
prices since 1990 will testify, replacement cost plays minor role
in determining transactions prices for property compared to estimates
of rental income.
<P>
There are numerous signs of excessive optimism in the U.S. equity
market today. The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP
has risen to 91% from previous peaks of 81% in 1929 and 79% in
1972 while the ratio of stock and bond market capitalization is
now at 180% of GDP compared to 80% in 1982. <B>The dividend yield
has dropped to only about 2.1%.</B> The flow of money into mutual
funds is unprecedented both in absolute terms and relative to
national income. <B>Equity funds are also absorbing over 90% of
new money flows into the mutual fund sector compared to 30-40%
during the period 1985-1992.</B> The manager of Fidelity's largest
equity mutual fund felt compelled to resign because he had mistakenly
overweighted his fund in bonds. The volume of money raised from
equity I.P.O's is now running at 0.4% of GDP compared to a peak
of 0.52% in 1993 and 0.3-0.4% during the mid-1980's. At the University
of Chicago, a professor of finance recently announced that it
was possible for investors to outperform the market through careful
selection of value stocks whereas the school has traditionally
advocated a theory of market efficiency which suggested that stock
selection was a futile exercise. When so many yardsticks of popular
psychology suggest euphoria about the equity market, it is difficult
for an experienced professional investor not to feel pessimistic.
But the market continues to be supported by a positive outlook
for corporate profits, a modest level of inflation and interest
rate risk, and increasing signs of resurgence in the global economy.
There will probably have to be more evidence of imbalances in
the real economy or potential inflation risk to puncture the self-reinforcing
optimism which is now driving the demand for U.S. equities.
<P>
<B>The Dollar Consolidates</B> 
<P>
The dollar has entered a period of consolidation in response to
both economic and political news. There are more signs of economic
recovery in the other G-7 economies while the markets are increasingly
uncertain about the political outlook in the U.S. They do not
know if Mrs. Clinton will be indicted for obstruction of justice
nor are they certain how such a development would influence this
autumn's election. They perceive that the Dole candidacy is enjoying
a revival but some polls suggest that the outlook for both the
White House and the Congress is still wide open. American investors
have discounted a Clinton victory in the presidential race but
they have not adjusted bond prices and exchange rates for a Democratic
takeover of the Congress.
<P>
The yen has rallied because Japan recorded a GDP growth rate of
13% at annual rates during the first quarter. Some of the uptick
resulted from seasonal adjustment problems with the effect of
the Leap Year on the number of working days but the year on year
growth rate was still 3.3%. While seasonal factors could cause
GDP to shrink modestly during the second quarter, there is little
doubt that<B> Japan is shifting from an upturn driven primarily
by public investment to a more broadly based recovery in consumption
and business investment</B>. The first quarter upturn appears
to vindicate those forecasters who contended that Japanese monetary
policy was highly stimulative because of the tremendous foreign
exchange intervention which occurred to support the dollar during
1995.
<P>
The yen rallied in response to the Japanese GDP report because
inventors now expect the BOJ to hike short-term interest rates
during the autumn, but further yen rallies will be inhibited by
shrinkage of the Japanese trade surplus. It is likely to fall
to $60-70 billion this year from $129 billion during 1994 because
of stronger growth of domestic spending. The Bank of Japan will
also proceed very cautiously before raising interest rates because
of the large size of Japan's output gap, the lingering credit
quality problems of the banks and the Ministry of Finance commitment
to a tighter fiscal policy next year, including a hike in the
value added tax to 5% from 3%.
<P>
The D-mark has rallied because of signs that German output will
start to improve this summer and the strong showing of Mr. Yeltsin
in the first round of the Russian presidential election. The German
output gap is so large that the Bundesbank will retain a bias
towards ease for many months to come. Chancellor Kohl also intends
to go ahead with plans to reduce various entitlement programs
despite the fact that German trade unions have launched the largest
protest demonstrations in the post-war era. Most European economists
are projecting that German real GDP will expand by about 2.3-2.5%
next year compared to 0.4% this year, 2.1% during 1995, and 3.0%
during 1994. The German upturn should also be accompanied by 2.5-3.0%
output growth in the other major European economies.
<P>
The Russian election was never a dominant factor in the foreign
exchange market this spring but if Mr. Zyganov had come in first
place during the first round or appeared capable of launching
a broad based coalition with all anti-Yeltsin forces there is
little doubt that investors would have sold the D-mark. Instead
of holding the wide lead which he enjoyed during early 1996, Mr.
Zyuganov fell 3% behind Mr. Yeltsin while third place went to
a former general who has agreed to be Mr. Yeltsin's new national
security advisor. The supporters of other non-communist candidates,
such as Mr. Yavlinsky, will probably also rally around the president.
<P>
While Moscow equity prices have rallied sharply since the first
round of the Russian presidential elections, there are still risks
in the outlook. <B>The Yeltsin supporters could become complacent
and fail to turn out in large number on July third.</B> General
Lebed is unpopular with many army officers and some of them could
shift their support to Mr. Zyuganov. Mr. Yeltsin himself has had
two heart attacks during the past year and could easily experience
another one at any time. In fact, most Moscow journalists believe
that Russia will have another presidential election far before
his term officially ends in four years because of either his death
or renewed health problems.
<P>
<B>As Russia has never before had an open and free election for
the office of head of state, the recent electoral content represents
an important historical watershed.</B> On the basis of reports
by journalists and independent observers, Mr. Yeltsin appears
to have achieved first place on the basis of a fair and free election
last week. As recently as one month ago, by contrast, many Moscow
commentators had suggested that he would probably have to manufacture
at least 5-10 million votes in order to insure a victory over
Mr. Zyuganov.
<P>
<B>The resolution of the political uncertainty which resulted
from having an open presidential election will itself give a boost
to the Russian economy.</B> At present, the Russian government
is being forced to pay nominal interest rates of 150% on T-bill
instruments despite the fact that the Ruble has been stable for
a year, inflation has fallen to only 30%, and the ratio of central
government debt to GDP is less than 10%.
<P>
Investors have demanded large risk premiums because they could
not be certain that Mr. Zyuganov would either honor the government's
debt or maintain the exchange rate policy which has permitted
Russia to sharply reduce her inflation rate. The dominant short-term
challenges confronting Mr. Yeltsin this summer will be to improve
the efficiency of the tax system in order to reduce the government's
deficit (many firms suspended paying taxes before the election)
and to appoint a new team of ministers capable of pursuing the
other structural reforms needed to establish a viable market economy.
Russia has privatized many state enterprises, including the telecommunications
and utility sectors which are still under government control in
western Europe, but the structure of land ownership and the discretionary
nature of many government regulations (taxes, import duties, etc.)
have encouraged widespread corruption and thus inhibit investment
decision making.
