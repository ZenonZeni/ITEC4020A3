<H2><A HREF="http://www.newbalance.com">New Balance Shoes</A>



</H2><P><B>New Balance Athletic Shoe began in 1906. Although the company



originally produced arch supports and orthopedic shoes, in the mid-1950s
New Balance began to work with runners to manufacture custom-made running
shoes. In 1976, New Balance introduced the M320 running shoe, which
was named the number one shoe on the market &nbsp;by Runners World magazine.

New Balance has been in the top ranks of the athletic shoe industry
ever since.</B>



<P><B>As recently as 1991, a German trade magazine ranked New Balance shoes
above Asics, Etonic, Karfu, Nike, Reebok, Converse, Lotto and Adidas- all



imports. Clearly, New Balance quality is recognized the world over.

In fact, in 1991 alone, New Balance exported over 1 million pairs of
its athletic shoes to Japan.</B>



<P><B>New Balance is especially noted for its superior product design. For



instance, it was the first company to offer width sizing in athletic shoes
and today remains the only major manufacturer to offer it.</B>



<P><B>New Balance manufactures a complete line of athletic shoes for men
and women, including running, court, cross court, basketball (men only),
hiking and walking shoes.</B>



<P><B>New Balance walking shoes are one of the company's newest product lines
and are expected to be the company's second-largest category after running
shoes. These walking shoes are made almost exclusively in the U.S.
and are a high-quality alternative to all-imported Rockports.</B>



<P><B>Although most New Balance shoes are made in the Boston area or Maine,
about 15 percent are imported, so check the labels on these shoes. They

sell between $45 and $60 and are available in shoe, sporting and department



stores and through the L. L. Bean catalogue.</B>

<H2><A HREF="http://www.allenedmonds.com">Allen Edmonds Dress Shoes</A>



</H2><P><B>&nbsp;Allen-Edmonds Shoe Corporation of Port Washington, Wisconsin,



started making shoes in 1922, when Elbert Allen helped revolutionize the

shoe industry by manufacturing shoes without the traditional nails and stiff



steel shank. Over the years, the company changed both ownership and

focus many times. &nbsp;Today the company is owned by president John Stollenwerk



and 19 employees who saved the company from an out-of-state buyout and possible



offshore production in 1989. The company is also the proud manufacturer

of some of the finest handcrafted dress shoes in the world.</B>



<P><B>Allen-Edmonds shoes show up on some of the most famous feet that read

the globe- including former President George Bush's. These fine shoes

are exported to 33 countries and received the U.S. Commerce Deprtment's "E"

award for exporting. Allen-Edmonds even export to Japan- thanks in

part to Stollenwerk's brazen decision to crash a 1987 Tokyo footwear trade

show that had denied the company a trade booth.</B>



<P><B>Allen-Edmonds shoes are top quality, classic style dress shoes for

both men and women. The men's shoes are hand-made from the finest

lightweight, supple and breathable leathers and feature the largest array

of sizes in the world (size AAAA to EEE and 5 to 18). The shoes also

feature the flexibility of a shankless stitched welt design, the comfort

and breathability of all-leather soles, and a foot-conforming cork insole.

The materials and design combine to create an extremely comfortable

shoe. Because they are among the best of the best, these shoes carry

a fairly hefty price tag. The average cost of a pair of Allen-Edmunds'

men's shoes is $230, but can go as high as $1,500.</B>



<P><B>Originally a manufacturer of men's shoes only, Allen-Edmonds began

offering women's dress shoes in 1989. These include classic style,

low-heel dress shoes and boots made from the best calfskin, suedes, chamois

and exotic leathers available. There are 25 different models, including

slip-on, buckle and tie dress shoes as well as more casual yet fashionable

boots and demiboots.</B>



<P><B>Although much of its shoe leather is imported, Allen-Edmonds manufactures



every single pair of its shoes in Port Washington and Lake Church, Wisconsin,



with the help of 400 employees. Allen-Edmonds shoes can be found at

quality department and shoe stores nationwide.</B>
