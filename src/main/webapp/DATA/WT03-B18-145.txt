<P>The October 1995 edition of the CONCAWE Review (Volume 4, Number 2)
introduced the purpose and scope of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive
(AQFD). This, together with its air pollutant-specific daughter directives,
will constitute the legal basis for the monitoring and control of air pollution
in the EU Member States. Over the past year, much work has been carried
out in the EU Working Groups which are developing the standards, and in
the UNICE* Shadow Groups. </P>

<P>So far, four position papers are being developed (on lead, NOx, SO2
and particulate matter (Pm)) by the four EU Working Groups in which Member
States (usually 6), the European Commission, the European Research Centre,
the Non-Governmental organizations, the European Environmental Agency and
Industry participate by supplying single representatives. The Commission
will use these position papers as a basis for developing draft proposals
for air quality standards and measurement requirements.</P>

<P>CONCAWE’s major contribution is scientific analysis, and a CONCAWE AQFD
Coordination Group has been set up to coordinate the oil industry input
into the UNICE Shadow Groups and the cost-benefit study (see later). CONCAWE
has representatives in the Shadow Groups on NOx and SO2, and chairs the
Shadow Group on Pm through which it also takes on the role as the industry
representative on the EU Working Group on Pm. In view of its major interest
in benzene, CONCAWE will make available to UNICE a member company expert
to represent industry in the EU Working Group on the air quality standard
for benzene.</P>

<P>The EU Working Groups are developing a position paper for each pollutant,
which deals with all aspects of measurement and monitoring, and with health/environmental
risk characterization. Based upon the guidelines prepared by the WHO regional
office for Europe, the Working Groups have determined the range of values
which should be considered as health-/environment-based starting points
for EU ambient air quality standards. CONCAWE has concentrated its efforts
on the health risk characterizations since, in most cases, health protection
considerations will determine the scientific basis for the standards.</P>

<P>CONCAWE reports have been prepared for use in the UNICE Shadow Groups
and the EU Working Groups for each air pollutant currently under discussion
(except lead) and for the Phase 2 air pollutants (benzene, carbon monoxide
and ozone) on which work will start in the autumn of this year. </P>

<P>CONCAWE is also preparing a critical review of the recently published
epidemiological studies which form part of the Commission-funded APHEA
project (short-term effects of air pollution on health: a European approach
using epidemiological time series data). These studies have been carried
out in a number of European cities and investigate the associations between
exposures during episodes of air pollution, mortality and hospital admissions.
It is CONCAWE’s opinion that these studies, because of their very nature,
can only be used for generating hypotheses, and not for quantitative risk
assessment.</P>

<P>Most of the work so far has been concentrated on the health/environmental
risk characterization and on the measurement and monitoring techniques.
Recently a consultant has been appointed by the Commission to study the
financial cost-benefits of setting a range of ambient air quality standards,
and the expected health benefits. This cost-benefit study was originally
planned to be carried out by each Working Group, but is now to be done
by the consultant on behalf of all working groups. Through UNICE, CONCAWE
is actively contributing to this study, using expertise gained in the Auto/Oil
study.</P>

<P>CONCAWE representatives will continue to input into the health risk
characterizations when the relevant CONCAWE reports are discussed in meetings
of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, the UNICE Shadow
Groups and the EU Working Groups.</P>

<P>CONCAWE representatives will also continue to stress the need for differentiation
between the risk characterization and the risk management processes (see
page 1 of <A HREF="../VOLUME5/Contents.htm">CONCAWE Review, Volume 5, Number
1 (April 1996)</A>. The experts involved in the risk characterization process
should not make their own choice as to which sensitive populations should
be protected. They should present to the risk manager all known dose-response
relationships for those populations which vary in degree of susceptibility.
It is the role of the risk manager to determine which populations should
best be protected with generic measures, such as ambient air quality standards,
and which should receive additional protection by following up with specific
tailor-made measures or advice.</P>

<P>The risk manager should combine and integrate the knowledge generated
in the review of measurement and monitoring methodologies and in the risk
characterization process with the results from the cost-benefit studies,
before deciding on a proposal for a numerical standard. In doing so, the
risk manager will need to understand the degree of certainty associated
with the health-/environmentally-based proposals for standards. A dialogue
between the risk assessors and the risk managers is therefore essential.</P>
