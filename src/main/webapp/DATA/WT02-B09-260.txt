<H4><u>Suicide Prevention</u></H4>
Some teenagers go through life hiding their problems and feelings from the world, their families and their friends. If someone talks to you about suicide, take it seriously. People need to talk to someone if they can't cope with life. A friend may tell you about suicidal feelings and ask you to keep it a secret. Being a good friend means that YOU WILL NOT KEEP THIS A SECRET.
<p>
You must tell someone you can trust (parent, teacher, member of the clergy or counsellor). Suicide threats are cries for help from people who don't realize that they have other choices.
<p>
Mentioning suicide does not give people the idea or push them over the edge. Talking frankly permits people to discuss painful feelings and can prevent them from committing suicide. This period of crisis usually lasts a short time. With help, people can get past their crisis period and start to work through the feelings and problems that are bothering them.
Anyone has the potential to commit suicide.
<p>
Here are a few ways to help someone who is feeling suicidal:
<uL>
<li>be willing to listen
<li>don't make the person feel guilty about his/her feelings
<li>get help by encouraging the person to call a suicide prevention crisis line or to seek professional counselling
</ul>
<p>
