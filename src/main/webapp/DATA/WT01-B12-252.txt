<BR>
How much did my investment return? That's usually the bottomline
for investors.But the actual annual return on your invested dollars may never
match the annual total returns that you read in the newspaper
or even in your fund's shareholder report. Remember that your
investment's progress will be the result of many factors.
<P>
We've prepared the following hypothetical illustration to explain
the difference between the published return and an individual's
actual experience. In each of the scenarios shown, the shareholders
had a total of $10,000 in the same hypothetical fund on the last
day of the one-year period from April 30, 1995, through April
30, 1996. Yet, the actual returns on their investments varied
significantly.
<P>
To produce the returns presented below, we've used Towers Data
Systems data based on the actual performance of the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard &amp;
Poor's 500</A> over a recent one-year period (April 30, 1995, through
April 30, 1996). The S&amp;P 500 is an unmanaged index of common
stocks that is generally considered representative of the U.S.
stock market. Investments cannot be made directly in this index.
As you know, the stock market enjoyed a generally upward performance
during this one-year period. The high point of the period was
reached on February 12, 1996, and the low point reached on January
10, 1996. For this illustration, however, absolute performance
is not relevant, and we could have used any one-year period to
demonstrate how returns vary according to several factors.
<P>
<B>Hypothetical illustration</B>
<BR>
News item: XYZ Equity Fund today reported a total return of 30.14%
for the one-year period that ended April 30, 1996.
<BR>
The calculation of this return used the same assumptions that
your account statement, shareholder report and most published
listings use: That the full sum was invested on the first day
of the one-year period, that the shareholder did not add to or
subtract from the invested amount and that all income and capital
gain dividends were reinvested. The following illustrate how the
actual returns earned by various XYZ Equity Fund shareholders
might have been quite different from the published 30.14% return.

Today, the best measure of your investment progress is the portion
of your quarterly account statement that details the change in
the total value of your invested dollars. But Kemper Funds recognizes
that you need to evaluate your investment's long-term performance,
taking into consideration your individual account activity. Toward
that end, we are working on developing an account statement with
annual total return figures that reflect your activity. Watch
for more information in this section of Kemper.com on your Personal Performance.
