<H3>Correct Diagnosis and Correct Treatment Are Available</H3>
 
<P>The principal medications used in treating Depressive Illness 
are cyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, and newer "third 
generation" medications. Only patients with a Depressive 
Illness will experience a positive response, which may take up 
to six weeks. Lithium, a natural salt, is effective in the 
treatment of mania and, sometimes, of depression. On 
occasion, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)is useful, particularly 
for individuals whose depression is incapacitating, severe, 
life-threatening, or for those who cannot take or do not 
respond to antidepressant medications. </P>
 
<P>For proper diagnosis of Depressive Illness and 
administration of antidepressant medication, physicians expert 
in diagnosis and biochemical therapy must be consulted. All 
physical treatments incur the risks of side effects and make 
informed medical monitoring a mandatory part of all treatment.</P>
 
<P>Over 80 percent of those treated with these medications 
respond favorably, and most are able to resume normal 
activity. Many find psychotherapy or counseling useful as well. </P>
