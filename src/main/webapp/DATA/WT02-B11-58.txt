<b><hr>As part of the Government’s adult education programme, a revision was made of the Act on Adult Education with effect from 1 January 1994. Together with other initiatives, the act is to make it possible to carry through the Government’s objective of extending the supply of adult education.<hr><br>
</b>
Open education in principle comprises all vocationally oriented courses of education from basic vocational education and training to long-cycle higher education programmes as well as short, condensed courses.<br>

Open education has made it possible to establish a flexible and market-based supply of vocationally oriented education for adults in that the educational institutions are free to offer education within areas where there is a demand.<br>

The main principle is that adults can, throughout their lives and whenever they feel a desire and need to do so, return to the education system to update already acquired qualifications or further educate themselves for a higher level of education. And it is possible to follow the teaching at a pace which suits the individual. The participants can choose to follow the teaching in some subjects or modules of courses or complete an entire course of education.<br>
<br>
<b>The target Group<br></b>
Adult education is open to everybody, i.e. employed people who educate themselves in their leisure time or during working hours; employed people on educational leave; employed people with a low level of educational attainment, who receive adult educational support during the course; and unemployed people, including unemployed people who take part in education as part of the activation scheme of the labour market.<br>
<br>
<b>Forms of Organizing the Teaching under the Open Education Scheme<br></b>
The educational activities, which must lie within the area of responsibility of the Ministry of Education, are as follows:<br>
<br>
•     Parttime courses.<br>
<br>
•      Fulltime courses organized on a parttime basis.<br>
<br>
•        A novelty within this framework is the offer of special courses, the socalled ‘creditcourses’, for persons with long-term work experience within the area concerned. The work experience of the participants gives credit for the practical training of the courses. For the moment, ‘creditcourses’ are established for the following programmes: the educator training programme and the training programmes for social and health service helps and assistants.<br>
<br>
•     Single subjects forming part of fulltime and parttime courses of education.<br>
<br>
•    Short courses of 18 weeks’ duration converted into fulltime. The contents of the courses may be organized freely by the educational institution.<br>
<br>
•       Specially organized courses made up of educational activities as those mentioned above of up to one year’s duration converted into fulltime.<br>

These courses make it possible to combine general and vocationally oriented elements in the teaching. Up to 1/3 of the courses may consist in general adult education or other education, including courses offered by private course providers. The stage has thus been set for a great extent of local cooperation between institutions.<br>

Within the 1year framework, it is also possible to offer parttime courses organized in the form of fulltime instruction.<br>
<br>
All the teaching is organized at local level. It is thus possible to take account of the participants’ and businesses’ possibilities of fitting the educational activities in at different times. The teaching may take place both in the daytime, in the evening, in the weekend and in the form of distance learning.<br>

The educational institutions are furthermore free to offer ‘empty’ study places in the fulltime courses with grants according to the Act on Open Education. It is thus possible to participate in open education even in those cases where the intake to a given subject is not big enough to form a class.<br>

Open education confers the same qualifications as the corresponding courses taken in other ways. Entire courses and single subjects offered under the open education scheme may be completed with a fully recognized diploma.<br>
<br>
The admission requirements are in principle the same as for the corresponding fulltime courses.<br>
<br>
<b>The Educational Institutions<br></b>
It is the main rule that the educational institutions which can offer courses under the open education scheme are those which are already recognized to offer vocationally oriented instruction under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, i.e. vocational schools, universities, business schools, engineering colleges, colleges of education, adult vocational training centres, social and health schools etc.<br>

Under the open education scheme, the institutions can offer all or parts of the courses which they are already entitled to offer. The supply, including the number of study places, is determined by the individual institution itself.<br>
<br>
<b>Financing<br></b>
All paying participants release a fixed State grant to the educational institution. The grant, the so-called ‘taximeter’ grant, is awarded for partial compensation of the expenditures relating to the teaching, and from 1995 in the case of the vocational schools of the capital expenditures.<br>

Other expenditures are covered through tuition fees. The tuition fees are fixed by the educational institution. <br>

Unemployed people participating in open education activities as part of an activation scheme get their tuition fee covered. Employed people with a low level of educational attainment, who receive adult educational support (VUS), receive a grant towards the tuition fee.<br>

Open education cannot be reserved for certain businesses or the like, but must be advertized to the general public. The educational institutions may however offer special, tailor-made courses to certain businesses according to the provisions on income-generating activities. No public grants can be obtained for this type of activity.<br>
<br>
<b>The Activities<br></b>
Open education makes up more than 2/3 of the total public provision of vocationally oriented adult education.<br>

On an annual basis, approx. 21,000 student full-time equivalents participate in open education. This is estimated to correspond to approx. 90,000 persons. As participants often follow a number of different subjects at a time, the number of participants in classes is greater, i.e. approx. 200,000.<br>

The extent of the activities is expected to increase in 1995 and the subsequent years, as the educational institutions become more and more confident with the new and more flexible organisational possibilities provided by the new set of rules. At the same time, extraordinary development grants have been introduced in 1995 with a view to promoting the initiation of new offers of education.<br>

The majority of the participants (i.e. approx 2/3) attend open education at the vocational schools and first and foremost the commercial courses: the Merkonom modular study programme, single subjects for the higher commercial examination and single subjects of the commercial vocational education courses. At the higher education institutions, the most popular courses are the diploma courses in economics (HD) of the business schools and the humanities programmes of the universities.<br>

Study programmes within the technical and natural sciences areas only make up a very small part of the open education provision.<br>
<br>
<b>Ensuring a Relevant Provision<br></b>
The educational institutions are responsible for the ascertainment of the needs of the local business sector and different local user groups and for the establishment of cooperation between the institutions at local level.<br>

A council responsible for open education has been set up in 1994, which is among other things to give advice at central level regarding the make-up of the total supply of open education on the basis of industrial, labour market and educational policy assessments. In this connection, the council is also to present proposals for measures which can further the supply and if necessary also change the profile of the supply.<br>

The Minister of Education may allocate grants for the implementation of innovation and development work, including the development of new courses. Questions to this effect are dealt with in the council.<br>
<br>
<b>Experiments with Technology-Supported Learning<br></b>
With technology-supported learning (distance learning), it will be possible to offer a broader variety of high quality courses - also in more thinly populated areas.<br>

Through cooperation, it will be possible for small institutions/subjects to create new possibilities of increased quality through joint use of teacher resources and an increased supply of quality teaching. The choice of this form will also increase the possibilities of a massive extension of the educational capacity with limited or no building needs at all.<br>

Experiments with increased education and training offers have been initiated on the island of Bornholm.<br>
