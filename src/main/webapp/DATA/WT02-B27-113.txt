<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Evaluation for Cooperative Learning Activities</H3>
Several techniques can be used to evaluate students' progress. Students can be held accountable for their individual behavior and contributions by having a group grade assigned which reflects everyone's efforts. The idea is for students to work collaboratively and do their best so that the group grade does not suffer. Individual tests can be conducted after a cooperative activity or the following day to be sure that each student is achieving progress with the academic objective. A checklist can be developed that lists a series of skills that are targeted for the cooperative learning activity. As teachers circulate and monitor students during group work, they can record frequencies of occurrences or anecdotal notes documenting specific concerns. Group effort and behaviors can be evaluated by the students during the group processing element of cooperative learning.<BR>
