<B>Chemical-laden tanker's hair-raising close call at the Golden Gate</B></CENTER><P>
	The Liberian-flagged Mundogas Europe, a 561-foot gas tanker loaded with deadly liquefied anhydrous ammonia missed colliding with the Golden Gate Bridge by the narrowest of margins the night of March 12 after losing steering. The Coast Guard later commended Captain Don <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="moondoggymap.gif" ALT="[map]">Hughes, a  veteran bar pilot, for skillfully maneuvering the vessel into a forced180-degree turn and avoiding what could have been a catastrophic maritime disaster with great loss of life. <P><!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

	 When Captain Hughes boarded the inbound ship (a regular visitor to San Francisco dubbed as "MoonDoggie" by waterfront regulars) from the pilot boat eight miles west of the Gate at about 2100 on a stormy winter night, weather and sea conditions were troublesome: intermittent rain, wind gusting from the south, a flood tide, and a ground swell producing six to eight foot surf.  At 2110 the Mundogas Europe was just outside the bridge in the eastbound traffic lane on a course of 060 at 14 knots when Hughes noticed the ship's head drifting to starboard. <P>
	"I said to the Captain, 'Hey, we're going starboard,'" Hughes recalled. "And he answered 'Oh, I gotta keep an eye on my...' That's when we lost steering - with the rudder stuck at ten degrees starboard. It went out at the worst place it could have gone out. We were headed right for the pier of the bridge's south tower." <P>
	During the desperate 14 minutes that followed, Captain Hughes drew upon a thorough mastery of ship-handling in tight quarters gained from 22 years as a bay and river pilot to force the Mundogas into a hard turn to starboard. "I told him to stop engines and give me reverse as soon as you can." Hughes also alerted VTS (Vessel Traffic Service), requesting tugs. But the nearest tug was 30 minutes away. <P>
	"My hats off to Chevron. One of their ships was coming in and they had a tug and when they heard me ask for help, their ship immediately released the tug to come to my aid while they dropped anchor and waited. I was in extremis." <P>
	With the tanker heading straight for the South Tower and the rocks at Fort Point,  Hughes ordered the port anchor put down with six shots of chain (a shot equals 90 feet). With the depth beneath the bridge at 300 feet, agonizing seconds passed while waiting for the anchor to strike bottom and drag.  The pilot asked for sea speed astern as soon as possible. <P>
	Greg Waugh, president of the San Francisco Bar Pilots Association, later said Hughes confided his first thought was that he was going to die and probably take a lot of people with him. Indeed, had the pressurized gas tanks ruptured, 36 million pounds of anhydrous ammonia mixed with sea water would have produced a poisonous gas with lethal consequences to ship's company and untold numbers of citizens ashore. <P>
	"As the anchor began to fetch up under us, we missed the bridge pier but now we were heading for the Fort Point rocks," Hughes continued. "I thought 'We're goners. There's no way it's gonna turn that fast.' Then we started coming around a bit more to starboard, then little more. When an anchor goes down and under the hull, you have more leverage than if you're pulling from the top. I said, 'Maybe we'll make it captain.'" <P>
	 With the engines now backing in full reverse, the ship was beginning to slow as well.  Still, the flood tide continued to set the tanker ever closer to Fort Point. "But because we're backing down, we're sitting in the water. We were staring to sit sideways over on to Fort Point. So I said 'Captain, stop your engines and come ahead half.' <P>
	"He said, 'No, no, you'll break my anchor chain!'  I  said 'Better to break your anchor than break your ship." By now Mundogas Europe was wallowing in a beam sea as eight-foot ground swells pushed her toward the rocks. "We were rolling in that surf. I could hear it breaking. And I figured with our thirty-one foot draft, we would hit something at any second. But by going ahead half and keeping a strain on the anchor, I was able to drag her where I wanted to." <P>
	With the flood tide pushing the stern around, and the ship's engineering crew able to manually put the rudder hard to starboard, the vessel continued turning, coming within less than a ship length of the rocks before moving slowly away into deeper water.  Said Hughes: "It was a real monkey wrench turn - my nuts tightened." <P>
	Moments later the Mundogas Europe was well away, safely in deep water off China Beach, heading due West, her bow now facing just outside of Mile Rocks. Hughes dropped another shot in the water and the ship held. Hughes then ordered the starboard anchor dropped. Due to combination wind from the southwest, the easterly flood tidal current, and a slight westerly push from a near shore tidal eddy, the Mundogas Europe ended up facing at a south-southwesterly heading. the By the time four tugs arrived, the Mundogas Europe was safely anchored. They later helped move the tanker into the anchorage area inside the bay between Alameda Naval Air Station and Hunter's Point. <P>
	In the aftermath some critics of tanker safety regulations renewed their call for requiring tankers carrying anhydrous ammonia and other hazardous chemicals to have escort tugs when entering harbors. Currently only ships carrying natural gas are required to do so. Proposed regulations are being considered to require escorts for tankers carrying oil and related petrochemical cargoes. <P>
	What was not in dispute was the quiet heroism of a quick-thinking pilot on a stormy night outside the Golden Gate. <P>
	"Captain Hughes acted quickly and did everything right," said the Bar Pilot's Waugh. "There's no question what he did saved that ship and a great many lives." <P>
