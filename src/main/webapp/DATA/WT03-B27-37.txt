Yes, todays climb is steep in places, but as you'll soon see, the climb takes us closer to what many consider heaven on earth. As Hells Canyon National Recreation Area celebrates it 20th anniversary this year, it seems fitting that Cycle Oregon help in the occasion. Sitting on the edge of the deepest river gorge in North America, eating a delicious lunch prepared by the Eastern Oregon Visitors Association, you'll be looking at thousands of years of Mother Nature's work. In the spring, the area is covered with wildflowers; in the fall, sumac and quaking aspen sets the area ablaze with vivid reds, bright golds and yellows. The Canyon itself is teeming with wildlife. Rocky Mountain elk, mule and white-tail deer, black bear, bighorn sheep, eagles and hawks are but a few of the residents.

Our descent to Halfway will take us into Pine Valley where our perspective of the Eagle Cap Wilderness is just as dramatic as it was in Joseph. In Halfway, literally our halfway point on the ride, residents do things in big way. There's the big pit BBQ being prepared on our behalf; there's the exclusive Cycle Oregon raffle -- a four day, three night, all-inclusive white water raft trip for two on the Snake River being raffled to Cycle Oregon participants only; there's Inga Thompson, a Halfway resident and former Olympic cycling medalist, who will be giving a cycling clinic (if interested, please call the Cycle Oregon office by August 25); and there is much more.
