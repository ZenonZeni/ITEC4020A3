 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENZYME REACTIONS </H2>

<P>   There are thousands of different enzymes in our foods and in every cell of our bodies. Enzymes are needed to either initiate, accelerate or separate the distinct chemical reactions in the body. Without enzymes, most of the chemical reactions that make up our overall metabolism would never take place, let alone proceed efficiently in a healthy manner.  They are involved in anabolic reactions in the body that manufacture or "build up" substances. The end products can be other enzymes or hormones that the body uses to complete certain functions. Enzymes are also involved in our catabolic or "breaking down" reactions. All of these are natural processes and enzyme levels are critical to them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WE NEED ENZYMES</H2>
<P>   A quality diet containing a reasonable amount and variety of fresh, raw fruit and vegetables would supply our bodies with the enzymes it needs. However, most individuals do not eat this way and most enzymes are quickly destroyed when heated or cooked above 106"E  Since almost everyone exists on mostly cooked foods today, or to a great extent on processed foods, it would be wise to consider supplementing diets with SOMAZYME. Even our fresh raw foods of today cannot support us with the enzyme nutrition we need, because they are frown in mineral depleted soils and thus don't have the enzyme content of food grown early in this century.</P>
<P>  Our continued exposure to many enzyme inhibitors contributes to decreased enzyme activity in the body. The average person is exposed to many enzyme inhibitors daily such as fluoride and chlorine in public water supplies, copper from plumbing, etc. Even soybeans and certain other legume's contain anti-trypsin factors, which interfere with the pancreatic enzyme, Trypsin.</P>
<P>  These factors  may create a big  need for enzyme supplementation in the diet for some individuals. SOMAZYME provides a wide variety of the enzymes that support thousands of biochemical reactions involved in good health.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENZYME SOURCES</H2>
<P>  For maximum effect, the enzymes in SOMAZYME are obtained from both plant and animal sources. Pancreatin, Trypsin, Alpha-Chymotrypsin, Lysozyme and Super Oxide Dismutase are obtained from animal sources. They are present naturally in our bodies. Papayotin is obtained from papaya and Bromelain from pineapple. All of these enzymes are well known for their ability to breakdown proteins. Pancreatin also breakdown lipids (fat) as well. Even though the pancreas produces most of these enzymes, at times it may be stressed or unable to produce the quantities that may be needed for controlling many unwanted processes in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FIBRIN PROTEIN</H2>
<P>   The single most important activity of these "proteolytic" enzymes (enzymes which break down proteins) is probably the natural role they play in the blood clotting mechanism. The liver produces a protein called "fibrinogen" and secretes it into the bloodstream.  When fibrinogen contacts damaged tissue, it is changed into a unique protein called "fibrin:' a large, sticky, insoluble protein molecule. When tissue is damaged, the fibrin molecules rush to the scene and begin the formation of a clot to prevent bleeding.  Soon after clots are formed, the proteolytic enzymes in the blood stream begin to break them down, so the tissue will not be damaged from extended lack of oxygen and nutrition due to impaired circulation over a period of time.</P>
<P>   Many of the enzymes in SOMAZYME, and in the diet as well, are produced in the body and break down this fibrin naturally. Excess fibrin proteins not broken down by proteolytic enzymes are a major component of plaque in the arteries. It is actually the main ingredient that lays down the foundation for the plaque and is the glue that holds it together.  In addition, cholesterol, fats, calcium compounds, heavy metals and other ingredients make up other parts of it. Plaque in the arteries leads to arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). With an adequate supply of proteolytic enzymes in the blood stream available to break down these fibrin proteins, there is less chance of plaque buildup.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LYSOZYME</H2>
<P>   Lysozyme is an enzyme that is a component of every lung cell in our bodies.  It is in abundant supply in the fluids that are secreted from the eyes, nasal and sinus membranes, vagina, etc. It is a component of saliva and breast milk.  It is a very important substance in the control of infections as it enzymatically attacks invading bacterial and viruses. Large amounts of sugar in the diet can cause Lysozyme levels to decrease. Studies have shown that taking antibiotics can cause the lysozyme levels to decrease dramatically in the saliva of infants. The Lysozyme in SOMAZYME is formulated as Cytovex, which is a proprietary Life Plus enzyme base that ensures stability and consistency.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-FACTORS</H2>
<P>   Reliable sources of the minerals Magnesium, Manganese and Zinc are included in the SOMAZYME formula because they act as a co-enzyme in many enzyme-controlled chemical reactions in the body and assist enzyme activity. The valuable bioflavonoids, Rutin, Hesperidin  and Lemon Bioflavonoids are included for their nutritional value in maintaining the integrity of the circulatory system.  Certain amino acids and glutathione help ensure ideal enzyme activity. Buffering agents help protect the enzymes from stomach acids and because enzymes are extremely heat sensitive, all the ingredients are prepared by the cold processing method to preserve activity.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SOMAZYME is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE SOMAZYME </H2>
<P>From one to five tablets are taken once, twice or three times per day, preferably on an empty stomach, away from meals as a systemic enzyme supplement for the whole body. Quite often, larger amounts are taken, particularly in short periods of need.
   SOMAZYME is a high quality enzyme supplement intended to be used by those who wish to increase their daily intake of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes.</P>


<P>Suggested Use: Take from one to five tablets, one to three times per day, preferably on an empty stomach away from meals as an enzyme supplement for the whole body. More can be taken if desired.</P>
