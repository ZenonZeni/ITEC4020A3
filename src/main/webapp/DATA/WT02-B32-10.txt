This course is taught jointly by the Department of Food Science and Technology and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Management.
<p>
From its origins over 100 years ago, the University of Reading  has had major interests in agriculture and food.  These have developed to form the present Faculty of Agriculture and Food which is the largest in the UK and provides a unique breadth and wealth of experience in: agriculture and horticulture; crops and animals; rural studies; soil science; agriculture and food economics and marketing; food science, technology and biotechnology.  For the latter group of courses the facilities in the Food Studies Building are second to none.
<p>
The Bsc Honours Degree in Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing took its first students in the mid-1970s, and has produced some 200 graduates.  It is designed to permit the simultaneous study of the scientific, economic and marketing aspects of food in a single integrated degree course without compromising the standards of either.  The degree is approved by the Institute of Food Science and Technology (the professional qualifying body for food scientists and technologists in the UK) as acceptable for graduate membership of the Institute, and by the Chartered Institute of Marketing for the Certificate in Marketing and entry onto the Diploma in Marketing programme.
<p>
<b>The Taught Course</b><br>
Students are expected to attend lectures and practical sessions, and to participate in tutorials and seminars.  Everyone has a tutor in both Departments.
<p>
Your three year course at Reading is organised into three Parts; Part 1 (Terms 1-3); Part 2 (terms 3-5) and Part 3 (terms 6-9).  In each Part the constituent subjects are grouped into modules.
<p>
<b>Part 1 (two terms) modules will be:</b>
<ul>
<li>Modules taken in common with the other courses in the Department of Food Science and Technology, which provide the science foundation on which the subsequent food science modules will be built:
<ul>
<li>Food and Biotechnology
<li>Cell Biochemistry
<li>Chemistry 1 and 2
<li>Molecular Biology
<li>Physical Aspects of Biological Systems
</ul>
<li>Modules taken with students following other courses in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Management which provide the basis for subsequent marketing, policy and applied economics modules.

<ul>
<li>Development of the Food Industry
<li>Economics 1,2 and 3
<li>Quantitative Methods I - 1 and 2
</ul>
</ul>




<b>Part 2 (three terms):</b>
<br>
The 18 modules in Part 2 will encompass the following topics:

<ul>
<li>Introduction  to Food Microbiology
<li>Intermediate Microeconomics
<li>Principles in Food Processing
<li>Competition and theory of Firm
<li>Food Processing Practical
<li>Quantitative Methods II
<li>Biological Chemistry
<li>Introduction to Marketing
<li>Nutrition
<li>Business Management
<li>Instrumental Analysis
<li>Welfare Economics
<li>Food  Chemistry
<li>Theory of Food Consumption
<li>Introduction to Food Policy Analysis
</ul>


<b>Part 3 (four terms) modules include:</b>
<br>
The final part of the course further increases the student-centered learning in the three taught terms prior to finals.  Two optional modules may be chosen in addition to the core modules covering:

<ul>
<li>Quality Assurance
<li>Consumer Behaviour and Food Marketing
<li>External Visits
<li>Food Marketing
<li>Sensory Analysis
<li>Advanced Marketing
<li>Consumer Attitudes to Food Quality
<li>Food Retailing
<li>Microbial Ecology
<li>Food Industry Analysis
<li>Current Issues in Food Marketing
<li>Marketing Research Methods
</ul>

Students undertake a special study on a topic by them and their essay supervisor.  this study is allocated one module in each of terms 6-8, and is presented in the form of an essay (of not more that 10,000 words) by the last day of term 8.
<p>
<b>Assessment</b><br>
Throughout the course, modules are assessed and students will be kept informed of their progress.  These is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1, which students must pass in order to progress through the rest of the coursed.  In the event of failure at the first attempt, each subject may be resat once.  There is normally no formal examination at the end of Part 2, but students must perform satisfactorily in the modular assessments, otherwise a special examination may be required.  In term  9 there will be final written examinations.  The class of degree awarded will be based on a consideration of the student’s overall performance, including results of modular assessments in Parts 2 7 3, the final examination and the extended essay.
<p>
<b>Sponsorship and Prizes<br></b>
A number of companies offer some financial support to students undertaking this degree.  There are prizes awarded to the student with the best overall performance at various stages of the degree.
<p>



<b>Entry Requirement <br></b>
Two, preferably three, A-level passes (or AS equivalents) one of which must be in a science subject (preferably Chemistry).  Normal entry requirements are grades CDD.  A pass in GCSE (or equivalent) mathematics is also required.  Good attainments in BTEC, Access, International Baccalaureate or any other qualifications are acceptable in appropriate subjects.
<p>
<b>Career Opportunities <br></b>
The course is designed to prepare graduates for a wide range of careers in the food sector, government and non-government organisations.  While areas such as marketing, buying, selling, product development and quality assurance seem most obvious, in practice graduates have entered most areas of management in food manufacturing, retailing and distribution, commodity trading, and in non-food industry and commerce.  Others have entered government (eg Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) and local authorities (eg environmental Health), market research and stock broking companies, Trade association, journalism, dietetics and teaching.  some have continues their studies with higher degrees in the UK or abroad.
<p>
<b>Other Courses <br></b>
The Departments offer undergraduates degrees in Agricultural Economics (3 yrs), Biotechnology (4 yrs), Chemistry and Food Science (3 yrs), Food Manufacture, Management and Marketing (4 yrs), Food Marketing Economics (3 yrs), Food Science (3 yrs) and in Food Technology (4 yrs).
