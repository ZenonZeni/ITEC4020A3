<H2>4. EOC SCIENCE PROJECTS PLAN (continued)<BR>
<HR></H2>
<H3><A NAME="anchor15467105"></A>4.3 Initial EOC Working Groups</H3>
As described in Section 3, the development of future EOC projects will start
with Working Groups. At present there are a number of options and working
group areas that will provide initial planning documents for the EOC. These
are ones that have already been discussed and developed within the context
of the previous priority setting criteria and have had some activity under
previous arrangements but are in need of re-defining and re-scoping: 
<H4>4.3.1 Generic Processing Algorithms</H4>
The current best practice in atmospheric correction and physical scene modelling
needs to be made available to the user community. The EOC also has a responsibility
to develop innovative ways to remotely sense the properties the Earth. This
Working Group will establish the foundation areas for analysis of data from
future satellites to which Australian scientists can best contribute, as
well as specifiy the currently best methods by which Divisions can monitor
important environmental variables.<BR>
<BR>
The working group on generic algorithms will specifically examine two main
issues of scene physics:<BR>
<BR>
(1) The results of processing needed in many applications are surface reflectances
and temperatures, but their derivation from satellite radiances cannot be
effected without assumptions concerning aerosols (including sub-visual cloud),
atmospheric composition (including water vapour and ozone), and the temperature
profile of the atmosphere. The Working Group will examine the sensitivity
of the end-products to each of these factors in order to determine the accuracy
with which each must be known to guarantee specified accuracies in the end-products.
Using this information, a Science Project addressing generic retrieval algorithms
will be developed and recommended for a selected set of platform/sensor
combinations including GMS and AVHRR.<BR>
<BR>
(2) Atmospheric correction, time series image analysis, image mosaicking
and earth surface interpretation in Visible/NIR, SWIR and Thermal regions
are all affected by the varying scene radiance known as the Bidirectional
Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The Working Group will identify
areas where the EOC activity can contribute to the advanced products needed
by Australian value added suppliers and to the international work in this
subject.<BR>
<BR>
The Projects arising from these WGs will address generic issues and encompass
proposed interactions with the processing Threads that will develop for
Japanese, US and ESA satellites and sensors (eg GMS, ASTER, MODIS, ADEOS,
AVHRR and others), potential Australian developments (ARIES) as well as
airborne and near surface measurements. 
<H4>4.3.2 Calibration &amp; Validation</H4>
It is essential that the EOC translate theoretical analyses into quality
controlled and validated products. Therefore, a Working Group will examine
the establishment and long-term maintenance of sites for vicarious calibration
of visible and near infrared sensors, as well as validation of derived products
such as aerosol optical thickness and land surface termperature. The activities
identified will build on the existing investment in the CIGSN sites for
AVHRR and AATSR thermal calibration and validation. In particular, AVHRR
and GMS calibration in visible and AVHRR, AATSR and ADEOS in the thermal
regions. The current CIGSN and Bureau of Meteorology sites will be reviewed
for their suitability and their data records and experience used to the
fullest extent in the projects developed.<BR>
<BR>
The GMS Pathfinder project is a specific 'Thread' in the calibration work.
It is a joint initiative of BoM, CSIRO, AIMS and SCRIPPS, the latter through
NASA sponsorship. The first objective is to produce a base level data set
covering the benchmark period July 1994 to December 1995, using best available
methods for geo-location and radiometric calibration. Following this, higher
level data products will be generated. The Working Group on Vicarious Calibration
will also address calibration of the GMS visible channel. This will involve
selection of high reflectivity, uniform and stable targets, instrumented
to measure spectral reflectance of the surface and loadings of aerosols
and water vapour. The instrumentation must also allow recovery of the aerosol
phase function so that top of atmosphere radiance calculations may be made.<BR>
<BR>
Vicarious calibration activities underpin work relating to all platforms
and sensors and provide the sites to test and validate models as well as
undertake scaling and data fusion studies. The WG will provide the basic
discussion of the role of sites in permanent data collection as well as
calibration missions. Its recommendations will also extend to field measurement
methods and ancillary data requirements as well as the basic assets needed
for an EOC equipment 'library'. 
<H4>4.3.3 Scene Brightness Modelling and Correction</H4>
The issue of scene brightness is one stretching across scales and involving
investigations ranging from pragmatic, through statistical to advanced model
based answers to the problems facing users in: 
<UL>
<LI>Constructing mosaics from video, scanner and satellite data 
<LI>Comparing data in time series for real change in surface conditions
<LI>Developing products based on BRDF and scene variance 
</UL>
CSIRO scientists have the capacity to develop solutions to these problems
ranging from empirical to those based on atmospheric and scene physics.
This WG will outline the significant applications issues of scene brightness
and recommend a set of projects to achieve solutions satisfactory to current
user needs.<BR>
<BR>
The brightness variations due to surface BRDF and atmospheric effects are
at the heart of progress that can be made for land surface targets. Atmospheric
correction and land spectral data interpretation all need information on
these effects which can be developed by modelling and field data campaigns.<BR>
<BR>
A Meeting held as part of ARSC8 involving industry (Frank Honey) and international
groups (Alan Stahler/MODIS) has nominated Norm Campbell (CSIRO DMS) and
Elizabeth McDonald (ERIN) to coordinate interest with a small committee
and set parameters for this Working Group. Some of the theoretical options
have been summarised in Jupp and Strahler (1996). The WG may develop a proposal
for a Science Project involving a combination of empirical and scene physics
based studies and their testing on a well specified common base of data.
There is also scope for a thorough study of field instrumentation and procedures
that will complement EO data to allow the scene brightness effects to be
well handled. An outline of the supporting data for the test data sets may
also lead to documentation of wide use in field mission planning. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15468724"></A>4.4 General Working Group Development</H3>
The actual mass centres of generic activity in CSIRO and the needs of CSIRO
and other researchers and Earth Observation data users for greatest collaboration
and support may not be well represented by the initial Projects. The initial
projects reflect the past activities, the immediate obligations to address
the Simpson Report and the level of readiness of some proposals compared
with others. <BR>
<BR>
There is therefore to be a call for CSIRO scientists to suggest, attend
and support Working Groups (WGs) for EOC projects. Funds are being set aside
for travel and support for scientists to meet and provide material for the
resulting documents. The WGs will be reported in accordance with WG guidelines
and discussed by the Science Advisory Committee and EOC management. <BR>
<BR>
The proposals generated by this activity will be developed in accordance
with well defined guidelines and ranked against CSIRO, Divisional and EOC
priorities.<BR>
Areas that could be investigated include 
<UL>
<LI>ground site and field mission instrumentation and procedures (including
the scope for an EOC equipment 'library'); 
<LI>thermal region remote sensing at a number of scales; 
<LI>Australian satellite sensor mission support (atmospheric correction,
sensor specification, Cal/Val, Spectral Libraries and advanced algorithms);
<LI>optical water quality and ocean colour; as well as 
<LI>radar and microwave developments. 
</UL>
Provided there is satisfactory agreement among contributing groups, value
in the cooperative, outcome oriented model as opposed to a single Divisional
activity, a demonstrated CSIRO niche and capability and sufficient staff
and financial resources, the projects with highest priority will become
major EOC activities. In keeping with the EOC distributed Project concept,
the location of the team and its Task leader will depend on all issues of
efficiency of outcome and can be at any adquately resourced location.<BR>
<BR>
Working Groups will generally be one of two types. One type is a generic
studies WG where the EOC Task is already specified and the job is to ouitline
its scope and impacts. The second is the Thread based WG where a product
or a general area of EO data analysis is discussed. For example, Thread
WGs may be for a satellite and sensor combination like ASTER, MODIS or GMS
Pathfinder or be for an application such as optical water quality. Out of
Thread WGs will come recommendations for one or more Science Projects and/or
one or more Implementation Teams to focus on generic Tasks that support
the Thread activity. Thread oriented WGs are obviously more client focussed
as well. Thread WGs will often involve the same people in a number of contexts.
However, the principle of Working Groups is to define the Tasks to minimise
duplication and maximise the effectiveness of the generic Tasks. Maximum
Threads and minimum Tasks is the desired result.<BR>
