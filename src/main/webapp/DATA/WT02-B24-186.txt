<H2>Are you a potential surrogate?</H2>
Our 15 year history with screening potential candidates, administrating
and coordinating of third party arrangements has provided us with the necessary
experience to make successful and appropriate matches between donors and
recipients. The typical surrogate profile is a woman of fertile age, between
21 and 34, who is a mother with a good medical history. She is a responsible
and empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertile
couple have a child.
<P>We only work with women who have known fertility and are raising the child.
It is easier for a surrogate mother not to bond with the child carried for
the adopting couple, if she can go back to the stability of her own family
<P>We do not allow women on welfare or AFDC to be surrogate mothers for the
Center. We feel it is not to their families' benefit to be dependent upon
the money with which the surrogate mother's time is compensated.
<P>It is difficult to put a price on the gift of a family. In particular
lawsuits, the judicial system is asked to determine reasonable compensation
for the loss of limb, physical function and sometimes even of a life. Breaking
down the compensation given to a surrogate mother, approximately $1.50 an
hour, is a small token of gratitude for the gift of life and family.
<P>Women who become surrogate mothers do so because they love their own children
and cannot imagine a world without them. These fertile women have a deep
compassion for infertile couples. For most of these women, being pregnant
was an easy and enjoyable experience.
<P>It is difficult for people who have never experienced infertility to
understand the desperateness by which the infertile couple's life becomes
consumed. The need is great for a professional organization, such as the
Center of Surrogate Parenting, to be available to guide all the parties involved
through the important practical issues of the highly emotional situation.
<P>The Center is dedicated to making the process of surrogate parenting positive
in all ways for both the prospective parents and surrogate mother, and their
families.
<P>If a husband is not supportive, or a potential surrogate's child becomes
frightened by the idea of "Mommy giving the baby to someone else", or there
is discomfort in the experience and uncertainty about the idea, the Center
declines the prospective surrogate mother's application. The process of surrogate
parenting is not for everyone, no matter how caring and sincere a woman may
be.
<P>If a prospective couple is unable to understand the philosophical and
psychological motivation of the surrogate parenting process, the Center will
let them know that they are not appropriate for the program. The surrogate
mother, whether traditional or gestational, is giving a great gift to the
infertile couple.
<P>The Center provides very careful medical, psychological and criminal screening
on all parties involved. Requirements include attendance at surrogate mother
support groups, which are provided once a month in the Los Angeles, Orange
County and San Francisco areas.
