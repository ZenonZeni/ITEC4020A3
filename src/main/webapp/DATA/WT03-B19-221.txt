<P>
Victoria is a State of innovation. For companies wishing to boost their competitive edge through research and development and other forms of innovation, there is no better location in Australia or the Asia-Pacific Region.
<P>
Victoria is Australia's leading State for business R&D, for total government expenditure (State and Commonwealth) on R&D, and for R&D by private non-profit organisations.
<P>
With a pro-business State Government helping Victoria to forge ahead and improve its competitive position in the world, companies are reaping the benefits from the expertise which exists and continues to develop in this State.
<P>
This Guide to CRCs in Victoria  has been compiled by Business Victoria, the Government's business expansion arm, as an information resource for companies. It aims to raise your company's awareness of available technology and its benefits, and of Victoria's impressive research and innovation facilities.
<P>
There are currently 14 Co-operative Research Centres (CRCs) headquartered in Victoria, and 21 with a major research node. They were established to encourage collaboration in research by university research groups, government laboratories and private industry.
<P>
Specifically,  I hope the guide will
<P>
<UL>
<LI>encourage Victorian companies to take up CRC services;
<LI>encourage future co-operation between CRCs and domestic industry; and
<LI>encourage overseas firms to participate in R&D projects at CRCs in Victoria.
</UL>
<P>

The Hon. Mark Birrell,  MP<BR>
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology<BR>
