Resolution</B></FONT></FONT>
<P>Alternative Dispute Resolution ("ADR") is becoming an increasingly
important option in many jurisdictions.  ADR refers to efforts to find methods
which are outside the court system to resolve civil disputes.  These methods
may be advantageous to the courts and to the parties involved since they
may resolve a dispute in a faster, more cost-effective manner and reduce
or eliminate the need for participation by the court system.
<P>In many states, and within the federal court system, the number of civil
cases continues to grow annually.  However, the resources necessary to handle
the increasing case load - primarily judges and court staff - are not keeping
pace.  The result is a heavier work load for existing personnel and longer
waiting periods between the time a civil <A HREF="lit.htm">lawsuit</A>  is
filed and the trial of that case.
<P>The criminal caseload continues to grow in most jurisdictions.  Since
criminal cases generally have priority, based in part on a constitutional
right to a speedy trial, the effect on civil cases (such as personal injury
claims arising from auto accidents) is to delay them even longer.
<P>The courts have tried employing various methods of ADR. The most common
types of ADR are <STRONG>arbitration</STRONG> and <STRONG>mediation</STRONG>.
 In addition, various private companies have sprung up over the last few
years in many areas with active ADR policies to provide these necessary services.
<H3>Arbitration
</H3><P>Arbitration is a process by which one or three individuals, often
lawyers, serve as "judges" to decide a case.  It is a mini-trial, often held
in a conference room or other neutral location, in which evidence is presented
to the arbitrator(s) much as if in a courtroom.  There are many different
types of arbitration procedures.
<P>Arbitration can be <EM>binding</EM> or <EM>non-binding</EM>.  A binding
arbitration is one in which the ruling of the arbitrator is final, and often
can become a judgment, just as if the case were tried before a judge or jury.
For example, many contracts have a provision requiring binding arbitration,
so that if a dispute arises between the parties to the contract which cannot
be worked out voluntarily, they have agreed in advance to have it decided
by arbitration, rather that through a lawsuit.
<P>Non-binding arbitration goes through the same mini-trial procedure, but
the ruling of the arbitrator(s) does not eliminate the losing party's right
to go to court and have the case decided by a judge or jury.  For example,
some courts now have a procedure in which "smaller" civil cases (such as
cases involving less than a dollar amount, like $25,000) are required to
go to non-binding arbitration.  Although the losing side can still go to
court, in practice the vast majority of cases are resolved by non-binding
arbitration do not re-enter the court system.
<P>The number and selection of arbiters differs considerably.  Sometimes
the parties to an arbitration are required to agree on a single arbitrator.
 Frequently, however, such agreement is difficult, and so procedures have
been established to select a three arbiter panel.  For example, in a civil
case, the plaintiff might select one arbitrator and the defendant would select
a second.  The two arbiters selected would then get together and pick a third,
or "swing," arbiter.  Three arbiter panels typically decide cases by a majority
vote.
<P>It is important to note that most insurance policies in which PIP or no
fault benefits are provided have provisions that disputes be subject to binding
arbitration.  Similarly, uninsured and underinsured motorist disputes arising
under auto policies are frequently arbitrated.  However, some recent court
decisions question whether an individual, or an insurance company, can be
deprived of the constitutional right to a jury trial and forced to arbitrate
these issues.
<H3>Mediation
</H3><P>Mediation involves the use of a neutral third party to assist in
bringing about a voluntary resolution of a dispute.  The mediator does not
"decide" the case.  Instead, a good mediator tries to find common ground
in a dispute and encourages both sides to reach that common ground.
<P>Because the nature of mediation is to sit down face to face to try to
reach a voluntary agreement, it is usually necessary that everyone involved
be present - individuals, attorneys, insurance adjusters, etc.  However,
it is usually not required that a defendant who has insurance be present
if the insurance company has full authority to settle the claim.
<P>For example, in an auto accident case, plaintiff may be asking for $30,000
for her injuries, but the insurance company is only willing to offer $20,000.
 The mediator may talk to the insurance adjuster and the insurance attorney
and point out the strengths of the plaintiff's case, the risks and costs
associated with the insurance company going to trial, and the advantages
of settling the particular case.  Similarly, a good mediator will talk to
the plaintiff and her attorney about risks and costs of trial and the weaknesses
in the case.  When parties are open to discussion, often a settlement can
be reached on some middle ground which all sides find acceptable.
<P>Because any resolution as a result of mediation is voluntary among the
parties, it will be a binding settlement.
