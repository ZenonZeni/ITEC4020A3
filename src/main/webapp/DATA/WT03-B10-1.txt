COMMENT

Cable telephony is not futuristic, it's happening now, cutting users'
bills and earning cable operators significant profits, utilising
existing catv infrastructures. It's also a vital component in cable's
move to being the first choice provider of access to interactive
services.

Yet in the UK where liberalisation occurred some five years ago, an
astonishing 65 per cent of UK telecoms managers did not even know that
cable TV companies offered telephony services according to a recent CIT
Research report, Business Telecoms trends in the UK 1995.

This level of ineptitude in marketing, this gross failure to accelerate
the recouping of capital investment, is almost beyond belief. If the
telecommunications professionals don't even know that cable is here in
the telecom market is it any surprise that connection rates generally
are not higher? It means that the salesman is often trying to persuade
people to buy something that many have never even heard of.

The UK may be a test bed for liberalised cable technology, but probably
the biggest lesson learnt from the British experiment is how not to
market cable telephony.

Let your customers know what you are offering and what its benefits are
- its so simple - isn't it? So why hasn't it happened in Britain?
Because, CCA notwithstanding, the UK's cable operators are more divided
than the former Yugoslavia. In five years they have never managed to
cooperate sufficiently well to be able to put out a single national
campaign on terrestrial TV.

And yet despite almost no one knowing cable telephony exists, it is a
roaring success with penetration rates and income levels exceeding
catv. It makes you wonder how many people would know who to call to
install cable TV, or even know if that is available in their area.

No such problems in Chile or Russia, to name but two countries where
the shortage of copper in the ground (what an ironic statement to make
about Chile) means that integrated hybrid coax fibre from the catv
companies is actually a preferred route to introduce telephony. For
countries such as Holland where a mature cable network exists, the use
of ASDL upgrading, or overlay technologies may look more appealing -
certainly financially given the costs of laying cable.

In truth there is not one simple answer, and local circumstances,
including infrastructure and regulatory climate and historical/cultural
factors will dictate the route to converged interactive services.

But there can surely be no doubting now that this is the destination of
the superhighway, and whether you upgrade your current route or build a
new one, without an on-ramp your country and economy is doomed to
suffer the plight of an information backwater.

SPANISH FRANCHISES IN CHAOS

The Spanish cable law bill, finally approved by parliament, comes into
force early this month (December) backed by all political parties
except the conservative Partido Popular, which remains firmly opposed
to the bill.

The first legal cable licences are to be awarded by the government by
mid-1996, for 15 year periods. The PP says the Spanish parliament is
churlish rushing through the new cable law without the support of a
party which could be in power by spring, and claimed the bill was anti-
competitive and advantaged Telefonica.

Madrid, Valencia and Vigo, whose councils are held by PP, have given
the go-ahead to public meetings awarding cable licences on their own
terms. Minister of public works Jose Borrell commented, "Investors in
these towns are taking a big risk because the licences are just for
television and not any other services, which must comply with the law."
Other political parties warned of the possibility these licences being
nullified.

A spokesman for Spanish Cable Telecommunications Association, Ademat,
adds, "We are against this law as it is incomplete and does not prevent
monopolies like Telefonica/Canal Plus." Cablevision, a joint venture
between Telefonica and Canal Plus, started a 5,000 home test
transmission in Barcelona, running until January 31 offering 34
channels for free.

Cable operator Multitel says that Telefonica will retain its dominant
position as it can offer television and telephony services before other
operators who must wait for liberalisation in 1998. Multitel added that
limits on the number of subscribers should refer to the number of homes
passed not subscribed ones. The cable bill states that no operator can
have over 1.5 million subscribers (almost 5 million homes passed) to
prevent a company having 50 per cent of the potential cable market (12
million homes).

The PP has since said it will award cable licences at the beginning of
December in all 54 towns with over 100,000 inhabitants in which it
governs. These licences would cover telecoms and catv, and run for 20
years.

Telefonica will also need to receive the PP's go-ahead to operate catv.
However, the PP will not allow municipal investment in local cable
networks, while foreign ownership will be restricted to 40 per cent.

Sandy Saunderson has been appointed director of business
telecommunications at Cable London with responsibility for business
telephony and television.

TELEPHONY LEADS GROWTH

Videotron's latest figures show dramatic growth in revenue and
operating cash flow led by telephony, with a 53 per cent revenue
increase to #57.5 million for the fiscal year ending August 31, but net
losses doubled to #13.2 million.

Residential telephony revenues are up a vast 79.9 per cent to #27.3
million, exceeded by business telephony, up 87.9 per cent to #5.7
million, telephony income having overtaken catv revenues (themselves up
26.5 per cent to #24.5 million) to account for almost 60 per cent of
revenues. Operating cash flow/EBITDA has more than doubled, from #2.2
in 1994 to #6.9 million in 1995.

"We have entered the new fiscal year with 45 per cent of our network
built-out for cable television and 39 per cent for both cable
television and residential telephone. The forthcoming year will be
marked by our transition from a high technology construction company to
a full-service telecommunications company," says Louis Brunel,
Videotron CEO and managing director.

Total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 (compared to 1994)
saw 38.6 per cent growth to #15.8 million; catv revenues jumped 26.5
per cent to #6.5 million for the quarter with monthly revenue per
customer up from #20.25 to #21.28. Annualised churn came down from 31.2
per cent to 29.6 per cent despite a rate card increase.

Residential telephony revenues of #31.18 per month were achieved, with
churn of 17.4 per cent. The quarter's business telecommunications
revenues were up a third to #1.5 million with business churn falling
from 20.3 per cent to 17 per cent. Loss from operations was #2.0
million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995, up 60 per cent, with the
year's losses at #7.4 million, up 34.2 per cent.

DUTCH REGULATORY DISPUTE

The Dutch cable regulatory regime looks set to be altered following two
broadcasters - Eurosport and Arcade - each filing complaints alleging
operators had abused their local monopolies when they asked for high
carriage fees. Junior minister of culture Ad Nuis said he would prefer
cable operators to come under general competition law, but
parliamentarians appear to favour a new law directed specifically at
the sector, a view which gained extra support following the cable
operators' poor performance at a recent parliamentary hearing.

Nuis received support for a separate proposal to transform Holland's
public broadcasting system by merging the 30-plus pubcasters into a
single network by the year 2000. He proposed that the a newly-formed
public body would offer one or two channels instead of the current
three, with one of the services remaining commercial-free.

Nuis appointed a committee to study the future of the Dutch public
broadcasting system. Chaired by Democrat Mijndert Ververs, the group
will make its recommendations by April, allowin further debate before
summer's parliamentary recess.

EXPRESSVU SCHEDULES LAUNCH FOR DECEMBER 1

Canada Canadian DTH provider ExpressVu finally scheduled its launch for
December 1, delayed from September 1. Blaming the late launch on the
Canadian cable industry, ExpressVu explained that a shortage or
transponder space on Anik E-1 was caused by the cablecos refusing to
get out of the way. Instead of delivering the 100 channels the company
had hoped for, ExpressVu will launch with 40, and move up to over 100
early in 1996, when transponder space becomes available. .

DISNEY CHANNEL TELLS OPERATORS TO OFFER THE CHANNEL AS A FREE BONUS

UK The Disney Channel has told cable operators that they have to
continue to offer the channel as a free bonus channel to subscribers
who take both BSkyB premium movie channels. This is despite a ruling
from the UK Office of Fair Trading saying that BSkyB must offer The
Disney Channel to cable operators on a non-exclusive basis - enabling
the operators to negotiate carriage terms directly with Disney.

ECC '95 PREVIEWS INTERACTIVITY

October's European Cable Communications show was the biggest dedicated
cable event on the continent, with all the main hardware and software
companies present, the telecos taking further steps into the cable
market, a range of cable targeted programming companies, from Travel
and NCB to Playboy,TVX and Penthouse - the latter two hot channels in a
frosty ownership dispute to UK rights, and attendance from throughout
Europe.

Response to the conference was also positive, boosting international
representation with several East European visitors in addition to
visitors from the rest of Europe, Israel, Turkey and India.

The majority of exhibitors and visitors remained British.

Convergence, DVB and MPEG compliance featured strongly throughout the
show - some of the thunder stolen by major unveilings at Telecom '95 in
Geneva less than a fortnight before.

In his opening speech, UK minister for science and technology, Ian
Taylor declared "Anti-competitive or restrictive behaviour will elicit
a firm response from the authorities." In a thinly-veiled warning to
BSkyB, Taylor said that although companies which risk their capital and
work hard are entitled to a commensurate return, ignoring de facto
monopolies could do as much harm as restoring legal monopolies. The
government would tighten up its regulation of pay-TV and access
systems.

The head of the European Commission directorate general for competition
Herbert Ungerer also delivered a warning to 'gatekeepers' of
conditional access saying markets must first be liberalised before
dominant players can be allowed to join forces. "We cannot risk digital
interactive TV or global mobile satellite systems markets being sewn up
by defensive commercial moves before they are open to competition. The
risk of collusion and abuse of dominant position clearly outweighed
potential benefits of co-operation and convergence," said Ungerer,
citing the proposed alliance between Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom and
the Kirch-group in Germany.

De facto monopolies were also attacked by the director general of the
UK telecommunications regulatory body Oftel, Don Cruickshank who
criticised BT's agreement with the labour party, saying that it was
anti-competitive in nature.

Director-general of the CCA Richard Woollam described BT's deal with
labour as "an attempt to destabilise investor companies."

During the show the UK's three largest cable companies, Nynex
Cablecomms, Telewest and Bell Cablemedia announced they are to launch
the first phase of the multimedia services trial in January 1996 to
lead to the development of commercial applications, as well as
establish standards to achievement the equivalent of a single national
network for multimedia broadband services.

Comcast is to roll-out digital music service Music Choice to its
Cleveland and Darlington franchises following its successful launch in
Birmingham adding a potential 225,000 homes to Music Choice's reach.

Scottish Television is to launch a cable channel, the Scottish Channel,
to be entirely made in Scotland, following the channel's recent
alliance with Flextech.

The Travel channel launched an Internet Web site in conjunction with
its US sister company, The Travel Channel. The Web site will allow an
estimated 35 million Internet users free access to an on-line network,
comprising a wide range of interactive travel information. Truly
complementary, additional data on programmed destinations is provided
by Internet, which alerts browsers to forthcoming programmes likely to
be of interest to Web surfers. Access the web using the following URL :
http://www.travelchannel.com/

European Business News is launching a new weekend show for teenagers
and students The Insiders' Guide To Business, designed to demystify
business concepts and jargon and encourage young people to see business
in a new way.

Ericsson launched its new Pay TV Delivery System offering extended
services such as pay per view and premium channels over cable networks
without the subscriber needing to install any additional equipment. It
also demonstrated its Universal Personal Telecom-munication and hybrid
fibre/ coax video telephony system.

Scientific Atlanta introduced its new System 70 fibre optic platform,
supporting applications such as low cost broadband delivery of basic
programming, targeted service delivery to small pockets of subscribers,
ring interconnection and headend consolidation.

Bytel announced the release 26 of its care and billing system Bytel SMS
with additional functionality for cable and telecommunications
operators.

Ascom Telecommunications showed its Baseband ATM modems. CableData
demonstrated its Intelecable Interactive Broadband Module used to
manage and bill interactive services such as VOD. It also showed
interactive service features such as Viewer Profile and transaction
Processing on Intelecable.

BSKYB - "WE WERE RIGHT"

Allen Saunders, executive director, corporate communications at Nynex
CableComms UK, is disappointed with current catv market penetration,
but emphasises low churn rates

Nynex now has 40 per cent of its UK franchises built out, with 165,000
catv subscribers and 190,000 telephone lines installed, and is on
schedule to complete its system, passing 2.7 million homes, by the end
of 1998.

But first nine months pre-tax losses rose 51 per cent to #78.5 million
for 1995 compared to the same period 1994 - as expected.

Residential telephony is a significant success story, with penetration
at 23.8 per cent, and revenues more than doubled to #24.2 million,
vindicating the policy of maintaining a 25 per cent differential below
BT rates. But catv penetration at 18.9 per cent falling from 19.5 per
cent, and significantly short of the industry average of 21 to 22 per
cent. Television revenues doubled - to #26.4 million, and turnover for
the period also doubled, to #57.1 million.

Saunders comments, "We are not satisfied with the level of penetration
and this is a high priority issue for us - we place a great emhpasis on
keeping our churn rates down, probably the lowest in the industry. What
is critical is customer retention. Our last published telephony churn
figure was 15.8 per cent - industry estimates suggest 12 per cent is
accounted for by people moving house and those taken off for bad debt.
We don't really make it easy as we have a 12 month contract, strongly
encourage direct debit, and we don't offer free or discounted
introductory services."

"The product mix is good and getting better with channels like Disney,
and there will be several more coming on in 1996 when we are confident
the industry will break through the barrier. It has grown faster than
the US, developing a multichannel service in just four years."

Nynex was criticised by other cable companies when, along with
Telewest, it entered into a separate agreement with BSkyB. Saunders
says, "It was the right thing to do at the time; after Oftel's
intervention, the rest of the industry ended up with better terms.

"Bundling of programmes is an issue that has to be addressed. My
personal view is that catv will evetnually become an a la carte
service. As a viewer, I want to pay for what I want, when I want it.
People are currently being forced to take channels that they don't
want."

"Some companies have been successful with packages and others with a la
carte so it is not clear which is the best system. There has to be some
latitude in programme packaging and this will be a key factor in
getting revenues from our customers."

On Murdoch, Saunders said, "You have to admire what he has done - he
bet his business on satellite in the UK. But you must question the
Hollywood studios signing up films for such a long time - and Premier
League TV."

"As individual operators we probably haven't done a good job of
explaining our excellent product mix. Our marketing has not been so
good. On telephony - we have brought true competition to BT and have
helped the end user. We have considerble experience in the telecoms
world - its not new to us. People are amazed at the cost savings (of
switching to cable)."

"Number portability due in 1996 could add five to 10 per cent of homes
passed, increasing our penetration 25 per cent ."

Cable telephony probably won't retain its current levels of cost
differential next century as regulators bring BT costs down - then the
differentiation will be the service provider. "Our philosophy is to get
the customer for life. Both the level of service and the service range
has to be the latest and the best - you can't have a failing network."

Would Nynex use ADSL technology to bring (existing) networks to the
standard of fibre? "No. In the US we are committing to change copper
networks for fibre. The Select Party review which said early entry by
BT into the entertainment market would result in #10 billion to upgrade
to fibre described something which it is going to have to do anyway."

"A billion pounds was wiped off cable stock when (oppositionleader)
Blair made his unclear statement. What will they (BT) do to help the
hospitals, schools or libraries that they have connected? We are the
unsung heroes, connecting them today."

There was a silver lining however as, "It was a key part of Blair's
speech and so it was good to get cable on the political agenda. It has
a raised public awareness of cable."

On new technologies, Saunders explained, "We have commercial
interactive services on trial and have talked with a lot of people, but
nothing is concluded at this stage. There is a market requirement for
games, but it has to be packaged at the right price for the user. We
welcome PPV coming in and expect to have something in place in 1996. We
expect time shifting will also be a great winner, provided as a form of
pay per view."

Lack of commercial interactive services reflects perceived market
readiness, availability of service providers and pricing rather than
implementation issues explains Saunders, declaring, "Technology is not
a problem, we have a network that will take whatever you want put down
it."

TELEPHONY: THE BIG PICTURE

A new report on the UK Cable Market from Goldman Sachs provides an
excellent overview of the current UK cable market, including many
observations on cable telephony in the UK that will have relevance to
other catv operators looking to introduce telephony

The main thrust of the report is that competition will continue to
increase and prices will fall, but that the market remains a lucrative
one with great potential for revenue earnings, though its relative
small size could result in mergers.

Combined catv/telephony revenues in the UK are currently around #60
($100) per home, triple the $32 per home achieved in the US. Cable
franchise areas are exclusive and interconnect charges are regulated,
so profitability is ensured, which has spurned on the UK build rate,
leaping 55 per cent to 850,000 homes passed in the first half of 1995.

Long term forecasts for cable telephony penetration are 38 per cent by
2003, but the average residential penetration is 25 per cent though
Diamond Cable is achieving 45 per cent. This has been achieved prior to
number portability which should be in force in 1996 - forecast to boost
penetration by 6 to 8 per cent. "The lack of portability acts as a
disincentive to changing supplier and if this barrier is removed I am
convinced that suppliers will strive to improve their services to
attract new customers and improve efficiency," says Don Cruickshank,
director general of Oftel.

Business telephony penetration varies wildly between operators, from
single figures to 23 per cent, and it accounts for 45 per cent of
revenues at Diamond Cable.

BT has a 90 per cent share of the #12.8 bn ($20.2 bn) UK telephony
market. But since opening up, this relatively small market has become
highly competitive with multiple long distance operators, multiple
wireless operators, and a growing number of local exchange operators
(BT, Mercury, Colt and the cable operators) hence there is expected to
be pressure for consolidation. Goldman Sachs suggests that UK cable
revenues (including catv and interactive services) are set to rise
1,900 per cent from #350 m ($553 m) in 1994 to #6.7 bn ($10.59 bn) by
2003.

Interconnect pricing is controlled by Oftel, but if and when BT looses
more than 25 per cent of the market (expected around 2001), current
legislation says cable will have to pay an Access Deficit Charge,
contributing toward the subsidy that BT claims it makes in local
interconnect pricing - though by that time open competition is
expected.

Meanwhile, BT is expected to increase its competition for the local
loop on the basis of Oftel dictated pricing - annual price reductions
equal to inflation (RPI) minus a productivity factor of 7.5 per cent
through to 1997. This equals some #400 m of annual price reductions,
but BT staffing is falling by 10,000 per year saving #250 m with
further savings in office space etc while lines are growing by 2 per
cent annually. BT would need to spend #15 billion ($23.7 bn) to rebuild
its network with fibre optic cabling. Most regional Bell Operating
Companies in the US have announced switched broadband overlay trials,
rather than using ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line)
technology, and so BT was expected to upgrade its network to fibre. But
a potential future Labour government (currently poll favourites) may
legislate to make it attractive to BT to interconnect with cable for
broadband services in the local loop rather than replicate the cable
companies' network.

Telecommunication companies Mercury and Energis are not seen as local
loop competitors, but their direct competition with BT in the long
distance interconnect should reduce interconnect charges to cable
companies. BT has introduced a range of incentives to maintain its
customers and also sends direct mail and calls people in newly cabled
areas to dissuade them from subscribing to cable telephony. It has also
(up until now) refused customer's number portability to cable, and
markets satellite dishes through its BT shops.

Videotron and Diamond Cable have responded by offering free local calls
between cable subscribers, and in all categories, cable telephony has
responded to BT price cuts, maintaining a pricing differential of 10 to
15 per cent below BT in every tariff category, with Nynex CableComms
saying it will maintain a 25 per cent discount to BT for the medium
term.

Another problem for BT is that it is the higher usage customers which
it is loosing. BT's average monthly residential spend is #18.50
compared to cable's residential telephony spend of #24. This may result
in targeted price reductions from BT in relation to specific
competitors and sectors, but it is not allowed to vary its pricing
geographically. However, it can use strategies such as price discounts
to selected numbers which are also BT, so that one person switching
would affect a whole circle of friends.

Both usage and the number of lines in the market is expanding
sufficiently to more than make up for the price declines as falling
prices stimulate usage growth.

In the face of falling prices, the report says success in the
telecommunications market will increasingly be driven by product
innovation, itself driven by software and marketing which highlights
these innovations.

Cable companies are buying the latest generation of switches to lead
the introduction of new services including voice mail, and Teen Talk
(Bell Cable) with different numbers on the same line.

The introduction of Centrex in business sites provides phantom PBX
internal communications solutions to form the local switch.

In London the interconnect local group has launched Integrated
Communications Network capital wide, offering private networks and
circuits and high speed data links plus standard telephony. This is
expected to be followed by the launch of a national cable business
telephony initiative with its own branding, expected within 18 months,
possibly using a company such as Energis for its long distance
operator.

BT and Mercury interconnection charges including local switching make
investment by cable companies in their own switches not only viable but
virtually inevitable, and most now have their own local switching
(Digital Local Exchanges). For an optimal nationally switched network,
a national joint venture between cable companies and perhaps a third
party is postulated.

Cable companies are advised to bid for wireless local loop licences in
their own areas for both defensive and offensive reasons, as the main
cost is the headend switching which could be merged with the catv
headend - and wireless would extend cable's telecommunication service
into rural areas.

For US companies looking to replicate their success in the UK back
home, costs will be higher as they will have to upgrade existing cable
plant through hybrid fibre/coax rebuilds and the deployment of
switching, independent power and subscriber network interface devices.

LOCAL LOOP BARS COMPETITION

Removing the local loop from state monopolies is seen as the biggest
barrier to competition, with the local loop accounting for 70 per cent
of the huge cost of building a national phone network.

The stranglehold on local telephone lines by state-owned monopolies
like France Telekom and Deutsche Telecom threatens to prevent the
genuine opening of European telecoms markets to competition by the
start of 1998 says a new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It
suggests that the local loop should be owned by independent companies
concerned only with providing local access for any telecom operator,
and that these companies should get a set exclusive period in return
for upgrading the network to handle multimedia services.

BT in the UK saw its labour force cut by some 40 per cent (100,000
jobs) following privatisation, hence there is strong political and
union pressure to prevent a repetition in continental Europe's PTTs.

The Association of Private European Cable Operators (Apec) has called
on Europe's regulatory authorities to allow catv operators to directly
interconnect their networks, not via telecom leased lines but by their
own means - similar to the interconnect groups now being established in
the UK. It has also called for liberalisation of telephony on
alternative infrastructures before January 1998, with the January 1996
limited liberalisation as merely a timid first step.

Again, mirroring the UK model, Apec has called for seven to 10 year
periods of exclusivity rather than allowing public telecoms
organisations to enter entertainment markets as sooon as cable
operators enter voice telephony, citing the PTTs dominant postion and
decades-old monopolies as advantages to be overcome. A quick solution
to the problems of number portability and universal service are also
called for.

CORNERSTONE OFFERS COMPETITIVE EDGE

Global catv market players are increasingly turning to suppliers for
services beyond traditional voice switching to provide a competitive
edge to attract subscriber business.

Commercially attractive solutions are sought in the switching,
transport and access portions of their broadband networks. Nortel in
the UK is enlarging its product portfolio to meet this demand by
operators to deploy advanced data and multimedia services to business
and residential communities.

Flexibility is an essential part of Nortel's Cornerstone range which
comprises a family of coax access systems that interface seamlessly
with its switching, data and transmission products and can be tailored
to specific catv franchise requirements.

Cornerstone allows catv operators to introduce multiple services on to
their networks incrementally.

Cornerstone Voice and Cornerstone Data, enable existing HFC networks to
carry additional services, generating new revenue through controlled
incremental investment.

The Voice option enables narrowband services, from standard telephony
to advanced CLASS (customer local area signalling) features - such as
caller ID and call waiting - to be delivered over standard HFC plant.
Transmission quality, reliability and grade of service can exceed the
current copper telephony infrastructure.

Cornerstone Data enables catv operators to enter the growing home
working market, delivering high-speed data communications services
across their existing network, letting the service provider offer a
highly-competitive quality of service and feature set.

The emphasis is on delivery at a reasonable cost to subscribers, with
only minor modifications to existing cable plant and low capital
investment, even at low penetration levels.

By sharing bandwidth among a number of users, the Data option provides
a high peak rate to each user as most users only need network access
for a short time, downloading Web pages, or graphics files from an
office server. It uses ATM between the head-end and the data port to
ensure bandwidth is fairly distributed between users.

Cornerstone Data also lets operators charge users for the bandwidth
they take, not their connect time, allowing subscribers to browse
without having to disconnect then re-connect to a service and without
incurring bills for idle connect time.

Future Cornerstone products undergoing field trials offer multimedia
and wireless applications. Multimedia applications include highly
interactive services such as educational VOD, home shopping and
interactive games.

Cablevision Lightpath, the telephony subsidiary of Cablevision Systems,
is piloting and plans wide-scale deployment of services based on
Cornerstone Voice over its catv network in the New York City area. New
Brunswick Telephone is the first implementation of multimedia
applications with services due to include educational VOD, interactive
home shopping and advanced telecommunications services.

In October, Bell Cablemedia chose Nortel's ATM Magellan Passport switch
to run BCM's pilot data service in its London franchise area. This new
network includes Internet access, videoconferencing, LAN
interconnection and voice over ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode).
Magellan Passports are being deployed alongside Nortel Rapport Internet
access dial-up switches.

LOW-COST INTERACTIVITY IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATIONAL

Israel's Gad Line has developed a communication system for telephony
over cable allowing low cost implementation of a variety of interactive
applications which is already fully operational, serving subscribers
worldwide. Gad Line saw the potential to take advantage of the two-way
broadband coax/fibre network infrastructure by utilising it to meet the
demand for efficient two-way video, voice and data communication
channels.

Its voice/data system incorporates communal telephony, public telephony
emergency and security features, data transfer including facsimiles,
the Internet etc and utility management. The utility feature has been
implemented by a German electric company to monitor electricity
consumption, and an exclusive residential complex in Brazil uses the
system for its security and internal telephony features. Other
voice/data systems have been installed internationally. The system's
largest contract is for the telephonic networking of Tianjin, China,
with its population of 8 million.

By mid-1996 Gad Line expects to have pilot schemes starting on its
digital system for the transfer of E1/T1, long-distance learning, home
shopping, VOD etc utilising microelectronic integrated technology
within one unified system.

The existing analogue voice/data system utilises frequencies which are
not occupied by the cable television channels over the catv network
with FDM technology with FSK modulation. The system comprises a
subscriber modem as the basic unit which is sited at the home or office
of the use. This unit interfaces between a standard telephone, fax or
computer and the catv network. It blocks noisy frequencies, allocates
the free frequencies to the subscribers, and is used for assigning ad
changing subscriber ID numbers.

Trunk interface units and trunk protocol converters perform the link
and the protocol conversion between the Public Switched Telephony
network and the telephony over cable system.

HYBRID FIBRE COAX CABLE TELEPHONY ON SHOW

During ECC '95 Ericsson demonstrated its hybrid fibre coax telephone
delivery system, developed in collaboration with First Pacific
Networks. There is no telephony overlay in integrated delivery - only
the hybrid fibre coax cable TV network is built. An RF modem in the
home connects to the incoming coax and provides a master socket and an
outlet at the set top box for cable TV. FPN's 10001 product has proven
itself in the UK, reducing overall build costs.

LETTING THE LOOP LOOSE

Terry Meredith of West End discusses integrating telephony and TV in a
cable network using HFC with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
to overcome capacity limits on the local loop

The initial premise is that operators using hybrid fibre/coax (HFC) can
save between 10 to 30 per cent in costs (depending on the country)
compared to an overlay approach. Using HFC, operators with installed
catv networks can avoid the civils cost of cable laying, gaining
privacy and security, which must be ensured by HFC due to the change
from a traditional copper star wired network to a shared star/bus
architecture.

Bandwidth efficiency is essential. The return path of a catv network is
typically five to 55 MHz, and an integrated HFC architecture must pack
circuits into this bandwidth without lowering the grade of service or
needing the local loop to be engineered.

Reliability of catv networks must also be assured, enabling them to
support lifeline telephony services, and so power plant must be planned
to provide the necessary levels of resilience, with home units
providing various powering options. Also, integrated TV/telephony must
provide flexible end to end service provision.

When looking at the architectural options available, HFC is the first
choice due to its broadband capability, with RF catv designs able to
provide multiple services on a single network. Standard catv
architecture with a bolt-on approach is the most cost effective
solution, eliminating construction, minimising cost and delivering
services to the customer as soon as they sign on.

In a catv network which has a return path implemented, telephony (plus
data and interactive services) can be added using the WestBound 9600
Broadband Access Platform by connecting a WestBound 9645 Broadband
Manager at the headend and one of a range of subscriber drops at the
user end. The WestBound 9600 supports multiple value added services
such as internet access and telephony. Every 64kB/s channel from the
headend is guaranteed a path in the same way as a traditional copper
network PTT, so there is no blocking and the integral cross connect
functionality at the head end is an important factor for leased line
networks.

It is possible to pack 480 x 64K channels into one 8MHz catv channel in
a totally on-blocking way eg 12 MHz supporting 720 channels provide for
greater than 100 per cent penetration in a typical HFC catv design. And
there are a range of other benefits accruing from use of orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing - utilising 500 carriers (tones) each
2kHz wide and carrying 10kB/s of information. If ingress hits one of
the 2kHz bands, its affect is minimal, unlike single carrier systems
such as QPSK.

Security features include unique frequency allocation per subscriber,
and inherent random scrambling, similar to PCM AMI techniques.

Multiple integrated services for the residential and business market
include supporting digital or analogue telephony, with Centrex working,
leased line services for telephony and data, Lan interconnect services
with optional integral frame relay connectivity; teleworking
home/office connections, remote Lan, speeds up to 256kB/s; Infonet
services to add information services and gateways to third parties such
as the Internet. Future uses are expected to incorporate multimedia
services networks and the architecture - if not the infrastructure - is
already established to handle these services.

Continental Europe is particularly enthusiastic about employing 'bolt-
on' solutions to introduce telephony while the UK has an overlay
mentality, whereas in Eastern Europe and Latin America there are
bottlenecks in their local loops, with not enough copper in the ground,
are finding it more cost effective to increase telephony via catv
development. "We are aiming to be the local loop company in these
countries," says Meredith.

PARTNERSHIPS EXTEND ADC BROADBAND OFFERING

During Telecom 95 ADC Telecommunications Inc and Nokia
Telecommunications signed an agreement to cooperate on product
development for the global cable TV and telecommunications markets
based on ADC's Homeworx hybrid fibre coax broadband access platform and
Nokia's ACM2 access products. This will include joint development of
interfaces for EISI standard countries, and joint development of next
generation broadband platform solutions

"Our overlay system uses Nokia's SDH overlay for data using ACM2 - we
can take overlay networks to integrated networks," explained ADC's
Lynne High, adding that the cooperation meant the companies were able
to expand more rapidly, from a video product today to the incorporation
of voice/data from the same company.

ACM2 is a two megabit per second primary rate family for voice and data
services, while the Homeworx platform transports both digital and
broadband signals as well as narrowband telephony and data services
over HFC. ADC has also formed a telecom alliance with Hitachi telecom,
initially focused on sales and marketing, offering an end-to-end
solution for customers, including marketing Hitachi's Synchronous
optical network and ATM equipment with ADC's Soneplex and Homeworx
broadband access/transport platforms. A second phase will include a
joint venture for new products and further product integration. A cable
modem jointly developed with NetComm is scheduled to be available in
mid-1996.

CABLE ARRIVES AT TELECOM '95

As the divide between industry sectors becomes ever more blurred, the
cable fraternitynow participates in the encroaching telephony market -
including its four yearly extravaganza in Geneva, Telecom '95, held in
early in October.

Sponsored by the International Telecommunications Union, the show saw a
reputed $1 billion spent on stands by the 1,066 exhibitors, sprawled
over four exhibition floors, thronging with 189,671 participants - up
18 per cent on the 1991 event.

Larry Ellison, chairman and CEO or Oracle Corporation outlined his view
of the future - a fast network delivering everything to cheap set top
boxes. Under the company's plan, cable television would remain separate
from other devices such as computers and telephones but those devices
would be almost disposable.

 Network connected devices would download all the software and systems
needed to run direct from the network when switched on. The cable
providers couldchange systems often as the devices re-configure
themselves each time they are switched on. Set-top boxes being used by
BT in its interactive TV trials are the first examples of such
products.

Ellison suggests that "there is nothing less important than movies on
demand (MOD)" and he sees education, news on demand and commerce as far
more important, saying no cable company could justify building a new
network for Movies On Demand.

Ipitek Corporation was showing its new software system that allows
cable companies to make use of existing connections to satellite farms,
TV stations and other facilities by offering to route traffic between
them and charge for the service. Using new computer software in
conjunction with the California-based company's line up of Fibrehub and
Imtran Fibre Optic Transmission System units, the system offers more
flexibility and remote control of each point on the network from a
single PC.

ADC Telecommunications announced a development agreement with Nokia and
showed its line of Homeworx broadband access platforms (also see ADC
article this issue).

Ortel was receiving interntional interest for its linear optics
technology. The recently developed System-1000 unit allows operators to
take the complete frequency range from a satellite head end and send it
up to 40 km to the cable company. Ortel's Richard Mullikin, business
manager of satellite communications, said, "Ortel's System 1000 is
capable of accepting greater frequency ranges, it is cost-effective and
can be installed in a day."

Nortel launched Cogent at the show, an independent subsidiary of
Nortel, created to provide a complete consultancy for companies wishing
to build new networks or upgrade existing ones.

Brian Gowers, managing director of Cogent, explained the company would
supply its own personnel to initially come up with a network plan for
the desired system and, once agreed on, would offer contracts for
supply of the equipment.

Gowers stressed that it wasn't just a way to sell Nortel equipment,
pointing out that it chose Alcatel access equipment. He added tht none
of Nortel's competitors had refused to provide detailed technical
specifications for he bides and tht showed that they al recognised
Cogent as being independent.

As the system is built, Cogent supply key management personnel and will
take charge of hiring and training of employees in all areas of the
business from operation to sales.

The relationship built up with Cogent continues through to after-system
launch with Gowers adding, "We wouldn't want to exit less than 12
months after launch. Trying to step out too soon is a recipe to fall
over. It is a long term relationship."

The expo also saw the public debut of several new multimedia operating
systems. Sony unveiled its new system, Apertos, complete with a
futuristic looking set top box dubbed Pecchi, the Personal
Entertainment Computer and Communicator for Home Interaction.

Apertos offers a system on which operators can build complete
multimedia and video on demand services while the Pecchi box acts like
a traditional set top box as the interface between the network and in
home equipment which can now include a television set and radio tuner
plus computer or cable telephone.

Also competing was NEC Corporation which debuted a system that included
a broadband access network management system for fibre- to-the-curb and
fibre-to-the-building, and a service management system for VOD.

The ITU used the occasion to release its 250 page second World
Telecommunication Development Report on the state of telecoms around
the world. Among its main finding was that, internationally, the number
of new subscribers to cable television is continuing to rise.

In 1994 14.5 million cable subscribers were added, exceeding the 13.7
million rise in 1993. According to the ITU figures, almost 173 million
homes world-wide are now cabled including 76 million in the USA, 57
million in Asia and 38 million in Europe.

INTEGRATION ON TRIAL

Annual revenues for telephony via cable are now #330 million in the UK,
and forecast to exceed #1 billion by the year 2000, but this success
relies heavily on the capital needed to build the system. Previously
operators had to install an entirely separate network for
telecommunications, but integrated cable telephony (RF to the
Kerb/Home) based on transmission of the telephony signals within the
existing network lets the telephony system share the duct, street
cabinets, power and cabling of broadcast services.

Hughes Network Systems has tested its own integrated cable telephony
system, called Cable Telephony Transport System (CTTS), in an
operational environment.

Details are confidential but results are positive. CTTS has performed
well, delivering a reliable telephony service over the HFC network.
Telephony via an HFC network depends on two key subsystems. It
comprises a head end unit installed at or close to the catv head end,
and a number of remote nodes. Each remote node contains at least one
remote interface unit and primary multiplexer and servicing at least 30
subscribers. Concentration can be added to increase the number of lines
carried over the network. At the head end, traffic is presented as EI
(or TI) streams for direct connection, or via further transmission
links, to an exchange switch.

A cross connect facility in the headend enables grooming and
consolidation of traffic carried over the network. A network manager
provides configuration control and status and alarm monitoring. The
remote node is co-located with the catv equipment, usually sited in a
street side cabinet or in the utility room of an appartment. The home
link is made by copper pair to a standard telephone outlet eliminating
installation of equipment in the home.

Alternatively, diplexers can be used to add the telephony signal to the
coaxial drop cable so that no additional wiring is needed. This allows
some 30 to 60 homes to be served by a single remote node. By using
common circuitry the cost is shared over several lines, as opposed to
'RF to the home' where each telephone line has its own dedicated
equipment. RF to the kerb suits medium to high penetration areas
whereas 'RF to the home' is best used where penetration remains low.
Upgrade of the service, adding customers and maintenance, are simple
and quick, virtually eliminating home visits.

System power and backup is controlled by the operator. The system is
also very secure. Only signals designated for a given customer are
delivered to the premises so one customer cannot assume the identity of
another. For the business user, a range of line card types can be
fitted to the PMUX to provide ISDN and other data services. Also the
RIU can be used directly (without the PMUX) to provide 2048kbt/s
service.

And the system provides the infrastructure for interactive services in
the future. With the Hughes system, utilisation of bandwidth is very
efficient and can be configured for either narrow or broadband
services. Later cable modems will offer high performance ethernet over
the cable network providing high speed data communications plus
entertainment services, Internet and general on-line information.

TELLABS DEMONSTRATES REMOTE SERVICE UNIT

Tellabs demonstrated its new single-residence remote service unit (RSU)
for its Cablespan 2300 cable telephony system at ECC '95, delivering
integrated cable television and telephony services over standard
coaxial cable to the subscriber.

Single and multiline versions are available with the initial release
supporting basic telephone services for homes and small business
applications.

Compact design, low power consumption, remote provisioning to speed up
installation and service turn-up, extensive fault locator diagnostics
and ability to accommodate future network services such as ISDN and Lan
to the home are incorporated in the system which is designed to be
fully compatible with international catv and telecom networks.

The RSU enables the Cablespan system to service single home, apartment
block and business catv hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) applications. A key
function of the Cablespan 2300 system is in transforming broadcast CATV
only HFC networks into fully interactive telecommunications networks.

Tellabs Cablespan 2300 telephony over cable system with the RSU is
being used by Viacom Cable to deliver a residential telephone service
over catv for a 200 home trial in Castro Valley, San Francisco, running
from January to June 1996. Integrated catv and telephony including
direct dial local and long distance calling, custom calling and
operator assisted services will be included, and the system can deliver
voice and data services, seamlessly upgrading the existing cable TV
network. Time Warner Communications, Adelphia, Time Warner
Entertainment/Advanced Newhouse and Telewest are also evaluating
Cablespan for cable telephony.

PERSONAL SERVICE SOUGHT

In this fast moving industry, cable operators cannot presume to compete
with the telcos on price alone, so what is available for the cable
operators to enable them to maintain their penetration of the telephony
market? Tony Daniels reports

Telcos are readying themselves for an era of free bandwidth, and it
won't be long before free (or extremely cheap) calls become
commonplace. Even Arno Penzias, vice president of research at Bell
Labs, strikes a cautionary note, "AT&T Telcos should be terrified of
the prospect of free bandwidth. But the answer is change - and change
is coming." The strategy of the cable operators must be to move away
from marketing telephony offerings on price to a value-added service
basis.

UK cable operators offer savings on charges, itemised billing, and the
service advantages of a local network. Industry estimates put the
number of telephone exchange lines installed at 1.2 million, in over 50
regional franchise areas. This compares with 5.8 million broadband
homes passed (1.1 million subscribers), a telephony penetration rate of
20.7 per cent.

Goldman Sachs is a little more conservative, putting the expected
number of cable telephony subscribers by 2000 at 5.1 million (ie 15 per
cent).More value must be offered to meet forecast penetration by the
end of the decade.

The CCA expects cable telephony to increase from 1.3 million lines by
the end of 1995 to 5.7 million lines by the end of 2000, and a
corresponding increase in telephony penetration from 29 to 51 per cent,
with business cable telephony lines to rise from 8 to 12 per cent by
2000 - not much in terms of installed lines, but business-derived
revenue will be significantly higher. Centrex services could provide
small businesses with several advantages, giving callers the impression
of a much larger and efficient organisation. Key features include a
range of call transfer and forwarding options, including 'ring back
when free.'

Bell Cablemedia has taken a lead in developing innovative tariffing and
service packages including call waiting and call barring, with voice
mail following swiftly behind. BT subscribers can get all of these
services - and more besides, but BCM will soon be offering a dual-
number and dual-ringing tone service, so that users can differentiate
an incoming business call from a residential one.

Data is the obvious way that cable companies can capitalise, with fast
file transfer for business users and high-speed Internet connections
for homes. Motorola Multimedia has done significant work on cable
modems and BCM is working on its caller line identification (CLI)
service, including the manufacture of specially branded display
telephone sets. Hughes Network Systems is advocating an integrated
telephony over cable service, which offers full E1 (2Mbit/s) from the
head-end to the curb-side, as opposed to the traditional overlay
network. Telewest trialed the equipment, and has recommended that its
franchisees take up the system.

According to Richard Stevens, business development manager for cable at
Hughes Network Systems, "Telewest is holding back on the level of
deployment until they have more information; they are now testing their
own processes, which in turn will determine operational costs. "At the
head-end there is an E1 interface to the switch, and each networked
switch can support up to 20 remote curb-side nodes, again connected by
E1 lines to a mux card in the cabinet. Such systems enable cable
operators to deliver high speed data, such as file transfer or Internet
access, to the SoHo and residential markets. Although according to
Stevens, "We are likely to see such applications happening in the US
first, with some roll-out in 1996, but real roll-out will not be until
1997."

Personal numbering is still a few years away and subject to regulatory
clearance, but Ericsson is promoting its 'universal personal
telecommunications' service, which is a value-added feature of its
intelligent network switches. The service gives a subscriber a single
number, which he then uses for home, business and mobile purposes.

What is in effect a 'virtual' personal numbering system is available
today from TPS of the UK. Its Personal Assistant value added system
integrates different services, media and equipment under a single
personal number. Subscribers can consolidate their work, home and
mobile phone and fax numbers on one number, managing incoming and
outgoing calls to their own requirements.

It also offers 'find me' call completion, caller screening, fully
featured voicemail, fax store and forward, 'cardless' phone card, and
SMS support. The system knows where you are and when you are available,
and will announce calls so that they can be screened. At any time
during a call, the subscriber can transfer the caller to the voice-mail
service, to be acted upon at a more convenient time. The service is
available to telephony operators as either a service bureau
implementation or a full system sale.

US PREPARES FOR DIGITAL FUTURE

In the face of competition from DBS and DTH satellite services and
impending competition from telcos, North American cable companies now
view digital video compression as a necessity rather than a luxury.

North American viewers only watch 12 to 14 channels but the increased
bandwidth is needed to provide the 'information highway' services and
convergence services that telcos also plan to offer. Rich D'Amato chief
spokesman for the US National Cable Television Association expects
incremental investment of, "About $25 billion (#16 billion) over the
next five to six years to enable cable plant to provide both telephony
and robust video or online services."

Finance is sought for the new services, but the cablecos must be
competitive telecommunications providers, so they are demanding a level
playing field to compete with the telcos. Some states currently allow
cablecos into local telephony and some do not, but there is a
telecommunications bill now in Congress. For two years the spectre of
DBS hitting cable profits has gnawed away at cable's ability to raise
capital. The American cable industry has revenues of $23 billion
yearly, compared to the telcos' $100 billion, so unequal competition
would allow the telcos to swamp cable with their financial clout. Rate
caps were put on US cable prices in 1992.

"Should the legislation be passed,' says D'Amato, you will see cable
operators plan to get into telephony and investment in technologies to
increase capacity and signal quality. Remove regulatory uncertainties
and the bankers will lend money."

The proposed deregulation lifts the rate caps imposed in 1992,
overrides state legislatures and provides for competitive cross-entry.
The White House is not pleased with the thought of lifting cable rate
caps, but wouldn't veto it if it was well supported. It may be passed
this session or held until next year.

Increased capacity is sought by US cablecos to offer consumers a bundle
of services including video, telephony, online access and interactive
services.

"We telephony see as part of our future, carrying us into a leadership
position in telecommunications. It will include video services,
interactivity and access to home banking, shopping, energy management -
the services required from a full service telecommunications provider,"
says D'Amato. "Cable and telephone companies will be offering very
similar services."

Digital video compression will be introduced in 1996, meantime channel
capacity is being increased through fibre deployment. "Channel capacity
and system rebuilds come down to the deployment of fibre and the
addition of digital boxes. Digital boxes come down to manufacturers
producing them in sufficient quantities at affordable prices," says
D'Amato.

TeleCommunications Inc (TCI) is introducing compression on a market by
market basis in mid1996, but other major cable operators are holding
back. Time Warner Cable and Continental Cablevision have adopted a
'wait and see' strategy.

"Digitisation is unquestionably an important trend," says Time Warner
Cable spokesman Mike Luftman. "But we don't have any plans to take any
of our cable systems digital in the near term. Our Orlando Service
Network finds out what digital services people want and we use our
upgraded networks to introduce more analogue cable services, local
telephony and online computer services now. Ultimately a great deal of
TV is going to be digital but we are increasing our analogue capacity
through fibre rebuilds first."

Luftman says that close to 50 per cent or Time Warner, (TW) systems
have been fibred and more than 90 per cent will have been rebuilt by
the year 2000. He points out that while rebuilding with fibre is cost
efficient in urban and suburban areas, smaller operators in rural areas
will probably opt for the introduction of DVC with minimal fibre. "Some
systems in rural areas don't see the payback in fibre rebuilds. For
them digitisation is more important because it will allow them to
deliver more channels in the near future and it is a cost efficient way
to get channel capacity without rebuilding their systems."

For TW, the prospect of bundling services is important. "People will be
presented with at least two choices of providers of bundled services
and being in the market first is a substantial advantage.

"There's no question that cable will get there first because of the
nature our networks" says Luftman. He sees deregulation as providing
opportunities, rather than easing a credit crunch. "We don't have a
capital problem. Deregulation is important because we need access to
telephony through deregulation to gain a fair and competitive playing
field. Telephony is very important. Once you have these upgraded
networks you have this tremendous opportunity. It would be
irresponsible not to take advantage of the opportunity that local
telephone offers. If telephone is going to compete in television then
it is important to get up and compete in their business as soon as
possible."

David Fellows, Continental Cablevision's vice president of technology
and engineering sees it differently, "We are the only major MSO which
has not placed orders for DVC set tops. I want to be within six months
of a real delivery date, to be able to look at a box and kick it and
know what the price is before signing. We will be rolling out digital
compression with the rest, but at the moment we view that as a high end
tier, ten per cent of our customers."

Continental is waiting for the price to come down before going digital.
"Digital boxes seem to be north of $400 for just a decompression box,
not an Orlando full service interactive box. And for $400 I don't think
adding a hundred channels as opposed to 20, is going to pay for them."

Instead, Continental plans to introduce advanced analogue boxes which
permit the use of a virtual channel which can act as an advanced
program guide or a weather or traffic channel.

Through its participation in Primestar, the cable consortium DTH
operator, Continental has concluded that you don't need hundreds of
channels. "We are doing more market testing, but it appears if you have
just ten different movies on with start times every hour, that's good
enough. You don't have to go to start times of every five minutes and a
library of ten thousand titles to get enough revenue to pay for an
analogue box," says Fellows.

Continental is launching an IP0 and applying to various states for
alternative local telephony provider status. 'The pre-emption of state
law by a federal bill would make explaining our plans to analysts
simpler, then we would have to go through a state by state plan.

In Canada deregulation will not finally arrive until local rates are
rebalanced to make local telephony profitable. Long distance charges
curently subsidise local rates. Until the technology arrives and is
installed to permit interconnectivity and number portability, telcos
and cable companies will not be allowed into each other's businesses.

Financial analysts warned the market to avoid Canadian cable operators
due to the threat of DBS and telco competition, but this hasn't
thwarted their ability to raise capital. Colin Watson, president of
Rogers Cablesystems Ltd, Canada's largest MSO says, "The capital market
is certainly adequate. We have managed financings in the US and expect
to continue to do that. There is a lot of regulatory uncertainty on the
issue of cable and telephone competition which I believe has
destabilised the financial markets but it doesn't do anything to the
fundamentals. The informed investor is very enthusiastic about cable."

Rogers has ordered digital set top boxes from General Instrument and
plans to start rolling them out in the third quarter of 1996. Rogers
plans to continue rebuilding its networks until it reaches 625MHz which
is effectively the coming North American standard, providing 90
channels. It plans to use 70 channels for analogue services and 20
channels for DVC at a ratio of 12 to 1, eventually giving it 240
digital channels.

Shaw, Canada's second largest MSO, is building out its systems until
they reach 550MHz. It is in negotiations for digital set top boxes and
plans to start introducing compression in mid-1996.

Rogers' Colin Watson is optimistic. about the potential effect of
digital services on revenue, "There is a relatively flat growth in
traditional cable company revenues but there will be tremendous growth
in revenues from highspeed access for computers and, subsequently,
telephone revenues. Within 10 years new services will provide 50 per
cent of our revenue and that's conservative. "

Michael D'Avella, Shaw's senior vice-president for planning predicts,
"In five years from now new services will provide 30 to40 per cent of
revenues."

Telephony is seen as a 'must have' to compete in the one stop shopping
market beyond 2000, but most American MSOs believe that immediate
growth will come from providing access to online services with
superfast cable modems.

"We already have high speed access in New England and next year we will
start selling the service. Nobody else does it at the speeds we can
offer so you aren't taking a telephone customer and trying to explain
why your dial tone sounds better," says Continental's Fellows.

"Adding in enhanced PPV and revenue from digital services, I think that
in five years, new services might provide 50-60 per cent of revenue,"
says Fellows

He believes these services will migrate from the PC to the TV. "The
companies we are talking to are aimed at the computer and I believe
compelling interactive services will emerge from the PC arena and cut
their teeth there, then versions will be transferred to TV. For home
banking you want a keyboard in front of you."

For many MSOs, digitisation means satellite-proofing. "It means we can
have a service that is much better than any satellite offering," says
Watson, "We will have many many many more channels of PPV, a fully
digitised spectrum and all the local channels."

Cable telephony means increased revenues, but more importantly it lets
cablecos to compete with the telcos as they enter video. Online
services seem poised as cable's great potential in the US. High speed
access is a service cablecos can provide now. "We believe the growth in
PCs and the absolutely astounding interest in gaining access to the
World Wide Web and Internet are the next bonanza in terms of growth
opportunities," says Michael D'Avella.

TIGERS PROWL THE CATV MARKET

Taiwan, one of East Asia's foremost tiger economies, has seen a
plethora of electronics manufacturers enter the cable television
market, supplying many of the oft-overlooked components that keep a
system running. And the government's emphasis on promoting its high
tech industries mean that Taiwan is not just a low cost 'clone product'
maker, but is increasingly conducting its own research and development.

One manufactuerer with a 25 year track record is Trans Electric which
specialises in catv/smatv systems. Its annual sales of over 10,000 catv
headend modulators make the company the dominant Asian supplier. Trans
Electric's PX set top converter is used by half the domestic market and
internationally it has seen sales of over 3.5 million sets.

The company has its own catv technology centre and laboratory in
Taiwan, the first in the country, supporting its research and
development and quality control as well as providing a support and
service centre for its customers. Trans Electric is also the sales
distributor for Philips Magnavox catv distribution products and the
licensed manufacturer of the Zenith addressable scrambling system.

The company portfolio comprises headend equipment; distribution
equipment and subscriber equipment.

Lead Universal International Corporation, with its Chainford
Electronics Company factory, manufactures a broad range of catv parts
and accessories including both passive and active products ranging from
outdoor trunk amplifiers and line extenders to indoor splitters.

Exemplifying the Taiwanese approach to high levels of customer service,
Manager Kennex Huang says, "Our thirteen years in this field have
enabled us to provide high performance reliable equipment with
competitive pricing. We are also competitive on service, with a quick
delivery time of three weeks after receiving payment. Our recently
developed 750 MHz amplifier will be entering production in 1996." The
company produes various types of amplifiers, line extenders, power
inserters/combiners, line splitters, couplers, directional taps, power
supplies and catv connectors.

There are also many tightly focused companies in the market such as
Ding Yih Industrial Co which manufactures catv coaxial cable connectors
and RF coaxial cable connectors suitable for a wide range of cable
types and sizes.

Jack Chang, CEO at Favorlangh Communication Consulting Inc explained
that his company, "Provides specialised market research on retainer or
on a project by project basis,drafting franchise proposals and
evaluating opportunities."

GIVE 'EM A WINCH

Dramatic growth in the installation of fibre optic cable above and
below ground and sub-sea is pushing technological developments with new
products and techniques

In the UK companies such as Energis and Eastern Electricity have been
installing overhead fibre optic cables - ADSS (all dielectric self
supporting cables); OPGW (optical path ground wire) and WRAP (fibre
optic cable wrapped around the earth on transmission towers). CBS
Products noted that most of the existing stringing winches did not have
the necessary tension control required by fibre cables. It designed
tensioners to provide controlled braking via hydraulic variable
controls, and secondary braking through the use of hydraulic disc
brakes.

In any stringing operation a cable pulling bond or rope is first
installed along with running out blocks.

Fibre optic cable installation lengths are long to reduce splicing
which is costly and increases signal loss, but this results in the need
for a fibre puller able to take 5 km of rope. The pullers and tensioner
also need to be versatile to cope with arduous environments.

CBS supplies a range of solutions to meet these demands; trailer
mounted machines with high ground clearance for towing behind all
terrain vehicles to light weight machines that can be manually
transported in inaccessible site locations.

Underground fibre cables are usually installed manually with pulling of
cable by hand, whereas copper communications cables are installed using
small diameter (150 mm) capstan winches that provide large tension
capacities (4000 kg); these winches are then used to pull fibre cables
that require tensions as low as 200 kg.

To protect the cables from over tensioning, a simple fused swivel is
employed by CBS, rated for the maximum allowable cable load. If the
fused swivel breaks mid pull, the ends of the swivel need to be located
and retrieved. The two ends then need to be reconnected before the pull
can recommence. Also, the draw rope is usually left on the ground.

CBS' new winch has integral hydraulic load monitoring pre-set for the
level of pull at which the torque is relieved from the capstan's
hydraulic motor to stop the pull. Tension remains in the cable due to
the number of wraps of draw rope around the capstan. The winch has a
removable rope-take drum. A large diameter (760 mm) capstan allows
greater lengths of installation cable to be wrapped around, allowing a
second winch to assist the pulling winch.

Mid-point pulls, or pulls that have severe changes in direction require
cable figure eighting to ensure the cable does not kink or snag. CBS
has introduced its C-1050 cable fleeters with mid-assist winching,
currently being used in the UK and Malaysia to overcome problems
associated with figure eighting which usually takes up large areas of
pavement, roads, or motorway hard shoulder.

At mid point there is no loose end, so the cable taken off the drum is
looped through a hydraulic cable feeder which takes cable into a
detachable drum at a rate of 100 m per minute, hence it can move 2 km
of cable in 20 minutes.

CUSTOMER DATABASES ALL MAPPED OUT

In Britain Ordnance Survey large scale maps have been essential tools
of the construction sector for more than a century thanks to their
level of detail.

Developments in cost effective GIS and CAD systems generated a national
demand for data that allowed the Ordnance Survey to accelerate its
programme of converting large scale maps to a digital form. Helped by
utility sector customers, the vast task was completed in April 1995.

OS can now produce site centred Superplan plots, the OS's replacement
for traditional large scale maps. Each Superplan Plotting System is
connected via ISDN link to the OS's main database offering on-demand
access to the latest mapping of any part of Great Britain.

A new large scale digital map data product used throughout the cable
and construction industries is OS's Land-Line, used by most local
authorities instead of conventional paper mapping. Land-Line data is
not just used as a screen image, but is increasingly manipulated and
merged with other datasets such as cable or service networks. The
number of plots now being produced for use as working documents or
archive copies means that the volume of mapping in use is increasing
rather than decreasing.

When Land-Line is used with suitable GIS software, linked to one or
more databases, the resulting spatial-data asset management system can
be an efficient way of dealing with large amounts of constantly
changing information.

OS's Address point is another data product suitable for use by the
cable industry, providing a geographical reference for each postal
address in Great Britain. Frequently liked with Land-line, it is
reported to be proving an effective way of geo-referencing a customer
database for purposes as varied as marketing and network growth
planning and fault identification.

Accurate up-to-date data using quality datasets enables efficient and
economic development of existing and potential customer databases.

ENCLOSURES MEET HIGHER SPECIFICATIONS

Six new enclosures were launched by Malcoe at this year's ECC show,
built using Malcolite, a structural foam/aluminium composite, for each
body panel. These light-weight panels are further reinforced by a load
bearing cage incorporated into the panels during manufacture. Benefits
include enhanced physical security, noise insulation, and enhanced
thermal properties. Integrated doors leave a near seamless outline not
cluttered with locks, hinges or flanges. Cable entry can be top or
bottom, and the cabinets are rated to IP*6. The Cablestation
accommodates fibre, cable, cellular and microwave technologies, with
all around access to electronic equipment via front or rear doors.
Internal surfaces including doors can incorporate a slim-line heat
exchanger. Sealed equipment chambers prevent water, dust and pollution
ingress.

Also in the company's product range are: the Norfolk radio base station
with extensive anti-vandal features, sealed thermal chamber, heat
exchanger and removable acoustic cowl; the Leicester accommodates
fibre, copper and coax, suitable for joint Telecoms/catv systems, with
powerful cooling and ventilation systems, and removable thermal
chamber; the Stirling 'cost effective' model has a fixed double skin
for thermal management; and the Hallmark describes a method of
manufacture rather than an actual product, offering a stainless steel
enclosure.

Malcoe's new Telecoms division offers design, configuration and testing
services from enclose selection to site fitting.

FLAG

Work has begun on cable laying for the Fibre Optic Link Around the
Globe (FLAG) - at 27,000 km, the world's longest fibre optic
communications cable, scheduled to run from Europe to the Far East with
landing points in the UK, Spain, Italy, Egypt, the UAE, India,
Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China, Korea and Japan.

Bandwidth transmission capacity will be up to 120,000 digital circuits
at 64/kb/sec, using two fibre pairs each operating at 5 gigabits per
second, and more than 40 carriers have already agreed to purchase
capacity.

Nynex Network Systems is the managing sponsor of FLAG, heading a
consortium of investors from the US, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and
Thailand putting up $1.5 billion capital for the project.

The cable system is being built by AT&T Submarine Systems Inc, and KDD
Submarine Cable Systems of Japan, and is scheduled to go into service
in October 1997.

The cable runs underwater for 26,000 km, linking with existing Pacific
and Atlantic fibre optic cables to span the globe. Primarily intended
for telephony and data, it will also form a faster alternative route to
satellite for video used in special circumstances, allowing live
transcontinental broadcasts to virtually loose their time delay.

STEEL GETS HOT, HOT, HOT

Broadband outside plant managers need to ensure that they specify
enclosures which minimise temperature to reduce chip failure rates says
George Sell, market research and product development at Channell
Commercial Corporation

Heat does affect the performance and reliability of RF amplifiers, but
while amplifier manufacturers have set operating temperature range
specifications, included heat sink features, and provided warranties
covering initial performance, they don't cover heat damage, reliability
and failure rates, and performance over the life of the amplifier
product.

Broadband telecommunications customers assume the life expectancy of RF
amplifiers is longer than the warranty period (typically three years)
with reliability throughout its life. But manufacturers have not
addressed these issues because their customers have not raised them.

Enclosure manufacturers pay lip service to heat dissipation but provide
little evidence for their claims. The operating temperatures of 40oC to
+60oC sets low and high temperature operating extremes, and, short-term
warranties deal with the occasional 'infant mortality' of products
deployed. But these provisions do not address the impact of temperature
on the long-term reliability of RF amplifiers. Neither specifications
(nor warranty coverages) address failure rates over the life of the
product, nor project a life expectancy for the products.

Heat impact on operating performance and life of amplifiers needs to be
measured and here users can turn to extensive testing by the US
Department of Defense (DoD) on integrated circuit performance relative
to heat impacts. The US DoD document MIL-HDBK-217 (MIL-SPECS) provides
a measure of heat impacts on component integrated circuit (IC) chip
failure rates.

MIL-HDBK-217 states that the transistor failure rate doubles for every
9oC (16.2oF) increase in die temperature. This applies at any
temperature and is not a range of threshold. Therefore, the cooler the
operating temperature maintained, the lower the failure rate over the
life of the component IC chips in the RF amplifier. Consequently,
broadband outside plant designer should specify enclosures that best
quantifiably maintain the lowest operating temperatures for the RF
amplifiers they house.

Previous relevant tests include those by broadband system engineers in
Sacramento, California, 1988; enclosure and amplifier product tests
conducted by Channell Commercial Corporation in Temecula, California,
1990; and proprietary field tests of new high frequency amplifier
products conducted by an amplifier manufacturer in Sunnyvale,
California, 1993, employing metal and thermoplastic enclosures.

The Sacramento tests were conducted by the local cable television
system to help decide between Reliable's (now Reltec) traditional metal
enclosures or Channell Commercial's thermoplastic enclosures. Superior
heat dissipation was the criterion.

Test results at the extreme ambient temperature of 38.3oC (101oF)
indicated the coolest reading on the IC chip as 60.6oC (141 oF). or
4.4oC (40oF) over ambient using the Channell CPH1730/500. At the low
temperature extreme of 11.1oC (52oF) ambient, Channell's had the best
showing for IC chip temperature at 37.8oC (100oF), or 8.9oC (48oF) over
ambient. Reliable's had 24.4oC (76oF) over ambient, or 53.3oC (128oF).

In both termperature extremes there was a consistent difference in
temperature on the IC chip, between the results for the Reliable and
Channell enclosures, an increment of about 15.5oC (28oF), with the
Channell enclosure having the best results.

Applying the MIL-HDBK-217 figures, that would mean deploying an RF
amplifier in the Reliable TV-1832/A would increase the predictable
failure rate for the IC chips by nearly three and a half times over the
same amplifier mounted in Channell Commercial's CPH1730/500. And this
differential factor will likely hold true at any temperature within the
specified operating range.

Testing by Channell Commercial in Temecula, California, in 1990 covered
22 different production models of enclosures from four leading
manufacturers and various amplifier models from three leading
manufacturers to gather temperature data on amplifiers, but comparative
data on enclosure heat dissipation was also collected.

The amplifiers tested were: Magnavox 450MHz and 550MHz trunk
amplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders; Scientific Atlanta
450MHz and 550MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders;
Jettold 450 MHz and 550 MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 line extenders.

The enclosure models included in the tests were: Pyramid 1S30.;Moped;
Reliable TV-104, TV-106, TV-1024, TV-1228, TV-1832 and Channell
Commercial CPH1230/STD, CPH1230/500, CHP1730/5TD, CPH1730/500. Data was
recorded by sensors at four locations inside each enclosure's covers
and amplifiers.

Data was collected at thirty minute intervals, twenty-four hours per
day over 30 days. The test data is proprietary but it showed the
superiority of the Channell Commercial enclosure products in terms of
amplifier heat dissipation, especially the 1230 and 1730 units with the
series 500 heat dissipation covers.

The results of the proprietary field tests of new high frequency
amplifier products by a major manufacturer in Sunnyvale, California, in
1993, remain proprietary, however, the test data confirms the data from
the two earlier tests.

Channell thermoplastic enclosures achieve high performance through
their wall thicknesses, louvering, and type and quality of materials
used in their manufacture. And, special heat dissipating covers enhance
performance in severe sun loading conditions. RF amplifier
manufacturers strive for higher frequencies and wider bandwidths,
making the effect of heat dissipation and heat rise on electronics ever
more critical. Amplifiers nominally generate 50 W of heat dissipation,
but worse case parameters easily exceed 100 W.

Field tests show that above 36.7oC (98oF), the heat dissipation
characteristics of Channell Commercial enclosures diverge from the
norm. Other enclosures, especially metal units, track linearly with
increases in ambient temperature, while Channell's track more
positively toward a cooler scale of temperature on the IC Chip. Even if
all other design factors were equal, such as vents and louvers,
attention to convection principles, heat sinking metal bracketry for
amplifier mounting, the amount of free air surrounding the mounted
amplifier etc, the difference between the materials used for
manufacturing enclosures would still be significant. For heat
dissipation, thermoplastic enclosures out-perform metal enclosures.

HDPE MAKES DUCT 'VIRTUALLY INDISTRUCTIBLE'

Behind the glamour world of breaking news and sports finals lies the
ducting that actually carries cable, bringing programmes to viewers
homes.

Priorities here are durablility and ease - hence cost - of
installation. Ducting designed specifically for the catv and
telecommunications industries is supplied by Dura-line who's HDPE Main
Duct System is a total duct solution comprising durable product with
high impact resistance and tensile strength to simplify installation.
It can be buried directly using conventional civils techniques, or
ploughed straight into the ground, even at sub-zero temperatures
without duct shattering; it is also flexible enough to substantially
reduce the need for angled bends.

The company's Silicore Sub Duct comprises a virtually indestructible
HDPE outer with co-extruded permanent lubrication producing an
extremely low coefficient of friction to ensure that even under high
pulling loads, cable and ropes do not burn through the sub duct's walls
and it does not deteriorate or diminish with age. Coil set is totally
eliminated during coiling manufacture when the memory is set in a
permanent straight line - so the sub duct does not coil or corkscrew
when pulled from the drum.

Last year the company opened a manufacturing facility in the UK to
handle the UK demand for main duct and sub-duct products. Advanced
engineering features included in the product range are printing,
striping and colour coding. Other products in the company's portfolio
include customer feeds, speciality duct for fibre optic, underground
chambers, slot boxes, cable pulling lubricants and a range of cable
pulling and sub duct accessories.

Dura-line has recently appointed Cliff Moss, formerly of IBM, as its
managing director.

KNOCK, KNOCK

Mike Shuff interviews a former cable salesman who tells of his
experiences

MS. When did you begin door-to-door cable selling?

Dave. I started in 1993. I was put on a training course, and, by the
end, I was more or less convinced that the company knew what it was
talking about. But, after a few weeks of door knocking, I knew the real
story.

MS. What was the training course like?

Dave. The course ran over five days, We went through everything from
product knowledge to 'dealing with people'; that is, what to say. You
were told to do this and that, but when you actually faced these
situations things turned out different.

MS. What were you told to say to prospective customers?

Dave. We were told that it was going to be a soft sell, hand delivering
glossy literature and then knocking on the door. In some areas, even
the literature drops had not been done. First I had to 're-market' to
areas where most people had already declined the service, so it was
difficult to sell there. In the end, I was mainly selling the phone.

MS. Was the telephone service widely available then?

Dave. No, not in all areas. It was very annoying when you were given a
good sales lead... a prospective customer who had phoned or written
requesting information. The fact that the service was not available
meant that the call was a waste of my selling time.

MS. You were a 'Cable Advisor,' how did you sell?

Dave. Yes. The term 'salesman' was not used. In fact, we were sent to
close the deal. I was told that I should spend no more than 20 minutes
tops on any sales visit before closing. If I was selling the telephone
service, I would knock at the door and come out with something
guaranteed to get attention. "Hello! Do you know the advantages of
being on cable telephone? You only pay for the exact amount of time the
call takes... so you can really save money. Would you like me to go
through your phone bill for you, to show you were you could be saving
money?" which worked better than saying, "I've come to talk about the
benefits of cable." I was never told how it would save money, I just
read the literature.

MS. Who did you approach?

Dave. Generally it was the male owner of the house. On one or two
occasions, I thought that I had closed, only to find I had lost it
because the woman had not been involved.

MS. So its a family decision?

Dave. Yes. The children were also influential, very keen on cable
television because it's new and they can get lots of channels. They can
brag at school "Did you see so and so on cable last night?"; especially
to the kids in their class who don't yet have it.

MS. When were the best times to call?

Dave. We usually called between 6 and 8 o'clock pm. It was difficult to
get both husband and wife together at that time as wives were usually
busy with the domestic routine around dinner. This wasn't recognised by
the compay. They assumed that everybody was at home at this time;
therefore, that was the best time to sell.

MS. Were you encouraged to work outside the set hours?

Dave. Yes. I was working seven days a week. I didn't like working on
Sunday so I would use this day for pre-arranged appointments only, but
plenty of cable advisors were working longer hours, and signing up
exactly the same number of customers.

MS. What was the problem?

Dave. What you've got to accept is, there is no point in calling on
people who genuinely don't want the service. We were just given areas.
You knew almost straight away whether you had got a good area for sales
or a bad, dried-up one. There were certain areas that you knew you were
going to sell very well. A new run in a better quality council estate
was bound to provide a good crop of cable connections, These customers
wanted exactly what cable could offer immediately. Lots of sport, more
channels. films so that they didn't have to rent videos from the shops.
Better off areas simply didn't want catv - they had plenty of other
things to do and were only interested in cheaper telephone services.

MS. Who was interested?

Dave. People who had asked the company for information were generally
professional types wanting to slash large telephone bills. But the
telephone service wasn't always available which prevented me closing
the deal. One time I had sold the whole of a block, but nobody could be
connected because the people who put in the ducts had installed the
wrong type. I got fed-up making excuses for the company.

MS. What was the biggest fault in the marketing plan?

Dave. They did not listen to the actual customers, and tailor cable
services to their needs. Advertising is essential. I would open a
freephone number for anyone wanting to know more about cable. I would
advertise in local newspapers and on the local TV.

MS. What is the average 'life expectancy' of a salesman and how are
they paid?

Dave. Selling life is short. They burn you out. Normally you last
between three and six months. There was a small basic pay, then
commission. In theory, you could earn a lot of money. But salesmen fell
out with their supervisors and were out of a job. I have yet to receive
commission owed.

VOD - DELIVERED

Effective management and analysis of data, whether for programme or
system networks, billing, marketing subscriptions or general finance,
needs dedicated powerfulsoftware applications - and programs for the
catv industry are increasingly available

Wiztec Solutions of Israel has introduced Video on Demand, and plans to
incorporate telephony capability next year in its multilingual cable
subscriber management and billing System (SMS) Wizard.

Wiztek was formed in January from Digital Equipment Company's sale of
its subsidiary DECSys. Its Wizard system includes a complete cable and
satellite TV Infomanagement system for RdB and Oracle databases, and
additional databases in the new year.

Svenka Kezurer of Wiztec adds, "We have also looked at industry video
servers and developed APIs to support a variety of different servers
and any new entrants."

The company already provides Video on Demand billing facilities and is
currently running a pilot billing and customer service scheme for an
interactive games channel. It also plans to be involved in interactive
services. Kezurer explained, "We provide the interface at the entry
point where a customer who wants to use an interactive service first
needs to get authorisation fro the Wiztec database. Afterwards the
systems again interface with the Wiztec system which will provide all
the information on what exactly was provided, how much data was used or
downloaded, and for how long - which would allow charging for Internet
usage on duration used or data transferred. We can set up all kinds of
software to charge according to different services offered and their
different rates."

Kezurer added, "We recognise that telephony is a must in the UK today,
and will provide this capability by the end of next year, aiming at
cable companies providing telephony as a new service."

The company says its flexible approach to tailoring pricing proposals
and payment terms is more adaptable to the diverse norms of the
international market.

Flexibility and openness of the product itself allows the core system
to adapt to growing demands, simplifying maintenance. A $2 million
order for Wizard SMS system software and services for Singapore Cable
Vision (SCV), delivered and running by May 1st after a mid-February
authorisation, is cited as exemplifying Wiztec's flexibility and
ability to stand by a commitment. Randall Coieman, president of SCV
said that the $500 million 30 TV channel and interactive multimedia
services operation chose Wizard for its rich functionality, high level
of support and flexibility of tailoring to requirements.

A Wizard system installed at Telkabel in Austria will enable the
company to offer its 420,000 subscriber base enhanced Pay TV options as
well as PPV and VOD.

REAL-TIME DECISIONS

Cable companies increasingly require real-time information to track
market influencing news stories as they break.

International deregulation is resulting in rapid expansion of cable and
companies with real-time news feeds are best able to capitalise on
emerging opportunities for strategic alliances, mergers and
acquisitions and new services. Real-time data is also used to
streamline company management systems. Tenfore's financial information
service is often integrated with existing software packages. Access to
real-time data such as news stories, foreign exchange rates and stock
market prices allows a quick response to market changes and is
gradually replacing traditional information intermediaries. By setting
specific filters on international news feeds, users are informed of
significant market influencing stories as they break, with time to
digest and act upon them rather than still trawling through the press
cuttings.

Short and medium term cash management can be enhanced by using real-
time financial data on deposit, interbank and forward rates. The
Tenfore system also helps with hedging foreign exchange risk. Forex and
forward prices can be viewed on the PC screen, in a chart or in a
'live' spreadsheet. Tenfore's software allows real-time tracking of
market movements. Global prices can be displayed and real-time ticker
graphs track 'bid', 'ask', 'last trade' or 'volume' according to
requirements.

Users can view real-time and historic data on shares, forex or indices
to present in graphs, spreadsheets or company reports, updatedable in
real-time.

Tenfore subscribers get free use of software for analysing data;
compatibility with other software programmes enables ease of
integration. Live data can be pasted into other Windows compatible
programmes like Exel and Word, updated in real-time.

OPEN SYSTEMS - UP TO A POINT

Information exchange between catv and telco systems, not integration,
is needed says Barco whose Rosa system intefaces with telecom mangement
systems

Minimising downtime and network redundancy are two of the most
important considerations in tele-communications, whereas catv has been
driven by the number of channels, not their quality or availability.
'How else could a customer get all of these programs ?'

But DTH satellites now offer an alternative, while digital DTH and new
high pay interactive services will demand optimum network reliability.
So cable companies must provide an attractive package of programs, plus
services not available via satellite, of excellent quality, and
availability comparable to telephony. Operators have to dramatically
improve their network reliability and quality.

Pre-convergence, Barco developed a catv management concept,
establishing standards for communication between equipment, developing
a propriety protocol supporting communication via normal PSTN lines.

Full Service Networks are now demanded with integration of catv into
Telecom Network Management systems a priority.

The Telecom industry has long been highly regulated with widespread
standard protocols and interfaces for communication between different
systems. Hence adapttation of management concepts with open standard
interfaces to higher level management systems is needed with full
client server architectures, ideally able to interface with non-
proprietary products.

But it does not seem relevant, or economical, to completely integrate
telco and catv systems. More appropriate and feasible is sufficient
integration for information and tasks to be exchanged from one system
to the other. A first step is in-depth monitoring of the headend and
network. This provides the operator with the information required to
respond quickly and efficiently to problems before they are noticed by
the subscriber.

Secondly, backup and rerouting systems need to be established to
increase the network's overall Mean Time Between Failures. Finally,
links to existing Network Management systems and Subscriber Management
systems need to be established to provide accurate management
information and information to customer support for proactive responce
to incoming calls.

Analysing how many people telcos need per 1000 subscribers to obtain
the service they are providing and comparing that with catv, telco
figures turn out to be higher by a factor of 10. Hence catv operators
who want to offer similar services will have to build a similar service
organisation using an efficient tool to manage this workforce and
minimising operational costs.

Barco's ROSA (RCDS Open Systems Architecture) system is designed to
fulfil this function. Starting with its FSM860 Headend Supervisor,
Barco has supplied monitoring and management tools for catv headends
and networks. All existing RF products have been equipped with
monitoring and remote control interfaces and all new units have a
serial control bus (Remote Control and Diagnostic System bus - RCDS)
allowing full remote control and automatic configuration.

The RCDS protocol was especially developed to configure and manage
hardware equipment in a catv environment making them easier and less
expensive to integrate into a management system. ROSA provides self-
healing capabilities, system performance testing and statistical
information to optimise operations and maintenance workforce.

A user-friendly GUI allows the user to define his own windows and views
on the information present in the system. The open architecture of the
database allows access by other systems via ODBC .

The ROSA system can be used as a powerful stand-alone management tool,
and as an intelligent element manager able to interface with overall
Telecom Network Management systems at different levels. ROSA also
provides the redundancy level needed for the headend to be competitive
with availability figures reached by Telecom switches. ROSA handles
multiple headends, distribution nodes and catv networks. For
communication between the sites and a Central Management Centre ROSA
supports X25, X31, ISDN, PSTN and other connections. Its modular
approach allows gradual integration into the CATV system.

GLOBAL DATA ACCESS

Building on its core database expertise, Oracle now provides
applications for specific catv industry sytem requirements

A key to cable operators increasing penetration figures is developing
billing and financial management systems which can turn customer
activity into revenue streams so cable operators should review their
information technology infrastructures now.

Oracl, which started as a developer of relational database software,
now provides information management tools forming the backbone of
applications for billing, subscriber management, financial management,
human resources and data warehousing (extracting information from a
variety of other systems and putting it onto one large database that
everybody can access).It also provides applications to help cable
operators proactively identify new areas of opportunity and broaden the
range of services they offer.

Customer account history is analysed in minute detail to build up
customer profiles and steer marketing and customer service activity,
helping build longer-lasting and more profitable customer
relationships.

Ocacle's multimedia and World-Wide Web products enable it to provide
cable operators with a new range of commercial services, and is working
with telcoms operators worldwide to test and deploy interactive and on
demand services. Oracle is helping create information warehouses that
can manage, store and organise all the multimedia data for these
services, and its media servers support millions of clients and a host
of consumer devices.

Telecommunications-related activity now accounts for 23 per cent of
Oracle's US $3 billion world-wide turnover and its dedicated team of
more than 130 telecoms consultants now service every major cable
operator in the UK. Oracle recently supplied a suite of financial
applications including stock control, purchasing and foreign currency
management to Telewest Group, UK. For Bell Cable Media, Oracle is
putting in a financial suite to manage its UK franchises and an inter-
admin accounting system to manage wholesale retail telecommunications
traffic by different interconnect partners.

Birmingham Cable's new subscriber management and billing system is
based on Oracle technology. And Nynex, whose key supplier for billing
systems is IBM, made substantial purchases of Oracle technology last
year to deploy across all its UK franchises.

Oracle provided staff to see what the cable operators wanted, then
developed a technology approach responsive to the individual and
rapidly changing needs and goals of its potential client base.

NETWORK TRANSMISSION ENHANCED

The Harmonic Lightwaves HL 5000 series network management system
developed to enhance network transmission performance and subscriber
satisfaction will continuously and automatically poll up to 500 network
elements, displaying status on screen, with immediate problem
identification and alarm for early trouble shooting.

Colour coded indicators allow operators to dispatch service technicians
directly to trouble sites, so minimising down-time. Background polling
is constant with logging of performance history time and date stamped
for analysis of recurring problem areas, forecasting of service
requirements and planning preventative maintenance.

Four screen levels lead the user through problem identification; first
screen - complete system overview; second - zoom in on selected
network; third - digital or alarm level view of the chosen equipment;
fourth - the analogue or parameter level indicators of the selected
hardware. After problem identification and location the operator can
restore the system. Components in an NMS 5000 system are: software,
computer, transponder, and serial port interface. Advantages include
real-tie system management, control and monitoring at the headend or
hub, instant access to system status; performance logging; malfunction
pinpointing; layered software; secure remote monitoring and
troubleshooting and ability to drive alarms and third party interfaces.

RISK MANAGEMENT PAYS DIVIDENDS

Customer analysis and profiling reduces bad debt and can also
facilitate packaged marketing, fostering customer loyalty

It is critical for cable operators to get a fast return on investment,
hence whatever the technology, territory or sales environment, the key
business areas of marketing and risk management play a key role in
achieving this objective.

The pressure to recruit new subscribers should be balanced with a
realistic view of risk management. Return on investment and
profitability also relys on customers using the service and paying
their bills.

In areas where the licence requirement is to offer the service to all
in franchised areas, door-to-door is a logical means of achieving
blanket coverage. Moreover, it is a tried and tested tactic in the US
and represents proven experience which MSO's apply in new territories,
with telemarketing and direct mail as a support tactic. It is a key
requirement to target activity appropriately. Both catv and telephony
may be viewed by operators as mass services within concentrated
geographical areas, the method of marketing varies according to
different user groups as families young people and senior citizens view
the same services very differently.

Different targetting tools are used to achieve different objectives.
Area Analysis - understanding the territories in which operators work -
is critical for both engineering and sales/marketing activity. These
areas include franchises, nodes and sales territories, all of which
drive build and sales initiatives. Cable operators use geo-demographic
data alongside post office and local authority data. Many UK operators
use CCN's Mosaic to classify individual postcodes as neighbourhood
types. The analysis entails reporting and mapping; mapping can be
undertaken within the Mosaic software and, for more detailed
definition, within operators' own geographic information systems (GIS).

Customer analysis and communication: understanding the profile of
customers is vitally important to operators if they are to provide the
best service and to foster loyalty. The analysis of customer behaviour
(ie service take-up, payment history, attitude to service etc) is
undertaken using operators' own data as well as external data such as
Mosaic. Resulting analysis is used to target direct response (mail or
phone), direct sales activity and to provide management information.
CCN has designed an appropriate PC database package specifically for
use by cable companies.

After identifying customer types most appropriate for cable services,
sales and marketing activity is initiated. Risks attached to taking on
new business include - will the applicant pay? Is the applicant who
they say they are? As cable develops there is increased risk of
consumers swapping suppliers and of fraudulent activity. With swapping,
there is the temptation to run up a bill with one supplier before
defaulting and moving to another (eg BT to cable). There is also a
growing threat from serious fraudsters using features such as three-way
calling to divert calls internationally in call selling operations
which never pay service bills.

Operators check creditworthiness using their own proof of identity
procedures as well as credit referencing techniques supplied by
agencies such as CNN.

Isuses and solutions involved include: application risk assessment
where potential customers wishing to apply for service are credit
checked using Credit Referencing Agency (CRA) data. Scorecards used to
assess applications range from generic designs such as CCN's Delphi
through to bespoke cards designed to incoprorate the operators own
poliices.

Application processing entails capturing the details of an applicant,
applying the scorecard and delivering the result for installation
action to create an efficient customer service. Systems such as CCN's
autoscore incorporate the individual requirements of each client.

Previous fraudulent activity is one of the best warning signs for
avoiding or intercepting the risk of fraud. CCN's Detect compares
existing and previous credit applications to identify inconsistencies
which may signal a potential fraud. The credit industry fraud avoidance
scheme (CIFAS) is another initiative which enables its members to share
information that is useful in identifying potential frauds, which
operators access through their CRA.

Once a history of customer behaviour has been built, further risk
scoring can be based on real experience. 'Behavioural scoring' allows
operators to identify customers for PPC or value added services.

CCN's international network operates marketing systems, CRA bureau
facilities and scoring services according to the data available in each
territory.

This flexibility enables key business issues to be addressed regardless
of the environment.

Operators have an opportunity to gain competitive advantage by making
full use of the technology and software available to the cable industry
to manage their marketing, risk and ultimately, profitability to
maximum effect.
