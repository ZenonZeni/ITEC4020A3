<h1>Preface</h1><P>
<HR>

This manual has been created in response to the needs expressed by many
varying exceptionalities(VE) teachers in Florida.  Over the past 20 years, the
use of the varying exceptionalities delivery model has increased.  Various task
forces have been formed to examine the issues and concerns and to recommend
practices and policies to ensure appropriate uses of the model. <P>

In 1991, representatives from the Florida Teaching Profession/National
Education Association (FTP/NEA) urged the Department of Education to review the
current policies and practices.  Surveys and interviews were used to gather
input from VE teachers from 17 school districts over two years.<P>  

This manual<i>, Resources for VE Teachers, </i>was developed at the
recommendations of the advisory group formed in response to the FTP/NEA
inquiry.  It is intended to provide information about the use of the VE model
in Florida and to share classroom practices that teachers have found to be
successful.  In Fall, 1992, VE teachers were asked to submit ideas for
inclusion in this manual.  The members of the writing team that met in Spring,
1993. provided valuable input and insight into the contents of this manual and
their special contributions are gratefully acknowledged.  Debbie Houston,
Program Specialist in the Bureau for Education of Exceptional Students, and her
secretary, Myra Orange, also deserve recognition for their facilitation of this
entire effort.<P>
