<h3>When does ANTWGG meet and what does it do?</h3>  
     The working group meets  formally twice a year at the N.S.F. building in Arlington, Virginia.  Meetings are typically for a day and a half.  Agenda items are those suggested either by OPP or  by members of the working group.   We welcome, however , suggestions to enhance effectiveness  of OPP projects and logistics base from the earth science community, and we seek input on some topics currently under discussion.  Topics that will be on the next agenda meeting include:

<li>     Update on marine corting capability and formation of a study group
<li>      Potential use of the Nathanial B. Palmer as a platform for land-based 	geology
