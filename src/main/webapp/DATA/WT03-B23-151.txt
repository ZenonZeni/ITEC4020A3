<P>
There is a classification of securities that represent an ownership
interest in mortgage loans made by financial institutions. The
most popular type of these mortgage-backed securities, known as
&quot;pass-throughs&quot; or participation certificates, are issued
by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal
National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). You probably know them by their
nicknames, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Since GNMA
is an agency of the federal government, the interest and principal
payments are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government. FNMA and FHLMC are <A HREF="bondgse.htm">Government Sponsored Enterprises</A> (GSEs) and, like other GSEs, are imbued with an indirect
backing of the U.S. government. Thus, the chances of default are
negligible at worst and more likely nonexistent.

<P>
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase high-quality residential
mortgages from lenders, package them into mortgage pools and then
sell partial interest in the pools to investors in the form of
mortgage-backed bonds. Like bonds, these securities pay interest,
but they pay it monthly rather than semiannually, an important
feature if you need or want monthly income. Perhaps the greatest
difference is that investors in mortgage-backed securities receive
not only monthly interest payments, but also a partial repayment
of their principal. As with any mortgage loan, mortgage-backed
securities will reflect a changing proportion of interest to principal
over the life of the bond. Interest payments are usually received
early in the life of the bond and heavier principal repayments
are received as the bonds become more seasoned. Since interest
payments are fully taxable at the federal, state and local levels
and principal repayments are not, someone in a high tax bracket
may prefer an older issue that has a higher portion of principal
repayments to the taxable interest payments. Because mortgage-backed
bondholders receive both interest and principal repayments, long-term
investors need to have a clear-cut plan for reinvesting at least
the principal amount of their mortgage-backed bond payments each
month. Otherwise, they could be spending their principal.

		<P>
				Mortgage securities are often priced at a higher yield than Treasury
				and corporate bonds and, therefore, their opportunities for profit
				and loss are also greater.  As with any other type of fixed-income
				security, mortgage-backed securities can be sold at par or at 
				a premium or a discount to their face value prior to maturity
				in a large secondary market, depending on changes in interest
				rates. When interest rates rise, prices fall, and vice versa. Interest 
				rate changes have an additional impact on mortgage securities
				because they affect the prepayment rate and, subsequently, the	
				yield. When interest rates decline, prepayments will increase
				beyond the initial pricing assumptions, which could cause the
				average life and expected maturity period to shorten. In addition,
				the principal may have to be invested at a lower interest rate
				than the initial coupon of the security. Conversely, when interest
				rates rise, prepayments slow down and could cause the average
				life and maturity period to lengthen and the market value to decline.
		<P>
				Because mortgage securities have different characteristics than
				other fixed-income securities, investors should discuss the features, risks 
				and expected performance of the securities under varying market
				conditions with their Investment Executive.
