<CENTER><H3><B>IDEA Reauthorization Process Has Ended for the 104th Congress
</H3><BR></B> </center>


Reston, VA -- All further consideration of the reauthorization of IDEA has now come to
an end for this Congress.  A formal statement to that effect has been issued by Sen.
William Frist (R-Tenn.), chair of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy,
dated September 30, 1996 (see below). <P>

CEC appreciates the Congress declining to take final action on this complex
reauthorization, given the fact that insufficient time remained for a careful and thorough
preparation of a final House/Senate bill.  CEC observes that as far back as July 4, all
parties concurred that time had even then nearly run out, since it was estimated that a
minimum of six weeks was needed to resolve differences between the two bills in a
House/Senate conference. <P>

For their leadership throughout the reauthorization process, CEC wishes to express
deep gratitude to both the House and Senate chairs and ranking members, in the
Senate most especially Sen. Frist, Sen. Tom Harkin, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, Sen. Ted
Kennedy, and the majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott; in the House, Rep. Randy
Cunningham, Rep. William Goodling, and Rep. Dale Kildee.  Further, many other
members in both Chambers made significant positive contributions to whom we will
express our thanks. Also, CEC expresses its sincere thanks to key staff, both majority
and minority, on both sides of the Hill for their tireless efforts in a most difficult
reauthorization process.  Our best way of thanking you will be our determination to pitch
in and assist you in the 105th Congress. <P>

Following is Senator Frist's statement:<P>

<H3>IDEA REAUTHORIZATION DIES AS CONGRESS ADJOURNS FOR YEAR</h3>

WASHINGTON, DC -- For the last year-and-a-half, I have worked closely with
Congressional Republicans and Democrats, as well as disability organizations and
education groups, to create a comprehensive reauthorization of the 21-year-old
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  What emerged was a compromise
bill that took a giant leap forward in easing educators' bureaucratic nightmares and
financial burdens while preserving the right to a free, appropriate public education for
our children with disabilities.  In striking such a delicate balance, this compromise would
have ensured that our children with disabilities' needs would be met and that our
educators could do what they do best -- teach our children and expand their
horizons.<P>
     
But as time began to run out for the 104th Congress, there were some obstacles that
we just could not overcome. While I am disappointed that we couldn't bring IDEA to the
Senate floor before the close of the session, I hope that the common-sense changes in
the IDEA Amendments of 1996 will serve as a foundation for future efforts.<P>

Thank you.<P>
     
United States Senator Bill Frist <P>
