<H1>Grand Banks, Newfoundland</H1>
<H3> Introduction</H3>
Canadian Marconi Company and Quinlan Brothers Seafoods invited Quester Tangent to install and operate the QTC VIEW aboard a working scallop dragger. The purpose was to identify scallop beds using digital seabed classification on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada.<P>
<H3>Equipment</H3>
The QTC VIEW was installed on the bridge of the 22 m scallop dragger M.V. Cape Aaron. The system was connected to the 200 kHz transducer of a SI-TEX dual frequency 200/50 kHz echo sounder. A 486 DX2-66 MHz laptop computer displayed and stored data. Navigation information supplied by the vessel’s GPS, was logged in NMEA 0183 GGA, GLL formats.<P>
<H3>Area</H3>
Situated at the toe of the Grand Banks, Lilly Canyon has a water depth range between 90 and 2000 m. Scallops were located near the head of the canyon (90 -150 m) and were associated with a substrate of sand, cobbles and bedrock bordered by finer sediments containing sand dollars.<P>
<H3>Calibration</H3>
Sample echoes were collected at three sites enabling the system to recognize seabed types during the survey. The vessel’s drag was used for ground-truthing at the sites. The first site (water depth 100 m) consisted of gravel and cobbles. The second site (water depth 110 m) consisted of fine sands containing sand dollars. The third site (water depth 170 m) consisted of sands with scallops, starfish and crab. <P>
<H3>Results</H3>
The vessel shot its drag and proceeded to fish in a north/south direction in moderate seas with heavy chop. A drag speed of one to two knots was maintained. The QTC VIEW provided the vessel with a good visual picture of the scallop bed boundaries (Figure 1). The grounds were oriented parallel to depth contours. The zone of high productivity was narrower to the north with seabeds of sand dollars to each side.<P>
It was important for the scallop dragger to avoid sand dollars to  minimize bycatch. The QTC VIEW's track plot was used to steer the vessel over the areas of highest productivity, including the narrow part of the scallop zone.<P>

<H3>Summary</H3>
The QTC VIEW demonstrated digital seabed classification is an effective tool for the scallop fishery. By training the system to identify seabeds containing target species, the QTC VIEW maximized the harvest and minimized bycatch. <P>
