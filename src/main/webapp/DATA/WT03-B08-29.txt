Mid-IR Laser
Likes it Warm

A team of scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory and the
University of Houston Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) has
developed a mid-infrared solid-state laser that operates at near
room temperature.

According to Shin-Shem Steven Pei, SVEC's associate director for
research (Tel: 713/ 743-3621, E-mail: spei@uh.edu), lasing was
observed at temperatures up to 285K. "This is by far the highest
operating temperature for an interband transition laser at this
wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device that works with a
compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy cryogenic
system, and room-temperature operation is just around the corner."

The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-II
quantum-well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4
microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVEC
and then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing the
material growth and device design for diode lasers that can produce
sufficient power at 3 to 5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVEC
scientists are also testing a more advanced quantum-cascade laser
design, which should produce higher-intensity light with less
electric current while emitting within either of two atmospheric
transmission windows of 3 to 5 microns and 8 to 12 microns.

Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,
medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicle
and air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covert
illumination for night vision, free-space communications, and IR
countermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly in
these windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.
This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse-
gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical process
control, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IR
systems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compact
IR sources are available.

The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at much
shorter wavelengths. Long-distance telephone networks use 1.3 and
1.5 micron lasers in their optical fiber systems, and a 0.8 micron
beam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible light
ranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readily
absorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmission
windows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within the
windows are too bulky and expensive for most commercial
applications.

InGaN LEDs with
Quantum Wells

Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd. (Dept. Of R&D,
491 Oka, Kaminaka, Anan, Tokushima 774, Japan), in a paper
presented at the Materials Research Society's Fall Meeting,
reported the successful growth of high-power blue, green, and
yellow light-emitting diodes with quantum-well structures.  The
devices are based on III-V nitrides and were grown by metalorganic
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on sapphire substrates.

The single quantum-well (SQW) structured LEDs are described in
contrast to InGaN/AlGaN double-heterostructure devices.  The latter
produce high-power output in the blue and blue-green regions with
a broad emission spectrum represented by a full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of 70 nm and output power over 1 mW.

The SQW LEDs feature a thin InGaN active layer, from which a high-
power emission with a narrow emission spectrum is obtained.
Typical FWHM for green LEDs of this type is 45 nm, 20 nm from blue
devices, and 90 nm from yellow devices.  Power output from the same
LEDs were 1 mW, 4 mW, and 0.5 mW respectively, all at 20
milliamperes.  The drop in output power with the emission
wavelength increase from blue to yellow was noted.

One primary goal of the research was to improve the performance of
green LEDs.  Those made from GaP and AlInGaP exhibit emission
wavelengths of 555 and 570 nm and external quantum efficiencies of
0.1% and 1% respectively.  The SQW LED described by Nakamura
achieved a quantum efficiency of 2.1% at a peak wavelength of 525
nm, a pure green emission.  The 555 and 570 nm emissions are
described as yellowish green.

InGaAs Photodetectors
Set a Record

A record low dark-current operation of InGaAs (1.55 micron) p-I-n
Photodetectors on silicon and GaAs has been reported in Applied
Physics Letters.  The authors, led by F. E. Ejeckan (School of
Electrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853; E-
mail: felix@ee.cornell.edu), fabricated the photo conductors by
first bonding the p-I-n epitaxial layers, followed by chemical
removal of the host InP substrate from the p-I-n structure, after
which the photodetector was fabricated on top of the exposed p-I-n
layers.

Bonding of the photodetector to the substrate is done as efforts at
heteroepitaxial growth have not met with success due to the
inherent material defects present in devices grown by this method.
Bonding eliminates these material defects, but the films often are
mechanically weak and thermally unstable.  The technique employed
by the authors of bonding by atomic rearrangement (BAR) avoids this
weakness and obtains a covalently bonded interface free of defects
other than crystallographic misfit.

Under 5 volt reverse bias, dark currents down to 57 pA on GaAs and
290 nA on Si were measured.  A external quantum efficiency of 80%
was deduced from the responsivity at 1.55 microns of 1 A/W, and the
series resistance across the bonded interface was 17 ohms for GaAs
and 350 ohms for Si.

Low-Temperature
Growth Method

A chemist at Washington University (St. Louis, MO 63130) has
discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals at
temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the first
to use solution-phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sized
crystals of indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and
indium arsenide (InAs) at low temperature.  The semiconductors made
by the new method may be used in devices such as light-emitting
diode displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc
players, and computer components.  The breakthrough offers
intriguing possibilities for developing integrated devices
consisting of semiconductors and polymers, plastics, or composites.

Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combining
other materials with the semiconductors because of the very high
temperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currently
produced at temperatures of 500 oC-1,200 oC, but the method William
E. Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, E-mail: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu),
associate professor of chemistry, has discovered allows growth at
200 oC.  Buhro's technique, the solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth
method, is similar to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) gas-phase growth
method that has been used for some 30 years.

Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by the
nonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which do
not allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at low
temperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium and
indium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are the
sites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds InP, GaAs, and
InAs (type III-V semiconductors) nucleate and grow.

Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solid
mechanism, a three-phase system where the chemistry occurs in
solution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited into
the liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizes
out as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is to
turn down the heat on solid-state synthesis.  This new method
expands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.

Optical AND Gate in
Ge-Doped Silica Guide

An all-optical programmable AND gate has been fabricated in a
germanium-doped silica waveguide (P.M. Ranon, Air Force Technical
Applications Center/TXO, 1030 S. Highway A1A, Patrick Air Force
Base, FL 32925; E-mail: pmranon@crusher.aftac.gov).  The gate
consists of the Ge-doped silica planar waveguide, a Q-switched and
a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser and coupling two fundamental frequency
beams into different guiding modes of the waveguide along with a
second harmonic beam coupled into one guiding mode.

The waves interfere in the guide, generating a set of semi-
permanent second-order susceptibility gratings that generate second
harmonic light.  When optically programmed, the second harmonic
light behaves as an output of an AND gate with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 17 dB.

The waveguide was produced by ion-beam sputtering of silica and
germanium (6 atomic %) onto an optical grade silica substrate to a
thickness of 2.0 microns.  Indices of refraction were 1.532 and
1.546 at the fundamental (1064 nm) and second harmonic wavelengths
(532 nm), respectively.  The second harmonic of the film had  an
output of 150 mW.  This type of gate is expected to be able to be
extended to other logic functions, with an electronic NOT gate
possibly forming a complete set.

Room Temperature Si
High-Vacuum Bonding

Bonding of 4-inch silicon wafers has been done at room temperature
in ultrahigh vacuum conditions.  After local initiation of the
process, it is essentially self-propagating, with resultant bonded
wafers having bulk-like properties.  According to U. Gosele (Max
Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics, Weinberg 2, D-06120
Halle, Germany; E-mail: goesele@mpi-msp-halle.de), this is in
contrast to the current technological process, which requires
heating to 700oC to reach the required bonding strength.

Commercially available 4-inch (100 mm) Si wafers were etched in
dilute HF to remove the oxide and to make the surfaces hydrophobic.
Two wafers were bonded in a microcleanroom set up at room
temperature and then transferred to an UHV chamber that was pumped
down to 3x10-9 Torr.  The wafers were separated, and the residual
hydrogen volatilized by raising the chamber temperature to 600oC-
800oC.  After cooling to room temperature, the wafers were rebonded
with an estimated bonding speed of greater than 1 m/sec, in
contrast to the bonding speed in atmospheric conditions of 0.01
m/sec.  High-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed the
bonded interface to lack any defects aside from the unavoidable
crystalline mismatch at the interface.

Thermal Annealing
Improvements in GaN

Rapid thermal annealing of GaN in argon or nitrogen at temperatures
up to 1100oC has been shown to improve surface morphology and
photoluminescence in Applied Physics Letters.  Atomic force
microscopy characterization, done by a group led by J. C. Zolper
(Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0603; E-mail:
jczolpe@somnet.sandia.gov), showed the average root mean square
surface roughness to decrease from about 4 nm to about 1 nm after
annealing at 1100oC.  Band-edge luminescence intensity was
increased by a up to a factor of four after a 1100oC anneal, which
improves the ratio of the band edge to deep-level luminescence and
also reduces the electron concentration and mobility.

These developments will enhance GaN-InN-AlN materials technology,
with which a number of improved electronic and photonic devices
have been developed.  Reduction in  the electron mobility can be
explained in terms of  two-band conduction mechanism or an
increased compensation ratio.  The improvement in surface roughness
might be attributed to quenching of the high-temperature surface
state, but more work is required to explain the mechanism behind
the improved photoluminescence of GaN with thermal annealing.

Spire Wins Contract to
Push GaAs Technology

Spire Corp. (1 Patriots Park, Bedford, MA 01730-2396; Tel: 617/275-
6000, Fax: 617/275-7470) announced earlier this month the receipt
of a contract from the Naval Research Laboratory for the continued
development of gallium arsenide (GaAs) monolithic complementary
heterojunction bipolar transistor (CHBT) push-pull power amplifiers
and operational amplifiers.  Power amplifiers have applications in
phased-array radar and mobile phone communications, while
operational amplifiers are used broadly in analog electronics that
require high-speed analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
converters.

The company will use selective metalorganic chemical vapor-
deposition techniques to integrate both Npn and Pnp HBTs on one
wafer in a planer topography. Pascale Gouker, manager of
Microelectronic Structures at Spire, said that though the research
will be done on 2-inch GaAs wafers, 4-inch wafers will eventually
be qualified for use by the developed technology.

Heat Treatment for
PTCR Barium Titanate

Semiconducting barium titanate (BaTiO3) is of interest for a
variety of applications but is difficult to manufacture due to the
necessity of preferential distribution of dopants in the titanate
grains and the sensitivity of the positive temperature coefficient
of resistance (PTCR) performance to the heat-treatment schedule
used to sinter the microstructure of these electronic ceramics.
Prof. Vasantha Amarakoon at Alfred University (New York State
College of Ceramics, Alfred, NY 14802; Tel: 607/871-2497) reports
in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society  the effects of heat
treatment on PTCR behavior.

The PTCR behavior occurs as a result of either doping BaTiO3 with
an aliovalent ion or heating in a low-oxygen atmosphere that
reduces Ti4+ to Ti3+.  Electronic conduction occurs up to the Curie
temperature (about 120oC) where the resistance increases by several
orders of magnitude.  The necessity of achieving uniform
distribution of liquid-phase additives (excess barium, tin) is
dealt with by using a gel-coating process of the grains.  The PTCR
effect is seen to develop when the material is cooled to the
annealing temperature, as the grain boundaries rapidly oxidize when
the liquid phase there solidifies.  Oxygen diffusion continues
during annealing and cooling, which increases the PTCR response.

11.4 MHz Transmission
Ultrasonic Transducer

Surface micromachining of gold-coated, nitrided, oxidized, highly
doped p-type (100) silicon has been used to fabricate novel
capacitive, ultrasonic air transducers at 11.4, 9.2, and 3.1 MHz.
The transducers consist of circular silicon nitride membranes
suspended above the heavily doped silicon.  Electrostatic forces
attracting the membrane towards the Si are resisted by stresses in
the membrane when a voltage is applied, so the membrane returns to
its original position when a voltage oscillation is switched.  Igal
Ladabaum (E. L. Ginzton Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford,
CA 94305; E-mail: igal@leland.stanford.edu) and coworkers report in
Applied Physics Letters  that their devices have a bandwidth range
of 5-20%.

Detection of 10 MHz capacitance fluctuations as small as 10-18
farads can be made, corresponding to displacements on the order of
10-3 Angstroms in a bandwidth of 2 MHz and a signal-to-noise ratio
of 20 dB.  The detection sensitivities obtained can withstand more
than 100 dB of signal attenuation, which makes these devices of
interest for ultrasonic imaging, nondestructive evaluation, gas-
flow and composition measurements, and range sensing.  These
properties are a marked improvement over piezoelectrics for air
applications that suffer from a six-order-of-magnitude difference
in acoustic impedances between air and piezoelectrics.

AT&T Dials Up New
Way to Passivate GaAs

AT&T IPM Corp. was issued U.S. Patent 5,464,664 on Nov. 11, 1995,
for a downstream ammonia plasma gallium arsenide (GaAs) passivation
technique that claims fast, stable, room-temperature operation.
The inventors are Eray S. Aydil, Konstantinos P. Giapis, and
Richard A. Gottscho.

A workpiece with an exposed GaAs surface is passivated by placing
the workpiece in an evacuated chamber and generating an ammonia
plasma between 10 and 30 cm from the workpiece and  causing the
plasma products to flow downstream into contact with the workpiece.
The plasma gas pressure is held between 0.5 to 6.0 Torr, and the
exposure time should be sufficient to increase the
photoluminescence intensity of the gallium arsenide by at least a
factor of 10, which is said to be more than five minutes.

Though the patent abstract specifies a  substrate temperature of
less than 100oC, it also specifically states that the process can
be done at room temperature.  The workpiece should also not be
placed within line-of-sight of the plasma to avoid UV, visible, and
x-ray radiation-induced damage for a time sufficient to increase
photoluminescence intensity from said gallium arsenide by at least
a factor of 10.

Diffusion Barrier
Method Patented

AT&T was issued U.S. Patent 5,468,689 on Nov. 21, 1995, for a
method for preparing a silicon nitride gallium diffusion barrier
for use in molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide.
The inventors are John E. Cunningham, Keith W. Goossen, William Y.
Jan, and James A. Walker.

The technique involves reacting nitrogen and silane in a ratio of
less than 300:1 in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor-deposition
apparatus to form a silicon nitride layer.  This layer is deposited
on a reflowable glass layer previously deposited on a (100) silicon
substrate oriented 3 degrees off axis and bearing a thin film of
silicon dioxide.  Finally, GaAs is deposited by molecular beam
epitaxial growth on the silicon nitride layer.  The technique is
said to be of interest for use in the monolithic integration of
interconnected GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructures, modulators, and
silicon MOSFET structures.

Hughes Develops
Improved HEMTs

Hughes Aircraft Co. was issued U.S. Patent 5,471,077 on Nov. 28,
1995, for a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) and a method
for its fabrication.  The inventor is Marko Sokolich.  Improvement
in the device results from alloying the diffusion layer.

The resulting HEMT includes a diffusion barrier, made of titanium
nitride, that prevents gate-metal diffusion into the substrate
during fabrication and a sacrificial platinum alloy layer that
forms the Schottky barrier.  The titanium nitride layer is formed
on a platinum layer, and sufficient heat is applied to cause the
platinum layer to alloy with the gallium arsenide layer forming a
platinum gallium and a platinum arsenide alloy layer and Schottky
barrier.

All the platinum is consumed in this method, so precise control of
the thickness of the gate layer is achieved, and diffusion of the
platinum gate layer into the gallium arsenide layer during later
processing steps is eliminated.

Hg-Based Superconductors
Challenge Researchers

A paper presented by Paul Chu et al (The Texas Center for
Superconductivity and Dept. Of Physics, University of Houston,
Houston, TX 77204; Tel: 713/743-8212) at the fall meeting of the
Materials Research Society focused on research underway on mercury-
based high-temperature superconductors, the homologue series,
HgBa2Can-1CunO2n+2+d [Hg-12(n-1)n or HBCCO] with n = 1, 2, ...7.

They were first found by a Swiss team in Zurich to be
superconducting at temperatures up to 134K.  Later, the Houston
group raised the superconducting temperatures of these compounds to
a record-high temperature of 164K by squeezing the sample, making
it possible for the first time to achieve the superconducting state
by the use of household air-conditioning technology.

These materials exhibit an impressive current-carrying capacity of
up to 1 million amperes per square centimeter at 100K, observed by
the IBM group at Yorktown Heights after making the compound into
the thin-film form.  The figures translate to a theoretical limit
of about 10 million amperes per square centimeter at the liquid-
nitrogen temperature of 77K.

Chu said that because of the simple and subtle crystal structure of
the compounds, specifically the linear Hg-O coordination that
allows a large cation-doping range, scientists are given the
opportunity to peer into the effects of atomic arrangement and
doping on the occurrence of superconductivity at high temperatures.

Some of the experimental results on these compounds have
demonstrated the limits of and the modifications needed in some of
the prevailing models of high-temperature superconductivity.  A
superconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID) was made from
this compound and operated at the unprecedentedly high temperature
of 114K by the IBM group.

However, he added that the mercury-based compounds are rather
unstable.  Usually, they are not easy to make in pure form, and
they decompose easily at the high temperatures required to shape
them into practical forms, such as wires for power transmission and
generators.   This is to say that Hg is lost at temperatures above
350oC.

Recently, progress has been made in this respect.  By doping the
compounds, the synthesis of the materials has been simplified and
the materials so prepared become more stable.  Preliminary success
has been achieved in wire-making.  Small single crystals of the
compounds have been obtained with high enough quality for
scientific study.

However, more material improvements are needed before these new
compounds can become a material of practice. Chu was not available
to elaborate on these topics at press time.  Look for a follow-up
in next month's issue.

Optical Waveguides of
Alumina Thin Films

Alumina waveguides formed by reactive rf magnetron sputtering were
studied by researchers at Massachusetts Insitute of Technology and
Hanscom Air Force Base (Lionel O. Bouthillette, Optoelectric
Components Branch, Hanscom AFB, Bedford, MA 01731-2909) as a
candidate material for optical waveguides.  Use of sputtering to
form alumina films enables it to be deposited in the amorphous
state, removing the necessity of achieving a crystallographic match
with the substrate.  The researchers describe in the Journal of the
American Ceramic Society amorphous alumina films deposited at
temperatures up to 800 oC and varying oxygen flow rates in the
deposition chamber.

The refractive index of the amorphous alumina films averaged 1.65
over a transmission range of 200 nm to 7 microns with reproducible
losses of 1dB/cm at a 632.8 nm wavelength.  A refractive index of
greater than 1.4 is desirable for compatibility with silicon
technology and less than 1.8 for coupling with fibers.  The
chemical inertness, adherence, hardness, wear resistance, and
mechanical durability of alumina films additionally makes these
materials suitable for waveguide applications.

Lightning Optical Picks
Up Two SBIR Contracts

Two Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracts totaling
almost $700,000 have been awarded to Lightning Optical Corp. (431
E. Spruce St., Tarpon Springs, FL 34689; Tel: 813/938-0092, Fax:
813/938-9493). Gregory J. Quarles and Arlete Cassanho, director of
research and senior research scientist, respectively, at Lightning
Optical, will head up the programs.

The first is a $600,000 Phase II award from NASA Langley and will
be in support of solid-state laser materials development at NASA
Langley's Flight Electronics Division.  The SBIR is effective
through 1997 and covers the crystal growth of highly-doped
Cr:LiSrAlF6 (LiSAF) for diode-pumping applications.

The program's primary emphasis is for the company to make use of
their proprietary Czochralski fluoride growth technique to develop
and commercialize a reliable source of LiSAF materials.  The
characterization and optimization of the furnace thermal
characteristics and various growth parameters and their impact on
the crystal structure during the growth process will be included in
the development.

Quarles noted that the Phase II award follows a $65,000 Phase I
program completed in July 1994, which proved that the material
could be grown and losses minimized.  Lightning Optical's process
results in LiSAF ingots about 25 mm in diameter and 170 mm in
length.

The second award is a $71,500 Phase I contract from the Department
of Energy and will be in support of component development for Laser
Technology for Chemical Analysis and Nonproliferation Activities
for DOE.  The SBIR is effective from Sept. 1, 1995, to March 23,
1996.

The emphasis of the research will be crystal growth and
characterization of Cr-doped LiSrGaF6 (LiSGaF) for diode-pumped,
solid-state laser applications.  A second focus is on the
development of environmentally rugged ultraviolet coatings for
nonlinear crystals.  The final area of research is the measurement
of thermo-optical parameters and laser efficiencies of Cr:LiSAF and
Cr:LiSGaF under identical conditions.  The purpose of this testing
is to determine which material is more robust and better suited to
the applications.

Display Panels Made
from Plastic Wrap

U.S. Patent 5,469,020 was issued on Nov. 21, 1995, to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a flexible large-screen
display that has multiple light-emitting elements sandwiched
between crossed electrodes.  The inventor is Bradley R. Herrick
(Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/981-3356).  The
resulting panels are especially well adapted to inexpensive flat-
panel TV screens or exceptionally large flat-panel displays whose
geometry is not limited to flat surfaces, but may take on curved or
cylindrical configurations.

The patent abstract explains that active light-emitting components
are integrated into a thin, flexible, plastic-wrap like film to
provide an exceptionally large continuous display in which the film
contains densely distributed light-emitting elements that are
addressed by a grid of transparent conductors.  Inexpensive bulk
processing techniques are used to produce plastic wrap with
embedded components completely through the film to permit
activation via a row-column matrix.  The displays are comprised of
a flexible film having two opposing sides and a pair of crossed
electrodes on either side of the film.  A number of light-emitting
elements are dispersed in the film and extend from one side of the
film to the other, sandwiched between the crossed electrodes.  The
light-emitting elements are small enough to permit numbers of the
elements to exist at a crossover.

The topological layout provides mass redundancy of components,
spatial decorrelation of component yields, and dramatic reduction
in registration problems of metallic interconnects.  The design can
be used for electroluminescent tape in automotive pin striping and
sign applications, for flexible glue-on displays, and for video
displays such as workstations, HDTV, theater screens, and
billboards.

Herrick explained that the patent is based on theory for the time
being, and that no working models currently exist.  He also said
that calculations indicate that the thinner the plastic the better,
and he would initially be working with films in the 10 to 100
micron thickness range.  The concept involves placing up to
hundreds of diodes in a single pixel, making the technology most
suitable to displays larger than 60 inches diagonally and scaleable
to even larger sizes.  He is currently assembling a production team
and says the only real problem is the same one faced industry-wide
-- blue diodes.

The Payoff in
No-Clean

Low-residue soldering processes now being used by the electronics
industry in manufacturing military equipment are saving time and
money while reducing pollution, according to a recent task force
report.

Texas Instruments reports that since it received permission to use
low-residue soldering for work done under more than 60 military
contracts, it has reduced its materials-processing costs for
printed circuit boards by 96 percent. Texas Instruments was one of
nine companies and military organizations that collaborated with
the U.S. Department of Energy in a task force evaluation of the use
of such processes for making military components. The task force
was organized by Sandia National Laboratories, a DOE multiprogram
national laboratory.

Conventional processes for soldering printed wiring boards use an
activated rosin-based flux prior to soldering to remove oxidation.
Oxidation also is prevented by doing the soldering in a sealed
nitrogen chamber. The rosin-based flux leaves a tacky residue that
previously was removed with ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC) solvents. It has been estimated that solvents used to clean
electronic equipment accounted for 24 percent of the consumption of
CFCs in the United States.

Low-residue processes eliminate the need for these CFC cleaning
solvents by using a mild organic acid as the fluxing agent. These
organic agents, such as the common food additive adipic acid, leave
little residue and require no cleaning.

When the Low-Residue Soldering Task Force was organized in 1993,
low-residue processes were being used for commercial applications,
but the Department of Defense required that use of the low-residue
processes to manufacture military equipment be negotiated on a
contract-by-contract basis. The task force was charged with
evaluating these processes for general use in manufacturing
military electronic components.

Sandia researcher Ron Iman (Tel: 505/844-8834) chaired the task
force, which consisted of 17 core members and a team of more than
100 people from 17 companies, three military services, and 12
laboratories and technical centers.

The task force tested low-residue processes at four manufacturing
sites -- Texas Instruments, Hughes Electronics, Alliant
Techsystems, and AlliedSignal's Kansas City Division. Each company
used low-residue processes to produce 80 test printed-wiring
boards. After extensive testing, the task force concluded that
these boards were as good as those manufactured by using rosin
flux.

For confirming the value of the low-residue soldering processes,
the task force was recognized with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's 1995 Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award.
Stephen O. Anderson, deputy director of the EPA's Stratospheric
Protection Division, called the task force's findings "one of the
most important soldering reports of the decade."

Besides Sandia and the four companies, other organizations
participating in the task force were the Naval Air Warfare Centers
(China Lake, CA, and Indianapolis, IN); the Army Missile Command
(Huntsville, Ala); the Air Force Materiel Command (Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base); and the Electronics Manufacturing Productivity
Facility.

Jeff Koon, a Texas Instruments process engineer who served on the
task force, says Texas Instruments is now using a low-residue
process in its production facility in McKinney, Texas. Using the
process is saving more than $300,000 annually in materials costs,
Koon says. It also is simpler to use and saves time in the
production process.

Koon says the low-residue process is friendlier to the environment
in several ways. It eliminates the need for CFCs and other noxious
cleaning materials, and it significantly reduces the amount of lead
dross produced during the manufacturing process.

Book-to-Bill Down, but
Billings Hit New High

The Semiconductor Industry Association reports its preliminary
book-to-bill ratio for the North American market in December
dropped slightly from November's figure of 1.10 to 1.09.  However,
billings for the month came in at a record $4.43 billion, up 38.4%,
or $1.23 billion, over December of 1994.

Additionally, the book-to-bill ratio also indicates that, despite
the record, bookings continue to strongly outpace billings.  The
ratio indicates that for every $100 billed, the industry registered
$109 in new orders.  Overall, billings rose 0.5% over November's
figures, and bookings declined from the November record of $4.87
billion to $4.82 billion.  Preliminary figures for 1995 show that
billings for the North American semiconductor market rose 39.8% to
$46.9 billion.

Commerce Department
Reduces Export Controls

Action by the Commerce Department to reduce export controls that
create obstacles such as licensing burdens and delays for U.S.
semiconductor companies drew nothing but praise from the
Semiconductor Industry Association (181 Metro Drive, Suite 450, San
Jose, CA 95110; Tel: 408/436-6600, Fax: 408/436-6646).  The new
regulation, which went into effect Dec. 20, liberalizes export
controls on certain semiconductor devices shipped to China, the
republics of the former Soviet Union, and certain other
destinations for civilian end uses.

In a statement released to coincide with the start of the new
policy, SIA President Thomas W. Armstrong said, "This modernization
of export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless
and costly licensing delays and burdensome paperwork.  These
reductions will lead to further export opportunities in areas with
major growth potential over the next decade."

The SIA notes that commercial semiconductors represent one of the
least controllable and most widely available high-technology
products in the world today.  Further maintenance of the old export
controls would have damaged U.S. industry without making any
material contribution to U.S. security.

Armstrong added, "The Commerce Department has made substantial
progress in the reduction of outmoded export licensing
requirements.  Continuation of this export liberalization process
to reflect the end of the Cold war will only stimulate business
opportunities and job creation."

In a related development, SIA also reported that the foreign share
in the Japan market for semiconductors rose more than 3% in the
third quarter to 26.2%.  Though no specific figures regarding the
U.S. share of the increase were available, Armstrong touted the
competitiveness of domestic chip makers as well as the U.S.-Japan
agreement as major factors.  SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said that
indications pointed to a "substantial" U.S. share in the increase.

Armstrong also added that "strong relationships between the U.S.
and Japanese industries are being built," which would not have been
possible without the agreement.  Weir emphasized the SIA's support
for renewal of the pact, due this year, which is meeting some
resistance in Japan.

corrosion resistance.  According to ART's Mary Spohn, the materials
can also be tailored via the addition of metals and ceramics to
provide desired properties such as electrical conductivity or
resistivity.

Radiance Process Is
Technology of the Year

IndustryWeek Magazine has chosen Radiance Services Co.'s (4405
East-West Hwy., Suite 512, Bethesda, MD 20814; Tel: 301/654-0228,
Fax: 301/654-1034) Radiance Process as a Technology of the Year
award winner.  Radiance Services was one of only five companies or
institutions so honored.

The novel system cleans wafer surfaces without the use of
chemicals.  It makes use of a pulsed-laser light source radiating
between 172 and 257 nm and a flowing inert gas.  The energy
imparted by the light lifts away contaminants, which are then
carried away by the flowing gas.  The light's energy is capable of
breaking covalent, ionic, coulombic, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen
bonds holding the contaminants to the surface.  Laminar flow of the
gas is said to provide a stable boundary layer, preventing
contaminant reattachment.

The company recently announced an agreement with Microelectronics
Research Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for the EPA to provide funding to
acquire a Radiance Process wafer-cleaning system for a
demonstration project.  The project is to be managed by the MRL and
the EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory.  The EPA
will contribute $335,000 to the construction of the tools as part
of its Environmental Technology Initiative.  The process is
currently being demonstrated at Diffraction Ltd. in Waitsfield, VT,
and at IMEC in Leuven, Belgium.

Radiance Services President Donna Fitzpatrick was delighted with
the award, saying that the publication has proven itself superb at
picking winners.  She added that the award was an acknowledgment of
the recognition Radiance has received from around the world.  She
also noted recent recognition from Solid State Technology for their

Manufacturing Services
to Get New SIC Codes

The U.S. Department of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census, in
cooperation with the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging
Electronic Circuits (2215 Sanders Road, Northbrook, IL 60062-6135;
Tel: 708/509-9700, Fax: 708/509-9798), have developed a new
Standard Industry Classification (SIC) Code for the Electronic
Manufacturing Services Industry (EMSI).

The code, 3679800, establishes the government's recognition of what
has become an $11 billion-a-year industry.  The new description,
codes, and request for data will be published by the Department of
Commerce in their 1995 instruction manual, MA36Q, and will be sent
to EMS providers early this year.

The new code is broken down into seven markets: "Computer and
peripheral printed board assemblies (3679851)"; "Communications
printed board assemblies (3679853)"; "Industrial process control
board assemblies (3679855)"; "Instrumentation printed board
assemblies (3679857)"; "Search and Detection printed board
assemblies (3679859)"; "Consumer electronic printed board
assemblies (3679861)"; and "Other electronics, printed board
assemblies (3679890)."  The previous one-line SIC description for
the industry read, "Receipts for work by contract assemblers, board
stuffers, and related job shops."

Additionally, work continues with the Department of Commerce in the
development of a new North American Industrial Classification
System (NAICS).  IPC is seeking to ensure proper recognition and
clarification of the NAICS codes for printed board assemblies,
printed boards, and laminate base material.

Group to Set Exit
Charge Standards

Electrostatic charges are the cause of a wide array of problems in
semiconductor-manufacturing processes, ranging from circuit damage
and particle contamination to outright equipment malfunctions.  The
industry believes that static-related problems cost it more than
$100 million a year in lost productivity and reduced yields.

Now, a new group has been formed to add muscle to the fight against
static discharge problems.  The Exit-Charge Working Group is made
up of Arnold Steinman of Ion Systems, Julian Montoya of Intel
Corp., David Jensen of Advanced Micro Devices, Michael Yost of the
University of Washington, Vaughn Gross of IBM Microelectronics,
Robert Donovan of Sandia National Laboratories, Steve Silverman of
Meissner & Wurst, Fred Lakhani of Sematech, Al Lieberman of
Particle Measuring Systems, Jay Shideler of National Semiconductor,
and Chris Billat of KLA Instruments.

At the Group's second meeting, held recently in Austin, TX,
Steinman noted that the ESD Association studies the effects of
static charge from and on people but have yet to tackle equipment
issues.  According to Gross, its goal is the development of a SEMI
standard that will "set acceptable levels of static charge for the
purposes of eliminating equipment problems due to ESD events that
produce electromagnetic interference, eliminating equipment
problems due to difficulties in handling charged objects, reducing
the attraction of particles to charged surfaces, and reducing
product and reticle damage due to ESD."

Steinman added that existing SEMI Standard 801-2 does address ESD
immunity levels for equipment only, and it relies on test levels
that are much lower than is actually experienced in operation.
Thus, the standards fall short of protecting both wafers and
equipment at key stages of the manufacturing process.

The Group will focus on the development of a matrix of various
levels of static charge and recommended practices.  A meeting with
SEMI standards officials is set for the Working Group's next
gathering, which will take place in Norfolk, VA, where the
formation of a standards committee on exit charge will be
discussed.  The plan is to have a SEMI standard in place in 1997.

IPC Has the
Right Stuff

The IPC Printed Circuits Expo, to be held March 3-7, 1996, at the
San Jose (CA) Convention Center, will feature former astronaut
Capt. Wally Schirra as keynote speaker.  His address can be heard
on March 5.

Captain Schirra is the only astronaut to have flown Mercury,
Gemini, and Apollo missions.  In 1962, he piloted the Sigma 7
Mercury craft on its six-orbit mission and later served as Command
Pilot for Gemini 6.  That mission included the successful
rendezvous with Gemini 7.  He also served as Command Pilot for
Apollo VII in 1968, which was the first flight test of the three-
person spacecraft.

The Printed Circuit Expo will feature some 100 technical
presentations, 21 workshops, and will house nearly 650 exhibit
booths.  Further, IPC expects the event to draw some 3,500
attendees to what is the largest trade show and technical
conference in North America exclusively devoted to the printed wire
board industry.

Diamond Nucleation by
Gas-Phase Seeding

Diamond films have been deposited on substrates without
pretreatment by placement of a nickel wire above the substrate by
a group in Germany, led by Ch. Woll (Institut fur Angewandte
Physikalische Chemie, Universitat Heidelberg, INF 253, 69120
Heidelberg, Germany; E-mail: cc1@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de),
according to Applied Physics Letters..  The nickel wire was seen to
increase the nucleation density by five orders of magnitude.
Electron microscopy showed continuous diamond films to be produced
with Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
showing the presence of Ni in the diamond phase.

The diamond was grown in a standard hot-filament CVD chamber with
a tungsten hot coil and a resistively heated substrate holder.  The
substrate (100 or 111 silicon or Cu) was heated to 800oC -850oC, 5
mm from the filament.  Growth rates of 0.5-1 micron/hour were
attained in a 0.5% methane, 95.5% hydrogen at a 100 sccm flow rate.
When the Ni wires were placed 0.5-1 mm from the substrate, diamond
was seen to grow preferentially in the area in line with the Ni
wire and the coil.

Lam Upgrades
CVD Systems

Lam Research Corp. (4650 Cushing Pkwy., Fremont, CA 94538-6470;
Tel: 510/659-0200, Fax: 510/572-2935) has announced upgrades to the
company's Integrity PMD (premetal dielectric) and Epic IMD
(intermetal dielectric) chemical vapor-deposition (CVD) tools first
introduced for advanced development efforts in 1990 and 1993
respectively.  The new systems address production-level dielectric
film needs for devices produced with 0.35-micron design rules and
below.

The deep SubMicron (DSM) 9900 deposits insulating films between
metal layers for IMD applications, while the DSM 9800 deposits
dielectric films prior to first metallization in PMD applications.
The 9800 will also handle such applications as SiO2 spacers and
Ta2O5 storage capacitors for 256-megabyte DRAMs.  Lam's Chairman
and CEO Roger D. Emerick noted that both systems have deposited
films on devices with 0.18-micron features, and the 9800 has
deposited films of high quality on 300 mm wafers (EMTN, August).

The company said the new 9000-series CVD tools offer features
developed in cooperation with several leading chipmakers and the
industry consortium SEMATECH.  Changes include footprint
reductions, throughput increases, and newly developed process
solutions for specific film types.  Lam also claims a reduced cost
of ownership for the latest designs.

New Ion Implanter
From Applied Materials

Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA; Tel: 408/727-5555) introduced
its Precision Implant xR80 ion implanter that is targeted to the
low-energy implant market.  The energy range is capped at 80 KeV,
but the system performs the delicate task of forming the
transistors on chips with deep submicron design rules.

The new implanter is capable of generating a beam at relatively
high current levels (5 milliamps at 5 KeV).  This boosts throughput
when forming the shallow junctions, as opposed to deep wells, of
DRAM and logic devices built with 0.25- and .18-micron line widths.
The xR80 is tailored to the formation of transistors and differs
from the recently announced Genus implanter, which is more of a
general purpose system.

Focused Ion Beams
Make Smaller Chips

Los Alamos National Lab researchers are trying to make smaller
computer chips using technology first developed for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization's now defunct Neutral Particle
program.  Ion beams used in microlithography are focused by
magnetic optics.  This technology offers narrower linewidths than
now possible, which makes more compact and powerful circuits.

According to Tom Mottershead (Tel: 505/667-9730) of Los Alamos,
this technology can achieve a 25-to-1 reduction in beam diameter.
A sharp focus such as this allows the beam to deliver high current
densities for etching the fine lines of microchip circuitry.  The
technology is also useful in probing the surfaces of high-density
microcircuits, inspecting the patterns of photomasks, and checking
for defects.  Data storage is another possible application as
focused beams of gallium ions could read and write data in media
more durable than today's CD-ROM.

Mottershead has proposed experimentation on an in-house basis at
the Lab's Accelerator Operations and Technology Division using an
existing tandem electrostatic accelerator and is interested in
possible collaborations with industry.

Curable Printed
Circuit Boards

Curable flame-retardant resins intended for use as the basic
material in printed circuit boards has been prepared by Gurit-Essex
(Papiermuhlestrasse 155, CH 3063 Ittigen-Bern, Switzerland; Tel:
31/580388) scientists.  Herbert Schriber, Gunter Burkart, and Bruno
Knaus report that the new formulation includes a thermally curable
1-oxa-3-aza tetraline group-containing compound, a curable epoxy
compound, and a flame retardant.  The flame-retardant additive may
be aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, elemental red
phosphorus, oxygen acids of phosphorus, inorganic salts of oxygen
acids of phosphorus, polyphosphates, boric acid, or salts of boric
acid.

Although bromine-based flame-retardant additives impart the
required flame retardance to resins used in the manufacture of
printed circuit boards, they can generate poisonous and/or
corrosive gases when exposed to fire.  As a result the Gurit-Essex
researchers sought a nonhalogenated alternative to flame retard the
resins.  U.S. Patent 5,443,911 explains the Gurit-Essex work in
detail.

New Testing
Probes Developed

Researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology's
Microelectronics Research Center (University Heights, Newark, NJ
07102-1982; Tel: 201/596-3434, Fax: 201/624-2541) have developed
two new types of probes for testing semiconductor chips.  According
to center spokesman Paul F. Hassen, the first device measures the
function of the chip or chip package itself, while the second looks
for hot spots.

The Conformable, HI-Pin-count, Programmable (CHIPP) probe card is
said to offer several advantages over current technology.  The
device can be conformed to match chip pads that may be found on
various levels or a curved surface.  It can also make contact with
closely spaced pads and can be programmed to handle a large number
of chip designs.  The research was funded by NJIT and Pacific
Western Systems Inc.

The heat sensor uses a thermometer probe to measure chip surface
temperatures over distances as small as a few tens of atoms.  Aside
from scanning for the tiniest of hot spots, it can also serve as
the probe tip for scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopes.
Research on this device was funded by Murray Hill Devices Inc. and
Digital Equipment Corp.

HYT Debuts New
Particle Sensor

Pacific Scientific's High Yield Technology (HYT) Division (1178
Bordeaux Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94089; Tel: 408/541-6455, Fax:
408/541-6450) has released the Model 8000 in situ particle-
monitoring system.  The device is designed specifically for use in
the 8310 oxide and 8330 metal etch systems from Applied Materials.

The Model 8000 is an updated version of HYT's Model 8330 turbo
sensor and integrates directly into the throttle valve of these
popular etch tools to provide production-level monitoring in real
time.  The system's sensitivity has been increased to 0.4 microns,
and it features a new thermoelectric cooler to help maintain laser
operating temperature and stable sensor performance. Peter Borden
emphasizes that for process-control optimization "in-situ sensors
are key enablers."

The complete package includes the controller, PC-based software for
data analysis, and hardware for synchronization of particle counts
with the process cycle.  The base price is $20,700, and HYT says it
can deliver in 30 days.

Spectropolarimeter
Is Small, Fast

Research Corp. Technology (101 N. Walnut Road, Suite 600, Tucson,
AZ 85711-3335; Tel: 520/748-4400, Fax: 520/748-0025) has licensed
new technology to Containerless Research Inc. (Evanston, IL) for
the development of enhanced photo- and spectropolarimeters.  RCT
manages the technology for the University of New Orleans and the
inventor, Rasheed M. A. Azzam.

As a result of the new technology, CRI expects polarization to find
wide use in optical systems such as lasers, modulators,
interferometers, etc.  The company believes the devices could find
use as transducers to monitor coating and film-production
processes, as well as in the development and use of optically
active chemicals, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.

According to CRI President Paul Nordine (Tel: 708/476-2678, Fax:
708/467-2679), the lack of a simple, portable device for measuring
polarization has limited the development of polarimetry
applications.  He called the new invention a  breakthrough that is
"smaller, lighter, faster, and simpler than conventional
instruments, as well as more rugged, sensitive, and repeatable.  We
envision an accurate device with no moving parts, prisms, beam
splitters, or modulators, capable of real-time resolved
spectropolarimetry."

New Defect-Data
Management System

Tencor Instruments (Mountain View, CA; Tel: 408/654-2926)
introduced a defect-data management system tradenamed SwiftAccess
that performs fast, in-line analysis of defect data from a variety
of sources, including the company's new Surfscan inspection system.

Identification of defects and their significance is becoming more
critical to the inspection process.  Although current inspection
systems generate large amounts of defect data, the info is only
valuable if device makers can use it to improve their manufacturing
process.  Therefore, they need a fast, reliable means of viewing,
analyzing, and acting on the defect data generated during
inspection.  SwiftAccess is designed to meet this need.

The system collects and analyzes defect data as it is gathered from
inspection systems, scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), review
stations, and probe and test systems, and then uses the information
to monitor the process, identify process excursions and provide
critical process-control information.  It can distribute data over
mulitple networked nodes, independent of the hardware platform, and
can collect data from the majority of inspection systems.  Designed
for ease of use, SwiftAccess features an X-Windows architecture and
Unix operating system that enable smooth integration into a fab's
existing network.  The system offers high reliability and
robustness, as well as scalability for next-generation
applications.

New Copper
Heat Sink Design

Aavid Thermal Technologies Inc. (1 Kool Path, P.O. Box 400,
Laconia, NH 03247-0040; Tel: 603/528-3400, Fax: 603/528-1478) has
added a new heat sink to its extensive lineup designed to cool low-
power devices in surface-mount packages.  The devices use highly
conductive copper in a profile only 0.013 inches thick for use in
tight quarters.

According to Gary Kuzmin, Aavid's director of corporate technical
marketing, the new Thin-Fin product line may be affixed to a
surface-mount package even if heat sink attachment was not
considered in the design process.  The low-profile configuration
requires minimum vertical clearance and allows continued reductions
in system enclosure sizes.

The surface of the heat sink extends beyond the boundaries of the
package, increasing the dissipating surface.  Further, the extended
surfaces are scored to allow for folding of the devices to provide
clearance around other components.  A pressure-sensitive adhesive
is pre-applied.  The adhesive has a low modulus to take up CTE
mismatch and is pliable to conform to surface irregularities.

BOOKS AND REPORTS

EDN Offers New Guide to
Analog Circuit Design

A part of EDN's Series for Design Engineers edited by Jim Williams,
The Art and Science of Analog Circuit Design, is an interesting and
unusual blend of prose (Art) and how-to (Science).  The 398-page
volume, a follow up to the original Analog Circuit Design - Art,
Science, and Personalities, is sprinkled with anecdotes offered up
by each of its 17 authors, including Williams, so much so as to
make it interesting to read in its own right.  Also included is a
chapter adapted from a commencement address given at Cal Tech by
Richard P. Feynman in 1974, a truly fascinating eight pages.

The book is presented in four parts: Learning How; Making it Work;
Selling It; and Guidance and Commentary.  In its 20 chapters can be
found such topics as design productivity, signal conditioning, IC
development, computer use, and linear IC design.  The volume also
includes a heavy and perhaps necessary, emphasis on economics.
Like it or not, a good design is worthless if it can't be sold.
The book is published by Butterworth-Heinemann (313 Washington St.,
Newton, MA 02158-1626; Tel: 617/928-2500, Fax: 617/928-2620).

Every Aspect
of VCSELs

Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, by Terence Edward Sale of
the U.K.-based University of Sheffield, covers the principles,
theory, design, and operation of vertical cavity surface-emitting
lasers (VCSELs).  Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long way
since their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a large
impact on many devices today.

They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit the
reading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs have
many advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The most
obvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrow
circular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into the
core of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the time
for a book devoted to VCSELs has come.

The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospects
of VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission in
different wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the optical
properties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum-mechanical
processes facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emission
processes are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts are
developed from basic principles, and the effect of strain on the
optical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers are
introduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and the
fabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 explores
the resistance problems that can arise due to the many
heterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.

Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies that describe measurements made
on 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies are
analyzed using models, and the final chapter describes other
aspects of VCSELs, such as modulation response, arrays, and noise
performance.

The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should be
of value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as to
novices and students.  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers is
published by John Wiley & Sons Inc. (605 Third Ave., New York, NY
10158; Tel: 212/850-6336). 1995.  Price: $89.95.
