<H3>Social Security and Mutual Funds</H3>

The White House has commissioned a report on the future of the social security system and some members of the study group want to invest social security trust fund assets in the stock market.  The study will examine three possible options for investing social security assets in the equity market.  According to a preliminary version of the report,

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

&quot;The Council expressed interest in three different approaches for insuring social adequacy while improving individual equity.  One approach involves a slight increase in taxes on benefits, and then letting the Social Security system invest these and other funds directly in common stock, or equities.  Historically, returns on equities have exceeded those on government bonds (where all Social Security funds are now invested) and if this equity premium persists, it would be possible to increase benefits for future retirees without worsening social adequacy protections against low wages and retirement benefits, disability and the financial risk of a very long life.&quot;

<P>

&quot;Another very different approach is to create individual accounts within or alongside the Social Security system.  One option here would involve a slight reduction in the future growth of Social Security benefits alongside a mandatory contribution of 1.6 percent of covered payroll to individual accounts.  These individual accounts would be held by the OASDI Trust Funds but with constrained investment choices available to individuals.  If individuals were to devote the same share of the funds to equities as they do in private funds, they already own and manage, it would be possible to raise benefits for future retirees, again without harming social adequacy protections.&quot;

<P>

&quot;A third approach would go even further down this road of creating individual accounts by devoting a much larger share, 5 percent of covered payroll, to these individual accounts.  Were this approach to be followed, for younger workers the present Social Security system would move gradually in the direction of just providing a flat benefit to full career workers, along with disability and survivor's protection.  The individual accounts might be held by the central system or they might be held privately.  Again, individuals would have constrained choices on how the funds were managed.  There would need to be a tax of the equivalent of 1.56 percent of payroll necessary to finance the transition to this new regime, though the tax would not actually have to be a payroll tax.&quot;

<P>

Ten years ago, it would have been unthinkable for the White House or the Congress to produce a report with such radical proposals for reforming social security but the aging of the baby boom generation is altering the parameters for political discussion about the nation's retirement system.  The senior citizens lobby can no longer supress debate about the subject because many studies are projecting a serious funding crisis when the baby boom generation retires and the first batch of baby boom children are now only fifteen years away from the official retirement age.  But even if the principle of equity investment in the social security fund is accepted, there could still be great controversy over the process by which such investment occurs.  Should the government create a fund management company to supervise a social security equity fund or should the government farm out the business to independent mangers?  If the government decides to encourage retirement saving through private security accounts, should it impose stringent regulatory standards on the firms which will be permitted to mange such accounts?  In Chile, the government permits only a small number of firms to compete for private pension fund accounts.  In the U.S. by contrast, there is little direct supervision of fund managers by the government.  The major goal of public policy is to provide adequate disclosure of information about the fund performance so that individuals can chose a manager on their own.  If the federal government selects a small group of fund management firms to supervise social equity accounts, it could encourage more rapid consolidation of the mutual fund industry than is already occurring.

<P>

The introduction of corporate equity and bonds into the social security trust fund will also have important implications for the government's own funding needs.  At present, the social security trust fund has assets of $360 billion which are invested in a special issue of Treasury debt.  If the cash flow of the social security system is diversified by 40-50% into corporate bonds and equities, the government could lose direct funding currently worth $300 billion per annum or a sum in excess of the present federal deficit.  Conversely, the mutual fund industry is now so large that the addition of $300 billion per annum of social security savings would broadly match the capital inflows already occurring.

<P>

While potential changes in the social security system to expand equity ownership will have only a modest impact on the mutual fund industry, the growth of defined contribution pension plans through mutual funds could have a major impact on the U.S. savings rate.  At present, many Americans are de facto target savers because they belong to defined benefit pension plans.  Under the traditional system of defined benefit pension plans, firms often responded to a rising stock market by reducing contributions to their pension plan.  The gain in asset prices made it possible for them to achieve their actuarial target with smaller savings contributions.  In the 1980's overfunded pension  plans also attracted corporate raiders who then financed their takeover bids by extracting surpluses from the pension plan.  Under defined benefit plans, by contrast, employees can contribute as much as they want and have no clear incentive to reduce contributions in the face of rising asset prices.  At a result of this change in savings incentives, the expansion of the defined contribution form of asset accumulation for retirement could have a more positive impact on the U.S. savings rate than past changes in the tax system.  According to IRS data, defined contribution plans (401-K's) accounted for 29% of pension assets in 1993 or a level three times as high as prevailed in 1984.   At present defined benefit pension plans have an average of 43% of their assets in equities but some firms go as high as 76%.

<P>

Some commentators are concerned that in a future stock market correction, the mutual fund sector could experience large scale redemptions which would intensify any bear market.  The industry already had a trial run of such a risk during 1994, when U.S. bonds experienced their greatest bear market since 1927 and several bond funds had large trading losses on derivatives.  As a result of the bear market in bonds, sales of bond funds slumped and the industry experienced four consecutive months of net redemptions in late 1994.  The redemptions peaked at $5.3 billion in November of 1994 compared to sales of $10-15 billion per month one year before.  But the industry stabilized in early 1995 and enjoyed renewed sales as bond markets rallied during the next nine months.  Equity funds have had no net redemptions since the current bull market began but sales have fluctuated in a range as low as $4.7 billion per month during late 1994 and as high as $24 billion during January, 1996.  In past bear markets, the mutual fund sector was also more resilient than many of today's pessimists probably realize.  After the 1987 stock market crash, the industry suffered net redemptions equal to 4.5% of assets in its equity funds but the outflows persisted for only a brief period because the market itself quickly stabilized.  The 1962 stock market crash did not have a major impact on mutual fund redemptions while there were only modest redemptions after the market corrections of 1970 and 1990.  The severe bear market of 1974  produced a sharp decline in financial asset prices and mutual fund sales but there was no large scale withdrawal of funds from the industry.  Instead, the industry suffered several years of modest net redemptions which ceased after interest rates fell sharply in 1983.  What remains unclear is whether the mutual fund industry was resilient during past bear markets because the ownership of assets was far more narrowly concentrated among upper income people.  Before the 1980's, the assets of equity mutual funds also were very modest compared to the household sector's direct ownership of equities.
