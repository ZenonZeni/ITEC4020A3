GATT COULD CHILL GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY MARINE R&D
COST SHARING

     As international trade negotiations move toward a Dec. 15
deadline, lawmakers have told President Clinton that one of the
agreement's provisions could endanger between $2 and $3 billion
dollars of government assistance each year to industrial research
and development projects.
     In a Nov. 19 letter to Clinton, 21 lawmakers--representing
both parties and houses of Congress--noted that the language on
research subsidies being discussed during the current round of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would "outlaw"
technologies resulting from certain types of government-industry
R&D partnerships. The letter was released by a bipartisan group
of senators and representatives led by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-
N.M.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee technology
panel, and Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.), chairman of the House
Science, Space and Technology Committee.
     As a signatory to the agreement, the U.S. accepts GATT as
the controlling law for international trade.
     The GATT language would likely affect the Technology
Reinvestment Program (TRP) for defense conversion and dual-use
applications functioning through the Advanced Research Projects
Agency and ARPA's new MARITECH program for shipbuilding
modernization.
     An aide to Brown said the GATT provision would also capture
Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), through
which government and industry have collaborated since the late
1980s, affecting "dozens, if not hundreds" of programs.
     Specifically, GATT would make illegal technologies from
projects where a government pays 50 percent of the costs of
"basic industrial research" or 25 percent of the costs of
"applied industrial research," the letter says.
     As it stands, the measure would allow such assistance only
if companies submitted their plans to a GATT committee for
administrative review, a requirement that might have a "deterrent
effect" on some government-industry partnerships, the letter
says. Also, while the language contains a "defense exception" to
the provision, the Bingaman aide says that its most likely
reading protects weapons systems, not technology programs.
     The letter states that ironically, the U.S. government made
the first moves to include research subsidies in the GATT,
"apparently aiming at [the European] Airbus and Ariane" consortia
for commercial aircraft and space launches, respectively.
     In addition, the openness of the U.S. budget process and the
public disclosure required of U.S. corporations allows easy
access to information about government assistance. Other nations,
however, "provide the bulk of their assistance to industry
indirectly through tax holidays, favorable bank loans, [and]
subsidized land...which would not be captured by the [GATT]
language," the members' letter says.

NAVY SUB CHIEF TOUTS MULTIPLE MISSIONS FOR NEW ATTACK SUB

     The Navy's submarine warfare director, highlighting the
multi-mission capabilities of the New Attack Submarine (NAS),
said the service plans to begin NAS production in 1998 at a cost
of $1.5 billion per boat.
     Rear Adm. Thomas Ryan said Nov. 30 that he held out $1.3
billion as a personal objective for the unit cost of NAS, and
said that program officers are working to reduce construction and
life-cycle costs to meet that figure.
     A recent cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA)
validated the requirement for "the Navy's submarine for the next
40 years," Ryan said at a Naval Submarine League luncheon held in
Arlington, Va. The Defense Acquisition Board has not yet approved
development of a design for NAS.
     Ryan said that he expected to see an NAS about the size of a
Los Angeles-class attack sub, displacing between 6,800-7,000
tons. The program would build a series of NAS variants, each
varying somewhat depending on its intended mission. The part of
each submarine that would be different is the section of the hull
in front of the submarine's forward reactor-compartment bulkhead.
     Ryan said the COEA for NAS indicated that the Navy would
have to procure three of its own diesel-electric subs at a cost
of almost $2 billion to counter the threat a $1.5-billion NAS
could address.
     He also said that the Navy would optimize NAS's quieting,
speed, and shiphandling, and would modify the advanced-capability
torpedo to operate in littoral waters. Also, Ryan said that the
QE2, TB-29 towed array, and wide-aperture array sonars, some of
which may appear on NAS, will "significantly improve our ability
to detect and quickly target vessels in coastal waters."
     Ryan also discussed the role of NAS as a strike platform.
     With ballistic missile defense and ship self-defense
increasingly occupying space on surface combatants, Ryan said
that he has decided to include 12 vertical-launch systems in the
NAS while studying the addition of eight more launchers. In
addition, Ryan said that an NAS variant might provide the follow-
on to current Navy ballistic-missile submarines.

Optimizing the NAS Design For Specific Missions

     Turning to the future of the entire submarine fleet, Ryan
noted that DoD's Bottom-up Review identified submarines as the
most effective platform for four specific missions, "for which
the design of [NAS] will be optimized."
     The four missions are:
     * Intelligence Collection and Surveillance:  While
the Navy has developed super-high-frequency (SHF) and extremely-
high-frequency (EHF) antennae for use on subs, Ryan said that the
Navy will develop a stealthy sail for the NAS with SHF
transmission capability that supports imagery. This would allow a
submarine to broach the waterline and transmit collected data
without risking detection.
     * Mine Detection: Ryan noted that commanders would feel
uneasy committing a large amphibious ship or aircraft carrier to
an area not cleared of mines, and that countermine ships
operating in the littoral could face enemy coastal defenses.
     The Submarine Offboard Mine Search System (SOMS), the Navy's
"most significant new system for mine detection," will join the
fleet by 2003, roughly at the same time as NAS, Ryan said.
Deployable from a torpedo tube and tethered by several miles of
fiber optic cable, SOMS would allow complete coverage of bottom
and water-column spaces, he said.
     On other technologies facilitating this mission for Navy
subs, Ryan cited the minehunting capabilities of the AN/BSY-1
sonar deployed on Los Angeles-class boats, the Advanced Mine
Detection System under development for NAS, and the EXUS sonar
backfit for Los Angeles-class submarines without the BSY-1 sonar.
     * Special Operations: "The [NAS] will be designed from
the start to maximize SOF [special operations force]
capabilities," Ryan said, noting plans for a sub  capable of
shallow-water operations and bottoming "in many littoral areas."
In addition to providing a dry-deck shelter for delivery of Navy
SEALs, NAS will have a lock-in/lock-out capability and a
reconfigurable torpedo room to allow for delivery of swimmers or
supplies through torpedo tubes.
     * New Antisubmarine (ASW) Warfare Threats: "More
and more Third World nations are acquiring diesel submarines
since they are a high threat-to-cost platform against surface
forces," Ryan said. However, he added that unlike the former
Soviet navy, "most Third World submarines train almost
exclusively in [antisurface warfare]. Many don't have an ASW
weapon and have little or no training against other diesel
submarines, much less modern nuclear attack subs."

ROYAL CARIBBEAN INCREASES EFFICIENCY,
POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS WITH VMS

     Ship owners looking to buy a Voyage Management System this
year can expect to pay anywhere from $40,000 to $140,000
depending on the complexity and sophistication of the system they
choose.
     But despite tough economic times, companies like Royal
Caribbean Cruise Lines, which currently uses Sperry Marine Inc.'s
VMS on three of its cruise ships and has plans to integrate the
system on two new constructions, are willing to invest in such
systems because of the increased safety and efficiency that can
be derived from them.
     Designed to be used on virtually any vessel, from 80 foot
luxury yachts to aircraft carriers, Royal Caribbean uses VMS
because, "it makes it easier to get hold of information in one
location. You don't have to look at a lot of screens or
instruments to find vital information," Roar Molvig, Marine
Superintendent of Royal Caribbean, told MARINE TECHNOLOGY NEWS.
     But that's not the only reason Royal Caribbean purchased
Sperry's VMS.
     "Based on their technology and very much the price -- they
were very competitive in the market -- [Royal Caribbean decided]
they seemed to have what we needed," Molvig said.
     As well as providing the watch officer with specific
information on where the ship is and where it's going, VMS uses a
Global Positioning System to provide information on where the
ship is relative to such potential hazards as channel boundaries
in a harbor.
     VMS also assimilates input from ships' radar and is able to
superimpose on electronic charts the positions of "other ships
out there that [the watch officer] may have a concern with,"
according to Frank Soccoli, Commercial Marketing Manager for
Sperry Marine.

More Effective Conning Time

     The VMS also increases the efficient use of the watch
officer's time. "The centralized information certainly can
enhance the operation of the bridge and also the safety, thereby
making it more efficient," Molvig noted.
     "To some degree we get a financial return by having the
information about the ship's position," Molvig added. Knowing
this information makes a ship "open to savings" because it allows
the watch officer to more effectively determine appropriate
routing. He can also calculate the speed the engines need to work
at to meet the requirements of the voyage plan most efficiently,
Molvig explained.
     There are two main reasons a shipowner would want to use a
VMS system, Soccoli said. The first is safety: the watch officer
at all times is aware of the ship's surroundings and any objects
which may get in its path.
     In addition to making the crews more safe, however, Soccoli
noted that "a lot of owners are looking at trying to maximize
efficiency through effective manning." Depending on the company,
a bridge crew may consist of two or three people. Sperry's VMS
satisfies all international classification group "One Man Bridge"
guidelines for navigation equipment, meaning ships using Sperry's
VMS in international waters only require a one man watch.

IDB MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS TO OFFER INEXPENSIVE
ALTERNATIVE TO INMARSAT

     IDB Mobile Communications plans to offer a new satellite
telephone service allowing ships at sea to place and receive
calls for as low as $1.50 per minute during peak times.  The cost
structure is at least $4 cheaper than the lowest rates charged by
the International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), a
70-country consortium based in London that now provides phone
service to ships.  Inmarsat's costs range from $5.50 to $10 per
minute.
     The new service, called Oceancell, will use the American
Mobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC) satellite, scheduled for launch in
late 1994.
     IDB Mobile's vice president of sales, John Marra, said
vessels trading in the inland waters and the Gulf of Mexico will
be able to "utilize high quality satellite communications, using
a mobile phone number and [will] receive a single bill." The
company estimates that ships calling on U.S. ports will spend
more than 25 percent of their voyage within Oceancell's coverage
area. The new service, the company said, will meet "substantial
pent-up demand" for cost-competitive satellite service.
     The satellite to be used by Oceancell is scheduled to be
launched in about a year by American Mobile Satellite Corp.
(AMSC), a privately held company based in Reston, Va. AMSC is the
federally licensed provider of mobile satellite services to the
U.S. market. IDB Mobile and AMSC have signed a value-added
service provider agreement under which IDB will service to the
maritime industry.
     The AMSC bird will cover nearly all of North America.
Service will generally be available within 200 miles of the
coast.  The Hawaiian Islands will be similarly served, the
company said. Users will be able to place calls anywhere in the
world. IDB Mobile said most tugs, barges, fishing and offshore
supply vessels will be in range of the Oceancell service at all
times. The service also will provide fax, data and GPS
capabilities.

Equipment Price To Range From $3,000 To $4,000

     To use the new service, vessels will need a small
transceiver and an antenna unit. The satellite's power will allow
smaller antennas to be used at reduced costs. The system will
come with its own handset, with prices ranging from $3,000 to
$4,000 depending on features and antenna type. Westinghouse and
Mitsubishi both are licensed to build phones for the Oceancell
service.
     IDB said it will use Oceancell to complete its second
generation of mobile services.  This summer, customers will be
able to use the company's Inmarsat M service in all four ocean
regions at a cost of $5 per hour or less.
     IDB, which had revenues of $148 million last year, operates
a domestic and international communications network that provides
television, radio, telephone, fax and data services.

NRL DEVELOPS FIBER-OPTIC MAGNETIC ARRAY SYSTEM

Researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) Optical
Sciences Division have developed a fiber-optic magnetic array
system (MARS) for underwater intelligence gathering. The program
is a cooperative effort between NRL and the Norwegian Defense
Research Establishment. MARS consists of eight nodes connected by
fiber-optic cable which is anchored to the seafloor. Each node
houses a fiber-optic interferometric magnetometer, a device that
uses light to detect changes in the surrounding magnetic field
caused by a passing submarine or other vessel. A NRL official
said MARS technology can be applied to a variety of civilian
situations where multi-influence, multi-sensor arrays are needed,
such as harbor and airport runway control.

cushion borne surface effect ship," requires strict weight
discipline by the builder, according to Kvaerner. Application of
the surface effect configuration offers several key advantages,
according to Bore Norland, an official with Kvaerner, including
shock protection offered by the air cushion, and the placement of
all vibration-sensitive equipment above the waterline.
     The design means both crew and hardware are less exposed to
underwater explosions.
     The vessel was constructed at Kvaerner's purpose-built
facilities, which have been specifically designed to build both
civilian and military high-performance vessels.
     The company said the yard's unique configuration permits
cost savings of about 10 percent compared to conventional
methods.
     Delivery of the ship is expected in early 1994.
