<p align="center"><b>NORML National Director To Address Major
London Human Rights Convention</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17,</b> London, U.K.:&nbsp; The continued
imprisonment of Oklahoma paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery will be
addressed by Richard Cowan at a three day Human Rights Convention
to be held in London from June 15 to 17.&nbsp; The Convention,
billed as &quot;A Festival of Rights,&quot; is being sponsored by
Liberty, a London based human rights organization.&nbsp; It is
expected that more than 3,000 people from around the world will
attend the conference.&nbsp; This will be the First time that the excesses
of America's war on marijuana users will be recognized as a
violation of human rights comparable to other forms of political
persecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that the international media and human rights
community will focus on the rising tide of violence and hatred
being inflicted on American cannabis users, which is being
ignored by the American media,&quot; said Cowan.&nbsp; He added,
&quot;having the persecution of cannabis users recognized at this
convention is a historic breakthrough in NORML's efforts to get
the world to count the cost of cannabis prohibition.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">There will be more than 100 speakers at the convention, including
Pierre Sané, the Secretary General of Amnesty International;
Kader Asmal, a Minister in the South African government; and Lord
Lester, QC.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Oregon Senate Kills Marijuana
Recriminalization Bill</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12,</b> Salem, Oregon:&nbsp; The Oregon
Senate killed an effort to recriminalize marijuana possession
due, in part, to the lack of support from key Republican Senators
and from effective last-minute lobbying by concerned Oregonians
(especially cannabis re legalization activists!).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Massachusetts House Passes An Affirmative
Medical Marijuana Defense</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 13,</b> Boston, MA:&nbsp; The
Massachusetts House passed an affirmative legal defense bill for individuals
possessing cannabis who have a legitimate and documented medical
need.&nbsp; Mass CANN/NORML tirelessly worked to get the bill
passed.&nbsp; Lester Grinspoon, M.D., who chairs NORML's Board of
Directors, testified in support of the bill.&nbsp; The bill
(#2170) is short and succinct: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It shall be a prima facie defense to a charge of possession
of marihuana (sic) under this section that (1) the defendant is a
patient certified to participate in a therapeutic research
program described in..., or (2) the defendant, without medical
use of marihuana, (i) would be faced with a clear and imminent
danger, (ii) could reasonably expect that his use of marihuana
would be effective in abating the danger, and (iii) there is no
legally available alternative which would be equally effective in
abating the danger. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill now moves on to the State Senate for consideration. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on Mass. HB 2170, please contact Mass
CANN/NORML's Steve Epstein, Esq., (617) 599-3161 or NORML Board
Member Richard Evans, Esq., (413) 586-1348.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>California Senate Committee Approves Medical
Marijuana Bill<br>
Senate Ratification Expected!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 13,</b> Sacramento, CA:&nbsp; In a 6 to 1
bipartisan vote, the Criminal Procedure Committee of the State
Senate passed AB 1529 which will effectively decriminalize the
possession or cultivation of medical marijuana for individuals
being treated for cancer, AIDS, glaucoma or multiple sclerosis in
the State of California.&nbsp; The bill has enjoyed editorial
support from six major daily newspapers as well as patients and
the medical community. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on AB 1529 please contact Californians for
Compassionate Use, Dennis Peron, (415) 864-1961 or California

<p align="center"><b>Dutch Police Chiefs Agree: Continue To
Separate Cannabis From &quot;Hard&quot; Drugs!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 10,</b> Amsterdam, The Netherlands:&nbsp;
A major daily newspaper reports that the Dutch chiefs of police
unanimously advise the Dutch government to make every possible
effort to promote the further decriminalization of
&quot;soft&quot; drugs [cannabis products---ed.] internationally. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>De Telegraaf</i>, Dutch policy makers have agreed
to postpone plans to overhaul Holland's drug policies until
September.&nbsp; In the mean time, all main political parties
(government and opposition) have all agreed to maintain the
following policies: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">1.) The &quot;classic element&quot; of Dutch drug policy,
separating the &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; markets, has
to remain intact because of its evident success. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">2.) The &quot;soft&quot; drug market now desperately needs
further regulation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">3.) Legalization of &quot;hard&quot; drugs is not on the
agenda.&nbsp; (Though, experiments with medical supply of
narcotics to problematic addicts in maintenance programs
are.---ed.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>More News From The Netherlands: Univ. Of
Amsterdam Study Concludes That &quot;Tolerant&quot; Cannabis Laws
Do Not Lead To More Use</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 10,</b> Amsterdam, The Netherlands:&nbsp;
Contrary to what many people assume about the citizens of
Amsterdam, where the sale of cannabis in coffeeshops is allowed,
the majority of the population does not indulge in cannabis or
hashish. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Department of Social Geography of the Univ. of Amsterdam has
monitored the cannabis use of the Amsterdam population (ages 12
years-old and up) since 1987 by means of three large scale
household surveys.&nbsp; According to researcher Dr. Peter Cohen,
observing the period 1987-1994, the average age for first time
cannabis use in The Netherlands is a remarkably high twenty years
of age [as compared to 14 years-old in the U.S.---ed.]!&nbsp; The
research also indicates that despite the high numbers of
&quot;coffeeshops&quot; in The Netherlands, only 25% of the
population have ever used cannabis.&nbsp; In addition, only 6%
admit to using it daily. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">From these extensive surveys, Dr. Cohen has been able to develop
a profile of the &quot;average&quot; cannabis consumer: well
educated, single, outgoing, around thirty years-old, and of Dutch
descent.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Prosecutors' Choice: Jail Or Taxes For Drug
Offenders</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 9,</b> Houston, TX:&nbsp; The Houston
Chronicle reports: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An appellate court ruled...that prosecutors must choose which
they want more: a drug dealer's [users---ed.] back taxes or their
time in jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 14th Court of Appeals was asked to decide whether Mark
Stennett was punished sufficiently when, after his indictment for
marijuana possession, he was billed $49,070 by the State Comptrollers
Office.&nbsp; Since January 1990, the office has been allowed to
pursue such taxes known as the Texas Controlled Substances
Tax.&nbsp; It sells tax stamps to be purchased when a person obtains
contraband. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling regarding Montana's tax
stamp, the court decided that since Stennett was paying the tax,
pursuing criminal punishment would constitute double jeopardy.&nbsp;
Defense attorneys have long made such a claim.&nbsp;
&quot;Anybody who has a drug case and also got hit with a drug
tax is entitled to have their case dismissed,&quot; said one of
Stennett's attorneys, Tom Moran, &quot;Any lawyer worth his salt,
when they hear about this case, will file (the proper paperwork)
to get the case dismissed.&quot;&nbsp; It could mean hundreds of
cases could be dismissed.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Quayle Accuser's Case Due Another Hearing</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 13,</b> <i>USA Today</i> reports: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Brett Kimberlin, who claims prison officials conspired to
keep him from telling how he once sold marijuana to Dan Quayle
before he became vice-president, may get another day in
court.&nbsp; ... the U.S. Supreme Court ... ordered a lower court
to reconsider Kimberlin's suit.&nbsp; He says prison officials in
Oklahoma, working on orders from the chief of the Bureau of
Prisons, put him in solitary confinement just before the 1988
elections. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prison officials, after consulting with a Justice Department
spokesman and officials from the Bush-Quayle campaign, placed
Kimberlin in solitary confinement after learning he planned to
hold a news conference to claim he sold marijuana to Quayle in
1971.&quot;</p>
