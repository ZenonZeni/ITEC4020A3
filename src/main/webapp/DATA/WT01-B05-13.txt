<H3>NATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE RECORDS BROKEN:<br>
CHAMPIONSHIP EVENT PROMPTS DOUBLE CELEBRATION</H3>

DOVER, N.H. - Electric vehicle race teams are celebrating tonight in this
small Southern New Hampshire town. Two vehicles competing in the national
championship American Tour de Sol road rally broke event records late on
Thursday, one day before the end of this annual competition. One team
represents a top electric vehicle manufacturer, the other a small high school
in Connecticut.<p>

        A four-seater sedan built by Solectria Corporation of Massachusetts 
traveled
a record 238 miles without stopping to recharge during day four of the five
day race. The car, known as the Sunrise, is a pre-production prototype which
the company is developing for the U.S. market. It is powered by advanced
nickel metal hydride batteries manufactured by Ovonic of Troy. MI.<p> [This picture was taken in Lexington and as you can see, it's hard to see it due to the number of people admiring it.]<br><p>
        Another event record was set by a team of veteran electric vehicle 
builders
and designers from Bolton (CT) High School. Their vehicle, called the Solar
Bolt, traveled 143 miles, a record performance for a vehicle powered only by
common, lead-acid batteries - the same type of batteries used to start
regular gasoline powered cars. The Bolton High School students have built and
raced electric vehicles for three years and broke the record they set
themselves in last year's race.<p>
        "We have been waiting all week for this to happen," said race technical
director Dr. Rob Wills. "In pre-race testing we were all impressed by these
vehicles and knew they had the capability of breaking records. Today, the
suspense ended." Groups of drivers and race officials stood and cheered as
the two vehicles returned to a display area set up in Dover, NH.<p>
        Both record-setting vehicles are entered in the Discovery Channel 
Commuter
Category, designed for practical, commuter-style electric vehicles capable of
carrying more than one passenger.<p>

        "We wanted to show that we can produce an electric car with range, 
comfort
and affordability - and the Sunrise is that car," said Solectria spokesperson
Mark Dockser. "When the electric vehicle mandates go into effect in 1988, we
want to give buyers the option they've been looking for."<p>
        The race began Monday, May 22 in Waterbury, CT and ends Friday, May 26 
in
downtown Portland, ME. This is the seventh annual American Tour de Sol, the
premier electric vehicle competition in North America.<p>
        The American Tour de Sol is organized by the Northeast Sustainable 
Energy
Association (NESEA), the nation's leading regional association involved in
promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting,
renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts,
NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields of
transportation, building construction and energy.
