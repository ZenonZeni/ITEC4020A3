<h4>CHAPTER THREE</h4>

<h3>LEARY FLIES HIS JOLLY ROGER<br>
FROM THE IVY TOWER</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1962</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the Harvard Psychedelic Project grew in both
numbers of people and sessions, and as we become more aware of
the effects of these drugs, it seemed that the hinterland of the
'psychedelic mind' is <i>not</i> the obscure forest in which
Blake saw his tiger, nor the dream-world from which Coleridge
conjured the mysteries of Christabel and Kubla Kahn. It was a
place altogether different, and much more mysterious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We studied the reports from students using LSD or
psilocybin, and began to chart maps of their interior space
(which we also compared with our own experiences). We were
hopeful that some of the mystery would thereby be revealed to us,
for the 'psychedelic experience' looks intelligible enough. But
here we came to certain other realisations. That this Other World
is vibrant with strange energy transformations and exists&#151;if
it exists at all&#151;in another dimension of mind or self; like
the inside of an atom, it is a space forever recreating itself
and its own mystery. The more we began to peer into it, the less
we could actually 'see'. It seemed to proceed, under pretence of
showing you how it works, to display a series of much more
surprising worlds. It might be called a more or less 'magical
preparation'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All we could say at this time was that this Other
World could be experienced as the moment when one emerges from
the prison of 'limited mind' and becomes identified&#151;by the
simplest but most intense of the acts of mental life&#151;with
the 'limitless mind', whatever it may be, however slight. And we
felt this form of identification or sense of 'oneness', far from
being an acquired or learned state of mental discipline, was a
natural state, the only true natural state for man to be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was then but a short step from this realisation
to individual members of the project linking their secret
'psychedelic life' to the Beyond. And all sorts of claims on
behalf of LSD <i>et al</i>. were made on the campus. Some
advocates of the psychedelic experience suggested that God may
himself be at work in these biochemical compounds, and would
quote the work of W. T. Stace, William James even Henri Bergson,
in support of their growing mystical beliefs. Professor Huston
Smith of M.I.T. said that the subjective drug experiences are
sometimes 'strikingly like those reported by mystics, seers, and
visionaries of the past'. And in an extensive questionnaire study
of eighty-two subjects who took psychedelics at Harvard, the
following 'mystical' characteristics were cited by well over half
the subjects as occurring 'quite a lot' or 'among the most
important aspects of my experience': <i>loss of time sense;
objects snore significant and beautiful; being able to operate
out several levels at once; extreme pleasure, ecstasy, cosmic
joy, paradise; feeling of being very wise, knowing everything;
feeling that nothing need be said.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Freud, at the basis of the human
personality lies sex and aggression, the twin poles of deep
consciousness around which we revolve. But we found that when the
ego-personality was ripped away completely, which can happen
during an intensive LSD experience, what was left was 'purest
love' and a sense of oneness with all living creatures. No sex;
no aggression. Subjects felt free of anger, pity, and disgust. It
was as though the supremely ordinary human aspiration to be free
could be reached, albeit only briefly, by means of these drugs,
which is perhaps what Freud meant when he also spoke of 'the
Nirvana instinct' in man, this yearning for peace which lies at
the very core of our being. It has always seemed to me a pity
that Freud did not write more about the mystical or spiritual
dimensions of knowing, for he was obviously aware of the
existence within realms which do not easily fall into the
categories of psychoanalysis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in New England in 1962 the subject of mysticism
was one that, for most people, was synonymous with religious
faith. And so it was rather natural for project members to turn
to spiritual masters in order to help them identify the nature of
their new experiences, which were not like anything they had ever
imagined before. It was the start of their search for an answer
to the riddle of consciousness or for the Grail, as for something
from the sky. They felt certain in their own minds that what they
had undergone was something which they had personally experienced
deeply, and not really something which they had done for
themselves. It was a gift from God, a gratuitous grace, aided and
abetted by modern synthetic chemistry. God was not only in his
heaven all right; he was also here with each single one of us,
but wholly within. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, the 'good news' quickly spread across
the Harvard campus, and the sort of feedback we got suggested
that the rest of the faculty thought Dr. Leary was starting a new
religion, with psychedelics as the new sacraments. And to the
rest of the psychology faculty, this was absolute heresy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, we began to experiment closer to home,
as it were, trying to find other areas in which these substances
could be used, particularly those with distressed or helpless
people, for whom life had become one long unrelieved struggle.
Such was the case with prisoners at the maximum security prison
at Concord, just north of Boston. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim Leary had had the good vision to see that if a
large-dose acid session could help end-of-the-line alcoholics, it
might also work with 'hard-core' criminal recidivists. And he had
spelled out a research project, using psychedelics, to the
officials at the Massachusetts Department of Correction, the
Department of Legal Medicine, and to the head of the Harvard
Social Relations Department. After a lot of hassle and red-tape
cutting, the proposal was accepted; and thus began a unique and
very successful experiment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We started slowly, with small groups of three or
four prisoners and two members of the Harvard group (who at this
time included, in addition to Leary and myself, Dr. Allan Cohen,
Dr. Alfred Alschuder, Dr. George Litwin, Dr. Ralph Metzner, Dr.
Gunther Weil, and Dr. Ralph Schwitzgebel, with Dr. Madison
Presnell as the medical and psychiatric adviser). We would
usually work in pairs, and go to the prison twice a week, with
one of the days given over to running the prisoners' psychedelic
sessions, which were held in a locked room in the prison
hospital, and one of the days devoted to planning future sessions
or in follow-up discussions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not a psychologist and it would be ridiculous
if I were to attempt to give a scientific appraisal of the
Harvard-Concord prison project. But one thing is certain, the
sessions 'worked' in the sense that very few of the inmates who
underwent the intensive LSD or psilocybin sessions ever came back
(which was the whole point of the exercise). Statistically, fifty
to seventy per cent of inmates paroled or released return within
a five-year period, with a nationwide average of sixty-seven per
cent. We found that one and a half years after the termination of
our project the return rate had been reduced to seven per cent,
which is a completely objective index of success. How did we
achieve these results ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After an initial discussion meeting with an inmate,
when he would be told about the drugs and the kind of effects
they produced, we would then meet three or four more times to
plan his session. We explained to him how he would 'lose his ego'
and soar off into 'non-game' worlds of experience, and how this
would enable him to see himself and his criminal games with
greater clarity. We also encouraged the prisoners to propose the
kind of changes they would like to see happen within themselves,
which might take the form of a hefty South Boston American
Irishman saying 'I want to understand what drinking means to me'
or a coloured inmate from Georgia 'I want to get over my
paranoia'. We would also draw 'internal maps', huge circles in
which we could fill in the expected positive changes and note
areas of the personality best avoided in a session. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the day of the session, we would get to the
prison early, and after chatting to the guards as we moved
through the different locked doors to the prison hospital, we
would assemble the group of perhaps six inmates; and then all
take the psychedelic&#151;which included, of course, ourselves,
since only by taking the drug with them could their fear and
suspicion and paranoia be averted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The physical setting was the best we could do under
the circumstances&#151;we spread mattresses all over the floor,
played taped pop and Indian music, made sure that the session
would not be interrupted by visitors or guards and thus that the
atmosphere would be relaxed and open and permissive. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We found that it was best not to really <i>do</i>
anything during the session, except be there and give reassurance
to anyone who started getting paranoid or fearful; everyone was
best left free to explore whatever material came up, whether it
be entirely personal or involve personal issues with any of the
others present. We found that in a benign, supportive, friendly
session and with a favourable mental set on the part of each
subject, the drug produced a detachment from everyday thoughts
and actions which was correlative with an increase in degrees of
reflectiveness and insights into normal behaviour patterns and in
turn opened up the way for the construction of alternatives. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For those of us responsible for conducting the
sessions, our orientation was, to quote Gerald Heard, the British
philosopher who first introduced Aldous Huxley to mescaline, ' .
. . concerned but not anxious, interested but not engrossed,
diagnostic but not critical, aware of the seriousness of what is
being conveyed and all the more incapable of coldness or shock,
aloofness or dismay'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what about the inmate, for whom the psychedelic
experience came as something not far removed from, if not
actually akin to revelation ? I think for the majority the
experience was intense and highly emotional, with hallucinations
of colours, of positive and frightening scenes; yet it apparently
stimulated them to do some thinking about their lives and what
they were doing with them. One inmate, who initially presented
the classic picture of a 'hardened criminal' of the well-known
American variety, emerged from his heavy shell as a sensitive,
lonely, child-like human being. At the time when I was feeling
highest I had a terrific feeling of sadness and loneliness, and a
feeling of great remorse at all these wasted years . . . and of
the harsh and brutal things I have done in order to survive at
all.... ' Or another, a twenty-eight-year-old coloured brother
who was serving a five-year sentence for robbery and had attended
a school for retarded children till the age of seventeen: 'I kept
saying to myself in thought&#151;where do you belong ? Where do
you belong?' And yet another inmate, a forty-eight-year-old man
serving time on charges of theft, forgery, larceny and escape
with a prior history of thirty arrests, the first one being at
the age of twelve: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>' . . . before taking this drug my thinking always seemed
    to travel in the same circles&#151;drinking, gambling, money
    and sex, I guess what you'd call a fast life. Now my thoughts
    are troubled and at times quite confusing, but they are all
    of an honest nature, and of wondering. I feel somehow
    detached now from prison life, uninterested in gambling or
    even talking to the other cons, except those in the group. I
    think I now know what I want to be and I am sincere in my
    mind when I say that I want to make it so. Because the drug
    opened my mind and I got a better understanding of myself and
    also of the other people in the group, I now feel free to say
    and discuss things, which you generally do not do.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (He was discharged a few months after his first
session and obtained a job with a construction company; he worked
ten to thirteen hours a day and one month later he was promoted
to assistant foreman. A few months later he became assistant cook
in a large restaurant. Ten years later he was still out and
running his own auto body paint shop.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps the most interesting of all the
prisoners who took part in the project is Jimmy Kerrigan, one of
the 'notorious' Kerrigan Brothers, a safe-cracker and part of the
Irish mafia, who is still serving out his sentence, even as I
write these lines, some twelve years after the events I have been
describing. When the project terminated, which it did with
Leary's dismissal from Harvard, Kerrigan continued the programme
but without using drugs, and started a group within the prison
called The Concord Self-Development Group to assist its members
to sort out their lives' priorities and to give guidance on
job-getting and how to 'go straight'. He got together this group
composed of inmates, starting with the ones who had been in the
drug programmer who then voluntarily pledged themselves to help
each other find a new direction in life that would not
automatically lead straight back to prison. I recently received a
brochure from Jim in which the aims of SDG are spelled out. It
ends with a list of questions that each member has to ask
himself, first alone and then with the rest; and 'a hypothetical
case history': </p>

<p><center> RESULTANT SITUATION</center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Concord, five years, indefinite sentence,
feeding off fantasy and delusion for the most part; identified
with the 'boys'; satisfied with sense of belonging to rebellious
fragments of society; 'real' people are people in trouble, in
jail. The rest are 'way out'. No communication via legitimate
channels nor respect for norms of community. </p>

<p><center> THERAPY SUGGESTED</center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reduction of fear, fantasy, and hang-ups, via open
discussions in small group, with trained inmates (A A's; Harvard
Experimental Group; Legal Medicine) who wish to pass it on. Crash
programme (classes two hours; once, twice, or more often per
week) towards self-development, consideration of proper goals and
attainable achievements tailored to variable individual
potential. Readiness for follow-up outside programme. Finally,
acceptance of social norms with respect for self and others in
all areas worthy of same. </p>

<p> It seemed to me then, as indeed it still does, that LSD can
be useful if it helps a person free himself of his habitual
patterns of thought or some kind of 'absolute' sense of identity
in order to see aspects of his life and reality as it concerns
him personally. It is useful for what it can yield in terms of
self-understanding, and is fruitful if it causes someone in a bad
life situation to exert himself to overcome it and learn how to
adapt the new insights to his needs. I think that perhaps for the
majority of the thirty or so prisoners with whom [ had sessions
at Concord, something happened during their experience that took
them beyond the falsifications of rote-consciousness and, in
time, led them individually to achieve a simple awareness and
even affirmation of the world. There is a little light burning in
each one of us which is something we are all too inclined to
forget, though with sometimes quite terrible consequences. And if
a psychedelic-associated programme is shown to help 'hard-core'
cons regain the lost light of that which makes them truly human,
then it is sad when politics and unconscious attitudes work
against those who would like to share something of their
experience and knowledge in precisely these human areas. If we
call a man an animal and then put him behind bars, we should not,
after all, be too surprised if later he reacts against us with
ferocity; it is perhaps significant that Charles Manson spent
over fifteen years inside various jails <i>before</i> he let the
society of plain and ordinary people know precisely what kind of
animal they had turned him into, though our admiration can be
given to such men as George Jackson, Eldridge Cleaver, Huey
Newton, Jimmy Kerrigan who, despite absolutely dehumanising
conditions over long periods of time, were nonetheless able to
detach themselves sufficiently from the 'prison system' and keep
some kind of light of humanity burning within themselves,
sufficient at any rate to preserve their sanity. Perhaps mankind
needs to discover a new culture of humanity before it is all too
late in a world that finally submerges into deepening chaos,
which will only happen if we find alarm-clocks sufficiently
powerful to wake us from the sort of sleepwalking existence which
nowadays passes for 'normality'. </p>

<p> Enough, enough; let us pass on or rather back to the Harvard
of 1962 and try to understand how LSD helped spawn a 'generation
of visionary maniac white mother country dope fiend rock and roll
freaks'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had got to know Leary quite well by now; not only
was I installed as a member of his household in the Boston suburb
of Newton Centers but I would accompany him each day to the
Harvard office, which we now ran as a sort of command
headquarters for planning sessions. There had been a rapid
acceleration of interest in the drug programme, and it was not
long before we had a constant stream of visitors asking about LSD
and psilocybin, and their availability. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps one of our most curious visitors was a
young man called Walter Pahnke, who was, incidentally, both an
M.D. and a Bachelor of Divinity. He was also a candidate for the
Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Religion at Harvard, had studied
Christian mystical literature and had established nine categories
which he felt described a genuine mystical experience. It now
occurred to him that if a group of extremely religious
individuals were to take a psychedelic drug, then they too might
also have a genuine mystical experience. He wanted to know
whether Leary would help him run a drug experiment for twenty
divinity school students from the Andover-Newton Theological
Seminary, ten of whom would be given a psychedelic, and the other
ten an amphetamine. The plan was to run the session on Good
Friday in Marsh Chapel at Boston University, a long-established
Methodist-affiliated institution. It was a breathtaking proposal,
though it only took Tim thirty seconds to agree wholeheartedly
and commit himself to planning the session. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had by this time run or arranged over one
thousand psychedelic sessions for persons from all walks of life,
including fifty scientists, quite a number of artists and
musicians and writers, sixty-nine full-time religious
professionals. We also had a religious advisory committee that
included two college deans, a divinity school president, three
university chaplains, an executive of a religious foundation, a
prominent religious editor, and several distinguished religious
philosophers. We felt that with all this experience we could cope
with any drug-associated contingencies, including this one. This
particular session was to be later sensationalised in the
American press as 'The Miracle of Marsh Chapel, though perhaps
the only real miracle surrounding it was the one of actually
getting Walter Pahnke's Ph.D. dissertation accepted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I was to be one of the 'guides', I was naturally
very curious to meet the twenty students who had volunteered to
take part in this experiment. Our first meeting took place at the
Theological Seminary, and Tim began to explain a little about the
physical and subjective effects of psychedelics, though none of
the students, I believe, had ever taken anything stronger than an
aspirin in their lives. There were one or two questions, but on
the whole the group seemed relaxed if not actually looking
forward eagerly to what was to become for them a most memorable
Good Friday. One of their professors, Dr. Walter Clark, who had
himself used psychedelics, was careful to point out that it
should not be believed that psychedelic drugs are in themselves
religious. He said it was a bit like organ music, which may be
the means to a religious experience for some people. He also said
that drugs had been used in esoteric religious rituals, from the
days of antiquity right up to Boston in 1962, 'presumably as a
stimulus to religious experience'. During any profound emotional
experience, he pointed out, religious or otherwise, chemical or
hormonal bodily changes occur. 'Furthermore, we know that the
natural chemistry of the body includes biochemical substances,
known as <i>indoles</i>, which are similar in structure to the
consciousness-expanding chemicals and seem to be associated with
some of the same psychological states as those produced by LSD
and psilocybin. The question then immediately arises whether a
naturally-occurring excess of the indoles might not predispose
some people to certain kinds of mystical experience or whether a
mystical state of mind might not, on the other hand, stimulate
chemical changes in the body.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All the students again agreed to take part
voluntarily in a systematic demonstration of the religious
aspects of a psychedelic revelatory experience along the lines we
had suggested. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a double-blind experiment. The students were
divided into five groups of four persons, each group with its own
guide, who met with them before the session for orientation and
preparation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, on the day, we all arrived at 10.00 a.m.
at the Chapel. Everyone seemed serious, almost reverential, and
Dr. Pahnke busied himself with the preparation of the drugs,
which he was to administer. There had been a last-minute flap
when Harvard University Officials, an <i>ad hoc</i> faculty group
'to advise and oversee' future drug studies, headed by Dr. Robert
Bales, refused to release to the experimenters the supply of
drugs held by Dr. Dana Farnsworth, head of the Harvard Health
Service and one of the protagonists of the Pahnke experiment.
Nevertheless, after representatives had been despatched to round
up a sufficient quantity of 'non-Harvard' acid, there was enough
to go round, mostly from my mayonnaise jar. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The session took place in a small, private chapel
sited underneath the main building, one hour before noon on Good
Friday, with the reverent sound of the story of Christ piped in
by loudspeakers. The service would last for three hours and would
consist of prayers, spoken meditations and readings from the
Bible, periods of silent meditation, and religious music. We were
asked by the minister to maintain a reverent silence during the
service. My little group of four were amongst those who received
the psychedelic (neither the students, guides, nor experimenter
knew beforehand who received the psychedelic); but it was pretty
obvious after about thirty minutes, when one of my students
normally a shy, sensitive person, given to reading aloud large
passages of Donne's poetry, suddenly began to tear the buttons
off his jacket and declared that he was a fish. Another student
had meanwhile slipped silently off the pew on to the Chapel
floor, where he began to slowly gyrate like a huge snake. The
other two seemed quite okay; one was sitting bolt upright, his
eyes staring fixatedly at the huge crucifix on the high altar, an
insane grin on his face, and with his hands clasped tightly
together, as though clutching his last remaining $5 note; whilst
the fourth member lay stretched out and as stiff as a board on an
empty pew, a position he somehow managed to retain during the
entire service, and then only coming to again after a huge
injection of Thorazine had been administered. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I finally managed to subdue the student tearing off
his buttons, but not before he had removed all of them off both
his coat and his trousers and thrown his dental plate at the
altar, much to the surprise of the students who had been given
the amphetamine, who sat huddled together in the front pews,
nervous and not very sure about where their own heads were at. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was of course quite a lot of activity going
on with the other groups who had been given the drug, almost
total confusion, in fact with some of the students climbing
across the pews, and one actually standing facing the crucifix,
arms stretched out as if somehow able to identify physically with
Christ and his suffering on the cross. One student even managed
to get outside the Chapel and was almost killed when he walked
into the traffic on Boston's Commonwealth Avenue, 'believing he
was Christ and nothing could touch him'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, at two o'clock, when the story of Christ
had reached its conclusion, we all retired to an adjoining room
for discussions; since many of the students were still completely
under the influence of the drug, however, we decided instead that
we should all drive back to Tim's house, where our girl-friends
had arranged a wine-and-cheese lunch, which we could have whilst
taking turns to stay with those who were still out of it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (While most religious leaders would probably be
unenthusiastic over the idea of the drugged approach to religion,
<i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i> reported that earlier that
year one lawsuit brought attention to a pastor who told his
congregation that LSD could bring them closer to God.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Leary, the Good Friday session was something of
a personal triumph, and he began increasingly to study literary
accounts of religious ecstasies from such pens as those of
Wordsworth, Tennyson, Virginia Woolf, and even C. P. Snow, as
well as personal experiences from classical mystics like Teresa
of Avila, van Ruysbroeck, Plotinus, and Saint Augustine; he was
also at this time getting into Eastern mystical thought and read
extensively from the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, <i>I Ching</i>,
Vedanta, the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, Christ's Sermon on the Mount,
Zen, Buddhism, Sufism, Hinduism and so forth. He believed at this
time that in LSD he had found a truly religious 'sacrament', and
one not too different from the Vedic Soma, the Dionysian nectar,
the Greek ambrosia, the Mexican mushroom, the Red Indian's
peyote, or the Chama Indian's ayahuasca. 'When the day
comes&#151;as it surely will&#151;that sacramental biochemicals
like LSD will be as routinely and tamely used as organ music and
incense to assist in attainment of religious experience, it may
well be that the ego-shattering effect of the drug will be
diminished,' he later wrote, and added 'Such may be one aspect of
the paradoxical nature of religious experience.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This call for acceptance of LSD as an aid to
genuine spiritual revivification was not only picked up by many
people seeking answers to their own spiritual problems, but also
by some of his professional colleagues who were in all other
respects highly cautious scientists. Indeed, one of them, Dr.
Frank Barron, a distinguished member of The Centre for Research
in Personality at Berkeley, wrote the following: 'There is a new
time coming, and we shall know it when it happens, when LSD is
interpreted by those who use it as the source for the energy that
is to transform human consciousness.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it must also be appreciated that part of the
problem Leary faced at this time was in finding a 'model'
acceptable to society at large in which LSD could be legitimately
used. And religion certainly seemed more promising as a prospect
than psychology, despite the drug's promise as an 'adjunct' to
psychotherapy, prisoner rehabilitation, and the treatment of
alcoholics; besides which, he was coming in for considerable
criticism from many sectors of the American academic community,
where it was widely believed that the drug sessions at Harvard
were being run nonchalantly and irresponsibly. Dr. Herbert C.
Kelman, a lecturer in Social Psychology at Harvard, reported he
had observed that graduate students who had had LSD experiences
had formed a clannish 'insider group', and wrote: 'I doubt
whether this project is carried out primarily as an intellectual
endeavour or whether it is being pursued as a new kind of
experience to offer an answer to man's ills.' John U. Monro, dean
of Harvard College, wrote a letter to the editor of <i>The
Harvard Crimson</i> newspaper, warning of 'the effects of LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline and other mind-distorting drugs,' which ' .
. . have been known to intensify seriously a tendency toward
depression and to produce other dangerous psychotic effects.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet religion was still very much a new area for
Leary. I think his scientific training was the source of his
thoroughness and even of his originality as a talker, for on the
whole he did not always write very well. There was always a hint
of journalism in what he wrote, a too-easy tendency to slacken
off for long passages at a time, into just something not far
removed from the jargon of the hipster, and the related facility
that suggests, if not exactly knowingness, at least a feeling
that he is never at a loss, an essentially 'olympian'
preparation. He was a follower of Mao and Dionysus, Freud and
Epicurus, and this was never more apparent then when he tried to
define the religious situation. It was difficult to take him
seriously as a 'prophet' or a 'holy man' or a 'high priest'; it
was easier to see him as an inspired impresario, an Appolinaire,
or a Cocteau. Yet he sought to find a common ground on which both
science and religion could meet. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Science is a social system which evolves roles, rules,
    values, language, space-time locations to further the quest
    for these goals&#151;these answers. Religion is a social
    system which has evolved its roles, rules, rituals, values,
    language, space-time locations to further the pursuit of the
    same goals&#151;the revelatory experience. A science which
    fails to address itself to these spiritual goals, which
    accepts other purposes (however popular), becomes secular,
    political, and tends to oppose new data. A religion which
    fails to provide direct experiential answers to these
    spiritual questions becomes secular, political and tends to
    oppose the individual revelatory confrontation.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He found it hard to see how his results&#151;which
read: seventy-five per cent 'spiritual revelation'&#151;could be
disregarded by those who were professionally concerned with
spiritual matters and individual religious development. But
disregard them they did. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, far from convincing everybody that the New
Religion is really dedicated to the idea that we should only
think of ways in which to bring-each other up, not down, he only
succeeded in putting up people's backs. The problem was to find a
sufficient number of people left who would listen to what he had
to say. And part of this difficulty was due to a lack of
austerity in the presentation, which alone guaranteed- public
discussion though not necessarily of a kind calculated to produce
either consensus or rational inquiry. Yet despite Leary's various
resources of honesty and intelligence, his quest for
understanding must in some sense be a frustrating one. Whatever
his ideas or ideals, no two authorities seemed to agree with one
another and each would be the first to declare that he alone
spoke with authority. 'Lots of blacksmiths whose monopoly is
threatened.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary felt that LSD's significance lay beyond all
social analysis and all psychological categories and, since the
drug experience was completely unique, a new model was needed, a
new structure. It presupposed a readiness on the part of those
who used it to undertake a series of new departures, perpetual
readiness to expose oneself to new mental dimensions, even to new
forms of 'reality'. In that sense, no two sessions are ever the
same; each one provides an entirely personal, and at times,
highly idiosyncratic encounter with the self, with each person
becoming his own explorer. So that each session acts as a bridge
between one reality and another, and to the internal voyager
represents perhaps an attempt to penetrate into the deeper
reality below the externals of egocentric consciousness. And thus
the voyager returns, bringing back an inventive fertility and
diversity of experiences to talk about, to illustrate, through
art, through words, through music, through being. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a serious writer, Leary had to throw away the
chance of seducing readers or listeners with too ready-made a
view of human categories. Again and again he demanded that the
reader, too, open himself to the new and unfamiliar, as indeed he
had done himself. He began to speak of 'Man's Fifth
Freedom&#151;the freedom to use your own head and on your own
terms', and of 'The Politics of Consciousness Expansion'. And the
more he used words, the less the clarity of expression. 'We must
entertain nonverbal methods of communication if we are to free
our nervous system from the tyranny of the stifling simplicity of
words,' he wrote in an article published in <i>The Harvard Review</i>.
He wanted the freedom to live close to the hermetic and the
incommunicable and even to the refusal of all language.
Certainly, within those of us using LSD, it was developing a new
sensibility, a new awareness, there was something wholesome about
it, something healthy and vital. It had laid claim to new areas
of its own, and we wanted to share our knowledge with the world.
Verbal tricks were out. We had to make of our language an
entirely new instrument of communication, something to be
undertaken in the spirit of renewal, with a kind of reverence
which you find in acts of faith. The freedom we sought was not
the freedom to say or do what we liked, but freedom as a value
(internal freedom), something intangible yet also somehow more
real. We saw that the traditional means for expanding or
contracting consciousness such as the printing press, the
television screen, the radio transmitter, the movies, were
restricted by law and remained under government control. How then
were we to change this situation? For the purposes of describing
the psychedelic experience in 1962, he had no language, no
trained operators, just a vision that a new language would
inevitably develop to transfigure every one of our social forms. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It is possible that in twenty years our psychological and
    experiential language (pitifully small in English) will have
    multiplied to cover realms of experience and forms of
    thinking now unknown. In twenty years, every social
    institution will have been transformed by the new insights
    provided by consciousness-expanding experiences. Many new
    social institutions will have developed to handle the
    expressions of the potentiated nervous system.' (Leary). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps because poetry is most responsive to the
change of human sensibility or awareness, and is the only true
advance guard of language today, much of the new 'visionary'
poetry is written in lines of simple word associations, that is,
with the poet taking his ease among words; he prefers a limpid
image which floats rather than runs, an image more natural than
precise, and in general strives for a direct, less intellectual
expression or emotion. He sees the manipulative verbal machinery
for what it is, an ego-oriented, aggressive, goal-oriented,
fear-ridden, guilty, unconscious use of language. According to
the American poet, Gerde Stern, 'In a world of simultaneous
operations you don't have to be first to be on top. We are
dealing with word as it exists in our own world as an object in
sight and sound. This is a unique role for the word, which before
our time has been a thing of thought and breath or written and
printed on paper, more of a private experience than in public
media like billboards, signs, radio and television. Most people
still long for a world of one-thing-at-a-timeness.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it was not only true for poets. Artists, too,
were having to readjust their work to match their new insights,
find new forms of expression, use novel techniques to describe
this brave new world of sensory experience. They needed an art
that would reflect a deeper layer of consciousness; colour and
especially shape or form became in themselves more meaningful
than any object they might represent. 'Photographic' imitations
of appearances were less interesting than patterns of colour
which have a power to move us and in ways which we little
understand. The psychedelic artist was 'aware' of sensory
patterns in the intense way that the Tantric artist is; that is,
he created his art out of whatever it was that he had discovered
within himself, which in turn was commensurate with an increase
in degrees of reflectiveness. The artist who 'turned on' to his
own psychosomatic body wanted to recreate this experience
immediately in visual terms which electricity made possible. He
was no longer surface-bound to a piece of canvas or to imitations
of the world of external appearances for he had become more
universal&#151;now he could soar off into these new sensory
realms of human experience. He understood the meaning of such
words as 'liberation' and 'freedom', not only with reference to
his own life but in the life of his art. And he knew that the
visible form would have to be a direct expression of the
'electric' 'pulsating' centre of which he had become aware. Thus
it might seem to those who saw art as simply 'images' or aspects
of nature, that the psychedelic artist&#151;who flooded the room
with colour, movement, sound, and light&#151;was unconcerned with
outer form, and of course they were right. For psychedelic art is
expressive of an inner rhythm, like that of music. And the
spectator who is not possessed of a self-conscious similar to the
artist's, will never understand what response is expected of him.
For the psychedelic artist is learning how to make himself part
of the mystery of his own being by 'seeing' it, living in it;
here can be no sense of separatedness, no difference between 'Me'
and 'Thee'&#151;'We are all one,' he says; 'the art, the
spectator, and the artist are one. Threefold Always.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This may go some way to explaining the widespread
use of psychedelics at pop concerts, for truly great pop music
must present a frame to enable the spectator to merge with the
sound and the colour, and the musician achieves authenticity by
means of the language of 'visual music' expressed in the beauties
of his world of electronic simultaneities (Jimi Hendrix). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would be a mistake simply to dismiss this New
High Art as an art of naiveté, mental or logical deficiency, or
general benightedness since it presupposes that the spectator has
also been able to move beyond his ordinary relative vision and is
thus able to get into the invisible forces within his own deepest
self in order to 'see more seeingly'. And it is the psychedelic
experience that frees one, albeit temporarily, of any 'absolute'
sense of identity in order that one may soar off into the flux. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic artist would rather see his art as
something that arose out of the alembic of self, as a piece of
reality salvaged out of the flux, which manifested itself in his
consciousness from the hidden depths of his being, somewhat
similar to the cave paintings of primitive man, which also arose
out of the experience of living. He is trying to express
something in a non-conceptual, highly-figurative and often
emotive way, through symbols which may themselves be magical,
i.e. that have the power to <i>turn us on</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic artists had found a means of
communicating directly what they had experienced internally. But
what of the rest of us ? As Leary put it&#151; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'We are, in a real sense, prisoners of our cognitive
    concepts and strategies. Passed on from generation to
    generation. The cognitive continuity of history. Our current
    reliance upon substantive and &quot;closing-off&quot;
    concepts will be the amused wonder of coming generations. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The danger is not physical or psychological,
    but social political. Make no mistake: the effect of
    consciousness-expanding drugs will be to transform our
    concepts of human nature, of human potentialities, of
    existence. The game is about to be changed, ladies and
    gentlemen. Man is about to make use of that fabulous
    electrical network he carries around in his skull. Present
    social establishments had better be prepared for the change.
    Our favourite concepts are standing in the way of a
    floodtide, two billion years building up. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Let's try a metaphor. The social situation in
    respect to consciousness-expanding drugs is very similar to
    that faced sixty years ago by those crackpot visionaries who
    were playing around with the horseless carriage. Of course,
    the automobile is external child's play compared to the
    unleashing of cortical energy, but the social dilemma is
    similar.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (It was this particular passage which finally
convinced the Harvard hierarchy that Professor Leary was now
obviously suffering from <i>real</i> hallucinations and that he
had to go!) </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The claim was made in 1900 that the motor carriage,
    accelerated to speeds several times that of the horse-drawn
    vehicle, would revolutionise society. Impossible to
    conceptualise because in 1900 we possessed no concepts for
    these possibilities. But we always have the standard
    objections to the non-conceptual. First of all, we object to
    the dangers: high speeds will snap nervous minds, gas fumes
    are fatal, the noise will prevent cows from giving milk,
    horses will run away, criminals will exploit the automobile. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then the puritanical objection: people will
    use cars for pleasure, for kicks. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then we question the utility: what can we do
    with speedy carriages ? There are no men to repair them.
    There are no roads, few bridges. There are no skilled
    operators. The supply of fuel is small. Who will sell you gas
    ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then we raise the problem of control: who
    should be allowed to own and operate these powerful and
    dangerous instruments ? Perhaps they should be restricted to
    the government elite, to the military, to the medical
    profession. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'But why do we want cars anyway ? What is wrong
    with the good old buggy ? What will happen to coachmen,
    blacksmiths, carriage-makers? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The automotive visionary of l900 could have
    pointed out that his sceptical opponent had no concepts, no
    social structures to implement these possibilities. Remember,
    if one talks about experiences and prospects for which the
    listener has no concepts, then he is defined (at best) as a
    mystic. Our automotive mystic sixty years ago would have
    asserted the need for a new language, new social forms, and
    would have predicted that our largest national industry would
    inevitably develop out of this vision. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Can you imagine a language without such words
    as convertible, tudor sedan, General Motors, U.A.W., Standard
    Oil, superhighway, parking ticket, traffic court? These most
    commonplace terms in our present culture were mystical images
    three generations ago. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The political issue involves control:
    automobile means that the free citizen moves <i>his</i> own
    car in external space. Internal automobile.
    Auto-administration The freedom and control of one's
    experiential machinery. Licensing will be necessary. You must
    be trained to operate. You must demonstrate your proficiency
    to handle consciousness-expanding drugs without danger to
    yourself or the public. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'A final hint to those who have ears to hear.
    The open cortex produces an ecstatic state. The nervous
    system operating free of learned abstraction is a completely
    adequate, completely efficient, ecstatic organ. To deny this
    is to rank man's learned tribal concepts above two billion
    years' endowment. An irreverent act. Trust your inherent
    machinery. Be entertained by the social game you play.
    Remember, man's natural state is ecstatic wonder, ecstatic
    intuition, ecstatic accurate movement. Don't settle for
    less.' (The Politics of Conscience Expansion', Harvard
    Review, Vol. I No. 4, Pages 33-37.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think Leary was most prophetic when he noted one
of the occupational hazards of the LSD game&#151;'You are more
likely to find the evolutionary agents closer to jail than the
professor's chair.' It is true, of course, that unlike more
traditional occupations, the LSD one is not one in which you
normally get smoother and smoother with experience, like a
doctor's: it is (to use Leary's metaphor of the automobile)
nearer to motor-racing, in that the changes are so rapid, the
curves so sudden, and demands an immediacy of response, a quality
of sheer nerve&#151;attributes not often maintained indefinitely
at top pitch. Perhaps it is all part of the pilgrim's progress
which, though undoubtedly preferable in many respects to the
poverty endured by Renoir and Pissaro, Blake and Artaud, is
likely to destroy more talents, in the end, than it nurtures. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here again, we began to get echoes back from
different parts of the world, from people who seemed able to
identify with the message we were sending out. I still keep a
letter we received from Alfred Schmielewski Yogi, the Siddha Guru
from Canada, who had no doubts about the efficacy of
psychedelics: 'Psychedelic drugs,' he wrote, 'are the
breakthrough of the ages and represent an all-important
contribution to racial history. Here seems to exist after a
billion years of unconscious evolution an instrument that man can
use to establish control of racial unconsciousness. Man can now
say that the race can control itself, its unconscious processes.
This discovery will be the birth hour of the cosmic history of
the human species. With this instrument, man can conquer the
stars.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another related area, though not necessarily always
drug-related, was being developed brilliantly by Ronnie Laing,
M.D., in London, and Joseph Berke, M.D., in New York, namely, the
exploration of the experience of 'going-into-madness', with
madness being seen as 'a fundamental human experience rooted in
an untenable intrapsychic and interpersonal situation.' The
possibilities for madness as enlightenment could now be
discussed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Joe wrote to me about some of this, and said he was
trying to get a course together at FUNY (Free University of New
York) in which 'madness will be seen as a key to understanding
the entire panorama of &quot;psychopathology&quot;.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whilst it was possible for us to observe that the
drug research area was one composed of a wide range of <i>sub
rosa</i> activity, utopian dreams, mystical aspirations, and
ordinary vague enthusiasm, interpenetrated by a certain
atmosphere of personal life-renewal, we also believed that young
people, particularly intellectuals and artists, were looking
increasingly inward and back into their archetypical past,
turning, as it were, towards the inner life via the use of
mind-altering substances, just as in the thirties many young
intellectuals turned to the inner life via the church. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what sort of church? And what sort of a
religion could contain the 'LSD sacrament' ? Increasingly, it
seemed, the answers to these questions were coming from the East,
most particularly from Tibet, through the esoteric teachings of
the Great Mantra and spinning-top sound of the universe: OM MANI
PADME HUM. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We found that many of the visionary states
expressed in the Tibetan doctrines described states of
consciousness which compared favourably with induced visionary
states recorded by many of our religious-minded subjects. And in
the Mahayana Buddhist text <i>Bardo Thodol</i>, we found a most
accurate description of the 'going-out-of-the-body' experiences
as well as an entire symbology of 'ego-death' and 'rebirth'; it
was, after all, a Tibetan instruction manual for the preparation
of one's own death, the offices of afterlife, and instructions
for rebirth. We found these Tibetan images and thought patterns
conducive to flexible thought, and we began to discuss such
matters as incarnation, 'white light', death, without
embarrassment. Of this apparent unself-conscious use of
highly-charged, emotive, tabu words and worlds, Richard Alpert
once told a magazine reporter: 'Two years ago, if a guy came to
me, like they do now, talking funny, I would have thought he was
nuts. But what is a nut ? They're all on the same journey to the
East that we are. They may come as a guy with a beard and a
motorcycle or a Tibetan Lama. But we're in communication with
everyone asking questions: What does it mean to truly be ? What
is man's potential ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And of the <i>Bardo Thodol (The Tibetan Book of the
Dead),</i> Gerald Heard wrote that it provided a method: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'which can give us essential aid and guidance in and for
    the most vital and most neglected phase of our lives.... But
    however necessary it is that our American and, indeed, all
    our &quot;modernised&quot; societies be taught how to get
    over our death phobia and so to be freed from the ridiculous
    tabu-dishonesties whereby we attempt to disguise our rightful
    exit, we shall not try this method and undergo this training
    unless we can be reassured on two points, unless two quite
    sensible questions can be answered, two rational objections
    be met. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The first is: &quot;How can a Westerner accept
    the Buddhist, oriental, pessimistic, pre-modern,
    pre-scientific view of life: namely, that the best thing to
    do with it is to get rid of it?&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The second question runs: &quot;Granted, that
    out of the psychological methods developed by Buddhism a
    valid terminal therapy could be extracted, what use could
    that therapy be to any but the old ?&quot;' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In 1962, the youngest and most typical Westerner,
the American, was the most sincere of human beings. His
potentialities were unlimited, and in a world of growth they had
a right to existence. He was moving into a new age, a new culture
of sincerity; the harmony based on heteronomy of the adult
society was to become transformed into one based on autonomy,
when everyone could do his own thing and not be thought of as
either dangerous or crazy, and that all truth which was accepted
previously on the strength of authority would in future become
personal recognition through the development of personal
self-consciousness. If man is to stand on his own two feet,
autonomous, completely responsible for everything that he wills,
thinks and does, then he must be completely conscious of his
causes and reasons. He would have to develop a system of thought
that deals with true bondage in a true world, whilst at the same
time aim for the spiritual state of no-game, no-ego, the ultimate
liberation and the very highest forms of maturity. Only along
such a path can a new order develop, the OM-HUM of presence and
loving process. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After 150 years of fanatical exactitude in his
conquest of the world of appearances, Western man was starting to
discover that he could explore inwardness; though of significance
he knew little as yet. But having once perceived it as a
possibility at all, then he would use his ingenuity to find
perfect expression for it, and establish the perfect harmony
between essential being and the world of external phenomena. The
affective spiritual state was not to be found in the great
institutions of theology, which in fact no one inhabits, but
there, inside the self. He found in his confrontation with the
'Void', things which alone disclosed the nature of reality to
him. He was no longer a stranger to himself, a cipher lost on the
face of an inhuman universe, a puppet furnished with a name. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Excerpt from a post-session Report): </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'This was the deepest drug state. Things became confused
    as to time and sequence. I have almost no recall of what I
    was seeing at this time, and only feeling was important. I
    was seeing <i>something.</i> It seemed that when I cried a
    whole new world unfolded and the fascination with the figure
    was lost. I became part of a vast universe, drawing my energy
    from the earth. The order of things and in things became very
    clear. Love and hate were very important as I entered this
    state and seemed to be clawing at my back in order to gain
    control of the very core of me, a brilliant spinning core of
    energy. From here, probably as a result of being able to cry.
    I began contemplating the infinite sorrow of being alone. I
    felt, however, that infinite sorrow was the key to open the
    door of understanding, like washing the eyes so you could
    see. I felt if you could suffer an infinite amount of sorrow
    and be patient enough to wait an eternity, you could
    understand the meaning of things. However, for me in this
    state, finding the real meaning of the world no longer seemed
    important, but only being part of it myself, a dot in the
    cosmos, and feeling the complete harmony of everything, both
    inside and outside, and knowing that because there was such
    complete order I did not have to worry about myself. There
    was a sense of a lack of gravity and I was spinning, or
    rather spinning and floating at the same time around the
    earth, something like a satellite. I felt comfortable here in
    spite of the knowledge that from here I could not communicate
    with others because all people were One and a part of the
    vast energy of the world, as I was. Energy simply is; it
    exists but has no capacity or wish of communication; it has
    no way of communicating. Death of the body was not important
    here. It was a very wonderful feeling to be able to give my
    energy back to the earth where it had originally come from.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Clearly, after such an experience there could be no
return to a culture based on authority and blind surrender to a
regime where personal opinion is largely erroneous. Courage and
truthfulness, and they alone, accelerate the processes of
evolution. It is in the nature of things that even our mistakes
must turn into blessings, which presupposes a morality in the
universe somewhere. And any crudeness is largely due to our
sincerity. We do not know, as they do in Bengal, how to unite
externally metaphysical truth and telling lies, or, like the
Chinese, how to maintain outer face without breach of faith,
without even questioning to what extent it corresponds to inner
personal truths. Accordingly, loyalty to one's own private
beliefs and empirical truthfulness are among our highest ideals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had a lot of convincing testimony by people,
impressively intelligent where academic and worldly achievements
are concerned, which encouraged us to believe that in LSD we had
a new chemical tool for human expression and development. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the comments and reflections are quite
diverse, we felt on the basis of our evidence that, in the
aggregate, the appeal is one in which humanistic values prevail.
So far from the LSD experience necessarily being the withdrawal
of the mind from reality, it brought it, for certain people, once
again into an enriched everyday life. And for some of us working
with LSD at Harvard during this time, we believed we had found a
means, on a manageable scale, with which our Western kind of
civilisation could be renewed by the discovery of new mysteries,
by the undemocratic but sovereign power of the human imagination,
by the undemocratic power which makes poets the unacknowledged
legislators of mankind, the power which makes all things new. We
could feel somehow that we were involved in nothing less than
'The Great Work of Magical Self-Liberation' of the Tibetan
doctrine when the eyes of the spirit would become one with the
eyes of the body, and God would be in us, not outside. <i>Entheos:
enthusiasm:</i> that was the essence of our 'unholy madness'. And
how far Harvard was from that ideal was the measure of the defeat
of the American Dream. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed the more we studied the reports, the more
we realised that no quick rational explanation would suffice to
cover the range of the emotional power of LSD on the human
psyche. Everything suggested LSD had a different meaning for
different people, a different meaning for different professions,
and even a different meaning for different social classes; people
seemed to take it to fill their own particular needs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only intellectual danger, it seemed to me, was
a tendency on the part of many subjects afterwards to convert the
'inner world' they saw into a cosy fiction. Yet the moment of
illumination, the creative vision, the ecstatic encounter, the
experience of true insight, is essentially brief; once achieved
and expressed, one is again back on square one, a victim, like
everyone else, to the merciless vision of our sceptical
intelligence, or ambushed by stagnation <i>(stasis)</i> and
depression. I also had personal reservations about the claims
made on behalf of LSD that it was the <i>key</i> to the religious
or mystical state or could lead to a truer metaphysics of being.
In 1962, despite perhaps a hundred LSD sessions, I could still
say with Flaubert, that 'I am a mystic and I believe in nothing',
or echo the modern French existentialist, Coiran, who said that
'Once we have ceased linking our secret life to God, we can
ascend to ecstasies as affective as those of the mystics and
conquer this world without recourse to the beyond.' For there is
no evidence that LSD ever made nor marred a saint. Certainly,
'turning on' was interesting for its usefulness, for what it
could reveal in terms of a creative understanding to those who
used the psychedelic experience for their own purposes, and could
benefit from such knowledge. But real courage and a tremendous
sensitivity of mind is needed if one is going to hurl oneself
into a madness that is <i>not sacred,</i> since the <i>real</i>
temptation, it seemed to me, is to link the psychedelic
experience to God and prepare to return to that Garden of which,
through no fault of our own, we have lost even the memory. But if
reality still counts for something, then the psychedelic voyager
had to become a <i>practical dualist,</i> whatever be the
non-dual philosophical doctrines to which he intellectually
subscribes. It is true that at certain peak moments during an
intensive LSD session, it is only the <i>Clear Light of the Void</i>
that alone <i>Is.</i> One transcends at such moments the
dichotomy set up in one's mind between 'inner' and 'outer' worlds
of experience, and sees reality only from the standpoint of the
mystical vision, of the <i>Brahman</i>; and may experience life
beyond all dualism. But after such a trip, when the mountains are
again the mountains, and the lakes are again the lakes, there is
still the empirical world to be dealt with; it doesn't disappear
like the Cheshire Cat, leaving only an insane grin on your face. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very nature of the psychedelic experience makes
it capable of producing apparently impossible
effects&#151;hallucinations are things which are impossible,
which can yet somehow be felt as real. LSD exerts an influence
over consciousness by virtue of its proximity in the blood
stream, but there is nothing whatsoever <i>about</i> LSD; it
cannot exert volition on its own; indeed, there is a case for
saying it is itself unconcerned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Consciousness responds to its influence. This is
analogous to what is called in chemistry catalytic action. The
catalytic substance influences another by its presence but
remains unaffected itself. LSD is in this sense an efficient but
not instrumental cause of heightened self-consciousness; but the
real powers of consciousness are <i>will, knowledge, action:</i>
these are the great triangle of energy, which is something known
to every Tantric yogin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was an attempt by Leary, Alpert and Metzner
to start a new religion based on the psychedelic experience,
which found its theoretical expression in their authorship of <i>The
Psychedelic Experience</i>, a manual based on <i>The Tibetan Book
of the Dead.</i> They had adapted the classic work of Evans-Wentz
on the <i>Bardo</i> plane, according to Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup's
English rendering; but in such a way as to turn it into a
guidebook for psychedelic sessions. It contained technical
comments about: The Period of Ego loss (First Bardo): The Period
of Hallucinations (Second <i>Bardo</i>): The Period of Re-entry
(Third <i>Bardo</i>), following the Tibetan model. </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>'The first period (Chikhai Bardo)</i> is that of
    complete transcendence&#151;beyond words, beyond space-time,
    beyond self. There are no visions, no sense of self, no
    thoughts. There are only pure awareness and ecstatic freedom
    from all game (and biological) involvements ('games' here are
    behavioural sequences defined by roles, rules, rituals,
    goals, strategies, values, language, characteristic
    space-time locations and characteristic patterns of movement.
    Any behaviour not having these nine features is <i>non-game:</i>
    this includes physiological reflexes, spontaneous play, and
    transcendent awareness). <i>The second</i> (lengthy) <i>period</i>
    involves self, or external game reality <i>(Chonyid Bardo)</i>&#151;in
    sharp, exquisite clarity or in the form of hallucinations
    (karmic apparitions). <i>The final period (Sidpa Bardo)</i>
    involves the return to routine game reality and the self....
    For the unprepared, the heavy game players, those who
    anxiously cling to their egos, and for those who take the
    drug in a nonsupportive setting, the struggle to regain
    reality begins early and usually lasts to the end of their
    session.' </p>
</blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, its authors suggested that we die,
creatively speaking, when we cling too fast to the definite. But
if you cling too long to any idea, even to the idea of LSD as a
means of human transcendence, it can become a chain like any
other. There were times when I felt we had forged an 'LSD chain'
around all our necks; our problem was were we ever going to
remove it? The Tibetan idea of 'ego death' leading to 'conscious'
experiences in the after-world, with the possibilities inherent
in that situation of selective re-lives, was a very appealing
one, though it reminded me a little of the Irishman of 102, who,
on being asked the secret of his longevity, said that we should
'choose our parents very, very carefully'. It seemed that the
spirit generated in the generation of the early sixties was of a
certain hopefulness in the possibilities of <i>consciously</i>
making of their future something beautiful rather than brave. The
origins of the Movement are thus in the loving direction of
concord, better human understanding, and brotherly love. </p>

<p> <center>Brotherhood: each person<br>
owns nothing but the whole.</center> </p>

<p> might stand for our motto at that time. Sublime optimism or
sublime nonsense ? Who can really say for sure ? And for the rest
. . . let me just add the only man who managed to live without
money was Robinson Crusoe. Therefore, Practical Dualism Always!
ought to be the slogan of our new psychedelinquent youth
movement, I believe. </p>

<p> Soon enough, the summer came, the conjunction of my planets
suggested change. For a little rest and recuperation I went to
Jamaica, accompanied by my girl-friend, Karen, with whom I had
been living for most of my time in Massachusetts. Tim, Richard
Alpert, Ralph Metzner, George Litwin, and indeed the majority of
the other members of the Harvard Psychedelic Project, took off
for Mexico, more precisely, to coastal Zihuatanejo, there to
start an LSD colony along the lines outlined in Aldous Huxley's
book <i>Island</i>. It was history's first organised LSD youth
colony. And a report from George Dusheck appeared in the San
Francisco <i>News-Call Bulletin,</i> part of which I reproduce
now: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Dr. J. J. (Jack) Downing, a top San Mateo County
    psychiatrist and LSD experimenter, was among twenty Americans
    expelled from Zihautanejo by Mexican authorities June 16. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Dr. Downing himself has treated about forty alcoholics
    with the mindboggling drug at San Mateo County General
    Hospital, with &quot;hopeful&quot; results, as the <i>News-Call
    Bulletin</i> reported last January. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'He was not, however, a member of the International
    Federation for Internal Freedom, sponsors of the Zihuatanejo
    LSD colony. Dr. Downing was there, in his own words, &quot;as
    an observer and investigator of the group treatment
    situation.... &quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The colonists were sedate, professional people, he
    reported. &quot;There were no beatniks among them,&quot; he
    said. &quot;The majority of them were successful people, who
    seemed to have a religious or self-improvement motivation in
    being there.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;Zihuatanejo is a middle-class Acapulco,&quot; said
    Dr. Downing. &quot;The very rich go to Acapulco, those
    moderately well off go up the coast . . . about 120 miles
    north . . . to Zihuatanejo.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'There Dr. Timothy Leary and Dr. Richard Alpert, both
    former Harvard psychologists, set up a Mexican branch of
    IFIF, headquartered in Boston. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The colonists, screened from thousands of applicants,
    paid $200 a month for food and lodging, lived in one of
    several bungalows above a beautiful white beach, dotted with
    palm trees and cabanas. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;There was an open-air dining room,&quot; Dr.
    Downing observed. &quot;The funicular, a little railroad
    going down to the beach, didn't run, so we had to walk. There
    was lots of fresh fish, caught in the bay by Zihuatanejo
    fishermen. The staff was friendly and casual. The setting is
    lovely.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'There are four rooms to a bungalow, he said. One of these
    was set aside for group LSD sessions. Every morning two to
    five persons would gather in this room, with Hindu prints on
    the wall, and Hindu woven prints on two double mattresses and
    boxsprings on the floor. The LSD companions, including one
    member of the IFIF staff, would swallow liquid LSD and plunge
    into the dream world of visions, mind-expansion,
    self-awareness and mystical ecstasy. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The staff consisted of Dr. Leary, who was busy most of
    the time screening applications&#151;more than 5000 were
    received from all over North America&#151;and fending off the
    curious officials of the Mexican immigration service; Ralph
    Metzner, a pharmacologist, and his wife, Susan, twenty-two. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'One of these sat with the LSD group, taking the drug
    also, so as to be <i>simpatico.</i> Those who take LSD and
    &quot;sail&quot;, as the saying goes, believe that only users
    can understand those who are taking it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The dosage was heavy: 100 to 500 micrograms. More than
    300 micrograms is considered an overwhelming dose by most
    experienced pharmacologists and psychiatrists. There are
    twenty-two grams to an ounce, and a million micrograms to a
    gram. Thus, enough LSD to cover the head of a pin can send
    one off like an Atlas rocket. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'As the hours wore on, the group . . . possibly consisting
    of an actress, a magazine writer, an alcoholic businessman,
    and Mrs. Metzner . . . would exchange visions, cry out at
    sudden insights of omnipotence and glory, listen to a motley
    collection of records. Gradually, towards four or five
    o'clock in the afternoon, the effect of the drug would wear
    off, and the drug therapees would emerge one by one into the
    bright Mexican evening. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'For those not taking LSD, the day was relaxed and
    endless: Breakfast at 11.00 a.m., lunch at 3.00 p.m., dinner
    at 9.00 p.m. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;The atmosphere was highly unusual,&quot; Dr.
    Downing reports. &quot;People accepted one another without
    suspicion or anxiety. They seemed very open, very
    relaxed.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Even when immigration officials, embarrassed by stories
    of the LSD Paradise in the Mexican press, moved in to close
    the IFIF colony on June 12, nobody was upset. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;Dr. Leary was very calm. He went to Mexico City to
    seek a modification of the order, but when he failed, took
    defeat without bitterness,&quot; said Dr. Downing. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'They all left for Mexico City on Sunday, June 16, on a
    special DC-3 chartered by immigration officers. The
    Zihuatanejo experiment had begun on May 1. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>' &quot;Six weeks is too short a period to measure any
    results,&quot; said Dr. Downing. &quot;It must be regarded as
    a ruined experiment. My own view is that Leary and Alpert
    have developed techniques of potential value. But I do not
    agree with them that LSD should be available to all who want
    it. It is a potent, potentially dangerous drug, and should be
    used on an experimental basis only, by qualified professional
    researchers.&quot;' </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Meanwhile, back in Jamaica, life had become quite idyllic for
Karen and myself; we had rented a beach house at Seven Miles, in
the grounds of the Copacabana Club, a popular hang-out and
dancing place for people from Kingston. There was a garden ablaze
with flowers, and hanging-plants around a veranda, from which we
had a view over the ocean and of the Blue Mountains behind the
house. There was also a small pool for a swim after coming back
from surfing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Karen and I swam, and dug our limbs in the sand,
made pilgrimages into the bush and to the tops of mountains,
lived very close to nature, with the sun continually warming both
body and mind. Already we began to yawn for the future of
mankind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But is it possible to get bored with a panorama
that is the same virtually every day ? It seemed to me after only
a couple of months of Jamaican weather, that the sky remained an
unvaried bright-clear blue and the sun a bright orange furnace
every day; and I began to yearn for the varieties of nature you
find in Europe. The pull of home was too great. I had to find a
means of returning, somehow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I wrote a letter to Eileen Garrett, a
friend, the President of the New York Parapsychology Foundation
and a celebrated medium, who was extremely wealthy. I suppose my
letter was in some sense a call for assistance, which she
responded to immediately by sending me a first-class air ticket
to Nice, and a cable to say that her chauffeur would pick me up
and take me to 'Le Piol', the headquarters of the Parapsychology
Foundation in France. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I arrived at Nice airport a few days later I
was indeed met by a chauffeur and taken to what seemed to be a
four-star restaurant, just outside St. Paul-de-Vence. But I was
quickly reassured by seeing Mrs. Garrett, who welcomed me and
explained that she had built the restaurant herself, 'to pay the
bills', and there were a number of chalets in the grounds for
guests of her Foundation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After several days there, during which I met a
number of very interesting people, including the Professor of
Psychiatry at Edinburgh University, George Carstairs, who had
written a monograph earlier on <i>Daru</i> (a potent distilled
alcohol derived from the flowers of the mahwa tree) and <i>Bhang</i>
(the Indian name for <i>Cannabis indica</i>) as a 'choice of
intoxicant' in a village in Rajasthan. We also discussed other
names in both India and elsewhere by which Cannabis is
known&#151;<i>bhang, charas, ganja, kif, takrouri, kabak,
hashish-el-k if, djoma , dagga, Samba, grifta, marijuana, pot,</i>
and even the American name&#151;<i>shit.</i> But, alas, he was
not holding at the time, which ever name you called it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, the outcome of my stay at 'Le-Piol' was
that Mrs. Garrett gave me a foundation cheque in the amount of
$3000 to write a report on the Harvard-Concord Prison Project,
which interested her. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was thus able to return to London, cable a ticket
for Karen in Jamaica; as it also enabled us to spend a very
pleasant autumn in a basement flat in Brompton Square. I did
manage to complete the prison paper and sent it off to New York;
my only acknowledgement was from the secretary of the
Parapsychology Foundation, who replied saying that my monograph
read as 'if it had come out of an &quot;atomiser&quot;'; and was
a 'literary work' by which, as a scientist, the secretary was not
much impressed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few months, with the grant money nearly
spent, Karen and I decided to return to America, this time to New
York, with plans for setting up a 'foundation for mind research'
called The Agora Scientific Trust Inc., where the 'Agora' in
Greek times was a market-place, only in this case it was a
'market-place' for ideas about the nature of human consciousness.
