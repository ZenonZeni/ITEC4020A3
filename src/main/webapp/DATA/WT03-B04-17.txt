CZECH REPUBLIC
POLITICS

With the next general election now scheduled for May 31 and June 1
this year, Prime Minister Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) has
moved to strengthen its position by merging with the Christian
Democratic Party (KDS).  The ODS was already the largest party in
parliament, but it remains to be seen how effective the merger will
be.

The problem is with the Club of Committed Non-Party Members (KAN),
which was closely allied to the KDS.  Although the leadership of the
KAN supported the merger with the ODS, the bulk of the membership did
not.  As a result, although the KDS members voted overwhelmingly for
the merger, 69 KAN members did not.  When the vote was carried the
KAN membership voted to abrogate the partnership agreement with the
KDS.  KAN chairman, Emil Dejmek, who supported the ODS-KDS merger,
was forced to resign, along with other members of the KAN leadership,
and was replaced by Pavel Holba.

On the left of the political spectrum, the Left Bloc (LB) has
announced that it intends to contest the election independently.
This means that three parties will now be competing to capture the
left vote in the elections - the LB, the Communist Party of Bohemia
and Moravia and the Czech Social Democratic Party.

According to LB chairman, Jaroslav Ortman, the party intends to spend
Ccr19 million (about US$731,000) in its election campaign.

Another complication for the political establishment is the decision
to transform the current unicameral legislature into a bicameral
system with an upper and lower chamber.  Under this amendment to the
constitution agreed by parliament last year, the existing single
chamber - the 200-member National Council - will become the lower
chamber and a new upper chamber, the Senate, will be created by
direct election.

However, the parties in the coalition government are unable to agree
on whether the Senate elections should be held simultaneously with or
separately from the lower chamber elections.   Josef Lux, the leader
of the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party
(KDU-CSL) and Jan Kalvoda, the leader of the Civic Democratic
Alliance (ODA) have argued that the two elections should be held
separately, while Prime Minister Klaus and his ODS favor holding the
two elections simultaneously.

Relations between the ODS and the ODA have been poor through most of
the current governments' term, and it would appear that Klaus is
depending on the merger with the KDS to counteract any gains made by
the ODA in the upcoming election.

The current representation of the parties in parliament (with the
coalition parties indicated by an asterisk) is as follows: Civic
Democratic Party-Christian Democratic Party (ODS-KDS*), 84; Czech
People's Party-Christian Democratic Union (CSL-KDU)*, Civic
Democratic Alliance (ODA)*, Left Bloc (LB), 35; Czech Social
Democratic Party (CSSD), 16; Liberal Social Union (LSU), 13; 15; 14;
Movement for Self-Governing Democracy  in  Moravia and Silesia
(HSDMS), 9; Republican Party (SOR-RSC), 8; Liberal National Social
Party, 6.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Klaus has suggested that the government be
slimmed down after this year's election through the abolition of a
number of ministries, including the culture and economic ministries.
He argued that a culture ministry was not needed as the tasks it
carries out can easily be taken over by other ministries.  On the
economic side, he argues that a Privatization Ministry, Economy
Ministry, Industry and Trade Ministry and Ministry for Economic
Competition is excessive.  In his view at least two of these could
go.

Racial/Ethic Tensions
Last year, the Interior Ministry reported that racial persecution is
being directed to an ever greater extent against Romanies, or
Gypsies.

According to the ministry, attacks on Arabs or blacks are sporadic,
and there is no evidence of increasing racially motivated criminal
activity against Vietnamese or Jews.  However, attacks against
Romanies appears to be on the rise.

The ministry puts the responsibility for most of the racially
motivated attacks on members of the skinhead movement, which unites
around 1,500 young people.  However, the ministry is unable to
identify which of the numerous skinhead factions actually organizes
the attacks.

According to the ministry, the numerically strongest and most
important skinhead factions - the Patriot League, Bohemia Hammer
Skins, the National Socialist Movement and the National Fascist
Community - tend to restrain their activities to organizing meetings
and concerts or to publishing printed material that indirectly
prompts attacks on Romanies.

The most frequent occurrence of racially motivated activity has been
noted in Prague and northern Bohemia, while it has been falling in
southern Moravia and eastern Bohemia.  In 1994, police investigated
up to 160 racially motivated conflicts, of which 130 were criminal
offenses.

As a result of the sharp increase in racially motivated crimes, the
penal code was amended on September 1 last year to increase the
penalties available for racially motivated crimes.

Social Conditions
The government has increased the subsistence level by an average of
8% as from 1st January 1996.  Given that inflation is different in
various areas, the government reckons the amount "per individual"
will be increased by 7%, while the amount including expenditure on
joint household needs will be increased by 13%.

When fully implemented, the increase will cost Ccr3.2 billion (US$123
million) this year.  The last increase in the subsistence level was
at the beginning of 1995.

Meanwhile, the republic continues to enjoy one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the world.  There were 146,000 people
registered as unemployed at the end of October, equivalent to an
unemployment rate of just 2.8%.  Overall, there were 9,200 fewer
unemployed than in September and 31,000 fewer than in January 1995.

Of the total of 146,000 unemployed, 68,200 (46.7%) received
unemployment benefits worth Ccr1.35billion (US$52 million), 88,000
were women, 22,000 had limited work capabilities and 22,000 were
college graduates.  At the same time, there were over 94,000 job
vacancies.

The highest unemployment rate - 7% - was in the northern Bohemian
district of Most.  The districts of Karvina in northern Moravia and
other northern Bohemian districts of Teplice, Louny and Chomutov
recorded an unemployment rate of over 6%.

Population
The Czech Republic's birth rate was lower than its mortality rate in
1994 for the first time in the republic's history.  According to the
Czech Statistical Office, the social and economic changes wrought by
the transformation process have substantially changed the
reproductive behavior of the people and brought demographic changes
in the Czech Republic into line with those in West European
countries.

One positive feature of this development has been the reduced number
of abortions.  In comparison with 1992, the number of abortions has
dropped by 38.3% last year.  The average marrying age for the Czechs
is also higher, while the divorce rate remains virtually unchanged.

CZECH REPUBLIC
ECONOMY

The Czech Republic became a member of the OECD on November 28 last
year - the first of the post-communist countries to do so.  Although
membership will not bring any direct increase in   economic
assistance it does set a massive seal of approval on the government's
management of the economy since the establishment of the state in
January 19xx and confirms Republic's lead among the former European
members of Comecon.

In line with the OECD stamp of approval, the credit rating agency
Standard & Poor's upgraded its foreign currency debt ratings for the
Czech National Bank and the City of Prague by two points from BBB+ to
A, raising the outlook for both institutions from "positive" to
"stable".

The latest estimates put last year's GDP growth at 4.1%, compared
with 2.6% in 1994 and a forecast 5% plus this year.

Industrial output growth accelerated to 7.8% in the fist nine months
of last year, compared with an annual growth of 2.1% in 1994. The
overall growth rate for 1995 is estimated at 7-7.5%, but a slight
slowdown to 5.5-7% is expected this year.

While the 8% growth rate in construction forecast for 1995 will be
half a percentage point higher than in 1994, a slight fall to 7-8% is
expected this year.  Labor productivity growth has been greatest in
industry and the construction, rising by 8-9% last year.

Domestic demand in real terms grew by 5.1% in the first half of 1995
while external demand grew by 4.4%.  The rate of investment in the
first half of last year was 23.6% in current prices.  The estimate
for the whole year is around 30%.  The rate of engineering
investments was twice that of the rate of investment in construction.
Household savings have been stable at 10-11% of disposable incomes.
No major change is expected in this sector this year.

Inflation
Inflation remains a pressing concern.  As Prime Minister Klaus
pointed out last year, the transformation "cushion" set up in 1991
and which allowed real wages to grow by more than the GDP is no
longer sustainable.  The cushion was created by the liberalization of
prices and trade and the devaluation of the currency, but the room
for maneuver they provided has now been exhausted.

That means, said Klaus, that henceforth real wages must not be
allowed to grow at a greater rate than the GDP if domestic price
rises are to be kept in line with foreign prices.  He pointed out
that up to now the government had consciously set the level of
devaluation, but that too little control had been exercised over
prices.  As a result they had soared.  The rise in prices which began
in the second quarter of 1990 and accelerated after price
liberalization in January 1991 pushed real wages down in the second
quarter of 1991 to 69% of their levels at the beginning of 1990.
This year, said Klaus, real wages should approach the levels of early
1990, while inflation should be around 7.5%.

According to the Czech Statistics Office, inflation in retail prices
is slowing, but only modestly when compared to the acceleration of
economic growth.

After a 10% rise in retail prices in 1994, the rise was a little
slower at 9.7% in the first six months of last year. Prices of food
and public catering rose more than 14% in the first half of last
year, while prices of services rose by 8.3% and prices of other goods
by 6.9%.  The increase in food prices was primarily influenced by the
rising prices of potatoes, meat products and coffee.  The prices of
services were affected by adjustments to government regulated prices
during the first half of the year, including prices for heat,
postage, telephone service, railway fares, energy and gas.

Nevertheless, the moderation in the annual inflation rate continued
through the year with a rate of 9.5% recorded in the first nine
months.  The overall projection for 1995 is an inflation rate of
around 9.5%.

Agriculture
A slight growth in gross agricultural production is expected last
year, following several years of decline.  According to the hectare
yields and crops assessment from the end of October last, basic grain
crops should reach 6.7 million tonnes, a drop of 0.9 % on 1994.  The
wheat yields will be 4.1% higher, but the yields of rye, barley and
oats will be lower than in 1994.

The production of potatoes is expected to be 1.4 million tonnes, an
increase of 14.3% compared with 1994.  The rape crop is expected to
reach 664,000 tonnes, some 46% higher, while sugar beet production
for industrial purposes is estimated to reach 3.5 million, an
increase of 9% on 1994.

Livestock production was slightly lower last year.  It is estimated
that the numbers of cattle fell by 2% and the number of pigs by 0.5%.
The milk yield increased by 4.3% to 11.3 liters per day in the first
half of 1995 compared to the same period of 1994.  According to the
annual estimate, the sale of milk will decline by 3.5% and the sale
of eggs by 0.4%.

Inward Investment
A package of agreements was signed in November enabling foreign oil
companies a stake in Czech refineries.  The International Oil
Consortium (IOC), comprising Agip of Italy, Royal Dutch/Shell of the
Netherlands and Conoco of the USA, signed up to the deal with the
Czech state-owned Unipetrol joint-stock company to acquire a 49%
stake in the Czech Refinery Company (CRS).

The CRS was formed out of a merger of the refining operations of
Czech refinery giants Kaucuk Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov.  The
remaining 51% share in the CRS stays in the hands of Unipetrol, which
in turn is wholly owned by the National Property Fund.

Banking Sector
The Republic's three largest banks reported high profit growth in the
first nine months of 1995.  Komercni Banka, which declared gross
earnings of Ccr6.8 billion, compared with Ccr2.6 billion for all of
last year, recorded the highest profit growth, followed by Ceska
Sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank) with a net profit of Ccr1,194
million, a growth of almost 22% 1994.

The net profit of the third bank, Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB),
was Ccr712 million, 70% of the projected Ccr1 billion in earnings for
this year.  During the same period last year, IPB achieved a net
profit of Ccr584 million while the total for the whole year amounted
to Ccr752 million.

All three banks recorded an equal growth in granted loans and
consequently in reserves.

CZECH REPUBLIC
FINANCE

The state budget ended the first ten months of 1995 with a surplus of
Ccr12.3 billion.  Revenues totaled more than Ccr355 billion and
overall expenditure reached Ccr343.4 billion.  Finance Minister Ivan
Kocarnik said the figures showed the government's overall projections
for the 1995 budget were realistic.  It meant that the prognosis for
the end of the year situation, based on the October figures, was that
revenues to the budget should be met with a possible variation of
plus or minus Ccr1-2 billion.

In November last, the parliamentary budget committee recommended
approval of the proposed state debt of Ccr155.7 billion for 1996.
Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said the debt's nominal value
will remain the same as in 1995 but its share of the GDP would
decrease from the 13% to 11.2%.  The major tendencies in
administering the state debt are to convert the passive trade balance
with foreign countries into a domestic passive balance and to convert
direct loans to securities, Havel said.

He said the state will buy its receivables in foreign countries and
finance it by issuing bonds and treasury bills at a total value of
Ccr40 billion, which will reduce the amount of foreign debt in the
overall debt from 44% in 1993 to 23% in 1996.  For the first time
since 1993 the state debt will not be financed by the government's
National Property Fund.

The state debt totaled Ccr162.8 billion at the beginning of 1993
(17.3% of GDP).  By the end of 1994, the debt had totaled Ccr157.3
billion.  In 1995, Ccr1.6 billion was paid off from the surplus in
the 1994 state budget, bringing it down to Ccr155.7 billion (13% of
GDP).  If the debts of municipalities, funds and other independent
state institutions are added to the debt, the total share of the GDP
would reach 18%.

Havel claimed that the proposal to issue state securities worth Ccr40
billion this year will not influence the behavior of investors on the
Czech capital market.  At the time of this report, parliament had yet
to discuss the budget committee's recommendation.

Foreign Trade
The foreign trade deficit for January-October 1995 stood at Ccr77.4
billion, according to Statistical Office figures.  This is an
increase of Ccr9.2 billion on the January-September period.   Exports
totaled Ccr446.5 billion and imports Ccr369 billion.  In the same
period of 1994, the foreign trade deficit amounted to Ccr8.9 billion.
In October 1995 alone, the deficit stood at Ccr11.9 billion compared
to the deficit of Ccr1.5 billion in October 1994.

Imports grew by 30.2% between January and October 1995 compared to
the same period last year, while exports rose by 10.5%.  Imports of
machines and transport equipment grew by 33.3%, accounting for 35.1%
of total imports.  Passenger cars accounted for 7.5% of total exports
of machines and transport equipment.  Semi-finished products made a
significant contribution to the increase in imports, accounting for
18% of the total.  The volume of imports in this area jumped by 43%
compared with the same period of last year.  Chemical imports
recorded an increase of 33.6%, a share of 13.6% of total imports.

Exports of semi-finished products increased by 19.5% in the
January-October period and accounted for 33% of total exports.
Exports of chemicals rose by 15.9% and accounted for 10.5% of the
total.  Exports of machines and transport vehicles grew 9.9% and made
up 25.6% of all exports.

Overall exports were hit by a drop in exports of industrial products,
mainly consumer goods, which accounted for 12.7% of total exports.
They dropped by 2.7% between January and October 1995 compared to the
same period of 1994.

The volume of foreign trade in agricultural produce increased by 16%
in the January-October period.  However, the Czech Republic's deficit
in this trade amounted to Ccr12 billion, a year-on-year increase of
33%.

Trade with European Union (EU) countries showed a deficit of
Ccr11billion and that there was a Ccr6 billion deficit in trade with
developing countries.  In trade with Slovakia Czech imports rose by
21.1% in the 10-month period to Ccr59.4 billion against exports of
Ccr59.7 billion, to produce a surplus of Ccr300 million, an increase
of 8.6%.  The republic also recorded a surplus with Central European
Free Trade Agreement countries as a whole.

Trade with Russia in the first nine months of 1995 was more than 21%
up on the same period of 1994 and totaled Ccr47billion, according to
preliminary data from the State Statistical Office. Imports from
Russia were worth Ccr36.3billion, a rise of 30%, while exports fell
by 3.4% to Ccr10.6 billion.  Fossil fuels and lubricants accounted
for 77% of the imports.

Exchange Controls
Despite the burgeoning trade deficit, the Czech Republic became the
first of the former European Comecon members to partly liberalize its
capital account transactions on October 1 last year when it
introduced a new foreign exchange act.  The act, which also
introduced full convertibility of the currency for current account
transactions, does not affect the central bank's managed exchange
rate policy.  The value of the crown will continue to be tied to a
currency basket made up of a 65% weighting to the German mark and a
35% weighting to the US dollar. Under this system, the crown is
allowed to fluctuate by 0.5% either side of the set parity.

Under the act, the Ccr100,000 ceiling on the amount of foreign
currency citizens can buy is removed.  In addition, the purchase of
foreign real estate is permitted, companies are allowed to accept
credit from non-resident banks, and some restrictions on direct
investment are eased.  However, other restrictions, such as the ban
on investing in foreign stock markets, remain.  The National Bank's
goal is to achieve full capital account convertibility by the year
2000.

National Bank
The Czech National Bank's (CNB) balance sheet stood at
Ccr530,824,300,000 at the end of October last. The greatest
contribution to the increase in the bank's assets are the greater
outstanding claims on foreign countries, which have increased to
Ccr70,146,800,000.  In addition, receivables from local banks grew
have risen to Ccr72,343,800,000.

Czech National Bank deposits in foreign banks, including securities,
amounted to Ccr258,861,300,000, while other assets amounted to Ccr
5,742,300,000.  Obligations to local banks increased to Ccr
124,613,700,000.  Securities issues were also up at Ccr92,153,000,000
crowns and the volume of obligations for the state budget were also
up at Ccr12,277,300,000 crowns.

Obligations to foreign banks were down at Ccr25,888,600,000 and the
value of issued currency dropped stood at Ccr109,753,300,000.

JANUARY 1996

HUNGARY
POLITICS

The unity of the Socialist led coalition government has been badly
bruised over the last few months.  On the one hand, two ministers
have resigned over their opposition to elements of the tough economic
stabilization plan, while on the other, Finance Minister Lajos Bokros
has threatened to resign over a ruling by the Constitutional Court
that other elements of the recovery plan are unconstitutional.

The first minister to resign, on October 6, was the Labor Minister,
Magda Kovacs Kosa, one of Prime Minster Horn's most experienced
ministers.  Clearly loath to see her go, Horn initially refused to
accept her resignation and pleaded with her to stay on.  However,
Kosa, a former trade union leader in the communist era, was adamant.
In particular she opposed the cuts in sick pay provision put forward
in the restructuring program.

Prime Minister Horn finally accepted the unavoidable on November 28
and replaced Kosa with Peter Kiss, a 36-year old mechanical engineer,
and Socialist Party deputy.  Kiss held senior posts in the Communist
Youth Union (CYU)  and was a founding member of the Progressive Youth
Association (PYU), which was set up when the CYU was wound up in
1989.  He was chairman of the PYU from 1992 to 1995.  He has been a
Socialist member of parliament since 1992.

In the meantime, Education Minister Gabor Fodor resigned on November
24, although he agreed to stay on until the 1996 budget is settled.
On making the announcement, Fodor said he was leaving because he did
not agree with a number of decisions made by the government and
because he did not receive enough support from the prime minister.
He was particularly unhappy that the 1996 budget allocation for
public education is to be cut by Hf7 billion and that further
redundancies are planned in higher education. Fodor is a member of
the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDZS), the junior member of the
coalition.  He is likely to be replaced by another SZDZS member.

However, what could be the hardest blow for Prime Minister Horn's
hopes of pressing ahead with his recovery program came on November 22
when Finance Minister Lajos Bokros offered his resignation.  Bokros's
move, clearly one of exasperation, came after the Constitutional
Court ruled that his move to increase housing loan rates from 15% to
25% was unlawful.  This was the fourth time the Constitutional Court
had ruled that certain measures in the economic stabilization package
are unconstitutional.

Prime Minister Horn refused to accept Bokros' resignation.  Bokros
responded by putting a set of conditions for his continuation as
finance minister and said that whether or not he stays on depends on
the extent to which these demands are met.  In particular he wants
the parliamentary groups of the two government parties the means by
which he can manage the economy without continually running foul of
the constitution.  That means, he said, that the role of every basic
institution has to be reassessed, including interest coordination.
He also wants a compulsory declaration of assets, as he believes
financial savings should be encouraged, while the accumulation of
real estate as a form of investment should not

In essence, Bokros' demands can only be met through fundamental
amendments to the constitution.  That a new constitution is needed
has been long recognized, but little has been done to address the
problem so far.  However, Bokros' latest intervention has reawakened
the debate, with Prime Minister Horn saying it is vital that
preparatory work for a new constitution should start at the beginning
of this year at the latest.

Not surprisingly, the harsh effects of the recovery package has split
the Socialist Party, with its more left-wing members arguing for a
softening of the measures.  So far, however, Horn has remained
adamant that the policy must be kept on track.  This division between
the two wings of the party led to the resignation of Sandor
Czintalan, the executive deputy chairman of the party on November 24,
with effect from this year.

Social Conditions
In November last year, the Central Statistical Office (KSH) published
its first detailed statistical analysis on the economic transition
process.  The study shows that the GDP shrank by one quarter between
1990 and 1994.

Between 1990 and 1995, Hungary received the largest share (US$9.2
billion) of the working capital invested in the transition economies
in Eastern Europe and obtained the largest proportion of joint
ventures.  In the summer of 1995, more than 800,000 private
entrepreneurs were registered in the country, 15% of the active
population.  However, the KSH estimates that 30-40% of private
businesses were set up purely for "tax alleviation".

The age structure of the population is out of balance.  Some 24.8% of
the population is 55 or older, and 34% is below the age of 24.
However, while the middle age group, which makes up only 28.3% of the
population, has to carry the bulk of the taxation and expenditure
burden, it also suffers the highest unemployment and death rates.

Average life expectancy at birth is also falling.  In the case of men
this was 65.9 years in 1960, but only 64.5 years in 1994.  The life
expectancy of women is better at 73.8 years.

Over the 1990-1994 period, the number of people in registered
employment fell by 1.4 million, about 25%. The unemployment rate last
year was 10-11%.  Unemployment is highest among young people at the
beginning of their careers: 23% among women and 31% among men.
Economic activity is overall is 57% (62.6% in the case of men and
51.8% among women).  The employment proportions are distorted by the
fact that, between 1990 and 1995, the number of pensioners working
part or full time decreased by 60% while the number of people in
early retirement or retirement due to disability increased by 15%.

The real income of the population decreased gradually from 1990 to
1993, at which time it stood at 93.3% of the 1985 level.  Real
incomes rose by 3.7% in 1994, but are estimated to have fallen by 11%
in real terms last year.

Inflation, the decrease of real incomes, the increased number of
dependents and falling consumption show a large degree of
differentiation in incomes.  The difference between the smallest and
highest average incomes is more than seven-fold.  In 1994, 45.9% of a
household's income came from the main place of employment.  This
indicates that in an "average family", welfare and illegal incomes
have become dominant.  According to the household panel surveys, some
25% of the population lived below subsistence level in 1994.  People
on low income spent 35.6% of their total spending on food and around
20% on housing.  The proportions are believed to have continued to
deteriorate last year.

However, the data also indicate that from a "quality of life"
viewpoint, the housing situation, telephone supply, the general
possibility to use infrastructural services, the number of cars per
family, and the construction of holiday homes have significantly
improved in the past five years.

The population's health has deteriorated; the proportion of smokers
and alcoholics has soared; and the proportion of people having to
rely on various welfare provisions has increased.   Public safety has
also deteriorated continually since 1990, and the proportion of
violent acts and economic crimes has been increasing among criminal
acts.

HUNGARY
ECONOMY

Despite the considerable pain being inflicted, the austerity package,
introduced in March last year, is bearing fruit.  The GDP is
estimated to have grown by around 2.5% last year, with improvements
in the budget, trade, and current account deficits.  However, there
are indications that the sharp improvements seen in the first half of
the year, started to slow in the second half.

After 8.3% growth in the first half of 1995, industrial production
increased by 7.4 % in July, 2.7% in August and 2.4% in September,
compared with the same periods in 1994.  Both small and large-scale
enterprises increased their output.  As a result, the volume of
industrial production in the first nine months of 1995 exceeded that
of the same period of 1994 by 6.8%.

Industrial production in September was the equivalent of 78.8% of
industrial production achieved in 1994.  At the same time, the volume
of production in September, based on the index containing all the
enterprises and the seasonal adjustments, was 2.6% lower than that
calculated in August.  With the exception of the chemical industry,
the major processing industry sectors registered a fall in
production.  The biggest drop was registered in metallurgy and metal
processing, where production dropped by 14.3%, but the engineering
industry also registered a considerable drop of 8.3%.

Food, beverages, and tobacco production dropped by 4.6%, compared
with August, while chemical industry production increased by 12%.
Production of the mining industry in September 1995 dropped by 8.5%
compared with September 1994, while electric energy, gas, thermal and
water production registered an increase of 10.1%.

Inflation
In November, the government produced an inflation forecast of "only"
19% this year provided the trade unions accepted pay rises averaging
17-18%.  The government also proposed that the social insurance
contribution to be paid by employees this year should be 12% compared
with 10% last year.  Companies, however, should only have to pay a
40- 41% social insurance contribution, as opposed to the current rate
of 44%.

Also in November, the government and unions reached agreement on a
new tax regime.  Employers, however, are unhappy with the deal
because they consider the top tax rate of 48% on the top band of over
Hf900,000 as excessive.  The tax rate on the bottom band, up to
Hf185,000, is 2%.

Foreign Trade
Helped by a 9% devaluation of the forint and an 8% import surcharge,
introduced as part of the recovery package, exports grew by 40% in
the first nine months of last year against a 29% rise in imports.
Nevertheless, with imports totaling to Hf1,367.4 billion and exports
Hf1,076.8 billion at current prices, the trade deficit for the period
was still Hf1.8 billion more than in 1994 at Hf290.6 billion.

According to the National Bank of Hungary (MNB), imports fell by 3%
and exports rose by 4% in comparative prices against the
corresponding period of 1994.  On its figures, in US dollar terms,
exports in the nine-month period were worth US$9.01 billion, up from
US$5.23 billion in the same period of 1994, while imports increased
to US$11.06 billion, compared with US$7.76 billion.  As a result, the
trade deficit fell from US$2.5 billion in the first nine months of
1994 to US$2.05 billion in the first nine months of 1995.

Yugoslav Embargo
Following the decision of the United Nations' embargo committee to
lift its sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the
Hungarian government lifted its compliant restrictions on November
23.  With effect from that date, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV)
announced that was now prepared to transport goods to and from
Yugoslavia and to allow transit shipments to and from Yugoslavia on
its lines.

At the same time, the Hungarian Oil and Gas Rt (MOL) increased the
amount of Russian natural gas transported to Serbia via the transit
station at Kiskundorozsma in southern Hungary to its pre-embargo
level of 186.5 million cubic meters a month.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade estimates that the embargo imposed
on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) on June
3, 1992, has cost Hungary over US$2.2 billion in lost trade.  The
greatest loss, some US$1 billion, was suffered in 1993.  In 1994
Hungary's embargo-related losses amounted to only US$571 million,
while in the first nine months of 1995 they reached some US$300
million.

The losses have been caused partly by a fall in export markets, extra
costs stemming from re-diversion of exports, hindrances to supplies
and cancellation of transit shipments.  A one-off state subsidy of
US$2 million in 1994, issued in a bid to partially compensate firms
for damages caused by the embargo, increased government losses
further.

HUNGARY
FINANCE

In October, the central bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) said
that both Hungary's external payments position and its reserves had
improved significantly, with reserves standing at around US$9.1-9.2
billion.  On that basis the NBH said it had decided to repay US$620
million of its debt to the IMF in November.  Repayment was not due
until the end of 1998.

NBH President Gyoergy Suranyi said the step would improve the
country's debt service ratio and cut interest payments in the coming
years.  As a result of earlier repayment, Hungary's current debt of
slightly more than US$1 billion will fall to US$400 million, which
will be due in and after 1999.  The NBH took up these loans in 1990
and 1991.

The budget deficit picture looks rather less rosy, however.  Under
the austerity package, the budget deficit was supposed to fall to
Hf150 billion last year, equivalent to 6.5% of GDP against 9.5% of
GDP in 1994.  Budget revenue reached a total of Hf1,149.3 billion at
the end of October, and expenditure Hf1,344.9 billion, to produce a
deficit of Hf 195.6 billion.  With the deficit in November and
December expected to be around Hf100-110 billion, the total deficit
for the year could rise to around Hf300-310 billion.

1996 Budget
Finance Minister Bokros presented the draft 1996 budget to parliament
on November 7, with another harsh message for the people.  It was
essential, he said, that there be no rise in the standard of living
this year and that there was a further decrease in incomes in real
terms.  This further belt-tightening was needed, he said, to achieve
the three main aims of the budget - improving the balance of
payments, cutting the budget deficit and public expenditure, and
bringing down inflation.

He said the first economic policy goal is to halt the increase in the
external net debt.  This will require a significant decrease in the
deficit of the balance of payments on the current account, from about
US$2.8 billion in 1995 to less than US$2 billion.  Second, the growth
of internal debts must be slowed significantly.  The budget deficit
target for this year is 4% of GDP.

Exchange Controls
The new foreign exchange regime came into force in January 1, making
the forint a convertible currency as defined by the IMF.  As the
forint was already convertible as far as companies' financial
transfers are concerned, the main effect of the new law will be
enabling private individuals to use the forint for the purchase of
services and commodities abroad.

From January 1, Hungarian citizens holding forint cards or registered
savings deposits will have free access to foreign currency abroad.
However, the tourist allowance of US$800 a year remains unchanged.
Hungarian companies and businesses are now able to found companies or
acquire stakes in existing ones without any limitation.  The stake of
the Hungarian investor, however, should always exceed 10% of the
assets of the foreign venture.  Also, the company to be founded or
acquired should be based in an OECD member state, with which Hungary
has concluded a mutual investment protection agreement.

Hungarian private individuals and businesses wishing to invest in
securities issued abroad will still require a foreign exchange
license.

POLAND
POLITICS

The most interesting feature of the presidential elections on
November 5 and November 19, is not that a former communist
functionary is now the President of Poland, but that Lech Walesa very
nearly secured a second successive term.  When one thinks of quite
how bad he has been as a president - in his five years he engineered
the downfall of seven prime ministers and almost as many governments
while showing an alarming tendency towards authoritarianism -  and
the low esteem in which he has been held by the majority of Poles
over the latter part of his term, that was no mean achievement.

However, that narrow failure was achieved by the same means that
Walesa employed during his presidency - spite, bullying, character
assassination and, last but not least, the unswerving support of the
Catholic church.  It has to be admitted, however, that the eventual
victor, Aleksander Kwasniewski, more than played into Walesa's hands
by being less than candid about his educational background - a silly
pretense in a competition against a man qualified only as a shipyard
electrician, and perhaps an indicator of a suppressed vanity.

Knowing that Kwasniewski was his main challenger, Walesa based his
campaign on one single theme - the threat of a return to communism.
The "reds under the beds" tune was eagerly taken up by the Church,
with priests in every parish lecturing the faithful on the dangers
that stood before them if they were foolish enough to vote the wrong
way.

In the first round of voting on September 27  Kwasniewski gained
35.11% of the vote and Lech Walesa 33.11%.  The other candidates were
Jacek Kuron with 9.22%, Jan Olszewski with 6.86%, Waldemar Pawlak
with 4.31%, Tadeusz Zielinski with 3.53%, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz
with 2.76%, and Janusz Korwin-Mikke with 2.40%.

From then on the heat was turned up under Kwasniewski, who suddenly
found himself being required to account for his personal finances and
the posts he filled in the communist era. Aged 41 and married with
one daughter, Kwasniewski was an activist in the communist Socialist
Union of Polish Students (SZSP) and joined the communist party, the
Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) in 1977.  In 1980-81 he was made
a member of the executive committee of the SZSP main council.

From November 1981 to November 1985 he was editor-in-chief of the ITD
weekly and later the Sztandar Mlodych daily.  He then moved into
government in October 1985 as minister and head of the committee for
youth and physical culture under Prime Minister Zbigiew Messner, and
stayed there through to June 1990 under prime ministers Miczyslaw
Rakowski and Tadeusz Mazowiecki.  From October 1988 to September 1989
he chaired the cabinet's socio-political committee.

After the dissolution of the PZPR he became a member of its
successor, the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).  He became a member of
parliament and head of the SLD caucus in October 1991 and has been
head of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly since
November 1993.

However, despite all this high profile activity, the Walesa camp was
quite unable to come up with any dirt.  Moreover, the "the Reds are
coming" message was undermined both by Kwasniewski's consistent
campaign message that he was committed to maintaining the thrust of
the free-market reforms and the fact that the SLD/PSL (Polish Peasant
Party) government, also former communists, have not been making a bad
job of running the country.

This reduced the Walesa campaign, finally, to complaining about
Kwasniewski's educational qualifications, or lack of them.

Rather stupidly, Kwasniewski had put it about that he had a master's
degree from Gdansk university.  Diligent digging by the Walesa
campaign team proved that he had in fact failed to complete his
course with a masters' thesis and that no degree had been awarded.

But it was too little, too late.  In the run off election on November
19 and with a turnout of 68.23%, Kwasniewski won 9,704,439 votes, or
51.72% of the votes cast.  Lech Walesa came second with 9,058,176, or
48.28%.

Lech Walesa's reaction to his defeat was consistent with the manner
in which he had conducted his presidency - mean-minded and
vindictive.  This man was a hero.  It was Walesa who called the
strike in a Gdansk shipyard 15 years ago which spread nationwide,
created the Solidarity movement, and started the beginning of the end
of the communist dictatorship in Poland.  It was Walesa who proved
the greater man when martial law was invoked in 1981 to crush
Solidarity.  For his courage and foresight in helping to avoid
bloodshed he was rightly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1983, an
award he refused to accept in person while his colleagues remained in
prison.

Despite the failures of his term as president, that background meant
that Walesa could have departed with dignity and able to regain the
"father of the nation" status that was previously his.  Instead, he
mounted an immediate campaign to have the election result set aside
on the grounds that Kwasniewski had lied about his education
qualifications.  Realizing that this appeared a bit weak, they threw
in the spurious allegation of electoral fraud and claimed that
Kwasniewski had suppressed information about his family's shares in
the Poisa insurance company.

At the time of writing, the Supreme Court had received some 600,000
petitions that the presidential elections be annulled on the basis of
one or all of these grounds.  Given that the Walesa camp has yet to
produce any actual evidence of fraud. the pettiness of the
educational qualifications question, for which Kwasniewski had
already apologized, and the fact that Kwasniewski did produce a full
breakdown of his finances, it seems unlikely to us that the Supreme
Court will rule the election illegal.  In that case Aleksander
Kwasniewski should be Poland's next president.

That will give Poland a left-wing president as well as a left-wing
government.  Some Western commentators look upon such a development
with alarm.  We don't share it.  Quite simply, countries like Poland
now have no alternative but to follow the reformist path.  Even the
most backward-looking former communist knows that any retreat would
lead to the political, social and economic chaos that is Russia.
Moreover, all their economic plans, and therefore hope of progress,
are inextricably tied to Western political and financial institutions
such as the IMF, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.  Quite simply, there is no way back.

Rather, we see Kwasniewski's success as positive.  With a like-minded
president, prime minister and government Poland has much better
prospects of achieving harmony in political decision-making than was
ever possible Lech Walesa's presidency.  The key early test of
Kwasniewski's ability to work with Prime Minister Oleksy will be the
way he handles the so-called presidential ministers.

The incumbents of these posts - Andrzej Milczanowski of internal
affairs, Wladyslaw Bartoszewski of foreign affairs, and Zbigniew
Okonski of national defense all tendered their resignations with
effect from December 20.

Religion in Politics
Lech Walesa's defeat in the presidential election was also a defeat
for the Catholic Church, which conducted an all-embracing campaign in
his favor.  Like Walesa, the Church has also been less than
magnanimous in defeat, with the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, calling Kwasniewski a liar in all but name.  Referring to the
fuss over Kwasniewski's educational achievements, the Cardinal
declared that the one thing known about him was that he "publicly
bore false witness".

This was par for the course.  When he cast his own vote in the second
round, Cardinal Glemp said the election was a "choice between a
system of Christian values and a system of neo-pagan values".  After
the election he commented that a society which chose a presidential
candidate who did not represent Christian values was morally sick.
Other priests reportedly said that anyone who voted for Kwasniewski
was committing a sin.

When the electorate decided that "morally sick" or not, it was
plumping for a "system of neo-pagan values", the Church swung into
action behind the campaign to get the elections annulled.  Priests
berated their congregations and dished out protest forms for the
Supreme Court, printed by Lech Walesa's provincial headquarters in
Poznan.

In order to get the message across to those who did not manage to
make it to mass, the Church's own radio station, Radio Marya,
broadcast appeals to the faithful to send in demands to the Supreme
Court that the election be annulled on the basis of Kwasniewski's
"falsification" of personal details.  This was so blatant, that the
National Radio and Television Boradcasting Council was forced to
intervene on the grounds that the radio station was contravening the
terms of its franchise by involving itself in political protest.

Meanwhile, a new political party was registered on November 21.
Called the "Movement for Poland's Reconstruction" it comprises the
former election committee of Jan Olszewski, who gained 6.8% of the
vote in the first round of the presidential election.

Social Conditions
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) estimates that more than one
million Poles work unregistered in the gray, semi-illegal, economy.
GUS concludes from this that the true level of unemployment is
significantly lower than the official figures suggest.  Just under 7%
of the total number of people registered as employed also register a
second job.  However, GUS believes that the true percentage is much
greater than this and that more than two million people were employed
in the gray economy last year.

Men worked unregistered more often than women; urban dwellers did it
more often than the rural population.  It also emerged that one young
person in eleven was employed in the gray economy which employed not
only people with poor qualifications but specialists as well,
although the latter's work in the gray economy was not their main
job.

Rather surprisingly, the GUS study found that horticulture and
agriculture were the largest employers in the gray economy.  Work in
the service sector came second.  Households were the main employers
of gray economy workers, followed by private firms.

The situation on the labor market did improve last year, with the
number of people in work rising by 1.7% up in October 1995 compared
with October 1994, bringing the number of employed to 15,720,000.
However, this is 2,500,000 than in 1990.

The unemployment rate stood at 14.7%, down from 16.2% at the same
time in 1994.  This translates into some 2,600,000 people officially
registered as having no job.  However, if all the unemployed are
counted, including pensioners, the figure rises to 11,600,000, an
increase of 5,00,000 since 1990.  According to demographic forecasts,
the number of people able to work will increase by 680,000 by the end
of this century.

Salaries in the industrial sector grew and after three quarters of
1995, the wages in the economy were 1.6% higher than in
January-September 1994.  However, public sector wages fell 1.5%.  The
Central Statistical Office (CUP) estimates that after the fourth
quarter indexation of pensions, the purchasing power of the benefits
will have risen by 2.8% in the whole of 1995.

POLAND
ECONOMY

The GDP grew by around 6.5% last year, with industrial production
rising by 10%, construction and assembly by 11%, and agricultural
production by 7-9%.  On the downside, inflation was higher than
predicted, while high unemployment, especially among young people, a
continuing crisis in housing, and growing economic disproportion's
between households continued to hold down expectations.

Industrial output rose by 11% in the first 10 months of last year,
compared with corresponding period of 1994.  In the construction
sector, production was 15.5% higher.  However, the number of
completed flats was 20.7% lower than in January-October 1994.

The inflation rate for the month of October was 1.8%.  With hopes of
the monthly rate moderating to an average of 1.5% in the last two
months of the year, the projected annual rate for 1995 was 28% - well
above the 22.7% rate forecast in the 1995 state budget law.

Exports grew by 28.9% in September, compared with a growth of 37.6%
in the first eight months of the year.  Imports also rose rapidly,
however, and at the end of September the deficit in the balance of
payment of commodities amounted to US$930 million.

The state budget deficit stood at ZL6.02 billion in October,
equivalent 68.1% of the figure forecast for the whole year.  Revenues
of over ZL66 billion were collected in the first 10 months of the
year, while the expenditures over this period stood at ZL72.08
billion.

Privatization
The sale to the population of special share certificates in 15
National Investment Funds (NFI), controlling more than 500 state-run
companies, was ceremonially launched on November 22. Polish citizens
were eligible to buy the share certificates at a fee of ZL20 (some
US$8.09) and later exchange units made up of these certificates for
shares in each of the 15 NFI.

On November 27, it was reported that more than 250,000 people had
bought NFI share certificates in the first three days of their
distribution.

Also in November, the Polish Privatization Ministry said that a total
of 914 state enterprises were transformed into State Treasury-owned
joint-stock companies in the period between July 1990 and October
1995.  This accounts for 26.8% of the 3,412 enterprises subject to
this process.  However, only around 150 of the State Treasury-owned
joint-stock companies have been privatized so far.  A total of 1,160
enterprises were wound down under the privatization process and the
liquidation of 1,338 enterprises, which were in poor financial
condition, has begun.

A new version of the privatization bill was due to be submitted to
parliament in the middle of January 1996.  According to privatization
minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, parliament would be able to speed up the
legislative process by suing the deputies' bill already submitted to
the parliamentary speaker.  However, the Constitutional Tribunal has
already ruled that some of the provisions of the deputies' bill
contravene the constitution.  These include the provision making the
privatization of strategic industries dependent on the consent of
parliament.

Another commitment made by the government before the presidential
election was that the privatization of the State Airline LOT would be
ready by the end of this year.  Under the privatization scheme being
prepared by a ministerial committee, the state treasury will retain a
51% stake in LOT and another 20% would be sold on "easy terms" to LOT
employees.

LOT's fleet currently comprises four Boeing 767, 10 Boeing 737 and
seven ATR-72 aircraft.  In 1994, the company carried 1,583,000
passengers, 14% more than in 1993.

Unemployment
In an effort to tackle the unemployment time bomb (see Social
Conditions above), the government approved a draft program for job
creation last November, which unlike the current program, focuses on
eliminating the sources of unemployment, rather than alleviating its
effects.  Its overall aim is to achieve an unemployment rate of 8% by
the year 2000.

Funding for the new program is put at ZL9,000 billion this year,
ZL3,000 billion more than last year.  The additional funds will come
from cutting expenditure on unemployment benefits, which at used up
about 88% of the Labor Fund in 1995.  It is expected unemployment
benefit this year will be linked to minimum pay, rather than to
average pay as has been the case up to now.  The actual level will be
around 88% of minimum pay.

The new program also proposes, for the first time, that unemployment
benefit will be withheld or reduced when an unemployed person refuses
the offer of a job for which he or she is qualified.  Under the
existing system, an unemployed person can refuse up to two job offers
without giving any reason.  From this year school leavers will
receive scholarships for active job seeking and training rather than
automatic benefits.

In order to help in job creation, state support will be given to set
up special economic zones with concessions for investors and
entrepreneurs.  Favorable terms will apply for people starting up new
businesses.  The budget will also help finance regional restructuring
programs and investment projects in areas with high structural
unemployment.

Mining Restructuring
In November last, the government promised there would no mass layoffs
as a result of its plan to restructure the coal mining industry.  The
plan provides for reducing employment by 90,000 miners in the years
1996 through to 2000.  However, miners were assured that 56,000 of
these jobs would disappear through the normal process of retirement,
while the remaining redundancies would be cushioned.

The five-year restructuring plan is designed to put the industry on a
sound economic footing by cutting costs and improving productivity.

Meanwhile, the government has stressed that lignite and hard coal
will remain Poland's main energy sources until the year 2010 despite
the planned increase in the share of gas in energy production.  At
present 43% of energy is produced from lignite, the cheapest source
of energy with prices of up to ZL25 (about US$10) per tonne.  Lignite
resources are estimated at 228 billion tonnes with an annual
extraction rate of 100 million tonnes.

POLAND
FINANCE

Deputy prime minister and finance minister, Grzegorz Kolodko,
prsented the budget bill to parliament on November 22.  This is the
third draft budget to take account of the government's "Strategy for
Poland" program.  The declared aim of the budget is to maintain a
high rate of economic growth, curb inflation, improve living
conditions, increase individual incomes and improve the efficiency of
public services.

Budget funds are increased in real terms, but are not sufficient to
cover all the needs.  Thus, certain areas are prioritized. - public
security, education , restructuring of the countryside, the reform of
the health service, housing construction and culture.

According to the draft budget, the deficit is not to exceed 2.8% of
GDP, while inflation is targeted to fall to 17%.

Japanese Guarantees
In November, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and
Industry announced that Japan has resumed granting guarantees for
exports and investments to Poland.  The decision was made because
Poland has started to fulfill the three conditions for restoring the
guarantees: regular repayment of interests on debts, maintaining good
relations with creditor countries and the International Monetary
Fund; and stabilizing its economic situation.

Japan suspended commercial guarantees for Poland in April 1991
because of the country's growing foreign debt.

JANUARY 1996

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
POLITICS

Prime Minister Meciar's vendetta against President Kovac continues
apace.  So far, however, and to the increasing irritation of the
premier, the president remains in place.  The problem for Meciar is
that he is running out of ammunition.  He has managed to get a
no-confidence vote in the president passed in parliament by virtue of
the simple majority held by his coalition.  However, this still falls
short of the majority required, as all the opposition parties support
Kovac's continuation in office. President Kovac can only be dismissed
by three-fifths of the votes in parliament, i.e. 90 out of the 150
seats.  The government coalition does not have that number.

Confounded in that direction, Meciar has also tried to bring Kovac
down by establishing a parliamentary commission to investigate his
role in bringing down his government in March 1994.  With the
commission packed with his own supporters, it could be counted on to
bring in a damaging enough critique of the president for his
impeachment to be sought.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled in November that such
commissions are unconstitutional on the grounds that the 1989 law
under which commissions are empowered prevents them from starting a
criminal prosecution or obliging people to give evidence at public
hearings.

This is a major blow to the Meciar government, which has set up three
parliamentary commissions, the first, established on  November 3,
1994, the day after Meciar was returned to power, was to look into
President Kovac's role on the earlier dismissal of the Meciar
government; the second was to look into the election lists of the
opposition Democratic Union (DU), whose creation precipitated the
fall of that government, with the aim of excluding it from
parliament; the third, also designed to embarrass the opposition, was
to look at the sale of army pontoons to India; and the fourth, an
investigation into in the car crash in which Alexander Dubcek was
killed in 1992.

All will now have to be wound up.

There has also been the curious case of the kidnapping of the
president's son, Michal Kovac junior.  Although little is currently
known of the detail of this case, it is not beyond the realms of
possibility that this too was part of a plot to discredit Kovac
senior.

The bare bones are as follows: In 1994, Peter Krylov, a Slovak who
had become a German national and who headed a Slovak company called
Technopol was found guilty of fraudulently removing US$2.3 million
from it.  On August 31 last year, Michal Kovac junior was abducted
and taken to Vienna, Austria.  After his arrival, Krylov claimed that
Kovac junior was a partner to the fraud.  Although he made no mention
of Kovac during his trial in 1994, Krylov said that the fraud arose
when Kovac, representing his own company, called Sycko, presented
Technopol with a fraudulent trade deal.

Kovac junior, now released by his captors, but remaining safely in
Vienna, has refuted all the allegations and has claimed that he had
never met Krylov and never discussed any deal with him.  It then
transpired that one of the men involved in his kidnapping was an
agent of the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS), known publicly only
by the name, Oskar F.  The man ultimately in charge of the SIS is, of
course, Prime Minister Meciar.  Despite the weight of evidence
against Oskar F., President Kovac pardoned him from all criminal
charges on November 29.  Was this in return for Oskar F. Disclosing
the full background to the kidnapping?  If so, some very interesting
information may be about to unfold.

With all these various avenues of bringing down the president
apparently blocked or stalled, Prime Minister Meciar is being forced
to consider the final arrow in his quiver - his long-standing threat
to call a referendum on Michal Kovac's fitness to be president.  But
this remains fraught with risk for the premier.  Despite all he has
done to denigrate the president, weaken his powers and diminish his
office - government formulated cut-backs in budget allocations to the
president's office have already forced the sacking of over 40
presidential staff - the people of Slovakia stubbornly continue to
give a higher approval rating to their president than to their
premier.  If Meciar were to call a referendum and lose, his position
would become near untenable.

Racial/Ethnic Tension
Meanwhile, the government has managed to create yet another
confrontation with the European Union and the USA, as well as with
Hungary and part of its own opposition, over its attitude to
Slovakia's Hungarian minority.  The specific point of issue was the
passing by parliament on November 15 of the long debated Language
Law.  A total of 108 of the 142 parliamentary deputies voted in favor
of the law.  All 17 of the deputies belonging to the Hungarian
Coalition voted against, while 17 deputies - all deputies of the
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), plus Lubomir Ftacnik of the
Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) and Viliam Vaskovic of the
Democratic Union - abstained.

At the same time, parliament notably failed to approve the
Slovak-Hungarian basic treaty, which is supposed to form the basis
for good relations and cooperation between the two states.

The Language Law stipulates that Slovak is the only state language in
the republic and orders all state employees to speak Slovak and that
all newspapers and periodicals must be published in the state
language.  Also, all public ceremonies, except weddings, must be
conducted exclusively in the Slovak language. That part of the law
stipulating these obligations came into force on January 1, 1996,
while the section of the law regarding fines and other sanctions for
failure to meet the obligations will become effective on January 1,
1997.

Slovakia's Hungarian minority, which has been campaigning against the
law throughout 1995, sees it as a direct attack on its status and
culture.  However, during the months of national debate on the issue,
the government did promise that the Language Law would be accompanied
by additional legislation guaranteeing support for minority languages
and determining their use in official contacts.  Significantly, this
accompanying legislation was not presented to parliament with the
basic Language Law.

Hungary withdrew its ambassador in protest and raised the matter at
the 47th plenary assembly of the permanent Council of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  On
November 16 the EU parliament passed a resolution condemning the
legislation and warned Slovakia that it must show greater respect for
human rights and democracy or EU aid may have to be suspended.  The
USA issued a note to similar effect.

One would have thought that having provoked earnest criticism both
inside and outside the country, the government would have taken a
conciliatory and assuring tone.  Not a bit of it.  Referring to the
EU resolution as a "demarche" of the kind used by Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union against its neighbors, Prime Minister Meciar said
that Slovakia would never succumb to such threats and that businesses
would be compensated for any losses should the EU's PHARE program to
Slovakia be canceled.

To add even more heat to the fire, SNS deputy Vitazoslav Moric said
that political parties specifically representing Hungarian interests
should be banned and that the Language Law should be used to
counteract the "disproportionate" number of Hungarian schools in the
south of the country.  When asked what would happen to the Hungarian
press from January 1 this year - when all publications are supposed
to be in Slovak - Moric said "there will be no Hungarian press".

Corruption in Government
Meanwhile, the opposition has gone onto the attack, accusing members
of the government of corrupt practices in the implementation of its
privatization program.  One of the first acts of the Meciar
government was to throw out the privatization program produced by its
predecessor and replace it with one of its own.  It then allegedly
packed the Privatization Ministry, the National Property Fund and the
Supreme Supervisory Bureau - the bodies responsible for the program -
with people belonging to or supporting the three coalition parties,
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the Association
of Slovak Workers (ZRS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS).

At the end of November, Mikulas Dzurinda, the deputy chairman of
opposition the Christian-Democratic Movement (KDH), accused ZRS
leader, Jan Luptak, of exercising undue influence on the
privatization process in order to enrich himself and his family, and
other government ministers and their families.  He also accused the
government of selling off state assets to family and friends at a
fraction of their real value.

Dzurinda claimed, for example, that the new private sector owners of
Slovnaft paid down only 1.56% of the company's shares nominal value,
2.35% for Duslo Sala (a chemical plant), 2.75% for the Vysne Ruzbachy
spa, and 0.06% in the privatization of the Zvolen Meat Processing
Plant.  The new owners, said Dzurinda, are now able to sell the
companies abroad and divide the profits on a 50:50 basis - one half
to partial sponsors and one half to their own pockets.

The same cry has been taken up by Peter Weiss, chairman of the
opposition Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), who accused the
government of creating a "privatization sleaze".  He said it was a
scandal that only nine men at the Natinal Property Fund (FNM) are
responsible for privatization decisions and that there is clear
evidence that state assets are being sold off at below market value.
Moreover, he added, privatization is benefiting literally only a few
hundred people.  As a result, a "clientist" political system is being
created in which economic and political power are being welded
together.

At the same time, the opposition parties have demanded an
investigation into whether the former SNS deputy chairman and present
director of Slovenska Poistovna (the Slovak Insurance Company), Peter
Sokol, also has a 25% share in the company which seeking to acquire
it under the privatization program. If so, he would make a clear
profit of Scr5 million (US$170,000) in dividends from the deal.  They
have also asked for an investigation into the high monthly income of
the SNS chairman, Jan Slota.

Questions have also been raised about ministers leaving government to
step straight in to top jobs in state companies on the privatization
list.  In November Marian Mojzis, the State Secretary in the Economy
Ministry, became director-general of the Petrimex joint-stock
company.  He was replaced as Secretary by his adviser, Pavol Hrmo.

Social Conditions
Prime Minister Meciar's peculiar method of governance is clearly
having an impact on the people's perceptions of democracy in action
as opposed to their counterparts in the Czech Republic, according to
a survey conducted in the middle of last year by the Sociological
Institute of the Czech Academy of Science and the Center of Empirical
Researches (STEM).

In answer to the question, "Were people like you better off before
1989?", (i.e. under communism) only 47% of Czechs answered yes,
compared with 73% of Slovaks.  In addition, of the respondents, 75%
of  Czechs believe that the freedom of the individual has increased
since 1989, while the figure for Slovaks was only 54%.  The Czechs
also tend to hold the view that at present they are given better
opportunities to upgrade their standard of living, while Slovaks tend
to believe that these opportunities were better before 1989.

The overall atmosphere in society was valued negatively by 60% of
Czechs and 70% of Slovaks.  More than 90% of those polled in both
countries have noticed deepening social inequalities.

An average Czech has an almost casual approach to unemployment,
believing that sooner or later he or she will be able to get a job
near home.  By contrast, unemployed Slovaks are willing to move to
find a job.  While the unemployment rate slipped under 3% in the
Czech Republic in September, the figure for Slovakia stood at around
13%.

Political Party Developments
At the end of November, Peter Weiss, the chairman of the Party of the
Democratic Left (SLD), which he formed out of the old Communist
Party, announced that he would not seek re-election as chairman, but
would continue to aid the party in a private capacity.

The party only just managed to get into parliament at the last
election and Weiss's leadership has come under a good deal of
internal criticism.

Meanwhile, Jan Langos was elected chairman of the Democratic Party
(DS) at the party's Congress on November 18 with 167 of the 221
votes.  His opponent, the former chairman, Peter Osusky, received 46
votes.

New Borders
The negotiation of new border agreements with the country's
neighbors, necessitated by the separation from the Czech Republic on
January 1, 1993, are nearing completion.  The only borders to undergo
actual changes are with the Czech Republic and Hungary, and involve
452 and 209 hectares respectively.  The changes in the course of the
Slovak-Hungarian border are due to the beds of the Ipel, Slana and
Roznava rivers gradually changing their course since 1965.  The
Slovak-Hungarian agreement is apparently ready for approval.

Under the new agreements, Slovakia's borders measure 1,714.61
kilometers.  The longest section is the Hungarian border (678
kilometers), followed by Poland (547.1 kilometers), Austria (109 km),
and Ukraine (98.5 km)  The Slovak-Czech border is 285 km long, but
will be 33.21 kilometers less  after the new agreement is passed.

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
ECONOMY

Industrial output in September 1995 was 13.2% higher than in
September 1994, according to data from the Slovak Statistical Office.
In the first nine months of the year, the total output of Slovakia's
manufacturing industry, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was
8.4% higher than in the same period of 1994 and amounted to Scr362.2
billion.

The construction industry's output in September 1995 was up by 1.7%
on September 1994.  In the first nine months of 1995 the construction
industry's output rose by about 3.9% on the same period of 1994 and
the industry's projects were worth about Scr36.3 billion.

Farming enterprises' turnover in September 1995, calculated at
current prices without corn for seed and seedlings, was 7.9% down on
the same period of 1994.  In the nine-month period, farmers earned
Scr21.6 billion, excluding corn for seed and seedlings, and their
sales were 3% up on the same period of 1994.  Although there was a
1.4% decline in crop production, this was offset by a 5.2% growth in
the sale of animal products.

Retail trade, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was 16.6%
higher in September 1995 than in September 1994.  In the first nine
months, retail sales amounted to Scr199.4 billion, a rise of 19.9% on
the same period of 1994.  The retail trade annual rise, calculated at
inflation-adjusted prices, amounted to 8.1%.

Private businesses accounted for 63.7% of the manufacturing industry
output and for 80.6% of the
construction industry output.

The draft budget for 1996 (see FINANCE section below) projects a GDP
growth this year of at least 5%, with inflation falling to 6-8%.

Unemployment
Unemployment remains a pressing concern.  The unemployment rate did
fall to 12.8% in October last, the first time it had been below 13%
since the end of 1994.  In the month there were 82,472 unemployed
people receiving state support in the month, 1,942 less than in
September.  Of the unemployed people 53.1% were women, 7.7% people
with limited ability to work and 18.3% school leavers.  There were
325,490 registered job seekers in the month.

Although the current unemployment rate compares favorably with the
majority of the other former Comecon countries in Eastern Europe, it
is embarrassingly high compared with the Czech Republic, the only
comparison that counts for most Slovaks.  In an attempt to ensure
that the rate continues to move downward through 1996, the government
is to introduce a new system of unemployment benefits this year.

The old system of a single benefit scheme for all registered
unemployed people has been replaced by a two-tier system to
distinguish between those who are not to blame for losing their jobs
and who want to work and those who do not want to work.  This will be
coupled with a change in social policy through the introduction of a
"poverty" level in addition to the existing "subsistence" level.  The
poverty level will be considerably lower than the subsistence level
and will be applied to those who refuse to accept a job.

Inward Investment
The total volume of foreign investments in Slovak companies had
reached Scr19.8 billion (US$660.8 million) by the end of September
1995, a 12.8% increase since the end of July.  Foreign capital was
invested in 8,469 companies, with the largest volumes going to
industry, trade, financing and insurance companies.

The most important investors, investing over Scr1 billion, were from
the following countries (ranked according to volume of investment):
Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, the USA, France and Great
Britain.  The situation in foreign investments during the third
quarter of 1995 was influenced by the establishment of three branches
of foreign banks in Bratislava, the Austrian Bank Austria (name as
received), the Czech Komercni Banka and the US Citibank, with
contributions of British capital.

Gas Pipeline
It was agreed in November that the new pipeline to carry gas from the
Yamal deposit in northern Russia via Belarus and Poland to Germany
will incorporate a branch line to Slovakia.  The line, which will run
for 233 kilometers from Poland will probably be built by a
Slovak-Russian joint venture.

The Russian gas company involved, GAO Gazprom, also showed interest
in extending the current transit gas pipeline from Slovakia via
Hungary and Slovenia to Italy.  Slovakia will buy 5.1 million tonnes
of Russian crude oil next year.  In addition, Russia has reportedly
agreed to supply Slovakia with natural gas from Turkmenistan through
its gas system.

Coal Industry Privatization
Prime Minister Meciar said in November that the coal mining and the
coal engineering industry in
Slovakia's most important coal region, Horne Ponitrie (the Upper
Nitra region), will be privatized.  He said that in line with
election promises, mine employees and Prievidza citizens would be
able to purchase the region's collieries for a nominal one Slovak
crown.

The mine employees and the citizens of Prievidza will receive state
privatization bonds which they will be able to exchange shares.  The
privatization of the region's engineering industry, due to be
implemented concurrently with the privatization of coal mining, will
be treated separately and with a different legal method.

The Horne Ponitrie region is suffering from an overall decline in
production due to the slow transformation and decline in the coal
mining industry.  As a result unemployment in the region has soared
and now stands at around 9,240.

State Railway
The state-owned Slovak Railways is expected to have incurred a loss
of around Scr3 billion last year from its passenger services.  The
government will only cover up to Scr1.73 billion of this loss due to
limited resources in the state budget.  Slovak Railways expect that a
similar situation will also arise this year when the costs of
operating passenger transport will be Scr5.051 billion, while sales
will only reach Scr1.63 billion.   However, the state is committed to
covering only Scr2.03 billion of the expected Scr3.42 billion loss,
according to the proposed budget for 1996.

Railway passengers in Slovakia now only pay 43% of the real cost of
transport.  The real cost per person per kilometer is Scr1.16, but
passengers pay only Scr0.50.

JANUARY 1996

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
FINANCE

Finance minister Sergej Kozlik has predicted that the budget deficit
for 1995 will be much lower than forecast.  In late November the
deficit stood at Scr7 billion, compared with a target figure of Scr27
billion for the year as a whole.  Kozlik said that the reason for the
lower budget deficit was the fact that only 86% of the planned
budgetary expenditure had been used and that 93% of the planned
revenues had been collected.

1996 Budget
The draft budget for 1996 approved by the government in November
projects a deficit of Scr27 billion, with revenues put at Scr162.4
billion and expenditures at Scr189.4 billion. that debt repayment
spending will be Scr19 billion this year, the fiscal position of the
state budget means a deficit of 1.5% of GDP.

The budget makes no provision for rent, fuel or energy price rises
this year as part of the government's policy of bearing down on
inflation.  The inflation rate has followed a downward trend of late,
falling from 9.8% year-on-year in August to 7.9% year-on-year in
October.

As part of the inflation strategy, parliament approved a new price
law in November, which gives the Finance Ministry and local
authorities at district and regional levels the right to regulate the
prices of goods and commodities.  The new law enables state officials
to regulate prices in cases of "economically justified" costs or
"adequate profits".

Critics claim that the law could lead to a situation where the state
would be in charge of price setting.  The opposition argued that the
law was only just within the bounds of the market economy system
because it empowered state officials to decide on the "adequacy" of
prices, costs and profits.

However, spending on the intelligence service (SIS) is to rise by 50%
to Scr760 million (US$29 million).  The money allotted to the
government will more than double, from Scr150 million in 1995 (US$5.8
million) to Scr414 million (Scr15.9 million).

On the other hand, the President's Office will again receive less,
Scr97 million (US$3.7 million) as against Scr121 million (US$4.65
million) in 1995.  All part of Prime Minister Meciar's strategy to
curtail and diminish the presidency by whatever means available.

Foreign Trade
A surplus of Scr3.5 billion was recorded on the balance of foreign
trade in the first 10 months of last year.  Exports were worth
Scr210.7 billion, an increase of Scr37.6 billion or 21.7% on the same
period of 1994.  Imports were worth Scr207.2 billion, an increase of
Scr35.8 billion or 20.9% on the same period of 1994.

The largest share of exports went to the Czech Republic (35.4%),
Germany (18.9%), Austria (5%), Italy (4.7%), Hungary (4.6%), Poland
(4.4%), the Russian Federation (3.6%), Ukraine (2.1%), France (2%)
and the Netherlands (1.7%).

Exports to the EU countries went up by Scr18.5 billion (30.5%) and
made up 37.6% of total exports.  Exports to the OECD countries were
up Scr18.5 billion (27.4%) compared with the same period last year
and constituted 40.9% of total exports.

Imports mainly came from the Czech Republic (28.1%), the Russian
Federation (16.8%), Germany (14.3%), Austria (5.2%), Italy (4.5%),
Poland (2.9%), the USA and France (each 2.3%), Hungary (2.2%), the
Netherlands (1.7%) and Ukraine (1.5%).

A total of 34.5% of Slovak imports came from EU countries, which is
Scr15.2 billion (27%) more than in the first 10 months of 1994.  The
share of imports from OECD countries stood at 40.9%, an increase of
Scr18 billion (26.9%) compared with the same period of 1994.

Reserves
The Slovak National Bank's currency reserves stood at nearly US$3
billion at the end of October, US$900 million of which had been
accumulated during the first half of 1995.

The hard currency reserves of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)
amounted to US$3,045 million on November 20, an increase of US$1.3
billion compared to the reserves held on January 1, 1995.

The sum total of hard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakia
amounted to US$4.55 billion on November 20, of which all commercial
banks in Slovakia held US$1.55 billion.  According to the 1994 Annual
Report of the NBS, at the end of December 1994 the NBS's hard
currency reserves stood at US$1,745 million.  The sum total of the
hard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakia amounted to
US$3,093 million, of which all commercial banks held US$1,348
million.

Banking sector
The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) announced last year that almost
half of all loans extended by Slovak banks will not be repaid in
their full nominal value.  The total volume of the loans extended by
Slovak banks by the end of August last year amounted to Scr276.2
billion.  About Scr130 billion of this sum or 47% are presumed to be
doubtful loans, which are unlikely to be repaid in full, while some
Scr86 billion of these loans are considered as bad or
"irrecoverable".

If these estimates are correct, the total volume of doubtful loans is
almost as big as the state budget revenues or nearly 30% of
Slovakia's annual GDP.  The three biggest Slovak banks, which jointly
hold about 70% of all loans, also hold 90% of doubtful and bad loans.
These are:  Vseobecna Uverova Banka (the General Credit Bank),
Slovenska Sporitelna (the Slovak Savings Bank), and Investicna a
Rozvojova Banka (the Investment and Development Bank).

According to an NBS analysis, the assets of the biggest Slovak banks
are Scr19 billion below the level required to cover their risks.  The
Finance Ministry believes that the current high interest margins and
the new income tax law, due to give a boost to the process of risk
assets creation, should help the banks accumulate more risk assets.

Although banking sector representatives accept this argument, they
say that other legislative steps will have to follow that would
address the companies' problems as well as the bad loans problem.

EBRD Credit
In November, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) and the Slovak commercial bank Istrobanka have signed an
agreement on the opening of a DM30 million credit line for
Istrobanka, making it Slovak commercial bank, after Tatra Banka and
Polnobanka, to be selected by EBRD as its partner for providing
investment loans.

The money drawn from this credit line will be used for private sector
projects.  Istrobanka's clients will have a chance of receiving a
credit ranging from DM0.5- 8 million per project on the estimated
repayment period between seven and eight years.
