<h3>Determination of eligibility for services for a student with speech 
impairment not limited to use of academic criteria</h3>

<p>A court held that a student with a speech impairment was improperly 
denied eligibility. The court ruled the 7-year old student whose voice 
was often strained and fluctuated in pitch was eligible for special 
education services because the condition affected his ability and desire 
to communicate with others although he was performing academically at 
the level of his peers.

<p>The parents challenged the school district's refusal to declare the 
student eligible. Although the district admitted the child did not have 
a normal voice, it disputed that his condition adversely impacted his 
education because the  child was making passing grades.

<p>The court cited two reasons for its decision: (a) an advisory note to 
the federal regulations which states that in evaluating communicative 
speech disorders, the examiner must "focus on an objective level of 
speech ability and the observation of speech behavior" and (b) OSEP 
policy letters which have stated that eligibility for a speech/language 
impairment could not be "conditioned" on the existence of deficient 
academic performance. The court noted that federal regulations do not 
allow the use of a single procedure as an eligibility criterion but 
required an investigation of data from a number of sources. The court 
stated that educational performance is not determined solely on the 
basis of academic criteria but indulged the development of 
communication, social skills and personality.

<h3>Failure to implement student's IEP resulted in denial of FAPE</h3>

<p>The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) ruled that in the case  of Ocean 
View (CA) Elementary School District, 23 IDELR 903 (OCR 1995), the 
failure of the district to implement the individualized education program 
(IEP) of a student with disabilities denied the student a free 
appropriate public education (FAPE). OCR determined the district 
violated the student's rights under both Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) when it failed to implement the IEP consistently.

<p>In their investigation OCR found confusion among the student's 
teacher, the instructional aide and other school district personnel 
regarding the implementation of certain provisions of the IEP. 
Inconsistency in implementation of an IEP is difficult to prove, but it 
was apparent in this instance that the school personnel who were to 
implement the IEP did not have the same understanding of how the student 
should be served.

<h3>District did not discriminate against student with disability by 
giving failing grade in physical education</h3>

<p>The parent of a student with dyslexia complained to OCR that her 
daughter was discriminated against because she received a failing grade 
in physical education. OCR found that it was the student's refusal to 
participate in physical education which resulted in her failing grade. 
Although the student had received an "F" on a written test in physical 
education, the examination grade had not been averaged into her physical 
education grade because of her dyslexia. The teacher had provided 
assistance to the student in opening the combination lock to her locker, 
but the student repeatedly failed to dress for class despite notice that 
doing so would result in failure.
