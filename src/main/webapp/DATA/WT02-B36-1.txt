N.Y. RESTRUCTURING RECOMMENDATION: ISO TO OVERSEE MOVE TO RETAIL ACCESS

Establishing an independent system operator to formalize wholesale
competition in New York and ensure transition to retail access is a key
part of restructuring the state's electric industry, according to a state
judge and a state regulator.
   The recommended decision in the state's Competitive Opportunities
proceeding also calls for separating transmission and distribution from
generation and for recovering stranded costs with an access charge imposed
by a distribution company (Doc. No. 95-E-0952).
   The recommendation was filed Dec. 22 by the state's Dept. of Public
Service Administrative Law Judge Judith Lee and Ronald Liberty, deputy
director for the Energy and Water Division. Subject to review by the Public
Service Commission, it aims to lower New York's high electricity rates and
keep industry in the state.
   No timetable for the ``as soon as possible'' transition to retail access
has been established, however, a PSC spokesperson told Northeast Power
Report.
   Key parts of the more than 200-page review are:
   -- Strandable costs ``may be made unrecoverable by the transition from
regulation to a competitive market for electricity.'' These costs could be
recovered by a separate mechanism outside the market, such as a
non-bypassable access charge or wires charge imposed by a distribution
company.
   -- Transmission and distribution should be separate from generation ``in
order to limit the exercise of market power,'' and T&D companies will need
to serve all would-be buyers in the short term.
   Lee said she saw as ``critical'' the reliability of the bulk power
system, noting that it should not be sacrificed in any way in order to
achieve the potential price reduction that may be associated with a system
of retail access. Therefore, ``effective competition at the wholesale level
should be established first, with an eye toward adding retail access as
rapidly as possible once a market is established and reliability is
ensured.''
   Lee's recommendation was a ``tremendous disappointment'' to New York
industrials ``and to any advocate of full and open retail competition,''
said Barbara Brenner, counsel to Multiple Intervenors, the industrial users
trade group. ``It delays, without schedule, retail competition and, in
fact, appears to delay even the implementation of wholesale competition for
two years,'' she said.
   Utilities, on the other hand, like the proposal. Their trade group, the
Energy Association of New York State, applauded the law judge's
recommendation as ``a thoughtful approach to what is clearly an incredibly
complex series of issues.''
   ``Wholesale competition to the extent that the Energy Association has
been talking about is far more significant than what might exist today in
New York--and in most other places,'' said Howard Shapiro, the
association's president.
   On the legislative front, New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
(D-Manhattan) unveiled a proposal calling for an immediate freeze of
electric rates and setting a goal of cutting them by 25%.
   Further, under Silver's plan, utilities would be required to buy power
in a competitive wholesale market by September 1997. By September 2000,
``if conditions ensuring safety, reliability...and access to a reasonably
priced power are met,'' customers would be able to choose their own power
suppliers.
   Industrials reacted in similar fashion to Silver's proposal. ``We're
studying [it] carefully. We don't think it moves fast enough. We would like
to see retail competition by Jan. 1, 1997,'' Brenner said.
   The Energy Association's Shapiro said he was pleased that at least
Silver recognized that ``competition alone doesn't produce a dramatic
short-term reduction of rates and that other issues must be addressed.''
   Gov. George Pataki also weighed in on the issue in his Jan. 3 State of
the State address, calling restructuring ``a major sea change facing our
state and our nation,'' and citing the Long Island Power Authority's plan
to take over Long Island Lighting (NPR, 22 Dec '95, 1).

PSNH, CONNECTICUT VALLEY ELECTRIC SLAM N.H. PUC RULING ON UTILITY
FRANCHISES

   In a closely watched case, Public Service of New Hampshire and
Connecticut Valley Electric have filed detailed arguments to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court against a June 1995 Public Utilities Commission
determination that electric utilities in the state do not have exclusive
franchises.
   In a Dec. 18 filing in a case involving Freedom Energy's request to
compete against PSNH for retail customers (Doc. No. 95-610), PSNH charged
that a series of major state court opinions and legislative actions since
1911 had created a legal pattern ``incorporating the economic model of a
regulated monopoly in which service by a single provider was the essential
principle.''
   PSNH listed a long series of instances in which the state acted on the
assumption that exclusive utility franchises existed and said that the 1995
PUC decision against exclusive franchises ``in effect overlooked the forest
for the trees.''
   ``By insisting on a specific `tree' explicitly providing for exclusivity
in electric utility franchises,'' PSNH said, ``the PUC majority missed the
forest of authority'' that created an economic model based on exclusive
franchises.
   PSNH also said the court should dismiss PUC claims that the state
constitution guaranteed open competition in the electric utility sector.
   It said previous court decisions had recognized the unique nature of
electric service and the practical need for monopolies in the sector. The
creation of the PUC in 1911 to oversee such ``sanctioned monopolies'' was
in harmony with the other constitutional safeguards against monopolies.
   PSNH also invoked the state's ``administrative gloss'' doctrine, saying
that the PUC's consistent rulings in the past in favor of exclusive
franchises plus the legislature's failure to interfere with the
interpretation created a ``binding gloss'' which deprived the PUC of the
right to unilaterally change its policy now.
   It said this administrative gloss approach was needed because nothing in
state law explicitly authorized either competing franchises or exclusive
franchises. This ambiguity made the long-standing PUC interpretation of the
law the crucial element in determining current law.
   In a third major argument, PSNH said that the fact that the New
Hampshire legislature passed a detailed bill in June 1995 creating a
process to study ways to increase electric industry competition showed that
the PUC did not have authority to make decisions on the issue.
   It said that the authority given to the PUC in the bill to carry out a
retail wheeling pilot was restrictive and fell ``far short'' of the powers
claimed by the PUC to set policy.
   Instead, PSNH said, the message from the 1995 law was that ``the
legislature would set policy while the PUC would assault the legislature by
gathering relevant information through the pilot program.''
   In its filing to the state Supreme Court, CVE said that the PUC decision
on the franchise issue ``created an imbalance in the regulatory equation''
in the state. ``The PUC order revokes the utility's right to be the
exclusive supplier within its service territory, but does not relieve the
utility's corresponding obligation to serve all customers regardless of
economics.''
   CVE also noted that the legislature had a record of involvement in the
policy issues of utility franchise exclusivity and that unless it delegated
authority in this field to the PUC, the court should assume the power
itself.
   Representatives of the PUC and Freedom Energy are expected to file their
comments to the court in mid-January. The court will hear oral arguments in
the case in February (NPR, 10 Nov '95, 10).

GM PLANS 25-MW COGENERATION PROJECT AT N.J. PLANT, OWNED, OPERATED BY
QUIXX

   General Motors wants an outside party to install and operate a 25-MW
cogeneration system at its Linden, N.J., truck plant so it can cut costs
and focus on its manufacturing business.
   The project would be developed by Quixx Corp., a subsidiary of
Southwestern Public Service. Based in Amarillo, Tex., Quixx would own and
operate the plant, although GM said it may take an ownership stake. Most
power would be used in house, though some excess would occasionally be sold
to Public Service Electric & Gas, which now supplies the plant. PSE&G
charges industrials about 7.5 cents/kWh.
   GM has asked the N.J. Board of Public Utilities for an order declaring
that the project would not be regulated as a utility (Docket No.
EE95100486). This is a technicality that non-utility generators usually
seek in New Jersey, and GM pointed out that the plant would not supply
power or steam to other end users. However, the company is asking the BPU
for expedited treatment of the declaration, ``due to intense economic
pressures and the planning needs of GM Linden for a prompt go/no go
ruling.'' According to GM, the factory serves as its export plant for small
trucks and sport vehicles, a market ``which seems to gain new competitive
entrants each year.'' It expects that the cogeneration plant could be
brought on-line in 18-24 months.
   The factory was built in 1936, and it still uses the original thermal
plant to provide steam, heat and compressed air for vehicle production. GM
attorneys Potter & Dickson, Princeton, N.J., pointed out that the plant
employs 2,700 workers, and said, ``Without the [project], the long-term
viability of the Linden assembly plant remains jeopardized by competition
internal to General Motors and from competition by other producers of small
trucks and sport utility vehicles.'' Aside from the energy savings--which
were not disclosed--shutting down the old oil-fired boilers would reduce
emissions and compliance costs.
   Thomas Noble, manufacturing engineering manager, told the BPU that the
old energy plant will have to be replaced in the near future, and that such
an investment would detract from the plant's manufacturing business.
Instead, he said, ``installation of a new, state-of-the-art, on-site total
energy system, operated by a third party of experts, will enable GM Linden
plant managers and personnel to concentrate their time, attention and
investment decisions on GM's core business...''

MMWEC SEES TRANSMISSION, MARKET POWER ISSUES AS IMPEDIMENT TO NEPOOL
REFORM

   Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric, saying it was speaking for
consumer-owned utilities in New England, has warned the investor-owned
utilities in the region that no reform of the New England Power Pool system
will be possible without resolution of outstanding transmission and market
power issues.
   In comments presented to the NEPOOL executive committee, MMWEC said that
the ``NEPOOL Plus'' plan for revising pool operations proposed by Northeast
Utilities veered from the group's basic purpose of assuring reliability at
the lowest possible cost for all consumers (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 3).
   It said that while NU's ``piecemeal'' plan would introduce bidding for
dispatch, it would also ignore other key issues.
   MMWEC predicted the NU plan would ``ultimately fail'' unless it included
a comprehensive solution to all pool issues. It said that the NEPOOL
management committee, where all members were directly represented, should
debate the proposed changes, rather than the executive committee.
   MMWEC said the bid-based pooling system would not work unless there was
regional network service, under which all participants had equal access and
equal pricing.
   It said this could be done through contractual arrangements such as
those discussed in previous regional transmission group negotiations. Such
a system, run by a neutral entity, should eliminate unequal contract path
and pancake pricing problems while still compensating owners of
transmission for their investments, MMWEC said.
   A bid-based system, as proposed by NU, would not work well in a truly
competitive market, MMWEC said, because larger NEPOOL members would have
the ability to manipulate the system by controlling either a significant
amount of generation or specific functional resources, such as 10-minute,
non-spinning reserves.
   MMWEC said manipulative actions or improper responses to market signals
by large members ought to be prohibited. It said that this rule could be
policed by a neutral body which would hear complaints and levy sanctions.
   The muni group said that pool rules should be made in the interest of
the end user and that voting representation should remain limited to
members which serve retail load. This would avoid giving power inside the
group to players in the market which did not have a direct responsibility
toward retail customers.
   MMWEC said that any plan for bid-based dispatching must require
disclosure of spot market and bilateral deals, including price information
and availability of bids.
   It noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already
raised questions about NEPOOL transmission rules, most recently rejecting a
plan to allow increased bilateral energy sales in the region because the
transmission implications had not been addressed.
   While the MMWEC proposals present a challenge to the large New England
utilities, they also contradict many points contained in the NEPOOL reform
plan proposed by the Competitive Power Coalition of New England which calls
for more rights in NEPOOL for non-utility members, the formation of an
independent system operator for transmission and a totally free market
approach to the pool.

NUG/MARKETER GROUP WANTS INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR TO REPLACE NEPOOL

   The debate over the future of the New England Power Pool heightened last
week when the Competitive Power Coalition of New England circulated a draft
proposal calling for replacing NEPOOL with an independent system operator
(ISO).
   Titled ``A Blueprint for a Competitive Electricity Supply System in New
England,'' the report said it offers ``an alternative to mere incremental
adjustments currently being proposed by NEPOOL incumbents.''
   The Boston-based advocacy group for independents and power marketers
dropped out of NEPOOL reform talks in October to pursue its own plan
because it believed the group was moving too slowly, according to John
Howat, CPC executive director. Northeast Utilities recently proposed a more
modest reform that introduces bidding for NEPOOL dispatch in a two-phase
process. Called ``NEPOOL Plus,'' that plan has won widespread support among
NEPOOL members, according to NU (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 3).
   CPC planned to meet this week with utilities to discuss its blueprint,
which it describes as ``evolutionary not revolutionary,'' keeping the
strong elements of NEPOOL and transforming them into an independent system
operator. For example, the ISO would probably maintain the same personnel
that are now employed by NEPOOL and use the same facilities.
   However, the ISO would coordinate transmission delivery based on
contracts between buyers and sellers, rather than NEPOOL's current economic
dispatch. A FERC-regulated network, it would have no corporate or business
link with utilities or other market participants and no members, governance
board or voting rules.
   To maintain system reliability, the ISO would control some generation,
procured through competitively secured contracts, or calls on generation
assets.
   The blueprint envisions an electric power system with six components:
supply, supply aggregation, system operation, load aggregation,
distribution and consumers.
   While delivery would be provided at regulated prices, supply would be
fully competitive, with energy service providers serving as the chief
interface with customers. The report envisioned many entities filing the
energy service provider role, including marketers, aggregators and utility
spin-offs.
   The energy service providers would contract with generating companies,
transmission companies and distribution companies to buy power and delivery
services that could then be packaged and resold to retail customers. Energy
service providers might also provide additional services, such as bundling
a power sale with metering and associated equipment services.
   The blueprint also gives customers the option of bypassing the energy
service provider and buying power directly from the wholesale market, an
approach more likely to be pursued by large customers than small
customers.
   CPC recommended that utilities unbundle generation, transmission and
distribution assets through divesture, a concept that some major New
England utilities have already rejected. CPC said it supports stranded
investment recovery and opposes forced contract re-negotiation between
independents and utilities, an approach pushed by some utilities to lower
stranded costs.
   ``Our members are willing to look at renegotiations where a
renegotiation would result in a mutually beneficial position,'' Howat said.
``A pressure for forced renegotiation is really not a good way to move
toward a system that is based on contracts. What does that say to the
financial community?''
   ``Clearly had prices gone up dramatically, instead of gone down, and had
demand for power risen dramatically, I don't think the entities that are
clamoring now for renegotiations of contracts would be singing that tune,''
he said.
   CPC expects to issue a final report in early January.

D.C. PSC OPENS COMPETITION PROCEEDING; SEEKS WRITTEN COMMENTS BY END OF
MARCH

   The District of Columbia Public Service Commission has opened a formal
proceeding on electric competition and is seeking written comments from
interested parties (Case No.945). Those will be due 90 days after the PSC
issues its order on the Dec. 15 pre-hearing conference, which is expected
early in the new year.
   In launching the case, the PSC cites open-access rules proposed by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last spring. Although these only apply
to wholesale transactions, ``the impact that the adoption of the rules
would have on retail electric sales should not be overlooked,'' the PSC
stated. Although electric rates from Potomac Electric Power are low for the
region--averaging 7.2 cents/kWh--the PSC ``recognizes that, if this fact is
to remain true, the commission must be prepared to take steps to allow a
greater reliance on competition and customer choice.''
   Further, ``increasing competition among sellers of electricity will
result in increasing choices for buyers,'' the PSC said. However, it could
also affect reliability, planning, economic development and the
environment. Allowing retail competition could also allow new suppliers to
lure away PEPCO's larger commercial customers, stranding fixed costs that
would fall on remaining ratepayers. Therefore, the PSC wants to explore
these issues before taking any steps to open the system.
   Among the questions that the PSC would like to address are: whether the
PSC should refrain from instituting retail wheeling until wholesale markets
develop; what impact retail wheeling would have on various classes of
ratepayers; what specific steps the PSC could take to encourage wholesale
and retail wheeling; and whether the commission should order PEPCO to
disaggregate generation, transmission and distribution.
   In addition, the PSC would like estimates on how much capacity would be
stranded, and how those costs should be allocated. It also seeks comments
on whether demand-side management and environmental programs should be
continued under competition, and how they would be funded. PEPCO said it
welcomes the investigation, though it noted that questions regarding the
role of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) must be
addressed by FERC.
   Comments should be addressed to the Commission Secretary at the District
of Columbia Public Service Commission, 450 Fifth St., N.W., Washington,
D.C., 20001. Correspondence should reference Case No. 945 and the title
``In the Matter of the Investigation into Electric Services, Market
Competition and Regulatory Policies.''

GREEN MOUNTAIN POWER RESTRUCTURING PLAN WOULD PUT GENERATION UP FOR BID

   Green Mountain Power has filed a restructuring plan with Vermont
regulators which proposes to use an auction system to determine the value
of stranded generation investments and power purchase commitments.
   The auction would not be a forced asset divestiture and the owner of the
generation assets being sold could bid against other groups to retain
them.
   The plan, filed with the Vermont Public Service Board Jan. 2 (Doc. No.
5854), would deregulate generation and the sale of electricity while
keeping transmission and distribution service under state regulation.
   Retail customers would be offered competitive options for power
supplies, one of which would be a ``basic electric service package,''
including regulated services from the franchise distribution company and
``lowest cost available'' power supplies.
   GMP said the division between regulated and competitive sectors would
let the marketplace establish pricing for those parts of electric service
which would benefit from competition while preserving a single provider
system where that would be more efficient.
   In a statement, GMP said the auction approach is intended to avoid a
major hang up over the issue of how to determine stranded costs and
revenues. Instead, it said, the market would take care of that
determination.
   GMP said its plan was based on 14 principles for restructuring reached
last July by a Vermont state roundtable on electric industry restructuring.
This included utility recovery of ``reasonable'' stranded costs and the use
of a monthly wires charge to fund conservation, renewables and low income
support programs.
   GMP said that under its plan, the distribution companies would have
direct responsibility for carrying out such service programs.
   The Conservation Law Foundation, which consulted with GMP on the
restructuring plan, immediately issued a statement supporting the GMP
proposal, saying it would continue GMP's demand-side management effort at
about its current $4 million/year level.
   CLF said that by supporting a committed stream of stable funding for
conservation and renewables, GMP was taking a position already supported by
New England Electric System in its restructuring model for New England,
issued in October, 1995.
   The PSB proposed in December that utilities in the state submit
restructuring plans by mid-May 1996. It also proposed a series of
roundtable discussions early in the year after which it will issue
recommendations for specific restructuring plans (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 8).
   GMP is the first utility in the state to submit a full plan and clearly
hopes to get an edge in guiding the upcoming discussions and PBS decisions
over the next six months. It said it hoped to work with other groups in the
state to turn the Green Mountain plan into the ``Vermont Plan.''
   While Vermont Gov. Howard Dean (D) had proposed going to retail choice
by the end of 1997, the PSB has not yet proposed a date for actual
restructuring to begin.

GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION TO BE SPLIT WHEN BGE AND PEPCO
COMBINE

   Baltimore Gas & Electric and Potomac Electric Power will split
generation, transmission and distribution into distinct units when the
companies merge, which is expected in 1997 (NPR, 29 Sept '95, 1).
   They said this separation will ``position the company to better serve
specific customer needs and to be prepared for potential changes in the
utility industry as competition increases.'' The gas business will also be
operated separately, and there will be a distinct District of Columbia unit
to focus on the district's ``unique'' regulatory, legislative and community
relations needs.
   The utilities have also announced that the merged company will be called
Constellation Energy Corp. That is now the name used by BGE's independent
power subsidiary, which has 276 MW of equity in 27 operating plants and 10
more projects under development. The utilities did not say how that unit's
name will be affected.
   After the merger, BGE chairman Christian Poindexter will serve as chief
executive officer of Constellation and PEPCO chairman Edward Mitchell will
be chairman of the board. John Derrick, PEPCO's president and chief
operating officer, will fill those same offices with Constellation, while
Edward Crooke, BGE's president and COO, will become vice chairman of
Constellation, overseeing strategic planning and subsidiaries.
   In the separation of electric functions, the following appointments were
made: Robert Denton, senior vice president for generation; Ronald Lowman,
vice president, fossil; Charles Cruse, vice president, nuclear; William
Sim, vice president, generation support; Thomas Brady, group vice
president, distribution; Andrew Williams, group vice president,
transmission; and Sharon Hostetter, vice president for marketing.

HOLYOKE MUNI WANTS TO TAKE OVER DAM FROM NORTHEAST UTILITIES SUBSIDIARY

   The city of Holyoke, Mass., has begun an effort to take control of the
30.8-MW Hadley Falls hydroelectric station on the Connecticut River which
is now owned by Northeast Utilities subsidiary Holyoke Water Power.
   The 50-year federal license for the dam expires in 1999 and Holyoke said
it plans to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to award the new
operating license to municipal utility Holyoke Gas & Electric.
   Under the plan, the Holyoke muni would add 33 MW of new capacity to the
dam and use the power both to lower costs for its own customers by 17% and
attract new power users to the area based on the low-cost supplies.
   At the same time, NU officials said that Holyoke Water Power intends to
apply to FERC to renew its license to operate the dam. Applications must be
filed to FERC by June 30, 1997.
   The city of Holyoke's plan won support from local voters by a 4 to 1
margin in a non-binding referendum in November 1995. During the campaign,
the city claimed the project would provide benefits to the city of between
$160 million and $250 million over the first 25 years through a combination
of lower cost power, job creation and improved property values.
   It also stressed that the benefits of the dam should go to the city
residents, a clear dig at NU, HWP's out-of-state corporate ownership.
   The city has begun a process to get input from public groups and
agencies and prepare a plan for presentation to FERC. It has asked for
comments by Jan. 28.
   In initial discussions, an intervenor committee for the city of South
Hadley, Mass., which is across the river from Holyoke, has said it will
emphasize in its comments the need for the eventual licensee to remain
financially viable during power industry restructuring in Massachusetts.
   South Hadley also said it wants a full exploration of the environmental
issues involved in expanding the capacity of the dam and whether it would
be environmentally preferable to end all power production at the site.
   Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric has assisted the city with
developing plans for financing the takeover and may possibly provide
financial assistance if the project went ahead.

MOODY'S SEES FALLING UTILITY RATINGS RESULTING FROM INDUSTRY DEREGULATION

   Credit ratings of utilities in the Northeast are particularly vulnerable
to electric industry restructuring, according to a new Moody's Investors
Service report.
   Compared to those in neighboring regions, investor-owned, municipal and
state electric utilities in the Northeast ``with above-average costs are
likely to experience a deterioration in credit quality as some investments
are unrecoverable from customers through rates,'' the agency said in a
prepared statement announcing publication of its report, ``Northeast
Break-Even Analysis,'' authored by vice president and senior analyst Julie
Doetsch, and Tim Fremont.
   Contributing to this deterioration are expensive nuclear and fossil fuel
assets and power purchase contracts with independent producers, much of
which may end up as stranded following deregulation, Moody's said. It
estimated that stranded costs in the Northeast total $43 billion, or 145%
of the combined equity of the utilities in the region. This represents a
quarter of all stranded costs of all U.S. investor-owned utilities.
   ``Moody's does not believe that the Northeast utilities can be shielded
from the negative impact of price competition,'' the agency said. It added
that it expects ``that many of these utilities...will be forced to bear
some of the financial pain associated with the transition. This scenario in
turn may result in a diminished equity cushion available to debtholders,
thus pressuring ratings.'' It said the weighted average rating for
utilities in the region is ``Baa1,'' below the industry average of ``A3.''
   In analyzing the Northeast, Moody's examined ``all major rated utilities
within two transmission interconnnects of Consolidated Edison of New
York,'' including 25 investor-owned utilities in Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island and Vermont, plus two public power and two Canadian utilities. The
utilities represent over $153 billion in assets, $29.7 billion in equity
and $48 billion in annual revenues.
   Moody's looked at each utility's cost structure to find what price it
must charge for electric power to ``break even'' and cover its variable and
fixed costs. Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power Authority, relying
primarily on relatively cheap hydropower, fared best cost-wise in this
analysis, while United Illuminating and Long Island Lighting, both at
$105/kW, and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric, at $99/kW, had the
highest break-even costs.
   Moody's also found that power purchase contracts with NUGs affect the
cost structures of two out of three utilities in the region. ``The most
severely impacted are the small northern New England utilities. When
purchased power is included,'' Moody's said, ``the break-even prices for
Central Vermont Public Service, Central Maine Power, and Bangor
Hydro-Electric each increase over 400%.''

CALPINE SEEKS EWG STATUS FOR PLANTS IN N.J. IT WOULD ACQUIRE FROM O'BRIEN

   Calpine Corp. has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
classify two New Jersey projects as exempt wholesale generators. However,
it plans to sell all capacity from the projects to Jersey Central Power &
Light under renegotiated contracts that cut rates, but obligate JCP&L to
pay all gas costs.
   The 122-MW project at DuPont's Parlin facility and the 52-MW Newark
Boxboard plant would be acquired from O'Brien Environmental Energy, which
is under Chapter 11 protection of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Last summer, Philadelphia-based O'Brien agreed to sell all of its assets
to Calpine for $107 million and the assumption of $90 million in debt (NPR,
21 July '95, 13). However, NRG Energy, the affiliate of Northern States
Power, later challenged the sale and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark,
N.J., agreed to hold an auction, where other firms could bid for O'Brien.
The court was scheduled to begin hearings on Jan. 3 to consider the offers.
Calpine general counsel Joseph Ronan said he is optimistic, since O'Brien
had rejected an NRG offer before the original takeover deal was struck.
   Although EWG status allows power producers to operate ``merchant''
plants, selling to various buyers, that is not Calpine's intention,
according to Ronan. He said the San Jose, Calif., firm plans to sell all
electric output from the plants to the current buyer, JCP&L. However, it
wants to avoid disputes over qualifying facility status under the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA).
   That law requires certain efficiency standards for both electric and
thermal output, and JCP&L challenged the QF status of both O'Brien plants
after prolonged outages due to a fire in Newark and technical problems at
Parlin. If a project loses its QF status, the utility can revoke contract
terms and pay only its avoided cost--as Rochester Gas & Electric recently
sought to do to a Kamine/Besicorp project, before a federal court granted a
temporary QF waiver (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 11). Calpine had already faced the
problem when its Watsonville, Calif., plant lost its steam host, Ronan
noted.
   Before applying for EWG status for the New Jersey plants, Calpine
renegotiated the power sales contracts with JCP&L, Ronan said. The new
terms provide JCP&L with more dispatching at Parlin and rate changes at
both facilities. Under the new Parlin contract, only 41 MW of the 122-MW
plant will be considered ``base capacity (though that can rise as high as
50 MW under certain conditions), while the balance is divided into several
levels of dispatch capacity.
   For the Parlin base load, JCP&L will make capacity payments of 5.97
cents/kWh during the on-peak period, and no payments off-peak. For the
dispatchable capacity, the utility will make fixed capital payments of
$9.90/kW/month through 2003, and $6.40 afterwards, though Calpine may elect
to levelize all payments at $9.02. In addition, JCP&L will pay $3.50 in
1995 for operations and maintenance, adjusted annually.
   At the Newark plant, JCP&L will pay a base rate of 4.325 cents/kWh,
adjusted according to various indices. In the original O'Brien contract,
JCP&L was paying 6.17 cents.
   In both cases, JCP&L would pay for all costs of natural gas, supplying
the projects from the gas pool that parent company General Public Utilities
has set up (NPR, 15 Sept '95, 14). Although it started that pool to cut
costs for its own peakers, GPU said it would also allow non-utility
generators to participate if they agreed to renegotiate contracts.

JCP&L SEEKS $18-MILLION RATE RECOVERY FOR BUYOUT OF CROWN/VISTA CONTRACTS

   Jersey Central Power & Light has asked the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities to let it collect $18 million in rates to cover the buyout of two
100-MW contracts with an independent power producer.
   JCP&L reached a settlement with the developers of the Crown/Vista coal
project after a long dispute that wound through the BPU, state courts and
the state legislature (NPR, 15 Sept '95, 9). The 362-MW coal project was
originally proposed by Mission Energy and Fluor Daniel in 1989, but Fluor
Daniel later sold its stake to Ahlstrom Development and Entergy Power
Development. When the partners concluded they could not bring the twin coal
plants on-line by the 1997 ``sunset dates,'' they were granted an extension
by the BPU.
   The utility--which chose 200 MW of the project in a 1989
solicitation--said it no longer needed the capacity and successfully
challenged the extension in state court (NPR, 26 May '95, 6). The
developers then got the backing of some state lawmakers to force the
extension, but the buyout was announced before their bill cleared the
legislature.
   To terminate the contracts, JCP&L agreed to pay $17 million, but it is
asking to collect $18 million in rates, to cover all of its costs. That
would be recovered in blocks of $6-million over each of the next three
years. The utility defended the request, saying purchases from the
Crown/Vista project would have cost $700 million above market prices over
the lives of the contracts.
   JCP&L is looking to collect the funds through the Levelized Energy
Adjustment Clause (LEAC), which passes along energy costs and other
expenses without profit. In its $37.7 million request, the utility is also
looking to recover $19 million in demand-side management costs.
   Metropolitan Edison, another unit of General Public Utilities, also
terminated its 100-MW contract with the Crown/Vista developers, and has
asked the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for rate recovery. That
buyout cost $30 million because of the different timing of the contracts
and the costs incurred by the developers.

N.Y. PSC CONSIDERS RECOMMENDATION TO REVISE AVOIDED-COST CALCULATIONS

   An administrative law judge in New York's Public Service Department is
recommending new long-run avoided cost calculation methods that would more
accurately reflect industry costs. Adoption by the Public Service
Commission of the new method could result in an increase in the costs
incurred by utilities and ratepayers in doing business with independent
power producers, according to the recommendation.
   The recommendation, issued Dec. 19 by administrative law judge Rafael
Epstein, is part of another recommendation to establish a process for
setting fuel targets and buyback rates. Both cases (93-E-0912; 93-E-1075)
were combined in January 1995. Briefs opposing the recommendations are due
Jan. 8, 1996; final briefs are due Jan. 25.
   The recommendation to revise calculation methodology endorses in
principle independent power producer Sithe Energies' proposal to adopt the
`firm method' for estimating avoided energy costs, not the `non-firm
method' now employed by the PSC and favored by the utilities and staff.
Epstein recommends exploring the firm method's application before using
it.
   The recommendation calls for a generic annual proceeding based on a
unified data base, a conclusion supported by staff and Sithe, but opposed
by the utilities. As it is now, fuel targets and buyback rates are
determined in utility-specific rate proceedings. Epstein recommends that
the commission should narrowly limit the permissible scope of
company-specific adjustments prompted by individual utility's objections
provided in the computer model's data base produced in the generic case.
   Epstein also recommends that the commission adopt four previous rulings
as the basis for determining which computer model inputs should be deemed
trade secrets. He urged that data ought to be considered a trade secret
only if the information is competitively useful and would not be readily
ascertainable by competitors in an unregulated market.

NEES CANNOT CHARGE FIRM TRANSMISSION RATE FOR PART NON-FIRM SERVICE: FERC

   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has told New England Electric
System that it cannot charge a full firm transmission rate for service to a
group of Massachusetts municipals unless it actually provides them with
firm service.
   In a Dec. 29 order, FERC said that NEES could not charge the firm
service rate to carry 35.4 MW of preference power to the munis from the New
York Power Authority since it was providing firm service for only 17.7 MW
of the load (Doc. No. ER96-200-000).
   It approved for filing a firm service charge for the 17.7 MW and
required NEES to file within 30 days a new, lower cost rate for the
less-than-firm service it was offering for the rest of the load.
   NEES originally filed the transmission rate proposal on Oct. 31, 1995,
saying that it was the result of negotiations with Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric.
   According to NEES, it was not obliged to offer any firm service to the
municipals and as part of the negotiations it had voluntarily agreed to
provide the 17.7 MW of firm capacity at MMWEC's request. In return, MMWEC
agreed to pay the firm rate for the entire 35.4-MW load.
   The group was under pressure to secure the capacity to bring in the
low-cost power from NYPA's Niagara Falls and St. Lawrence projects.
However, the town of Norwood questioned the arrangement and said that in
the past FERC had always required NEES to provide lower rates to the group
for non-firm service.
   In its order, FERC agreed with this argument, saying that the mere fact
MMWEC agreed to pay the high rate did not make it legally acceptable. Also,
the fact that NEES was voluntarily offering 17.7 MW of firm service as part
of the deal ``was not a sufficient justification for charging a firm rate
for transmission that is less than firm,'' FERC said.
   According to FERC, NEES could collect the full rate for the firm
service, but it had no right to charge ``excessive'' rates for the non-firm
service.
   FERC also granted a waiver of the normal 60-day notice period to allow
the rate to take effect at once. The parties had originally aimed at
beginning service by Nov. 1, 1995.
   Currently, the NEES firm transmission tariff is about $16/kW/year. The
FERC order said that NEES did not have to offer the municipals its standard
non-firm rate but instead could propose a rate reflecting the fact that the
non-firm service agreed to in the negotiations with MMWEC would provide
some advantages over normal non-firm service.

HOULTON, ME., WATER CO. GAINS NEPOOL MEMBERSHIP; BUYS FROM BOUGHT-OUT NUG

   The New England Power Pool has agreed to allow the Houlton Water Co. in
Houlton, Me., to become a member, although it is not located within the
NEPOOL control area.
   The publicly owned utility in northern Maine is connected to the rest of
New England through New Brunswick Power and was asked to make specific
promises to NEPOOL on meeting capacity responsibility requirements in order
to join the group.
   In 1994, Houlton decided to drop wholesale purchases from Maine Public
Service, which is located in the same area. Instead, it decided to take
12.5 MW of supplies from a biomass power plant in Fort Fairfield, Me.,
taken over by Central Maine Power through an earlier buyout deal.
   Houlton switched to the CMP supplies effective Jan. 1, 1996, and under a
proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Dec. 11,
1995, it will become a NEPOOL member Feb. 1.
   NEPOOL said in its FERC filing that because of the link through Canada,
Houlton would require scheduling arrangements inside the NEPOOL dispatching
system different than those used by other members. These were being worked
out with Houlton.
   Also, NEPOOL said, Houlton would not have to include in its adjusted
load 3.4 MW from the Maine Yankee plant which is backed up by New Brunswick
Power resources.
   Separately, Houlton and MPS are continuing a dispute before FERC over
the level of transmission costs MPS will be able to charge Houlton for use
of its system to wheel power from the Fort Fairfield plant (Doc. No.
ER95-836-000).
   MPS proposed a general transmission tariff in April, 1995, based on a
levelized rate calculation system which would result in a $35/kW/year
charge (NPR, 14 April '95, 5).
   Houlton claims this rate is exorbitant and called it a ``back door
attempt'' by MPS to cover stranded investment costs.
   With the case still before the judge, no FERC decision on the
transmission rate is likely for several months. Under the current
arrangement, Houlton begins accepting service from MPS on Jan. 1 at the
proposed MPS rate. But it will be entitled to a rebate if FERC later
decides to lower that rate.
   In its arguments to FERC, MPS stressed that its proposal was based on
new FERC guidelines for transmission ratemaking. Also, it said that former
wholesale customers such as Houlton were not entitled to special low rates
from MPS and should pay the same generic rate offered to other customers.
   Houlton argued that because MPS' transmission plant is old and heavily
depreciated the levelized system did not apply. But MPS said that it
planned major new improvements to its transmission system and a levelized
approach was appropriate.

MAINE YANKEE OUTPUT TO BE LIMITED TO 90% DUE TO COOLING PUMP CONCERNS

   The Maine Yankee nuclear plant will only be allowed to operate at 90% of
full capacity, or 820 MW, when it returns to service early in 1996 after a
12-month outage to repair cracked tubes in the plant's steam generator.
   The derating is being imposed on the plant by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission based on claims by an anonymous whistleblower that the plant's
emergency core cooling pumps could not handle the reactor if it was
operating at full power.
   The claims, received by the NRC in early December, said that plant
operators knew about the problem in the late 1980s but nevertheless asked
NRC to upgrade the plant capacity to 910 MW. The derating will effectively
put the plant back to its original rating.
   The derating will be in effect until the NRC does a thorough review of
the situation, including the computer modeling techniques used to determine
proper safety levels. It is not clear how long the review will take.
   In the meantime, Maine Yankee officials were awaiting a memo from the
NRC detailing the exact operating conditions for the plant. Once they
receive it they expect to restart the reactor immediately.
   Maine Yankee has just completed a major project to sleeve the tubes in
its two steam generators to prevent cracking (NPR, 26 May '95, 10). The
project cost plant owners, including Central Maine Power, Northeast
Utilities and New England Electric System, $30 million in repair costs and
$60 million in replacement power costs.
   The loss of the 90 MW of capacity due to the derating will create a new
financial burden although plant officials could not predict the cost at
this time. A spokesman for CMP said that the actual cost will depend on
whether the winter is colder than usual and more peaking power is needed
and also on the availability of extra hydro capacity in the region based on
higher than usual water levels.
   The claims about the coolant system have no connection to the steam
generator repairs which plant officials said went well and came in only a
few days late and under budget.
   Maine Yankee president Charles Frizzle said that with the sleeving done
there was no reason to think that the plant would not be able to function
normally for the rest of its license period, which ends in 2008.
   Anti-nuclear groups have questioned this. Also, Standard & Poor's has
raised concerns about Maine Yankee's ability to maintain plant performance
over the long term, issuing a downgrade of Maine Yankee's corporate credit
rating in December.

1,100-MW SALEM NUCLEAR UNITS TO RETURN TO SERVICE IN SECOND AND THIRD
QUARTERS

   Public Service Electric & Gas expects to bring the Salem nuclear units
back into service in the second and third quarters of 1996. Each unit
generates 1,100 MW for a consortium of utilities that includes PSE&G (43%
ownership), PECO Energy (43%), Atlantic Electric (7%) and Delmarva Power
(7%).
   The plants were shut down in May and June for unrelated problems with
heat removal equipment and switch gear cooling fans (NPR, 23 June '95, 7).
Although these were not major flaws, station operator PSE&G came to an
agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to keep the plants down
for extended outages in order to thoroughly inspect the problems and take
preventive steps (NPR, 4 Aug '95, 10).
   The Salem station has been plagued by recurring shutdowns, and the
restart plans call for improving human performance, operations,
maintenance, equipment reliability and other areas.
   PSE&G originally expected Unit 1 to be operating by the first quarter of
1996 and Unit 2 by the second quarter, but those schedules have now been
pushed back. The utility has been purchasing power in the wholesale market
to make up the shortfall, while PECO already has excess generating
capacity.

PSE&G OPENS 150-MW CAPACITY BLOCK IN ITS DSM `STANDARD OFFER' PROGRAM

   Public Service Electric & Gas will be seeking 150 MW of capacity from
energy efficiency projects over the next two years.
   That block was set by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in a
recent ruling on the utility's demand-side management program for 1996-97
(Docket No. EE95090415). PSE&G had originally requested a one-year, 75-MW
standard offer, but DSM advocates pushed to expand the plan and the BPU
agreed.
   Under the standard offer program, PSE&G makes blocks of capacity
available and pays its avoided cost to energy efficiency projects. Since
1993, the utility has been accepting bids for a 150-MW block, and in the
recent case the BPU expanded that Standard Offer No. 1 to 185 MW for
proposals submitted by Jan. 2, 1996.
   The new 150-MW solicitation is designated Standard Offer No. 2, and will
be broken into three 50-MW blocks. These will provide declining payments,
since additional capacity will reduce the value of savings to the company,
and thereby, its avoided cost. That figure now stands at $5.45/kW/month for
capacity and about 2.6 cents/kWh for energy. However, the first 50-MW block
of the new standard offer will set prices 27% lower, while the second block
will be priced 33% below Standard Offer No. 1 and the third block will be
set 38% below it.
   The BPU made allowance for a fourth block with no defined size at prices
that would be 44% lower than Standard Offer No. 1. There will also be a
15-MW residential ``carve-out,'' with at least half of that reserved for
low-income residences. For those projects, prices will be set 14% higher
than Standard Offer No. 1 for the first half of the contract period and 33%
lower for the second half.
   In addition, PSE&G will accept up to 10 MW of fuel-switching projects,
but only at government-owned facilities. It will also accept up to 1 MW of
projects that displace electric air conditioning in summer with chillers
powered by waste heat from cogeneration plants. These must involve existing
cogeneration facilities that exceed 50% efficiency, and they must not
result in incremental fuel use or emissions.
   If New Jersey opens up retail competition, PSE&G will continue to make
standard offer payments to projects whose hosts choose an electric supplier
other than the utility. However, that pledge would only apply if PSE&G is
still allowed to recover its standard offer payments through some type of
system benefits charge. DSM proponents in many states are lobbying for such
charges on distribution services to maintain efficiency programs in the
face of retail access.
   PSE&G accepts standard offer projects on a first-come, first-served
basis, though they must be qualified by PSE&G for technical merit and
savings potential. They may be installed by users themselves or by energy
service companies. One ESCO that is active in the program is PSE&G's own
subsidiary, Public Service Conservation Resources Corp. (PSCRC), which
works with customers on standard offer projects and provides financing.

MONITOR: CON ED IS SLOW ON CLEAN-UP, AND CRACKS DOWN ON WHISTLE BLOWERS

   A court-appointed environmental monitor has found that Consolidated
Edison's environmental programs still have significant shortcomings and
that the utility has discouraged proper reporting of environmental
mishaps.
   ``In at least one instance,'' the monitor states in his first report
since being named last spring, ``there has been direct retaliation against
an employee who reported information to me.''
   Appointment of the monitor, Mitchell Bernard, came as part of the
sentence handed down after Con Ed pleaded guilty to having conspired to
cover up the release of asbestos in a 1989 steam pipe explosion. The
utility was also fined $2 million. U.S. District Court Judge John Martin,
who sentenced Con Ed, received the monitor's report Dec. 18.
   The monitor writes that Con Ed generally cooperated with his
investigations, as required by the court. But he cites some notable
exceptions: a few employees were ``less than open'' in answering questions;
and Con Ed ``failed to comply'' with the court's direction that it not
penalize an employee in any way for providing information to the monitor.
   Con Ed ``has taken a number of commendable steps to promote
environmental compliance,'' the monitor notes. He recognizes the creation
of an internal mechanism for investigating reports of environmental
misconduct and the hiring of a new vice president for environmental
affairs, among other actions.
   ``At this point, however, Con Edison is without many of the basic
elements of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of
environmental laws,'' the monitor concludes. Key problems include:
ineffectiveness in the company's new Compliance Administrators Program;
indications of ``an ongoing destructive corporate culture''; and problems
handling asbestos.
   ``We take this report very seriously,'' said a Con Ed spokesman. The
report ``acknowledges that we have improved our environmental awareness but
that we have a lot more to do,'' he added.
   Episodes of improper treatment of employees who reported possible
environmental hazards, brought to the company's attention by the monitor's
report, have resulted in a number of specific disciplinary actions. Con Ed
explained, in a response that was also filed with the court, that two
supervisors have been suspended without pay, and that other individuals
have been disciplined.
   ``These were isolated instances,'' the spokesman said. However, any
similar incidents in the future in which an employee is punished or
intimidated will result in dismissal of the supervisor. ``We will not
tolerate intimidation of employees who bring forward environmental
complaints.'' The spokesman acknowledged that ``we have to educate our
employees about our company's environmental policies.''
   The most serious of the incidents of intimidation involved spilled oil
and water that leaked down a drain at a Con Ed service center and a problem
in the company's asbestos abatement program.
   Overall, the monitor writes that he ``uncovered significant problems.''
The most common, he concludes, were related to the cleanup of
polychlorinated biphenyls and to asbestos abatement projects.
