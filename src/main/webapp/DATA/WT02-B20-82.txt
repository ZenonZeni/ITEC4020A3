Fragile X Syndrome, a common inherited disorder involving a fragile site on
the x-chromosome, results in significant speech and language problems and
diminished cognitive/intellectual functioning.  Improved accuracy of diagnosis
and the strong heritability component means that schools increasingly will be
faced with the issues involved in educating students who have the syndrome.  (

The cytogenetic survey of 67 individuals previously identified as having
mental retardation and autistic behaviors revealed only 1.5 percent with the
fragile X chromosome.  The finding suggests that most persons with fragile X
syndrome do not have autistic behaviors severe enough to be identified as a
secondary psychiatric diagnosis.  (Author/DB)<BR>

Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of mental retardation next to
Down syndrome.  The syndrome is more prevalent in males because they only have
one X chromosome, where the gene for fragile X is carried, while women have two
X chromosomes and the normal gene can compensate for the affected chromosome.
Certain physical features are associated with the syndrome, such as elongated
faces and hyperextensible finger joints.  Children with fragile X have IQs that
decline as they become adults.  Language problems affect all males with fragile
X, even those that have a normal IQ.  Many prepubertal males may have
borderline IQs, learning disabilities, attention deficits, and hyperactivity.
Primary weaknesses include arithmetic, short-term memory, and signs of autistic
behavior that lasts into adulthood.  Women with fragile X show milder symptoms
than men, both in physical and cognitive problems.  One of the main treatments
for fragile X is folic acid, along with special education, language therapy,
occupational therapy, and psychotherapy.  Genetic counseling is very important
for anyone who is aware of having or being a carrier of the fragile X syndrome.

<B>KABUKI MAKE-UP SYNDROME</B><P>

The name describes the prominent facial characteristics of children with this
disorder. The following are excerpts from the info in the NORD database
regarding Kabuki Make-up Syndrome.<P>

Symptoms<BR>
One of the most distinguishing features of Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome is the
unusual facial features.  The opening between the upper and lower eyelids is
abnormally long and one third of the lower eyelid is turned outward.   The tip
of the nose may be broad and depressed and the ears may be large and malformed.
The eyebrows of patients with Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome may be high and arched.
The palate of the mouth may be cleft or have a  high arch, and the upper and
lower teeth may not meet properly (malocclusion).<P>

These unusual facial features resemble the make-up of actors in a Japanese
traditional play called "Kabuki". Many patients with Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome
have a sideways curvature of the spine, a short fifth finger that curves inward,
and abnormalities of the vertebrae, hands and hip joint. All patients with
Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome have mental retardation ranging from mild to severe.
Short stature and abnormal skin ridge  patterns on the fingers, toes, palms of
the hands and soles of the feet are common. Early development of breasts in
females and heart defects have been found in a few patients with Kabuki Make-Up
Syndrome.<P>

Causes<BR>
The majority of cases of Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome are thought to occur for no
apparent reason (sporadic).  Three patients recorded in the medical literature
had abnormalities on the Y chromosome leading researchers to believe it may be
inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.<P>

Affected Populations<BR>
Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females
in equal numbers.  There have been 70 cases reported in the medical literature.
The majority of cases have occurred in people of Japanese ancestry. Cases of
Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome have also been reported in Canada, Italy, Latin America,
Germany, Libya, and the United States.<P>

Therapies:   Standard<BR>
Patients with Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome may benefit from orthopedic care for
prevention of scoliosis.  Physical therapy and cosmetic surgery may also be
helpful. Physical therapy may benefit in the prevention of scoliosis. Genetic
counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families.<P>

This special edition explores the serious genetic disorder, Lesch-Nyhan
Disease (LND), which is characterized by severe dystonia, spasticity, speech
impairment, renal disease, varying degrees of cognitive deficit, and,
especially, compulsive self-injury.  The information provided is based on
experience at the Matheny School and Hospital (New Jersey) and reflects that
institution's philosophy of individualized treatment and development of skills
necessary to self-direct one's life, regardless of the degree of disability.  In
the first section, an overview of LND is provided in tandem with a column of
observations and comments by staff at the school about a specific case.  Later
sections focus on self-injurious behavior, health care, adapted equipment,
speech/communication/feeding, education, and leisure/recreation.  (Contains 11

with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, typically characterized by apasticity, mental
retardation, and violent biting of the lips and fingers.  Utilizing an
electromyographic (EMG) monitor and a custom-designed relay connected to either
a computer game or a tape player, a 15-year-old male learned to control sudden
high levels of arousal-related muscular tension which were the antecedents of
self-abuse.  A subsequent study of the experimental treatment protocol (rather
than the viability of the instrumentation) is proposed.  (Author/JW)<BR>

A case study focuses on the characteristics and physical management of a 15-
year-old with Prader-Willi Syndrome, a birth defect associated with hypotonia,
insatiable appetite, hypogonadism, central nervous system dysfunction, and
abnormal growth and development .  A literature review addresses studies
dealing with behavior modification of obesity and continuous eating, nutrition
counseling, and physical activity intervention.  Interventions in the case
study included those programmed by trained personnel in the following service
areas: adapted physical education, behavior modification, nutrition, nursing,
dormitory living, social work, education, and speech and language.  Data are
reported for behavior, weight, and adjustment to physical activity.  Analysis
of data from the S's developmental and medical histories, continuous
evaluations, previous staffing summaries, motor proficiency tests, exercise
metabolism tests, progress reports and staff and parent survey forms revealed
that the S made considerable progress in reaching her program goals.  She was
found to demonstrate most of the characteristics classic to the Prader-Willi
population.  Recommendations were made for programming.  (CL)<BR>

<B>WILLIAMS SYNDROME</B><P>

 Williams Syndrome is a very rare condition which statistics state
 affect approximately 1 in 20, 000 babies. It is an inborn error of
 metabolism cause as yet unknown, which can leave a degree of brain,
 heart and kidney damage, ranging from mild to severe.
 The symptoms, characteristics and behaviors of Williams Syndrome are
 as follows:<BR>
 <UL><li>Elfin/Pixie Facial Features : a broad forehead, upturned nose,
 wide mouth, full lips, widely spaced teeth, small chin, puffiness
 around the eyes, small head, depressed nasal bridge.<BR>
 <li>Stellate Eye Pattern: blue and green-eyed children may have a
 star-like pattern in the iris. Brown-eyed children don't usually
 display this pattern.<BR>
 <li>Low Birth Weight: many of these children are labeled failure to
 thrive but do show a slow but steady growth and weight gains. Vomiting,
 gagging, diarrhea or constipation are common in infancy.<BR>
 <li>Heart Disorders: can range from non-existent, to slow murmurs, to
 aorticor pulmonary stenoses (narrowing).<BR>
 <li>Elevated Serum Calcium Level: this sometimes occurs in the first
 two years of infancy.<BR>
 <li>Hernias: umbilical, inguinal<BR>
 <li>Apparent Sensitive Hearing: can overreact to volume or type of
 noise (high-pitched motors, machines).<BR>
 <li>Development Delays: sitting, walking, language, gross and fine
 motor skills.<BR>
 <li>Friendly/Talkative Personality: unafraid of strangers, have
 some attention problems, sometimes described as impulsive.<BR>
 <li>Possible mild mental retardation: attention deficit-type behaviors,
 good long-term memory.<BR>
 <li>Premature puberty</ul><P>

Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder first described by Dr. J.C.P. Williams
of New Zealand.  Ws is considered rare and is thought to occur in about 1:20,000
births.  Research has indicated that individuals with Williams Syndrome are
missing an elastin gene on chromosome #7.  This deletion could account for many
of the features of Williams Syndrome, although there may be other genetic
material missing from the same region.  The extent of additional deletions may
vary and be responsible for some of the medical and developmental difficulties
experienced by the affected individual.<P>

This paper summarizes the case histories of four young children with
concurrent autistic disorder and Williams syndrome.  Williams syndrome
comprises a peculiar facial appearance, learning disorder, and often
hypercalcemia, mild microcephaly, large blood vessel stenosis, and a specific
behavioral phenotype.  Literature on Williams syndrome is reviewed, focusing on
prevalence, biochemical abnormalities, chromosome abnormalities, and brain
morphology.  (JDD)<BR>
