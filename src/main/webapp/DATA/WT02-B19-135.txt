<p>
This area is served by the following research laboratories: Computer Integrated Manufacturing (Professor B. Benhabib), 
Engineering Mechanics and Design (Prof. S.A. Meguid), Non-Linear Systems Control (Prof. J.K. Mills), Advanced 
Manufacturing Technologies and Processes (Prof. C.B. Park), and Creative Design Research Unit (Prof. R.D. Venter).<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/benhab.html"> <b> Professor B. Benhabib </b></a>
<br>
Development of information-management systems for 
CAD geometric data.  Development of feature-based 
design systems.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/cleghorn.html"> <b> Professor W.L. Cleghorn </b></a>
<br>
Computer Aided Analysis and Design of Mechanical 
Systems: Optimum forces in a robot gripper, employing 
game theory; Design of a Geneva mechanism with curved 
slots; Kinematic analysis of positive displacement pumps.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/fox.html"> <b> Professor M.S. Fox </b></a>
<br>
Concurrent engineering; Collaboration; Case-based reasoning; 
Engineering-knowledge representation; World-wide-web 
interfaces; Engineering management.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/goldenberg.html"> <b> Professor A.A. Goldenberg </b></a>
<br>
Off-line simulation and programming of robotic based 
automation:  Systems, devices, work cells and special 
grippers.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/meguid.html"> <b> Professor S.A. Meguid </b></a>
<br>
Integration of computer modeling, computer-aided 
analysis, and computer-aided manufacturing in the 
design process through application to real engineering 
problems, such as landing gear assemblies and shot-
peening equipment. Development of methods for 
treating material and geometrical non-linearities: Contact 
algorithms using the variational inequalities method.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/mills.html"> <b> Professor J.K. Mills </b></a>
<br>
Design of control systems lies within the realm of 
computer aided engineering. Control system design 
problems are posed as convex optimization problems 
which are amenable to sophisticated optimization 
methods. Application areas include robot control, 
manufacturing process control.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/neumann.html"> <b> Professor A.W. Neumann </b></a>
<br>
Development of computer software to support 
experimental methodologies in surface research. <p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/park.html"> <b> Professor C.B. Park </b></a>
<br>
Development of laminated rapid prototyping and 
manufacturing systems using CAD data.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/shu.html"> <b> Professor L. Shu </b></a>
<br>
Integrating environmental considerations with traditional 
design requirements: Computer implementation of 
traditional engineering tools for predicting life-cycle 
environmental performance of products (e.g., reliability 
modeling to predict system failure and part replacement, 
which directly determines resource consumption and 
waste generation). Development of life-cycle frameworks 
that consider  specific aspects of product design, such as 
material choice or joint design. Such frameworks may 
also result in building design-for-environment knowledge 
that can be generalized and applied to other aspects of 
product design.<p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/venter.html"> <b> Professor R.D. Venter </b></a>
<br>
Design Theory and Methodologies. Axiomatic 
considerations in the formalization of the design 
approach. Concurrent engineering. Application of 
computer aided engineering software tools to the design, 
analysis and simulation of all manufacturing processes 
and products. Particular emphasis is given to the tool, die 
and mold (TDM) industrial sector (injection molding, NC 
machining). <p>


<a href="../../staff/profiles/vicente.html"> <b> Professor K.J. Vicente </b></a>
<br>
Understanding and enhancing the rate of human factors 
engineering in systems design. Evaluation of alternative 
information sources for guidance in design. Field 
observations of multi-disciplinary design in industry. <p>

<a href="../../staff/profiles/zu.html"> <b> Professor J.W. Zu </b></a>
