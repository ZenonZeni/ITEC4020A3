<h4 >Update:  Campaign to End Discrimination</h4>
<BR>
<h4 ><font color="#000080"><b> It can't be done without you</b></font></h4>
<P>
<I>by Rona Purdy, campaign chair, and Mike Malloy, campaign projects director </I>
<P>
	The opportunity to effect change in the acceptance of brain 
disorders as physical illnesses has never been better.  Although we 
did not get passage of the Domenici-Wellstone amendment in the 
final version of the Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Care Reform Act, we 
did move the "needle" considerably in the minds of decision-makers. 
<P>
 The issue became one of blatant discrimination.  Policy makers can 
no longer continue to ignore us in the private healthcare system 
and treat us as second-class citizens in the public Medicaid system 
without risking being labeled discriminators.
<P>
Make brain disorders as acceptable as heart disease, cancer, and 
epilepsy.
<P>
	In the year ahead, there is opportunity to move our agenda in 
both private and public health care.  You MUST play a key role.
<P>
	NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination plan for year two will 
require major efforts in the grassroots.  The opportunity to change 
the way brain disorders are discriminated against in both public 
and private health care will continue to be the major focus of the 
campaign.  Many states will introduce state parity bills.  We will 
all be paying close attention to the Medicaid changes during the 
November election. 
	<P>
To end discrimination we must work together to create a groundswell 
of public support for our issues.  We will not be truly successful 
until the public views severe brain disorders with the same 
compassion and knowledge as it views heart disease, cancer, 
epilepsy, and other physical disorders.  
<P>
	The building of an army to end discrimination requires people. 
 Every attempt must be made to enlist more supporters.  The number 
of people we say we represent matters.  Our current membership 
number is not yet large enough if we are to truly have an impact.
<P>
Here are four things <B>YOU</B> can do now to increase our numbers:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Sign up your entire family in NAMI and your state organization. 
 Sign up your adult children, your brothers, sisters, grandparents, 
aunts, and uncles.  This is the easy part.  Our issue is a family 
issue.  Ending the stigma begins at home.
<P>


<LI> Next, sign up your friends and neighbors.  And ask your family 
members--the ones you just signed up--to do the same thing.  None 
of these people must have a brain disorder in their family--or must 
want to attend a support group--to join us.  All anyone has to do 
is be is a supporter of our mission.  These people probably already 
know that you or someone you love has a brain disorder.  By 
approaching them you are reinforcing your level of comfort with 
discussing brain disorders.  You are teaching them to look beyond 
the stigma and to accept and support brain disorders in the same 
way they would support heart disease, cancer, or Alzheimer's 
disease.  
	<P>
Many state organizations have dues for this type of membership.  We 
recommend that $25 be sent to NAMI, then NAMI will return $7 and 
the new member's name to the state organization. 
<P>


<LI> Then turn to your doctor, dentist, lawyer, accountant, and 
associates at work.  All of these people probably know that someone 
you love has a brain disorder.  Sign them up as members of your 
state organization and NAMI.
<P>


<LI> Reach out to the influential people in your community.  There 
are individuals and organizations in every community that care 
about people.  These are the community activists, religious-
community members and organizations, and members of local civic 
groups.  These people shape community opinions and attitudes--and 
too few understand brain disorders.  Campaign brochures and 
materials are available to you through your state campaign 
coordinator.  But "leafleting the world" at health fairs will have 
minimal impact on discrimination.  On the other hand, distributing 
campaign materials and discussing brain disorders one-to-one with 
your community's opinion leaders will make a difference.  
Presenting the science message as a program at one of their 
meetings is a good way to engage these groups--but sign them up as 
members.
</OL>
<P>
Here are three things <B>YOU</B> can do now to educate your community's 
opinion leaders:
<P>
<OL>
	<LI> Become part of the campaign in your state and community.  All 50 
states--and many communities--have appointed campaign coordinators. 
 Call your state office to get in touch with your coordinator.
<P>

	<LI> Work with your campaign coordinators to reach influential 
opinion leaders in your community.  Ask to speak at their meetings. 
 Use the campaign materials to present the reasons our brain 
disorders should be covered the same way as other brain disorders 
such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or epilepsy.  A key message to 
deliver is that society pays and will continue to pay for these 
disorders one way or another, either by their taxes in Medicaid and 
Medicare payments or by giving us equal protection in private 
insurance.  Take along an open letter to your U.S. senators and 
representatives, your state senator and representatives, your 
governor, and the president.  Ask community leaders to sign them 
and include their affiliation.  Ask them to join us in our efforts 
to end this unfair discrimination--and to join as an associate 
member of NAMI and your state organization.  Signed letters with 
lots of signatures should then be copied and sent to all of the 
parties addressed and to NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination.
<P>

	<LI>  Adopt a legislator.  Target a key legislator for whom you voted 
and take on the ongoing job of making him or her a "friend and 
ally."   Join NAMI for this legislator, as a gift for him or her.  
Send this "friend and ally" frequent notes and information.
<P>

	<LI> Identify business leaders in your community.  Our loudest 
opponent in our efforts to end insurance discrimination for brain 
disorders has been the business community.  Business interests 
widely criticized our attempts to end insurance discrimination as 
being a broad mandate that would lead to skyrocketing costs.  The 
truth of the matter is that coverage of the severe brain disorders 
is not a broad mental health mandate and that numerous studies have 
shown that the cost of ending discrimination is minimal.  By 
identifying local business leaders now, you will be prepared to 
effectively use campaign materials with business groups.  These 
materials will be distributed to state campaign coordinators and 
state organizations in the coming months.
<P>


</OL>
Tell us what you've accomplished and receive a campaign lapel pin.
<P>
	When you've signed up your family, friends, neighbors, co-
workers, senators, representatives, and business acquaintances, 
write to us at the campaign and tell us what you have done.  When 
you have contacted your state and local campaign coordinator and 
worked to reach community opinion leaders, write to us.  Again, 
tell us what you have done.  We will send you a limited-edition 
campaign lapel pin.  Most important, though, you will have joined 
the Campaign to End Discrimination as a participant.
