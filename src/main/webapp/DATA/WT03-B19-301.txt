<P>
The CRC for New Technologies for Power Generation from Low-Rank Coal was established in 1993 as a joint venture to conduct research into aspects of the new power-generation technologies. These are being developed worldwide, to meet the challenges facing the use of low-rank coal. The new technologies are the key to reducing the cost of electricity and emissions to the environment.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre's research program is focused on supporting technologies appropriate for low-rank coals. Research areas include:
<UL>
<LI>Process-simulation studies for power-generation processes.
<LI>Handling and beneficiation of coal.
<LI>Kinetics of coal, beneficiated coal products, and inorganics during combustion and gasification.
<LI>Fluid bed studies for the applications of drying, combustion and gasification.
<LI>Computational fluid dynamic studies, particularly for processes in fluid beds.
<LI>Detection and removal of vaporised sodium from hot gas.
<LI>Clean-up of waste water resulting from coal-beneficiation processes.
<LI>Combustion of low-specific-energy gas derived from coal gasification.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Although the CRC has been in operation for only two years, there has been considerable interest from several major overseas organisations in the modelling of two-phase flows in fluid beds using computational fluid dynamic codes. Proposals have and are being developed to enable the CRC to collaborate with these companies on specific projects.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
One-third of the electricity generated from coal in Australia is from low-rank coal, mostly in Victoria and South Australia. The high moisture content of these coal leads to low energy efficiency, high carbon dioxide emissions and high capital costs when used in conventional pulverised fuel power plants.
Future power stations fuelled with low-rank coal will need to utilise the technologies under development for economic and environmental reasons.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The major Australian resource of low-rank coal is located in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. The former State Electricity Commission of Victoria, which had a major investment in the research, development and utilisation of the coal resource, strongly supported the establishment of the CRC.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
Australia does not have an adequate supply of graduates and postgraduates suitably trained in the science and engineering of power generation. One CRC objective is to provide specialist advanced education and training in low-rank coal utilisation.
Four training areas have been identified: postgraduate research, undergraduate teaching and research, continuing education, and technical and further education. Achievements to date are the awarding of 20 postgraduate scholarships and support for undergraduate courses via specialist lectures, research and design projects, vacation projects and development of experimental demonstration equipment.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
Over the next few years, the CRC expects to contract out to local industry the design and construction of research and pilot plants worth some millions of dollars.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The centre has total funding of $32.3 million contributed by the participants and the Australian Government. The Commonwealth and Victorian generating companies account for $20 million of this budget.
