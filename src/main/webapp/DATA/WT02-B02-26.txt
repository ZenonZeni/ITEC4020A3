<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse</h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p><b>by McGeorge Bundy</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This report grew out of an effort by the Ford Foundation to
understand the massive and complex problem of drug abuse in the
United States and to determine the most effective ways in which
the Foundation might contribute to efforts to deal with the
problem. </p>

<p>Like many institutions working in such fields as education and
poverty, we encountered the growing blight of drug abuse
increasingly in the 1960's. The Foundation made a number of
grants to projects that dealt with drug abuse as an aspect of a
larger problem, as in work with high school students, faculty,
and parents to understand and overcome the alienation of youth.
As drug abuse increased, however, the Foundation considered
whether it might undertake a larger program. The study that led
to this report, undertaken in mid-1970, was the first step in
that consideration. </p>

<p>The second important step was to join with three other
foundations that have shared our concern with drug abuse-the
Carnegie Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation-in financing one of the principal
recommendations of the report, namely, the establishment of an
independent national Drug Abuse Council. The four foundations
have now committed substantial funds for the first several years
of the Council's work. </p>

<p>The functions of the Drug Abuse Council will include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Analysis of the development and results of public
        policies in the drug-abuse field </li>
    <li>Dissemination to the public of accurate data on the
        causes, extent, and treatment of drug abuse </li>
    <li>Promotion of needed research </li>
    <li>Synthesis and distribution of available information in
        research and treatment </li>
    <li>Evaluation of treatment and education programs </li>
</ul>

<p>Details of the Council's composition and plans are expected to
be announced shortly after this manuscript goes to press. </p>

<p>The report leading to the establishment of the Council-the
work of an outstanding independent task force of lawyers,
scientists, and other investigators-identified four major problem
areas in the drug-abuse field: heroin addiction in urban
ghettoes; drug experimentation by the young; overuse of legal
stimulants and tranquilizers; and the use of drugs to control
deviant behavior, especially among children. </p>

<p>The task-force report was intended principally for the Ford
Foundation's guidance. Yet, the scope and quality of the work
were such that the Foundation shared the first draft, in
December, 1970, with legal, scientific, and governmental
authorities active in efforts to control and prevent drug abuse.
The reaction to the report was strongly affirmative. The report
was praised for its thorough, clear, and sober analysis, and a
number of authorities urged the Foundation to make it available
to a wider audience. Accordingly, the Foundation asked the staff
of the developing Drug Abuse Council. to bring up to date those
sections dealing with aspects of the problem in which there had
been substantial change since the first draft was prepared. We
believe that this revised, expanded, and updated report is both a
forerunner and the first product of the Drug Abuse Council. As
such, we believe it is a promising harbinger of other
contributions the Council may make, both in understanding this
spreading danger to American society and in helping to curb it. </p>

<p>We hope that the report will be useful to the public at large
as well as to specialists, for the drug-abuse problem is so broad
and complex that effective efforts to overcome it will demand the
understanding and support of as many Americans as possible. <br>
