<DD>
Our administrative staff coordinates between Surrogate, Intended Parents, doctors, psychologists, laboratories, hospitals and attorneys.  (Doctors, psychologists, attorneys are independent professionals.)  Our skilled staff ensures that all necessary steps are taken and full documentation is in place prior to medical procedures.  CSP obtains all necessary legal clearances, monitors all aspects of the program, including disbursement of all expenses on behalf of the Intended Parents, and furnishes a full accounting to all parties.  We encourage all our clients to stay in close contact with our offices during this process.

<DT><B><I>INFERTILITY SPECIALISTS:</I></B>
<DD>
CSP works in conjunction with recognized infertility specialists who utilize advanced reproductive technologies.  These specialists are independent of CSP.  Infertility Specialists examines and verifies that the Surrogate is healthy, fertile and capable of having a normal, healthy child.  This medical examination is thorough, comprehensive and includes testing for venereal diseases, AIDS, and other conditions which may affect the health of the child or the Surrogate Mother.
