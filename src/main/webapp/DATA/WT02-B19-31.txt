This is the lab where <A HREF=/~bernardg/>Bernard</A> works. The machines in the foreground are Digital Alpha workstations.
In the background, you can see the DECstations (Digital workstations with
MIPS processors). To the left of the image are some vt320 terminals, which
are running a system for managing student pre-enrolment.
<P>
The image was made on the night of Wewdnesday, 4th of October 1995, using
a <A HREF="http://www.connectix.com/">Conectix</A> Quick Cam connected to
a macintosh, three different coloured cellophane filters, and xv on
<A HREF="http://marvin.eng.usyd.edu.au/about">marvin</A>
to combine the three images.
<P>
I've since made some <A HREF="qc.colour">other images like that</A>, and so has
