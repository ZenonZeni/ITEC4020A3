     <A NAME="6">6</A>    The House Report on the CSA contains several pages of
discussion about the proper treatment of marihuana under the CSA.
The House Report noted that:

     The extent to which marihuana should be controlled is a
     subject upon which opinions diverge widely.  There are
     some who not only advocate its legalization but would
     encourage its use; at the other extreme there are some
     States which have established the death penalty for
     distribution of marihuana to minors.

     <A NAME="7">7</A>    The Assistant Secretary for Health and scientific
Affairs wrote to Chairman Harley 0. Staggers that:

     Some question has been raised whether the use of the
     plant itself produces "severe psychological or physical
     dependence" as required by a schedule I or even
     schedule II criterion.  Since there is still a
     considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and
     effects of the active drug contained in it, our
     recommendation is that marihuana be retained within
     schedule I at least until the completion of certain
     studies now underway to resolve this issue.  If those
     studies make it appropriate for the Attorney General to
     change the placement of marihuana to a different
     schedule, he may do so in accordance with the authority
     provided under section 201 of the bill.

     Since the passage of the CSA, numerous individuals have

attempted to challenge the decision of Congress to place

marihuana in Schedule I as being irrational or unconstitutional.

These challenges have been uniformly rejected by the federal

courts.  See, e.g., <i>United States</i> v. <i>Greene</i>, 892 F.2d 453, 455-

456 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 935 (1990); <i>United</i>

<i>States</i> v. <i>Fogarty</i>, 692 F.2d 542, 547 (8th Cir. 1982), cert.

denied, 460 U.S. 1040 (1983); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Middleton</i>, 690

F.2d 820, 823 (11th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051

(1983); <i>National Org. for the Reform of Mariiuana Laws</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,

488 F. Supp. 123, 139-141 (D.D.C. 1980) (three judge court).

     In rejecting constitutional challenges to the initial

classification of marihuana, courts frequently have pointed out

that 21 U.S.C. 811(a) provides the Attorney General with the

authority to reclassify marihuana if scientific information later

demonstrates that Schedule I is not the appropriate schedule.

See, e.g., <i>Greene</i>, 892 F.2d at 456; <i>Fogarty</i>, 692 F.2d at 548;

<i>Middleton</i>, 690 F.2d at 823; <i>National Org. for the Reform of</i>

<i>Mariiuana Laws</i>, 488 F. Supp. at 141.  DEA, on behalf of the

Attorney General, recently conducted lengthy proceedings pursuant

to 811(a) and found that marihuana should not be moved from

Schedule I because the plant has no currently accepted medical

use and because it is not safe for use, even under medical

supervision.  These decisions were approved by this court.  See

footnote 2, <i>supra</i>.

<B>III. DEA PROPERLY FOUND THAT THE PETITION WAS NOT SUFFICIENT
     TO JUSTIFY ADDITIONAL RESCHEDULING PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE
     PETITION WAS PREMISED ON THE INCORRECT BELIEF THAT A
     SCHEDULE I DRUG MUST BE RESCHEDULED IF IT IS THE SOURCE OF
     AN ACCEPTED AND USEFUL MEDICATION.</B>

     In seeking to reschedule marihuana from Schedule I to

Schedule II, the petitioner made a rather creative argument based

upon several flawed premises.  DEA properly detected the flaws in

the petitioner's logic and found that the petition raised no

credible issue that would justify additional proceedings to

reschedule marihuana.

     <B>A.   THE PETITIONER'S ARGUMENT</B>

     The petitioner's argument was based entirely upon his

construction of language contained in then-Administrator Bonner's

response to an earlier letter sent by the petitioner.  In

response to the petitioner's query about why marihuana plants are

in Schedule I while coca leaves and opium plants are in Schedule

II, the Administrator stated that:

     In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in
     Schedule II, Congress was very much aware that these
     plant materials have historically been recognized as
     the source for a variety of accepted and useful
     medications.

A. 5.  The petitioner then seized upon the Administrator's

language as "general rules of statutory construction."  Pet. Br.

9.  Using the newly created rules of statutory construction as

his springboard, the petitioner took an additional logical leap

by inferring that if marihuana were found to be a "source for an

accepted and useful medication," it must be moved from Schedule I

to Schedule II.  A. 3-4.

                                13
<HR>
     Having created a new theory of statutory construction, the

petitioner proceeded to apply it with apparently successful

results.  He noted that a synthetic equivalent of the principal

psychoactive ingredient in marihuana recently had been moved from

Schedule I to Schedule II.  Since marihuana was the source of

this "accepted and useful medication," the petitioner concluded

that marihuana "must now be moved from Schedule I to Schedule II

of the CSA."  A. 4.

     <B>B.   THE CSA DOES NOT MANDATE THAT A SCHEDULE I
          DRUG MUST BE RESCHEDULED IF IT IS THE SOURCE
          OF AN ACCEPTED AND USEFUL MEDICATION BUT
          REQUIRES DEA TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL FINDINGS
          ABOUT A PARTICULAR DRUG PRIOR TO RESCHEDULING
          IT.</B>

     The premise of the petitioner's argument is that if a

Schedule I controlled substance is the source of an accepted and

useful medication, the Schedule I substance must be placed into

the schedule that contains the accepted and usef ul medication.

This premise is in direct conflict with the language of the CSA.

     As discussed previously, Congress itself decided to place

marihuana in Schedule I.  See <i>National Org. for the Reform of</i>

<i>Mariiuana Laws</i>, 488 F. Supp. at 141.  Although marihuana may be

rescheduled:

     [t]he clear meaning of section 812(c) is that Congress
     intended marijuana to remain in Schedule I until such
     time as it might be reclassified by the Attorney
     General on the basis of more complete scientific
     information about the drug.  In such a reclassification
     hearing, the statutory criteria would be the guides to
     determining the most appropriate schedule for
     marijuana.

Id.  Thus, under the CSA, marihuana plants should remain in

                                14
<HR>
Schedule I unless and until more complete information indicates

that placement in a different schedule is more appropriate.

     The CSA's language concerning the rescheduling of a

controlled substance does not suggest that a substance should be

rescheduled merely because it is the source for an accepted and

useful medication.  The CSA states that in order to transfer a

controlled substance from one schedule to another, the Attorney

General must make "with <i>respect to such druct or other substance</i>

the findings prescribed by" 21 U.S.C. 812(b) "for the schedule in

which <i>such drug</i> is to be placed." 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1)(B)

(emphasis added).  Under 812(b), "a drug or other substance may

not be placed in any schedule unless the findings required for

such schedule are made <i>with respect to such drug or other</i>

<i>substance</i>."  21 U.S.C. 812(b) (emphasis added).  Thus, contrary

to the petitioner's representations, the plain language of the

CSA states that in order for DEA to reschedule marihuana plants

from Schedule I to Schedule II, DEA must make the appropriate

findings with respect to <i>marihuana plants</i>.<A HREF="#8">8</A>

     The CSA states that DEA cannot move a drug from Schedule I

to Schedule II unless it finds, <i>inter alia</i>, that the "drug or

other substance" to be rescheduled has a currently accepted

____________________

     <A NAME="8">8</A>Thus, the Deputy Administrator was correct in stating that
"[w]hether or not marijuana is a source of delta-9-THC is
irrelevant to the status of marijuana under the CSA."  A. 20.
Despite the petitioner's assertions, this statement is not
inconsistent with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Walton</i>, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C.
Cir. 1975).  The statement simply indicates that each drug is
evaluated under 21 U.S.C. 812(b) based upon an independent
assessment of its features, not based upon other possible uses of
the chemicals contained within the drug.

                                15
<HR>
medical use.<A HREF="#9">9</A>  21 U.S.C. 812(b)(2)(B).  The CSA's language does

not state or imply that this criterion can be satisfied by a

substance that is the <i>source</i> of a drug with a currently accepted

medical use.  Additionally, the petitioner has produced no

authority to indicate that any controlled substance being

considered for rescheduling ever has been found to have a

currently accepted medical use merely because it was the source

of an "accepted and useful medication."10  Thus, marihuana

____________________

     <A NAME="9">9</A>    There are some instances in which courts have suggested
that the statutory criteria in 21 U.S.C. 812 are not mandatory,
but are factors to be used in a balancing process.  See, e.g.,
<i>Fogarty</i>, 692 F.2d at 548 ("the three statutory criteria for
Schedule I classification set out in S 812(b)(1) - high potential
for abuse, no medically accepted use, and no safe use even under
medical supervision - should not be read as being either
cumulative or exclusive"); <i>National Org. for the Reform of</i>
<i>Mariiuana Laws</i>, 559 F.2d at 748 ("placement in Schedule I does
not appear to flow inevitably from lack of a currently accepted
medical use"); <i>National Org. for the Reform of Mariiuana Laws</i>,
488 F. Supp. at 140 ("statutory criteria of section 812(b)(1) are
guides in determining the schedule to which a drug belongs, but
are not dispositive").  Although the meaning of these dicta is
somewhat unclear, DEA has interpreted the CSA to require that a
controlled substance placed by Congress in Schedule I may not be
rescheduled into Schedule II unless it has a currently accepted
medical use.  See 54 Fed. Reg. at 53,773; 57 Fed. Reg. at 10,499.
Nothing in this court's recent marihuana rescheduling cases
suggests that DEA's interpretation is incorrect.  See <i>Alliance</i>
<i>for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 15 F.3d at 1133; <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i>
<i>Therapeutics</i>, 930 F.2d at 938-940.  If there is a tension between
some language in older cases and DEA's interpretation of the CSA,
DEA's reasonable interpretation of the CSA is entitled to
deference under <i>Chevron</i>, 467 U.S. at 843-845.

     <A NAME="10">10</A>   In fact, there is authority to the contrary.  In 1993,
the DEA proposed to reschedule the levo isomer of
alphacetylmethadol while leaving all other isomers of
alphacetylmethadol in Schedule I because the levo isomer had been
approved by the FDA for treatment of narcotic addiction.  See 58
Fed. Reg. 25,790 (1993).  Levo-alphacetylmethadol was
subsequently placed in Schedule II.  See 21 C.F.R.
1308.12(c)(11).  Despite the petitioner's "rules of statutory
construction," alphacetylmethadol (the source of this accepted

                                16
<HR>
plants themselves must have a "currently accepted medical use" in

order to satisfy the rescheduling criterion in 21 U.S.C.

812(b)(2)(B).  Because the petitioner's request raised no doubts

about DEA's recent findings that marihuana plants have no

currently accepted medical use, DEA acted properly when it

declined to initiate proceedings to reschedule marihuana

plants.<A HREF="#11">11</A>

     The petitioner's novel theory that a source of an accepted

and useful medication must be moved out of Schedule I is rooted

in a misinterpretation of the then-Administrator's letter.

Although the letter attempted to explain why Congress may have

chosen to place coca leaves and opium plants in Schedule II,

nothing in the letter states or even suggests that Congress, the

Attorney General, DEA or the courts have adopted a general rule

of statutory construction that whenever a plant is the source of

an accepted and useful medication, it must be rescheduled.

Further, nothing in the letter suggests that its text was

intended to serve as some type of binding administrative

interpretation of the CSA.  The letter was simply an informal

response to a citizen's question about DEA's recent refusal to

and useful medication) remains in Schedule I.  See 21 C.F.R.
1308.11(b)(4).

     <A NAME="11">11</A>   Even if the statutory language were not clear, DEA's
interpretation of the CSA certainly would be permissible.  The
petitioner can point to nothing in the statute, the legislative
history or elsewhere that would suggest that the interpretation
is not reasonable.  Accordingly, even if the CSA is ambiguous,
this court should affirm DEA's interpretation.  See <i>Chevron</i>, 467
U.S. at 843-844.

                                17
<HR>
reschedule marihuana.  Such an informal unpublished letter that

does not even purport to be a final agency action cannot have a

binding effect on DEA.  See <i>Independent Ins, Agents of Am., Inc.</i>

v. <i>Ludwig</i>, 997 F.2d 958, 962 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (finding that six

unpublished letters of Comptroller of the Currency provided no

reliable evidence of Comptroller policy); <i>USAA Fed. Sav. Bank</i> v.

<i>McLaughlin</i>, 849 F.2d 1505, 1508-1509 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (finding

that informal unpublished letter in response to individuals

specific inquiry did not constitute definitive statement of

Department of Labor policy).

     Although there may be some arguable inconsistency between

the scheduling of marihuana plants and the scheduling of coca

leaves and opium plant material, such would not be irrational or

contrary to the CSA.  Congress placed all of these substances in

their CSA schedules.  These scheduling decisions have been upheld

as rational and constitutional.  See, e.g., <i>United States</i> v.

<i>Whitley</i>, 734 F.2d 1129, 1141 (6th Cir. 1984) (not irrational or

unreasonable for Congress to classify cocaine as narcotic

substance under Schedule II of CSA even though cocaine is non-

narcotic central nervous system stimulant); <i>National Org. for the</i>

<i>Reform of Mariluana Laws</i>, 488 F. Supp. at 140 (even if marihuana

does not fall within literal reading of Schedule I,

classification in Schedule I is rational and furthers regulatory

purposes of Congress).  DEA and the courts have conducted reviews

of the scheduling decision and have determined that marihuana

should remain in Schedule I. See <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i>

                                18
<HR>
<i>Therapeutics</i>, 15 F.3d at 1137.  Since the petitioner presented no

new medical, scientific or other information to suggest that

circumstances have changed since DEA's last review, DEA acted

properly when it refused to conduct additional hearings in

response to the petitioner's request to move marihuana from

Schedule I to Schedule II.

<b>IV.  THE ADMINISTRATOR PROPERLY DENIED THE PETITION BECAUSE
     IT RELIED ON THE INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT DRONABINOL
     HAS BEEN MOVED TO SCHEDULE II WHEN IN FACT ONLY A
     SINGLE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT HAS BEEN MOVED TO
     SCHEDULE II.</b>

     In addition to relying on a mistaken interpretation of the

CSA, the petitioner also appeared to rely incorrectly upon the

premise that all forms of dronabinol have been rescheduled from

Schedule I to Schedule II.  DEA did not promulgate such a

sweeping rule.  Rather, DEA has merely rescheduled one particular

pharmaceutical product that has been approved by the FDA.

     In May of 1985, the FDA approved a new drug application for

Marinol Capsules, which was submitted by Unimed Incorporated.

Marinol Capsules contain specified quantities of synthetic

dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in round soft gelatin

capsules.  See 50 Fed. Reg. 42,186 (1985).  DEA then issued a

notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to move this pharmaceutical

product (and no other Schedule I substance) to Schedule II.  <i>Id</i>.

After following appropriate rulemaking procedures, on May 13,

1986, the Administrator issued a rule:

     to transfer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
     approved drug products that consist of synthetic
     dronabinol in sesame oil encapsulated in soft gelatin
     capsules from Schedule I into Schedule II of the

                                19
<HR>
     Controlled Substances Act (CSA).  Dronabinol is the
     synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9-
     tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the principal
     psychoactive substance in Cannabis sativa L.,
     marijuana.  This action is based on a finding that U.S.
     Food and Drug Administration approved drug products
     which contain dronabinol fit the statutory criteria for
     inclusion in Schedule II of the CSA. . . .  <i>This rule
     does not affect the Schedule I status of any other
     substance, mixture or preparation which is currently
     included in 21-CFR 1308-11(d)(21),
     Tetrahydrocannabinols.</i>

51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (1986) (emphasis added).

     This rule clearly indicates that only a very specific

substance ("Marinol") was moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.

See 21 C.F.R. 1308.12(f)(1).  DEA did not transfer any other

dronabinol products to Schedule II nor did it transfer all

tetrahydrocannabinols or all cannabis products to Schedule II.

See 51 Fed. Reg. at 17,476 ("Dronabinol and all mixtures,

compounds and preparations thereof, except dronabinol in sesame

oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules in a FDA approved

product, remain in Schedule I").  Thus, marihuana plants and

tetrahydrocannabinols remain listed in Schedule I.  See 21 C.F.R.

1308.11(d)(18) and 1308.11(d)(26).<A HREF="#12">12</A>

     In rejecting the petitioner's request in this case, DEA's

final order correctly explained that dronabinol remains in

Schedule I of the CSA and that only Marinol was placed in

Schedule II in 1986.  A. 23.  Faced with this explanation and the

____________________

     <A NAME="12">12</A>   Unlike Marinol, marijuana plants contain varying
quantities of over 400 chemicals, including THC, that cannot be
reproduced in standardized dosages.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.
Additionally, no currently approved medicine is administered by
smoking.  <i>Id</i>. at 10,499.

                                20
<HR>
clear language of DEA's final rule of 1986, the petitioner has

changed his argument.  He now claims that dronabinol should have

been placed in Schedule II when the pharmaceutical product

Marinol was rescheduled in 1986.  Thus, for the first time on

appeal, the petitioner appears to be challenging the propriety of

the DEA rule that rescheduled Marinol from Schedule I to Schedule

II.<A HREF="#13">13</A>  See 51 Fed. Reg. at 17,476.

     The petitioner did not seek this relief below.  Nothing in

his petition to DEA suggested that he was challenging the

validity of the rescheduling of Marinol.  Similarly, nothing in

the petition suggested that he was petitioning DEA to reschedule

dronabinol or some other substance to Schedule II.  The petition

only asked DEA to reschedule marihuana.  See A. 2-4.  To the

extent that petitioner seeks relief that he did not request in

the proceedings before DEA or challenges the validity of a rule

he did not previously challenge, he should be precluded from

raising these issues for the first time on appeal because he has

failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.  See <i>Cutler</i> v.

<i>Hayes</i>, 818 F.2d 879, 890-891 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <i>Randolph-Sheppard</i>

____________________

     <A NAME="13">13</A>   Contrary to the petitioner's assertions, DEA's actions
in rescheduling Marinol were not in conflict with the holding of
<i>Grinspoon</i> v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>, 828 F.2d 881, 891-892 (lst
Cir. 1987).  In <i>Grinspoon</i>, the court specifically found that FDA
approval was sufficient to establish an accepted medical use for
rescheduling determinations under the CSA.  Id. at 890.  Thus,
DEA properly initiated rescheduling proceedings for Marinol after
it received FDA approval.  See 50 Fed. Reg. at 42,186.  Although
the <i>Grinspoon</i> court found that the lack of FDA approval did not
preclude a finding of accepted medical use, DEA was not faced
with such a case; the 1985 petition only sought to reschedule
Marinol, a substance that had been approved by the FDA.

                                21
<HR>
<i>Vendors of America</i> v. <i>Weinberger</i>, 795 F.2d 90, 104-105 (D.C. Cir.

1986).  The court should require the petitioner to exhaust his

administrative remedies on these additional issues because (1) it

is necessary to discourage this prolific petitioner from

frequently and deliberately flouting the administrative process

by raising new issues for the first time on appeal; (2) DEA

should have the first opportunity to consider these issues and

apply its technical expertise in order to protect its autonomy

from judicial intrusion; (3) the record before this court on

these issues is incomplete because the issues were not discussed

in the administrative proceeding; and (4) judicial economy will

be enhanced if the administrative proceedings obviate the need

for judicial involvement.  See <i>Fertilizer Institute</i> v. <i>United</i>

<i>States Envtl. Protection Agency</i>, 935 F.2d 1303, 1312-1313 (D.C.

Cir. 1991); Cutler, 818 F.2d at 890-891.

     The petitioner is free to bring a separate challenge to the

validity of the rulemaking that rescheduled Marinol or to

petition DEA to reschedule dronabinol or some other substance.

However, no purpose would be served by remanding the instant case

to address either challenge.  Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the

petitioner could prevail on either challenge, he could not

achieve the ultimate relief he sought in this proceeding --

rescheduling of marihuana plants -- because the language of the

CSA clearly indicates that the scheduling of other substances has

no bearing on the proper scheduling of marihuana plants.
