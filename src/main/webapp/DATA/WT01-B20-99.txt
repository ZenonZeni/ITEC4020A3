<BR>Carl,
<BR>
<DD>I just wanted to write you a letter and let you know how it's going with me.&nbsp;  As I'm sure you've heard, I was busted on February 13 by U.S. Customs & DEA SWAT teams at my house in Minneapolis.&nbsp;  I was originally charged with conspiracy for over 1,000 kilos of pot, money laundering and 5 counts of possession with intent to distribute.&nbsp;  Everyone on my indictment became informers except me.&nbsp;  Even when told I faced 20 years of federal time, I refused to even meet with narcs, or say anything at all about my activities.&nbsp;  In June I pled guilty to one count of possession of 500 pounds in February 1992.&nbsp;  In August I was sentenced to 63 months in the Bureau of Prisons.
<DD>The state of Texas is currently revoking my probation on an 80 pound possession charge, also from 1992, that may or may not result in more time.&nbsp;  I am presently on my way (hopefully) to a federal corrections institute in Minnesota.&nbsp;  Some people have insinuated that my arrest, like similar arrests of people like Arlin Troutt and Dennis Peron, have discredited the Grassroots Party and the Hemp Movement.&nbsp;  This is absurd.
<DD>The only "crime" I have ever been convicted of is possession of marijuana - the breaking of an unjust and unreasonable law.&nbsp;  The same goes for Arlin and Dennis.&nbsp;  Any you.&nbsp;  I am angry and disgusted by certain elements who are trying to defame people like us who have put their lives on the line to further a righteous cause.&nbsp;  I am not saying that everyone should break the marijuana laws, but I am sickened by self-righteous hypocrites who condemn those of us who have been arrested and given up years of our lives for nothing more than possession of a plant that is a gift from God.&nbsp;  There are three equally important aspects of the cannabis legalization issue: industrial, medical and HUMAN RIGHTS.&nbsp;  Human rights encompasses personal and religious use.&nbsp;  I have always said that the Hemp Movement will only be successful when all three aspects are accorded equal importance.
<DD>There are between 100,000 and a quarter million Americans in prison today for marijuana alone.&nbsp;  Their cause is EVERY BIT as legitimate and vital as that of medical users or "industrial use" advocates.
<DD>For one group of Hemp Activists to look down their noses at another is ridiculous and counter-productive.&nbsp;  It should be remembered that the purpose and intent of the laws against marijuana is the total eradication and extinction of the cannabis plant.&nbsp;  Were it not for "outlaws" who have kept the cannabis species alive over the last 60 years, the industrial and medical use advocates may well not have had a plant to be talking about.
<DD>Ghandi said, "We have a moral obligation to disobey unrighteous laws."&nbsp;  Thoreau said, "In a land where any are imprisoned unjustly, the only place for a truly just man is in prison."&nbsp;  I agree with them both.&nbsp;  I did not become an activist after my arrest - I've been at it for over seven years, and I've worked as hard and given as much as anyone in this movement has.&nbsp;  Now I am giving 5 years of my life in federal prison.
<DD>Marijuana prisoners ask for no special accolades or recognition - we know ourselves the worth of our sacrifice and dedication, for we are the ones who must pay its price.&nbsp;  But we do not deserve the condemnation and recrimination of anyone who claims to fight for Truth and Justice.&nbsp;  The Hemp Movement is stuggling to change a law that will change the world.&nbsp;  We need all the help we can get, and we must work together.&nbsp;  You keep doing your job, and we'll keep doin' ours.
<DD>Until We Win,
<DD>Russell "Bongo" Bentley

<BR>P.S.&nbsp;  I don't know how much time you have for reading, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LIVING IN TRUTH by VACLAC HAVEL.&nbsp;  Read it, you'll be glad you did.
