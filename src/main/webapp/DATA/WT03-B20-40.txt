<H2>Chapter 4: Develop a Balanced Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio </H2>
<HR><P>

<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I><P>

 

To achieve the goals of increased energy productivity, pollution prevention, and enhanced national

security, the Nation must make the most efficient use of a diverse portfolio of domestic energy

resources that will allow us to meet our energy needs today, tomorrow, and well into the 21st

century. The Administration continues to promote the economically beneficial and environmentally

sound expansion of domestic energy resources.<BR>

<P>

Our domestic energy resources include coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear energy, and renewable

energy (primarily hydropower, biomass, geothermal, and wind). About 85 percent of the energy

we consume comes from fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas (see Figure 14). In the year

2010, we undoubtedly will use greater amounts of renewable energy resources, but still will rely

primarily on the energy resources that we use today. Further into the 21st century, we could rely

much more heavily on solar and other renewable resources, and our energy portfolio may include

hydrogen and fusion energy. <BR>

<P>

Sustainable development of energy resources means that we must efficiently use our existing

domestic resources today and augment the resources that are available for the future. Some

domestic resources, such as natural gas and oil, must be developed in ways that ensure these

resources are not abandoned and are economically accessible. Developing and deploying advanced

energy technologies today will ensure that we will have the necessary means to produce and use

our energy resources when we need them. Maximizing the cost-effective use of our relatively clean

energy resources, such as renewables and natural gas, will ensure that future generations will

inherit a cleaner environment.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.1">The Federal Role in Helping To Develop a Domestic Energy Resource Portfolio</H4></a>

The Federal Government has a vital role to play in the development of energy technology and in

the stewardship of our domestic natural resources. The private sector alone may not provide all of

the technology that we will need to find, produce, and use our domestic energy resources and to

compete in world energy markets. Even the largest energy companies often are unwilling to make

substantial investments in long-term and high-risk research and development (R&D). Through

partnership with industry, the Federal Government can help develop and demonstrate promising,

but still unproven, advanced energy supply and utilization technologies-especially those

technologies that have substantial public benefits such as improved environmental performance.

To the extent that the private sector cannot or will not do so, the Federal Government invests at all

stages of technology development to ensure that all Americans will have the clean and affordable

energy they will need in the future.<BR>

<P>

In the near term, Federal policy helps ensure that our energy industries remain viable, providing

jobs for Americans and energy to the Nation. By supporting our energy industries through

appropriate tax treatment, sound regulatory decisionmaking, and R&D programs that help reduce

costs, the Federal Government can help ensure that U.S. industries will continue to meet the

competitive challenges of the global economy.<BR>

<P>

To maintain economic growth and enhance national security, we must diversify our energy

resources and increase the efficiency of energy use. To ensure a cleaner environment, we must

increase our use of cleaner energy resources, such as renewables and natural gas, and we must

develop technologies that will allow us to produce and use existing energy resources in ways that

will result in fewer harmful effects on the environment.<BR>

<P>

To achieve our national goals, the Administration is working to promote the efficient development

and use of a domestic energy resource portfolio by-<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>Partnering with industry to research, develop, and deploy advanced technologies that will

allow industry to explore for, produce, develop, and use our domestic energy resources more

efficiently, more safely, with fewer harmful effects on the environment, and in more applications<BR>

<P>

<li>Providing appropriate tax and other fiscal incentives to support our domestic energy

resource industries<BR>

<P>

<li>Stimulating markets for clean energy technologies, such as natural gas and renewable

energy<BR>

<P>

<li>Reforming and streamlining regulations to make energy markets more efficient, to allow

our domestic energy resources to compete in energy markets, and to better weigh costs against

risks<BR>

<P>

<li>Promoting U.S. energy resources and advanced energy technologies abroad<BR>

<P></ul>

As discussed below, the Administration's policy is to apply the appropriate tools to each sector,

and to make the best use of taxpayer dollars by aligning budgetary priorities with national goals.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.2">Oil: Enhancing Domestic Production Capability</H4></a>

The growing level of U.S. oil consumption raises potential economic and national security

concerns. In addition to emphasizing efficient use of oil products and enhancing fuel flexibility,

national energy policy must address declining domestic production levels with minimum

interference with market forces. The Administration's policy is to improve the economics of

domestic oil production by reducing costs, in order to lessen the impact on this industry of low and

volatile prices.<BR>

<P>

Petroleum products account for nearly 40 percent of the energy consumed in the United States, and

this share is expected by most analysts to remain constant for the next decade. Investment in oil

exploration and production activity in the United States is related directly to the price of oil in

international markets as well as to costs of domestic production. Exploration and production

spending by major U.S. oil companies is increasing overseas, rather than in the United States, and

independent producers increasingly are unable to respond alone to the technically demanding and

highly volatile price environment that characterizes the oil industry.<BR>

<P>

U.S. crude oil production decreased for most of the 1970s, stabilized or increased slightly in the

early 1980s (mostly because of production in Alaska), and has been decreasing since 1986. Oil

fields are being abandoned at an increasingly high rate, resulting in the loss of billions of barrels of

oil reserves each year.<BR>

<P>

At the same time, industry cost-cutting since 1986 has yielded domestic finding costs similar to

foreign finding costs, and technical innovation is increasing production efficiency. Still, the

domestic oil industry is characterized mainly by marginal, high-cost production. The few areas of

high production at lower per-barrel costs-parts of Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and deep

formations in the Rockies and elsewhere-have not offset the decline in the domestic resource base.

With declining industry profitability caused by low prices and high price volatility, long-term

industry R&D spending dropped by $400 million per year between 1985 and 1992, and the

decline is continuing. The consequences of this decline in private R&D not only are being felt

today, but will be especially severe after the turn of the century if the introduction of new

exploration and production technologies effectively stops. <BR>

<P>

The price of oil is set by the world market; the U.S. Government cannot exert much influence on

this critical component of industry revenues. Consequently, the best opportunity for the Federal

Government to improve the economics of domestic oil production is to help reduce costs.

Throughout the Federal Government, the Administration is pursuing various ways of lowering

costs, including R&D support, and targeted tax and regulatory reform.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.3">Partnering With Industry To Develop Advanced Supply Technologies</H4></a>

Continued development and deployment of <a name="ad"></a>advanced technology can ameliorate the decline in domestic oil production through enhanced recovery in existing fields and increased ability to find new sources. Advanced technologies reduce operating costs, improve process reliability, develop flexible processes, and meet environmental requirements. <BR>

<P>

The Administration supports government- industry cost-sharing partnerships to meet high-priority needs. The Department of Energy's oil R&D program addresses these needs, which include maintaining access to valuable reserves threatened by shut-in, recovering more of the oil resource in the ground, finding oil in geologically difficult areas, and complying with environmental requirements.<BR>

<P>

By 2010, it is estimated that domestic oil production linked to the deployment of advanced

exploration and production technologies supported by the Administration will be 1 million barrels

per day.<BR>

<P>

Through the Department of Energy's Advanced Computation Technology Initiative (ACTI), the

Federal Government also is making available to domestic oil and gas producers extraordinary

computational and modeling skills developed by the Department's weapons laboratories as part of

their national security mission. These cutting-edge computer technologies can aid in the search for

new resources and can optimize extraction from existing reservoirs.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.4">Providing Appropriate Incentives To Increase Domestic Exploration and Production</H4></a>

Although limited by the need to reduce the Federal budget deficit, financial incentives can provide

support and reduce barriers to selected promising activities that the private sector deems too risky

to develop or that are at risk of premature abandonment during periods of depressed market prices.

Financial incentives can take many forms, including reductions in Federal income taxes, reduced

royalty rates for natural gas or oil production on Federal lands, and assistance to the industry in

improving access to capital markets.<BR>

<P>

One of our best opportunities for adding large new oil reserves can be found in the central and

western Gulf of Mexico, particularly in deeper water. Royalty relief can be a key to timely access

to this important resource. The Administration supports targeted royalty relief to encourage the

production of domestic oil and natural gas resources in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. This step

will help to unlock the estimated 15 billion barrels of oil-equivalent in the deepwater Gulf of

Mexico, providing new energy supplies for the future, spurring the development of new

technologies, and supporting thousands of jobs in the gas and oil industry and affiliated industries.<BR>

<P>

The Administration also supports a royalty rate reduction for onshore heavy-oil wells to improve

ultimate recovery and increase the domestic oil reserve base. The Department of the Interior's

Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has proposed a rulemaking that would provide royalty relief

for heavy-oil wells. This relief would reduce the abandonment rate for marginally economic

heavy-oil wells and would increase reserves by up to 40 million barrels of oil.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.5">Reforming Regulations To Reduce Uncertainties and Costs</H4></a>

Throughout the Federal Government, the Administration is working to streamline regulations

governing all industries and, in particular, the oil industry. These reforms will have significant

benefits for natural gas producers as well. Virtually all aspects of the oil industry are governed by

regulations concerning environmental issues, exploration and production activities, royalties, and

taxes. The current Federal and State regulatory framework lacks incentives for cost-effective

pollution control and innovation and adoption of promising technologies. These regulations are

often complex, duplicative, and inflexible. Industry faces increased regulatory uncertainty and high

compliance costs, while Federal, State, and local governments also spend more than necessary on

implementing and enforcing regulations.<BR>

<P>

The Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS), which manages the

leasing of Federal outer continental shelf (OCS) petroleum and natural gas resources, is reviewing

its regulations in the following areas: (1) deepwater production rules governing subsea installations

and the flaring or venting of small amounts of gas; (2) blowout, safety, and pollution prevention

equipment; (3) conservation and diligent development requirements; (4) management of

directional survey drilling; (5) requirements regarding construction and removal of platforms; (6)

daily pollution inspection requirements; and (7) training. Regulatory changes may be appropriate

for all of these areas, and MMS is studying proposals to address these issues.<BR>

<P>

MMS has completed a negotiated rulemaking process for gas valuation on Federal leases and

initiated similar efforts for Indian leases. MMS issued final regulations facilitating company

recoupment of certain payments associated with OCS leases and is examining regulations to

reduce or eliminate certain reporting requirements and to make it easier and cheaper for companies

to properly report and pay royalties. MMS is looking at changes to lease terms and royalty rates

that would encourage more domestic production.<BR>

<P>

The Royalty Management Program, which governs the collection of royalty revenues from Federal

onshore and offshore lands, is being reviewed in the following areas: (1) valuation of natural gas

from unitized properties, and the responsibilities of payers and lessees; (2) procedures for

obtaining refunds and credits for excess royalty payments from OCS production; (3) penalties and

assessments for improper reporting; and (4) streamlining of the MMS administrative appeals

process.<BR>

<P>

The BLM has conducted a sweeping review of its oil and gas leasing program to make its onshore

leasing program more efficient and responsive. In April 1995, the review team published its

report, which contained a list of proposals for improving the onshore oil and gas leasing program.

Examples of these proposals include the following: simplifying unitization and communications

agreements; simplifying requirements related to oil sampling and to gas flaring and venting;

eliminating duplicate bonding requirements; developing a pilot program for environmental

compliance self-certification; and selectively increasing bonding amounts for problem-prone

operations.<BR>

<P>

The Department of Energy also is funding the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in an

effort to streamline regulations governing the exploration and production of oil and natural gas on

Federal lands. The Commission has convened a working group to examine State and Federal

requirements on Federal lands and to recommend ways to reduce duplication, share information

and resources, and reduce costs. This 3-year effort focuses on the States with the greatest amount

of production from Federal land: California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.6">Removing Artificial Market Barriers</H4></a>

The Administration supports lifting the ban on the export of Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil.

ANS crude oil is geographically convenient to only 20 percent of U.S. refining capacity. Since the

North Slope reached full production in the mid-1970s, ANS crude oil that cannot be used on the

West Coast has had to be shipped more than 13,000 miles to Gulf Coast markets. Confronted with

this expensive option, ANS producers have been forced to sell ANS crude on the West Coast at

prices considerably lower than the oil's value to refiners. Historically, this discount also has helped

to depress California crude oil prices.<BR>

<P>

Removing the ban on exporting ANS crude oil will allow the marginal supply of ANS crude to

seek its true value in world markets. It will create additional employment, raise royalty collection

for the Federal Government and revenues for the States of Alaska and California, and lift domestic

oil production by roughly 100,000 barrels per day. ANS exports will contribute to energy

production and economic growth, without employment dislocation, environmental degradation, or

significant increases in retail petroleum product prices. In the event of an oil emergency, the

President could terminate the exports.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.7">Supporting Exploration and Production of New Supplies in Environmentally Sensitive Ways</H4></a>

The Administration supports exploration for and production of oil and natural gas in areas that are

not environmentally sensitive. For example, through technology R&D and appropriate financial

incentives, the Administration is <a name="expp"></a>supporting exploration and production of oil and natural gas in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. More than 40 million acres of public lands are covered by oil and gas leases, and BLM has issued competitive oil and gas leases on more than 4 million acres of public lands and has approved more than 4,300 drilling permits in the past 2 years.<BR>

<P>

The Administration continues to oppose opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)

and certain Outer Continental Shelf areas for oil and natural gas development. ANWR is just one

part of the Alaska North Slope oil exploration and development picture. There are extensive State

and Federal lands that can be developed without the need for development in ANWR, and the

Alaska Department of Natural Resources' Oil and Gas Division estimates that about 6.2 billion

barrels of oil remain to be developed on the North Slope outside of ANWR.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="4.8">Reforming the Regulatory Structure Governing Refining Activities</H4> </a>

The Administration's policy is to simplify the complex regulatory structure governing refining

activities and capital investment. This will speed investment in clean, efficient, and competitive

refining technologies.<BR>

<P>

U.S. refining capacity increased by almost 50 percent during the 1970s, but fell during the 1980s

and has remained in the range of 15 million to 16 million barrels per day so far in the 1990s. The

configuration of the industry has changed substantially over this period. While U.S. refining

capacity today is close to what it was in the mid-1970s, the number of operable refineries has

dropped by one-third, reflecting the trend away from smaller, more inefficient refineries, and the

capacity to process heavier, high-sulfur crude oils has increased significantly. On a capacity basis,

the ability to remove sulfur from petroleum products has doubled. The net result is that U.S.

refineries are able to process heavier, higher sulfur crude oils and make a wider range of light

petroleum products than they could in the 1970s or even in the 1980s. <BR>

<P>

Today's refineries are cleaner, and the products they manufacture are less damaging to the

environment. Lead has been phased out of gasoline; and, as a result of the lowering of its vapor

pressure, gasoline is less likely to emit toxic substances such as benzene. Sulfur content in diesel

fuel and residual oils is substantially lower. <BR>

<P>

Virtually all of these improvements have resulted from Federal and State environmental regulation,

but such regulations have become expensive. The National Petroleum Council estimated that

capital expenditures of $37 billion (1990 dollars) will be needed in the refining industry between

1991 and the year 2000 for product quality and stationary source regulatory compliance.<BR>

<P>

The challenge of the 1990s for the petroleum refining industry is to find ways to become more

efficient and clean and to reduce the costs of environmental compliance. If the regulatory burden

on domestic refiners drives the industry offshore, energy security concerns will intensify.<BR>

<P>

Addressing these issues, the Environmental Protection Agency's Common Sense Initiative is

designed to identify "cheaper, cleaner, smarter" ways of achieving our environmental objectives.

The initiative brings together industry, the States, the Federal Government, and public interest

groups to identify and implement both short- and long-term opportunities to simplify

environmental regulations and policies. In the oil refinery sector, the initiative will identify the

permit, regulatory, and statutory areas of flexibility that will increase the refining industry's

flexibility and lower its costs, without sacrificing environmental performance.<BR>

<P>

Additionally, the Department of Energy's Refinery of the Future initiative is assisting the refining

industry to hasten the transition from responding to command and control environmental

regulation to developing and adopting pollution-avoidance and resource conservation technologies.

The Department will assist industry in developing and deploying novel or improved high-priority

process technologies and an advanced technology base that will (1) maintain or enhance industry

competitiveness, (2) foster the evolution of more economic approaches for reducing effluent

hazardous and nonhazardous waste streams, (3) improve overall refinery energy efficiency, and

(4) promote greater flexibility in utilization of alternative energy, feedstock, and raw material

inputs.</BODY><HR>
