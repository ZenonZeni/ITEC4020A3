Customer Services, <br>
Bromley Council, Stockwell Close, <br>
Bromley  BR1 3UH<br>
<br>
Attention : Tom Dent<br><br>

Dear sir,<br><br>

I am writing to notify you of an apparent breach of the
Trade Descriptions Act, and to lodge a formal
complaint. Please forgive the length and detail of this
letter. The complaint involves a complex technical
project about which there is only limited public
information. For this reason I feel it is important that I
present a full background to the subject area.
<P>
I am making this complaint to Bromley Council
because I viewed the offending material in the
Bromley area.<P>

This complaint involves the activities of Mondex Ltd,
a partnership between the Midland and National
Westminster Banks.  Since June of this year, Mondex
has been engaged in a trial of smart cards which
are designed to replace cash.  The trial is being
conducted in Swindon.<P>

The Mondex cards (being given to Midland and
National Westminster bank customers)  can
electronically store the value of cash authorised from
a bank ATM machine or by way of specially adapted
payphones connected to the customers bank.<P>

Instead of handing over cash to a store, customers
hand over the card, which acts in place of cash. The
card is inserted into a machine which debits the
amount of the transaction.  Because it is a debit card
(that is, customers have already paid for the value of
cash contained in it)  no signature or authorisation is
needed. The relevant amount is electronically
deducted from the card.  Many big High Street
retailers, including Boots, Asda, Safeway, J
Sainsbury, WH Smith, BP and McDonald's are
participating in the scheme. Currently, six thousand
people are using the  cards in Swondon, and
Mondex hopes this will rise to as many as 40,000.<P>

<H3>Some background</H3>

I should explain at this point that a smart card is a
credit-card size device containing a microchip, which
can store and process considerable amounts of data.
Most smart cards can hold several A4 pages of data.
The smart card can independently process this data,
and present it in different forms according to
requirements. Information on the chip can be
locked with a PIN number, and protected through a
range of encryption methods. These cards have
been developed in various countries for health,
social welfare benefits, transport, and financial
transactions.<P>

The Mondex trial is being eagerly watched by banks
and governments around the world.  The common
view of these bodies is that cash is a costly,
cumbersome and messy commodity. It is insecure
and untraceable. UK banks estimate that they spend
2 billion a year on cash distribution, and the cost to
retailers has been put at 800 million. Banks want to
save money not only by taking cash out of the
system, but also by charging customers and retailers
for an alternative system that avoids the traditional
drawbacks. A cash smart card is one way of
achieving this.<P>

The Mondex experiment is widely seen as crucial to
the future of electronic cash worldwide. Mondex has
signed up Midland's sister company,
HongkongBank, as the first overseas partner.
HongkongBank has acquired the rights to franchise
Mondex in Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia,
Macau, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. Trevor Blackler,
NatWest's chief executive of group services, has
been reported as saying discussions are being
conducted with 30 banks in 15 countries around the
world.<P>

While the Mondex experiment is at the cutting edge,
other banks are not far behind. Barclays and Lloyds
are in partnership with Visa International to pioneer
an international system that may, in effect, create a
single international cash unit of currency.  The Visa
International project is co-operating with bank-led
groups in Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan
and the US. Like Mondex, it plans to create an
extensive network of shop-based card readers.<P>

The importance of this project, nationally and
internationally, cannot be easily overstated. The
concept of electronic cash is almost certain to take
hold throughout Europe, particularly in the lead-up to
a single unit of currency. In 1995, European
Commission premises across Europe are to act as
host to a trial of an electronic multi -currency
payment system similar to the one being pioneered
by Mondex.  The technology is known more
popularly in Europe as an electronic purse. Under
the EU's own research programme in Information
Technology, a seven-country consortium of partners
in industry and academia has developed the purse,
which can be loaded with money from the owner's
bank account, then used to meet expenses in ECU
and national currencies by down -loading payments
into compatible terminals in shops, pay-phones, toll
roads, public transport and so on.<P>

At the same time, a specialized working group
attached to the European Committee for
Standardization (CEN) is on the point of developing
a European standard that could open the door to
cross-border use of electronic cash. An international
standard has already been finalised for point-of-sale
machinery for the cards. Thirteen European
countries have been  involved since 1991 in the
effort.<P>

The mechanism of the Mondex system is complex.
Each card is linked to an existing bank account.  The
card can be topped up, or the security instructions
changed, by using any ATM or modified pay phone.
Although the card is a direct substitute for cash, it can
be made more secure than cash. The owner can
encode it with a PIN number which locks the cash
value, and thus makes the card useless for anyone
else.<P>

<H3>The complaint</H3>

Mondex has consistently promoted its product as
privacy friendly, anonymous, and cash-like. These
are important selling points of the Mondex product,
because many people value their financial privacy,
and would support a technology that offers secure
and anonymous transactions.   However, I dispute
the claims made by Mondex, and will set out below
evidence that I believe will show that Mondex has set
out intentionally to deceive the public. Transactions
using the cards are neither anonymous nor are they
privacy friendly.<P>

In the Mondex Home Page - an electronic
promotional advertisement located on the internet,
Mondex makes the following statement:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     What about privacy?<p>

     In everyday use Mondex transactions are
     anonymous, just like cash.<p>

      However, if the card is lost, a unique 16-digit identity
     number stored on the chip, which will have been
     registered by a card-providing bank against the
     personal details of the customer, may be used in
     order to return the card to its rightful owner.
     Cards also contain a "purse narrative". The
     customer's narrative would contain the names of the
     retailers - letting them know where they have used
     their card.<p>

     Only a cardholder will have access to the statement
     entries on their card which detail transactions. A
     cardholder will be able to lock their card and prevent
     unauthorised access.<p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here, Mondex has made the case for privacy, setting
out in very specific terms the way the data will be
restricted.  The statement Only a cardholder will
have access to the statement entries on their card
which detail transactions  sets out to reassure the
public that Big Brother will not be a party to the
system.<p>

The claim is an outright lie.  In late September I
interviewed the project manager of the Swindon
experiment (Rob Jameson) and was told without
equivocation that Mondex uses a full audit trail of all
transactions. Jameson told me all retailers have a
card linked record of all transactions which are
available to the bank.  This directly contradicts the
publicity.  Mondex, in fact, uses the same audit trail
systems as any other card system. This is, to my
knowledge, the first time Mondex has revealed this
dimension of its system.<p>

Mondex consistently makes its claim of being privacy
friendly.  Page 15 of the Mondex Media Pack (August
1994) states the cards are as anonymous as cash.
In defence of its tactics, Mondex might well argue
that the cards are transferable, and thus the audit
trail cannot technically link a transaction to an
identified individual in, say, the way a credit card
could (the credit card requires a signature). This
justification is largely irrelevant. I believe Mondex
has conducted research which shows that almost
one hundred per cent of transactions are conducted
by the owner of the card.<p>

I believe Mondex is in clear breach of the Trade
Descriptions Act.  It has willfully and intentionally set
out to mislead the public. I believe the case warrants
prosecution. Mondex must either cease describing
their product as anonymous and cash like, or it
must remove all transaction recording machinery at
point of sale.<p>

Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further
information.<p>

Yours sincerely<p>
