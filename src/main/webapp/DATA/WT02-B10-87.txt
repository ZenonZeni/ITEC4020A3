Aquatech, a U.S.-based environmental technology development firm, has developed and successfully demonstrated a proprietary process for treating saline waste water from the oil, gas, and coal mining operations. The process enables mine operators to achieve compliance with environmental regulations and to recover clean water for use in agricultural or industrial processes.<P>

Waste water from energy resource production operations is highly saline and contaminated with other environmentally regulated compounds. Its discharge into streams, rivers, and other natural bodies of water results in severe water quality degradation and ecosystem destruction, including death of vegetation and fish. Energy and mineral producers are under increasing pressure to treat and dispose of these effluents to comply with national and international environmental mandates and to reduce their pollution liability exposure. This is especially true in areas of Central Europe where environmental degradation has reached unsustainable levels.<P>

To date, private investors and the U.S. Department of Energy have invested more than $3 million in the development and commercial demonstration of the Aquatech process. Aquatech is under contract to deliver equipment and technical services for a long-term demonstration of the process at Morcinek Mines, Silesia, Poland. This is part of a research and demonstration program funded jointly by Aquatech, the U.S. Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, the Polish Ecofund and the Polish National Fund for the Environment.<P>

The demonstration project, as well as the further application of the process to mines throughout Poland and other parts of Central Europe, uses coalbed methane that is currently vented into the atmosphere, to fuel the process. This use of coalbed methane is not only cost-effective, but also reduces greenhouse gas emission, thereby helping to fulfill the goals of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, ratified by the U.S. and more than 100 other countries.<P>

Aquatech's proprietary process offers the following direct benefits to the user:<P>

<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>Elimination of pollution liabilities resulting from new and additional contamination of water resources by saline discharges from mining operations.
<LI>Reclamation of a substantial portion of the effluent stream as fresh water for agricultural or industrial uses.
<LI>Environmental, water resource and fishery benefits resulting from the prevention of damage from saline discharge that destroys water resources and ecosystems.
<LI>Compliance with national environmental regulations designed to eliminate waste water discharges and pollution fines.
<LI>Support of international treaty obligations regarding water pollution and global climate change.
</UL>
Aquatech  has focused its initial commercial efforts on the multi-billion dollar emerging market in Poland and neighboring countries in Central Europe. Poland  has recently committed to a $9 billion program to improve its environmental infrastructure. Water discharges from mining activities constitute the single largest source of water pollution in Poland. The extension of the Polish mine project beyond the demonstration phase has the support of the Polish government, the Polish Ecofund and the Polish National Fund for the Environment and the World Business Counsel for Sustainable Development.<P>
