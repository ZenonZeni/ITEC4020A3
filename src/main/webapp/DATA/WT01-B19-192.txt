<p align="center"><b>USA Today Endorses Access To Medical
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 18, 1996, Arlington, VA:</b>&nbsp; <i>USA
Today</i>, the nation's most widely read daily newspaper, has
endorsed access to medical marijuana.&nbsp; The endorsement
stemmed from a <i>USA Today</i> editorial entitled
&quot;Anti-drug focus keeps marijuana from the ill&quot; and came
just two days after the newspaper featured a major article on a
California ballot initiative that would allow seriously ill patients
to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent with a doctor's
recommendation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling marijuana &quot;one of the least toxic medical compounds
in the world,&quot; the editorial cited both marijuana's relative
safety when compared to other legal drugs and medicines and
decades of scientific and anecdotal research maintaining its
medical efficacy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is entirely possible to fight the drug war without
harming innocent civilians in the process,&quot; concluded the <i>USA
Today</i>. &quot;But lawmakers must be careful to choose the
right battles.&nbsp; Therapeutic marijuana isn't one of
them.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statements made by <i>USA Today</i> in support of
medical access to therapeutic marijuana should have a positive
impact on America's views toward this issue and may translate
into a significant number of votes among California citizens in
favor of the Medical Marijuana Initiative,&quot; stated NORML
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Places Advertising Billboards
On Buses</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 11, 1996, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Several buses of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
will start promoting marijuana law reform thanks to the work of
dedicated local activists.&nbsp; After a year long struggle, the
Northcoast NORML chapter has paid for a three month advertising campaign
to run on the inside and outside of RTA buses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML first approached the RTA with their advertising
campaign in 1995 at which time the RTA denied the chapter's
request because they claimed the public service announcements
would promote the illegal use of marijuana.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML refused to accept the RTA's reasoning and brought the issue
to the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of
Ohio.&nbsp; After several correspondences between the ACLU and
RTA's legal staff, the RTA conceded that NORML's ad was not
promoting marijuana use and was political in nature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Northcoast NORML president John Hartman, the
chapter's billboards carry two basic messages.&nbsp; The
announcement appearing on the tailgate of buses emphasizes the 10 million-plus
marijuana arrests that have occurred since 1965 while the
billboard displayed on the inside reads: &quot;If you don't care
about the people sent to prison for smoking marijuana, at least consider
who gets released to make room for them.&quot;&nbsp; Hartman adds
that the RTA will soon begin displaying prohibitionist billboards
to counter Northcoast NORML's message. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML's billboards began running on area buses this
week. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Man Sentenced To Probation<br>
After Killing Individual He Suspected Sold His Son Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Hartsville, TN:</b>&nbsp; A father
was given three year's probation after pleading guilty to killing
the man he suspected of selling marijuana to his teenage
son.&nbsp; The defendant, Dennis Denham, had been indicted for
second degree murder. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Emotions ran high for participants on both sides of the
case.&nbsp; At one point, the shooting victim's mother told the
court that the defendant could see his children, but added that,
&quot;[She has] to go to the cemetery to see [hers.]&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Denham apparently blamed the man for injuries his son sustained
in an auto accident while allegedly driving under the influence
of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Have we demonized marijuana consumers in this country to
such a point that we allow citizens to murder them and get away
with it?&quot; questioned <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Law That Allows Citizens To Sue Drug Dealers
For Damages<br>
Moves Forward In California</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California state Senate has unanimously approved a sweeping bill
(S.B. 1754) that would allow private parties to sue drug dealers
for damages even if the defendant had nothing to do with the
specific drugs or incident that caused the damage. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the Drug Dealer Liability Act, introduced by Sen. Charles
Calderon (D-Whittier) and co-sponsored by Attorney General Dan
Lungren, drug dealers could be sued in civil court for any damages
caused by the same kind of drug elsewhere in the same city or
county, regardless of who actually furnished it, using a radical,
new &quot;market participation&quot; liability doctrine.&nbsp;
For example, under the provisions of a similar law in Michigan,
dealers who can be shown to have sold 650 grams of a controlled
substance are liable for injuries throughout the state, while
those who sold less than 50 grams can be held liable for injuries
in the county where the sales occurred. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Those allowed to sue under the California proposal would include:
parents or family members of users; employers of users; medical
facilities, insurers, or other institutions that fund drug treatment
programs; individuals exposed in utero to an illegal substance;
and persons injured as a result of the willful, reckless, or
negligent actions of an individual substance user. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a way of fighting [drug dealers] by hitting them right
in the pocket,&quot; said actor Carroll O'Connor, who has lobbied
for the measure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defendants could be sued if they (1) provided the drug or (2) had
&quot;as a pattern&quot; participated in the market for that drug
within the same city or county.&nbsp; The latter is defined to
mean that they provided the same illicit drug on at least two
instances, with at least one conviction.&nbsp; Cultivation of under
25 marijuana plants would not count as an offense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;When is enough enough?&quot; asked Mark Kappelhoff,
legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
in Washington, D.C., in a recent <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
article.&nbsp; Kappelhoff maintained that adding civil judgments
to criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture could be tantamount
to constitutionally cruel or unusual punishment or double
jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California state assembly is expected to approve the measure
by the end of August. <br>

<p align="center"><b>PBS Special To Focus On Human Rights
Violations And The Drug War</b> </p>
