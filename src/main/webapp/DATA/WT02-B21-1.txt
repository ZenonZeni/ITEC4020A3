<b>Improving the Lives of Children: An SED Primary Prevention Project</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F40012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will implement and assess interventions enabling schools to
provide
positively oriented instruction, curricula, and support services needed to prevent
students
receiving special education for emotional and behavioral problems from developing
serious
emotional disturbance (SED).<P>

METHOD:  The project will proceed over a 4-year period in three phases.  During
Phase 1
intervention refinement project staff will identify concerns and form working intervention
groups,
and identify and develop instrumentation and specific tracking procedures for target
students.  To
develop tracking procedures, staff will define students at risk for SED and describe a
set of
identifying predictors.  Staff will also collect baseline data for comparison groups. 
Phase 2
intervention implementation will focus on full implementation of various
multienvironment
interventions and on compiled data related to them.  Intervention efforts will include
screening
and identification of target groups including those currently receiving special education
services
(N=100) and students identified as at risk (N=100).  These students will come from
backgrounds
of poverty, live in violent neighborhoods, are likely to drop out of school, or are likely to
develop
high rates of school recorded behavior problems.  Two hours of observation will be
allotted for
each participating student, through four 30-minute periods.  In Phase 3 final follow-up
and
dissemination project staff will complete evaluation, report data relevant to the change
process,
pursue ways to continue some interventions that require financial resources beyond
what schools
can provide, and develop easy-to-read manuals on guidelines and strategies for
implementing
various interventions in other elementary schools to prevent SED among students with
emotional
and social problems. Additional training will be implemented for school personnel,
community
agency personnel, family members, and others to broaden project impact.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in an increase in the number of
least
restrictive environments, and in specific documents usable by policy makers.  This
project will
also improve prevention of SED among youth.<P>

<b>Project EXCELLENCE: Exceptional Children Enrolled  in the Least-Restrictive
Learning
Environments Made Notably Cost-Effective</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237B20025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project addresses the problem of mainstreaming for children and
youth with
emotional or behavioral disorders by: (1) obtaining waivers for the finance structure and
establishing alternative educational programs; and (2) developing, implementing, and
monitoring
individual student transition plans to least restrictive community environments during
the
implementation phase.<P>

METHOD:  A model planning process will be created, including the development of
alternative
funding patterns to encourage least restrictive environment placement, development of
a
transition
planning process, and creation of a transition planning document.  Four separate
record-keeping
documents will be maintained to grant administration, formative process assessment,
summative
objective evaluation, and individual student data.  Staff will design appropriate
interventions,
primarily ecological/behavioral, at the hospital, at participating schools, and in receiving
communities.  Appropriate Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) will be generated for
each
student, and parents and families will be involved in both the planning and
implementation of the
project.<P> 

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Written products documenting project activities and
results will
include a formal evaluation report, a more user-friendly replication guide, and articles by
project
staff to be submitted for publication in professional journals. Findings will also be
presented at
least one state-wide or national conference.<P>

<b>Investigation of the Institution-to-Community Transition Experiences of Adolescents
with
Emotional and Behavioral Disorders</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30049 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a follow-along investigation of the
institution-to-community
transition of adolescents with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), who have
been
incarcerated for their extreme antisocial behaviors.<P>

METHOD:  Data on roughly 300 to 400 adolescents with EBD will be gathered on their
release
from institutional facilities in the state of Oregon.  At referral, demographic, SES, level of
service,
and social skill rating forms will be completed on each person.  Between 3 and 9
interviews will
be administered to each individual by telephone at 6-month intervals.  Interview
questions will
pertain to subjects' vocational, educational, social, independent living, and general
community
adjustment.  Similar interviews will be administered to subjects' parent/guardian and
probation/parole officers.  Employment data will also be checked yearly with a
state-wide
database.  Data will then be examined using logistic regression techniques and LISREL
procedures to examine relationships among multiple predictor and outcome
constructs.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will establish baseline data on the adjustment
of
individuals exiting these institutions.  The participation of key state level administrators
is
expected to substantially augment dissemination plans.  By disseminating information
on the
findings and procedures employed in this project, the project hopes to instigate similar
projects in
other regions to improve the adjustment and quality of life among this population.<P>

<b>Life On The Outs - Qualitative Investigation of   Resilience</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50150 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/00<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct an intensive qualitative investigation of the
institution-to-community transition of adolescents with emotional and behavioral
disorders who
have been incarcerated in the two most secure juvenile correctional facilities in
Oregon.<P>

METHOD:  The research will seek to define the variables and events that differentiate
those
persons who leave the facilities and are successful in their transition efforts versus
those who are
not successful.  This process will contribute to the development and refinement of a
grounded
theory on resilience and its meaning in the transition experiences of this population. 
The project
will dovetail with and parallel a quantitative study already in process in which staff are
gathering
extensive data on the demographic characteristics and institutional and transitional
experiences
of
400-500 male and female adolescents from these facilities.  In Phase 1, staff will
investigate
childhood and adolescent experiences which contribute to resiliency by conducting a
life history
study of a sample of successful (employed, in school, no re-arrests) and unsuccessful
participants
from the quantitative project who have been out for 1 to 2 years already.  Throughout
the five
project years staff will continue with longitudinal investigations of their lives in the
community,
describing and contrasting the characteristics, experiences, and supports of those who
do or do
not succeed in transitioning into community life.  Phase 2 will be a focused exploration
of
specific
factors contributing to resilience, based on interviews with selected informants.  In
Phase 3, staff
will conduct systematic member checks to test the validity of theories of resilience with
respondents, interviewees, and knowledgeable others.  In Phase 4, staff will prepare
the study
products for dissemination.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Planned products include: a holistic model of the
construct of
resilience, based on the experiences and perspectives of participants themselves; and
a collection
of case studies illustrating the model and outlining the life histories of participants. 
Extensive
efforts will be made to disseminate results and products to other professionals, sites,
parents, and
consumer groups both regionally and nationally.<P>

<b>Project SERVE: Support for the Emotional,Residential, Vocational, and Educational
Needs
of Adolescents with EBD</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F50023 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will provide vocational services and service management to
adolescents
with emotional and behavioral problems, and will examine the effects of these
interventions on
both in-project and post-project experiences and outcomes among participants.<P>

METHOD:  Participating adolescents will be referred to the project and assigned a
Service
Coordination Specialist, who will work in conjunction with the adolescents and his/her
family to
plan and implement these services.  After exiting the school setting, services will be
arranged to
continue through a support network from different community agencies (including
vocational
rehabilitation, Job Training Partnerships, and Social Security offices).  A comprehensive
data
collection systems will be used to describe empirically the student and his or her
presenting
behaviors and the types and intensity of services that are provided to each participant.
To
examine
post-project impact of the services, participants will be tracked through individual
interviews and
review of extant state-level data sets on criminal and employment activities to profile
their
transition experiences.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities and projects will include
presentations
at
professional conferences, articles for submission to professional journals, and a project
newsletter
for quarterly distribution to education and human services agencies as well as parents,
teachers
and other stakeholders.  Upon the project's completion a monograph describing the
data
collection procedures, results, and service delivery recommendations will be
developed.<P>

<b>Designing Educational Support Teams through Interagency Networks for Youth with
Serious
Emotional Disturbance (DESTINY-SED)</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D30012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will provide training and support for families and professionals
in the
fields of education, social work, and mental health to improve services for children and
youth
with
serious emotional disturbances.<P>

METHOD:  In each of six communities, a research team from the Institute on Emotional
Disabilities will work with the middle schools and the local Child and Adolescent Service
Systems
Program (CASSP) teams to collaboratively identify staff development needs.  Staff
development
objectives will be phrased in terms of knowledge, skills, and strategies that project
participants
will be expected to use in their practice with professionals, students, and families. 
Particular
objectives will focus on the areas of collaboration among project participants and on
ways to
apply knowledge, skills, and strategies.  Student progress will be closely monitored
through data
on school attendance and involvement, social competence, and achievement, as well
by project
staff and teacher rating scales, in-school record reviews, and responses from
community agencies
and parents.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Staff development is expected to motivate and empower
participants to accomplish new goals in the workplace, and renew their commitment to
achieve
desirable outcomes for youth with serious emotional disturbances.  By focusing on
teachers and
students in the middle school years, the project intends to impact on students' social
and
academic
involvement in school and better prepare students for high school completion,
vocational
placements, and entry into productive adult living.<P>

<b>School Outcomes and Community Benefits for Minority Youth With Serious
Emotional
Disturbances: Synthesizing Research and Literature to Devise Practical Strategies for
Families
and Professionals</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will systematically review and synthesize key research findings
and
literature from related fields and communicate to schools and families what works,
rather than to
document past failures of the system, focusing on improvement of practice in the
schools in
relationship to school success and postschool benefits.<P>

METHOD:  The project will systematically synthesize literature and research respective
to needs,
characteristics, treatments and alternatives as they promote or inhibit successful
benefits and
outcomes among youth with serious emotional disturbances or emotional problems. 
These
syntheses will focus on: (1) individuals with emotional disabilities from minority
backgrounds;
(2)
optimal educational outcomes and social benefits; and (3) valid strategies that
professionals may
use to improve benefits and outcomes.  Staff members will identify strategies that
professionals
can use to improve the benefits and community outcomes for youth from minority
backgrounds
with behavioral disorders, and will identify strategies that families of youth with
behavioral
disorders can use to improve school participation and community outcomes for these
children
and
young adults.  Staff will achieve these objectives by pursuing a finite series of relevant
hypotheses
identified by a Constituency Resource Committee.  The literature base included to test
each
hypothesis will be evaluated using a Systematic Integrative Review, applying multiple
approaches
to synthesize and integrate quantitative, qualitative, and expository literature.  The
review will
permit comparison and compression of information drawn from published
research-based,
theory-based, practice-based, and case studies, and from literature available through
"fugitive
sources." Each potential literature source will be examined in terms of problem
formulation, the
quality and reliability of data or evidence collected, it's evaluation of the validity of
evidence
yielded, the replicability of interpretations of findings, the accuracy of interpretation, and
the
quality of presentation of findings.  The synthesized data will form the basis for
conclusions and
recommendations about needs, characteristics, benefits, outcomes, and justification for
recommending the use of potential strategies by professionals and families.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The review will yield a database comprised of a set of
synthesized
data elements relevant to each hypothesis which others may use to replicate both the
procedures
of the research and the viability of conclusions reached from the synthesis.<P>

and Their
Families</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237B20014 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will bring together individuals and organizations to plan,
develop, and
provide case management and professional services to children and youth with serious
emotional
disturbances (SED).<P>

METHOD:  In Phase I, the project will design and assess a comprehensive system of
education
and care.  Activities will include: (1) development of an interagency collaboration model
comprised of representatives from parents and the primary educational, social and
mental health
agencies in the community; (2) agreement on which students will be served, the
principles of
care,
and written joint agreements; (3) the implementation of a comprehensive needs
assessment of
children, family, and service providers and (4) the development of a plan of action to
design a
comprehensive system.  In Phase II, the system will be implemented and evaluated. 
The system
will be based on the principles of individualized care which emphasize unconditional
care,
intensive case management, wrap-around services, family involvement, and cultural
competence. 
The evaluation model will gather information in the areas of child status, family
involvement,
interagency collaboration, community-based services and demographic information.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A series of working papers will be developed which will
include
research reports, position papers, and other descriptions of products or activities carried
out by
staff members.  While these papers will be published eventually, they will initially be
disseminated
to professionals working with students with serious emotional disturbance.  Staff will
present
reports on project activities and findings at appropriate professional meetings.  Reports
of the
implementation and results of each evaluation component will be written and published
in
manual
style at the conclusion of the project.  These manuals will be disseminated to persons
on the
mailing list who request them.<P>

<b>Promoting Attention, Literacy, and Socialization (PALS) among Students with
Emotional/Behavioral Disorders </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will use Adaptive Peer Tutoring to enhance the task
engagement,
reading achievement, prosocial behavior and quality of generalized peer interactions,
social
status,
and degree of inclusion in mainstream settings for students with emotional/behavioral
disorders
(EBD). <P>

METHOD:  During the first year of this 3-year project, PALS staff will implement,
formatively
evaluate, and modify existing Adaptive Peer Tutoring methods to maximize their
feasibility and
efficacy for students with EBD.  In Year 2, staff will develop additional training
procedures
designed to extend participating students' capacity to explain difficult materials to peers
and to
develop prosocial interaction styles.  At this time, staff will also examine the added
value of this
component to existing Adaptive Peer Tutoring methods.  In Year 3, project staff will
develop
Adaptive Peer Tutoring further and explore its efficacy for helping students with EBD
make
successful adjustments to general education reading classes.  Staff members will
contrast typical
reintegration methods to those in which Adaptive Peer Tutoring is implemented in both
special
and regular education settings to facilitate the mainstreaming effort.  During each
project year,
participating teachers (N=20) of students with EBD will implement treatments with all
students
in
their classrooms and will identify study participants (N=120).  Classroom observations
during
Adaptive Peer Tutoring will be conducted to assess the fidelity of treatment.  Direct
observation
methodology will be employed during reading instruction to index task engagement and
prosocial
interactions.  Videotapes of generalization sessions will be coded to evaluate quality of
peer
interactions.  Staff will also use pre/post individual multidimensional assessments, peer
sociometric ratings, and questionnaires to monitor levels of student interaction and
achievement.
<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in modified Adaptive Peer Tutoring
methods that specifically maximize benefits and feasibility for students with EBD,
extended
Adaptive Peer Tutoring procedures designed to help students with EBD make
successful
transitions to general education, and a teacher training manual and video explaining the
implementation of these enhanced Adaptive Peer Tutoring methods with students with
EBD in
both special and mainstream reading instruction classes. <P>

including instruction in prosocial behaviors, training in problem solving, incidental
teaching, and
reinforcement procedures for generalization of skill usage; and (2) peer tutoring in
reading and
comprehension skills.  The home-based component will include: (1) parent-child
activities and
monitoring schedules for increasing positive parent-child interaction and supervision;
and (2)
parent-led play/recreation groups for reinforcement of prosocial skills.  The third level
prevention
component will provide systematic functional assessment and analysis of environments
to
determine conditions maintaining resistant behaviors with consequent intervention for
behavioral
improvement, as well as liaison work with community-based agencies to facilitate family
services. 
The investigation will include three elementary school sites in an intensive
quality-controlled
program for 36 to 45 children, with a control group. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Expected outcomes include increased, positive adult and

<b>World of Difference: A Culturally-Competent Demonstration Model to Improve
Services for
Students with Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) and to Develop Prevention
Services for
Students with Emotional and Behavioral Problems </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237G50018 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate a collaborative
model of
culturally competent intervention and prevention services designed to address the
current gaps in
service delivery to students at risk and students with serious emotional disturbance
(SED). <P>

METHOD:  The project will establish four model classroom sites of students at risk of
having
SED and students with SED where the most successful collaborations among teachers,
paraprofessionals, mental health providers, students, and family members would be
replicated. 
Two classes will consist of approximately twelve 3rd - 5th grade Hispanic students
classified as
learning disabled and at risk for serious emotional disturbances.  The other two classes
will
consist
of approximately ten predominantly African-American 3rd-5th grade students already
classified
as
SED.  Tutors from San Francisco State University's Special Education Department
Minority
Outreach Program will provide tutoring, encouragement, support and mentoring to
students. 
Teachers, paraprofessionals, and tutor/mentors will receive intensive training and
resource
materials regarding the use of culturally competent instructional strategies and
curricula, as well
as training in use of student-centered instructional strategies designed to capitalize on
students'
diversity and individual strengths.  Family members will be provided with information
and
training
regarding mental health issues, learning disabilities and serious emotional
disturbances,
instructional practices, and ways in which families can provide emotional and academic
support
to
their children.  Onsite service and after-school consultant time will also be increased.  
<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project results will be disseminated to family members at
community meetings, while dissemination to mental health providers will take place in
the form
of
workshops to be coordinated with the professional development personnel of each
department. 
Further dissemination will be filtered through the school district-wide professional
development
system and channeled through collaborating institutions to reach beyond the immediate
target
population.<P>

<b>Qualitative Investigation of Effective Service Coordination for Children and Youth
with
Emotional and Behavioral Disorders </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50053 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  The project will examine parent perspectives on what constitutes effective
service
coordination.  Investigators will explore what happens for individual children and their
families
as
a result of effective service coordination that would not have occurred without such
support. <P>

METHOD:  Phase 1 of the project will include the facilitation of a focus group of 10 to
12
parents who are coordinators of local family support groups located throughout the
state.  Results
of the focus group will be used to develop the next phase of data collection.  Phase 2
will consist
of in-depth semi-structured interviews with 8 to 12 parents who have children with
emotional or
behavioral disorders.  Each parent will nominate the professional they perceive as
being the most
helpful in providing service coordination, after which each of these professionals will be
interviewed by research staff.  The coding of interview transcripts, comparisons of
parent and
professional perceptions, and identification of categorical systems each parent and
child is
involved in will be used to indicate which school and agency documents to review. 
Data
analysis
will proceed concurrently with data collection, and will be used to influence future data
collection. 
Phase 3 will consist of member checks to test the validity of emerging theories of
effective
service
coordination.  Phase 4 will consist of the preparation and dissemination of project
findings. 
Emerging theories of effective service coordination will be documented in this stage.
<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings will be disseminated in the form of presentations
at
conferences and submission of articles to professional journals.  Dissemination will take
place
across the disciplines of education, social services, juvenile justice, and child and
adolescent
mental health. <P>

<b>Project SUCCESS: Preventing the Development of SED Among Children with
Emotional
and Behavioral Problems </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F40022 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to conduct research into the prevention of
the
development of Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) in elementary school students
with
behavioral and emotional problems through intervention based on multidisciplinary
literature.
<P>
METHOD:  In the first of 4 project years, staff will finalize the case study "best
practices" theory
and scenario, develop the case study protocol and pilot the protocol.  The pilot test will
include
interviews with kindergarten teachers and the review of specific documents for
relevance.  Staff
will then plan and conduct inservice training for participating teachers and other school
personnel. 
During this year, staff will also screen students in each participating school, collect and
analyze
data, evaluate and manage the project, and work to collaborate with other SED
projects.  During
the following 3 project years, staff will conduct assessments of family needs and
strengths of
families of at-risk children, and will conduct functional assessments through interviews. 
Staff
will
ask teachers for their perceptions of the environmental conditions under which at-risk
children in
their classes display desirable or undesirable behaviors.  Interviewed teachers will
begin testing
hypotheses developed on the bases of functional assessment interviews.  Staff will then
develop
Family Service Plans (FSPs), and implement the educational child-centered
components and the
family-focused components.  Once FSPs have been implemented, staff will collect and
analyze
case study data using the case study protocol developed in Year 1, and analyze school
records/accumulative folders for at-risk children in grades 1 and 2.  Staff will also survey
comparison schools about identification of SED in 1st and 2nd grade children, and will
collect
data on personal and social attributes on the Student Self-Concept Scale (SSCS),
Social Skills
Rating System (SSRS), Classroom Behavior Inventory (CBI), and peer ratings and
nominations
(PRN).  Finally, staff will disseminate results, and work further to collaborate with other
Office
of
Special Education (OSEP) projects. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project SUCCESS will result in a validated model for: (1)
identifying students with such serious emotional and behavioral problems that they are
at risk for
SED; (2) conducting functional assessments of at-risk children; (3) developing
classroom
interventions; (4) coordinating multiple services based on family strengths/needs; and
(5)
ensuring
the delivery of culturally competent services to students and their families.<P>

<b>Developing Interagency Collaboration Skills for Transition of SED Students to Less
Restrictive Environments </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D20006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/04/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  1/03/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate the
effects of a
training program to develop knowledge, skills and strategies for collaboration between
education
and social service personnel in the transition of 16 students with serious emotional
disturbance
(SED) students to less restrictive educational settings. <P>

METHOD:  A competency-based training program will be developed and implemented
with 20
regular education, special education, related services, and social services personnel. 
During each
training session, material and concepts will be illustrated with videotaped vignettes,
practice
exercises will be presented for role playing, and participants will view video playbacks
of
examples of their positive performance.  The program will then evaluate the
effectiveness of
these
staff development methods in promoting acquisition of collaboration skills and the
generalization
of those skills during interagency team meetings to coordinate services for the transition
of
students with SED.  In addition, the program will assess outcomes of collaboration on
improved
services and on professionals' motivation and sense of empowerment. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to directly providing services to students with
SED,
the program will contribute to a greater understanding of the knowledge, skills, and
strategies
underlying effective collaboration.  Project findings will be disseminated via reports to
consumer
groups, publication of articles and a multimedia training package, and a conference
sponsored by
the Devereux Foundation.<P>

<b>Collaborative Responsibility Empowering School Teams (CREST) </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D30069 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/10/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will test the value of the CREST model as an effective
school-based
approach to training school and community staff to meet the needs of students with
serious
emotional disturbance (SED) and behavior disorders.<P>

METHOD:  The CREST Project is a comprehensive 3-year program to support the total
school
staff of 21 schools in developing and using knowledge and skills to respond to all
students in a
constant and predictable manner.  The purpose of the project is to enhance and
promote students'
growth and well-being and allow students with serious emotional and behavior
problems to
remain in their community schools.  Major training components support school staff in
using
community and school resources in the following fields of focus: (1) developing and
implementing
school-wide discipline policies and procedures; (2) teaching and maintaining positive
classroom
behavior and social skills; (3) designing, implementing and evaluating interventions for
students
with SED; (4) developing ongoing support systems for the school model to ensure
refinement
and
maintenance as school ecology changes. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will use descriptive methods to document the
development of each school's CREST program as they refine and maintain the model
over time. 
These descriptions will then provide the basis for further research into the factors that
help
schools sustain the ability to meet the needs of students with a wide range of
behavioral and
emotional differences. <P>

<b>Project Community Approach to Improving Child Success (Project CAICS) </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237G50045 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will create a comprehensive program to address the problem
of unequal
distribution of children with behavior problems or serious emotional disturbance (SED)
to
special
education classes through a combination of models based on systems theory. <P>

METHOD:  Project CAICS will work with three groups of students: (1) those students at
any
grade or level who are classified as seriously emotionally disturbed based upon a
thorough Child
Study Team assessment; (2) those students identified by individual schools in grades
K-8 as part
of their ongoing search for improved effectiveness with all children; and (3) those
students
whose
background suggests they are at risk of developing SED as they progress through
school.  The
project will intervene with these students by assisting regular education teachers to
adopt specific
techniques and strategies, assisting building administrators in addressing school
environmental
problems that help to trigger negative behaviors, and training staff in basic techniques
to reduce
cross-cultural misunderstandings.  The project will also work with pre-high school
programs to
institute curricular and instructional approaches to teaching all students the skills
necessary to
succeed in school.  The community will support this approach by coordinating and
expanding
community activities which foster the development of peaceful and cooperative conflict
resolution
skills.  The community and the school will jointly develop the details of project actions
through a
set of advisory panels.  Each participating teacher will receive staff development and
training
over
an eight-month period to reinforce learning of both recommended techniques and their
underlying
philosophy.  This component will directly seek to reform the institutional culture of
participating
schools relative to the population of students whose behavior has been a major
concern for years.
<P> 

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the project's conclusion, staff expect to find fewer
students
classified as SED due to emotional and behavior reasons which are not deeply rooted
in factors
beyond the control of the family.  This will translate to less restrictive learning
environments for
more students, fewer discipline problems in the schools, and a lower operating cost for
special
education programs. <P>

<b>Comparing Experiential Inservice and On-site Consultation to Increase Inclusionary
Practices for Students with SED</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D30045 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to compare two unique approaches to
increasing the
skills and applications of interventions for effective inclusion of students with serious
emotional
disturbance (SED) in regular education classrooms. <P>

METHOD:  In this 3-year study, personnel from 24 school districts will be trained
through a
combination of experiential inservice training and on-site consultative support provided
by staff
from an approved private school for children with SED.  Participating school districts will
be
required to identify teams of three district personnel including a regular education
teacher,
special
education teacher, and related services personnel.  Districts will be randomly assigned
to one of
three conditions (Experiential Inservice/Immediate Consultation; Experiential
Inservice/Delayed
Consultation; and Wait-List Control Group.)  Outcomes measures repeated at specific
points of
the study will include quantitative and qualitative measures of content and process. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of this project are expected to provide empirical
examinations of training methods that may be possible for increased collaboration
between other
approved private schools and public school districts. Additionally, the project should
provide
careful analysis of the potential impact of such training methods on the knowledge,
skills, and
attitudes of school personnel working within regular education settings.<P>

<b>Children and Youth at Risk of Developing Serious Emotional Disturbance                  
       
(Project Impact) </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237G50029 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will provide a community-based program focused on
preventing and
treating children with serious emotional disturbance (SED) in a culturally competent
manner,
using families as a key component. <P>

METHOD:  Project Impact will target approximately 50 predominantly African-American
students, some of whom are in special education classes, between the ages of 12 and
15, who are
exhibiting dysfunctional behaviors and are considered to have SED or are at risk for
SED. 
During
the planning phase, needs and strengths will be determined through the use of
community forums
involving students, families, service providers, community educators, leaders, and
businesses,
and
by surveying families and students regarding what they view as their own most
important needs. 
Project staff will identify community resources and individuals that are willing and able
to
provide
services to children with SED and their families.  Teachers and project staff will be
provided
with
training and staff development focusing on cultural sensitivity, and culturally competent
assessment instruments will be developed to help evaluate children showing signs of
SED and
their families.  In order to increase access to and utilization of mental health services,
location of
services, service providers, services provided, service hours, and outreach to the
community by
providers will be closely examined.  Project staff will ensure that during initial meetings
with
children and families, service providers stress the role and importance of the family in
the design
and implementation of the services the child will receive.  Project Impact will train and
utilize
family advocates from the community to help families prepare for these initial meetings. 
Direct
service methods and interventions that are planned include: recognition of and
intervention in
social problems; group therapy; family-focused therapy; in-home services; crisis
intervention and
problem solving services; didactic and educational approaches; community-level
interactions;
and
appreciation and recognition of cultural issues and problems. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  By collaboratively creating and implementing culturally
competent services designed to prevent and treat SED in African-American children,
this project
will prevent future costs by enabling families to care for their children and access
appropriate
services, helping prevent and reduce out-of-home placement costs.  Through the
Easter Seals
network and the Wayne County Regional Educational Service Agency, staff will be able
to
actively disseminate project information using inservice training, newsletters, meetings,
and
other media.<P>

escape- and
avoidance-motivated behavior associated with teacher/student instructional
interactions; and (4)
identifying through direct observation teacher escape- and avoidance-motivated
behavior. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be disseminated through research
reports,
teacher guidelines, and conference presentations.  Anticipated findings will document
current
uses
of negative reinforcement within the instructional process and examine the potential of
negative
reinforcement in therapeutic applications. <P>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F50028 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will assist students in developing the interpersonal skills
necessary to
manage their own conflicts through a school-based conflict resolution/peer mediation
program
with community and family linkages. <P>

METHOD:  In the first year of the program, staff will work collaboratively with middle
school
professionals, parents, and community representatives to: (1) develop a curriculum; (2)
train
school professionals and students in the curriculum and its implementation; (3) access,
develop,
and validate data collection instruments; and (4) establish data collection programs. 
The conflict
resolution/peer mediation (CR/PM) program will also be piloted in this year.  During the
second
year, staff will fully implement the CR/PM program in two treatment schools and use
two
matched middle schools as delayed treatment or control, while also seeking
opportunities for
impact through parent and community groups.  In the third year, staff will fully
implement the
CR/PM program in the two delayed treatment schools and monitor the program in the
original
treatment schools as they assume full responsibility for its implementation, while
continuing
involvement in home and community-based settings.  During the fourth year of the
project, staff
will collect data in all four schools as the delayed treatment schools disengage from
project
personnel and continue to collect generalization data on all high school students who
graduated
from the four middle schools. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide a model for future research in the
area
by providing a theoretical base as a model, a validated curriculum and training protocol
for
teachers and student mediators, implementation protocols, validated data collection

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and demonstrate a model to recruit and train
natural
paraprofessional caregivers from the community to support teachers and parents in
creating
school and family environments that foster the psychosocial and intellectual
development of
Native Hawaiian students with or at risk for serious emotional disturbances (SED). <P>

METHOD:  Phase I of the process will involve building and maintaining a team of
stakeholders
with a common vision for a seamless system of culturally competent and
nondiscriminatory
services.  Team members will be recruited based on the criteria that they have strong
connections
to the Native Hawaiian community and have expressed a desire to help it address its'
problems. 
Phase II will employ a five-step framework to guide team members through review and
discrepancy analysis of desired and existing services: (1) team members will explore
and
determine outcomes expected of students following completion of their educational
programs;
(2)
team members will review educational and related services proven successful in
contributing to
these outcomes for minority group students; (3) team members will review current
practices with
a focus on their cultural competency and efficacy for Native Hawaiian students; (4)
team
members
will decide what current practices need to be improved, and how; and (5) team
members will
analyze how identified skills and behaviors can best be imparted to both professionals
and
natural
caregivers.  In Phase III, project staff will launch the implementation of innovations and
recommended improvements in training and services. It is anticipated that the resulting
natural
caregiver training program will last for 11 months with a strong emphasis on field
activities and
practice. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop curricula for natural caregivers
and
professionals; evaluation reports; a replication package; and journal articles and
conference
presentations.  Expected results for Native Hawaiian students with or at risk for SED
include a
decrease in proportions of students identified with SED, improved school attendance
and
performance, lower dropout rates, greater family involvement in service planning and
delivery,
increased satisfaction with services, decreases in inappropriate behaviors, improved
self-concept
and self-esteem, and higher rates of achieving IEP goals. <P>

<b>Multistage Assessment of Aggressive Behavior   </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N30025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will implement and evaluate a multistage, multivariate
assessment
protocol for identifying variables motivating aggressive behavior problems exhibited by
students
with serious emotional disturbances (SED). <P>

METHOD:  Key factors hypothesized as contributing to aggressive behavior will include:
a
social
skills deficit; positively or negatively reinforcing consequences; deficits in the cognitive
processing
of social stimuli; and environmental deficits.  The first project phase will implement the
multistage,
multivariate study involving 150 children with SED, incorporating screening measures
and a
comprehensive assessment of variables associated with aggressive behavior.  In
Phase 2 the
program will develop appropriate interventions based on the assessment information. 
These
interventions should yield information on the validity of assessment procedures and
shed light on
the interaction between key hypotheses of the functional model.  Four intervention
studies using
single-case methodology will be employed. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project methodology and results will be described in
papers for
publication to research-oriented journals.  Inservice workshops and consultation
activities will be
provided to promote dissemination to practitioners, as will a comprehensive report of
project
findings.<P>
