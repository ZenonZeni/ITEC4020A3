<B>Corporate Overview:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AGENE Research Institute Co., Ltd. (AGENE) is focusing on research of individual aging and cellular aging.<BR>
First we are investigating the cloning and the functions of Werner's syndrome genes and regulatory genes in cell proliferation.  Because these approaches will give the answers about the mechanism directing diseases resulting from aging. For example, aging specific diseases such as cataract, scleroderma, osteoporosis and arteriosclerosis are known to be rapidly induced in Werner's syndrome.<BR>
Second we are going to develop screening system of therapeutic drugs by some progeria animals developed by us and the assay system of aging genes expression, which will contribute the development for new therapeutics against aging associated diseases. The research period is 7 years and the research budget is 3.1 billion yen. In near future, employees will be 20.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>Research Plan:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Identification of aging genes from cells in Werner's syndrome patients. And analysis
of the genes function.<P>
2. Development of screeing system for drugs acting gene expression by aging genes derived from Werner's syndrome patients.<P>
3. Development of transgenic mice as progeria animal models induced by WS genes.<P>
4. Identification of suppressive genes in cell proliferation specifically associated aging cells in mammalian cell culture system. And analysis of the genes function. Development of screening system for drugs regulating suppressive function in such genes.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
