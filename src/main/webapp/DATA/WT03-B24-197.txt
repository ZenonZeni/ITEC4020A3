Subject: [bioglobe 18] Autoimmune disease mouse<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Ladies and Gentlemen:<BR>
A topic I introduce today is a success of some autoimmune disease mouse model. Dr.S.Sakaguchi in JRDC has established the mouse which had some kind of autoimmune disease sympton without CD4 and CD25 T cells. First, he found, in case CD4 and CD25 T cells were present on low level in mice, autoimmune disease was observed in high frequency. Second, CD4 and CD25 deficient T cells were injected into some mice without T cells, so that insulin dependent diabetes, thyroiditis, ovaritis, gastritis with pernicious anemia and arthritis were appeared, which was very similar to human autoimmune disease sympton. The other way, to this type of mice, CD4 and CD25 T cells were added, as a result, above sympton was disappeared. To make sure, he challenged to make mice without genes of CD4 and CD25. As expected, autoimmune disease was observed. The symptons of autoimmune diseases were a little different among different genetics mice. From these results, it is likely that some T cells in normal mice attack normal cells, and CD4 and CD25 T cells are usually suppressing above T cells to do it. This idea may be applied to prevention and therapy for autoimmune disease and cancer.<P>
