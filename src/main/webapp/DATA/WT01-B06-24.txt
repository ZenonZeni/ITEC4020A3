         <P>This includes all contract preparation; surrogate
         selection and monitoring; escrow account supervision; final
         preparation of the adoption decree, and any other legal work
         necessary to ensure that the adoption and/or termination of
         parental rights (if in the IVF/ET program) is successful. If
         legal work is necessary outside of Indiana, we may need an
         attorney in that state also represent you, in which case
         there might be additional legal fees.

         father; physical exam, HSG test (if necessary),
         insemination/embryo transfer, prenatal, delivery,
         post-partum care for the surrogate. Medical costs will vary
         greatly depending on how comprehensive the surrogate's
         health insurance policy is, or if she even has one. If she
         does not, you must purchase a policy for her. YOU ARE
         RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY EXPENSES NOT COVERED BY HER INSURANCE.

         <P>$2000 is about what SMI pays per woman made available to
         you. If for some reason you need to select a second
         surrogate, you are charged a second ad fee. If your
         surrogate does not pass the psychological testing and you
         select someone else, no additional fee is charged. Your
         account is also charged a one time fee of $500 which covers
         all phone calls (our toll free number is provided), regular
         mailings, faxes, etc.

         <P>These are the costs for the psychological evaluation and
         testing that the surrogate will undergo once she is
         selected. Also included is consultation during and after the
         pregnancy, if necessary.

         <P>This includes a $500 maternity clothing allowance; a
         $100,000 term life insurance policy which must be taken out
         on the surrogate (costs about $150); travel expenses to/from
         Indianapolis and/or Lexington, KY, for the AI program, or
         one of several different cities if in the IVF/ET program; a
         $100 daily allowance to compensate the surrogate for such
         things as lost wages, child care, meals, etc.; and
         attorney's fees for the surrogate's attorney ($300-$500).

         <P>Total approximate expenses, then, will be as little as
         about $15,000 (if the surrogate is not charging any fee and
         has insurance, which is very unlikely), or as much as
         $40,000 (is she is asking for $20,000 and does not have
         insurance, which also is unlikely). The average total cost,
         including everything above, is around $35,000. As a general
         guide, you can figure on at least $18,000 in expenses
         (includes everything except the surrogate's fee, and assumes
         a successful pregnancy after the first procedure). If you
         are participating in the IVF/ET program, the medical
         expenses will be significantly higher. Your insurance might
         cover some of these expenses, as well as some of my fees.
         These costs are intended as a guideline only. The actual
         costs may or may not exceed these figures. The legal fees,
         advertising costs, and psychological expenses are guaranteed
         not to increase once you have signed a contract, and if you
         withdraw from the program for any reason prior to a contract
         being signed with your surrogate, the legal fees are
         refunded in full.
