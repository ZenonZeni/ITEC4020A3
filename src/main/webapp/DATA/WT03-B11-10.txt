TRP'S FINALE: 34 PROJECTS WIN $137 MILLION FOR DUAL-USE R&D

By:
Bill Loveless

   The Technology Reinvestment Project closed out 1995 by announcing its
final batch of awards -- 34 projects in dual-use technology that will
receive $137.4 million in government funding.
   The selections, whose announcement had been delayed until Congress and
the Clinton administration agreed on an appropriations bill for the
Department of Defense in FY-96, were the last for TRP as it has been known
since 1993.
   (A list of the projects is on pages 7-8.)
The program is being overhauled by Defense to respond to congressional
demands that the Pentagon pay stricter attention to military needs in
providing support for technologies with both defense and commercial
applications.
   When FY-97 begins in October, the Pentagon plans to have in place a new
name and a new office for dual-use technology (FTR, 21 Dec, 3).
   A $195 million allocation for TRP in the Pentagon's FY-96 appropriation
is sufficient only to support the program's 131 current projects, including
the most recent ones. It does not allow for any solicitations.
   DOD plans to request $300 million for the program in FY-97, when the new
Joint Dual-Use Program Office opens. The new office will be operated for a
year by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has managed TRP since
its inception, and then by the Pentagon's defense research and engineering
office.
   The latest projects, whose selections were announced Dec. 22, were among
140 proposals received last summer by ARPA and fell into six ``focus
areas,'' including affordable advanced controls, biological sensing,
digital wireless communications, microelectromechanical systems and
non-warfare technologies.
   The $137.4 million in government funding that will support the new
projects for a year is less than half the estimated total cost of the
projects, the Pentagon said.
   The largest project -- in the affordable advanced controls category --
is a $48 million effort led by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, St. Louis, to
build a vehicle-management system.
   A number of federal laboratories are participants in the projects,
including the Naval Surface Warfare Centers in Bethesda, Md., and Dahlgren,
Va.; the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.; the Air
Force's Rome Laboratory, Rome, N.Y., and Wright Laboratory, Dayton, Ohio;
the Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Fort Belvoir,
Va.; the Army Weapons Sciences Directorate RD&E Center, Redstone Arsenal,
Ala.; and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.
   With the latest TRP awards, about $686 million in Pentagon funds have
been committed to the 131 projects.
   Meanwhile, Lee Buchanan, the TRP director, said this week that the
Department of Defense's plan to move the dual-use technology program from
ARPA to the Pentagon's defense research and engineering office (DDR&E)
responds to congressional perceptions that TRP has sometimes played down
military needs in choosing projects. The Joint Dual-Use Program Office will
also assure the Air Force, Army and Navy of involvement in project
selections and encourage them to integrate dual-use technologies in their
procurement decisions, he said in response to questions from Federal
Technology Report.
   ``The fact that the office is ultimately headed for DDR&E -- out of ARPA
-- reflects the complete emphasis on injecting the notion of dual use into
service procurement,'' he said. ``If this doesn't eventually end up
changing the way the services do business, it will not have been
successful.''
   Buchanan said it was ``not clear'' whether other federal agencies will
participate in future selections of dual-use technology projects, as they
have in the past.
   ``The emphasis is on DOD expenditures benefiting the military,'' he
said. ``Where that involves other agencies, and I imagine it can more than
not, we want them at the table. But there is no room for projects that
effectively transfer DOD money to civilian agencies.''

INEL PROPOSES FACILITY TO MIMIC EARTHQUAKES, OTHER DISASTERS

By:
David Kramer

   Idaho National Engineering Laboratory is proposing a new ``user
facility'' that would test the effects of earthquakes and other natural
disasters on new structural materials.
   The planned facility, which has already been dubbed the ``Advanced
Combined Effects Test Station,'' would exploit the peculiar geology at the
INEL site in southeast Idaho to enable scientists to generate earthquakes
comparable in intensity to the tremors that occurred in Kobe, Japan, and
North Ridge, Calif., in recent years.
   According to INEL Director Barton Krawetz, the region's fractured basalt
slope plain makes it seismically quiescent, and shock waves from the
manmade quakes would not propagate beyond the INEL site.
   In a recent interview, Krawetz said the ``Astrodome''-like facility is
expected to cost about $1 billion -- not much, he maintained, when measured
against the $180 billion in damage caused by the Kobe quake alone.
   Most of the funding would be derived not from INEL's parent, the
Department of Energy, but rather from other federal jurisdictions,
including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that respond to natural
disasters. Krawetz said he hoped that the facility can become a
``presidential initiative'' -- an elevated status that would vault it over
other projects competing for scarce federal funding.
   ``New structural materials other than iron and concrete can be advanced
only after full-scale testing. We think a user facility can appear here,''
Krawetz said.
   As with other user facilities located at DOE laboratories, ACETS'
customers would include both industry and university researchers. Krawetz
said he imagined it being used by the secondary insurance industry as well
as a company like Bechtel National Inc., which ``might want to bid on
building a new city in Saudi Arabia.''
   ACETS would also have a broad international appeal, and other nations,
including Japan, could be expected to contribute to its construction, he
said.
   The facility would be big enough to test structures hundreds of square
feet in size, Krawetz said. Apart from earthquakes, it would be capable of
producing winds as high as 200 miles per hour, as well as torrential rains.
While the area is arid, plenty of water is available from the Snake River
aquifer, he said.
   The facility would also help to re-establish INEL in the minds of the
research community, he noted.
   ``Some people think of us as a dump,'' Krawetz said, referring to INEL's
role as storage site for virtually all the types of radioactive wastes
roduced by DOE. ``We want to change the word on the street about this
place.''
Fees generated by ACETS also could help defray some of the fixed costs for
maintaining INEL from DOE's Environmental Management division, which is the
lab's landlord, he noted.

ATP, OTHER NIST PROGRAMS GET HIGH GRADES IN NEUTRAL REVIEW

By:
Bill Loveless

   An independent report card on the National Institute of Standards and
Technology released last week concludes that the Advanced Technology
Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership have enhanced NIST's
traditional work in standards and measures and not detracted from them, as
some critics of ATP and MEP have maintained.
   The annual assessment of NIST by a National Research Council board
suggests that eliminating ATP or MEP, which Congress established when it
broadened the institute's mandate in 1988, or tampering with NIST's
long-established programs, would result in more harm than good.
   ``Given the current political debate on the fate of the Department of
Commerce, and proposed legislation that would significantly reorganize NIST
and its functions, the board makes two observations,'' the report said.
``First, it is not possible for the nation to maintain government-certified
standards, weights and measures without the technical activities of the
NIST laboratories.''
   The report praised the ``cadre of highly qualified scientists and
engineers at NIST'' and described their work as ``absolutely essential'' to
maintaining the leading role of the U.S. standards and measurement system.
   ``Second,'' the report added, ``rather than detracting from the
traditional functions of NIST, the expanded role and new programs NIST has
assumed since 1988 have augmented that function in a positive manner. In
particular, the board has noted a synergy between the NIST laboratories and
the Advanced Technology Program, which has stimulated appropriate new
research directions in the laboratories and helped identify emerging needs
for standards and measurement services.''
   Although NIST contracts annually with NRC for the assessment, the
institute has no control over NRC's selection of board members nor over the
conclusions, a spokesman said this week. The latest review, which covers
FY-95, was conducted by 144 U.S. scientists and engineers from academic,
industrial and other research organizations.
   The board was chaired by Wilmer Bottoms of Patricof & Co.
   Although it credited NIST with assisting in the formation of high-tech
industries, the report acknowledged that specifically assessing the
institute's industrial impact is often difficult.
   ``Merely totaling the number of [cooperative r&d agreements] or industry
fellows is not an adequate measure of the impact the laboratories have on
U.S. industries,'' the report observed. ``Those counts do represent
valuable industrial cooperation on a case-by-case basis, but such numbers
could clearly be driven to excess if used as the only measure.''
   The report urged NIST to ``identify additional ways of measuring'' the
costs and benefits to the economy of the institute's programs.
   ``This effort is especially important as NIST's basic mission -- and the
funding provided by Congress to support it -- are under review,'' the
report said.
   NIST officials have admitted that their defense of ATP in the face of
attacks from the Republican-led Congress has been hampered because most of
the projects have not been completed yet and there is no generally accepted
way to measure their impact on the economy.
   Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have vowed to kill ATP this year,
although they relented in their opposition to MEP and agreed to legislation
providing funds for the program in FY-96 (FTR, 7 Dec, 1).
   Whether the NRC report will have any impact on NIST's critics in
Congress was uncertain, although the spokesman for the institute said NIST
considers the findings ``very useful'' in managing its labs and programs.
``It certainly doesn't hurt'' to have the NRC assessment, he added.
   The report followed by several weeks a broader review of federal science
and technology policy by the National Academy of Sciences that questioned
whether ATP would fulfill its goal of advancing technologies that the
private sector considers too risky to invest in (FTR, 7 Dec, 4). NRC is the
principal operating agency of the National Academy of Sciences.
   Participants in the earlier report, led by former NAS president Frank
Press, ``to our knowledge made no inquiries'' at NIST regarding ATP, the
institute's spokesman said. Those involved in the latest report, he added,
spent a considerable amount of time at NIST.

Standards and Technology Programs, Fiscal Year 1995,'' contact the National
Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave., NW, Box 285, Washington, DC 20055;

ARPA OFFERS TO ASSIST LAUNCH OF SHIPBUILDING R&D PROJECTS

By:
Neil MacDonald

   As part of its marine technology (``MARITECH'') effort to help develop a
U.S. shipbuilding sector capable of competitive commercial construction and
affordable naval shipbuilding, the Advanced Research Projects Agency is
seeking ideas from the private sector for advanced technology development
projects.
   Up to $20 million is expected to be available from ARPA for projects,
with selection taking place during the second quarter of FY-96. The
proposals must be cost-shared, with ARPA only investing a maximum of 50% of
the total project cost.
   Despite its long tradition of innovation, in recent years the U.S.
commercial shipbuilding sector has languished, tending to license designs
for new ship types from foreign yards rather than develop them itself.
Little dual-use technology transfer has been evident in the past between
America's naval ship construction programs and the commercial sector.
   MARITECH could change all of that, according to ARPA. Advanced hull
forms and innovative designs, such as high-speed catamarans, hybrid
surface-effect ships, and low-wash multihulls, often developed by
Australian and European shipyards, have been particularly evident in the
U.S. passenger ferry scene.
   Otherwise, the only real bright spots in the picture have come from
yards building vessels for riverboat casino use.
   Two technology-related thrusts embodied in the latest MARITECH
solicitation are aimed at remedying some of these woes by improving
shipyard practices in fundamental ways. For example, applying various new
technologies and processes to make their business tasks such as market
analysis, supplier relations, materiel procurement, cost estimating and
financial systems more efficient.
   ARPA sees a range of communication and electronic commerce technologies
allowing some of these tasks to be better executed and integrated.
   In addition, total process systems could be used to address the
development and demonstration of system-wide, integrated, design and
production technologies.
   ARPA is not interested in ``individual technologies for specific
processes, rather its emphasis is on ``revolutionary, enterprise-wide
systems for the shipbuilding industry that would help dramatically reduce
the total time and cost of the design and construction process in U.S.
yards.''
   Possible technologies include total process simulation/modeling,
product-to-process decomposition, material tracking, advanced CAD/CAM/CIM,
yard layout, and the integration of these with management systems
technologies.
   MARITECH proposals are expected to come from teams featuring, typically,
a technology developer(s), shipyard, supplier, and shipowner or operator,
and to include a commercialization plan for the technology.
   By the project's conclusion, the technology is required to be capable of
demonstration. The closing date for proposals is Feb. 23.
   For more information, send a fax to Robert Schaffran at (703) 696-2204.

INDUSTRY EXTOLS PASSAGE OF LAW ON MERITLESS SECURITIES SUITS

   The first congressional repudiation of a veto by President Clinton
touched off celebrations among high-tech industries.
   Just before Christmas, both the Senate and House voted to override
Clinton's veto of legislation designed to curb so-called meritless
security-fraud lawsuits (FTR, 7 Dec, 6). It was the first time that a
Clinton veto had been rejected by Congress.
   ``From a Silicon Valley perspective, we are delighted that the House and
the Senate rectified an outrageous decision to veto this legislation,''
George Sollman, vice president of the American Electronics Assn. and chief
executive of Centigram Communications Corp., said in a statement issued by
AEA Dec. 22.
   ``As people have said about Silicon Valley -- there are two types of
CEOs -- those who have been sued and those who are about to be. We hope
this legislation will put an end to this type of legalized extortion.''
According to AEA, about 53% of Silicon Valley's high-tech companies have
been sued for allegedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of the nation's
securities laws.
   The new law attempts to thwart frivolous lawsuits by giving judges power
to sanction attorneys who make such filings and by having defendants pay
settlements according to their share of guilt.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTER OFFERS MINORITY TRAINING

   Minority students will learn how to move technology from the laboratory
to the marketplace under a new program at the National Technology Transfer
Center.
   The Entrepreneurial Technology Apprentice Program (ETAP) will offer
students from historically black colleges and universities hands-on
training, mentoring and other assistance through a one-year course
addressing technology management, manufacturing assistance and industrial
r&d apprenticeships, NTTC said.
   The curriculum for the program, which is scheduled to begin in June, is
being developed by Wheeling Jesuit College, the home to NTTC, and the
center's staff.
   NTTC, a federally supported organization in Wheeling, W.Va., appointed
Faye Lyons-Gary as an associate director for ETAP.
   Lyons-Gary is one of two new officials at NTTC. The center also
announced recently its appointment of Chuck Millick as director of its
Wheeling operations.
   Lyons-Gary was the director of industrial relations at Clark Atlanta
University and The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and
Minority Institutions Environmental Technology Consortium before going to
NTTC.
   Among her other previous positions, Lyons-Gary was an intern with
Lockheed Martin Energy Systems' Office of Technology Transfer at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory.
   Currently three of the nation's 117 HBCUs are involved with ETAP:
Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio; the University of Arkansas at
Pine Bluff; and West Virginia State College in Institute, W.Va. Other
institutions have expressed interest in the program, NTTC said.
   ETAP will emphasize fund-raising so that it can expand to all HBCUs,
Lyons-Gary said.
   Although supported by the Department of Commerce's Minority Business
Development Agency, the NTTC program is also ``looking into contributions
from private industry, federal grants and foundations,'' she said.
   For more information on ETAP, call Lyons-Gary at (304) 243-4347.
   Millick, who was previously with General Electric, Kimberly Clark and
BDM, will help improve NTTC's information, training and other programs.
   ``These are very challenging times because our clients are changing as
the world is changing,'' Millick said. ``We need to work with our
customers, see what they require and provide them with valuable
resources.''
Millick said he also intends to strengthen NTTC's relationships with NASA,
which supplies the center's federal funding, and other government
agencies.

BUDGET IMPASSE STYMIES RULES ON FOREIGN LICENSES, INVENTIONS

By:
Neil MacDonald

   Two Department of Commerce proposals for modifying and streamlining
regulations for acquiring and protecting foreign rights to U.S. government
inventions, and for licensing of foreign patents acquired by the federal
government, remained in regulatory limbo at the end of the year due to the
federal budget crisis.
   They are just two of several regulatory changes proposed by DOC for
promulgation during FY-96. Most of the department has remained closed since
Dec. 16 as a result of the budget impasse, but an agency official familiar
with the proposals told Federal Technology Report last week that the
timetable for introducing the changes was now essentially up in the air.
   He said that when they were being planned last year, final action on
them by October had seemed a reasonable target. In retrospect, the present
budget situation and congressional attempts to dismantle Commerce made this
time frame look ``optimistic,'' he said.
   Although their wording has yet to be published, it is understood that
one of DOC's proposals by the Technology Administration advocates changes
to provide equal treatment of domestic and foreign rights to inventions
made by federal employees.
   Most federal inventions are the subject of only U.S. patent filings
unless there is an obvious or overwhelming need to also seek foreign patent
coverage.
   The process by which such decisions are currently made is believed to be
fairly arbitrary with some agencies seeking and often securing foreign
patent rights but failing to exploit them through foreign license
agreements. In addition, obtaining foreign patent rights is both an
expensive and time-consuming task.
   According to a DOC official, the second proposed change is ``motivated
by a desire for clarification'' of existing language regarding the
licensing of foreign patents owned by the federal government, and also
reflects some recommendations made by the Clinton administration as a
result of its campaign to ``reinvent'' government as a more efficient
enterprise.
   Both proposals -- known as Rule Identification Numbers 0692-AA15 and
0692-1116 -- are characterized as having ``substantive, nonsignificant''
priority levels with no legal deadlines and having no effect on small
entities.
   Another proposal -- 0692-AA14 -- by the Technology Administration deals
with an interim rule published in August that would allow certain federal
government contractors, mostly nonprofit organizations, small businesses
and grant recipients, to file notifications of their inventions and
election of title to funding agencies using approved forms of electronic
media.
   That rule would also update some earlier patent definitions. Final
action on the rule is expected in April.

PAPER REVIEWS FEDERAL IMPACT ON SMALL, HIGH-TECH COMPANIES

   A new report from the National Academy of Engineering suggests that one
of the best ways for Washington to help small high-tech companies is to
make sure that regulations and other traditional government functions
interfere as little as possible with their operations.
   The report, ``Risk and Innovation,'' says the government should
routinely assess the impact of its regulations on innovation among small
high-tech businesses and minimize them when possible, particularly in light
of the disfavor with which the Republican Congress looks on direct federal
funding for commercial technologies.
   Given that view on Capitol Hill, the report also urged the government to
go easy on university projects in deciding where to cut federal funding for
r&d. Campus r&d, it said, offers ``rich'' potential for new start-up
companies.
   The ``extreme budget consciousness'' in Congress means that federal
initiatives on behalf of small high-tech businesses should ``focus first on
establishing mechanisms within government -- many of them off-budget --
that can improve the general environment for innovative enterprises,'' the
report, prepared by the NAE Committee on Technology, Management, and
Capital in Small High-Tech Companies, said.
   ``Because the structure and implementation of regulations affect the
character and speed of innovation (through the risks they can create or
remove for companies), regulatory approaches across a wide variety of
government functions need to be carefully considered with regard to their
impact on small high-tech companies,'' the report said.
   The committee was chaired by Henry Kressel, managing director, Warburg,
Pincus & Co.
   ``Private investment is likely to be much greater than any imaginable
level of public investment in fragmented, technically dynamic industries
with low barriers to entry and a history (or widely perceived prospect of)
successful entrepreneurship,'' the panel said.
   ``In such industries the important question is, how can government
research, development, and demonstration complement the huge private
investment (risk-taking) to the benefit of the national economy?'' the
report said. ``The challenge in program design and implementation is to
articulate and adhere to an industry-specific rationale for government
support in light of substantial private sector activity ... .''
   The NAE committee also concluded that state and local governments should
have more say in the development of federal r&d programs, technical
assistance and other national mechanisms that promote economic growth.
``Local and regional programs may have an advantage in that they are closer
to the resources that small companies need and are potentially more able to
adapt to the needs of small high-tech companies,'' the report said.
   Although the report was not intended to comment specifically on federal
programs, it noted some concerns raised by the public regarding the
Advanced Technology Program, the Technology Reinvestment Project and the
Small Business Innovative Research program during meetings conducted by the
NAE panel.
   ``Participants in several of the industry-specific workshops, software
and medical devices in particular, noted that programs such as TRP, ATP and
SBIR that could provide financing for small high-tech companies were less
useful because of the long review cycles and time delays inherent in highly
bureaucratic programs,'' the report said.
   The NAE committee also came across criticism that SBIR spawned too many
companies, called ``SBIR houses,'' whose only income was funding from the
program, and that it adhered ``too rigidly'' to the missions of the
agencies providing its cash.
   The reaction, the report said, reflected the findings of a recent
General Accounting Office report, which concluded that while the quality of
proposals submitted to SBIR ``remains high,'' multiple awards to the same
companies ``has become a problem.''

NTIA REVISES POLICY ON GRANTS WITH `SECTARIAN' IMPLICATIONS

   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration recently
modified a policy that had prohibited it from awarding grants to
organizations involved in sectarian activities.
   Under the change, the Department of Commerce unit will no longer reject
a grant application simply on the basis that an award ``might result in
some attenuated or incidental benefit to sectarian interests,'' NTIA said
in a Dec. 20 statement.
   The revised policy affects three NTIA activities: the Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistant Program, the Public
Telecommunications Facilities Program, and the National Endowment for
Childrens's Educational Television.
   As a result of the change, the government also entered into a settlement
with Fordham University under which Fordham will receive a Public
Telecommunications Facilities Program grant to install radio broadcast
services, NTIA said.
   Fordham was previously ruled ineligible for such a grant because its
radio station broadcasts a Catholic Mass each week, NTIA said.

NIST PREPARES `ULTIMATE RULER' TO GAUGE VAST ATOMIC LANDSCAPE

   Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology are
testing what they view as the ultimate molecular ruler and a potentially
valuable tool for the semiconductor industry.
   Once fine-tuned, the Molecular Measuring Machine -- or M3 -- will be
capable of locating molecule-sized features in vast expanses and of gauging
``with unprecedented accuracy'' the distances between them, according to
NIST, which held a press conference recently to report on the machine's
progress.
   The new machine's range is 250,000 times greater than that of most
scanning tunneling microscopes, which are generally used now to perform
such measurements, NIST said.
   ``For perspective,'' NIST said, ``M3's anticipated capabilities are akin
to being able to locate two widely separated grains of sand in a ...
960-square mile patch of desert and then to measure the distance between
them to within 1 millimeter.''
   In tests so far, the machine measured specimens encompassing only a
small part of its planned 50-millimeter span, NIST said. In subsequent
tests, it will measure specimens over its entire range.
   The machine is considered especially important to the semiconductor
industry, NIST noted.
   ``For the semiconductor industry to continue its decades-long trend of
crowding ever more and ever smaller devices on slivers of silicon, it will
soon require measurement methods that are accurate to within 0.0024
micrometer, or 2.5 nanometers,'' the institute said.
   M3 will be used to calibrate various measurement references that
semiconductor manufacturers can use to check the accuracy of their own
measurement equipment, NIST said.
   A number of organizations have collaborated with NIST on the machine,
including Hewlett-Packard Corp., Zygo Corp., Intelligent Automation, Inc.,
and Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge national laboratories.
   For more information, contact Clayton Teague, chief of NIST's Nanometer
Scale Metrology Group, (301) 975-3490; E-mail, ecteague@micf.nist.gov .

REPORT PROMPTS DOE TO APPROVE LASER FUSION UNIT AT LIVERMORE

By:
David Kramer

   Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has determined formally that the National
Ignition Facility supports U.S. nonproliferation objectives, clearing the
way for construction of the $1.1 billion laser fusion device at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.
   The decision, announced Dec. 20, followed a lengthy public examination
of claims by environmental groups that NIF, which is designed to mimic on a
laboratory scale the fusion stage of nuclear weapons, would present
proliferation problems.
   A report prepared by the Department of Energy's arms control and
nonproliferation office concluded instead that NIF would advance U.S.
nonproliferation objectives because it would allow the nation to sign on to
a treaty outlawing nuclear testing.
   The unprecedented study was requested by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif.,
former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who had questioned
whether the facility would aid or hinder the spread of nuclear weapons.
O'Leary ordered the examination in September 1994. The report, which was
reviewed by outside experts, concluded that the technical proliferation
concerns posed by NIF would be ``manageable'' (FTR, 28 Sept, 12).
   ``I am pleased that we can now move forward to meet our goals in
stockpile stewardship,'' O'Leary said in a statement. ``The National
Ignition Facility will contribute to the ability of the United States to
maintain its nuclear stockpile without underground testing. We are
committed to operating the facility in the most open manner possible while
supporting our objective of reducing the global nuclear danger.''
   DOE considers NIF a key element of its ``science-based stockpile
stewardship program''-- its plan for ensuring the continuing reliability
and safety of remaining nuclear weapons without the need for underground
tests.
   Jackie Cabasso, executive director of the Western States Legal
Foundation, and a leading NIF opponent, said the report's ``conclusions are
not supported by its findings.'' The study, she said, ``does not change the
fact that NIF is a very serious threat to nonproliferation policy, both
through the development of innovative technologies for nuclear weapons
development and by example for a renewed commitment to nuclear weapons as
an instrument of national policy.''
   Cabasso called ``contradictory'' the U.S. position of supporting a
comprehensive test ban treaty while at the same time building new
facilities to substitute for testing. She also expressed dismay that the
final version of the report had not been made available publicly prior to
O'Leary's announcement, saying the omission ``belies DOE's real serious
commitment to public participation.''
   But Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., who represents the Livermore area,
commented that ``NIF will play a vital role not only in keeping America's
national defense second to none, but also in developing renewable energy
resources for our future.''
   NIF construction will bring 2,500 jobs to Livermore, while 1,000
permanent staff positions are expected to be created. The facility is
expected to be completed in 2002.

GAO QUESTIONS DOE PLAN TO MOVE SUPERCOMPUTER UNIT TO BERKELEY

By:
David Kramer

   The General Accounting Office has concluded that a Department of Energy
plan to relocate a supercomputing center from one national lab to another
will not be cost-effective, according to Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., who
requested the evaluation from the congressional watchdog.
   But DOE's number-two official insisted that the GAO findings were
``consistent with'' the agency's decision to move the center from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Deputy Secretary Charles Curtis told Baker Dec. 21 that cost was only one
of six criteria considered in the relocation.
   ``We continue to believe that our decision to relocate the center to
LBNL is in the best interest of the public ... ,'' Curtis said in a letter
to Baker. The decision, he added, ``was based on a peer review process
aimed at securing the highest level of long-term performance in [DOE]
mission areas.''
Baker, who represents the Livermore area, had cited the findings of the GAO
report, which was released Dec. 19, in asking DOE to take another look at
its plan to move the National Energy Research Supercomputer Center.
   `` ... [T]his new NERSC proposal is a costly effort that would achieve
no clear scientific benefit,'' Baker said in releasing the GAO report. ``I
am very concerned by this ill-conceived and unjustified proposal, and plan
to urge the Energy Department to carefully reevaluate it.''
   The GAO report, which examined only the costs of the NERSC move, said
that relocating the facility to LBNL could cost more than the $4.4 million
estimated by LBNL. In addition, GAO calculated that maintenance of the
facility at LBNL would cost about $617,000 more annually than it would to
keep NERSC at LLNL.
   In what DOE officials had earlier acknowledged was largely a
budget-driven exercise, DOE's Office of Energy Research sought competing
bids from LLNL and LBNL last year for operation of NERSC, and instructed
the labs to assume a 15% to 20% reduction in funding from FY-95 levels. The
labs' proposals were evaluated by an outside panel of specialists, the
majority of whom recommended that the center be relocated to LBNL.
   While the two bids were nearly identical in cost terms, LBNL offered to
run the center with essentially its existing 100 staff, while LLNL proposed
to cut 14 positions. GAO noted that LBNL was able to maintain staff levels
in part by drafting nine graduate students from the adjacent University of
California at Berkeley.
   Despite its location at LLNL, NERSC is used solely for unclassified
research, mainly by programs supported by DOE's Office of Energy Research
(ER). The decision to relocate the facility to LBNL, an ER-administered
lab, raised suspicions that DOE was motivated by a wish to consolidate ER
programs in ER facilities, and possibly ``prop up'' LBNL. Both motives were
denied by DOE officials.
   In its review, GAO warned that LBNL may have underestimated the
relocation expenses. It said that while Berkeley had included the cost to
move about 220 people within the lab to accommodate the move, additional
relocations could be required. And DOE may need to incur additional costs
to convert the vacated NERSC facility at Livermore to a new use, it said.
   A DOE official said this week that LBNL has since ``scrubbed'' the
moving estimates and stands by the $4.4 million figure.
   GAO said David Nelson, the ER associate director for computational and
technology research, told its auditors that cost was only one of six
criteria that his office used in evaluating the proposals. Others included
benefits to ER; impact on ER missions through interdisciplinary internal
and external collaborations; lab management's support; and demonstrated
capability to integrate future technological advances to support ER's
computing and communications needs.
   Baker complained that many LLNL employees will experience considerable
inconvenience because of the ``unsound'' move.
   ``I am very concerned that for the sake of bureaucratic reshuffling, a
significant number of hard-working men and women are going to have to begin
prolonged commutes from Livermore to Berkeley,'' he said. ``Satisfying
Washington bureaucrats is not a good enough reason to disrupt the lives of
LLNL employees.''
   Baker also termed unsatisfactory the explanation he had received from
Curtis for the relocation, which was announced Nov. 3.
   ``Mr. Curtis said in his [Nov. 3] letter that LBNL offered `superior
long-range vision' and `improved opportunities for internal and external
collaboration.' This is obscure, bureaucratic nonsense that fails to
explain any sound basis for the proposed move,'' he said.

LIVERMORE CONFERENCE EXPLORES NEW LINKS WITH SMALL BUSINESS

   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hosted a one-day conference last
month to explore new ways for large organizations, including national labs,
to forge links with small- and medium-sized manufacturers and suppliers.
The conference was co-sponsored by the CommerceNet ``Commerce at Light
Speed'' project, an effort by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency to promote business over the Internet, and by LLNL, in
support of the Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing-National
Information Infrastructure program.
   According to the LLNL Newsline, Roger Flanagan, AM-NII project
coordinator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said the $24 million effort
was initiated in 1994 in recognition that DOE was still doing many things
``the old way.'' He said project founders realized that DOE needed to
employ new manufacturing strategies used by private industry as well as new
information technologies to streamline and strengthen relationships with
commercial suppliers.
   The program's current emphasis, Flanagan said, is on filling needs
affecting several sites managed by DOE's Defense Programs division,
outsourcing more services and completing pilot projects in key technical
areas. These areas include distributed simulation (Y-12 Plant), technical
data exchange (Kansas City Plant), security and intelligence agents (Sandia
National Laboratories), enterprise information modeling (Los Alamos
National Laboratory) and electronic commerce (LLNL).
   Mike Snow, the DP representative for AM-NII, told Newsline that DOE's
weapons complex used to have a high volume of design and production tasks
with competition between sites for assignments and plenty of time and
resources to get the job done.
   Today DOE is fielding no new nuclear weapons designs and is dedicated to
maintaining the nuclear stockpile and components. In fulfilling its new
responsibilities, he said, the department is facing a scarcity of
resources, uncertain production needs, limited testing opportunities,
declining funding, an aging work force and a shrinking knowledge base.
   To overcome these challenges, Snow told Newsline, DOE must initiate
greater teamwork among its many departments and labs and with its
industrial suppliers, limit and expedite prototypes, do more modeling and
simulation work and move to more flexible manufacturing. It must also
improve information handling to connect workers with data instead of
``moving bodies around'' from site to site.

LAB RESURRECTS CLOSED FACILITY FOR ION-IMPLANTATION RESEARCH

   With help from a shuttered fusion experiment at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, a new process for surface treating materials to improve their
wear resistance will soon go commercial.
   Scientists at Los Alamos and the University of Wisconsin have begun
working under an Advanced Technology Program-backed cooperative r&d
agreement with an 11-company consortium that includes General Motors Corp.
Harley-Davidson Inc. and A.O. Smith Corp., to further scale up the
technique of implanting ions on the surfaces of materials. The implantation
process alters the structure of the material in such a way as to harden
it.
   According to Don Rej, a LANL technical staff member who was the first
principal investigator on the project, the CRADA partners are using a
UW-developed process known as Plasma Surface Ion Implantation and
equipment, facilities and computer modeling capabilities at LANL. The first
two commercial systems for PSII are being built by North Star Research
Corp., Albuquerque, N.M.
   One of the North Star-built units is to be placed in commercial
wear-hardening service at Empire Hard Chrome Inc., Chicago. It is expected
to be used for large-scale automotive and other industrial applications.
The other unit will be shipped to a research facility in Finland.
   Prior to perfecting the plasma technique of implantation, the PSII
process was considered too expensive, slow and complicated for widespread
commercial use. But, according to the fall issue of ``USCAR Dateline
2000,'' a comprehensive cost analysis, including amortized capital
equipment, personnel and consumables, predict large-scale treatment costs
of less than half a penny per square centimeter.
   According to Rej, the primary advantage to the PSII process over the
better-known beamline ion implantation method, is the former's ability to
harden material faces which are not in the ``line of sight'' of a beam. In
PSII, the part is immersed in the plasma in which the ions are produced.
Beamlines are produced by accelerators, and if more than one surface area
is to be treated, the part must be manipulated to expose the particular
surfaces.
   GM and LANL recently completed work in PSSI under a CRADA that began in
1991. According to Rej, the lab is now proposing to continue that work
under auspices of the threatened Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, the consortium of several government agencies and the Big Three
automakers.
   According to a summary of the three-year, $15.5 million ATP project,
automakers are interested in the process because it could be used to treat
the surfaces of lightweight aluminum or magnesium alloys so they can
withstand the high wear and other demanding environmental conditions
characteristic of engines. Substituting these materials for steel and iron
could result in a 10% decrease in the cost of making automobile
powertrains.
   ATP is administered by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
   PSII also could be used to treat the surfaces of dies and tools,
resulting in an expected 10-fold increase in performance life.
   The ATP project will aim to develop and demonstrate prototype
technologies for high-volume applications of PSII. The technology has never
been applied in treatment chambers larger than 1 cubic meter. Unknowns
include the behavior of plasmas in large systems and the uniformity of
treatment achieved on irregularly shaped parts.
   Rej said LANL's primary contribution has been scaling up the technology,
which was developed by UW with support from the National Science
Foundation. The university had only a small table-top unit, while Los
Alamos had a much larger device left over when DOE canceled its alternative
concepts fusion program. The lab also had high voltage technology from its
nuclear physics and Strategic Defense Initiative programs, and computer
modeling capabilities from its nuclear weapons program.
   Other members of the ATP consortium are ABB High Power Semiconductors,
Pittsburgh; Diversified Technologies Inc., Bedford, Mass.; Empire Hard
Chrome; IONEX, Bellaire, Mich.; Kwikset Corp., Anaheim, Calif.; Litton
Electronic Devices, San Carlos, Calif.; NANO Instruments Inc., Oak Ridge,
Tenn.; and PVI, Oxnard, Calif.

DOE'S BARTLESVILLE LAB EXTENDS $100,000 FOR OIL-RECOVERY R&D

   The Department of Energy's National Institute for Petroleum and Energy
Research, Bartlesville, Okla., will provide $100,000 to James E. Russell
Petroleum Inc. to improve a new process to clean water used in oil field
operations.
   The ``air flotation process'' emerged from an earlier DOE co-sponsored
project with Russell Petroleum and the University of Kansas. Russell
Petroleum, Abilene, Texas, will contribute $102,000 of its own to continue
research on the project.
   According to DOE, water produced with oil is often reinjected into the
reservoir to increase the efficiency of the oil recovery operation. But
impurities in the water can plug the tiny pores in the reservoir rock,
often blocking the water from reaching the target zones.
   In the air flotation process, air is bubbled through a flotation column.
Waste impurities cling to the air bubbles and are removed from the water.
The technique, a modification of a process originally developed to clean
coal and other minerals, has been used in some offshore oil operations. It
was unclear, however, whether the process would be cost-effective for
onshore oil fields, particularly those operated by smaller, independent
producers, DOE said.
   According to DOE, the original Russell Petroleum project showed that the
air flotation device may make economic sense for many independent
producers. The company credits the technology with contributing to the
recovery of some 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would have been left
in the ground.
   Under the second phase of the project, which will last 18 months,
Russell Petroleum will develop screening criteria to help other producers
determine where and when the process can be applied; develop optimum design
and operating guidelines for the technology; determine the cost of
implementing critical design improvements; and communicate the correct
method of applying the technology and its benefits to other operators.
   The original project was funded under DOE's Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program, which is aimed at demonstrating ways that oil
producers can avoid prematurely abandoning their wells.
   The Russell Petroleum follow-on project is the result of a solicitation
DOE issued to the 33 participants in the ``near-term'' category of the
program. The department has recently requested proposals for follow-on
projects from participants in ``mid-term'' and other categories of the
program.

ELECTROCHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL

   Los Alamos National Laboratory is testing a simple treatment method that
may help small businesses eliminate hazardous wastes from their production
lines. The system may also greatly reduce the volume of inorganic mixed
wastes in storage at Department of Energy facilities like Los Alamos.
   The electrochemical process works at room temperature and low pressure
and runs on familiar direct-current electricity, the lab said. It does not
produce toxic fumes or secondary waste.
   Heavy metals are removed and recovered. Cyanides and toxic organic
compounds are broken into harmless carbon dioxide and nitrogen. And all the
work is done by electrons flowing through the solution.
   The system may prove to be a boon to hospitals and industries that
produce small volumes of hazardous waste, the lab said. Developing separate
treatment methods for each kind of waste is prohibitively expensive. The
electrochemical process, in contrast, can treat many substances cheaply and
safely.
   In December, Los Alamos began expanding the treatment system from a
bench-top experiment that handled less than 2 gallons per day to a pilot
project capable of treating the contents of a 55-gallon drum per day. Jacek
Dziewinski, who leads the project, estimated about 90% of the inorganic
mixed wastes at Los Alamos could be treated using this method.
   Los Alamos is developing the treatment system in partnership with
Faraday Technology Inc., Dayton, Ohio. The company is optimizing the
process for industrial waste streams, especially those with heavy metals,
while Los Alamos is working on mixed waste containing radioactive
materials.
   The original work that led to the concepts developed by Faraday
Technology Inc. was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the
Department of Defense. The Los Alamos research is sponsored by the
Laboratory's Environmental Management Programs.
   For more information, contact Dziewinski at (505) 667-9792.

PARTNERS FOR BIOFUEL PROJECT

   Companies interested in forming partnerships for the development of
commercial equipment for a unique biomass pretreatment technology are being
sought by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Described by NREL as an
``important step in an overall process for producing ethanol and
potentially other commodity chemicals from cellulose biomass,'' the
technology is part of a major project within a biofuels program that NREL
manages for the Department of Energy.
   The project involves the conversion of a wide range of cellulosic
biomass items, such as agricultural and forestry residues, wastepaper,
municipal solid waste, underutilized wood, waste from paper and pulp
production, herbaceous energy crops, and woody energy crops, into ethanol
as a transportation fuel.
   Currently NREL is operating a process development unit (PDU) from which
it is gathering essential data for scaling up the pilot plant to a size
able to commercialize the conversion of biomass to ethanol. Potential
corporate partners would be encouraged to use the PDU infrastructure to
evaluate pilot-scale or prototype equipment designs, the lab said.
   With ethanol production from corn already providing over 1 billion
gallons a year for fuel blending purposes, NREL feels that ``significant
opportunities to further penetrate'' the oxygenate market in the short
term, as well as supply of large amounts of near-pure ethanol for use as a
gasoline substitute, could exist if the costs of ethanol production from
cellulosic biomass could be lowered.
   At this stage, NREL is only seeking ``expressions of interest'' from
potential partners and sees several possible collaborative mechanisms,
including cooperative r&d agreements, cost-shared subcontracts, and
researcher exchanges.
   For more information, contact Ray Prazak at (303) 384-6876 or Scott
Montgomery at (303) 275-3193.
