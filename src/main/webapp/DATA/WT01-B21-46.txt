<h2>Our View </h2>

<h3>Anti-drug focus keeps marijuana from the ill </h3>

<p> Many who suffer from various diseases could benefit from
marijuana. But they're denied relief. </p>

<p> In the war on drugs, thousands of Americans are suffering
from friendly fire. </p>

<p> They are, for the most part, patients with cancer, multiple
sclerosis and AIDS who are doomed to needless pain and weightloss
syndrome because lawmakers won't approve the medicinal use of
marijuana. </p>

<p> Marijuana is one of the least toxic medical compounds in the
world. It poses far fewer pulmonary risks than tobacco and is
less addictive than alcohol. It is even less deadly than aspirin,
which causes at least 1,000 deaths a year. </p>

<p> Despite its benign qualities, marijuana is versatile and
effective. It has been used to treat pain, depression and spasms.
It has been used to help prevent glaucoma-related blindness and
appears effective in battling weight loss in AIDS patients. It
also has been widely used to mitigate nausea caused by
chemotherapy. Indeed, a study by researchers at the Kennedy
School of Government found that 44% of the surveyed oncologists
had recommended marijuana to at least one patient for nausea. </p>

<p> Polls find public support for marijuana's medicinal use
running from 65% to 78%. And 22 states have acted to endorse
medicinal marijuana, often either by authorizing state-sponsored
research or simply allowing physicians to prescribe it despite
federal prohibitions that keep such laws from going into effect.
California's Legislature has twice passed laws enabling such use.
Both were vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson, forcing a third attempt in
the form of an initiative on the November ballot. </p>

<p> Opponents say the medical value of marijuana is anecdotal.
But those anecdotes number in the thousands and date back
thousands of years. Penicillin was approved for use with far less
experience and data - six patients, to be exact. </p>

<p> Obviously, studies are needed to better assess marijuana's
efficacy. Several, including one done in New York state, have
shown marijuana to be an effective alternative to other
anti-nausea treatments. And the Food and Drug Administration has
endorsed additional research. </p>

<p> But why make today's suffering patients wait, particularly
those with diseases that make the potential side effects look
trivial? </p>

<p> Medicinal marijuana use doesn't betray the nation's war on
drugs. Illegal use or trafficking can still be prosecuted.
Moreover, there's no reason to fear that the new leniency will
increase drug use. The same concern has been expressed about
needle exchange programs, used to prevent the spread of AIDS
among heroin addicts. But numerous reviews, including one by the
National Academy of Sciences, show no resulting increase in
heroin use. </p>

<p> It is entirely possible to fight the drug war without harming
innocent civilians in the process. But lawmakers must be careful
to choose the right battles. Therapeutic marijuana use isn't one
of them. </p>

<h2>Opposing View </h2>

<h3>Marijuana isn't medicine</h3>

<p> According to experts, marijuana has no scientific value and
actually may be harmful. </p>

<p> By Eric A. Voth </p>

<p> The saga of &quot;medicinal&quot; marijuana continues to
unfold. Two new chapters are coming forth which should be of
major concern: </p>

<p> California will vote Nov. 5 on a ballot initiative which
dramatically liberalizes the availability of crude, smoked
marijuana for individuals. </p>

<p> Arizona will consider an initiative which would make all of
what the law calls Schedule I drugs available as medicines. This
means heroin, LSD, methamphetamine, ecstasy, marijuana, etc.,
could be prescribed to patients who allege benefits. </p>

<p> Marijuana is not a safe and effective medicine. </p>

<p> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has
clearly defined that marijuana is not a medicine. </p>

<p> The National Institutes of Health have reviewed the issue and
determined that crude marijuana adds nothing to the treatment of
sick patients, actually adds risk to patients and has no
scientifically proven benefits over existing medicines. </p>

<p> Neither the American Cancer Society nor the American Medical
Association supports smoking marijuana as medicine. </p>

<p> Voters should realize that the move to legitimize marijuana
or other illegal drugs as medicines is driven by organizations
seeking to generally legalize drugs. </p>

<p> The smoke screens they lay down are very similar to the
deceit and misrepresentation by the tobacco industry which have
drawn so much criticism from the public. To support marijuana or
other illegal drugs as medicines is like suggesting that tobacco
should be allowed as a medicine for anxiety or weight loss. </p>

<p> Marijuana as a medicine is part of the grand scheme of
&quot;harm reduction&quot; advocates who will also propose such
things as decriminalization of drugs and needle exchanges. These
are flawed policies which do not seek to actually reduce drug
use. </p>

<p> Needle exchanges, for instance, do not clearly demonstrate
reductions in disease, do not reduce drug use and do not deal
with product liability and exposure issues surrounding the
handing out of thousands of needles to addicts. </p>

<p> It is tragic that the proponents of medicinal marijuana and
harm-reduction policies are taking advantage of cancer and AIDS
sufferers to further their social agendas. </p>

<p> Let's provide sick patients with good medicine rather than
stepping back to the days of potions and herbal remedies. </p>
