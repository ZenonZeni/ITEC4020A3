 NEWSHARE CORP. JOINS AD INDUSTRY'S INTERACTIVE ALLIANCE;<br>
 SAYS ITS CLICKSHARE SYSTEM WILL SUPPORT "CASIE" GUIDELINES<br>
<p>
        WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Nov. 13 -- Newshare Corp., developer of the<br>
Clickshare tracking and transaction system, said Monday it had joined the<br>
Interactive Alliance, an advertising-industry consortium developing<br>
Internet audience-measurement standards.<br>
<p>
        The company also said it will support privacy and other guidelines<br>
contained in an industry white paper developed by the Coalition for<br>
Advertising Supported Information and Entertainment (CASIE). CASIE's<br>
members control the majority of the $150 billion U.S. advertising market.<br>
<p>
        "The addition of Clickshare adds strength to The Interactive<br>
Alliance," said Marshall L. Snyder, executive vice president, Arbitron<br>
NewMedia and an alliance founder. "Their business proposition has the<br>
potential to generate large numbers of identified web users."<br>
<p>
        Newshare Corp. is alpha-testing its Clickshare system, which<br>
enables Internet publishers to cooperate in generating and sharing content<br>
revenues. The absence of a micro- transaction information standard has<br>
prevented many publishers from using the World Wide Web so far.<br>
<p>
        Under Clickshare, each consumer chooses a most-trusted publisher to<br>
whom to identify himself/herself and Clickshare will never see the names.<br>
That publisher and user determine how the user's name and demographic<br>
information may be used.<br>
<p>
Simplifying information access<br>
<p>
        Clickshare enables the anonymous tracking of individual users as<br>
they jump among unrelated Internet sites, and offers a facility to settle<br>
information transactions down to as little as 10 cents. Clickshare<br>
requires no special user software and simplifies user access to<br>
information by rendering multiple registration at Web sites unnecessary.<br>
<p>
        "The Interactive Alliance has already brought together so much of<br>
the industry in acknowledging common principles, it will make our job<br>
easier to bring about publisher cooperation,"  said Bill Densmore,<br>
Newshare's president. "And the CASIE working group principles strike a<br>
laudable balance among marketing requirements for a user census, the<br>
consumer's need for ease-of-use and democracy's need to assure personal<br>
privacy."<br>
<p>
        CASIE is a joint project of the Association of National<br>
Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies with the<br>
support of the Advertising Research Foundation. It seeks to define a<br>
universal standard for third- party verification of audience claims by Web<br>
publishers which gathers uniform usage data about individual users, while<br>
respecting their privacy.<br>
<p>
        "Audience measurement efforts which adhere to the CASIE principles<br>
should help grow interactive media and benefit all those involved,<br>
including advertisers, media buyers and sellers," said Judy Black, senior<br>
partner and director of the BJK&amp;E Interactive Group and also the chair of<br>
the CASIE research subcommittee.<br>
<p>
What is the Alliance?<br>
<p>
        The Interactive Alliance is working to assemble the most<br>
comprehensive and definitive ongoing database on worldwide interactive<br>
media use. It was formed in 1995 by Next Century Media Inc., and The<br>
Arbitron Company. Other consortium members, in addition to Newshare Corp.,<br>
now include Interse, McCollum Spielman Worldwide and MarketCast.<br>
<p>
        The Audit Bureau of Circulations and its technical support<br>
affiliate, WebTrack, have agreed to be participants in the work of The<br>
Alliance. Representatives of over 40 other industry organizations have<br>
agreed to participate as alliance advisors.<br>
<p>
        "Clickshare and The Interactive Alliance share a philosophy of<br>
cooperatively lifting the Interactive lake to raise all ships,"  noted<br>
Bill Harvey, president and CEO, Next Century Media. "It turns out that the<br>
Internet, which arose like topsy with no central direction, can become a<br>
more valuable business for content providers and advertisers by the same<br>
process of decentralized collaboration."<br>
<p>
        The advertising and publishing industries are struggling to reach<br>
a technology and consensus for the measurement and tracking of World Wide<br>
Web usage. The Newspaper Association of America has convened a Nov. 14<br>
summit in Dallas so that major publishers and system vendors can discuss<br>
audience measurement principles. Newshare is among invited participants in<br>
the summit.<br>
<p>
