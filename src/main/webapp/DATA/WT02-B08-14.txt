<CENTER><B>Oxygenate Industry Unites to Promote RFG
</B></CENTER>
<P>
In a demonstration of unity, representatives of the American Methanol
Institute, Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Oxygenated Fuels
Association and Renewable Fuels Association have co-signed a letter
to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Carol Browner
describing the superior air quality benefits of reformulated gasoline
(RFG) and seeking the Agency's help in more aggressively promoting
RFG across the country.  <BR>

<P>
According to RFA President Eric Vaughn, &quot;this letter should
signal to anyone interested in the RFG program that the entire
oxygenate industry is actively promoting the benefits of this
important program and working to expand its use.  We are concerned
that areas in need of cost-effective ozone control are missing
out on the opportunity provided by RFG.  Simply put, there is
no better means of reducing ozone than through RFG.  We are asking
EPA to work closely with us to assure the widest possible use
of this clean-burning fuel.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The letter to Browner is accompanied by a memorandum from former
U.S. Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources, James
Moorman, detailing several instances where the potential benefits
of RFG have been foregone in favor of low-RVP (Reid vapor pressure)
programs.  Low-RVP fuels simply reduce gasoline volatility and
do not have the additional ozone or toxic-reduction benefits of
RFG.  <BR>

<P>
Fred Craft, Executive Director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association
stated, &quot;the inclusion of oxygenates in RFG is essential
to reducing ozone-forming emissions from our nation's fuel.  Oxygenates
alone reduce all precursors to urban ozone -- VOCs, carbon monoxide
and NOx.&quot;  Referring to a comprehensive analysis comparing
the ozone exceedances for 1995 to 1994,  Craft stated, &quot;the
data indicates that areas using RFG had a 9% reduction in ozone
exceedances, while areas using low-RVP gasoline had a 94% increase
in exceedances.  The bottom line is RFG works, and it works because
of the addition of oxygenates.&quot;<BR>

<P>
American Methanol Institute President Ray Lewis stated, &quot;we
are all extremely enthusiastic about the benefits of RFG.  The
oxygenate industry  believes that by working more closely with
EPA we will be able to achieve our mutual goal of expanding the
use of RFG to improve air quality across the country.  Our message
to EPA is clear -- let's do what needs to be done to promote the
benefits of RFG as effectively as possible.&quot;<BR>

<P>
According to CFDC Executive Director, Douglas A. Durante, &quot;Following
the first year of the RFG program, the effectiveness of RFG with
oxygenates at reducing air pollution is clear.  No other pollution
reduction method has achieved such dramatic results.  CFDC members,
which include Ford, GM, and Chrysler, look forward to continued
cooperation from EPA to educate the public about the benefits
of RFG.&quot;<BR>
