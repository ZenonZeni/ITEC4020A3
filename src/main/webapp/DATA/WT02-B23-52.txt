<H2>Cargo ships in odd Gulf
of Mexico collision</H2></CENTER>
	Two cargo ships, the Greek vessel Alexia and the Singapore-flagged Enif collided in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 70 miles south of New Orleans near Southwest Pass around midnight on July 1st. As the vessels remained lodged together,drifting east at about 1 m.p.h., several nearby oil rigs in their path scrambled to evacuate their personnel until three tugs arrived to control the ships' drift.  About  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="ships.gif"ALT="[photo of collision]">93,000 gallons of fuel leaked from a ruptured fuel tank on the Enif, eventually creating an oil sheen 19 miles long but posed no environmental hazard. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

	Both ships took on some water but neither were in danger of sinking, nor where there any injuries.  Coast Guard units, including a helicoptor and the 210-foot cutter Courageous soon arrived on the scene to find the 750-foot Alexia's bulbous bow imbedded just abaft of beam in the Enif's port side. Containment booms were placed around the vessels. Several days later, following some hot work with welding torches to cut loose mangled steel, the ships were pulled apart, leaving unanswered a question that was on the minds of many mariners: How the hell did it happen? <P>
	At the time of the collision, 12:10 a.m. the night of July 1st., the 514-foot freighter Enif was outbound in the channel while the Alexia (carrying no cargo) was proceeding inbound. The weather was fair, the seas calm, and by all accounts both vessels were operating within normal limits.  In the absense of comment from either of the ship's masters (who were constrained from so doing for insurance reasons) or the Coast Guard, which at this writing has not released the official results of its investigation, observers were only able to surmise from the photo of the two conjoined ships that the Enif appeared to have the right of way. <P>
	Unofficially, however, a source close to the investigation, predicted that the findings will show that both ships shared responsibility. "It's obvious from the angle in the photos that one of the ships had the right of way. But this was one of those classic situations that happens during a watch relief - the mid-watch was just coming on as the situation was developing. What's so odd is that if either vessel had, independent of the other, done any one of three or four things, it would have been just another nice day at sea." <P>
