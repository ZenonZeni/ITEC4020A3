Mutual Fund Q and A: Tackling the Practical Issues </H2><P>
<HR>

<strong>How many different mutual funds should I own?</strong><p>

The number of funds suitable for an individual investor will vary depending on individual circumstances--there is no universal number that applies for everyone.<p>


However, as a useful yardstick, consider the range of funds derived from the rationale that diversification should be one of every investor's goals. Simple but broad diversification would imply four funds: a domestic equity fund, a domestic bond fund, an international stock fund and an international bond fund. Dividing the domestic equity portion into two funds--one specializing in small stocks and the other larger capitalization stocks, brings the count up to five. Splitting the international equity portion into funds specializing in developed economies and funds specializing in developing and emerging economies makes six. If you prefer a separate European fund and Far East fund, the total is up to seven. Building diversity in your domestic bonds by adding a junk bond fund stretches the number of funds to eight. And if you include a money market fund, you have nine.<p>


The benefits of diversification are difficult to achieve with commitments of less than 10% of your portfolio to any one area, which sets the upper range at not much more than 10 funds. Thus, diversification implies a range of around four to nine funds--all unique in investment objective and security coverage.<p>


Overdiversification results in fund investments that essentially duplicate each other; this adds nothing to performance, but it will add frustration as well as cost in keeping track of and monitoring so many mutual funds.<p>

<br>

<strong>Should I make sure to invest in more than one fund family, for diversification?</strong> <p>


No--it is possible to stay within a fund family and be adequately diversified. However, there is a danger in remaining doggedly within one fund family solely for convenience, and that is when you overlook a better-managed fund elsewhere. For instance, rather than seek out the best international fund, you may choose the one offered by the fund family you are in currently because it is most convenient.<p>

<br>

<strong>Can a mutual fund be too large?</strong><p>


Yes. But it can also be too small. The benefits or stigmatism of size depend on the segment of the market that the fund operates in, as well as its investment style.<p>


For example, when it comes to a U.S. government bond fund, a behemoth is probably best. Large funds have lower costs, as a percentage of total assets, and the U.S. government bond market is one of the most efficient in the world, able to handle large transactions without significant price changes. Similarly, large asset bases benefit corporate bond funds by spreading expenses, and because credit risk is spread more widely among different issuers.<p>


On the equity side, index funds can benefit by size because expenses can be spread more widely. Index funds are passively managed, that is, there is no portfolio manager who is constantly making investment decisions, so the investment advisory fee is low; a low annual expense ratio is one of the advantages of investing in these kinds of funds. <p>


However, size can be a detriment to actively managed stock funds. These funds may lose some flexibility when assets reach $500 million and many eventually close before reaching $1 billion because of trading and stock selection difficulties. Actively managed funds that focus on larger companies begin to resemble index funds when assets are large and spread over many stocks, so you may be receiving a near market index return while paying extra for active management.<p>


Size can also be a detriment to funds specializing in small stocks. These stocks have less trading volume, and it can be difficult to trade larger positions without affecting prices (pushing prices up on purchase, and down when sold).<p>

<br>

<strong>What should I do when my fund closes?</strong><p>


Nothing. Many funds that close their doors to new investors will allow existing shareholders to continue to invest new money, although sometimes with limits, and all closed funds allow continuation of investments for existing IRA-type accounts. In the long run, you may be better off if your fund closes and maintains its investment style and flexibility rather than outgrowing its past success.<p>

<br>

<strong>Should I switch out of a fund if the portfolio manager changes?</strong><p>


No. The change of a portfolio manager is not reason, in and of itself, to leave a fund. Instead, monitor the fund closely to make sure the new manager is continuing the old manager's style, and that any changes won't significantly affect your investment. New portfolio managers have been known to take command of a fund and sell off securities, reflecting a change in style. A significant portfolio realignment might mean greater capital gains distributions, and therefore taxes, unless you hold the fund in a tax-sheltered account. On the other hand, if the fund is an index fund or less actively managed, the portfolio manager may not be all that important. Or the new portfolio manager may continue with the old style and perform just fine.<p>


Switch to a fund with a similar investment objective only when the performance of your fund falls off against other funds with the same investment objective, or if your existing fund changes objectives so that it no longer reflects the objective you are seeking.<p>

<br>

<strong>My fund just imposed a load. Should I bail out?</strong><p>


If your fund imposed a load, you may be grandfathered in and allowed to invest new funds without a load. But if they do charge a load on additional money you want to invest, you are faced with a dilemma. Don't sell on the news that the fund is going to impose a load, but certainly don't commit new money if you will be charged an unreasonable load.<p>

<br>

<strong>Should I be concerned with fund expenses? After all, it's already reflected in the fund's performance numbers. </strong><p>


Fund expenses, including the management fee, reduce fund performance and all quoted return numbers reflect these costs. But the reason to examine past performance is to get an indication of the portfolio manager's skill. And while the performance numbers may provide some indication of the manager's past skill, the future performance of that manager remains uncertain. The only certainty about the fund's future are the expenses, which are assessed regardless of whether a fund's performance has been relatively good or bad.<p>


Exceptionally high expenses are nearly impossible for portfolio managers to overcome relative to similar funds with average or low expenses. The lower the expenses, the better. <p>


The table below provides average expense ratios (expenses as a percentage of total assets managed) for various types of mutual funds. These can provide you with some guidelines when examining individual fund expenses. Expense ratio and expense breakdown for individual funds are given in the mutual fund prospectus.<p>

<strong>Should I pay any attention to mutual fund portfolio turnover ratios?</strong><p>


The portfolio turnover ratio (given in the prospectus) is the lower of purchases or sales of assets in the fund relative to the average assets in the fund for the year. A turnover ratio of 100% indicates that the dollar value of fund purchases or sales equaled the dollar value of total fund assets during the year.The higher the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which can hurt the performance of the fund; while these costs are reflected in the fund's net asset value and its performance figures, they are a concern for the future performance as noted in the question above.<p>


Equally important for taxable investors, the higher the turnover, the more likely the fund is to make capital gains distributions; and taxes must be paid on these distributions.<p>


What is high turnover and what is low? Stock funds average around 80% portfolio turnover, and bond funds are close to 100%. Use portfolio turnover as a tie-breaker. If you find two funds in the same category that are equally appealing, lean toward the fund with a lower portfolio turnover.<p>
