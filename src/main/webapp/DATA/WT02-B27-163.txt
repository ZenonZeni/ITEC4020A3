<h3>Introduction</h3>
<BR>Holland (or more properly, the Netherlands) is the only country in the world where euthanasia is openly practiced. It is not allowed by statute, but the law accepts a standard defence from doctors that have adhered to official guidelines. These hinge on voluntariness of the request and unrelievable-ness of the suffering. It is <cite>not</cite> a condition that the patient is terminally ill or that the suffering is physical.

<BR><BR>In practice, citizens of other countries are not eligible for euthanasia in the Netherlands. <cite>UK residents can get a free factsheet on the Termination of Life by a Doctor in the Netherlands by writing to the Press & Cultural Section of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in London (Tel 0171-584-5040 ext.413), an excerpt from which is printed below.</cite>
 
<BR><BR>&quotEuthanasia is popularly taken to mean any form of termination of life by a doctor. The definition under Dutch law, however, is narrower. It means the termination of life by a doctor at the express wish of a patient. The request to the doctor must be voluntary, explicit and carefully considered and it must have been made repeatedly. Moreover, the patient's suffering must be unbearable and without any prospect of improvement. Pain relief administered by a doctor may shorten a patient's life. As is the case in other countries, this is seen as a normal medical decision in terminal care and not as euthanasia.&quot
<BR><BR>

<a name="term">

<h3>Terminology</h3>
The word &quotvoluntary&quot in <i>voluntary euthanasia</i> emphasizes the express intent of the person wanting to die, and distinguishes it from mercy killing
or any other form of killing. Voluntary euthanasia is performed by, or at the autonomous request of, an informed and competent
patient. In the Netherlands this phrase, however, is not used; the word &quoteuthanasia&quot simply implying voluntary euthanasia, since if it is not
voluntary it is not regarded in the Netherlands as euthanasia. Euthanasia comes under the generic heading of &quotMedical Decisions to End Life&quot (MDELs). It is defined by the Dutch Government Commission on Euthanasia (1985) as &quot<strong>A deliberate termination of an individual's life at that individual's request, by another. Or, in medical practice, the active and deliberate termination of a patient's life, on that patient's request, by a doctor.&quot</strong>
<BR><BR>

<a name="req">
<HR>
<BR><h3>Requirements</h3>
Doctors will not be prosecuted if they have met the substantive requirements published by the Royal Dutch Medical Association in 1984 (also confirmed by court decisions). These are:
<BR><li>the patient makes a voluntary request
<BR><BR>
<li>the request must be well considered
<li>the wish for death is durable
<li>the patient is in unacceptable suffering
<li>the physician has consulted a colleague who agrees the proposed course of action
<BR><BR>

<HR>
<h3>Notification</h3>
The Royal Dutch Medical Association and the Ministry of Justice in 1990 agreed a notification procedure with the following elements, subsequently laid down in regulations under the Burial Act.
<BR><BR>
<li>the physician performing the euthanasia or assited suicide does not issue a declaration of natural death, but informs the local medical examiner of the circumstances by filling in an extensive questionnaire
<li>the medical examiner reports to the districty attorney
<li>the district attorney then decides whether or not a prosecution shouold be instituted
<BR><BR>

<BR><h3>Physical administration</h3>
In the Netherlands, the practice is an injection to render the patient comatose, followed by a second injection to stop the heart. 
Official guidelines encourage the doctor to allow the patient to take the lethal dosage, under supervision, if this is a practical alternative.

<h3>Applicability to other countries</h3>
In the last fifty years, several western countries have grappled with the dilemmas associated with advancing medical technology, greater life expectancy and the difficulties associated with unbearable suffering. Some are looking at ways to allow euthanasia, and the Netherlands is often cited as a role model. Many researchers, in the Netherlands and abroad, have drawn attention to the specific characteristics of Dutch culture and suggested that countries need to find their own solutions rather than simply try to import the Dutch system wholesale. An Australian state has passed a law that both allows euthanasia and promotes palliative care; Several American states have presented challenges to the constitutionality of laws against assisted suicide. Major research continues in Scotland, home of the first book in the world on &quotself-deliverance&quot.
<BR><BR>
Some of the factors that make the Netherlands different:
<BR><BR>
<li>There is a high standard of medical care - amongst the highest in the world. The majority (over 95%) of people are covered by private medical insurance, guaranteeing a large core of basic healthcare, including long-term care
<li>Palliative care is very advanced. Pain and palliation centres are attached to all hospitals. Other countries, by comparison, have costly but relatively few such centres (normally known as &quothospices&quot)
<li>During the Nazi occupation, Dutch doctors went to concentration camps rather than divulge the names of their patients. This is one of the factors that increase the relationship of trust between doctors and patients, to a much higher level than in most other countries. Moreover, most patients know their doctor well, and over a considerable time period.

<h3>Some dates</h3>
<li>1973 Voluntary Euthanasia societies formed in the Netherlands
<li>1981 A Rotterdam court states conditions under which aiding suicide and administering Voluntary Euthanasia will not lead to prosecution
in the Netherlands
<li>1984 The Supreme Court of the Netherlands declares that V.E. is acceptable subject to ten clearly defined conditions
<li>1990 Notification procedure agreed between the Royal Dutch Medical Association and the Ministry of Justice
<li>1994 Amendments under the Burial Act incorporate the notification procedure, giving the latter formal legal status

<BR><BR>&quotThe Netherlands has become the first country in Europe to pass a law defining the responsibilities of doctors to their patients. 
Doctors must now provide clear information, written down if requested, before they obtain consent for any operation. This information
must include the nature, goals, and risks of the treatment. This can be overruled, but only if a doctor can argue that it would put the
patient at a serious disadvantage; then the information must be given to a third party. The patient's wish not to be given information
must be respected unless this would present dangers to the patient or to others. 
Doctors are legally obliged to honour living wills.&quot

<BR><BR>p.166: &quotThe State Commission defines euthanasia as the intentional termination of life by another party at the request of the person
concerned.&quot

<BR><BR><BR><strong>Kimsma G, Leeuwen E. <cite>Dutch Euthanasia: Background, Practice, and Present Justifications.</cite></strong> Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare
Ethics 1993; 2:19-35. 
<BR><BR>p.22: &quotIn 1972... the Dutch Reformed Church published a pastoral writing in which voluntary euthanasia was conditionally accepted as a
humane way of dying.&quot 
<BR><BR>p.23 &quotThe Dutch healthcare system, unlike that of other countries, provides care for all citizens at a highly advanced level, without
exceptions.&quot 
<BR><BR>p.23 &quotMost people in the Netherlands die at home, being cared for by their general practitioner.&quot
<BR><BR>p.23: &quotTo investigate the practical matters of numbers and extent, in 1990 the government installed the Commission on the Study of
Medical Practice Concerning Euthanasia: the Remmelink Commission. 
<BR><BR>p.24: &quotSome adjectives used to designate a distinction, for example the terms active/passive and direct/indirect, are considered to be
confusing and are left behind as "stations passed." 
<BR><BR>p.24: &quotEuthanasia has come to be defined as "Intentionally taking the life of a person upon his or her explicit request by someone else
than the person concerned.&quot
<BR><BR>p.24: &quotWithin the law, the difference between acting and refraining from acting has no particular relevance, and this consideration took
precedence over the psychological experience of the difference. Passive euthanasia is self-contradictory because it concerns the
omission of a treatment to which the patient has not consented.&quot
<BR><BR>p.33 (Commentary Thomasma D pp31-33): &quotThe Dutch, unlike Americans, do not practice general medicine as strangers to patients and
their values. They are able to construct a value history for the patients who request euthanasia at the end of their lives.&quot

<BR><BR><BR><strong>Wal G, Dillman R. <cite>Euthanasia in the Netherlands.</cite></strong> British Medical Journal 1994; 308:1346-1349. 
<BR><BR>p.1346: &quotSince trustworthy empirical data have not been available until recently, moral viewpoints have coloured the estimated
numbers of cases of euthanasia (and assisted suicide) and the way in which it is practised. Recent reports, however, have diminished
this empirical uncertainty.&quot
<BR><BR>p.1346: &quot...euthanasia is defined as someone other than the patient intentionally ending the life of a patient at the patient's request.&quot
p.1346: &quotMany patients (40%) die at home, especially patinets with cancer (48% of all cancer deaths).&quot
<BR><BR>p.1346: &quotAlmost all patients (99.4%) have health care insurance, and 100% of the population is insured for the cost of protracted illness.
There are no financial incentives for hospitals, physicians, or family members to stop the care of patients. Moreover, the legal right of
patients to health care on the basis of their insurance will override budget and other financial agreements.&quot
<BR><BR>p.1347: &quot...euthanasia occurs at home in one of about 25 deaths, in hospitals in one out of 75, and in nursing homes in one out of 800.&quot
