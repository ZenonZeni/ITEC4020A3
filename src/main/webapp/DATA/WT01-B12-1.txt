</strong></font>Professional Compounding Pharmacy has been
producing &quot;custom made&quot; medications for over 45 years.
This pharmacy was originally founded by Donald K. Thompson in
1951 as the Nile Pharmacy in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Today the
Pharmacy is still a family owned business and is operated by
Donald&#146;s son Neil Thompson.<br>
<br>
In 1951 when Professional Compounding Pharmacy started, custom
compounding was an every-day practice. Pharmacists were trained
to tailor the Physician's prescribed medications to the needs of
individual's rendering these services. Now more then ever, people
are starting to appreciate and understand the importance of
having this type of service available to them. </p>

</strong></font><font size="3">The History of the Pharmacy and
Pharmacology dates back to the medieval times with priests, both
men and women, who ministered to the sick with religious rites as
well. Many peoples of the world continue the close association of
drugs, medicine, and religion or faith. Specialization first
occurred early in the 9th century in the civilized world around
Baghdad. It gradually spread to Europe as alchemy, eventually
evolving into chemistry as physicians began to abandon beliefs
that were not demonstrable in the physical world. Physicians
often both prepared and prescribed medicines; individual
pharmacists not only compounded prescriptions but manufactured
medicaments in bulk lots for general sale. Not until well into
the 19th century was the distinction between the pharmacist as a
compounder of medicines and the physician as a therapist
generally accepted.<br>

</strong><br>
phar·ma·cy (fär¹me-sê) noun<br>
plural phar·ma·cies<br>
Abbr. phar., Phar., pharm., Pharm.<br>
1. The art of preparing and dispensing drugs.<br>
2. A place where drugs are sold; a drugstore. In this sense, also
called apothecary.<br>
[Middle English farmacie, a purgative, from Old French, from
Medieval Latin pharmacìa, a medicine, from Greek pharmakeia, use
of drugs, from pharmakon, drug. <br>

<br>
<br>
The origin of the word &quot;pharmacy&quot; is generally ascribed
to the Greek pharmakon (&quot;remedy&quot;). It has been
suggested that there is a connection with the egyptian term
ph-ar-maki (&quot;bestower </font><img src="images/rxhist01.gif"
align="right" hspace="0" vspace="5" width="298" height="186"> <font
size="3">of security&quot;), which the god Thoth, patron of
physicians, conferred as approbation on a ferryman who had
managed a safe crossing. The notion of an Egyptian origin has a
certain romantic appeal, but in all likelihood the word
&quot;pharmacy&quot; and its many cognates derive, like so many
other scientific terms, from the Greek.<br>
<br>
As much as 80,000 years ago, people of the Paleolithic period
were interested in the flora around them to engrave a variety of
plants, bones and deer antlers. It is fruitless to try to
determine when Pharmaceutical practice started because Pharmacy
in a rudimentry form existed before the word.<br>
<br>
Combining different agents, or compounding, was considered an art
form practiced by Priests, and Doctors. The first known chemical
processes were carried out by the artisans of Mesopotamia, Egypt,
and China. Most of these craftspeople were employed in temples
and palaces, making luxury goods for priests and nobles. In the
temples, the priests especially had time to speculate on the
origin of the changes they saw in the world about them. Their
theories often involved magic, but they also developed
astronomical, mathematical, and cosmological ideas, which they
used in attempts to explain some of the changes that are now
considered chemical.</font><font size="4"><strong><br>

</strong>The first culture to consider these ideas scientifically
was that of the Greeks. From the time of Thales, about 600 BC,
Greek philosophers were making logical speculations about the
physical world rather than relying on myth to explain phenomena.
Thales himself assumed that all matter was derived from water,
which could solidify to earth or evaporate to air. His successors
expanded this theory into the idea that four elements composed
the world: earth, water, air, and fire. Democritus thought that
these elements were composed of atoms, minute particles moving in
a vacuum. Others, especially Aristotle, believed that the
elements formed a continuum of mass and therefore a vacuum could
not exist. The atomic idea quickly lost ground among the Greeks,
but it was never entirely forgotten. When it was revived during
the Renaissance, it formed the basis of modern atomic theory (see
Atom and Atomic Theory). <br>

modern pharmacist deals with complex pharmaceutical remedies far
different from the elixirs, spirits, and powders described in the
Pharmacopeia of London (1618) and the Pharmacopeia of Paris
(1639). In the U.S. today, major medicines, those regarded as
having the greatest therapeutic value, are selected for inclusion
in the Pharmacopeia of the United States, first published in
1820, by a Committee on Revision on which all colleges of
medicine and pharmacy, all state medical and pharmaceutical
associations, and the U.S. surgeon general are represented. After
the drugs have been chosen, the standards for quality and potency
are formulated by pharmacists and pharmaceutical chemists.
Similar criteria for drugs regarded by the committee as having
less therapeutic value are set forth in the National Formulary,
published by the American Pharmaceutical Association (founded
1852) since 1888. Any significant variation from pharmacopeia and
formulary standards may be prosecuted by the Food and Drug
Administration under the Pure Food and Drug Acts. <br>

Pharmacy, science of compounding and dispensing medication; also,
an establishment used for such purposes. Modern pharmaceutical
practice includes the dispensing, identification, selection, and
analysis of DRUGS. Pharmacy began to develop as a profession
separate from medicine in the 18th cent., and in 1821 the first
U.S. school of pharmacy was established in Philadelphia. <br>
<br>
Pharmacology (fär´me-kòl¹e-jê), study of the changes
produced in living animals by DRUGS, chemical substances used to
treat and diagnose disease. It is closely related to other
scientific disciplines, particularly BIOCHEMISTRY and PHYSIOLOGY.
Areas of pharmacologic research include mechanisms of drug
action, the use of drugs in treating disease, and drug-induced
side effects. <br>
<br>
Pharmacy, practice of compounding and dispensing drugs; also the
place where such medicinal products are prepared. Pharmacy is an
area of materia medica, that branch of medical science concerning
the sources, nature, properties, and preparation of drugs.
Pharmacists share with the chemical and medical profession
responsibility for discovering new drugs and synthesizing organic
compounds of therapeutic value. In addition, the community
pharmacist, or druggist, is increasingly called upon to give
advice in matters of health and hygiene.<br>
<br>

vspace="3" width="477" height="320"></font><font size="3">Education
and Practice <br>
In the U.S., colleges of pharmacy offer 5-year undergraduate
programs leading to the degree of bachelor of science in the
pharmaceutical sciences. All accept students directly from high
school and may grant advanced standing to college students or
graduates. Licenses are granted by states after the following
requirements have been met: graduation from one of the 72
colleges with programs accredited by the American Council on
Pharmaceutical Education; about 1500 hours of internship under a
registered pharmacist; satisfactory completion of a state
examination. Pharmacists may practice their profession in a
pharmacy located in a hospital, nursing home, or special area of
a drugstore. They may also be employed by a pharmaceutical
company in scientific research or the development and production
of new pharmaceutical products.<br>

size="3"><strong>EVOLUTION<br>
</strong>The rapid change from hand methods to machine methods of
production that characterized the Industrial Revolution found a
ready application in pharmacy, especially under the impact of the
scientific developments of the nineteenth century. Phytochemistry
and synthetic chemistry created new derivatives of old drugs and
new chemical entities of medicinal value that strained <img
src="images/rxhist3b.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="3"
width="474" height="300"></font><font size="3">the capacity of
the individual pharmacy. Large scale drug manufacturing had its
strong hold on society with the advent of machines and patents. <br>
The progress made by this new industry is demonstrated by the
catalogue of the American firm G.D. Searle, which by the late
1880&#146;s listed 400 fluid extracts, 150 elixirs, 100 syrups,
75 powdered extracts, and 25 tinctures and other drug forms.<br>

</strong>Industrialization had an impact on every aspect of the
activity of the pharmacist. First, it led to the creation of new
drugs, drugs that the individual pharmacist&#146;s own resources
could not produce. Second, many drugs that the individual
pharmacist was able to produce could be manufactured more
economically, and in superior quality, by industry. Third,
industry assumed responsibility traditionally vested in the
pharmacist for the quality of the medication. The plethora of
proprietary medicines, widely and often blatantly advertised,
deprived the pharmacist of a market for private specialties; it
forced the pharmacist to become a vendor of questionable
merchandise; it opened the way to much broader competition from
merchants, grocers and pitchmen than the pharmacist had
previously encountered.<br>

</strong>The nineteenth century did not see the end of the art of
compounding, but the art did give way, however grudgingly, to new
technology. It has been estimated that a &quot;broad knowledge of
compounding&quot; was still essential for 80 percent f the
prescriptions dispensed in the 1920s. <img
src="images/rxhist2b.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="2"
width="499" height="479"></font><font size="3">Although
pharmacists increasingly relied on chemicals purchased from the
manufacturer to make up prescriptions, there still remained much
to be done secundum Artem. They spread their own plasters,
prepared pills (of aloes and myrrh or quinine and opium, for
example), prepared powders of all kinds, and made up confections,
conserves, medicated waters, and perfumes. They put up tinctures
(of laudanum, paregoric, and colchicum) in five gallon demijohns.
And they frequently combined into a single dosage from several
medicines, which normally today would be written and dispensed as
separate prescriptions. Further more, they were often called upon
to provide first aid and medicines for such common ailments as
burns, frostbite, colic, flesh wounds, poisoning, constipation,
and diarrhea. <br>
In addition to maintaining a prescription laboratory, pharmacists
usually carried the disliked but necessary patent and proprietary
remedies along with herbs and locally popular nostrums of their
own compounding.<br>

</strong>The most notable change in pharmacy in modern times has
been the virtual disappearance of the preparation and compounding
of medicines. Whereas in the 1920s, 80 percent of the
prescriptions filled in American pharmacies required a knowledge
of compounding, by the 1940s the number of prescriptions
requiring compounding had declined to 26 percent. As far back as
1971, only 1 percent, or less, of all prescriptions combined two
or more active ingredients. Moreover, the pharmacist&#146;s
commitment to maintaining the quality of the drugs dispensed has
been reduced to knowing such facts as the length of shelf life
and the effect of exposure to light and judging the reliability
and reputations of the manufacture. <br>
<img src="images/rxhist11b.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"
vspace="3" width="504" height="281"></font><font size="3">All
this meant that the pharmacist&#146;s education and activities
had to undergo change. At the same time that the scientific
education of pharmacists was steadily becoming more demanding,
their role in the provision of health care was becoming more and
more circumscribed. Moreover, they were increasingly subject to
government and institutional requirements that diminished the
importance of the patient-pharmacist relation. And, especially in
the United States and Great Britain, competition from
prescription departments in chain and department stores tended to
demean both the role and the dignity of the pharmacist as a
health-care professional. The urban blight that attacked the
neighborhoods was inevitably a threat to the friendly
neighborhood pharmacist.<br>
The reaction to these conditions was apparent in the drop in the
production of graduates of American schools of pharmacy who were
planning to go into the field of community pharmacy. In 1947,
about 90 percent of graduates planned to go into some aspect of
community pharmacy; in 1973, that figure had dropped to 76.6
percent; in 1988 it stood at <img src="images/rxhist7b.jpg"
align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="300" height="423"></font><font

</strong>Custom Compounding pharmacies are on the rise.
Physicians, medical institutions and patients are realizing more
then ever the importance of tailoring an individuals medications
to specifically meet there needs. A majority of the Pharmacists
that are going back to compounding are doing so for the love of
the science and interest in the patients well being. Being able
to be in the role of a problem solver opens the doors to
creativity and genius that the medical industry has been eagerly
adopting for the last decade. </font><font size="4"><strong><br>
