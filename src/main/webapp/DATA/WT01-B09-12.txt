 - Rules Crimping California Propane Conversions
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 California — While propane-powered vehicles still hold the lead in counts of California’s alternative-fueled vehicles, some in the field say the state’s tough emissions rules are killing the propane conversion industry, reports Oxy-Fuel News. There are currently 45,000 propane-fueled vehicles in California, but the numbers are misleading, advocates say; almost all were in operation before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) tightened its rules in 1992. Conversion kit-makers are now required to pay CARB more than $200,000 per "engine family type" and submit vehicles to 100,000-mile durability tests, which may take as long as six months to complete. Because of various engine configurations, converters can spend millions of dollars to certify one engine size, said Bruce Eikelberger of Alternate Fuel Technology, a conversion company. CARB spokesman Alan Hearst said CARB’s goal is cleaner air; it should be up to the industry to find a way to make their kits meet the standards.

 - Nissan 1st Automaker to Offer Lithium-Battery EV
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Japan — Nissan has begun selling lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs) – but only in Japan, reports Kyodo News International. The automaker is the first in the world to offer an EV with the advanced batteries, which, on a pound-for-pound basis, have triple the energy storage of lead-acid batteries and reportedly last longer. Nissan intends to lease 30 Prairie Joy EVs annually, initially to local governments and corporations. Payments will be $259 (320,000 yen) per month for the three-year leases. The car, sometimes referred to as a "station wagon" and sometimes a "sport-utility vehicle," has a 124-mile range between charges. Sony Corp. helped develop the batteries. Honda is also offering EVs with advanced batteries, but its car uses nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries; lithium-ion batteries store 1.5 times the energy levels of NiMH batteries (News Notes 1/10, 6/18, 6/20, 8/6, 10/15, 11/14 and 12/13/96).

 - EPA – Rail Locomotives Must Clean Up Their Act
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C. — For the first time, railroad locomotives will be subject to air pollution rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, standards that will require emissions cuts of up to two-thirds, reports the Los Angeles Times. A typical locomotive puts out as many tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) – a chief ingredient of smog – as 2,000 passenger cars; 18,000 locomotives in the U.S. are responsible for 5 percent of the country’s air pollution. Beginning in 2001, railroads must gradually begin reducing emissions. By 2005, emissions must be cut 50 percent for hydrocarbons and particulates; 66 percent for NOx. Engine modifications are expected to raise engine costs by about 4 percent, according to EPA estimates. Because California’s air is the worst, the railroads have agreed to put the new engines – not yet engineered – in service there first.

 - GM’s Bi-Fuel NGV Pickup Launch Approaches
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Detroit — General Motors has officially announced details – such as price, availability and warranties – for the natural gas vehicle (NGV) pickups it will begin offering in spring 1997. The natural gas option on 1997 Chevrolet C2500 and GMC Sierra full-size pickups will be $5,800, but fuel-cost savings, income tax credits and gas-utility incentives will bring the cost down. Fully certified "factory package" bi-fuel pickups – that will run on either gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG) – will carry 3-year/36,000 mile "Bumper to Bumper Plus" warranties. The carbon-fiber-wrapped steel CNG tanks carry the equivalent of 13 gallons; a standard 34-gallon gasoline tank is also fitted. Production and installation of the natural gas systems will be done under the auspices of IMPCO Technologies (News Notes 1/15, 3/7, 4/11, 5/16, 6/14, 6/19, 7/3, 9/30 and 12/28/96).

 - Olympic Souvenir? How About an Electric Tram?
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Atlanta, Georgia — For souvenir hunters looking for 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta memorabilia, an offering by Georgia Power just might be a winner: The electric trams that shuttled athletes and coaches around the Olympic Village are now for sale, according to an Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA) press release. The 70 trams were used in 24-hour service, but only for 35 days until the games ended. More than 1.3 million passenger trips were logged, but the trams are still in excellent shape. Among the early buyers of the 36-passenger trams have been amusement and state parks, zoos, universities and a church. Each tow trailer, built by Tug Manufacturing, pulls three 12-passenger trailers built by Taylor-Dunn. More information may be obtained by contacting Georgia Power at (770) 216-1315.

 - Unique Mobility to Build a ‘Stealth Bus’ Drivetrain
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Golden, Colorado — Electric vehicle (EV) drive system-builder Unique Mobility has received a $1.23 million contract to supply an advanced electric drive system for an Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB), or "Stealth Bus." The 18-month contract is with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County Texas (Houston Metro), which is co-developing the bus along with Northrop Grumman Corp. and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Unique will produce a 107-kilowatt system that includes wheel motors with gear reduction, microprocessor controls and regenerative braking. The hybrid-electric bus uses advanced materials from military and aerospace applications to cut weight without sacrificing strength, hence its nickname. Last October, Northrop rolled out its first bus (News Notes 10/2/96 and 10/8/96).

 - Grand Canyon May Ban Cars, Use Alt-Fuel Buses
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Grand Canyon National Park — The National Park Service may ban nearly all cars from Grand Canyon National Park as part of its plan to get visitors into light-rail trains or alternative-fueled buses. Some 1.5 million tourist-filled cars enter the park each year, causing significant traffic – and smog that obscures canyon views (News Notes 5/30/96). The plan calls for electric buses or methanol-powered buses and light rail trains to cut 80 percent of the vehicle traffic. Those staying at hotels, camping in the park, or traveling on state Route 64 will still be allowed to drive; others will use a massive parking lot to be built outside the park. The proposal is part of a $350 million plan to improve the park for visitors, which numbered about 5 million last year.

 - L.A. Airport Solicits Bids for 39 Clean-Fuel Vehicles
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Los Angeles — Looking to expand its fleet of clean-air vehicles, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) officials are soliciting bids for 39 new alternative-fueled vehicles. The Department of Airports is looking to buy 10 liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered transit buses, eight bi-fuel pickup trucks, 16 bi-fuel sedans, and five police sedans powered only by compressed natural gas (CNG). The bi-fuel vehicles are to be capable of running on either gasoline or an alternative fuel. LAX already operates 21 buses on LNG; with another 6 already on order, 71 percent of its 52-bus fleet will operate on the cleaner-burning fuel. The remaining buses will later be converted to LNG. According to the request for bids, LAX estimates the vehicle costs at $300,000 per bus, $25,000 apiece for the bi-fuel vehicles and $30,000 for the CNG police cars.

 - 1,000 Mexico City Taxis to Become NGVs
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Mexico City — Penn Octane Corp. is expected to convert up to 1,000 of Mexico City’s taxis to compressed natural gas (CNG) as part of a wide-ranging agreement reached with private owners of public transportation companies there. It’s part of a package deal between four entities that includes a $90 million, 1,500-bus purchase through Penn Octane’s recently acquired bus dealership (News Notes 1/18/97), the taxi conversions, and CNG refueling stations to be owned and operated by Penn Octane. Taxi operator Sistema De Transportes En Taxis, S.A. de C.V. will also commit to long-term fuel purchases from Houston, Texas-based Penn Octane. About 70 percent of Mexico City’s air pollution – the world’s worst – comes from vehicles (News Notes 1/25/96, 3/14/96, 10/18/96 and 11/7/96). Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) produce 90 percent fewer emissions than conventional vehicles.

 - New Jersey Governor Orders 50 NGV Buses
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 New Jersey — New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman – marking a new direction for her state – will be directing the New Jersey Transit agency to begin replacing its diesel buses with natural gas-powered buses, reports the Tri-State Transportation Campaign’s newsletter. Whitman wants 50 "cruiser buses," or long- versus short-distance buses, and plans a fast-fueling terminal in Howell, Monmouth County, within two years as part of the $35 million project. Clean-air proponents say New Jersey had been reluctant – despite mounting evidence of diesel exhaust’s unhealthy effects – to do anything about the problem. Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) emit about 90 percent fewer emissions than diesel-powered models, and many fleets report fuel-cost savings of up to 40 percent (News Notes 8/20/96). To further cut emissions, the state is expanding its random roadside inspection program to include fines; more than 20 percent of vehicles tested failed.

 - Singapore’s Clean Air Stems From Permits, Taxes
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Singapore — Traffic jams – and air pollution – are rare in Singapore because of government policies including "permits" to own cars, stiff gasoline taxes and a toll system charging drivers $1.40 to enter downtown areas, reports Associated Press. In the 25-mile long island country, vehicle ownership is a privilege, not a right. Limited quantities of 10-year ownership permits sell at monthly auctions at prices up to $75,000; most go to dealers selling car-and-permit packages. Authorities also tax gasoline – to nearly $4.50 per gallon – and parking spaces to discourage stores and churches from offering free parking, while closed-circuit television systems monitor traffic flows and coordinate traffic signals. The nation of three million has 350,000 cars, one for every eight people; the rest use plentiful buses, taxis and a mass-transit rail system that covers much of the country. Singapore also plans to install electronic toll-collection systems on all of its major roads by the end of the year.

 - EPA Extends Smog-Plan Comment Deadline
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C. — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has extended – for 60 days – the public comment period for its proposed new rules on ozone and particulate air pollution, reports Reuters. The comment period had been set to close Feb. 18, but will now close April 18. The action means the publication of final rules will also be pushed back from June to August. While some groups – including oil industry lobbyists – say the proposed new rules would cost more than the benefits, doctors, health advocates and administration officials cite studies showing 20,000 American lives and billions of dollars in health costs would be saved each year (News Notes 11/25/96, 12/2/96, 1/15/97 and 1/21/97). The EPA’s toll-free comment line is 1-888-TELL EPA.

 - Pena Calls for Plan to Cut Oil Imports
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C. — Saying the country is sliding toward "energy insecurity," Energy Secretary nominee Federico Pena is calling for action to reduce the country’s dependence on oil imports, reports Reuters. "I believe that we will not reverse our slide toward energy insecurity without a set of strategies that address both energy production and consumption and that are coupled with specific targets and timetables to measure performance," Pena said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy Committee. His predecessor at the Department of Energy, Hazel R. O’Leary, said recently she believes "wake-up calls" such as price shocks will be needed to spur Americans to conserve energy and give more attention to alternative fuels (News Notes 1/20/97). More than half the oil consumed in the U.S. is imported; in May 1996, usage that month spiked to an average of 9.979 million barrels per day (News Notes 6/4/96 and 8/1/96).

 - Russian Scientists Develop Hydrogen Car Engine
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Moscow — Russian scientists have developed a hydrogen-powered automobile engine that produces only water vapor as exhaust, reports Xinhua. Citing the Rossiskaya Gazeta, the article says the hydrogen is stored in a tank that’s similar in size to a conventional gasoline tank, then reacts with oxygen in the air through "a special electrochemical dynamo." Electricity produced in the process is then used to power electric drive motors. The article – lean on details – doesn’t say if the system is operating in a vehicle or if the project is merely in the preliminary stages. Automakers worldwide are working on similar "fuel cell" projects: Daimler Benz showed its hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicle in May 1996 (News Notes 5/14/96); Toyota showed its version in October 1996 (News Notes 10/4/96); and last month Chrysler showed its system that will convert gasoline to hydrogen on-board the vehicle (News Notes 1/6/97).

 - Half of Berkeley’s School Buses to be NGVs in ‘97
</H3></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Berkeley, Calif. — The Berkeley Unified School District took delivery of two more natural gas-powered school buses this week as it proceeds with its plan to have half of its fleet running on the cleaner-burning fuel by the end of the year, reports the Alameda Times-Star. The $320,000 buses were paid for with a grant from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The school district – like many in the nation – is turning to natural gas because emissions are far less than from gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, and the refueling and maintenance costs are cheaper too (News Notes 8/20/96 and 1/9/97). Tulsa, Oklahoma’s school district saved $100,000 last year on fuel costs alone for its natural gas-powered buses.
