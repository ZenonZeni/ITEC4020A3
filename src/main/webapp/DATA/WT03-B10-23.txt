COMPUSERVE FORCED TO CENSOR

Officials at CompuServe Inc. scrambled last week to devise a way
to allow its 4 million members to regain access to more than 200
sexually explicit Internet newsgroups.  On Dec. 28, in response
to an order by the government of Germany, CompuServe suspended
access from its service to the controversial newsgroups,
spokeswoman Daphne Kent said.  German law enforcement told the
world's second-largest online service that the content of the
newsgroups was illegal under German law.

CompuServe subscribers worldwide, not just in Germany, are
affected by the action.  Kent would not speculate as to when, or
even if, access would be restored but said the company is "always
concerned" that blocking access to information could cost it
customers.  Kent said no other online service was similarly
restricted and said "we were likely targeted because of our
size."  Although smaller than its chief competitor, America
Online Inc.,  CompuServe has the greatest overseas presence of
any consumer online service.  In Germany it claims 100,000
members.  The number is insignificant, though, in comparison to
the more than 1.8 million individuals who use the Internet in
Germany and whose access to the same newsgroups is harder to
restrict, depending upon their method of access.

Kent said CompuServe is "looking at several options," among them
implementing a system that would restrict access to newsgroups by
region of the world and a "software solution" customized to abide
by each country's laws.

2MARKET, 2MARKET TO FIND A GREAT SALE

If fighting the post-holiday crowds in search of sales in the
shopping malls is not your idea of a bargain, perhaps 2Market
Inc.'s merchants' offering of after-Christmas merchandise online
is more what you had in mind.  A special sales area began Dec. 26
to give 2Market customers reduced prices at Greet Street
(greeting cards), Eddie Bauer (home and apparel), Chef's Catalog
(kitchen ware) and Windham Hill (holiday music CDs).  Access is
through the Marketplace area on America Online Inc. (AOL) or on
2Market's Holiday Edition CD-ROM.

Other merchants are expected to begin offering sale merchandise
through 2Market.  Valentine gifts will be available by the middle
of this month.  "Customers who may have waited in the past for
sale catalogs or a clearance sale at a retailer can now turn to
2Market for even more value and convenience," commented Tom Burt,
president and CEO of 2Market.

2Market's combination of CD-ROM and online technologies makes it
possible for shoppers with the CD-ROM (MMD 5/25/95) to connect
automatically to AOL, tap the online messages and receive price
updates, new products, special promotions and other vendor
information.  A professional gift expert is available to assist
with gift selections.  A CD-ROM can be ordered by calling 
1-800-622-6600 or from the 2Market area on AOL.  (2Market

SOFTKEY, LEARNING SAGA COMES TO CLOSE

After months of controversy, haggling, threats and lawsuits,
SoftKey International Inc. finally has completed its acquisition
of The Learning Co. pursuant to a merger agreement signed by the
two companies in early December (MMD 12/8/95).  Approximately 95
percent of the outstanding shares of Learning stock, or 7.7
million shares, were purchased for $67.50 per share in cash as
payment for the company on Dec. 22, and the merger of Learning
into a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftKey was completed late last
Wednesday.

Learning originally had resisted SoftKey's courtship - which
began last October with a cash-and-stock offer worth $606 million
(MMD 10/31/95) - because it already was in merger talks with
Broderbund Software Inc., but also because Learning felt it would
not be able to realize its full market potential under ownership
by SoftKey, a company in whose business philosophy it had little
faith.  But money talks, and a sweetened offer by SoftKey (MMD
12/5/95) led Learning's board of directors to change their tune
and accept the new bid.

SoftKey also has closed a previously announced deal with Tribune
Co. to merge the latter's Compton's NewMedia Inc. and Compton's
Learning Company (different from The Learning Co.) units into
SoftKey (MMD 12/1/95).  As part of the deal, SoftKey last week
tendered 4.5 million shares of its common stock in exchange for
both Compton's companies, which now operate as wholly owned
subsidiaries.  SoftKey also issued 587,036 additional shares to
Tribune last Thursday to cancel $14 million of intercompany debt,
and also executed a promissory note to cancel $3 million of such
debt.

AOL, COMPUSERVE:  5M IN EARLY 1996

Amrica Online Inc. (AOL) announced last week that its number of
subscribers has surpassed 4.5 million.  The announcement came
less than a week after CompuServe Inc. announced that it now has
4 million subscribers.  Both companies said they expect to be
serving 5 million subscribers in the near future - AOL "early in
the new year," and CompuServe "next spring."

"New computer owners are realizing the value of the online
service and the Internet," said Bob Massey, CompuServe's
president and CEO.  "A computer that is not connected to
cyberspace is like a television without sound and color." 
CompuServe said it is adding 200,000 new members to its service
every month.

AOL, for its part, has tripled its subscribership since a year
ago, when it had just over 1.5 million members.  "Not only are
consumers in the United States showing a strong preference for
AOL as their means of access to the Internet and the world of
online services, but initial response to GNN, our new Internet-
only service ... has been gratifying," said Steve Case, chairman
and CEO of the company.

Although AOL has a larger subscriber base in the United States,
CompuServe has a larger international base.  Last month,
CompuServe announced that it had reached the 500,000 subscriber
mark in Europe (MMD 12/22/95), and that it intends to double that
number in the next year.  But AOL is expanding internationally as
well.  In late November it launched service in Germany in
partnership with Bertelsmann AG (MMD 11/29/95), and intends to
take France, the United Kingdom and Japan online during 1996.

DAVIC ADOPTS GLOBAL STANDARDS

The Digital Audio-Visual Council (DAVIC) has finalized its first
set of global technical standards for "end-to-end" digital
multimedia systems and now will focus on adding specifications
for cable modems.  In the future, DAVIC will tackle the
development of standards for video servers, 3-D animation, high-
quality video and sound, and network interfaces in the home, a
DAVIC spokesman said.

The new "DAVIC 1.0" standards, which allow for content and
hardware interoperability, were adopted Dec. 16 in Berlin at the
end of a weeklong series of meetings involving about 400 DAVIC
representatives.  The International Telecommunication Union is
expected to ratify the standards this month.      DAVIC is a
coalition of communications and entertainment companies that is
creating voluntary standards for digital audio and visual
services.  Council officials said earlier this year that the
first set of standards would be adopted in December (MMD
9/19/95).

The new standards will enable equipment manufacturers to develop
network hardware without having to worry about whether their
product conforms to proprietary standards, the spokesman said. 
In addition, programmers will be able to convert existing content
- or develop new content - according to uniform specifications
for digital systems.  The spokesman emphasized that the DAVIC
standards process will be an "ongoing" effort, with additional
specifications incorporated periodically into the standards.  The
council's "highest priority" now is to develop cable modem
specifications for "DAVIC 1.1," he said.  DAVIC is working in
conjunction with Cable Television Laboratories Inc. to develop
those specifications.

In the coming months, DAVIC also plans to develop specifications
for Internet access, system security, return channels for
satellite TV transmission, and "modulation schemes" for wireless
cable TV service, the spokesman said.  Such specifications would
be added as "building blocks" to existing DAVIC standards, he
stressed.  DAVIC's next meetings will be held in Seoul, South
Korea, in March and New York City in June.  In addition, a
special May meeting is being planned to discuss "more rapid
consideration of [cable] modems," the spokesman said.

NEWS IN BRIEF

New York City was the place to be for cybergeeks on New Year's
Eve.  Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) hosted a party
at Club Expo in Manhattan, featuring a Sony PlayStation
competition that let partygoers play new video games and compete
for prizes.  The bash was broadcast by the city's 102.7 WNEW-FM
radio station and occasionally simulcast on Sony's Jumbotron
screen in Times Square - where Total New York Inc. and Pipeline
New York were hosting their own party - "the wildest online party
yet" - on Total's Web site.  Parties in Times Square and the
Knitting Factory ("the only club in New York with a live T1
connection") were "cybercast" on http://www.totalny.com and
hosted by Aliza "Cybergrrl" Sherman.  (Sony 415-655-8047; Total
212-620-6100)

In a newly published book - Bill Gates: The Robber Baron of
Cyberspace - author Anthony Martin, executive director of the
Committee to Fight Microsoft Corp., provides an antidote to
Gates' vision of the future (MMD 11/29/95).  "Gates' world is one
in which ordinary Americans are monitored relentlessly," said
Martin at a press conference last week.  "My book ... exposes the
truth behind Microsoft Corp. and its drug-crazed culture....  Mr.
Gates may have fooled some of the people some of the time, but he
will not be allowed to fool all of the people all of the time." 
That's tellin' 'em!  (Martin 212-879-0086)

At first it looked as if the computers would win, but on Day 2 of
the Harvard Cup Human Versus Computer Chess Challenge the humans
staged a comeback and grandmasters Joel Benjamin and Michael
Rhode emerged victorious.  The top-scoring computer games were I-
Motion Interactive's "Virtual Chess" and "Chessmaster 4000 for
Windows 95" from Mindscape Inc., the principal sponsor of the
competition.  (Mindscape 305-321-6334)

Demand for 16-bit video games and video game players was greater
this holiday season than it was for the newer 32-bit platforms,
according to the Wall Street Journal.  Executives from companies
such as Nintendo of America Inc. and Sega of America Inc. were
quoted as admitting they could have done more to prepare for what
could have been a windfall season for them, had they not run out
of 16-bit products.  It seems the newer games simply couldn't
compete with the price and installed base of 16-bit machines.  Go
figure.  (Sega 213-782-6600, http://www.segaoa.com; Nintendo
