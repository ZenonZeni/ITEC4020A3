<B>Minister Announces Next Steps in Wabakimi Park Expansion
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced a final public review  of the proposed boundary for the expansion to Wabakimi Provincial Park in Northwestern Ontario.<P>
 
"I'm committed to expanding Wabakimi Provincial Park as soon as possible," Mr. Hodgson said.  "To finish the process of park expansion, we want a final review of the proposed boundary for the park."<P>

MNR is seeking public input into the proposed new boundary for Wabakimi  Provincial Park.  The proposal is to add more than 700,000 hectares to the  existing Wabakimi Wilderness Park which is 155,000 hectares.  At close to  900,000 hectares, this provincial park would be the largest provincial park  within the forested region of Ontario, and the second biggest provincial park in the province, the largest being Polar Bear Provincial Park.<P>
 
 This area is well known for its ecological features and recreational  opportunities. The proposal to expand the park builds on the recommendations of  a boundary review committee that represented local interests.<P>

MNR's proposal to expand Wabakimi will create an extensive protected area with no mining, timber harvesting and hydroelectric development. The permitted uses recommended for the park recognize the importance of protecting the environment while encouraging recreation and related economic activity, particularly tourism.<P>

Ministry staff will work with Aboriginal communities adjacent to the proposed  new boundary on arrangements that will see their traditional uses of the area continues.<P> 

MNR has developed an information package on the boundary proposal that is available through Ontario's Environmental Registry.  Copies are also available through the MNR's Northwest Regional office.  The deadline for comments is January 31, 1997.<P>

Following the public review and park regulation, the park management planning process will begin. There will be more public involvement during the park management planning stage.<P>
