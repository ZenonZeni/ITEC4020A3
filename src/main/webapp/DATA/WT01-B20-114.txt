    <p>re: Case No. FECR047575 State of Iowa v. Helmers, Allen

</blockquote>

<p>People's Representative, U.S. <a
href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/harkin01.html"> Senator Harkin</a>, I am
a Federal Prisoner at the U.S. Pentitentiary at Lewisburg,
PA.&nbsp; I am serving a 35-year sentence for Conspiracy to
Import and Conspiracy to Possess Marijuana.&nbsp; In 1972 I
visited one of your predecessors to the United States Senate, the
Honorable <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html"> Harold Hughes</a>.&nbsp;
The subject of our discussion at that time was the religious use
and the sacramentality of the herb commonly known as
marijuana.&nbsp; After a brief discussion of approximately one
half hour, the former <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html">
Senator Hughes</a> cancelled his schedule for the following
afternoon and spent that entire afternoon discussing all manner
of subject matter as diverse as the possible spiritual properties
of marijuana and ranging to his possible dark horse candidacy for
the Presidency of the United States.&nbsp; I was accompanied by
two colleagues, Thomas Reilly, who later became known nationally
as <a href="../tropic.html"> Brother Louv</a> - the spokesman for
the <a href="../coptic.html"> Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church</a>,
and Jacob Shnurman who is presently living in Des Moines and
employed in some capacity by the State of Iowa.&nbsp; I mention
this previous encounter simply to indicate to you that I have a
long and storied experience with this controversial herb and I do
possess the credentials of an herb man. However, the purpose of
this letter is not for myself nor is it an attempt to enlighten
you concerning the spiritual properties of this &quot;plant of
renown.&quot;&nbsp; I am writing you at the behest of my good
friend of many years, Carl Olsen, in behalf of a man I do not
know at all, <a href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Allen
D. Helmers</a>. I am sure that you are aware of the plight of <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Mr. Helmers</a>.&nbsp;
He is attempting to petition for relief from the very real pain
which he suffers daily from the physical debility that he
acquired from breaking his back, initially, and, subsequently,
from a traffic accident caused by an alcohol-impaired driver. Is
there no one within the government at any level in these United
States who possesses the human compassion to hear the cry of
these helpless and hopeless folks who are suffering each
day?&nbsp; Isn't there anyone to speak in these legislative halls
of mischief for the souls who claim that their pain is either
relieved or more tolerable when they puff some smoke from a plant
which has been a part of creation long before pharmaceutical
manufacturers or drug enforcement operatives worked their
diabolical sciences and created the propaganda that has maligned
the most beneficial plant on this planet?&nbsp; Is there anyone
who is not brainwashed by this vicious lie about marijuana or who
is not afraid of the ominous repercussions of a federal
bureaucracy that thoroughly intimidates those it purports to
serve? I do not see anyone whose motives have not been
compromised by the political process.&nbsp; Human suffering is
the least of concerns by this juggernaut that has no
feelings.&nbsp; How is it that these people who claim to
represent the people can ignore the sincere cries of medical
relief that arise from thousands of suffering souls who have
risked the fearsome tactics of law enforcement agencies to
medicate themselves and then risk retribution when they are
honest? Lord, how long will thou look on?&nbsp; Let your
conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Everyone is accountable for their
actions. With minimal hope, I remain your brother, <a
