Dear Mom and Dad:<BR>

<P>
Exciting news! Today Candy Mentz, one of the VPs around here, asked me to sit in on a meeting for this new product called No!Ware. Granted, she only wanted me to take notes, but the prospect was a lot more interesting than making coffee, which is what I mostly did until the FBI confiscated the coffee maker. <BR>

<P>
Anyway, during the meeting, Victor Gooseggi--a brilliant developer who's from Hoezbagistan (sorry Dad, I know you don't like to be reminded about bailing me out of jail at 3 in the morning)--pointed at me and said, &quot;We need perspective of spring chicken to this place. Which road is No!Ware going in your mind?&quot; <BR>

<P>
You would have been proud of me!! I told them Silicon Fusion has a corporate responsibility to ensure that in the new information age, people aren't polarized into haves and have nots. Candy looked displeased, but Victor said I had &quot;hit the pail with the bread,&quot; which I took as a compliment. He also put me in charge of what he called the &quot;Disadvantaged Outreachment for Differently Unabled Usability Testing and Enfranchisement of All the World's Peoples Committee.&quot; I'm still a little unclear on what he has in mind, but I'm excited anyway.<BR>

<P>
Not too much else to report. I haven't heard from Clive in weeks. I hate to say it Mom, but maybe you were right about him.<BR>

<P>
Hope you both are doing well! Write soon--and since I don't get my first check for a couple of weeks, any extra $$ you could send would be appreciated!! <BR>

<P>
Love ya!! xxoo<BR>
