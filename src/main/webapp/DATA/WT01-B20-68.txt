<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Dutch Justice Minister Wants
to &quot;Regulate&quot; Marijuana Supply</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a January 21 interview with the Dutch newspaper <i>De
Volkskrant</i> (The People's Newspaper) published in The Hague,
the capital of The Netherlands, the Dutch Minister of Justice, Mrs.
Winnie Sorgdrager, said she wants to &quot;regulate the supply of
cannabis products&quot; being sold in more than 1,300 coffeeshops
around the country. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article explained that Sorgdrager is following her party's
opinion &quot;that the current policy allowing retail sale of
marijuana and hashish has to have its <u>logical sequel in
arranging the supply of the products...&quot;</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dutch policy is that &quot;the sale of cannabis products at
the 'frontdoor' of the coffeeshops is tolerated by the Justice
ministry but the supply at the 'back door', or even more, large
scale production, are strictly prohibited.&nbsp; Criminals have
therefore taken over that part of the market.&quot;&nbsp; Sorgdrager
said that she believes that &quot;we have to dispose of this
hypocrisy about that back and front door.&quot;&nbsp; She is
working with her colleagues in the Health Ministry on a Drug
Report to be issued this summer. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Most of the hashish sold is still imported (smuggled in), but
most of the marijuana is now grown in the Netherlands.&nbsp; The
smuggling is especially dominated by violence-prone gangs from
North Africa and Lebanon.&nbsp; The article goes on to explain
that &quot;Sorgdrager is seriously considering a division and
regulation of the cannabis market....&quot; separating the
domestic cannabis from imported hashish smuggled in by criminals
from abroad.&nbsp; The objective is to create a means of
supplying the Dutch market while preventing exports. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch have followed the current policy for many years, so
if there were any serious social or individual health problems
associated with cannabis use, it would have become obvious by now.&nbsp;
It is also worth noting that, until recently, most of the
cannabis consumed was imported hashish which is much more potent
than most marijuana.&nbsp; This means that the &quot;new potent marijuana&quot;
line pushed by the DEA has no relevance to the Dutch experience
or to the supposed threat posed to America by the average
marijuana consumed today which -- according to the U.S. National
Institute on Drug Abuse -- is between 3 and 4%, far below the
average for hashish. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article also explained that Sorgdrager does not want to
use the terms &quot;liberalization&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot;
but prefers to use the term &quot;regulation.&quot;&nbsp; The
Dutch have long been pressured by France, Belgium and the United
States to arrest marijuana users, but the Germans, Swiss and others
in Europe are moving toward the Dutch model.&nbsp; The Dutch
policy generally is to try to reduce the level of violence in
their country, which nationwide has about half as many murders as does
Washington, D.C., alone.&nbsp; Amsterdam is slightly larger than
Washington, but has less than one tenth the number of murders. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On January 12th, NORML carried an exclusive report on the
protests by the Dutch government to the United States concerning
misrepresentations by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
regarding Dutch drug policies and their social
consequences.&nbsp; The DEA has not yet responded.&nbsp; The
statement by the Dutch Justice Minister has also been ignored by
the American media, while <i><u>The Wall Street Journal</u></i>
ran an editorial today entitled &quot;Eighth Grade
Potheads.&quot;&nbsp; If the editorial's hysteria was well
founded The Netherlands should resemble the United States, Bosnia,
or some other violence ridden society and should have a very high
rate of marijuana use and hard drug addiction.&nbsp; <u>Just the
opposite is the case.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While American prohibitionists commonly claim that &quot;the
Dutch legalized drugs and it did not work,&quot; in fact all
drugs remain illegal in The Netherlands.&nbsp; As is the case in
the U.S., most Dutch &quot;drug related&quot; violence is the
result of prohibition, not of the drugs themselves -- except for
alcohol -- again as in the U.S.&nbsp; While it is Dutch policy to
tolerate the small scale sale and possession of cannabis, -- and
no one is arrested for the possession of personal amounts of any
other drug -- the sale of hard drugs is vigorously
prosecuted.&nbsp; Any &quot;cannabis coffeeshop&quot; which is
suspected of selling hard drugs is closed immediately.&nbsp; <u>One
of the primary objectives of the &quot;coffeeshop&quot; policy is
to separate cannabis from the hard drugs.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This policy has been very successful, hence the DEA opposition
to it. Maintaining the connection between marijuana and hard
drugs is a vital component of U.S. drug policy.&nbsp; This is the basis
for the claims that marijuana is a &quot;stepping stone&quot;,
&quot;threshold&quot;, &quot;gateway&quot; to using other drugs.&nbsp;
The success of Dutch policy demonstrates that this is just the
opposite of the truth, so the Dutch policy must be misrepresented
until they can be pressured into merging the drug markets through
blanket prohibition as has been done in the U.S. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In fact, very few marijuana users in America ever become hard
drug users, but the ratio is even lower in The Netherlands.&nbsp;
Ironically, <u>marijuana use by Dutch teenagers is much lower
than in the U.S.&nbsp; Over 30% of U.S. high school seniors have
used marijuana in the last year, while only 12% of Dutch 18 year
olds have ever used cannabis</u>.&nbsp; It is Dutch policy to
strongly discourage teenage cannabis use through honest drug
education that is credible and effective -- because it does not exaggerate
in order to frighten politicians, editorialists and other
impressionable subgroups. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, announced today
that NORML will begin a program to encourage American opinion
leaders -- and ordinary citizens -- to visit The Netherlands to
see for themselves the success of Dutch cannabis policy.&nbsp;
&quot;When Americans ask what would happen if we legalized
marijuana, they don't have to use their imaginations to find
out.&nbsp; They can just use their passports.&nbsp; Americans
certainly don't need to go to Holland to get marijuana, but they
should go to Holland to be reminded of what we all used to know:
FREEDOM WORKS.&quot; </p>
