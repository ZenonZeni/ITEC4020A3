<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h3>

<p> Despite the demonstrated relationships between drug abuse and
crime, criminal justice agencies too seldom focus on reducing
drug abuse as a means of reducing the criminal activities of
drug-involved offenders. Yet evidence from the research
literature continues to accumulate, indicating that some drug
treatment programs have been successful in reducing recidivism.
Following an overview of pertinent research findings, this paper
outlines the elements of an effective strategy for treating
cocaine and heroin abusing offenders. </p>

<p> The interventions proposed in this paper grow out of the drug
abuse research literature, the authors' urban-based research, and
their clinical expcriencc with drug abuse treatment in
corrections. In addition, the suggested interventions emerge from
years of correctional outcome research which has assessed what
works, with whom, and under what circumstances. Although this
paper will focus on heroin and cocaine involved offenders, some
recommendations may apply to offenders who use other illicit
drugs. </p>

<h3><a name="ResearchFindings">Research findings</a> </h3>

<h4><a name="TheProblem">The problem </a></h4>

<p> Recent research provides amplc evidence that offender
populations are composed of large numbers of drug abusers-and
that drug-involved offenders commit substantial number-, of
undetected crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Very recent cocaine and heroin abusers constitute a
majority of the arrestees and inmates in jails and prisons in New
York City and some other jurisdictions.</b> </p>

<p> National surveys of jail and prison populations, smaller
self-report studies, and urine testing results indicate that
increasing proportions of offenders are users of drugs and that
cocaine use is increasing the most rapidly. More than
three-quarters of the nation's inmates and almost all inmates in
New York City report illicit drug use.' Similarly, sclf-rcport
studies among prison and jail inmates in California, Michigan,
and Texas reveal that approximately half are heroin users and
many are daily heroin users.' Recent urinalysis-based studies of
arrestees in Washington, D.C. reveal that well over half test
positive for at least one illicit drug and a quarter test
positive for two or more illicit drugs, In a recent Manhattan
study the level of co caine use had doubled .;ince 1984.
Eighty-three percent of arrestees in September and October 1986
tested positive for cocaine, compared with 42 percent in 1984;
the increase in cocaine was found at all age levels and for all
offenses. Comparable increases have also been reported in
Washington, DC. </p>

<p> <b>Frequent users of heroin and cocaine in the general
population exhibit </b>a <b>multiproblem lifestyle that may
include a pattern of persistent criminal behavior.</b> </p>

<p> Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing condition that is part
of a complex multiproblem lifestyle which is highly resistant to
rehabilitation. Several studies show that daily or near daily
heroin users-many of whom also use other illicit substances
daily-are not in treatment, and do not seek treatment. Many also
consume alcohol heavily. They average over 200 non-drug crimcs
and hundreds of drug distribution offenses annually, yet are
unlikely to be arrested more than once a year, and then spend
less than a month in incarceration, The majority commit many
crimes for which they are not arrested or incarcerated, but
because of sheer volume of activity, they still have many more
arrests and incarceration periods than non-drug offenders. Over
half their generally modest income comes from drug distribution
activities. They usually spend most of that income on drugs.
Daily heroin abusers also generally do not have a residence nor
make their own meals, but rather stay and eat with a relative or
friend. They do not receive or seek public assistance. They have
no legal employment during a typical week nor do they seek any.
Thus, they are typically an economic burden on the poorest
members of their low-income communities. Many aspects of their
lifestyle also put them at high risk for violence and many other
social and health problems such as AIDS, alcoholism, and TB.
Therefore, whatever treatment programming is applied to this
population, it must contend with all or most of these problems if
it is to achieve long-term changes in this lifestyle.' </p>

<p> Data about chronic cocaine users' crime rates are not as well
developed. Recent evidence from street and treatment setting
interviews with crack users indicate that about 60 percent admit
paying for their cocaine with money derived from illicit
sources-ranging from drug dealing and prostitution to theft and
robbery. The persons using cocaine, however, generally come from
more varied socioeconomic backgrounds than heroin users, their
lifestyles vary accordingly, and many do not ever get arrested.
Nevertheless, the lifestyles of cocaine abusers who do become
involved with the criminal justice system appear to be very
similar to those of heroin abusers, as cocaine users often also
use heroin. </p>

<h4><a name="CriminalJusticeResponse">The criminal justice
response </a></h4>

<p> While much remains to be learned about the precise nature of
the links betnveen doing drugs and doing crime, the two behaviors
are clearly associated. Yet criminal justice agencies have few
strategies for routinely detecting and intervening in the drug
use of arrested heroin and cocaine abusers. The justice system
focuses almost exclusively on its criminal processing functions
of arrest, adjudication, probation, incarceration, and parole.
Even these interventions often represent a limited intrusion on
the criminal activities of the drug abusing offender. </p>

<p> <b>Criminal justice agencies, with rare exceptions, do not
seek or use information about the drug use of persons who are
arrested or convicted of crimes.</b> </p>

<p> Littlc cffort is made to identify drug abusers, to record
information about their drug use, to provide treatment (other
than dctoxification) while in jail or prison, to refer them to
treatment programs in the community, or to use such information
in plea bargaining or case dispositions (where legally
appropriate). <b>Only </b>a few jurisdictions maintain any
information about the drug use of arrestees or convicted
offenders, and there is a strong likelihood that the drug
information in their records is both incomplete and inaccurate
because it is most often based on self-report and not
substantiated through urinalysis. Thus, information that could
help inform criminal justice processing is not generally
available.' </p>

<p> <b>To the extent that criminal sanctions are applied, their
ability to interrupt the life style of the vast majority of
cocainc-heroin abusers is minimal.</b> </p>

<p> Nationally, only a low percentage (less than 10 percent) of
all felony arrests lead to a felony conviction resulting in
incarceration. Over half of all felony arrests (60 percent in
Manhattan) lead to conviction, but there is much variation by
jurisdiction. Typically, offenders plead guilty to lesser charges
and are sentenced to time served, a fine, community service,
probation, or a few months in jail. Consequently, the vast
majority of offenders, mainly those arrested on less severe
felony and misdemeanor charges, are at liberty within three
months after arrest. In addition, many felony offenders (a
significant portion of whom are involved with drugs) are at
liberty on bail or on personal recognizance while awaiting trial.
Active heroin-cocaine users have higher failure-to-appear rates
and much higher rates of rearrest while out on bail than
offenders not involved with drugs.9 </p>

<h4><a name="EfficacyofCriminalSanctions">The efficacy of
criminal sanctions </a></h4>

<p> Little evidence is available that criminal justice sanctions
alone are as effective as drug treatment in reducing the drug use
and criminality of cocaineheroin abusers at liberty. The central
value of the criminal process may lie in the leverage that can be
exerted to bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment. </p>

<p> <b>Existing evidence does not show that criminal justice
sanctions (fine, probation, or parole, or length of time served)
reduce criminality or drug </b>use <b>more effectively than drug
treatment among cocaine-heroin abusers.</b> </p>

<p> It is not known whether or to what extent jail or prison time
alone suppresses post-incarceration criminality or cocaine-heroin
abuse among drug involved offenderq- The limited evidence
available suggests that two-thirds or <b>more </b>of arrested
heroin abusers return to heroin-cocaine use and their diverse
criminal patterns within three months after release from
detention. In contrast, several studies of drug treatment
outcomes with criminal justice clients (mainly probationers) show
substantial post-treatment reductions in both drug use and
criminality.10 Outpatient clients in methadone treatment report
less than half as much criminal activity as heroin abusers not in
treatment. Compared with their pretreatment criminality,
methadone clients report 50 to 80 percent less crime during
treatment.&quot; Even among those who continue criminal activity
during treatment, methadone clients report reduced involvement in
serious crimes such as robbery, burglary, or dealing of heroin or
cocaine; they report mainly low-level property crimes, con games,
and sale of marijuana or pills.&quot; </p>

<p> Residential drug programs have sizable proportions
(frequently over half) of clients who are on probation or parole
or under related <b>legal </b>pressure, and whose criminality is
near zero while in the residential program. This nearzero
criminality of cocaine-heroin abusers while in residential
programs is documented for therapeutic communities in several
cities. A study of treatment facilities in New York found that
about a third of residential clients were criminal justice
referrals and had extensive criminal histories. These clients
tended to stay longer and have as good or better outcomes than
clients with similar pretreatment criminal and drug abuse
histories who were not referred by the criminal justice system.
13 </p>

<p> <b>The coercive power, surveillance potential, and time
offcmd through criminal justice sanctions, open significant
opportunities for effectively treating cocaine-heroin abusers.</b>
</p>

<p> Although criminal justice sanctions alone may have uncertain
value in reducing the criminality of drug involved offenders,
those sanctions can serve a powerful role by facilitating
effective drug treatment. There are a variety of pressures that
bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment: parents, employers,
loved one, and friends may all apply psychological and social
pressures. The most powerful pressure, however, may be the threat
of legal sanction -- the threat of arrest and conviction, and
most importantly, the threat of incarceration. The leverage
created by this threat, and by the sanction itself, permits
treatment to be considered as a viable option by serious abusers.
Moreover, by reducing early program termination, it allows the
treatment and aftercare to continue for the length of the
permissable custody. </p>

<p> Cocaine-heroin abusers typically wish to avoid the
&quot;hassles&quot; associated with changing their lives. When
the alternative is lengthy incarceration, cocaine-heroin abusers
may be more willing to be referred to drug treatment. If,
however, the alternative is a short sentence, detainees and jail
inmates may prefer the incarceration rather than diversion to
long-term drug abuse treatment. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, relatively few offenders voluntarily seek
treatment. Many offenders are referred by the criminal justice
system to drug treatment as the result of negotiated plea
bargains in which the offender agrees to enter treatment instead
of receiving a substantial sentece. For many years TASC
(Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime) has operated in selected
jurisdictions to recruit clients and negotiate with court staff
for release of offenders to drug programs. TASC clients are more
likely to select treatment because the alternative is considered
more onerous. </p>

<p> Few cocaine-heroin abusers in custody volunteer for drug
treatment unless the treatment program is seen as an attractive
alternative. Prison inmates seek out in-house treatment programs
because they often provide better living conditions, a safer
environment, parole release considerations, and an opportunity to
possibly change one's lifestyle. In-prison programs that offer
such conditions are substantially better able to recruit
participants than those which do not. Although these offenders
may not be completely sincere at admission, there is an
opportunity for the program to engage them in an effective
treatment experience. In short, the threat of substantial
sanctions (for arrestees) or the promise of better in-prison
conditions (for those in custody) can operate as extremely useful
incentives for treatment. Nevertheless, it must be understood
that a significant portion of offenders who have long chronic
heroin or cocaine abuse patterns will not want treatment under
any circumstances. </p>

<h4><a name="Somedimensions">Some dimensions of effective drug
abuse treatment.</a> </h4>

<p> As the preceding section has demonstrated, the criminality of
heroin abusers is substantially reduced while they are receiving
some form of treatment. The experiences of effective programs
suggest that whatever treatment method is used must have a sound
theoretical and empirical basis for its implementation.
Additionally, the treatment method must emerge from a powerful
social restoration tradition (discussed further below) that is
capable of teaching offenders to interact with others in less
deviant, more socially acceptable ways. Such an approach must be
credible to participants and not be perceived to be coercive and
authoritarian. The approach must have the capability to convince
offenders that the demanding path to a socially acceptable
lifestyle is worthwhile despite their deprived backgrounds, their
experience with quick criminal profits, and their recognition
that there is a low probability they will be caught for their
crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Despite the often cited conclusion that &quot;nothing
works&quot;, evidence from the research literature continues to
accumulate that some programs have been successful in reducing
recidivism.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> The majority of successful programs have been based on a
social learning theory of criminal behavior.&quot; According to
this theory, criminal behavior is learned through a process of
social interaction with others. Thus, pro-social behaviors must
be learned to replace deviant behavior. Effective approaches
include: therapeutic communities, self-help groups, family
therapy, contingency contracting, role playing and modeling,
vocational and social skills training, training in interpersonal
cognitive problem-solving skills, and other programs involving
ongoing peer monitoring of participants' behavior.&quot; </p>

<p> Successful programs have several things in common: authority
structures that clearly specify rules and sanctions,
anti-criminal modeling and reinforcement of pro-social behavior,
pragmatic personal and social problemsolving assistance, program
staff knowledgeable about the use of community resources, and
relationships between staff and clients which are empathic and
characterized by open communication and trust. Ex-offender-addict
counselors who serve as credible role-models of successful
rehabilitation also are often utilized.&quot; The &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A) provides an example of a
successful program that employs these treatment principles. </p>

<p> Conversely, unsuccessful programs are frequently based on a
medical (disease) model of criminology which suggests that
criminal behavior is a sickness.'9 <b>Similarly, </b>intervention
programs based on deterrence models (e.g., &quot;Scared
Straight&quot;) have shown very limited effects and have even
been associated with increased offending.&quot;' Other types of
programs that have been unsuccessful include those that rely
solely on open communication, &quot;friendship&quot; models,
inmate-directed therapy groups, and those that are
non-directive.,, </p>

<p> While inmate-dircctcd therapy groups have not had a record of
success, behavioral programs that are simply imposed-without
involving inmates in their development-do not appear to work
either. Such programs are often focused on anti-social rather
than pro-social behaviors and as a result give undue attention
and reinforcement to negative behavior. Other features of
unsuccessful programs include the failure to either neutralize or
utilize the inmate's peer group and failure to sustain continuity
of care after release from prison. 22 </p>

<p> A number of factors have been identified that degrade
treatment integrity23 and impede treatment success. Many are
common to intervention pro grams in any setting. The absence of
sound theoretical basis for treatment is a typical obstacle to
the development of successful programs. Often, the quality and
intensity of treatment interventions are inadequate. Sometimes
programs propose treatment interventions that are based on sound
principles which are not followed when the program is
implemented. Another common problem is lack of staff training and
treatment experience, and/or their inadequate commitment to.both
the clients' and program success. </p>

<p> Other impediments to the establishment and maintenance of
successful treatment programs are related to a lack of
correctional system support and the negative influence of inmate
subcultures. Fundamental differences between custodial and
treatment perspectives often contribute to the failure of the
correctional environment to support program staff and goals, The
lack of support from the custodial forces of an institution is
exacerbated within prisons by the negative influence of the
anti-authoritarian and antitherapeutic &quot;prisoners'
code.&quot; Under this code, suspicion colors most interactions
between staff and inmates. The result may be a program that
receives neither staff support nor inmate cooperation. </p>

<p> <b>Time in community drug treatment is inversely related to
posttreatment cocaine-heroin abuse and criminality.</b> </p>

<p> Turning to a more quantitative dimension of treatment
programming, the available research clearly suggests the longer
heroin and cocaine abusers remain in treatment, the greater the
reduction in post-treatment criminality. Those who remain in
community-based residential, methadone, or outpatient programs
for more than three months have lower levels of both
post-treatment heroin and cocaine abuse and criminality than
those who drop out before three months and significantly lower
rates than their own pre-treatment levels. Subsequent months of
treatment in these programs yield even greater reductions in
post-treatment criminality, especially after 12 months of
treatment and after each subsequent treatment cycle. </p>

<p> Treatment personnel generally agree that it is hard even to
stabilize the cocaine-heroin abuser's lifestyle in three months,
much less begin to transform long-standing patterns of deviance.
After three months, clients can begin to be comfortable with the
treatment regime and start to make progress in changing
disruptive patterns in their lives. However, due to the chronic
relapsing pattern characteristic of the drug addict, several
&quot;cycles of treatment&quot; are frequently necessary for
hardcore drug abusers to achieve substantial improvement in their
behavior and lifestyle. </p>

<p> Clients who leave treatment early against program advice are
significantly more likely to recidivate than those who complete
the recommended program, Early leavers who later return to
treatment ultimately have less heroin use and criminality than
those who fail to return.&quot; </p>

<p> Outcome studies have shown that the first 12 months in
treatment are critical to long-term reductions in criminality
after leaving treatment. For cocaine and heroin abusers who are
incarcerated <b>and </b>who participate in prison-based
therapeutic community programs, the optimum period of treatment
appears to be nine to twelve months followed by release into the
community. Longer stays are associated with diminishing results.
It is believed this occurs for two reasons: First, longer periods
of program participation while in prison creates increased
dependency on the program and less transference of the learned
experiences to the community upon release. Secondly, some persons
are transferred as rehabilitated back into the general prison
population after completing more than a year of treatment, and
the criminal subculture undermines some gains made during the
treatment period. Thus, the timing of treatment and release for
prison inmateswith serious drug abuse problems needs to be
coordinated to achieve the optimum outcome </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> Clearly, much has been learned about effective ways of
reducing the drug involvement of heroin and cocaine abusing
offenders. Given the chronic recurring nature of addiction, no
program can realistically expect to eliminate severe heroin and
cocaine abuse for all offenders. Yet even if a program succeeds
only in reducing the frequency of use, substantial reductions in
criminality may follow. The evidence is clear: cocaine-heroin
abusers commit much less crime when they use once or twice a week
or less often than when they use once a day or more often. If,
for example, daily cocaine-heroin users were placed under
court-directed intensive surveillance and frequent urine
monitoring which curtailed their use of drugs by half or more, a
very substantial drop in their criminality'. would be likely to
occur, especially in crimes such as robbery and burglary- </p>

<h3><a name="PolicyRecommendations">Policy recommendations </a> </h3>

<p> What steps should be taken by the criminal justice system to
deal more effectively with the drug-involved offender? Based on
the research findings discussed in the preceding section and the
experience and opinions of <b>the </b>authors, this section
presents a series of policy recommendations. While it may not be
possible to institute all or even most of these recommendations
in many jurisdictions, they are offered as goals or guidelines
for the practitioner. We argue that the interventions proposed
will improve the system by leading to the effective integration
and coordination of offender supervision and drug treatment
approaches. </p>

<p> Beginning with the crucial need to identify heroin and
cocaine abusers at arrest, the recommendations focus in turn on
jail-based interventions, inprison programs, and community
treatment options. Also included are systemwide recommendations
pertaining to the organization and staffing of drug abuse
treatment programs. All of the recommendations presented in this
;ection call for the criminal justice system to supervise
cocaine-heroin users frequently and systematically: </p>

<p> · Convicted cocaine-heroin abusers under community
supervision should be intensively supervised and compelled to
attend treatment for their maximum period of custody. Optimal
supervision includes near daily validation of employment, time in
residence, associations, and absence of drug use. </p>

<p> · Convicted cocainc-hcroin abusers sentenced to prison
should be required to participate in drug treatment for nine
months to one year prior to release <i>and </i>to continue in
community treatment as a condition of parole. Their urine and
behavior should be carefully monitored while under field
supervision to insure attendance and prevent relapses.&quot; </p>

<p> · Steps should be taken to ensure that drug-involved
offenders in city and county detention facilities are placed in
treatment after release, During their confinement, methadone
maintenance should be continued for addicts previously assigned
to this program or initiated for other heroin users. Naltrexone
combined with urine surveillance should be used for those heroin
users on work release who opt for drug-frcc treatment. </p>

<h4><a name="identification">The identification of drug-involved
offenders </a></h4>

<p> <b>In areas with a large number of heroin and cocaine users,
urinalysis should be used to identify these users at arrest.</b> </p>

<p> Most cocaine-heroin abusers who have contact with the
criminal justice system are arrested about once per year. Results
of the pretrial drug-testing program operating in Washington,
D.C. suggest that recent users of cocaine or heroin can be
identified accurately at arrest through urinalysis. By collccting
urine samples from all arrestees, and analyzing the specimens for
five types of drugs including opiates, the D.C. Pretrial Services
Agency has been able to identify and increase supervision of drug
users released pen-ding trial. These procedures appear to have
reduced the rates of rearrest and failure-to-appear. Moreover, by
systematically retaining the results of the urine tests, the
information has been made available to help determine appropriate
criminal sanctions for those arrestces ultimately
convicted.&quot; </p>

<p> The costs of a urine testing program may be amply justified
in any jurisdiction with a significant drug problem. As in D.C.,
the data collected should be systematically maintained and used
for determining conditions of pre-trial release and sanctions for
those convicted. In particular, the opportunity should be seized
to present appropriate treatment options. </p>

<h4><a name="jailbased">Jail-based interventions </a></h4>

<p> <b>Treatment orientation and referral to drug treatment
programs should </b>be <b>instituted </b>in <b>metropolitan
courts and jails.</b> </p>

<p> A central intake staff and/or representatives of drug
treatment programs should be present at court and in jails. All
offenders who test drug positive at arrest should be required to
attend orientation and preliminary intake procedures while in
detention. These preliminary treatment steps may help ensure that
those who are released from custody are placed in appropriate
treatment after returning to the community.&quot; </p>

<p> Full treatment interventions, however, should not be
initiated for cocaineheroin offenders who will be free of custody
in less than three months. It is neither cost effective nor
therapeutically wise to implement full treatment programming when
there is little expectation that treatment can be completed. </p>

<p> <b>Methadone programs should be permitted to maintain clients
in jails to facilitate resumption of treatment at the end of
detention.</b> </p>

<p> Methadone treatment has proven effective in reducing daily
heroin use and substantially reducing criminality among heroin
abusers. Enrolled methadone clients who are arrested can be
maintained on methadone while detained. In this way, return to
methadone treatment upon release after short-term jail custody
would be facilitated. Those who are convicted and sentenced to
incarceration should be given the option (when medically
recommended) to remain on methadone or to detoxify from methadone
and enter an in-prison therapeutic community. Consideration
should also be given to initiating methadone treatment in jails
for chronic heroin addicts. Heroin addicts serving short
sentences who arc introduced to methadone treatment while
incarcerated are more likely to enter and remain in methadone
maintenance treatment in the community when they are released
from custody. </p>

<p> <b>Daily naltrexone consumption should be used for some
convicted heroin abusers in combination with drug-free treatment
and intensive supervision.</b> </p>

<p> <i>For her-oin-abusing </i>offenders who receive jail or
probation sentences <i>and </i>who opt for drug-free treatment,
use of naltrexone (Trexan@), combined with urine surveillance,
could be instituted. Its use with jail inmates on work release or
school furlough appears particularly appropriate. Naltrexone is
an easily administered narcotic antagonist drug which taken daily
produces almost immediate withdrawal symptoms in addicts when
they use an opiatc, but is harmless to nonaddicts. It is most
effective with heroinaddicted offenders who have a high level of
community integration. It has no effect on cocaine, however;
therefore, urine monitoring <i>must be </i>sustained.'o </p>

<h4><a name="inprison">In-prison treatment </a></h4>

<p> <b>Therapeutic communities and other intensive milieu drug
treatments should be made available to cocaine-heroin abusing
state prisoners about one year prior to parole eligibility.</b> </p>

<p> A successful therapeutic community, the &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A), was developed at two
correctional facilities in New York Stateone for men and one for
women. This model therapeutic community in prison holds the
greatest promise for changing hard-core, drug-abusing inmates and
reducing recidivism.&quot; </p>

<p> Despite their proven effectiveness, few therapeutic
communities such as &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; are in place for
criminally involved drug abusers. One of the factors that limits
the creation of additional programs of this type is the concern
that such programs might engage in activities that threaten
security and encourage inmate resistance to the correctional
system. Nonetheless, correctional administrators learn quickly as
they become exposed to the operation of well-run programs that
such undesirable variance can be avoided. In fact, in
institutions where most of these programs have been established,
the wardens and correctional officers frequently are their most
vocal champions. To encourage their development, however, staff
and administration need education and training. Further, a number
of fiscal and practical issues have to be addressed prior to
implementation- </p>

<p> <b>The implementation of prison-based treatment programs
requires isolation from the general prison population.</b> </p>

<p> The inimical influence of the criminal inmate subculture
(&quot;prisoners' code&quot;) will inevitably undermine any
attempts to establish viable programming if the program is not
isolated from this anti-therapeutic force. Separate living
quarters, recreation, food services, etc. should be maintained
within the institution for this separation to be ideally
effective. Total isolation is, however, neither necessary nor
desirable; rather, some contact with the general inmate
population is useful for the purpose of allowing the inmate in
treatment to see where he has come from and how much he has
changed. In addition, the contact experience provides the
opportunity for the program resident to test both his new
prosocial values against the inmate subculture and his resistance
to negative influences. This kind of isolation is most possible
in medium security institutions with dormitorytype housing space
where one dormitory or two are physically segregated or separable
from the main institution. </p>

<p> <b>Prisoners in therapeutic communities who make good
treatment progress should be paroled to residential drug-free
programs that sustain the therapeutic community model prior to
completion of (heir sentence. They should be required to stay in
treatment as a condition of parole until their date of maximum
custody or until the program deems them recovered.</b> </p>

<p> It is essential for the successful treatment of
cocaine-heroin abuser offenders to maintain continuity-of-care
from the outset of treatment to termination of custody. While
there is benefit from prison treatment alone, these effects are
augmented and sustained by continuing that specific treat inent
in the community. </p>

<p> Ideally, release to the community facility would be
contingent on the progress made during in-prison treatment. Under
this incentive system, specific behaviors would be rewarded with
a specified number of restitution or release &quot;points&quot;
that might be administered as a form of &quot;good timc&quot;
system. Alternatively, prisoners might earn more favorable
conditions of confinement or higher status and associated program
privilege.-,. However it is administered, the basic notion is to
reinforce <b>the </b>desirability of pro-social behaviors. </p>

<h4><a name="community">Community treatment programs </a></h4>

<p> <b>Drug-abusing misdemennants should be considered for
communitybased sentencing alternatives.</b> </p>

<p> In lieu of confining drug-involved offenders in jails and
county penitentiaries, a range of intermediate sanctions should
be considered for heroin and cocaine abusers convicted of
misdemeanors. These might include house arrest with electronic
monitoring, intermittent sentences (e.g., weekend or evening
incarceration), TASC programs, or residence in a facility such as
a &quot;halfway in-halfway out&quot; center (a &quot;HiHo&quot;).
Again, in any of these alternatives offenders would ideally be
able to achieve release status more quickly by providing
drug-negative urine samples, routinely attending and
participating positively in treatment sessi ns, paying back their
victims, and providing evidence of prosocial activity.'2 </p>

<p> The community treatment resources available to support
intermediate sanctioning policies range from self-help groups
that meet once a week for a couple of hours to residential
facilities that provide 24 hour supervision and programming- At a
minimum, almost all communities have an Alcoholics Anonymous or
Narcotics Anonymous group that provides an context for recovering
substance abusers to meet, discuss day-to-day steps for
maintaining a drug free life, and participate in many different
types of social activities not involving alcohol or drugs.&quot;
Some communities provide drug treatment counseling through the
Department of Mental Health. And in many cities, recovering
substance-abusers operate group homes that use many of the same
principles of Alcoholics Anonymous or therapeutic communities
found in prison programs. </p>

<p> TASC programs run throughout the nation provide staff who are
familiar with the particular resources available for
drug-involved offenders in specific communities. And almost all
states have an agency that periodically determines the
availability of both private and public programs available for
drug treatment. <b>A </b>list of these agencies is available from
the National Association of State Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Directors, in Washington, DC </p>

<p> <b>Even if no other treatment is provided, heroin-cocaine
abusers who are on probation and parole should be required to
have frequent urine tests.</b> </p>

<p> Drug-abusing offenders on probation or parole who are in no
special treatment programs, as a minimum should be routinely
required to provide specimens for urinalysis over the entire
length of their probation or parole. At the outset the frequency
of urinalysis should be near daily, and decreascd as positive
progress warrants. The effective monitoring of urinalysis results
will help to interrupt relapse to daily heroin or cocaine use,
and, hence, high-rate criminality is likely to drop
substantially.&quot; When drug positive urines are detected,
offenders should be immediately confronted, clearly warned after
the first such incident, be required to enter treatment for
diagnosis and assessment after the second positive urine, and be
required to remain in treatment if relapse seems imminent or has
occurred. Refusal to enter treatment upon an affirmative
diagnosis should be considered a violation of release conditions.
</p>

<h4><a name="organization">Organization and staffing issues </a> </h4>

<p> <b>The integrity of the treatment programs for convicted
offenders must be maintained by developing structural safeguards
of independence and autonomy from correctional management.</b> </p>

<p> All too often well designed interventions operated by
competent and motivated agency and institutional staffs do not
succeed. Usually, the efforts arc not trusted by the criminal
justice clients, are overwhelmed by the difficulty of the
clients' problems, are weakened by inadequate funding and
institutional resistance, and are subject to high rates of staff
burnout and turnover. For a treatment program to last long enough
to make a substantial difference, it must maintain its own
integrity, ie., honesty and commitment to the treatment goals and
program participants. The staff must also have sufficient
independence and automony to deliver on their promises. </p>

<p> Treatment programs conducted by organizations independent of
(but closely linked to) corrections agencies are more likely to
maintain their integrity thz programs operated by correctional
staff within institutions or community corrections settings. This
suggests that an outside agency working in cooperation with or
under contract to the Department of Corrections may be the most
appropriate treatment organization. Management responsibility for
the rehabilitation program should be assigned to a team of
committed treatment professionals, as well as
ex-addict/ex-offender peer counselors, For this approach to work,
the power and authority of the treatment team should be
comparable to and complement the criminal justice authority. This
management group should be associated with and monitored by
respected professional self-help/therapeutic community
organizations, for example, Therapeutic Communities of America. </p>

<p> <b>Probation and parole officers should have their functions
divided into Surveillance Officers and Community 'fteatment Team
Leaders.</b> </p>

<p> For many years, correctional observers have debated the
wisdom of vesting probation and parole officers with the
potentially conflicting responsibilities of surveillance and
treatment. In the opinion of the authors, surveillance and
treatment functions of field supervision officers should be
separated to resolve the inherent conflicts and strengthen each
function. Essential to the effectiveness of the
treatment/counseling relationship is trust and confidentiality.
Persons tinder field supervision are unlikely to freely admit
criminal acts or drug use to someone in a position to return them
to prison for such violations. Therefore, surveillance and
rehabilitation responsibilities should be handled by staffs who
work separately but cooperatively to avoid role confusion for
both officer and offender. As the next recommendation suggests,
both types of officers should be augmented by carefully selected
exoffeiider-addicts who would serve as Monitors for the
Surveillance Officers and as Treatment Team staff for the
Community Treatment Team Leader. </p>

<p> The Treatment Team staff should rotate between working in
prison and the community to maintain continuity between the
rehabilitation efforts in both environments. For in-prison
programs, the objective of separating custodial and treatment
functions is satisfied by the organization discussed in the
preceding point. </p>

<p> <b>Former addict-offenders who have shown clear evidence of
prosocial change should have training and employment
opportunities, for example, as Monitors and Rntment Team members.</b>
</p>

<p> Large numbers of offenders who have been chronic
cocaine-heroin abusers are unable to gain and to keels legal
employment. Their background is so limited and so stigmatized
that legal employers are reluctant to employ them, and suspicious
after they do. Thus, even after making good treatment progress,
many offenders may still be unable to gain stable employment.
First, systematic skill development and training programs should
he providcd. Second, providing employment to ex-addict-offenders
within the treatment program itself is a valuable opportunity to
deal with this unemployment issue as well as cope with shortages
of field supervision personnel. </p>

<p> The employment of ex-addict-offenders in a variety of
progressively more responsible paraprofessional and professional
rolcs will help new monitoring and drug treatment systems
function effectively. They also will serve as role models to
offenders they supervise. The ex-addict offenders are the role
models (as in &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;) whose presence
demonstrates the realistic possibility of achieving successful
rehabilitation. Graduation from a drug treatment program,
evidence of successful integration into community life, and
additional training are prerequisites for the employment of
ex-addictoffenders as Monitors and Treatriient Team members. </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion2">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> By substantially reducing their cocaine-heroin abuse, the
criminality of drug-involved offenders may be reduced by 20 to 50
percent or more. To do so, however, the criminal justice system
must develop an alliance with the drug treatment system geared to
achieve the goals of effective rehabilitation, enhanced prosocial
behavior, and reduced recidivism. </p>

<p> The difficulties inherent in bringing about this alliance
should not be minimizcd. Some reallocation of resources clearly
will be required, with all the tensions attendant on any
significant shift in funding and operational priorities. If
custodial and treatment functions are to be effectively
separated, recruitment, training, and retraining programs will
have to be developed for community corrections personnel.
Institutional corrections environments must be prepared to accept
independent treatment organizations. Procedures must be developed
to identify and train those therapeutic community graduates best
qualified to become competent treatment team members and
monitors. The problem of intensive community resistance to
accepting community treatment facilities (HiHo's) that house
felons and substance abusers must also be addressed. Within
prisons, space will have to be reallocated to create therapeutic
communities to house clients during treatment. If institutions
are converted for total therapeutic community utilization,
abandoned mental hospitals may be utilized, with significant
capital expenditures necessary for conversion. Beginning at the
point of arrest, screening procedures will have to be developed
to monitor drug use and to identify cocaine-heroin users who can
most benefit from the proposed interventions. </p>

<p> Perhaps most important, cooperation will be needed among
stable drug abuse agencies and drug treatment programs and
criminal justice organizations (courts, probation, corrections,
and parole) that traditionally have had competing political and
fiscal interests and often lack a history of successful Joint
ventures. Careful documentation of pilot results will also be
needed to evaluate whether the system is moving in desired or
unanticipated directions. For this, evaluation researchers will
have to be in place from the outset. Since many problems will
arise that have the potential for compromising the interventions,
the evaluation design must provide decision makers with timcly
information to assist them in formulating corrective actions. At
the same time, ongoing dissemination of outcome information
through professional and media channels will help foster and
maintain the support necessary to accomplish the changes
proposed. </p>

<h3><a name="AppendixA">Appendix A </a></h3>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;: A model for prison-based drug
treatment </p>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N <b>Out&quot; </b>is a therapeutic community
(TC), in part based upon the Phoenix House model, that has been
operating in the New York State prison system for the last ten
years. Over time the program has been modified to operate more
effectively within the prison environment. The program has been
fortunate to be operated by many of the founding staff who have
provided the vision, commitment, and determination necessary for
a successful prison program. </p>

<p> An early evaluation of the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; program
indicated that it was successfully implemented, maintained a
positive TC environment, and produced positive psychological and
behavioral changes in participants. In 1984, the National
Institute <b>on </b>Drug Abuse funded an evaluation of &quot;Stay
'N Out&quot;, comparing it to two other prison-bascd programs in
New York State and a control group of inmates on program waiting
lists, but receiving no treatment. A milieu program and a
standard counseling program were the comparison groups. Although
participants were not randomly assigned to thcsc treatment
conditions, preliminary results of the comparison are
provocative. The data indicate the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program for nine to twelve
months were less likely to have problems while on parole than
either those who left &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; earlier or those in
other prison-based programs. For example, &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program more than nine months
were more likely to have a positive parole discharge (80 percent
positive) than those who remained in the program less than three
months (50 percent positive). Positiv e parole discharge is
defined as no reported violations of parole during the parole
custody period. Long-term (9-12 months) participants of the other
programs studied also had fewer cases of positive parole
discharge; the milieu program reported a 56 percent positive
discharge rate and the counseling program a 47 percent positive
rate. </p>

<p> Preliminary analysis indicates that long-term &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; participants may also have a more encouraging pattern
of re-arrest than those in the other programs. Continuing
follow-up shows that only 27 percent of the TC participants were
re-arrested compared to 35 percent of the milieu participants, 50
percent of the counseling participants, and 42 percent of the
waiting list persons. In addition, TC participants averaged 18
months to rearrest compared to 11 months for the milieu and nine
months for the counseling group. These data should be interpreted
with caution, however, as variation in the actual number of days
at risk may vary greatly among samples. </p>

<h4><a name="overview">Program overview </a></h4>

<p> 64 Stay IN Out&quot; programs were begun as a joint effort
among New York </p>

<p> State Division of Substance Abuse Services (DSAS), New York
Therapeutic Communities (NYTC), New York Department of
Correctional Services (DOCS), and the New York State Division of
Parole. Currently, NYTC. operates the programs, DOCS supplies
funding, and Parole provides increased opportunities for program
residents. The DSAS Bureau of Research and Evaluation continues
to evaluate the program. </p>

<p> The current program consists of two treatment units for male
inmates in one facility with 35 beds per unit (a total capacity
of 70 beds), and one treatment unit with 40 beds for women
-inmates in another facility. Each unit is staffed by a total of
seven persons, including both professionals and
paraprofessionals. Inmates selected for the programs are
recruited at Statc correctional facilities. The criteria for
selection are: history of drug abuse, at least 18 years of age,
evidence of positive institutional participation, and no history
of sex crimes or mental illness. &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; clients
are housed in units segregated from the general prison
population. They cat in a common dining room, however, and attend
morning activities with other prisoners. The optimum length of
treatment is from nine to twelve months. Most program staff are
ex-addict-offenders who are graduates of community T)Cs: they act
as &quot;role models&quot; exemplifying successful
rehabilitation. The course of treatment is a developmental growth
process with the inmate becoming an increasingly responsible
member of the program. </p>

<p> During the early phase of treatment, the clinical thrust
involves assessment of client needs and problem areas.
Orientation to the prison TC procedures occurs through individual
counseling, encounter sessions, and seminars. Clients are given
low-level jobs and granted little status. During the later phases
of treatment, residents are provided opportunities to earn
higherlevel positions and increased status through sincere
involvement in the program and hard work. Encounter groups and
counseling sessions are more in-depth and focus on the areas of
self-discipline, self-worth, selfawareness, respect for
authority, and acceptance of guidance for problem areas. Seminars
take on a more intellectual nature. Debate is encouraged to
enhance self-expression and to increase self-confidence. </p>

<p> Ilpon release, participants are encouraged to seek further
substance abuse treatment at cooperating community TCs. Extensive
involvement with a network of community TCs is central to the
program's operation. Staff and senior residents of community TCs
visit &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; on a regular basis to recruit
resident inmates for their programs. These visitors provide
inspiration since they are ex-addicts and ex-felon role models
who are leading economically and socially productive lives. </p>
