             <STRONG><H1>  How to Control Gophers/Moles Organically</H1></STRONG>
     Pocket  Gophers, or Ground Squirrels as they are sometimes called,
can  be as big a problem as ants.  1.  Gophers are like little bulldozers.
They  dig  a  network of tunnels  usually six to 12  inches  below  the
surface. 2.  Tunnels near the surface are for gathering food and  act  as
highways to get around; deeper ones are for sleeping, raising the young
and storing food. Well-suited to burrowing, gophers have small eyes and
ears  that  don't clog with dirt, and sensitive whiskers and  tails  to
guide  them in the dark. Gophers have long teeth for biting off  chunks
of  hard  soil or roots. They are sensitive to sound, and a variety  of
smells,  as well as light.  3. To successfully control gophers  and  other
rodents, one needs to understand their senses of smell and hearing.  If
you  see  a plant being dragged under ground you know you have gophers.
Gophers  eat  plant  roots  as well as bulbs.   They  will  eat  almost
anything  including most vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots,  squash,
lettuces,  etc. and they also love roses (the roots). They'll nibble  on
the roots of your fruit trees, roots of most flowers, and tulips. Moles
are  insectivores  they eat earthworms, bugs, larvae,  grubs,  spiders,
centipedes  and only occasionally nibble on greens and roots.  Most  of
the  time,  they  do  very  little  damage  other  than  through  their
tunneling,   unearthing plants and exposing root systems. How  can  you
tell a gopher from a mole? Gopher mounds have dirt pushed off to one side
of  the mound while moles have a volcano effect with the center at  the
entrance  to  the tunnel (usually plugged up). Poisons do not  work  on
moles! They must be trapped and moved away.

     Gophers  can do a great deal of damage, 4. but are an important  part
of  the natural ecosystem. I do not recommend the use of traps as  they
are  inhumane  and very cruel. 5. It is important that you properly  feed
and  care for your plants as gophers are less likely to attack  healthy
plants.  By  top-dressing your lawn and property  with  year-old  horse
manure,  you  will  not only be feeding your soil, but  also  repelling
gophers  naturally  as  they  do not like  manure.  You  will  also  be
encouraging  natural predators as compost promotes healthy
environments which  always attracts the variety of life needed for there
to  be a balance.

   <STRONG><H1> When there is balance there is co-existence.</H1></STRONG>


_______________________________
     1 And as easy to control!
     2 The deeper the tunnel, the older the gopher that dug it!
     3 This is the key to their control!
     4  If  they wanted to do damage they would! It would be better  to
get  used  to  them if possible then to try and kill them  off.  A  lot
depends  on where you live. In my garden, gophers come and go  as  they
please. They are welcome as they do a lot of soil turning over for  me!
It is not hard to train them to only be in certain areas of your garden
and to leave other areas alone. Actually, I like gophers coming through
certain  parts of my garden during the right times for them  to  loosen
the  soil for me, eat any grubs, insects and then leave the garden  for
me and my vegetables!
     5  Unless you use the humane traps which don't hurt them and  they
can then be moved to another safer area.
