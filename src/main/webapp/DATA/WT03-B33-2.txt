ALPHASERVER 8400 ARRAY PERFORMANCE
SIMILAR TO MAINFRAME'S POWER

Digital Equipment Corporation has announced new technology,
PCI Memory Channel interconnect, that enables its highly
scalable AlphaServer systems to deliver new levels of
affordability and price/performance for the technical
computing market. Digital has showcased these new capabilities
in an array of eight AlphaServer 8400 systems with a total of
96 Alpha 64-bit processors running 64-bit Digital UNIX.

"Digital's new scalable AlphaServer 8400 array offers a
preview of the next generation in enterprise supercomputing,"
said Gary Smaby, president, Smaby Group, Inc. "By linking
dozens of its blazingly fast Alpha microprocessors through a
robust memory interconnect architecture, Digital has
constructed a mainframe-class computing platform for high-end
technical users tackling applications that benefit from
parallel processing. The system leverages the cost benefits of
commodity componentry to deliver a compelling
price/performance alternative to traditional supercomputers
and MPPs."

Digital makes high performance affordable for compute-
intensive, technical applications such as computational fluid
dynamics, computational chemistry, weather modeling, and
molecular and genetics research. Digital delivers outstanding
price/ performance by taking advantage of standard,
high-volume, low-cost components including a high-speed
interconnect and optimized software. As each processor
delivers 600 MFLOPS, a 96 processor system delivers 57.6
GFLOPS of computing power -- for only $4.5 million.

This combination of affordable price and high performance
enables a wide variety of users to attain performance levels
previously available only with expensive, specialized
supercomputers. Users who would never have been able to afford
supercomputer-class power can now do so with Digital's
systems.

"Digital is making high-performance computing affordable for
more applications than ever before," said Dr. Michael Levine,
scientific director, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. "We're
finding that Digital's approach to connecting AlphaServers is
elegantly simple, and both very powerful and very cost
effective. We can connect AlphaServers of different sizes,
which is important to us because it enables us to match our
systems and applications most efficiently. We're currently
using the system for molecular dynamics, visualization, finite
element and simulated annealing code, and think this
technology prepares us for the future of high-performance
computing."

Standards-based Commodity Components for Outstanding
Performance and Affordability

Digital delivers these new levels of price/performance by
leveraging commodity hardware and software components. A
standards- based PCI bus Memory Channel interconnect is used
to link multiple AlphaServer systems. This low-latency (less
than 5 microseconds), high-bandwidth (100 Mbytes/sec)
interconnect provides high-speed, memory-to-memory
communications among up to eight AlphaServer 8400 systems,
which allows the multiple systems to operate essentially as a
single system with 57.6 GFLOPS of power. The Memory Channel
interconnect can also link lower-cost AlphaServer 2000
systems for extremely cost-effective high-performance
solutions.

Digital also provides a suite of software tools that allows
technical users to optimize their applications for the new
technology. The software includes:

o Digital UNIX, the industry's only 64-bit UNIX operating
system, which provides greater standards-compliance and higher
performance than any other available UNIX operating system.

o High Performance Fortran (HPF), which allows the arrayed
systems to be programmed as easily as a single system. HPF
automatically optimizes communications among processors for
maximum performance and allows the system to be easily scaled
for a variable number of processors.

o Parallel Software Environment (PSE), which provides the
runtimes for HPF, and performance analysis and debugging tools
for developing parallel applications.

o Digital PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), an enhanced version
of public domain PVM, which facilitates the creation of
parallel applications.

o MPI (Message Passing Interface), software developed with
Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, which enables users to
create parallel applications for these systems using an
optimized version of the industry-standard software for
message passing.

Digital's use of these standards-based, off-the-shelf hardware
and software components allow it to deliver systems that are
lower cost, easier to expand and simpler to program than
competitive systems.

"Digital is the leading provider of high-performance UNIX
solutions, as demonstrated by the industry's first
implementation of 64-bit UNIX in 1993, our Very Large Memory
systems last spring, and now the new level of price and
performance of arrayed systems," said Pauline Nist, vice
president, AlphaServer Business Segment, Digital Equipment
Corp. "Through our Technical Solutions Initiative, we have the
high-level expertise to deliver solutions that meet the unique
needs of users in the technical segment. The technology in
these AlphaServer arrays leverages the fastest processors,
the best interconnect, proven, shipping, software and low-cost
commodity components to deliver the best available
high-performance solutions for technical computing."

Digital's Very Large Memory (VLM) technology dramatically
improves application performance by increasing the amount of
information that can be stored in memory. Digital is the only
company delivering high-performance 64-bit servers,
AlphaServer systems, and a 64-bit operating system, Digital
UNIX, which together make VLM64 possible. Whereas 32-bit
systems are limited to 2 Gbytes of memory, AlphaServer 8400
systems can store up to 14 Gbytes of data in memory, for fast
access to large amount of data.

Digital's Technical Solutions Initiative provides customers in
engineering and scientific environments with complete
application solutions.

Through the Technical Solutions Initiative, Digital provides
AlphaStation and AlphaServer customers in mechanical design
and analysis, electronic design and analysis, geographic
information systems, technical CASE and science and research
with industry- leading application performance and
price-performance advantages.

Pricing and Availability

The hardware and software components in the AlphaServer array
will be available in January, 1996. The AlphaServer 8400
array with 96 processors; 4 gigabytes of memory; 32 gigabytes
of disk space; PCI Memory Channel interconnect; Digital UNIX,
HPF, PSE and Digital PVM is priced at $4.5 million. Other

UNIX SERVERS REPLACE MAINFRAMES
IN NEW GLOBAL RESERVATION SYSTEM

Best Western International, Inc., the world's largest hotel
brand, has selected multiple AlphaServer 8400 "TurboLaser"
systems, the world's most powerful servers, together with
thousands of Digital personal computers, to power Best
Western's new worldwide central reservation system (CRS).

When fully implemented, the deal will be worth more than $12
million in Digital revenue. A total of 10 AlphaServer 8400
systems will power Best Western's operations center central
host server, located in Phoenix, Ariz., as well as BWI's
reservation centers located in Phoenix, Wichita, Kan., Dublin,
Ireland, and Milan, Italy. The new servers will run Oracle7
relational database management system with the 64-bit Digital
UNIX operating system, handling in excess of 2,000
transactions per second. AlphaServer systems will replace
outdated and over-extended mainframes.

In addition, Digital will deliver some 3,500 Digital Venturis
535 PCs to every Best Western property worldwide, where they
will provide a full range of inventory and rate management
capabilities. This part of the system will enable hoteliers to
enroll in Best Western marketing programs and create their own
programs and pricing packages.

"Today we unveil the hotel industry's most ambitious, advanced
customer reservation system. We selected the
Digital/Oracle/UNIX solutions because of its superior
performance, flexibility, and growth potential -- at one-tenth
the cost of competing systems," said William S. Watson, Best
Western International's executive vice president.

"We expect the Digital/Oracle solution to dramatically improve
our ability to respond more rapidly to customer needs, to
quickly provide our client agents more and more relevant
information on our customers' travel preferences, to increase
our sales and revenues, and to enhance our company's image,"
Watson added.

The new system is expected to to generate more than $50
million in incremental annual room revenue and will
significantly reduce corporate and property level operating
costs.

Pace-setting Global Reservation System

Best Western's new central reservations systems, scheduled for
a March 15, 1996, start-up, offers unprecedented features and
functions, both at the property level and at the Best Western
central reservations offices. It will be a service
enhancement for the 40 million travelers worldwide who stay at
Best Western hotels each year.


With the new CRS, Best Western will be the only hotel chain to
provide comprehensive geographic, pictorial, and textual
information to its reservation sales agents. These features
will enable guests who call a Best Western central reservation
office from any location, whether at home or on the road, to
find the Best Western hotel that is closest to their desired
destination.

The new system will enable Best Western to provide detailed
guest histories, group booking capabilities, revenue
management service, travel agent commission data, and a wide
range of property-specific and destination information.

Yet the new system is much more than a traditional
transaction- oriented network. It will provide the business
tools to more clearly target and service BWI's existing and
future customers.

"Best Western recognizes that emerging technologies will bring
radical changes to the way products are distributed to its
customers. This vision led Best Western to select Digital and
Oracle as technology partners for the new millennium," said
Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of the AlphaServer
Business Segment. "While Best Western customers may never know
what's 'under the hood' of the new reservation system, Best
Western managers will sleep better knowing our systems are
providing those customers the fastest, most reliable services
in the travel industry."

Digital's AlphaServer 8400 Systems

AlphaServer 8400 systems are based on the world's fastest
microprocessor, the 300 MHz Alpha 21164. They support up to 12
service, travel agent commission data, and a wide range of
property-specific and destination information.

Yet the new system is much more than a traditional
transaction- oriented network. It will provide the business
tools to more clearly target and service BWI's existing and
future customers.

"Best Western recognizes that emerging technologies will bring
radical changes to the way products are distributed to its
customers. This vision led Best Western to select Digital and
Oracle as technology partners for the new millennium," said
Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of the AlphaServer
Business Segment. "While Best Western customers may never know
what's 'under the hood' of the new reservation system, Best
Western managers will sleep better knowing our systems are
providing those customers the fastest, most reliable services
in the travel industry."

Digital's AlphaServer 8400 Systems

AlphaServer 8400 systems are based on the world's fastest
microprocessor, the 300 MHz Alpha 21164. They support up to 12
64-bit processors and 14 Gbytes of memory, and can be
clustered for far greater performance.

Recently, Digital and Oracle together shattered the
transaction processing world performance record in benchmark
testing (tpcC) defined and audited by the independent
Transaction Processing Performance Council. This was
accomplished on an AlphaServer 8400, Digital UNIX operating
system, and Oracle 7 database system. The Digital/Oracle
solution bested the previous record held by Hewlett Packard by
75 percent, and was far better than the best systems from IBM,
Sun, AT&T, and Tandem.

Taken together, the 64-bit Alpha technology, 64-bit Digital
UNIX, and 64-bit databases such as Oracle7 enable the
breakthrough performance and price/performance of VLM64.
Digital is unique in the industry in its ability to deliver
this capability to customers today.

Applications such as data warehousing, financial management,
and online transaction processing take particular advantage
of VLM64 solutions. This is because more than 4 billion times
more data can be stored in memory than even the most powerful
mainframe systems, at a fraction of the cost. This provides
dramatic improvements in processing speed, application
performance, and system affordability.

Digital's Venturis PCs

Digital Venturis is Digital's value-oriented desktop PC family
designed to meet the computing requirements of general
business users in standard office applications, as well as
those of users in a client/server environment. Ideal for the
volume purchaser, Venturis systems are simple to install, easy
to use and easy to maintain, while providing room to expand as
computing needs evolve.

ALISA SYSTEMS SOLVES COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS
BETWEEN MAINFRAME AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS
FOR WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

The Bridge Design Office in the Washington State Department of
Transportation had a serious E-Mail problem. Three
incompatible electronic mail systems were being used in the
department which made inter-sectional communication difficult.

"We had installed a VAX-based system in our Bridge Design
Office, but NetWare and AppleTalk systems were being installed
in the rest of the department," recalled Dick Stoddard of the
Department of Transportation. "We used VMS Mail internally and
didn't worry about talking to other offices because phone and
conventional mail was the normal way of doing business,"
Stoddard said.

Stoddard, who works in the office that is responsible for
design calculations and "putting out bridge plans", was
becoming increasingly concerned about the E-Mail compatibility
problem because the department was changing the way it did
business. Department E-mail was becoming a critical tool for
administrators and designers. "We just had no integration tool
between VMS Mail and other department mail systems," said
Stoddard. The Bridge Design Office needed to integrate their
VMS mail system with the Microsoft Mail being used on
AppleTalk and NetWare networks without spending a huge sum of
money to install a unified mail system. Luckily for them, they
found Alisa Systems.

Alisa Systems was referred to the Department by several
different companies as an expert in electronic mail
integration. Alisa's AlisaMail software is designed to work
with all of the major mail systems in use today and can be
installed as a central post office.

Alisa sent in a systems engineer who set up the program and
the result was better communication between the Bridge Design
Office and the rest of the department.

"I think it does a very good translation and connection," said
Stoddard. "The connection into the Apple side was almost
transparent. If there's any VMS users out there that need to
communicate with NetWare and MicroSoft Mail, the connections
work very well." Stoddard added, adding, "It's great when an
entire department gets plugged into compatible mail systems."

Alisa Systems was able to provide the Department of
Transportation with a small, cost-effective solution that
allowed their systems to be compatible. The AlisaMail software
was not the only aspect of Alisa Systems that Stoddard was
pleased with. "Their technical staff and their support was
very prompt," he said.

VAX AND RISC-6000 NOW COMMUNICATE WITH PERSONAL
COMPUTER E-MAIL SYSTEMS AT CARPET MANUFACTURER

Manufacturing depends on the right machinery to get the job
done, but the "machinery" may not always be the kind that
actually makes the product. In addition to manufacturing
hardware, production relies heavily on communication for the
product to get out the door on time.

Shaw Industries, in Dalton Georgia, the world's largest carpet
manufacturer, was having a difficult time keeping up with its
production schedule because departments housed in separate
buildings couldn't communicate. The departments weren't
ignoring each other; their computers were speaking different
languages. Instead of instantaneous E-mail, Shaw was
inefficiently "snail mailing" messages between departments on
foot. The disadvantages were obvious.

"Our company is international, having branches in Great
Britain, Mexico and Australia and also working with outside
vendors and outside clients," said Martha Roberts, a Technical
Specialist for the company. "We have many internal
E-mail systems including ccMail and MicroSoft Mail.  We also
have a large 34-node DEC VAX system and an IBM RISC-6000
computer, each with more E-mail users," she continued.  All
these systems needed to be able to E-mail back and forth
between users corporate-wide. Manufacturing needed to send
production reports and other information to distribution and
we didn't have the local infrastructure in place to where you
could do that easily," Roberts recalled.

Rather than making a huge investment in a single compatible
computer system, Shaw contacted Alisa Systems of Pasadena,
Calif. Alisa brought its technical support engineer on-site
and integrated the company's computers in record time.

"We were up and running in three days," said Roberts, adding,
"I have 2200 AlisaMail users here and corporate-wide. I'd say,
overall, we've got 40,000 users. Reporting time has been
dramatically reduced because it's been automated through the
AlisaMail system," Roberts added. Shaw Industries has also
been extremely pleased with Alisa's technical support staff.
"They're always there when we need them and the training
classes were great," Roberts said enthusiastically.

Needless to say, with AlisaMail, departments at Shaw
Industries are talking to each other again and production is
back on schedule.
