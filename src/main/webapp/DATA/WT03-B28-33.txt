POWER GROWTH, ECLSS CHANGE CONSIDERED

        Space Station officials are considering increasing the power
capability of the four Space Station photovoltaic modules and an
early closure of the Environmental Control Life Support System
(ECLSS) oxygen loop, according to Reston Space Station chief Robert
Moorehead.
        In an interview with SPACE STATION NEWS late last week,
Moorehead said the agency is considering increasing the capability
of the four photovoltaic modules (two of which are located on each
end of the Station's truss) by an additional 3 kilowatts (KW) which
would provide a total addition of 12KW onboard the Station at
assembly complete.
        The Station is currently slated to have a total of 75KW power
at assembly complete.  Of that total, it is estimated that
housekeeping or Station operations will consume 45KW and users will
share 30KW.
        Prior to the recent Station changes, users were to receive
some 37-1/2KW.  Station officials officially readjusted that figure
last fall during the rephasing activity.
        The availability of power onboard the Station has been a major
concern among various Station users and Hill officials during
recent months.
        Adding to concerns over the new official lower user power
estimate have been unofficial reports out of the Reston Space
Station office that estimates of power available to users, when the
international modules were in place on the Station, had actually
dipped as low as 15KW (SSN, 12/18/89).
        Moorehead said the extra 12KW would help solve "the perceived
power difficulty" and could be dedicated almost entirely to Station
users.
        Although he did not indicate specifically whether the
additional 12KW would be added to the 30KW currently slated for
users or simply be used to help fulfill the 30KW user requirement,
a NASA official said later that, as currently conceived, it would
be added to the 30KW slated for users.
        Moorehead did say, that he personally believes that 45KW for
housekeeping is excessive and said Station officials would scrub
and scrub and scrub to reduce that figure.  The decision to
increase the power capability of the photovoltaic modules is
strictly an agency budgetary decision, Moorehead said, and poses no
significant technical risks.

Return To Original ECLSS Plans Also Contemplated

        In addition to increased power, Moorehead said Station
officials are also considering a shift back toward original ECLSS
plans.  The old baseline program included a closed oxygen loop
ECLSS early in the Station's assembly.
        In the current Station baseline, the ECLSS oxygen loop will
remain open initially and be closed by assembly complete.  Late
closure means that prior to assembly complete, oxygen will have to
be transported to the Station and at assembly complete it would be
regenerated on the Station.
        Station officials said last fall that the change would produce
significant front-end cost savings and some reduction of power
consumption at the Permanent Manned Capability milestone, but
conceded in congressional testimony that it would also increase
total assembly launch weight by 6,600 lbs. due to gas storage
requirements and increase resupply weight every 90 days by 2,470
lbs.
        Station officials also said the change would require
development of a new cryogenic oxygen carrier needed for resupply
prior to the period when regenerative capability was added.  Cost
of the carrier was estimated at about $16 million.  Now, Moorehead
said, "a proposal (is) being submitted by the Marshall Space Flight
Center that we move that forward and close the loop and never do
this block one (initial open, then closed loop) thing that says
transport oxygen to the Station."  Both changes, "are under
consideration, but they have not been made a part of the program
(or baselined)."

HOUSE PANEL CALLS FOR MORE STATION HEARINGS

        The House Space, Science and Technology Committee will waste
no time in taking up the Space Station again when Congress
reconvenes later this month.  It has currently rescheduled a
hearing with the Space Station international partners for Jan. 30,
at 1 p.m.  The hearing was originally planned to be conducted late
last fall when a similar hearing was held on recent Space Station
changes, but was cancelled due to scheduling problems, according to
Hill officials.  In addition, look for the panel to schedule a
hearing with Station officials early in its series of hearings on
NASA's 1991 authorization.  Committee staffers say they hope to
track where the program has gone since the October hearing and to
reexamine remaining issues.
        The panel's concern over some the recent Station changes has
apparently not fully subsided since its hearing on the issue last
November.  A top Committee staffer reiterated Committee Chairman
Robert A. Roe's (D-N.J.) disappointment over some of the recent
changes.  The issue, he said, has become one of "credibility" with
the Committee.  Of high concern to the Committee is the idea of
wasted tax dollars associated with continuous changes.  "We do have
a sense that you've got to start cutting metal at some point in
earnest and at that point you've got to know what the configuration
is that you're working toward.  Now, where that point comes...I
mean in no way do we want to take away from NASA's management
prerogatives to make judgments on the thing, but by the same token
I think there's just a fundamental question of spending the
taxpayers money efficiently.  You can't keep floundering around
spending a $1 billion a year on this thing and not knowing what
your doing."
        With regard to the international hearing, a Committee staffer
said the panel hopes to examine how recent changes and uncertainty
in timing of the multi-billion project will affect political
support for the program within the various participating countries.
        European Space Agency (ESA) officials confirm that they will
attend the hearing--with ESA director general Reimar Luest
scheduled to appear--but there was no firm word at our deadline as
to whether representatives from Canada and Japan would appear.
        Canadian Space Station official Mac Evans said he doubts that
the Canadians will accept the invitation, although no final
decision had been made yet.  Canada's Department of External
Affairs will make the decision.  Evans reiterated the Canadian
government's long-standing policy concerning government officials
testifying before foreign bodies and said a rare precedent would be
set if Canadian officials did testify.
        A Japanese official said no word had not come from Tokyo as of
last week as to whether Japanese officials would attend.  But he
said the decision could go either way.

ESA Likely to Press Larger Multi-Year Funding Issues

        An ESA official said the agency will probably use the upcoming
hearing on international Station concerns to address some of the
broader issues relating to the program such as long-term funding,
rather than as a forum to wrestle over individual concerns.
        All three of the Station international partners have expressed
remaining concerns over the revised Station plans, with both the
Japanese and Europeans wanting earlier module launch dates than the
February and June 1998 dates planned, respectively.  But although
NASA has been reviewing and negotiating with the partners over such
concerns, the likelihood of any major changes in this area remains
to be seen.
        With regard to ESA's request, Space Station officials have set
a condition for the Europeans before changing the module launch
date.
        Reston Space Station chief Robert Moorehead tells SPACE
STATION NEWS that although NASA's look at the situation indicates
there are some trade-offs in the Station assembly sequence which
could be made to accommodate an earlier ESA launch, Station
officials want a firm commitment as to when the module will be
ready for launch before going any further with the change.
        Although ESA has selected a prime contractor for the Columbus
program, it has not completed negotiations on the program.  Sources
say when Station officials toured European contractor facilities
last fall they were given a later date from ESA contractors as to
when the module would be ready than they had received from ESA
officials, prompting their present position.
        An ESA official indicated that the Europeans are confident the
ESA module would be ready.  Obviously, "It would be rather foolish
of us to propose a date if we didn't think we could make it."  With
regard to ESA's latest launch proposal, he said it "was a different
assembly sequence that got the APM (Attached Pressurized Module) up
earlier," and did not involve launching of the ESA man-tended free-
flyer prior to the APM launch as has been discussed.
        While the Japanese have expressed interest in an earlier
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) launch date, they seem to have
been less insistent upon it, as compared to ESA.  A Japanese
official summed up their position on the matter by saying "If that
(the February 1998 JEM launch date) is the minimum delay that NASA
can (offer), then I think that we will have to endure.  We were
very much upset by the fall rescheduling operation by NASA, but on
the other hand we have to be realistic about the prospects of the
future budget of the Space Station."

CURRENT STATION MILESTONES DETAILED

        Below the current milestones for the Space Station Freedom, as
provided by NASA, are detailed.  Also included are milestone dates
estimated in October and those associated with the previous
baseline.  Current milestones differ from October estimates
primarily with regard to Early Man-Tended Capability (EMTC) and
launch of the ESA APM, with a slip from the October estimate of
EMTC and a slightly earlier APM launch date than was estimated by
top Station officials in October.  The current milestones shown do
not reflect any of the on-going reviews or changes under
consideration, such as earlier launches of APM or JEM modules.

RESTON CHIEF SEES FIRM BASELINE AS KEY CHALLENGE

     Since being named last October to head the Reston Program
Office, Robert Moorehead has overseen the program's Level II
activities during one of the Station's most fluid and turbulent
times.  When Moorehead, a former Space Shuttle official from
Johnson Space Flight Center, took the position of Deputy Director,
Programs and Operations, he was the fourth person to head up the
organization in less than a year.  Since coming onboard, he has
overseen the difficult task of molding the Station's assembly
sequence to meet the current rephased or rescoped Space Station
program.  In an interview last week with SPACE STATION NEWS,
Moorehead said his greatest challenge in the coming year will be to
ensure a stable Station baseline is in place.  Excerpts of the
interview are printed below.

INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS

SSN: What is the current situation with regard to earlier launch
dates of the international modules?

Moorehead: "The internationals have had some concerns about when
they would be put on orbit and we have conducted some studies and
we have some ways to move them earlier in the assembly sequence.
You have to make trades when you do that.  So, if you move them
earlier in the assembly sequence then you have to give up
utilization flights earlier so you can't do as much, if you will,
with their modules, but yet they would be on-orbit.  We've
conducted that as an off-line study, but it's not a part of the
program.  It's just an off-line study.  There have been no firm
decisions."

SSN: What is the situation specifically with regard to ESA's
request?

Moorehead: "The way we view that is that there's some things that
we could do.  But we would not propose to make any changes until
they (ESA) have a more firm schedule in place.  As you know they
have selected a contractor, but they have not negotiated their
program.  They're in the process of doing that.  There's some
things that could be done, some shifting of priorities, but we
don't think we can go much further in that activity until we get a
firm commitment from them on when they can deliver their product.
Something can be done, you have to make some trades.  You have to
give up utilization flights or outfitting flights or things of that
nature.  But we don't propose to go any further until they are
willing to make a firm commitment on schedule."

USER CONCERNS

SSN: Looking at some of the user concerns, have there been any
changes with regard to the switch in the hab/lab modules as it
relates to the life science centrifuge facility?

Moorehead: "We have met all the user requirements.  That's an
interesting story.  At the outset, I said that what we are trying
to introduce into this program is some discipline and rigor.
There's a way to get requirements into this program...On the
centrifuge, the requirement is that we accommodate the 1.8 meter
diameter centrifuge and that we don't upset the microgravity
environment onboard.  We can accommodate that centrifuge in either
one of two places.  We can accommodate it in the lab or we can
accommodate it in a node.  The baseline's in the lab by now.  And
our analysis, and the Code E or the scientist people have concurred
with that analysis, is that yes indeed, we can meet the
microgravity requirement and have that centrifuge reside either in
the node or in the lab.  So we have met our requirements.  Now
there's some things that have been published, some things that have
been discussed in the media SPACE STATION NEWS, January 8, 1990

that are not requirements in the program.  If they want to have
additional requirements on the program, the process is come to the
program with a change request.  They talk about location of the
centrifuge relative to hab or lab and animal storage facilities.
They talk about growth of the centrifuge to a larger diameter, but
those things are not requirements.  They have not been written down
and have not been written into the program.  The point I want to
make is that we have met all the requirements that have been stated
through official channels.  We're here to serve the user and if
they have other requirements and they're willing to state them,
then we'll work those requirements."  (It should be noted that life
science officials have said they were aware that some of their
concerns had not actually been written formally into the program,
but nonetheless were assumed to be available or provided.)

SSN: So that switch in the placement of the hab and lab modules is
a permanent thing?

Moorehead: "As far as we're concerned...unless there's another
requirement that's accepted by the program that would cause us to
change that.  Yes, that is a permanent thing.  The other thing that
they complained about is that in the rebaselined program they
alleged that we deleted some of the lab support equipment.  Number
one, we've added the lab support equipment back."

SSN: Into whose budget?

Moorehead: "It's in Station's budget.  There was some general
purpose lab support equipment that was slated to be handled by the
Station so we've added it back.  Now, the users are saying 'we
aren't ready to define it.  It'll be '91 until we can tell you what
we really want.'  So you might say we played poker and we called
their bluff and they're not ready to define what equipment they
want.  I'm saying that the Station proposes to provide $30 million,
or whatever the dollar number was, of lab support equipment that at
one time we had deleted, we propose now to add that back."

SYSTEM CHANGES

SSN: Have there been any major systems changes since the
information on the new Station program was presented at the
congressional hearing last fall?

Moorehead: "We decided before we formally baselined the assembly
sequence to do away with the passive radiators (on the thermal
control system).  That was the last change in systems that we've
made.  We have some ongoing studies.  We always have on-going
studies.  There are two other changes that we are con-
sidering...(One) of those being what I call growth of the power of
the solar arrays such that we get additional power."

SSN: At what stage in the process?

Moorehead: "From the very beginning.  Increasing the capability of
each power module by about 3 kilowatts.  So that would help the
perceived power difficultly that we have.  At assembly complete
we'd have 12 additional kilowatts of power, if we choose to do
that.  The other major change that's under the consideration is
closing that oxygen loop on the ECLSS.  That again was a block type
thing."  Under current Station plans, "for a while we transport
oxygen to the Space Station and then just before assembly complete
we would close the loop, if you will, and regenerate the oxygen
onboard the Station.  Where now there is a proposal being
(submitted) by the Marshall Space Flight Center that we move that
forward and close the loop and never do this block one thing that
says transport oxygen to the Station.  Those are under
consideration, but they have not been made a part of the program."

SSN: With regard to power, there has been considerable concern over
power levels available to users and additional reports (out of the
Reston Program Office that, with the international modules in
place), power levels may have actually dipped further.

Moorehead: "Well let me say that I think you're confusing some fact
with some opinion.  The baseline at assembly complete is
essentially 30KW for the users and 45KW to operate the Station.
Part of the Station operation, by the way, is power that we provide
to the users just to keep their facilities alive.  In my personnel
opinion, and this is opinion, is that the 45KW to operate the
Station and keep the users alive is excessive and so what we will
do with that, and what we've always done on programs such as this,
is that we scrub, we scrub, we scrub, we scrub...Now should we buy
the additional 12KW that would be available if we grew the solar
(arrays) then almost all of that could be dedicated to the user.
And that decision is not a technical decision.  It'll be a
budgetary decision, because certainly we can provide that
additional 12KW without any significant technical risks at all.  So
if the agency makes the budgetary decision to fund the growth of
the power modules by 3KW, then we have additional 12KW for the
users or whoever.  But there's nobody else that lays claim to it,
so it would be user power."

FUTURE CHALLENGES

SSN: There have been a lot of changes out here in terms of the
leadership of this program office in recent times.  Do you plan to
be around for a while and what do you see as the major challenges
which you will face this year?

Moorehead: "Well, (jokingly) I plan to be around for a while, but I
think everybody would have given you that answer.  I did not take
this on as a short-term activity.  I enjoy this sort of work and
it's sort of the only game in town.  So I plan to be here.  In
terms of the short-term challenges, they relate to the very things
we've been talking about.  And that is getting a good baseline
established and getting the resources allocated.  We have many
resources to allocate across the program.  We talked about one--
power.  And we've done power and we've done weight.  But we have
volume allocations to make, we have EVA (Extra-Vehicular
Activities) time allocations to make.  When we say that we can meet
the micro-g requirement--You start out if you had no disturbances
at all you would essentially have no accelerations, but you have
accelerations onboard the vehicle.  So one of the things that
(Station officials are working on) is to allocate how much
acceleration contributions can the Workpackage 3 elements make or
the Workpackage 2 elements and so forth.  So we have all those
sorts of resource allocations to make to set this program on a firm
footing so that we have a good set of ground rules.  And I think
that's a real challenge is to get the right ground rules, the right
requirements in place.  And they're second level requirements...but
they're requirements that have to be in place before you can go cut
metal and build a real spacecraft."
