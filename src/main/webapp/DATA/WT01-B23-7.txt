<p>The health and psychological consequences of cannabis use
chapter 2 </p>

<p>National Drug Strategy<br>
Monograph Series No. 25 <br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>2. Introduction <br>
</p>

<p>This review of the literature on the health and psychological
effects of cannabis was undertaken at the initiative of the
former Federal Justice Minister, Senator Michael Tate, who
requested a review of knowledge relating to cannabis, to inform
policy decisions. At Senator Tate's urging, a National Task Force
on Cannabis was established on 25 May 1992. The Task Force
commissioned this review of the evidence on the health and
psychological effects of cannabis use. A new and independent
review was thought necessary because there has not been any major
international review of the literature on the health and
psychological effects of cannabis since 1981, when the Addiction
Research Foundation and World Health Organization jointly
reviewed the literature. The purpose of this review was to update
the conclusions of earlier reviews in the light of research
undertaken during the past decade (ARF/WHO, 1981; Fehr and
Kalant, 1983). <br>
</p>

<p>2.1 Our approach to the literature </p>

<p>Our review of the literature was not intended to be, and could
not hope to be, as comprehensive as the major review undertaken
by the Addiction Research Foundation and the World Health
Organization. The literature is too large, and the diversity of
relevant disciplines represented in it beyond the expertise we
had available for the task. Unavoidably, we have relied upon
published expert opinion in the very many areas which lie outside
the authors' collective expertise, which is primarily in
epidemiology, psychopharmacology, neurophysiology and
neuropsychology. This fact is inevitably reflected in the
relative attention given to the literatures that lie within and
beyond our expertise. The literatures on the psychological
consequences of acute and chronic cannabis use, for example, are
much more comprehensively and critically reviewed than those
pertaining to effects on the reproductive and immune systems. In
reviewing the literature that lies outside our expertise, we have
relied upon the consensus views expressed in the literature by
experts in the relevant fields. When there has been controversy
between the experts we have explicitly acknowledged it. We have
checked our understanding and representation of these expert
views by asking Australian and international researchers with
expertise in the relevant fields to critically review what we
have written. <br>
