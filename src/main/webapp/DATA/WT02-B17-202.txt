<H3><a name="fault">Fault Current Limiter Team Reports Successful Test 
at Utility Substation</a></H3>

<P>

The participants in the DOE-funded Superconductivity Partnership 
Initiative 

fault current limiter (FCL) project have reported successful testing of 
a 2.4 

kilovolt, 2.2 kiloamp prototype. Lockheed Martin Corporation and its 
partners 

(Southern California Edison, American Superconductor Corporation, and 
Los 

Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)) tested the prototype for six weeks at 
a 

Southern California Edison substation, in a circuit where the normal 
operating 

current was 40 amperes. 

<P>

To test the prototype, the team intentionally created fault currents of 
about 

3100 amperes by shorting a transformer to ground.   The device responded 
within 

one-half cycle, limiting the first peak of the fault current by 52%.  
After the 

first peak, in steady state, the device limited the fault current by 
42%.  The 

prototype also demonstrated that it can intercept multiple fault 
currents; it 

successfully handled two 400-millisecond fault currents separated by 800 


milliseconds. Eddie Leung of Lockheed Martin said, "The fault current 
limiter 

demonstrated a level of performance which has real value for utilities.  
The 

fastest electromechanical circuit breakers take 3 to 5 cycles to 
respond, and 

the force associated with fault currents tends to be proportional to the 


square of the current."

<P>

"This demonstration is significant in that it shows that HTS wire and 
coil 

technology is advancing rapidly to meet the needs of the electric power 


industry," said Dr. Dean Peterson, Center Leader of the 
Superconductivity 

Technology Center at LANL.  He added, "Development of high performance, 
low 

cost current limiters will yield improved reliability, efficiency, and 
cost 

improvements for the electric utility industry."

<P>

Gary Dishaw of Southern California Edison (SCE) confirmed his company's 


interest: "SCE has been looking for a current limiter which would 
control 

surge currents but not interfere with normal power flow.  
Commercialization of 

superconducting fault current limiters will enable utilities to control 
surge 

currents, avoid costly upgrades, and protect expensive transmission and 


distribution equipment."

<P>

Leung said a full-scale commercial FCL would require a 15-kilovolt, 
11-kiloamp 

rating.  Dean Peterson of LANL pointed out that the performance of the 

superconducting wire is already good enough to achieve that rating.  Dr. 
Alonso 

Rodriguez, formerly an engineer with SCE and now a consultant to 
Lockheed 

Martin, said, "This device is simple, robust, and dependable.  It 
detects a 

fault current and automatically inserts a superconducting coil in series 
with 

the supply line.  The coil does not become resistive during the fault 
and 

therefore does not have to absorb any resistive heat.

<P>

"The device will limit fault currents to a value which the circuit 
breakers 

can handle safely.  Utilities will install it rather than splitting 
their buses 

or upgrading their breakers when the fault duty at a substation 
increases.  

<P>

"The fault current limiter will also improve power quality," Rodriguez 

explained.  "By minimizing current spikes, it will provide a more 
consistent 

power source for customers with sensitive equipment. 

<P>

"Furthermore, the device could enable utilities to import and export 
more 

power.  It will give them a stiffer, more robust system less susceptible 
to 

voltage and frequency disturbances.  For that reason, it will enable 
utilities 

to operate existing transmission lines closer to their thermal limits."

<P>

How will deregulation of the utility industry affect the future market 
for 

FCL's? Rodriguez said, "It depends on how deregulation plays out: it 
could 

tend to make the utility grids more interconnected or less 
interconnected.  If 

it makes them more interconnected, deregulation will increase the fault 


current levels and create an even greater need for this device."  Eddie 
Leung 

of Lockheed Martin pointed out that the DOE's Superconductivity 
Partnership 

Initiative had selected the FCL program for Phase II contract 
negotiations.  

The Phase II proposal described a two-year program with $7 million of 
total 

funding, including industry contributions.
