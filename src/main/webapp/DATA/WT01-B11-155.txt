<B>Ontario Parks - Paddling In A New Direction
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson said today that <I>Ontario Parks</I> made significant gains during its first six months of operation.<P>

I am impressed with how quickly <I>Ontario Parks</I> has delivered on commitments made less than a year ago,  Mr. Hodgson said.   In particular, it has made solid improvements in the areas of customer service, facilities and partnerships. <P>

Mr. Hodgson announced the new <I>Ontario Parks</I> structure for the provincial parks system on May 1, 1996.<P>

<I>Ontario Parks</I> has two basic objectives.  One is to maintain and protect Ontario s world renowned 265 parks and irreplaceable natural and cultural heritage.  The other objective is to manage parks more efficiently.  This includes providing opportunities for involvement by partners and by the private sector to allow the parks system to continue to prosper in a challenging fiscal environment.<P>

Key areas where <I>Ontario Parks</I> has made significant progress include:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating More Parks</B> - Through many partnerships, new nature reserve parks are being considered, including Wainfleet Bog, Calder Island, Shaw Woods, Lyal Island, Carden Alvar, Holland River Fens and Alfred Bog, as well as selected Carolinian forest and Great Lake sites.<P>

<LI><B>Enhancing Existing Parks</B> - In Algonquin, after successful negotiations with CN Rail in 1996, a 128-km rail line right-of-way running through the park has been added to the park s landbase.  Under a proposal now in the final stages of public review, Wabakimi Provincial Park would be expanded from 155,000 hectares to almost 900,000 hectares, and MNR is committed to regulating the new boundary early in 1997.  And in 1996, Massasauga became the newest operating provincial park, with 135 interior camp sites, sheltered bay and coves.<P>

<LI><B>Facility Improvements</B> - <I>Ontario Parks</I> has made some good business investments to upgrade existing facilities, such as the addition of 1,162 new Hydro sites to the parks system.  This resulted in an additional $800,000 in revenue during the 1996 season.  At Balsam Lake, for instance, 64 sites were converted to electricity, for an increase of $22,000 in revenue.  And at Mississagi, a co-op project with Ontario Hydro resulted in the installation of $50,000 worth of solar equipment and storage battery packs to operate lights and power in the park.  Also, new campgrounds are being constructed in parks including Sandbanks and Bass Lake.<P>

<LI><B>Customer Service</B> - <I>Ontario Parks</I> is reaching out and delivering information and services in new and effective ways.  In particular, our <A HREF="http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/parks/index.html">Web site</A> on the Internet is a resounding success, with close to 20,000 hits in its first six months.  People now have access to more information directly from home, in addition to interactive functions and games related to parks and the many opportunities they offer.  An excellent opportunity for unlimited use of provincial parks is provided by our new season permits, at $30.00 for the 1996-97 winter permit and $40.00 for the summer permit.  Convenient and economical, they also make great gifts.  And to serve more visitors, many parks now offer facilities accessible to persons with disabilities, while some parks also offer rental accommodation such as permanent tent-like structures called  yurts , and renovated park lodges and cabins.<P>

<LI><B>Partnerships</B> - More than 100 responses have been received to a prospectus sent to businesses earlier this year to develop major corporate partnerships.  Meanwhile, under existing partnerships with the private sector and community groups, many provincial parks, including Pakwash, Killarney, Peters Woods and Lake Nipigon, are already showing signs of 
increased activity.<P>
</UL>
Based on what has been achieved to date, I am more confident than ever that <I>Ontario Parks</I> will ensure the parks system continues to be a provincial showcase, enhancing tourism and business objectives for Ontario,  Mr. Hodgson added.<P>

<I>Ontario Parks</I> is accountable to the Minister through a soon-to-be appointed board of directors, and oversees a special purpose account for retaining and managing parks revenues.<P>
