  Target Audience: Teachers; Practitioners<BR>
  This book contains 450 strategies for starting or improving programs for 
including students with disabilities in regular classrooms.  Consideration is 
first given to developing a plan for inclusion, grouping students, using 
assistants for the student groups, scheduling, presenting the inclusion plan, 
training staff, setting up an inclusion classroom, and working as a team.  
Specific classroom and curriculum modifications are then discussed, including 
modifications to textbooks and novels, daily assignments, spelling and written 
language, mathematics strategies, oral and written directions, oral 
presentations, note-taking, and grading.  Suggestions are offered for creating 
audiocassettes, providing additional support for students with hearing and 
vision impairments, modifying the environment for students with attention 
deficit disorder, and dealing with behavior and attention difficulties as well 
as impulsivity and distractibility.  Appended are 21 worksheets and 
reproducible forms to survey teachers, parents, and students; gather student 
data; develop a schedule; develop curriculum modifications; and carry out other 
administrative activities.  (SW)<BR>

  This textbook emphasizes practical guidelines and approaches that work with 
special students mainstreamed into regular classrooms.  The background of the 
mainstream and inclusion movements and labeling practices is considered, along 
with specific exceptionalities and methods effective in teaching children who 
have learning disabilities, mental handicaps, behavior problems, physical 
impairments, visual impairments, and hearing impairments.  The book then covers 
the concept, practice, and components of the Individualized Education Plan, 
including teamwork in planning and implementation.  Classroom organization and 
management techniques are addressed, including behavior management and the 
affective components of learning, attitudes, and how to communicate teacher 
expectations.  The final chapters address basic skill areas, including: 
identification of reading difficulties, reading strategies, oral and written 
language, spelling, handwriting, mathematics assessment tools, mathematics 
instructional content, and techniques for helping children with special 
learning needs in math.  The potential of technology to meet the increasing 
diversity in the general education setting is also addressed.  Step-by-step 
suggestions and classroom vignettes are included, along with a glossary.  (Each 
chapter contains references.) (SW)<BR>

  Responsible inclusion of students with learning disabilities in regular 
education involves putting the student first, allowing teachers to self-select 
their involvement in inclusion, providing adequate resources, developing school-
based inclusive models, maintaining a continuum of services, offering 
professional development, developing an inclusion philosophy, and refining 
curriculum approaches and service delivery to meet all students' needs.  (JDD)<BR>

  This study evaluated the short-term and long-term effects of three variants
of a case-by-case process for readying students with learning disabilities to
move successfully from resource rooms to regular classrooms for math
instruction.  Twenty-seven special educators from 21 elementary and middle
schools and their 47 students with learning disabilities were assigned randomly
to one of three experimental conditions or a control group.  In the
experimental conditions, students were prepared for the transition by use of
curriculum-based measurement and transenvironmental programming, each alone and
in combination.  Educational placement, math achievement, and student attitudes
about reintegration were assessed in special and regular education settings.
Teachers using the more complex and labor-intensive variants of the case-by-
case process were more successful at moving students across settings and
fostering greater math achievement and positive attitude change, especially
while the students were still in special education.  Nevertheless, at 1-year
follow-up, about half of the 47 students had never been integrated or were
moved to the mainstream temporarily, only to be returned to special education.
One reason for the relatively high return rate may have been that reintegrated
students' math achievement slowed considerably in the mainstream.  Implications
are discussed.  Study data are presented in nine tables and one figure.

  This bulletin summarizes research on the benefits of inclusive education
programs; provides data on the current status of special education; and
considers studies of individual inclusion programs, state and district studies,
and the effects of inclusion on students without disabilities.  The research
and evaluation data on inclusion indicate a strong trend toward improved
student outcomes (academic, behavior, and social) for both special education
and general education students.  It is suggested that the drive for upgrading
standards and the inclusion of all students in these reforms has created
tension for educators.  A point of congruence between the school effectiveness
efforts and those promoting inclusion is that a new approach must become part
of a restructured educational system.  Districts conducting successful
restructuring programs that include all students have identified the following
key factors: visionary leadership; collaboration; refocused use of assessment;
supports for staff and students; funding that is sufficient and "follows the
student," and effective parent and family involvement.  (Contains 57

  Describes innovative, inclusive models for providing special education
services for learning-disabled students developed by three universities and
funded by the Office of Special Education.  The projects, involving
considerable financial and professional resources, were implemented at six
restructuring elementary schools.  Findings suggest that general education
settings produce achievement outcomes for learning-disabled students that are
neither desirable nor acceptable.  (41 references) (MLH)<BR>

  Although research is limited, the available studies consistently indicate
that inclusion does not harm nondisabled students.  A literature review
disclosed five positive themes: reduced fear of human differences, accompanied
by increased comfort and awareness; growth in social cognition; improvements in
self-concept; development of personal moral and ethical principles; and warm
and caring friendship.  (26 references) (MLH)<BR>

  Summarizes recent research concerning inclusion's (generally positive)
effects on student learning and social relations with classmates.  Three meta-
analyses address the most-effective-setting issue by generating a common
measure, an effect size.  These effect sizes demonstrate a small-to-moderate
beneficial influence of inclusive education on special-needs children' academic
and social outcomes.  (11 references) (MLH)<BR>
