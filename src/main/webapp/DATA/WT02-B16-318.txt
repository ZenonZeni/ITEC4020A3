<P>

We are studying hybrid vehicles that have high power-train efficiencies 
and optimized 

hydrogen engines that are projected to have efficiencies of 45% or more 
with extremely low 

emissions.  The relatively low efficiency of the conventional power 
train (approximately 18%) 

and modest efficiency of current gasoline-fueled spark ignition engines 
(with a peak efficiency of 

about 32%) opens the door for hydrogen as a realistic near-term 
transportation fuel.  For this to 

happen, we must develop an automobile that has a comparable fuel cost 
per mile and lower 

emissions.  We are studying hydrogen hybrid vehicles that meet the goals 
of the next generation 

of vehicles (with a fuel efficiency of 80 miles per gallon equivalent 
and a 380-mile range).  Our 

results indicate that such a vehicle appears feasible with an optimized 
hydrogen engine.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I>:</b>

<P>

The experimental engine data obtained at Sandia National Laboratories

have been analyzed and the results have been used for validating

and adjusting the parameters on the heat transfer correlation

used in the simplified, zero-dimensional (lumped) engine model.

 Good agreement has been obtained between the model and the experimental


results.

<P>

The validated engine model has been extended to include a friction

model and a supercharger model, so that the engine model can be

used in predicting engine brake thermal efficiency (net work 
output/chemical

energy input).  Supercharging is necessary for increasing the

power output of the engine, which would otherwise be very limited

due to the low equivalence ratio.  The extended model has also

been used in generating an engine performance map.  It is assumed

that an automotive engine is built with four cylinders like the

cylinders of an Onan engine.  The engine has almost 2 liters of

displacement, and can be used in conventional and hybrid vehicles.

<P>

A conventional vehicle has only one degree of freedom for controlling

the output torque at any given speed:  the inlet manifold pressure.

 A hydrogen engine has two degrees of freedom, because equivalence

ratio can also be varied.  Generating an engine map therefore

requires specifying a control strategy that states how to adjust

these two parameters to obtain the desired torque for a given

engine speed.  In this analysis, an optimizer is used to determine

the combination of equivalence ratio and inlet manifold pressure

that satisfies the torque requirement while providing the maximum

engine brake thermal efficiency.  Engine NO<sub>x</sub> emissions are 
restricted

to less than 10 ppm under all operating conditions.  An engine

generating 10 ppm of NO<sub>x</sub> is within the proposed CARB EZEV 
standards

if it is installed in a vehicle with a fuel economy of 40 mpg

or higher.  Engine efficiency remains reasonably high as torque

is decreased, because the low power can be obtained by reducing

equivalence ratio rather than throttling, reducing the pumping

losses.  The engine can be applied to both a conventional car

and a series hybrid car.  Either of these vehicles should have

a high efficiency and low (well under EZEV) emissions.
