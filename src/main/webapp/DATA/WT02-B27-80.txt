<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Sample Lesson Plans<BR>
for Cooperative Learning</H2>

<HR> 
Cooperative learning can be used with some confidence at every grade level, in every subject area, and with any task.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="CoopRef#Sherritt">Sherritt (1989)</A> provides the following sample cooperative learning lesson plans for ABE and ESL classes. The three topics are: (a) cultural plurality, (b) community social services, and (c) biology.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Group Learning Goal</H3>

<STRONG>Sample 1:</STRONG> A Cultural Lesson: Identify the behaviors in a designated story that illustrate cultural conditioning.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 2:</STRONG> A Lesson on Community Social Services: Write and present to the class a group report on community social services.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 3</STRONG>: A Biology Lesson: Identify the characteristics of a prokaryotic cell.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Group Processes Goal</H3>

<STRONG>Sample 1:</STRONG> Practice good listening techniques<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 2:</STRONG> Use conflict resolution skills<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 3:</STRONG> Practice making eye contact.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Individual Goals</H3>
(Individual assignments can be adapted individual levels so that each member contributes to the group goal and experiences a measure of success according to his/her abilities)<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 1:</STRONG> After reading the story, each individual will identify illustrated cultural behaviors that conform to or conflict with his/her own.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 2:</STRONG> Each group member will research one community social service, acquiring information to share with the group.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 3:</STRONG> Each member will have a different cell characteristic to research and to teach to the other members<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Roles</H3>

For all samples:<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Recorder records important points from the group discussions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Leader keeps the discussion going by ensuring that everyone participates and no one dominates.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Reporter reports group progress to the entire class<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Synthesizer sums up what is being discussed
</OL>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Evaluation/Products</H3>

<STRONG>Sample 1:</STRONG> Each group will submit a matrix of cultural behaviors evident in the story and their relation to the cultures of group members. Evaluation will be based on cohesiveness of the matrix and accuracy of individual responses.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 2:</STRONG> Each group of four will submit a cogent, well-written report on four local social service agencies. The group will serve as a panel, with each member presenting to the class information on his/her research. Evaluation will be based on cohesiveness of the report and the quality of information (verbal and written) provided by the panel.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sample 3:</STRONG> Individuals within groups will complete a test on the characteristics of prokaryotic cells. Individual grades will be tallied and feed into a composite group grade<BR>
