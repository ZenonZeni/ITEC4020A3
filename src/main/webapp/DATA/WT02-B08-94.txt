<H1>PLEASURE BEHIND BAD EATING<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
SOME sufferers from eating disorders appeared to be &quot;pleasure addicts&quot;,
an Italian psychiatrist, Professor Alessandro Bandecchi, said in Melbourne
today.<BR>
<BR>
Tests were being conducted in Italy, Canada and New Zealand to discover
whether this addiction could be corrected with drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Bandecchi is director of the Neurosciences Institute, Arezzo University,
Italy. He is attending the World Congress of CINP (Collegium Internationale
Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum).<BR>
<BR>
Social pressures alone could not explain why some girls and women risked
starving themselves to death (anorexia nervosa) or indulged in binge-eating
followed by forced vomiting (bulimia).<BR>
<BR>
Fashion magazines and other media encouraged excessive thinness, but anorexia
had been prevalent long before the existence of the mass media -- in medieval
Italy, for example. <BR>
<BR>
Studies of anorexic and bulimic girls showed changes in the brain that indicated
addictive pleasure was derived from abnormal eating habits. This was similar
to the biochemical effects on the brain of extreme exertion by athletes
and joggers.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Bandecchi said he had no explanation for the trend, especially
since World War II, for some girls to starve themselves into a shape that
was the complete opposite of what most men found sexually desirable.<BR>
<BR>
It was possible that the studies of brain changes related to the eating
habits of hibernating animals might reveal genetic factors behind anorexia
and bulimia.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Bandecchi said anorexia was the only known disease that sufferers
could use to kill themselves. It affected one per cent of the population,
and three per cent of its sufferers died. <BR>
<BR>
It disrupted family life to such an extent that a man in Italy had recently
killed his anorexic daughter.<BR>
