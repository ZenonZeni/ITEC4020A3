<h2>The Impact of the Act on the Internet</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>95.  Because of the realities of the Internet, the Act
effects a total ban on certain constitutionally protected speech
to adults.  The Act reduces discourse on major portions of the
Internet to that which is appropriate for a young child.

<p>96.  Virtually all of the tens of millions of users of
the Internet -- except those who at all times stand mute in the
discourse that occurs on the Internet -- are content providers
who are subject to the terms of the Act.  An individual is a
content provider subject to the Act if he sends a single e-mail,
or participates in a listserv discussion, or contributes to a
USENET newsgroup, or responds to a survey on the World Wide Web,
or establishes a personal "home page" on the Web, or converses
with a friend through a real time service, or simply places a
file in a publicly available area of a computer or network.  

<p>97.  In other words, virtually any use of the Internet
makes someone a content provider subject to the criminal
penalties of the Act.  Commercial content providers -- who
typically require a credit card for users' payment -- may be able
to use the credit card defense allowed by the Act.  But for non-
commercial content providers, who are responsible for a major
part of communications on the Internet, there is no practical way
the speaker can control who can access the message.  Thus, for
the vast majority of speech on the Internet, it is impossible for
the speaker to prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in a
manner available" to a person under 18.  Act &#167; 502(2).

<p>98.  Because of this impossibility, Section 502(2) of
the Act effectively requires that almost all discourse on the
Internet be at a level suitable for young children.  This
provision has the effect of a flat ban on an entire category of
constitutionally protected speech between adults.

<p>99.  As used by millions of people daily, the primary
methods to access information on the Internet do not permit
individual or non-commercial content providers to control who on
the Internet can access their content.  From the perspective of
the content provider, information that is publicly available on
the Internet is available to all users of the Internet, even
users who might be minors.  

<p>100.  None of the major methods of accessing
information -- including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups,
chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher, and the World Wide Web -- has
the ability to track the millions of individuals who access the
Internet and screen out those who are under eighteen years of
age.  Although password-required access to content is possible
(and is used in some circumstances), a password-access system
would effectively remove from public access an enormous volume of
valuable content on the Internet, and would reduce the
information available to adults on the Internet to only content
deemed suitable for minors.

<p>101.  The vast majority of content providers on the
Internet are individuals who post messages to newsgroups and
listservs, and who create content on the World Wide Web.  Those
individual content providers could not possibly create and
maintain a database of specific Internet users who request access
to the content and who prove they are 18 or older.  Nor could
individuals or other non-commercial content providers practically
administer or economically afford an instantaneous credit card
verification system.  Such a requirement would effectively
preclude any communications by those content providers that could
be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors.

<p>102.  Even larger organizations that provide content on
the Internet cannot practically or economically track the
millions of Internet users to determine whether those users are
minors or adults.  

<p>103.  Moreover, even if pre-registration by content
users were practically or economically possible, the value of the
content would be dramatically diminished because so few content
users would anticipate the need to pre-register for a particular
site.  A huge percentage of Internet traffic is by users engaged
in spontaneous and unpredictable research or searches for
content, and a pre-registration requirement would effectively end
this type of search. 

<p>104.  As described above, the World Wide Web is a
spontaneous and serendipitous communications medium, in which a
user can jump from site to site to site depending on what content
looks most useful or interesting, without any pre-registration or
advance request.  Requiring pre-registration for all sites that
might contain content arguably covered by the Act (if such pre-
registration were practically possible) would drastically reduce
the usefulness of the World Wide Web.

<p>105.  For other methods of providing content on the
Internet, it is flatly impossible for a content provider to
control who can access the content.  With USENET newsgroups, for
example, once a content provider posts a message to a newsgroup,
that message is automatically distributed to over 190,000
computers around the world, and the individual content provider
has no ability whatsoever to control who is permitted to access
the content on those 190,000 computers.  Under the Act, all
content posted to USENET newsgroups must be reduced to a level
appropriate for young children.  Similarly, Internet mailing list
services such as "listserv" also do not allow the speaker to
control who receives the communication, and thus speech via a
mailing list service would also be reduced to the level
appropriate for young children.
