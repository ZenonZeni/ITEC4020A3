<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Can I Get All the Information About My Illness on the Web?</H1>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>(Why Do I Need You?)</H2>



<HR SIZE=6>



<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Web offers a great deal of information for just about any type of illness.<BR>

However, it does not offer access to the key databases<BR>

for up-to-date medical developments in cancer treatment.</H3>



<P><STRONG>The National Library of Medicine's Cancerlit and Medline databases are available only to subscribers who pay usage fees.</STRONG>  The National Cancer Institute's Clinical Trials database too, is not accessible via the World Wide Web.  However, the PDQ overview sections (for patients and for medical professionals) are available on the Web by accessing <A HREF="http://imsdd.meb.uni-bonn.de/cancernet/cancernet.html">Cancernet.</A></P>



<P>Someday, the National Library of Medicine may develop user friendly software and  make their databases free to use on the Net.  Someday, the PDQ Clinical database may be free to use.  However, as of today both databases require subscriptions and user fees, and the former <STRONG>also requires knowledge of an esoteric command language for effective searching.</STRONG></P>



<H4>The promise of the Net is real to be sure.  However, it is not yet the omnipotent information gathering tool that it is cracked up to be.  It can be very useful for finding medical information as long as one understands its current pitfalls and its limitations:</H4>





<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH=75%>



<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Searching Capabilities</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>From <A HREF="garybook.html"><I>Cancer Cure</I></A> by <A HREF="gstory.html">Gary Schine</A></H3>



<P><STRONG>Key benefits of the sophisticated medical databases (like Medline and Cancerlit) include their deliberate and meticulous indexing.</STRONG>  Medical librarians  dissect articles categorizing them by controlled vocabulary terms-- sometimes twenty or thirty such terms for one article.  This indexing makes it possible to search with reasonable precision.  If I wanted to find articles on, for example, multiple myeloma treatment, published in 1995 through 1996, involving the use of radiation therapy, I could easily limit to these parameters (as well as to many others).  The database would dutifully provide exactly the information that I requested.</P>



<P><STRONG>The Internet has no such trained indexers.</STRONG>  No Net indexing to date can hold a candle to the indexing done by the staffs of Medline, Cancerlit or by other controlled databases.  The Internet, particularly the World Wide Web, does offer <I>search engines</I> that utilize keyword search capabilities.  That means a Web user can ask one of the search engines for information on "multiple myeloma".  Such a request would pull up hundreds of retrievals.  However, their usability and relevance would be hit or miss, in that they might include items on the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as reviews of novels where a character within suffers from the illness, to the obituary of people who succumbed to the illness.</P>



<P>While such a search might well produce a host of <I>false hits,</I> or items that match the technical search criteria but do not match the search goals, it might very well miss important information that does not meet the keyword criteria.  For example, multiple myeloma is a type of a plasma cell neoplasm.  An article on treatment of all plasma cell neoplasms that does not specifically mention multiple myeloma would be missed by a keyword-based search engine.</P>





<P>The Internet is to controlled medical databases what a book flea market is to a research library.  You may find some wonderful bits of information, but <STRONG>you cannot assume that you have done a systematic search merely by surfing the Net using your illness as  a key word search term.</STRONG>  Further, evaluating information found--sifting the quackery from the legitimate science-- can be as difficult as it is important.</P>





<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH=75%>



<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Uncontrolled Access to the Internet</H2>



<P>A key advantage of the Internet in general is a key drawback, when it comes to seeking out information as important as treatment of a serious illness.  The Net is essentially an electronic democracy where anyone can post and present to the public pretty much whatever he or she would like.  <STRONG>No one acts as editor or review committee.</STRONG>  If I want to announce on the World Wide Web that a new brand of grape juice cures colon cancer, I can easily do so, as can anyone else with Net access.  What's more, my posting on grape juice would be on apparently equal footing with postings from the world's most venerable medical journals.  In point of fact, there are quacks selling all sorts of snake oil on the Net, further increasing its perils as an information gathering tool.</P>



<P><STRONG>The general public, however, is not able to add to the controlled medical databases.  Entries are controlled by strict parameters,</STRONG> essentially limited to medical and scientific journals, and related publications and documents.  Further, source and reference information which adheres to scientific and academic documentation standards  is included in the medical databases.  Virtually all the medical information in medical databases is referenced and documented such that a user can readily  know where that information came from and who provided it.  If such reference information is provided with items found on the Internet it is for the most part voluntary and unverified.</P>



<P><STRONG>The Net can be quite useful for finding anecdotal information, for finding emotional support from those who have been there, and for pointing one in the direction of available resources.  Currently, it is not a great resource for systematically searching out documented scientific studies or legitimate clinical trials.</STRONG></P>
