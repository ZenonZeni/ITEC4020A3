<h1>Total Quality Management:<br> What’s in it for Schools?</h1>

<p><b>Robert "Mick" McNiel</b>
 
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Editor’s note: This article gives further
insight into what is meant by "quality education" discussed in the
related article, <a href="bishop.html">"Quality Education for Teachers and 
Special Education Students"</a>.</font>

<p>Many superintendents, teachers, and local business leaders are
studying the concept of total quality and its focus on continuous
improvement within their organizations.

<p>Most school districts are vigorously involved in numerous
transformational efforts, such as site-based management, outcome
assessments, and strategic planning. Is Total Quality Management another 
educational program that needs to be added to the already filled plate of
educators? The answer may lie in the fact that much of what we are
currently doing is part of the concept imbedded in the quality 
movement.

<p>Many might speculate that they are already working long hours, have
been doing an excellent job for years, and, if people would just leave
them alone, they could get on with what they were hired for the 
education of children. 

<p>One might also suggest that everyone in education is doing an
outstanding job, but the threats to public education as we know it might
encourage us to re-evaluate services offered. Today’s educational 
challenges include: 
<ul>
  <li>school choice 
  <li>public funds used for the benefit of   private schools 
  <li>private vendors hired to take over educational school systems
  <li>millions spent by businesses on employee retraining
  <li><i>Channel One</i> programming 
  <li><i>Hooked on Phonics</i> materials 
</ul>
<p><b>The Impact of Total Quality Management (TQM)</b><br>
How can the concepts of Total Quality Management help us? First of all,
we need to understand that TQM is not a program; it is a value-based,
information-driven process for continuous improvement. (Even Dr. 
W. Edwards Deming, one of the originators tied to the quality movement,
responded negatively to the terminology of TQM. He stated, "There is no
such thing as a Total Quality Management program. Our focus should be on
<b>quality enhancement.</b>")  

<p>So what is quality? Quality is perceived by the customer; the job of
the school system is to know customer needs on a daily basis. Educators
have difficulty with the term customer, but basically it refers to 
someone who has benefited from your work both internally and externally.
Internally, customers might refer to the district administration,
faculty, and staff. External customers are the students, parents, 
businesses, community, and even the Board of Education. 

<p><b>Plan, Do, Study, Act</b><br>
Now that your customers are defined, what’s next? In actuality, it comes down to a plan, do, study, act 
cycle that allows individuals to: 

<ol>

<li>Continually plan for improvement. 

<li>Carry out improvement plans. 
 
<li>Utilize measurement tools to study customer needs in relation to
improvement plans.

<li>Continually improve the processes that exceed customer needs. 
</ol>

<p>In other words, what’s good enough for today is not good enough for
tomorrow. Total Quality Management focuses on the processes and
continually improves those processes rather than looking at the 
end result and blaming people for it. It gives people the ability to
break down barriers that prevent them from working well together and
sharing information. It helps them to focus on problems rather than finger 
pointing. 

<p>The hard part of TQM, according to Dr. James Leonard, a consultant in
Deming philosophy, is creating an environment in which students,
teachers, staff, and parents will accept and fulfill their new 
roles correctly, effectively, comfortably, and without fear. 

<p><b>The Deming Philosophy</b><br>
Managers in manufacturing and business organizations receive useful
guidance for creating the environment from 14 principles developed and
taught by Dr. W. Edwards Deming over the past several decades. These
principles are often referred to as The Deming Philosophy. 

<p>We all recognize the problems we face in our schools. we all want to
see changes and improvements. The issue becomes one of how to accomplish
these changes. Total Quality Management may not have all the answers, but
additional study of Dr. Deming’s principles might provide a school
district a sound road map for accomplishing desired changes and
improvements.    

<blockquote>
<b>'The Deming Philosophy': <br>
14 Points Restated for School Boards and Administration: </b>
<ol>

<li>Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of the entire school
system and its services. 

<li>Adopt a new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. 

<li>Cease dependence on tests and grades to measure quality. 

<li>Cease dependence on price when selecting curriculum, texts,
equipment, and supplies for the district. 

<li>Improve constantly and forever every process for planning, teaching,
learning, and service. 

<li>Institute a more thorough, better job related training. 

<li>Drive out fear. 

<li>Break down barriers between groups in the school system. 

<li>Eliminate the use of goals, targets, and slogans to encourage performance. 

<li>Closely examine the impact of teaching standards and the system of
grading student performance. 

<li>Remove barriers that rob staff and administration of pride of workmanship and rob students of the job 
of learning. 

<li>Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for
everyone in the system. 

<li>Plan and take action to accomplish the transformation. 
</ol>
