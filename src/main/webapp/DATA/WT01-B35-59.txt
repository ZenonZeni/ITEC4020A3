<h2>Preface</h2>

<hr>

<p> In The Doors of Perception Aldous Huxley has given us a
superbly written account of the effects of mescaline upon a
highly sensitive person. It was a record of his first experience
of this remarkable transformation of consciousness, and by now,
through subsequent experiments, he knows that it can lead to far
deeper insights than his book described. While I cannot hope to
surpass Aldous Huxley as a master of English prose, I feel that
the time is ripe for an account of some of the deeper, or higher,
levels of insight that can be reached through these
consciousness-changing &quot;drugs&quot; when accompanied with
sustained philosophical reflection by a person who is in search,
not of kicks, but of understanding. I should perhaps add that,
for me, philosophical reflection is barren when divorced from
poetic imagination, for we proceed to understanding of the world
upon two legs, not one. </p>

<p> It is now a commonplace that there is a serious lack of
communication between scientists and laymen on the theoretical
level, for the layman does not understand the mathematical
language in which the scientist thinks. For example, the concept
of curved space cannot be represented in any image that is
intelligible to the senses. But I am still more concerned with
the gap between theoretical description and direct experience
among scientists themselves. Western science is now delineating a
new concept of man, not as a solitary ego within a wall of flesh,
but as an organism which is what it is by virtue of its
inseparability from the rest of the world. But with the rarest
exceptions even scientists do not <i>feel</i> themselves to exist
in this way. They, and almost all of us, retain a sense of
personality which is independent, isolated, insular, and
estranged from the cosmos that surrounds it. Somehow this gap
must be closed, and among the varied means whereby the closure
may be initiated or achieved are medicines which science itself
has discovered, and which may prove to be the sacraments of its
religion. </p>

<p> For a long time we have been accustomed to the
compartmentalization of religion and science as if they were two
quite different and basically unrelated ways of seeing the world.
I do not believe that this state of doublethink can last. It must
eventually be replaced by a view of the world which is neither
religious nor scientific but simply our view of the world. More
exactly, it must become a view of the world in which the reports
of science and religion are as concordant as those of the eyes
and the ears. </p>

<p> But the traditional roads to spiritual experience seldom
appeal to persons of scientific or skeptical temperament, for the
vehicles that ply them are rickety and piled with excess baggage.
There is thus little opportunity for the alert and critical
thinker to share at first hand in the modes of consciousness that
seers and mystics are trying to express-often in archaic and
awkward symbolism. If the pharmacologist can be of help in
exploring this unknown world, he may be doing us the
extraordinary service of rescuing religious experience from the
obscurantists. </p>

<p> To make this book as complete an expression as possible of
the quality of consciousness which these drugs induce, I have
included a number of photographs which, in their vivid reflection
of the patterns of nature, give some suggestion of the rhythmic
beauty of detail which the drugs reveal in common things. For
without losing their normal breadth of vision the eyes seem to
become a microscope through which the mind delves deeper and
deeper into the intricately dancing texture of our world. </p>
