<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
Fifth, the U.S. has enjoyed a five year bull market in stocks and bonds which
has produced tremendous gains in household wealth as well as opportunities for
entrepreneurial companies to raise capital.  At the peak in June, the ratio of
stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. was about $7 trillion or 91% of
GDP.  This was the highest since 1929, when the market was worth about 81% of
GDP.  The stock market boom has added $2 billion to household net worth since
1984.  It also has permitted an extraordinary boom in new equity public
offerings and corporate fund raising through the sale of non-investment grade
bonds. The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the first half of 1996
compared to 470 during 1995, 599 during 1994, and a peak of 689 during 1993.
These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during the first half of 1996
compared to $27.7 billion last year, $27.7 billion during 1994 and $39.2
billion during 1993.  The peak for I.P.O. financing during the 1980's, by
contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986.  The search for higher yields also has
helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market.  In the first half of
1996, Wall Street sold 108 new non-investment grade bond offering compared to
159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993.  The funds raised were
$20 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during 1995, $231.5
billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993.  The previous peak in
non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billion during
1986.  The ability of small and medium sized companies to obtain so much
capital from the stock market has helped to encourage the high growth rate of
investment and employment since 1993.<p>
<p>
The stock market boom has also been accompanied by a dramatic expansion of the
mutual fund industry and new forms of retirement savings, such as defined
contribution pension plans which could encourage an impovement in the national
savings rate.  The mutual fund industry now has assets of over $3 trillion
compared to $4.2 trillion in the banking system and nearly one third of mutual
fund assets are in long-term savings programs.  There is some evidence that
defined contribution pension plans have a more positive impact on household
savings during periods of rising equity prices than the traditional defined
benefit pension plans.  Under defined contribution plans, there is no penalty
for households to maintain a steady flow of savings into their retirement
programs as asset prices rise whereas corporations which overfund their pension
plans penalize profits and attract corporate raiders.  In 1995, the household
savings rate in the U.S. rose despite the boom in equity prices.  The uptick in
the savings rate may have resulted from the shift towards greater use of
defined contribution pension system.  The growth of defined contibution savings
could accelerate further if the White House and Congress ever agree to
privatize social security.<p>
<p>
Sixth, the U.S. economy has been a major economic beneficiary of the end of the
cold war and the acceptance of liberal economic ideas by many formerly
communist or mercantilist countries.  The U.S. sends about one third of its
exports to developing countries and during the past five years these markets
have accounted for over two thirds of all export growth.  In 1995, this export
growth slowed because of the financial crisis in Mexico and its spillover
effects on other Latin American countries.  But the IMF-U.S. Treasury rescue
program for Mexico helped to stabilize her financial system and has set the
stage for a recovery this year.  The ability of Mexico to avoid default also
helped to lessen the impact of her crises on other developing countries,
especially in Latin America.<p>
<p>
Finally, the general mix of macroeconomic policy in all the major industrial
nations since 1992 has been supportive of non-inflationary growth.  European
governments have been attempting to reduce their budget deficits by trimming
their public spending. The counterpart to this deficit reduction has been a
large decline in the level of both short-term and long-term interest rates.
Japan has been an outlier to the process of deficit reduction because of the
impact of her  banking crisis on the economy.  But the Bank of Japan has
nevertheless cut short-term interest rates to only 50 basis points in order to
help prop up the financial system.  The current level of interest rates in
Japan is the lowest to occur in any industrial country since the Great
Depression of the 1930's.<p>
<p>
The challenge now confronting Federal Reserve policy makers is to sustain the
expansion by finding a rate of growth which is consistent with the economy's
underlying supply side potential.  There are many points of view on the level
of growth which is optimal for the economy but the Federal Reserve perceives
that the number is about 2.0-2.5% once the economy achieves full employment.
As the economy enjoyed 4.0-5.0% output growth during the second quarter and is
probably expanding at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the current quarter, the
odds are high that there could be Federal Reserve tightening during the next
few months to slow the economy's rate of growth.  In fact, a rate hike during
late August is very likely  unless the upcoming data for employment costs shows
a reversal of the uptick which became apparent during the first quarter.<p>
<p>
As inflation expectations are still under control, it is doubtful that the Fed
will raise interest rates by more than 50 basis points this year but there will
be no way to predict the peak until the economy actually slows.  Another
wildcard in the outlook is the lending policies of the credit card companies.
The credit card companies have been so permissive in permitting low income
households to gain access to cards that their stock of non-performing loans has
risen sharply.  If they suddenly curtail access to cards by imposing more
stringent lending quality screens, they will depress consumer spending by lower
income Americans (who account for about 10% of the total).<p>
<p>
A policy of Federal Reserve fine tuning will not cause any sudden or abrupt
changes in the economy's performance this autumn but it could produce a
correction in the equity market.  In fact, the equity market has been very
turbulent during the past four weeks because of investor concern about both
monetary policy and the economic policy risks poised by this autumn's election.
<p>
<p>
Investors are concerned about monetary tightening because they fear it could
set the stage for a profit squeeze next year.  With wages rising in response to
tight labor markets, corporations will find it more difficult to sustain their
profit margins, especially if Fed tightening slows the economy's growth rate.
In 1994, by contrast, the Fed had tightened to reduce upward pressure on
commodity prices, not wages.  Rising commodity prices redistributed income
within the corporate sector whereas rising wages reduce the profit share of
national income.<p>
<p>
Investor confidence also has been depressed by the extremely poor performance
of Robert Dole in the opinion polls. Wall Street has long perceived President
Clinton to be a superior campaigner but they had expected Dole to benefit from
Clinton's scandals in the "emerging market" state of Arkansas as well as his
own retirement from the Senate.  With Mr. Dole still 15-20 points behind in the
opinion polls, investors are becoming apprehensive about the risk of the
Republicans losing control of the Congress, not just the race for the White
House.<p>
<p>
The prospect of the Republicans losing control of the Congress is disturbing to
Wall Street for several reasons.<p>
<p>
First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for both parties.
No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections since Franklin
Roosevelt in the 1930's.  The Republican Party has not controlled the Congress
for  two consecutive terms since the 1920's.  If the Republicans lose control
again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away from their
themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, and
promoting lower marginal income tax rates.<p>
<p>
Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the Democratic
Party in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories.  The
Republican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southern
Confederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960.  On the basis of
pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claim
control over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if they
lose their overall majority.  As a result of the Republican takeover of the
south, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of the
northeast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.
This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that future
Democratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spending
programs and other forms of government intervention in the economy than both
the current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker would
be Richard Gephardt.  After flirting with the many "New Democratic" political
themes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade
to espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,
and other forms of government intervention in the economy.<p>
<p>
As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in the
congressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victory
in this November's congressional races would probably have three immediate
effects on the economy.<p>
<p>
It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar.<p>
<p>
It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico as
well as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable to
congressional demands for more restrictive trade polices.<p>
<p>
It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about new
investment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election would
affect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor market
regulation.  Ironically, such caution might cause bond yields to fall during
early 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 the
weakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economic
slowdown.<p>
