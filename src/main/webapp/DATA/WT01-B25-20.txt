<h1>A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG PROHIBITION </h1>

<p><b>by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York</b> </p>

<p>June, 1994 </p>

<hr>

<p>The June 1994 issue of &quot;The Record,&quot; the official
publication of the Association of the Bar of the City of New
York, will include a recently released report by the
Association's Special Committee on Drugs and the Law. The report
is entitled &quot;A Wiser Course: Ending Drug Prohibition&quot;
(the &quot;Report&quot;). In typewritten form, the Report is 83
pages long and has 203 footnotes of sources and authorities. </p>

<p>On June 15, 1994, the New York Law Journal (the daily
newspaper for lawyers in New York) printed on page one a news
article about the Report. Unfortunately, the rest of the
&quot;media&quot; (e.g., the New York Times, The Daily News,
Newsday, ABC, CBS, NBC, C-SPAN, TBS) have failed, at least so
far, to take any notice of this Report. </p>

<p>To get the word out about this Report, the Association has
given permission for the Report to be distributed on the
Internet. A full-length copy of the Report (about 96,388 bytes
but without the 203 footnotes) is posted here for your reading

<h1>A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG PROHIBITION </h1>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p>In 1986, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
responding to a general perception that criminal and civil </p>

<p>sanctions against the manufacture, distribution, or possession
of drugs were not &quot;solving,&quot; or even ameliorating, the
problems associated with drug use in our society, formed a
Special Committee on Drugs and the Law (the
&quot;Committee&quot;) to study our current drug laws and to
report its recommendations on the wisdom of such laws. </p>

<p>The Committee has considered the complex legal, social,
medical, economic, and political issues raised by our nation's
current drug control policies. Despite billions of dollars spent
on law enforcement, criminal prosecution, and incarceration
during the past 80 years, the United States has made little or no
progress toward reducing drug use or solving its &quot;drug
problem.&quot; On the contrary, illegal drug use remains a
pervasive and powerful influence in our cities and in the nation
at large. Beyond the continuing availability and consumption of
drugs, the unintended consequences of our current prohibition
policy are ubiquitous: our courts, both state and federal, are
jammed; our prison populations are burgeoning; urban and ghetto
children, as well as adults, are frequent victims of violent
&quot;turf wars&quot;; our civil liberties are being eroded,
along with our society's respect for the rule of law generally;
our public health is threatened; the enjoyment of urban life has
declined; and our nation's institutions, as well as those of our
South and Central American neighbors, are undermined by the
immense wealth accumulated illegally under the current
prohibition policies. </p>

<p>The Committee has concluded, in some cases reluctantly, that
the costs of drug prohibition are simply too high and its
benefits too dubious. </p>

<p>The Committee recognizes that calling for an end to drug
prohibition cannot be either the end of our inquiry or the sum of
our recommendations. There are several difficult questions that
remain to be answered: What forms of governmental regulation, if
any, are appropriate instead of prohibition? To what degree, if
any, should private distribution of drugs be permitted? Is a
regulatory regime similar to one now used to control alcoholic
beverages appropriate for some, if not all, drugs? How should a
new regulatory regime treat children, adolescents, or pregnant
women? What kinds of prevention and treatment programs should
there be and how should they be funded? </p>

<p>These and other issues demand both the urgent attention and
honest judgment of our Committee and, more broadly, our society. </p>

<p>The Committee believes the necessary inquiry cannot begin in
earnest so long as our nation remains committed to the illusion
that drug use can be prohibited at an acceptable cost. Only by
recognizing that this is no longer true can we fashion a method
of controlling drugs other than the current coercive drug laws,
which have been largely ineffective and which are sapping the
vitality of our cities, our legal system, and our society as a
whole. It is the Committee's hope that this report will advance
the discussion of this important issue. </p>

<h2>II. THE COSTS OF PROHIBITION </h2>

<h3>A. DISTORTION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM </h3>

<p>At a time of ever-increasing competition for scarce public
funds, the volume of drug prosecutions and convictions continues
to increase, as does the strain on judicial budgets, personnel,
and facilities in the federal and state systems. The added
burdens on the judiciary due to drug prosecutions have
substantially diminished the courts' capacity to manage the civil
docket. Criminal cases take priority, with civil jury trials
relegated to the bottom of an increasing waiting list. Some
courts, for purely budgetary reasons, have been forced to suspend
all civil jury trials for periods of time. </p>

<h4>1. New York State </h4>

<p>The majority of drug cases are handled by state and local
courts. Consequently, it is instructive to review first the
impact of these increased caseloads and costs on New York State. </p>

<p>In 1991, New York State spent a total of $8,641,418,000 for
all judicial and legal services (including police protection,
$3,662,389,000; courts, $932,314,000; prosecution and legal
services, $461,790,000; and public defense, 197,194,000). It is
difficult to obtain specific dollar figures for the cost of drug
arrests and prosecutions in New York State, but by combining the
available data on caseloads and judicial costs it is possible to
make some rough estimates. In 1987, total arrests in New York
State were 481,676, whereas in 1991 the total was 506,710, an
increase of 5.2%. During the same period, felony drug arrests
rose from 42,655 (approximately 9% of total arrests) in 1987 to
54,184 in 1991 (11% of all arrests), a 27% increase. By contrast,
between 1987 and 1991, misdemeanor drug arrests dropped from
53,621 to 36,489, a decrease of 32%. In 1991 a tremendous volume
of caseload activity confronted the Judiciary's judges and
nonjudicial personnel. Nearly 79,000 felony indictments and
superior court informations were filed in Supreme and County
Courts throughout New York. That number represents a 54% increase
compared with 1985. Most of the statewide increase was the result
of phenomenal caseload increases in New York City. This year, the
Supreme Court Criminal Term in New York City received over 52,000
felony filings, an astonishing 70% increase since 1985. The
remarkable level in felony filings is primarily caused by
increases in drug-related filings. </p>

<p>. . . Unquestionably, these caseload increases are the product
of the drug crisis which, perhaps for the first time in our
State's history, threatens to test our ability to administer
justice on the local level, not just in New York City, but
statewide. </p>

<p>The increasing number of drug prosecutions in New York's
courts has taken its toll on the judicial system. One New York
State Supreme Court Justice has summarized the impact of the
so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot; on New York's criminal justice
system as follows: </p>

<p>Our court calendars groan under the burden of ever-increasing
new drug cases. New York City's Corrections Department estimates
that 70 percent of its inmates are charged with drug-related
crimes. Yet these ever-growing prosecutions and incarcerations
are having little or no impact on drug crimes. In 1980 only 11
percent of the total inmate population was incarcerated for drug
offenses, yet by 1992 this figure rose to 44 percent. At a cost
of $30,000 per year to maintain each prisoner, our state spent
over $195 million in 1992 to confine drug offenders alone. Last
year the state's Office of Court Administration requested an
additional $40 million just to cover the expense of drug cases.
Since the advent of crack a decade ago, the city has hired 9,000
new police, 700 additional assistant district attorneys, and has
added 18,000 new cells on Rikers Island. The total cost: $591
million a year. </p>

<h4>2. Other States </h4>

<p>State court convictions for drug law violations have increased
dramatically nationwide since the mid-1980s. Between 1986 and
1988, there was a nearly 70% increase in the number of persons
convicted of felony drug trafficking or possession charges (from
135,000 to 225,000). The number of persons convicted who received
state prison sentences rose from 49,900 to 92,500. In 1988, drug
offenses accounted for approximately one-third of all felony
convictions in all state courts. </p>

<h4>3. Federal Courts </h4>

<p>The case loads and concomitant costs of managing drug cases in
federal courts also have increased substantially over the past
decade. In 1982, the budget for prosecution of all federal drug
cases in the United States was $78.9 million; in 1993, the budget
was ten times as much -- $795.9 million. In federal district
courts in 1989, a total of 54,643 criminal cases were prosecuted;
of those 16,834 (approximately 30%) were for drug offenses. In
1990, 19,271 defendants were prosecuted for drug offenses; of
those 3,083 were not convicted, and 16,188 were convicted: 13,036
by guilty plea (81%), and 3,121 after trial (19%). Between July
1992 and June 1993, 50,366 defendants were convicted in the
federal courts, and 27% of these (18,576) were convicted of
federal drug offenses. Expenses associated with appeals of
federal drug cases rose from $8.2 million in 1982 to $104.2
million budgeted in 1993. A significant portion of this increase
resulted from appeals filings in drug-related cases, which
totalled 1,583 in 1981, 4,386 in 1989, and 5,658 in 1990 (a 29%
increase from the previous year alone and, overall, a 383%
increase in ten years). In 1991, there were 5,570 federal
drug-related appeals filed. </p>

<h4>4. The Judiciary is Impatient with the Present System </h4>

<p>Federal and state judges throughout the United States have
publicly expressed frustration with the present laws prohibiting
drugs, and some senior federal judges have even refused to sit on
drug cases. In the Southern District of New York and in the
Eastern District of New York, Judges Whitman Knapp, Robert Sweet,
and Jack Weinstein have spoken out publicly against the present
laws and their associated draconian penalties, and Judges Knapp
and Weinstein have refused, as is their right as senior judges,
to preside over drug trials and sentences. State judges in New
York have also protested the increasing time on their calendars
that drug cases take and the Second Offender sentencing rule that
compels them to give lengthy prison sentences to second-time drug
offenders. These judges seek a solution to the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; before the whole judicial system breaks down under
the strain. </p>

<h4>5. Efforts to Handle Court Congestion </h4>

<p>Because of the enormous increase in drug cases, especially in
large urban areas, several stop-gap solutions are being pursued
to balance limited court resources against the burgeoning
caseloads. In New York City and New Orleans, for instance,
special narcotics divisions have been established to expedite
processing of drug felonies. These experimental programs are
designed to hear cases just prior to grand jury proceedings with
the goal of inducing defendants to accept plea bargains that are
better than would be expected if the case proceeded through the
grand jury process. Also, special court parts -- staffed by
personnel with expertise in drug cases, addiction, and community
treatment centers -- have been established in New York City to
deal exclusively with drug cases. Unfortunately, none of these
short-term solutions will correct the fundamental distortion of
the priorities of the state and federal judicial systems caused
by the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; </p>

<h3>B. THE PRISON STATE </h3>

<p>One of the most tangible, measurable effects of the &quot;war
on drugs,&quot; has been the creation of a &quot;prison
state&quot;. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
statistics, one million arrests are made annually for violations
of the federal and state drug laws. As a result of these massive
numbers of arrests each year, &quot;the United States has a
higher proportion of its population incarcerated than any other
country in the world for which reliable statistics are
available.&quot; </p>

<p>Incarceration in America is now at an all-time high. From 1925
through 1973, the American prison population fluctuated between
90 and 120 people in prison per 100,000 of the population; in
1973 the rate was 98 per 100,000, a ten-year low. </p>

<p>Between 1973 and 1980, however, there was a 40% increase, to
135 people in prison per 100,000; and by 1986, following the
start of the modern &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the incarceration
rate had jumped to 200 per 100,000. In 1993, the rate of
Americans serving prison time stood at 325 per 100,000. In 1993,
the number of inmates in federal and state prisons in New York
increased by 4.6%, to 64,600. </p>

<p>On average, it costs $20,000 per year to maintain one
prisoner, $100,000 to build a single prison cell, and $20,000 per
year to staff a prison cell. </p>

<p>More than one in forty American males between the ages 14 and
34 are locked up. </p>

<p>Between 1980 and 1990, the total prison population in the
United States increased by 133% to over 771,000 prisoners. </p>

<p>In 1993, the total prison population reached 949,000, nearly
three times as many as in 1980. During the 1980s, new
imprisonments on drug charges increased over 1,000%. </p>

<p>Drug offenders have accounted for an increasing percentage of
the population in State and Federal correctional facilities. </p>

<p>Drug offenders constituted an estimated 22% of the State
prison population in 1991, up from 6% of the population in 1979.
In Federal correctional facilities, drug offenders accounted for
61% of the population, up from 16% in 1970, 25% in 1980, and 52%
in 1990. </p>

<p>The vast majority of the prison population increase during the
1980s, which doubled the number of persons under custody for all
charges, involved drug law violations. Due to the great increase
in drug-related incarcerations, the federal and state prison
systems are overwhelmed, as reported almost daily in the
newspapers. Prison overcrowding persists despite an unprecedented
boom in prison construction. For example, between 1983 and 1992,
New York State built 29 prisons, increasing the number of prisons
in the state to 68 and the inmate capacity from 29,253 to 57,862.
</p>

<p>No one wants overcrowding. It riles inmates, strains prison
guards, encourages the spread of illness and generally makes
prisons more volatile places. In the past, when there was money
to spend, the solution to overcrowding would have been clear --
create more space. Not any more. With money scarce and a sense
that more prison beds have not resulted in less crime, many
lawmakers are being forced to conclude they can no longer build
their way out of the problem. </p>

<p>According to the United States Department of Justice,
&quot;drug offenders&quot; are becoming a larger share of the
prison population for two reasons: first, the likelihood that a
conviction will result in incarceration is increasing; and
second, those convicted on drug charges are receiving longer
prison sentences. </p>

<p>Mandatory sentencing laws, such as the federal sentencing
guidelines, exacerbate the problem by forcing judges to impose
lengthy sentences for simple possession of small amounts of
drugs. These laws, first passed in the 1970s but increasingly
relied on as a weapon in the &quot;drug war&quot; in recent
years, have in large measure been responsible for today's severe
overcrowding. Mandatory minimum sentences require judges to
impose a statutorily-defined minimum period of incarceration
without the possibility of parole, with no consideration of the
specific facts of the crime or any mitigating circumstances.
Faced with mandatory sentences laws, there has been at a growing
movement at the state level to minimize their draconian effects.
In New York, for example, the courts had been cooperating with
prosecutors and defense attorneys to avoid the harsh effects on
second-time drug offenders. New York's Governor, Mario Cuomo, in
his 1994 budget message has asked the Legislature to restore
discretion to judges meting out second-time drug felony sentences
&quot;to relieve overcrowding in state prisons.&quot; </p>

<p>For all of the extra burden on the prison and judicial systems
and on the taxpayer caused by the &quot;war on drugs,&quot;
American society has little to show for it. &quot;If such
toughness had much to do with crime, you'd think we'd have seen
some results by now. But . . . overall crime has decreased only
6% since 1973; violent crimes are up 24%. The National Research
Council of the National Academy of Sciences recently concluded
that a tripling of time served by violent offenders since 1975
had `apparently very little' impact on violent crime.&quot; With
61% of today's federal inmates incarcerated on drug law
convictions, judiciary and corrections overcrowding and escalated
costs would necessarily be reduced were the current drug policy
altered toward a less punitive, more humane approach which
removes the profit motive fueling the black market in illegal
drugs. </p>

<h3>C. EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL LIBERTIES </h3>

<p>One of the more insidious effects of the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; has been the gradual erosion of the rule of law and
the public's civil liberties. Several interrelated elements
contribute to this particularly destructive consequence of the
current drug laws. </p>

<h4>1. Perception of Ineffectiveness </h4>

<p>Politicians from the President of the United States to mayors
running in local elections are importuned by the people for the
assurance that increasing crime and the criminal element be
contained in our society. Our country, with the highest rate of
drug abuse of any industrial country in the world, also has the
largest budget in the world to enforce its laws prohibiting
drugs. Despite huge increases in the federal government's budget
for the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; the so-called &quot;drug
problem&quot; with all of its ramifications, has not
significantly abated. The public's perception of its political
leaders' ineffectiveness in alleviating drug-related violence
adds to the general atmosphere of lawlessness and breeds cynicism
and disrespect for the law. Instead of progress since the first
federal anti-drug law was passed in 1914, nearly 80 years of drug
prohibition have yielded few inroads against the sale or use of
drugs. This, understandably, suggests to the public that the law
itself is an ineffectual tool for dealing with the issue. </p>

<h4>2. Perception of a Self-Perpetuating System </h4>

<p>The large sums of money appropriated for law-enforcement
create enormous, self-perpetuating bureaucratic agencies, such as
the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (&quot;DEA&quot;),
which fight for independence and scarce public resources while
making little headway against the &quot;drug problem.&quot; These
agencies have ample motivation to exaggerate or distort the
extent and danger of &quot;drug abuse&quot; so as to justify (and
thereby insure) their continued existence. Being inherently
biased, they have great potential to ignore the public's true
welfare. </p>

<h4>3. Police Corruption </h4>

<p>The fact that drug prohibition breeds corruption has been
known for decades. Every day there are news stories of law
enforcement officers being arrested for their involvement with
drug dealers. The sums of money involved in the drug business are
too great and too inviting for the law enforcers not to seek
their share. Corrupt police behavior creates a further
disillusioned public. In addition, just as organized crime became
entrenched during Prohibition, the current prohibitionist regime
is currently subsidizing the mafia and other organized crime
groups because of the highly inflated prices on the black market.
</p>

<h4>4. Poor Children are Victims of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; </h4>

<p>There is no reason to believe that recognized market forces
cease to apply where the drug business is concerned. There is
public recognition that youths and unemployed adults often cannot
just say &quot;no&quot; to drugs when saying &quot;yes&quot; as a
dealer or a dealer's helper is much more profitable than are the
alternatives. Children living in poor, urban neighborhoods are
particularly susceptible to being drawn into illegal drug-related
activities by visions of status and easy money. Laws against
drugs thus discourage many youths and adults from productive
legitimate employment that would benefit society. </p>

<h4>5. Selective Prosecution </h4>

<p>Criminal prosecutions for violations of the federal and state
drug laws appear to be disproportionately directed against
minorities. Understandably, there is widespread public concern
that the drug laws are selectively enforced with vigor against
the poor and disenfranchised, while rich and middle class drug
users are permitted to indulge without serious fear of legal
consequences. </p>

<h4>6. Erosion of Constitutional Rights </h4>

<p>The pursuit of a &quot;drug-free&quot; society has resulted in
a panoply of intrusions into the lives of United States citizens:
The Bill of Rights is in danger of becoming meaningless in cases
involving drugs. Tenants charged with no crime are evicted from
homes where police believe drugs are being sold. Public housing
projects are sealed for house-to-house inspections. The Supreme
Court has permitted warrantless searches of automobiles, the use
of anonymous tips and drug-courier profiles as the basis for
police searches, and the seizure of lawyers' fees in drug cases.
Property on which marijuana plants are found can be forfeited
even if the owner is charged with no crime. Prosecutors have been
allowed to try the same person at the state and federal levels
for the same drug-related crime. </p>

<p>A few examples will illustrate the erosion in individual civil
liberties occasioned by the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; In 1991,
the United States Supreme Court in Florida v. Bostick, upheld the
constitutionality of a police tactic of boarding long- distance
buses and asking permission to search passengers' baggage,
overruling the Florida Supreme Court's ruling that such an
encounter with the police is so inherently coercive that no
consent given for such a search could be truly voluntary. The
Florida v. Bostick decision was merely one of a number of rulings
since the early 1980s which authorized police stops and
questioning of airline, train, and bus passengers without the
level of suspicion generally required for Fourth Amendment search
and seizure purposes. </p>

<p>The search for tell-tale evidence of drug use has even
descended to the level of compelling federal employees to give
urine samples for analysis, without regard to whether such a
privacy intrusion is related to job performance. The public --
led by the government -- appears to be willing to jump on the
bandwagon &quot;to restrict civil liberties, and even accept
warrantless searches of homes and cars, in order to reduce the
use of illicit drugs.&quot; </p>

<h4>7. Forfeiture's Heavy Hand </h4>

<p>Forfeiture has become one of the most publicized and
controversial weapons in the government's anti-drug arsenal. Any
assumption, however, that the law would be deployed only against
&quot;drug kingpins&quot; and major players has proved
unwarranted as small time dealers and marginal users are more
often targeted: Under Zero Tolerance, which targets casual drug
users, the government has seized thousands of cars, boats, and
homes because occupants or guests allegedly carried drugs. In
1990, seizures exceeded $527 million, and they are expected to
exceed $700 million in 1991. The U.S. Marshalls Services now has
a $1.4 billion inventory of seized assets including more than
30,000 homes, cars, businesses and other property. </p>

<p>In the fiscal year 1993, &quot;the DEA made 14,430 domestic
seizures of nondrug property, valued at approximately $669
million.&quot; Moreover, forfeitures have become a popular way to
generate additional revenue. </p>

<p>The in rem nature of a civil forfeiture proceeding, replete
with its many procedural pitfalls, rests on the legal fiction
that the property itself is guilty of wrongdoing. The uneven
burdens of proof assigned the parties reveals the imbalance in
the system. To prevail, the government need only have reasonable
grounds to believe the property is subject to forfeiture. It
falls to the claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the negative proposition that the property was
&quot;innocent.&quot; As a result of the over-zealous application
of the forfeiture statutes, the judiciary has attempted to curb
some of the more visible excesses. For instance, absent exigent
circumstances, pre-hearing seizures of homes, where the tenants
were either evicted outright or were permitted to stay at the
sufferance of the United States Marshall, are no longer
tolerated. And the forfeiture of real property is now expressly
subject to the limitations of Eighth Amendment proportionality
analysis. </p>

<p>A claimant's ability to defend against a forfeiture has long
been compromised by the maze of rules allowing for the freezing
of assets, which alone often discourages private counsel from
taking on a case. Too often, the failure to secure experienced
counsel results in the loss of the property. Finally, with news
accounts of law enforcement personnel driving around in expensive
cars seized during drug operations, reports of police helicopters
with sophisticated detection equipment hovering over homes, and
the intrusive subpoenaing of records from bona fide businesses
(such as those offering hydroponic gardening equipment), it is
clear that forfeiture laws require an overhaul. </p>

<h4>8. Erosion of Privacy Rights </h4>

<p>Although the Ninth Amendment guarantees that &quot;[t]he
enumeration in the Constitution of rights shall not be construed
to deny or disparage others retained by the people,&quot; our
society has struggled to find a balance between individual
liberty and privacy and governmental intrusion. Although the
United States Supreme Court has recognized certain activities as
being beyond the reach of most state or federal governmental
intrusion (e.g., birth control, abortion during the first
trimester, and the possession of adult pornography in the home),
drug use has never been found to be within the &quot;right of
privacy&quot; that the Court has forged. Because the law, as it
stands today, does not recognize the right to use drugs, the
&quot;war on drugs&quot; has become &quot;in effect, if not in
intention, a war on drug users.&quot; Year after year, state and
federal laws that prohibit the possession of drugs, demonize and
criminalize the users of drugs, estimated to be at least 20
million in the United States alone. Yet, &quot;[d]rugs have been
used to alter consciousness in most societies throughout history,
and different drugs have been considered acceptable at different
times and places.&quot; As Lester Grinspoon and James B. Bakalar
have stated: </p>

<p>Of all the Prohibition era mistakes we are now repeating, the
most serious is trying to free society of drugs by the use of
force. There is no reason to believe that the inclination to
ingest substances that alter consciousness can be eradicated. A
drug-free society is an impossible and probably an undesirable
dream. . . . Our present drug policies are immoral because they
require a war of annihilation against a wrongly chosen enemy. We
will never be able to regulate the use of consciousness-altering
drugs effectively until our ends are changed along with the means
that serve them. </p>

<p>Ending drug prohibition would enable the Court and our society
to recognize the right of individuals to alter their
consciousness (the most private of matters), so long as they do
not harm the persons or property of others. </p>

<h3>D. PROHIBITION-INDUCED VIOLENCE </h3>

<p>In New York and elsewhere in the United States, wild shootouts
in urban areas are frequently publicized. These reports reveal
that innocent bystanders in these areas are often caught in the
cross-fire. It is, however, far from clear that the use of or
need for prohibited drugs causes this sort of violent crime.
Rather, the available evidence tends to support the conclusion
that it is the prohibitionist laws against drugs that cause the
violent crimes that people generally deplore. </p>

<p>So-called &quot;drug-related crime&quot; is often related only
indirectly to the drugs themselves, resulting instead from the
illegal black market in drugs that is, in turn, spawned by laws
prohibiting the legal sale of drugs. For example, the Los Angeles
police have long known that the lucrative black market in cocaine
has provided the incentive (as well as the financing) for the
bloody gang turf wars in that city. Similarly, it is estimated
that 40% of the homicides in a study of 414 homicides in New York
City precincts were indirectly attributable to black market
trafficking in drugs. Further supporting the fact that it is drug
prohibition rather than drug use which is causing the alarming
&quot;drug-related&quot; violence saturating our culture is the
historical precedent of alcohol Prohibition which was accompanied
by the same type of violence. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that black markets would not
disappear with the ending of drug prohibition. Common sense
indicates that without the immense profits guaranteed by the
necessarily restricted nature of the outlets, there would be
little advantage to maintaining such black markets. The current
patterns of drug-sale related turf violence would be
substantially, if not wholly, undermined. </p>

<h3>E. PROHIBITION'S FAILURE TO LIMIT DRUG USE </h3>

<p>Proponents of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; often eagerly
declare that the draconian prohibitionist laws of the state and
federal government are causing a decline in drug use. The
evidence, however, tends to show that &quot;the number of heavy
drug users in the United States is undiminished.&quot; In
addition, recent surveys show an increasing number of high school
students using marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide
(&quot;LSD&quot;). Even proponents of the &quot;war on
drugs&quot; candidly admit that &quot;drug abuse cannot be
entirely eliminated.&quot; Some experts have estimated that the
government has spent close to $500 billion dollars over the past
20 years to enforce the prohibitionist laws against drugs, while
during the same period use levels rose and the number of arrests
and the amounts of drugs seized increased unabated annually.
750,000 people were incarcerated for violating the prohibitionist
drug laws during a twenty-year period, costing an average of $25
billion annually and $61 billion for 1991 alone. </p>

<p>Although the vast majority of Americans polled stated that
they would not take now-prohibited drugs if they were legalized,
many people voice the concern that use would escalate sharply
upon legalization. Implicit in the idea that use of drugs would
rise upon legalization is the assumption that the current
prohibitionist laws discourage many people from using them. The
available evidence tends to show that Americans can and do
voluntarily control their use of drugs. </p>

<p>The recent decline in middle class use of drugs as well as
recent declines in alcohol and tobacco consumption have been
attributed by many experts to factors (such as education, health
and fitness awareness, and social pressures) other than the
prohibitionist laws against drugs. Experts have recognized these
other factors as the basis for the current levels of use of drugs
(including alcohol and tobacco) rather than the existence of
prohibitionist laws. Indeed some observers have cited the
prohibitionist laws against drugs as a significant factor leading
to increased use and greater numbers of addicts than we would
otherwise have: [T]he growth of addiction over the last four
decades in the US had little to do with price reductions or, for
that matter, with the growth of real income. The crucial factor
in the spread of the drug habit has been the unrelenting pressure
exerted by legions of street pushers in the continuing endeavor
to widen the circle of the customers. In other words, the crucial
factor in spreading the drug habit has been the super profits
made possible only by governments' illegalization of the
trade.&quot; </p>

<p>It is impossible to prove the levels of post- legalization use
of now-prohibited drugs, but reasonable extrapolations may be
made by referring to similar experiences in this country and
abroad. </p>

<p>Prohibition of alcohol in the United States earlier in this
century is a basis for comparison, albeit an imperfect one. A
review of alcohol consumption patterns during and after
Prohibition shows that during most of the Prohibition era per
capita alcohol consumption actually increased. After
&quot;Prohibition's repeal in 1933, consumption remained fairly
stable until after the Second World War when, without any change
in public policy, it began increasing.&quot; The prohibitionist
laws, therefore, seem to have little impact on an individual's
decision whether to use drugs. Another useful example is the
experience of the ten states that decriminalized the possession
of small amounts of marijuana for personal consumption in the
1970s. There was no increase in the level of marijuana use in
those states. Indeed marijuana consumption declined in those
states just as it did in states that retained criminal sanctions
against marijuana. In 1976, the Dutch decriminalized marijuana
consumption, although possession and small sales technically
remained illegal. The level of use actually declined after
decriminalization. Indeed marijuana use in the Netherlands is
substantially lower than in countries waging a &quot;war on
drugs,&quot; including the United States and, at least until
recently, Germany. Among Dutch youths aged 17-18, only 17.7% used
marijuana at least once in their lifetimes, as opposed to 43.7%
of Americans. Only 4.6% of the Dutch had used marijuana at least
once in the past month, as opposed to 16.7% of the Americans. </p>

<p>While indicating clearly that prohibitionist laws do not
prevent the use of drugs, these statistics also tend to show that
legalizing now-prohibited drugs, at least marijuana, does not
inevitably cause an increase in use. Under an exception to the
British prohibitionist system, doctors may provide prohibited
drugs to addicts. Dr. John Marks of Liverpool commenced such a
program in 1982, and, to his astonishment, he noted that the
number of new addicts decreased in Liverpool while in a nearby
town operating under prohibition the rate of new addicts was
twelve-fold higher. Dr. Marks attributed the decline in the
number of new addicts to the fact that addicts received their
needed drugs from his program for pennies, thus there was no
longer any need for addicts to bring in new customers to raise
enough money to support their habits. Others addressing the issue
of whether the levels of use of now prohibited drugs would
escalate to overwhelming proportions after legalization (as many
prohibitionists have predicted) have likened possible patterns of
illegal drug use to patterns of alcohol use, with which we have a
solid familiarity. They point out that Western cultures have
handled alcohol consumption with tolerable skill for centuries
and point out that most of the American population that drinks
occasionally, or even every day, exercises moderation. </p>

<p>Indeed the available data indicate that the vast majority of
the American population that uses now-prohibited drugs does so
with moderation. According to United States government
statistics, more than 75 million persons in the United States
household population have used prohibited drugs. The National
Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that close to 40 million
Americans continue to consume these substances. Yet, only a
comparatively minuscule number of deaths due to drug overdoses,
4,242, occurred in 1991 according to medical examiner data
compiled by the Drug Abuse Warning Network. Once the distinction
between use of prohibited drugs and abuse is acknowledged, the
available statistics show that the vast majority of Americans who
use drugs do not abuse them. </p>

<p>Based on our experience with American states' and foreign
decriminalization of marijuana, it appears that decriminalization
does not lead to greater levels of use nor to abuse. Likewise
there is evidence to support the proposition that the
decriminalization of the so-called &quot;hard drugs&quot; does
not lead to increased rates of addiction. Perhaps most
importantly, data analysis strongly indicates that social factors
wholly apart from the criminalization of drugs account in the
greatest measure for reduced rates of use. Based on the evidence,
it would not be unfair to say that the predicted,
post-legalization explosion in the use of drugs has been greatly
overstated and that use in continued moderation would be the much
more likely result. European countries, such as the Netherlands,
have benefitted from an approach to drugs that focuses on
&quot;harm reduction&quot; rather than draconian measures to
enforce prohibition. </p>

<h3>F. PROHIBITION THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH </h3>

<h4>1. Spread of Disease </h4>

<h5>a. Sharing Needles </h5>

<p>Because the possession of hypodermic needles is generally
illegal, users of injectable drugs routinely share needles and
syringes with one another, often in &quot;shooting
galleries&quot; where dozens of addicts may line up to use a
single needle rented out by the dealers and not sterilized
between uses. This sharing of needles has become a major source
of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (&quot;AIDS&quot;) and hepatitis. According
to a recent national review, &quot;more than 33% of new AIDS
cases occur among injecting drug users or people having sexual
contact with them.&quot; In New York State, the majority of new
AIDS cases since 1988 have been reported among users of
injectable drugs and their sexual partners. Both the Centers for
Disease Control and the New York State Department of Health have
estimated that more than 75% of pediatric AIDS cases are children
whose mothers either injected drugs or were the sexual partners
of persons who injected drugs. The data suggest, at the very
least, that sterile hypodermic needles should be readily and
freely available to drug users. So long as drug use remains
unlawful, however, free needle distribution is not likely to
attract a substantial portion of the user population. In
response, some courts have circumscribed laws dealing with the
unlawful possession of hypodermic needles by applying defenses of
medical necessity. </p>

<h5>b. Trading Sex for Drugs </h5>

<p>Because illicit drugs are expensive, many addicts turn to
prostitution to make money to support their habits, or exchange
sexual services directly for drugs. Prostitute drug addicts often
do not protect themselves from contracting sexually transmitted
diseases carried by their customers, and they pass such diseases
on to other customers, their lovers, and their children. The
crack epidemic, in particular, has been blamed for the recently
noted resurgence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted
diseases. </p>

<p>Dr. Robert Rolfs of the Centers for Disease Control placed the
blame squarely on cocaine and its high cost: People -- especially
women -- have high-risk sex and practice prostitution to support
their habits. And it is occurring in a relatively poor population
where people have a lot of things that prevent their access to
treatment. Therefore, they stay infected longer and are more
likely to pass their infections on to others. Fewer addicts would
be forced to resort to prostitution if the current prohibitions
against drugs were lifted. </p>

<h5>c. Neglect of Health </h5>

<p>Because of addicts' preoccupation with obtaining and using
drugs, and the debilitating effects of some of the drugs
themselves, many addicts are in very poor health. Malnutrition is
a frequent problem and, in turn, contributes to many others.
Addicts' poor health makes them especially susceptible to
diseases ranging from scurvy and shingles to tuberculosis and the
flu. Addicts are also more likely to contract communicable
diseases and therefore more likely to spread them. The
interrelated urban problems of homelessness and illegal drug
abuse have contributed to the development of multi-drug-resistant
strains of diseases such as tuberculosis, which was once thought
to be on the verge of eradication. These more virulent diseases
know few geographical limitations and pose risks to the general
population. </p>

<h5>d. Avoidance of the Health-Care System </h5>

<p>Individuals who use illegal drugs often put off addressing
their health problems for fear of prosecution or other adverse
consequences (e.g., rebuffs by doctors, loss of job). This
reluctance to seek medical care is compounded by the fact that
many drug addicts have no private physicians and rely instead on
public hospitals or clinics for any care they might get.
Prohibition, therefore, has perverse results on health; drug
abusers tend to enter the health-care system only if and when
their need for care is acute, which is also when care is most
costly to deliver. If, for example, a woman avoids pre-natal
care, she may give birth to a baby with low birth weight and
other medical difficulties. If a drug abuser puts off seeking
treatment for illnesses and injuries, he or she may end up in the
emergency room and the intensive care ward. Mothers and pregnant
women face the additional and justifiable fear that any
detectable drug use may be reported as a possible indication of
child abuse or neglect. In many large city hospitals, the urine
of newborn babies is tested for prohibited drugs, and mothers
whose babies test positive for pre-natal exposure are reported to
the child abuse authorities. </p>

<p>Until recently, in New York City, such babies were routinely
kept from their mothers pending investigations that often lasted
many months, interfering with normal bonding and necessarily
adversely affecting the infant's development and relationship
with the parent. Moreover, these women have, in some
jurisdictions, been prosecuted for pre-partum distribution of
prohibited drugs. </p>

<p>In addition to the obvious costs to the individuals who become
infected with catastrophic illnesses directly through drug use,
and the high costs to the health care system of treating them,
prohibition contributes to the spread of such diseases throughout
society, particularly to the sexual partners and children of
infected drug users. Left untreated, users and addicts are more
likely to give birth to unhealthy children, to abuse or neglect
their children after they are born, or to have their children
placed in foster care. </p>

<h4>2. Lack of Information and Quality Control </h4>

<h5>a. Adulterated Drugs, Designer Drugs, and Drugs of Unknown
Potency </h5>

<p>Because drugs are manufactured and distributed in secret, it
is impossible for users to guard against adulteration or to
determine the purity and potency of the drugs they use. The
problem is compounded by drug growers, manufacturers, and
distributors who, to minimize the risks of apprehension, develop
and purvey the drug varieties that pack the most intoxicating
effect into the smallest package. According to an experienced New
York City researcher, The fact that cocaine, heroin and related
drugs are illegal encourages the use of injection. Severe
statutory restrictions greatly increase the cost of illicit
substances to nonmedical users. Injecting provides a way to
economize. Injectable forms of opiates and coca are much more
concentrated than traditional forms, such as opium or coca tea.
Injection provides an intense and economical effect by maximizing
the amount of drug that reaches the brain. People who sniff or
smoke drugs say that if they inject they need only one third of
the amount of the drug to maintain a habit. </p>

<p>Because the injection forms of illicit drugs are concentrated,
they are [also] relatively easier to ship. It has been
demonstrated that, as law enforcement and criminal penalties
intensify, dealers also find other ways to economize by inventing
new drugs -- so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot; -- that are not
yet prohibited. This places the ill-informed consumers of such
drugs at greater risk of overdose and other health problems.
Illnesses and deaths have resulted from (1) the introduction of
dangerous substances into drugs that could otherwise have been
used with greater safety, (2) inadvertent overdoses due to
variations in potency, and (3) the development of &quot;designer
drugs&quot; intended to give the effect of familiar intoxicants
with new chemical compositions that put them beyond the reach of
current laws. Just as the prohibition against alcohol led to
sales of poisonous wood alcohol and the prohibition against
abortion led to coat-hanger abortions, the prohibition against
drug manufacture, sale, and possession results in unnecessary
deaths due to adulteration, variable purity, and &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; This contrasts sharply with the government's current
regulation of alcoholic beverages, which ensures that the
beverages are pure and that buyers know how strong they are and
what some of their health effects may be. </p>

<p>Experts have noted that heightened efforts to enforce drug
laws and amend them to encompass new formulations or ban
precursor substances may only push dealers to take greater risks,
selling ever more potentially dangerous substances. </p>

<h5>b. Lack of Knowledge About Safer Use </h5>

<p>Because many drugs are outlawed, individuals considering drug
use rarely have access to accurate information about the effects
of drugs. While a cautious user may err on the side of avoiding
certain activities while under the use of drugs, he or she may
have no way of knowing, beyond trial and error, the possible
adverse health consequences of certain combinations of drugs and
his or her individual tolerance for particular substances.
Because of its penchant for exaggeration and cartoonish treatment
of the issues, most current education about drugs is not taken
seriously by young people. As a result, it is far less effective
than other health education (e.g., about nutrition, fitness, and
smoking cigarettes). </p>

<h5>c. Using Alcohol and Tobacco Instead of &quot;Soft
Drugs&quot; </h5>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco are completely legal yet do much more
harm, statistically speaking, than illegal drug use. It is also
generally recognized that alcohol, at least when used to excess,
can cause aggressive, anti-social behavior. The current
prohibitionist laws against marijuana, generally considered an
&quot;a-motivational&quot; drug, and other so-called &quot;soft
drugs&quot; have the effect of influencing some people to choose
alcohol over these &quot;soft drugs.&quot; Peter Reuter, an
economist at the Rand Corporation, concludes that &quot;If
marijuana is a substitute for alcohol . . . , alcohol is, by
definition, a substitute for marijuana. Thus tough marijuana
enforcement must increase drinking.&quot; Similarly, Frank
Chaloupka, an economist at the University of Illinois, found
through statistical analysis &quot;that states without criminal
sanctions against marijuana possession suffered fewer auto
fatalities.&quot; Finally, Karen Model, a Ph.D. candidate at
Harvard, found that &quot;states decriminalizing marijuana
reported lower overall rates of drug- and alcohol-related
emergencies.&quot; To the extent that users are choosing alcohol
rather than marijuana or other &quot;soft drugs,&quot; the
overall public health effects are probably worse than they would
be otherwise. </p>

<h4>3. Injuries Due to Violence </h4>

<p>The high prices commanded by prohibited drugs create
competition among groups and individuals willing to break the law
to supply drugs to consumers. Their competition often becomes
violent and has contributed to the build-up of arms and the
pervasiveness of violence in many areas. Gunshot wounds and other
traumas due to the illegal drug business have become commonplace
in big-city hospital emergency rooms. Not only traffickers, but
also law enforcement officers and innocent bystanders are often
the victims. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently noted: </p>

<p>The victims of the[] gun battles [of street-level drug
dealers] are innocent bystanders -- and often young children.
Last year alone, about 500 New York City children were shot; of
these, 89 were innocent bystanders hit by crossfire. The cost of
prohibiting drugs must be measured in terms of lost lives and
expensive medical care and include the hidden costs of lost
productivity and the psychological damage to individuals and
entire communities living in fear, helpless and hopeless. </p>

<p>With the possible exceptions of cocaine and PCP, drugs
themselves do not generally cause violent behavior. It is,
instead, turf wars for the control of black markets and the drug
users' need for money to purchase such substances that leads to
violence. Indeed, marijuana and heroin have been shown to render
their users disinclined to violence or incapable of violence
while under the influence. These substances are much less
dangerous in this regard than alcohol. </p>

<h4>4. Diversion of Resources from Treatment and Prevention </h4>

<p>Prohibition diverts money that could otherwise be used for
preventing and treating drug abuse. Federal anti-drug legislation
provides a single budget for &quot;supply reduction&quot; and
&quot;demand reduction&quot; efforts. Law enforcement agencies
have always received much more than prevention, treatment, and
research programs combined. The ABA recently reported that
&quot;[s]ince the early 1980s, treatment has been a declining
priority. In 1991, treatment received 14% of the $10.5 billion
federal drug budget compared to 25% ten years earlier.&quot;
During the same period, &quot;federal spending on law enforcement
increased 737%, with interdiction efforts leading the
increase.&quot; Ending drug prohibition would, by definition,
eliminate the need for any special law enforcement funds for drug
interdiction. It would also allow for the redirection of law
enforcement resources to concentrate on violent crime and quality
of life issues. </p>

<h4>5. The Sense of Treating Drugs as a Public Health Problem </h4>

<h5>a. Treatment Works </h5>

<p>The vast majority of resources in the United States available
to meet this country's &quot;drug problem&quot; have been
utilized for interdiction rather than education and treatment.
This allocation of resources has skewed the public's perception
of the problem, which is seen largely as one of law enforcement.
However, drug abuse and drug addiction are fundamentally a public
health problem. </p>

<p>Reallocation of resources away from interdiction and into
education and treatment is essential to the successful management
of this problem. Drug abuse and drug addiction are health
problems that can be treated. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, former
Deputy Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
now Medical Director of the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse and lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons, has identified a basic fallacy
responsible for the predominant pessimistic outlook: </p>

<p>Drug dependence has been viewed as a chronic relapsing illness
with an unfavorable prognosis. However, there are thousands of
formerly dependent individuals in the United States and elsewhere
who have remained off both illicit drugs and excess use of licit
drugs like alcohol for decades, functioning as productive
citizens . . . . [T]here are already effective methods of
treatment if the right approach [and] the right person can be
brought together. </p>

<p>No one should conclude that treatment is not effective just
because drug abuse, like alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking,
often cannot be &quot;cured&quot; with a single treatment effort.
Most people who do conquer drug addiction succeed only after
multiple efforts and relapses. Because effective treatment
depends on finding the best method of helping a particular person
at a particular time, several attempts may be needed to discover
what will work. </p>

<h5>b. Self-Help Groups </h5>

<p>Some substance abusers manage their problem with the help of
Alcoholics Anonymous (&quot;AA&quot;), Narcotics Anonymous
(&quot;NA&quot;) or similar groups. These voluntary self-help
associations offer the structure of a program following
&quot;twelve steps&quot; to sobriety and the support of fellow
abusers in different stages of recovery. Since these groups
maintain members' confidentiality and do not keep records of
attendance at meetings, their success has not been measured
statistically; however, anecdotal evidence of their effectiveness
is strong. Additionally, many respected treatment programs rely
on methods developed by the self-help groups and prescribe
attendance at AA and NA meetings for their patients. </p>

<h5>c. Therapeutic Communities </h5>

<p>One of the best-known methods of professional treatment for
drug abuse is a highly structured, long-term residential
inpatient program known as a therapeutic community. The Committee
visited three therapeutic community facilities in New York City
-- programs operated by Daytop Village, Project Return and
Phoenix House. Patients in therapeutic communities generally
spend one to two years, sometimes more, living and working in the
facility. Through individual counseling and group therapy, the
patients address the causes and effects of their substance abuse
and other problems and attempt to rebuild their lives free of
drugs. Education, vocational training and work experience are
important components of the treatment, because therapeutic
community patients frequently lack necessary skills for making
their own way in society. Successful patients gradually re-enter
the outside world, first obtaining jobs and ultimately moving to
homes outside the program. While many patients drop out of these
challenging and restrictive programs, research has shown that
three-quarters of the patients who stay for the prescribed course
of treatment remained drug-free seven years later. One study
found that 56% of the individuals entering residential treatment
(including those who dropped out) no longer used heroin or
cocaine one year later. By the end of the study, more than 80% of
the patients no longer used any prohibited drug other than
marijuana. Another different national study that focused on
opiate addicts revealed that nearly three quarters (74%) of the
addicts who entered therapeutic communities were not using
opiates regularly (i.e., on a daily basis) three years later. </p>

<h5>d. Other Inpatient Drug-Free Treatment Programs </h5>

<p>Substance abusers with health insurance or other means of
payment often seek residential treatment in less restrictive
settings and for shorter periods of time. Two of the best-known
programs providing this sort of inpatient treatment are the Betty
Ford Center in Palm Springs, California, and the Hazelden program
in Minnesota. Patients usually participate in intensive
individual counseling, group therapy, and AA or NA meetings.
Patients most commonly stay for four weeks and are then
discharged to &quot;aftercare&quot; programs for continuing
outpatient treatment or are advised to seek AA or NA meetings in
the community. Many prominent citizens have testified publicly to
the efficacy and value of these sorts of treatment programs. </p>

<h5>e. Outpatient Methadone Maintenance Programs </h5>

<p>Methadone maintenance is the most widely used treatment for
narcotics addiction in the United States. Drs. Vincent P. Dole
and Marie Nyswander developed the treatment at Rockefeller
University in the early 1960s. Heroin addicts who are medicated
with an appropriate daily dose of methadone, a long-acting
synthetic opiate, lose the desire to use heroin but do not
experience either withdrawal symptoms or the euphoric or
impairing effects of narcotic use. Methadone patients can
function normally and perform successfully in the workplace in
jobs ranging from attorney to architect to bus driver. </p>

<p>In the early stages of treatment, methadone patients visit the
program daily to receive their doses. They are granted more
flexible schedules as they show progress in treatment by
remaining free of other drugs, maintaining steady employment, and
making progress in other areas. Methadone programs also provide
counseling and other health care and usually arrange for
vocational rehabilitation, education, and other services. </p>

<p>Successful methadone patients may remain in treatment for many
years, often at reduced doses; and some eventually leave
treatment entirely. </p>

<p>A high proportion of methadone patients stay in treatment
(more than two-thirds, by many reports), and more than 85% of
those remaining in treatment for a year never use heroin again. A
substantial proportion also stop using alcohol and other drugs.
The results of research assessing the effectiveness of methadone
maintenance have been strikingly consistent. One major study
found that, within a year of beginning treatment, 70% of those
who had entered methadone treatment were no longer using heroin.
After three years, use by patients who had remained with the
program for at least three months had declined by almost 85%.
Another study examining AIDS infection among injection drug users
found that methadone maintenance treatment effectively reduced
intravenous drug use by 71%. An earlier study had found that more
than three quarters of the patients who entered methadone
maintenance treatment were still not regularly using opiates
three years later. </p>

<h5>f. Outpatient Drug-Free Therapy </h5>

<p>Substance abusers who cannot commit themselves to inpatient
treatment and do not want methadone treatment (or would not
benefit from it because their primary drug of abuse is not
heroin) can participate in a variety of outpatient drug-free
therapies, including the full range of &quot;talk&quot;
therapies, supervised twelve-step programs, and programs that use
acupuncture to reduce the craving for drugs. Outpatient programs
often are recommended as follow-ups to short-term hospital-based
&quot;detoxification&quot; programs, which generally are
effective only for short-term crisis intervention purposes. </p>

<p>The Committee visited the Lincoln Hospital Substance Abuse
Division in New York City, which has been treating drug abuse
patients with acupuncture for more than 15 years. </p>

<p>Acupuncture treatment, which involves the insertion of five
needles in the outer ear while the patients sit quietly in a
common room for 30 to 45 minutes, is meant to control withdrawal
symptoms and the craving for drugs and to have a general calming
effect. At Lincoln Hospital it is used in combination with group
counseling on the Narcotics Anonymous model, as well as
urinalysis monitoring. Like methadone treatment, acupuncture
begins as a daily treatment, with successful patients
&quot;graduating&quot; to less frequent schedules. Outpatient
drug-free treatment programs, whether they employ acupuncture or
not, differ in the nature, length and frequency of treatment
sessions. </p>

<p>The usefulness of acupuncture treatment for substance abuse
has been demonstrated in several studies. Outpatient programs,
generally, have demonstrated a fair amount of success in treating
substance abusers. One national study found that nearly
three-quarters of the patients who entered outpatient drug-free
programs for opiate abuse were not using opiates regularly three
years later. A later study of similar scope revealed that, after
a year in treatment, 42% of the regular cocaine users who stayed
in outpatient drug-free treatment for at least three months had
stopped using cocaine completely. Over three to five years,
regular heroin use by patients who had received treatment for at
least three months fell by half, and fewer than 20% of the
patients who stayed in treatment for at least three months were
regular users of any prohibited drug except marijuana. </p>

<h4>6. Empirical Research on Effective Drug Treatment </h4>

<p>Virtually all studies conducted over the last 20 years show
that the most commonly practiced methods of treatment do work.
Treatment has been shown to reduce substance abuse and ameliorate
its consequences. The outcome of treatment has not been found to
differ significantly with the type of treatment received.
Methadone programs, inpatient residential programs, and
outpatient drug-free programs all show dramatic results. </p>

<h5>a. Studies Examining the Effects of Treatment on Substance
Use </h5>

<p>The most comprehensive study of the effectiveness of drug
treatment, the Treatment Outcomes Prospective Survey
(&quot;TOPS&quot;) funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(&quot;NIDA&quot;), strongly confirmed the efficacy of treatment
in reducing drug use. For up to five years after their treatment,
TOPS followed 10,000 substance abusers who had been admitted to
37 different treatment programs across the country. The programs
included residential and outpatient drug-free programs and
outpatient methadone maintenance programs. Heroin and cocaine use
declined significantly for patients in all treatment modalities.
After a year in treatment, heroin use by patients in methadone
maintenance programs declined by 70%, while 75% of outpatient
drug-free patients and 56% of residential treatment patients had
stopped using heroin or cocaine. By the end of the study, fewer
than 20% of the patients regularly used any illegal drug except
marijuana, and 40% to 50% of the patients abstained altogether. </p>

<p>Other studies have reached virtually identical conclusions. A
study sponsored by NIDA to address the risk of AIDS infection for
injection drug users found that methadone maintenance treatment
effectively reduced intravenous drug use by 71% among those who
remained in the program for one year. An earlier NIDA study based
on the Drug Abuse Report Program (&quot;DARP&quot;) tracked the
drug use of 44,000 opiate addicts admitted to treatment between
1969 and 1974. The study found that most patients stopped using
opiates daily and had not resumed daily use three years after
they were discharged from treatment. More than three quarters of
the patients who entered methadone maintenance treatment (76%)
and nearly three quarters of the patients who entered therapeutic
communities (74%) or outpatient drug-free programs (72%) were
still not using opiates regularly three years later. A recent
follow-up study of 405 of the original 44,000 addicts found that
74% were not using heroin regularly twelve years after their
treatment ended. </p>

<p>Researchers have uniformly concluded that the three most
common forms of treatment are effective despite &quot;the variety
of problems suffered by clients, their long histories of deviant
and debilitating lifestyles, and a lack of support in the
community&quot; that lead so many addicts not to complete
treatment programs at all. Researchers also agree that the longer
addicts remain in treatment, the better their chances of success.
National studies of the behavior of thousands of addicts have
shown that, while one-third of the patients who stay in treatment
for more than three months are still not using drugs a year
later, two-thirds of those who stay in treatment for a year or
more stay off drugs. </p>

<h5>b. Studies Examining the Effects of Drug </h5>

<p>Treatment on the Consequences of Drug Abuse </p>

<p>Researchers have studied the impact of drug treatment on many
of the health and social problems that drug abuse contributes to
-- the spread of AIDS and other diseases, premature death, crime,
unemployment, costly medical care -- as one way of assessing the
success of drug treatment. Their studies have shown that
treatment reduces these associated consequences of drug abuse.
Treatment prevents the transmission of HIV and other blood-borne
diseases that spread when addicts share needles or sell sex for
drugs. Two studies have shown that the rate of HIV infection
among heroin addicts in New York City not in treatment (46%-47%)
is twice the rate of infection among addicts in methadone
treatment programs (23%-27%), and a recent study found that none
of a group of methadone patients with ten or more years in
treatment tested positive for HIV. </p>

<p>Research has shown that treatment also prevents crime. The
TOPS survey found that, in the six months following treatment,
97% of the residential therapeutic community clients and 70% of
the outpatient clients who had admitted committing predatory
crimes in the year before they entered treatment engaged in no
criminal activity at all. Three to five years after treatment,
the proportion of addicts involved in predatory crimes had fallen
by one half to two-thirds. The DARP study found that arrest rates
fell by 74% after treatment, for all treatment modalities.
Research reveals that treatment helps recovering addicts work, as
well. Only 33% of the 44,000 patients in the DARP study worked in
the year before admission to treatment, but 57% were employed in
the year following their discharge. Two- thirds of therapeutic
community patients were gainfully employed after discharge. The
employment rate of clients tracked in the TOPS study also surged.
Three to five years after patients entered treatment, the
employment of patients admitted to residential programs had
doubled over pre-treatment levels, while the employment of
addicts receiving outpatient treatment rose by more than half. </p>

<p>The costs of medical treatment for all sorts of health
problems decline when addicts receive treatment. As noted earlier
in this report, addicts themselves suffer many costly illnesses
as a result of drug use, ranging from hepatitis, syphilis and
tuberculosis to shingles, malnutrition and psychiatric problems.
In 1989, general hospital stays in which drugs or alcohol were
identified as a major factor accounted for 1.9 million days of
hospitalization in New York State alone. Using a conservatively
estimated average cost of $500 a day, that amounts to $9.5
billion worth of medical care. </p>

<p>Successful drug treatment starts addicts on their way to
physical recovery and therefore reduces these medical costs.
Successful drug treatment also prevents the spread of diseases to
others, such as children born to addicted mothers, and stems the
cost of medical care for them, as well as the cost of foster care
for children whose addicted parents cannot care for them. Other
benefits of treatment flow from its effects on criminal behavior
and employment. Treated addicts are much more likely to be
employed and therefore to contribute to the public coffers rather
than receive welfare. They make more productive employees and are
less likely to have accidents at work. Treated addicts are far
less likely to commit crimes and therefore will save society the
cost of property loss and prosecuting criminal activity. One
study that calculated the cost of crime, poor employment
activity, and medical treatment attributable to drug addiction
found that the total of these costs was ten to twenty-five times
the cost of treating drug addiction, depending on the cost of the
treatment chosen. The cost of treating an addict in a long-term
residential drug-free program, for example, was found to amount
to only four percent of the cost to society of not treating the
addict. </p>

<p>A comparison of costs also shows that treatment is much more
cost-effective than incarceration. In New York City, residential
drug treatment costs approximately $17,000 a year per treatment
bed, and outpatient treatment costs only $2,300-$4,000 a year per
treatment slot; the annual operating cost of a prison bed is
about $40,000, and the cost of building new prison cells exceeds
$100,000 each. Diverting drug abusers from prison to treatment
therefore saves New York State or City half the operating costs
of incarceration. It also alleviates the need to build expensive
new prisons. If the proven effect of treatment on criminal
recidivism is included, the savings to the criminal justice
system in the future would be even more substantial. Treatment
works and is, in fact, a much more cost-effective way of dealing
with substance abuse than arresting drug offenders and locking
them in prison. Successfully treated drug addicts give up crime,
become productive and more healthy citizens, and ultimately make
fewer demands on the public for social and medical services
throughout their lives. Their cure also reduces the overall
demand for drugs. </p>

<h4>7. Education Works </h4>

<p>One way to reduce the demand for illegal drugs is to prevent
individuals at an early and impressionable age from initiating
drug use. Using the school system and community programs to
educate children about drug use and its destructive consequences
is an idea that would undoubtedly be supported by many segments
of society. Logic suggests that education programs should be
effective in diverting young people from experimenting with
drugs. </p>

<p>Mathea Falco, in her book The Making of a Drug Free America,
details both school-based and community-based educational
programs which have proven results in preventing drug, alcohol
and tobacco use. Education has been shown to be effective in
preventing and reducing drug as well as tobacco and alcohol use
among children and teenagers. Simply to advocate
&quot;education,&quot; however, may not be enough; the assumption
that &quot;education,&quot; and any type of education program,
will be effective may be erroneous. Studies of the effectiveness
of drug education and prevention strategies seem to suggest that
long- term programs geared towards examining the &quot;social
influences&quot; leading to drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are
more successful in diverting and reducing subsequent use of
drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. These successful educational
programs are generally coupled with community and home prevention
and education programs. In contrast, certain short-term education
programs, which lack the corresponding community programs, have
not proven effective in actually reducing drug use. </p>

<h5>a. Life Skills Training Program </h5>

<p>This 15 session curriculum, which is geared towards junior
high school students, is designed to teach students personal
coping skills so that they may be better able to make decisions
and feel more confident in social situations. Evaluations of this
program, which has been taught in 150 junior high schools in New
York and New Jersey for the past ten years, show that rates of
smoking and marijuana use are one-half to three-quarters lower
among students who have participated in this program than those
who have not. </p>

<h5>b. Students Taught Awareness and Resistance </h5>

<p>This program, taught to first-year high school students,
combines a thirteen session classroom curriculum with
coordinating community, media, and family programs in an effort
to teach resistance skills to teenagers and reinforce the social
desirability of not using drugs. The program is followed-up with
a five-session booster course the following school year. This
program, in a five-year follow-up study, has been proven
effective in reducing the rate of tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol
use by 20% to 40% and cocaine use by 50%. </p>

<h5>c. Project Healthy Choices </h5>

<p>This program, geared towards sixth and seventh graders,
integrates discussions about drugs and alcohol into the everyday
curriculum by training teachers to incorporate the discussion of
drugs and alcohol into their teaching of academic subjects. This
program is currently implemented in approximately one hundred New
York City schools. It is believed that this approach will
reinforce prevention messages as the students will hear this
discussion as part of their learning on a wide variety of
subjects. The long-range effectiveness of this approach has not
yet been determined. </p>

<h5>d. Student Assistance Program </h5>

<p>This program, which has been implemented in junior and senior
high schools in twenty states, offers counseling during the
school day on a voluntary, confidential basis. A study of the
Westchester County, New York school system where the program was
originally implemented showed a significant reduction in alcohol
and marijuana use. More significantly, studies showed that the
rates of drinking and drug use were 30% lower among students at
schools which implemented the SAP program. </p>

<h5>e. Smart Moves </h5>

<p>&quot;Smart Moves&quot; is a program operated out of Boys and
Girls Clubs in the inner-cities where children live in high crime
neighborhoods. By offering after-school prevention programs and
recreational, educational, and vocational activities, this
program attempts to teach children to recognize the pressures to
use drugs and how to develop the verbal and social skills to
resist these pressures. Again, studies have shown that this type
of program can reduce cocaine and crack use and improve school
behavior and parental involvement. </p>

<h5>f. Seattle Social Development Project </h5>

<p>This comprehensive program seeks to strengthen the bond
between children from high crime neighborhoods and their families
and schools. The program provides to parents techniques to
monitor their children better; teachers get better training to
maintain order and resolve conflicts; and children, as in the
other programs, are taught skills to resist peer pressure.
Interestingly, while the program has shown results in deterring
girls from alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, it has not shown
similar effectiveness with boys. </p>

<h5>g. Programs for Children of Addicts </h5>

<p>Finally, a number of cities are attempting to develop
prevention programs geared towards the children of drug addicts.
These programs attempt to teach parents communication and
parenting skills and provide children with support and social
skills. Two such programs are &quot;Strengthening Families,&quot;
which has been implemented in Salt Lake City, Detroit, and Selma,
Alabama, and the &quot;Safe Haven&quot; program in Detroit.
Evaluations of the &quot;Strengthening Families&quot; program
suggest it strengthens family and school relationships and
affects attitudes towards alcohol and tobacco use. </p>

<p>This provides a summary of the types of successful programs
already available in the communities. Their success depends upon
a school and community commitment to implementing comprehensive
programs geared towards preventing drug use by children. The
diversity of the structure of the programs illustrates the
complexity of the problem. In addition to reaching out to the
&quot;average&quot; school age youth and warning them about the
dangers of substance abuse, there are children in high-risk homes
and crime-ridden neighborhoods who need additional support
structures to resist the pressures of drug use. </p>

<h2>III. TOWARD A NEW DRUG POLICY </h2>

<p>Joycelyn Elders, the United States Surgeon General, has
suggested that a study be made of our current drug policies and
perhaps a new drug policy adopted. Despite the Administration's
rejection of her suggestion, public perception is that she may be
right. Our government tried to prohibit alcohol consumption and
found it did not work. As demonstrated in this report, drug
prohibition is also a failure that causes more harm than the drug
use it is purportedly intended to control. The obvious answer is
that we must take the necessary steps towards a new approach to
drug policy. </p>

<p>Several different alternatives to drug prohibition are being
discussed. Federal District Judge Whitman Knapp suggests that
Congress should repeal all federal laws banning drug sales or
possession and permit states to devise alternatives to
prohibition. This is the present approach to alcohol in the
United States since the repeal of the 18th Amendment and the
Volstead Act. Federal District Judge Jack Weinstein suggests
&quot;standing down&quot; and making fewer arrests, having fewer
prosecutions, and spending more money on treatment. M.A.R.
Kleiman of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard suggests
as a solution to the drug problem a &quot;grudging
toleration&quot; allowing for sale of certain drugs through
state-regulated stores, but the strategy would be to discourage
consumption. </p>

<p>These and other alternatives to drug prohibition should be
thoroughly considered so that our society may choose a new
approach that will avoid the widespread evils caused by the
current drug laws. Any alternative to drug prohibition should
allow continued criminal sanctions against conduct affecting
others (the most obvious example being operating a vehicle while
under the influence). </p>

<p>It is the Committee's belief that a new approach to drug
policy should leave state and local governments free to employ
the full panoply of coercive penal sanctions when drug use is
relevant to conduct affecting others. For instance, as mentioned
above, operating any vehicle while under the influence of drugs
is not tolerated and that should not change. Although in New
York, voluntary intoxication remains relevant to negate specific
intent, the Legislature may wish to restore individual liability
in this area and make any intoxication that is voluntary
irrelevant as to mitigation, on the theory that by this voluntary
act the actor will be held responsible for the consequences of
his conduct while under the influence. Such a sanction is hardly
unreasonable, nor would it strike anyone as being unfair,
especially if facilities to deal with cases of actual addiction
were readily available. </p>

<p>Finally, any alternative to drug prohibition should not
preclude state and local governments from addressing
&quot;quality of life&quot; issues. Government should not be
powerless to control persons who are obviously and publicly
intoxicated. Through enforcement of the existing laws dealing
with public behavior, or appropriate amendments to such laws to
include specific conduct, government intervention would have
greater effect and would be readily accepted as appropriate by
the overwhelming majority of the population. </p>

<h2>IV. CONCLUSION </h2>

<p>The Special Committee on Drugs and the Law has spent the
better part of a decade examining this country's &quot;drug
problem&quot; and the mechanisms utilized to manage it,
principally a federal and state system of criminal proscription. </p>

<p>In recent years, the criminal penalties for possession and
distribution of proscribed drugs have increased, with mandatory
sentences being imposed at both the state and federal levels. The
prison population in the United States has more than doubled in
the past ten years, largely as the result of these prohibitionist
laws. The scarce resources of the federal and state judiciary
have been increasingly devoted to drug cases. </p>

<p>Despite all of these efforts, the drug war rages on. The
Committee recognizes the urgent and compelling need to make
additional resources available for education and treatment. We
believe that even at increased levels, however, treatment and
education are not enough to control this country's drug problem.
The Committee opposes the present prohibitionist system and
recommends the opening of a public dialog regarding new
approaches to drug policy, including legalization and regulation.

<p>SEPARATE STATEMENT TO A REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON </p>

<p>DRUGS AND THE LAW ENTITLED &quot;A WISER COURSE: ENDING DRUG
PROHIBITION&quot; </p>

<p>We are in agreement with the Report insofar as it calls for
the opening of a public dialog regarding new approaches to drug
policy but disagree with its conclusion that drug prohibition
should be ended. Our disagreement is based upon our concern that
the legal sale of drugs would increase substantially the number
of persons who use and/or become addicted to drugs, causing harm
not only to themselves but to society. Such harm would, in our
view, outweigh the benefits of eliminating drug prohibition. </p>

<p>1. Legalizing Drugs Would Reduce Their Cost to the Public,
Thereby Increasing Demand, Use and Addiction </p>

<p>The theory of drug legalization is that it would take the
profit motive out of illegal drug dealing, eliminating the evils
of drug prohibition. In order to accomplish this result drugs
would have to be sold at prices lower than their present illicit
levels. Many commentators have reached the conclusion that lower
prices would increase the demand for drugs. In Searching For
Alternatives - Drug-Control Policy in the United States, Edited
and With Introduction by Melvyn B. Krauss and Edward P. Lazear,
Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, Stanford,
California (1991), the authors have compiled commentar- ies from
both proponents and opponents of drug legalization, most of whom
acknowledged that lessening cost and increasing access may create
higher drug use. See, e.g., id. at 22-25; 83; 107. </p>

<p>2. The Report Fails to Provide a Concrete Proposal </p>

<p>The Report states that &quot;The Committee opposes the present
prohibitionist system . . . .&quot; However the Report provides
no concrete proposal that would permit us to determine whether
any net benefit to society would result from legaliza- tion.
Should we endorse either (i) the legal sale of crack,
amphetamines, hallucinogens and similar dangerous drugs or (ii)
the sale of drugs to minors? Certainly, if we accept the propo-
sition advanced by many commentators that the legal sale of
drugs, at lower prices than the prices of illegal drugs, would
greatly widen demand, we should reject the proposal that such
harmful substances as those mentioned above be legally sold or
that any drugs be sold to minors. On the other hand, prohibition
of sale of those substances, or of drugs generally to minors,
would give illegal drug traffickers a continuing opportunity to
exploit these markets, and thus by definition the proposal would
not end the evils of drug prohibition. </p>

<p>The Report's failure to provide a specific proposal leaves
these critical issues unresolved. We agree with the Report's
statement that &quot;These and other alternatives [types of
legalization proposals] should be thoroughly considered so that
our society may choose a new approach that will avoid the wide-
spread evils caused by the current drug laws.&quot; A simple end
to drug prohibition, however, cannot be accepted as a solution to
these evils, because the &quot;solution&quot; would produce
greater social harm than the present system. </p>

<p>3. The Report Does Not Set Forth Any Convincing Basis for Its
Conclusion That &quot;Use in Continued Moderation&quot; Would Be
The &quot;Much More Likely Result of Decriminalization&quot; </p>

<p>The Report states that &quot;the available evidence does not
support [the] assumption&quot; that the current prohibitionist
laws discourage many people from using drugs, citing: rising
levels of drug use, arrests and seizures; recent declines in
alcohol and tobacco consumption; the role of drug pushers in
boosting demand; a description of Prohibition suggesting no
correlation between prohibition and use; the results of a 1970's
experiment in which 10 states decriminalized possession of small
amounts of marijuana; and a poll taken of the general public. The
Report also cites drug use trends in the Netherlands and England,
where the problems are less severe than in the United States.
Since neither the United States nor any other developed country
has legalized the sale of drugs, there is, of course, no
empirical evidence directly on point. None of the evidence cited
in the Report refutes the strong likelihood that reducing prices
and facilitating access would significantly increase demand for
drugs. </p>

<p>Recent reductions in use of tobacco and alcohol are not
reliable guidelines for legalized drugs because the pleasure-
enhancing and tolerance-producing (i.e., addictive) characteris-
tics of cocaine, crack and heroin are far more powerful than
those of tobacco and alcohol. See, id. at 18, 24, 78. The results
of Prohibition suggests a correlation between prohibition and
use. Alcohol use declined at the outset of Prohibition and then
increased to only 60% to 70% of pre- Prohibition levels.
Immediately after Repeal, alcohol use re- mained the same, but it
increased to pre-Prohibition levels during the next decade. See,
Miron, &quot;Drug Legalization and the Consumption of Drugs: An
Economist's Perspective&quot;, published in Searching For
Alternatives - Drug-Control Policy in the United States, at id.,
pages 74 to 75. </p>

<p>England and the Netherlands both prohibit drug traf- ficking
and have relaxed enforcement only at the level of the consumer or
patient. The experiences in those countries do not provide any
basis for predictions as to the impact of drug legalization in
the United States where there are far higher levels of both
supply and demand of illegal drugs. See id. at 172-188.
Similarly, the ten states where possession of small amounts of
marijuana was decriminalized are not reliable indica- tors
because trafficking and sale continued to be prohibited. </p>

<p>4. The Report is Mistaken in Characterizing Drug Abuse as an
Individual &quot;Right&quot; rather than as a Social Evil </p>

<p>The Report argues that &quot;Ending drug prohibition would
enable the Court and our society to recognize the right of indi-
viduals to alter their consciousness (the most private of mat-
ters) so long as they do not harm others.&quot; Consistent with
this approach, the Report notes that &quot;Any alternative to
drug prohibition shall allow the continued minimal control of
conduct affecting others (the most obvious example being
operating a vehicle while under the influence).&quot; </p>

<p>In characterizing drug abuse as a &quot;right of individu-
als&quot; the Report ignores its social costs, which include
physical damage to babies born of drug using mothers; abuse
and/or neglect by users of parents, offspring, friends and
relatives; death by overdose; teen suicides; homelessness;
drug-induced altered states of consciousness producing violence,
particularly from the use of cocaine and crack; loss of
productivity of drug-using workers; waste of educational
resources used in attempts to teach drug-abusing students; the
ripple effect on the economy from the presence of large numbers
of incapacitated or impaired individu- als; and the enormous cost
of drug treatment programs. See, Commentary by various authors in
Krauss and Lazear, supra, at pages 97-107; 202-206; 227-236. </p>

<p>5. The Report Should Stress the Need to Reduce Demand for
Drugs Without Endorsing Legalization </p>

<p>The Report is enormously thoughtful and comprehensive and
deserves the most serious study. It describes accurately and
completely the importance and effectiveness of harm reduction and
drug treatment programs. For the reasons stated above, however,
the Report should not recommend ending drug prohibition. Because
of the risk of catastrophic social harm from legalization, many
of the most thoughtful recent works on this topic do not recom-
mend this approach. Mathea Falco, in The Making of a Drug-Free
America (1992), cited in the Report, urges against a &quot;bigger
drug war&quot; (emphasis supplied) and that &quot;[w]e need an
entirely differ- ent approach&quot; . . . &quot;one that puts
into practice what we have learned in recent years about reducing
the demand for drugs.&quot; Id. at 191, 201. The author points
out that &quot;. . . law enforce- ment plays an important role,
but it should not be the center- piece of drug policy.&quot; Id.
at 199. In Reckoning Drugs, the Cities, and the American Future
(1993), Elliot Currie, while noting the same evils of drug
prohibition relied upon in the Report, states: </p>

<p>&quot;. . . no one seriously doubts that legalization would
indeed increase availability, and probably lower prices for many
drugs. In turn, increased availability, as we know from the
experience with alcohol, typically leads to increased
consumption, and with it increased social and public health
costs.&quot; </p>

<p>Id. at 187. In Addiction From Biology to Drug Policy (1994),
Dr. Avram Goldstein recommends retaining the present prohibition
on heroin, cocaine and the amphetamines while endorsing a variety
of harm reduction and drug treatment methods aimed at reducing
demand. Id. at 268-285. In Drug Use in America (1994), (Peter J.
Vesturelli, Editor) Prof. Patricia A. Adler recommends a
&quot;middle ground . . . between the extremes of legalizing all
drugs and bearing the costs of the zero tolerance approach.&quot;
Id. at 260. The author endorses the regulated sale of marijuana
with the use of law enforcement savings for anti-drug abuse
programs aimed at heroin and cocaine. Id. at 262. Prof. Nadelmann
has commented, and we agree, that: &quot;Today, studies similar
to that of the Wickesham Commission and the Rockefeller
Foundation report [on prohibition and alcohol-control strategies
respectively] are necessary to any systematic evaluation of drug
prohibition and its alternatives.&quot; Krauss &amp; Lazear,
supra, at 242. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>For the reasons above stated we agree with the emphasis of the
Report on further public dialog, harm reduction and drug
treatment but disagree with its conclusion that drug prohibition
should be ended. <br>
