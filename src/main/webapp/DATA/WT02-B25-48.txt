<P>
Severe and persistent mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, manic depression or clinical depression, are biologically based brain diseases.  More than one and a half million people's lives are affected in Florida.  State studies report more than 400,000 adults suffer from a severe mental illness and 150,000 children and adolescents are seriously emotionally disturbed.  These, together with family member care providers, add up to more than 1,500,000 Floridians.
<P>
Living with and being responsible for the care of a loved one with a catastrophic mental illness is a physically, emotionally and financially draining experience.
<P>
Due to meager or non-existent coverage in private health insurance policies, most families must rely on a public mental health service delivery system funded to serve only 20% of the need.
<P>
Recent legislative action curtailing the availability of Medicaid funds will further cripple an already seriously inadequate system.
<P>
To be able to cope effectively in this environment, families need resource information, education on treatment therapies, medications and on-going emotional support.  They then can deal more effectively with their family situation and reduce dependency on an already over-burdened system.
<P>
Families are increasingly the primary caregiver, and in too many cases, the sole caregiver.
<P>

<STRONG>Addressing the Problem:</STRONG>
<P>
The Florida Alliance for the Mentally Ill (FAMI) is a statewide nonprofit 501 c (3) organization that represents the largest collective voice of individuals in the state dedicated to improving the lives of people who suffer from a severe mental illness.  We were founded in 1984 by families to provide peer group support, educate the public about these illnesses, and advocate for the creation of strong social and health care support services at the local, state and national levels.  FAMI currently has 1600 families in 39 affiliates across Florida.  We are the state affiliate of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, having 140,000 families in 1,100 affiliates throughout the nation.
<P>
The potential influence of FAMI is enormous in helping to provide a better future for those who are mentally ill.  For family members, that is reason enough.  For others, your support will help lessen a huge societal problem causing billions of dollars in lost work productivity, rising medical costs, increased homelessness, and violence.
<P>
Treatment works!  The mentally ill can recover and lead productive, satisfying lives.  More can with access to proper care.  We have a big job to do.  We will succeed.  We must.

<STRONG>Program Description:</STRONG>
<P>
The JOURNEY OF HOPE Family Education Program is a 12 session course for families of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  The curriculum focuses on three major psychiatric illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression), emphasizing the clinical treatment of these illnesses and teaching the knowledge and skills family members need to cope more effectively with them.  Each weekly session runs for 2 1/2 hours and the course is taught by trained family member volunteers working in co-leader pairs.
<P>
Classes are held in neutral locations (churches, schools, libraries) to avoid the stigma many families associate with clinics and mental health centers.
<P>
On Our Own:  Family Members Serve As Teachers
<P>
The JOURNEY OF HOPE Family Education Program is the national outgrowth of an innovative family education project developed by AMI-Vermont in 1991.  Now in its fifth year, this successful family-to-family education curriculum taught exclusively by family members themselves.
<P>
From its inception, the program has been dedicated to the principle that family members can teach a course of considerable depth and complexity and can be depended upon to run a first-rate family education program without professional supervision.  Family member volunteers are given intensive training for this task, and after teaching one 12-week cycle of classes they are awarded a Family Education Specialist certificate.
<P>
There are many compelling reasons why we chose to design and use an educational program which empowers family members as teachers:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>We wish to recognize the value of family-based knowledge and skills

<LI>We want family members to be respected as capable, knowledgeable peers in the mental health system

<LI>We believe that individuals who have come through the travail of mental illness in their family make superb teachers and leaders

<LI>We think that family-member teachers represent a standard of self-learning and "know-how" that inspires other families

<LI>We want to be absolutely certain that our teachers reach out to families from the heart
</UL>
<P>

Additionally, we are eager to expand leadership opportunities within local AMI organizations, to identify new leaders around each state, and, encourage younger people to become a valuable part of our AMI work.
<P>
In the final course evaluation from participants across the country, the decision to use family-member teachers has been enthusiastically endorsed by families taking the course.  Teacher ratings are universally positive; many family members taking the course sign up for the next teacher training, providing a constantly growing "staff" of family educators in each state.  As a result of our teaching experience, many of use are getting more involved in education - running high school support groups, teaching university and medical classes, speaking to civic groups and organizing informational workshops for clergy and other interested professionals.  Family Education "on our own" is invigorating AMI state organizations, making us more determined as advocates, raising our level of expertise, and giving us a new sense of entitlement and confidence.
