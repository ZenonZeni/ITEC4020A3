Change Toward Ethiopian Press During<br>
Christopher&#146;s Visit to Addis Ababa<br>
</strong><br>
Policy Change Enacted After Review of CPJ Report<br>
Revealing More Journalists Imprisoned in Ethiopia in Past<br>
Three Years Than in Any Other African Country<br>
<br>
New York&#139; U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher today declined the<br>
Ethiopian government&#146;s invitation to hold a joint press conference upon his<br>
arrival in Addis Ababa. This, in response to a report by the New York-based<br>
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) detailing the legal harassment and<br>
imprisonment of Ethiopian journalists, and the government&#146;s systematic<br>
exclusion of the private press from official press conferences. State Department<br>
Spokesperson Nicholas Burns told the Committee&#146;s chair, Kati Marton, that<br>
CPJ&#146;s report Clampdown in Addis: Ethiopia&#146;s Journalists at Risk led to the<br>
policy change.<br>
<br>
In a public statement, Secretary of State Christopher told reporters,<br>
&#147;Ethiopia has made progress in human rights during the past five years, but the<br>
United States wants to see more. One of the areas of our concern is the<br>
freedom of the press and the treatment of journalists.&#148; <br>
<br>
CPJ&#146;s report is based on a fact-finding mission conducted last May by<br>
Africa Program Coordinator Kakuna Kerina, who wrote the report, and CPJ 
board<br>
member and Newsday U.N. bureau chief Josh Friedman, who wrote the<br>
report&#146;s introductory essay. Based on more than 50 interviews with<br>
government officials, journalists and other sources, the report demonstrates how<br>
independent journalists are regularly harassed, censored and jailed under the<br>
provisions of a restrictive press law enacted in 1992. The repressive climate exists<br>
despite promises of press freedom made by the Transitional Government of 
Ethiopia<br>
(TGE) in 1991 and by the recently elected Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who<br>
served as TGE president. Clampdown in Addis, which was released on<br>
October 7 -- the day Ethiopia&#146;s Parliament reconvened to address key media<br>
issues -- made several recommendations to the Meles administration, and<br>
called on the United States and other Western countries to take a more<br>
aggressive role in encouraging the Ethiopian government to uphold guarantees of 
press<br>
freedom.<br>
<br>
&#147;Secretary of State Christopher&#146;s position is a welcome step toward<br>
what CPJ hopes will be a continued U.S. government commitment to press 
freedom and<br>
support for Ethiopia&#146;s independent journalists,&#148; said Kerina. &#147;We look<br>
forward to the time when the Ethiopian government views the private press as an<br>
ally, not an enemy, in the democratic process.&#148; <br>

its headquarters in New York, CPJ works to get detained journalists out<br>
of jail, directs international campaigns of protest against repressive<br>
governments, and provides practical safety information to reporters assigned to<br>
dangerous areas. CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, and does not accept 
any<br>
government funding.<br>
