<p><font size = 4>  In today's world of ever increasing
technology, much of what had been the written word is now the
Cyberspace word.  Much of what had been printed and transmitted
by mail, or overnight delivery or facsimile, is now sent by
e-mail or on-line group session.  In short, messages that would
have required a few days or a few hours to prepare and deliver
five years ago, can now be transmitted electronically within
seconds.  All well and good, but what does this have to do with
the law, you might ask? </p>

<p>  Perhaps the most important step in determining someone's
rights or defenses in an actual or potential lawsuit is
determining what the evidence will show if a case is brought to
trial.  One of the most compelling forms of evidence is the
written word.  Judges and juries can hold documents and read them
for themselves.  When they look at contemporaneously prepared
documents, they often conclude they do not necessarily need to
decide whether the testimony (like from a live witness in Court)
is truthful.  Many times the fact that something appears in a
document, usually generated years prior to the trial, is enough. 
Interesting observation, you say, but what does this have to do
with technology or e-mail? </p>

<p>  When writers needed to put pen to paper (literally) or at
least had to type text (or have someone type it for them) and
then sign the document so that it could be physically delivered,
they usually took a fair amount of care to make certain that they
meant what they wrote and were willing to abide by what they
wrote.  The very process of creating the document tended to make
the writer think about it, sometimes edit it, and in general
appreciate that the document might come back to "haunt" him if he
did not really mean what he wrote. </p>

<p> Now, the fact is that many companies use electronic mail as a
means of allowing employees to communicate with each other, both
in the same office and around the country.  In addition, many of
us have personal computers, laptops and notebooks that we use to
communicate with the office while at home.  Add to that the
number of people who use e-mail on a more personal level over the
Internet, and the number of people who participate in on-line
talk sessions (whether at work or through postings to Usenet or other newsgroups or in "chat
rooms), and it soon becomes apparent that the Cyber "document"
touches nearly everyone.  Indeed, it is an extremely efficient
means of communication. </p>

<p>  The problem with e-mail and on-line sessions is that many
people believe or assume that those methods of communication
afford anonymity or at least represent an ephemeral exchange
similar to the spoken word.  (Anyone who has ever participated in
an "I said versus you said" argument realizes that the merely
spoken word addressed to but one witness can be very difficult to
reconstruct much less pin down.) </p>

<p>  This view about Cyberdocuments, that they are much like
quarks -- fleeting at best -- comes partly from the "chat-group"
and "screen name" culture born from the Internet and the newsgroups of the Usenet.  In
most cases this view is not well founded.  In addition, many
people believe or assume that an e-mail message exists only until
it is read and then erased by the recipient; then, they think,
it's gone.  For some reason, as a result of these factors, people
transmit messages via e-mail, post messages to newsgroups or make remarks on-line that they
would never commit to writing (recall some of the e-mail messages
you have seen or heard about).  This is a huge mistake. </p>

<p>  Most e-mail systems do not afford anonymity.  The same is
true of on-line sessions.  And most office network systems that
link office computers use some form of data backup, be it tape or
optical disk.  The backup programs are designed to periodically
back up all data on a system, until all of the backed-up data is
transformed onto long term storage media.  As a practical matter
this means that a large percentage of e-mail messages, whether or
not erased by the recipient after being read, are backed up and
then stored with all of the other computer data on disks and
tapes.  Even in the Usenet world, efforts are underway to devise
means for archival study of years of prior sessions (one such approach
being the <cite>Deja News</cite> search engine). </p>

<p>  Additionally, it is usually very easy to capture a screen or
print an e-mail.  Someone who participated in the communication
process can generally do that legally.  Indeed, while there are
some variations in different states, most of the "privacy"
protection that the law affords deals only with "eavesdropping"
type activity.  And in a lawsuit, when the information becomes
relevant, the courts will often demand production of the material
even if an eavesdropper gathered it or the party who sent it
thought the information was "private" or "off the record."  (Of
course, truly privileged material, such as privileged
communications with a lawyer or a clergyman, usually have a
different legal analysis that applies to them)</p>

<p>  Good lawyers know this all too well.  As a result, requests
for copies of all stored or printed e-mail messages are
frequently made in divorce cases, business disputes,
sex-harassment cases, product liability cases, and almost any
other type of case where what a person says is at issue.  The
American legal system has as one of its most fundamental tenets
the search for truth.  Judges therefore with increasing frequency
order that these back-up and printed copy records be produced in
such litigations.  Even the President of the United States
confronts this problem.  The Reagan White House had, by Court
order, to preserve e-mail backup files as part of the <cite>Iran-Contra</cite> investigation. 
President Clinton had to produce
computer back up in connection with the <cite>Whitewater</cite>
investigation. </p>
 
<p>  A good rule of thumb, and one that we advise our clients, is
this: If you would not put your message in a written letter on
your personal (or company) stationery, then you should not
transmit it via e-mail, or in most instances in any other form,
especially in the workplace.  It really comes down to the
application of common sense . . . and the realization that, just
because you didn't send it in a hard copy writing, <blink><font
color = "#ff0000">that doesn't mean that it doesn't
exist!</blink></font></p>
