Many economists see low unemployment (and rising wages) as the main component of price inflation. If the selection of available workers is low, then an employer may have to pay more to get the right staff. Unions bargain for their members from a position of strength in such an environment. This news sent the bond markets into a tailspin, causing the biggest one day trading losses in over four months.The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 114 points, reflecting fears that the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates to control the economy. As I've pointed out several times in the past months, The Fed. is trying very hard to accommodate the Incumbent on his bid for a November re-election. Bill Clinton has claimed credit for the low unemployment figure-a politically sound strategy. But he must now hope that The Fed. can stave off any big interest rate hikes for the next few months. In early 1997, after a successful re-election, The Fed. can tighten to its heart's content.<p>My long term bet on longer term bond yields is a rise to 7.00 to 7.5%. The US 10 year T Bond Index chart shows just over 7% now.<p>I notice that the CRB Index seems to be attempting a rally, indicating from another source, that inflation is still lurking out there. In Canada, our economy is diverging from the US. Also on Friday, we announced that our unemployment rate had <i>risen</i> and was now over 10%. Our bond and stock markets did not get hurt as badly as our neighbours to the South. Our economy seems to be muddling along.<p>I have recommended buying bonds and will stay with that strategy. Our bond indicator,  The Govt. of Canada bonds of 2011, has lost a little ground since the recommendation, but my Stop Loss point remains under $106.00, which is still about $2.50 below present levels.<p>One useful counterpoint to the inflation scenario came from that recent talk with Steve Misener of BPI Capital. Steve does not see an upsurge of inflation, because he sees inflation fear as strictly a US phenomenon. Worldwide inflation requires worldwide participation. He remarked that the world divides into three trade blocks, Asia, Europe and North plus Central America. Most analysts agree that Japan has more to fear from deflation than inflation. Japan has also protected themselves against currency inflation by moving manufacturing facilities offshore. In Europe, Germany's manufacturing powerhouse has copied Japan by moving manufacturing to cheaper countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In the America's, Canada and Mexico are not enjoying the economic expansion (and inflation fears) that are prevalent in the States. Steve believes that the #1 cause of inflation is labour costs, yet the world's major manufacturing centres are moving their production plants to low cost countries. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.
