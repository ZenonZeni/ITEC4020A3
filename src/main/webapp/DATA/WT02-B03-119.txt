<H1>Answers to Some Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
<P>by Charlotte Gerson</P>
<HR><P>In his last book, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
 A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases</A>, Dr. Max Gerson
incorporated the experiences, trials and errors of a
lifetime. He especially needed to record the details of his
work with advanced and terminal cancer patients. For these
patients he had to fine-tune his therapy to the ultimate
degree, to obtain the best foods and juice extraction, the
most carefully adjusted medications, and the most thorough
detoxification. He did this with very specific directions:
how to do the enemas, how best to extract the juices, and so
forth. Over the years, various authors have proposed their
own ideas in the above areas, often differing from Dr.
Gerson's. This has naturally raised questions for patients
using the Therapy, as well as others interested in the theory
and practice of the Gerson Therapy. I would like to explain
some of the reasons underlying Dr. Gerson's detailed
instructions in these areas. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#juicer">
Juicers </A> </P>
<P>The juicing is so tedious, with all the grinding and
pressing. Isn't there an easier and faster way, or a cheaper
juicer that I could use? </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson said in his address to a group assembled in
Escondido, California in 1956 (Appendix II, p. 406, <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A>): &quot;At first I thought that
liquefiers would be the most wonderful thing. All the
material was there, nothing was lost. But it didn't
work.&quot; The rotating blade gives rise to a &quot;dynamo
effect&quot;, causing electricity to be generated, and
killing enzymes. The same is true for centrifugal juicers.
Juices must be made by grinding the vegetables first, mixing
them, and then pressing them in a press. We have recently
come across cancer patients who tried to heal themselves on
the Gerson Therapy using a centrifugal juicer. They
experienced no improvement. When they tried the Therapy with
Champion juicers, they did well. The more seriously ill
patients still need the grinding plus pressing type of juicer
arrangement to properly heal. </P>
<P>In response to a question from a patient about the two
step juicing process, Dr. Gerson wrote that &quot;the malic
acid (contained in the apples) mixed with the ground carrots
helps to release the minerals from the carrots.&quot; In
other words, it is necessary to first grind the apples and
carrots together into a bowl, using a grinder. The Norwalk,
K&amp;K or Champion juicers can be used as grinders, but the
Champion cannot be used as a press. The ground materials are
mixed in the bowl, the mixture is placed in a press cloth and
put under pressure in the Norwalk or K&amp;K press. This
process produces the best extraction, richest in minerals,
and the tastiest juice. Juice produced by the Champion juicer
alone separates into a transparent liquid at the bottom and
mush on top after a very short time. This juice is harder for
the patient to drink because of the particles, and is not as
rich and homogeneous in nutrients. </P>
<P>Recently the Green Power juicer was introduced. It does a
better job of extraction than the Champion alone used as a
juicer. But it offers no way (as the Champion does) to block
the juicing action. It is impossible to use the Green Power
juicer as a grinder only, it grinds and juices in one
operation. While it extracts juice quite efficiently, it does
not fulfill Dr. Gerson's requirement of mixing the ground
apples and carrots thoroughly before pressing. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#coffee">
Enemas </A> </P>
<P>I thought that high colonics cleaned out the entire
colon. Why shouldn't one do high colonics? Aren't we trying
to clear out the colon? </P>
<P>Anyone who is at all familiar with the Gerson Therapy is
well aware of the utmost importance of the coffee enemas.
(Gerson Healing Newsletter #13, May, 1986). But questions
arise from Dr. Gerson's instructions, specifically his
warning: NO HIGH COLONICS. High colonics don't accomplish
what coffee enemas do, namely, open the liver/bile ducts to
allow the liver to release toxins. They also interfere with
basic colonic functions: reabsorption of nutrients, vitamins
and fluids, especially when used regularly. </P>
<P>Let us first examine the basics. Dr. Gerson found that
the underlying problems of all cancer patients are toxicity
and deficiency. He had to overcome both these difficulties.
He found that one of the important features of his therapy
had to be the hourly administration of fresh vegetable
juices. These supply ample nutrients, as well as fluids to
help flush out the kidneys. When the high levels of nutrients
re-enter tissues, toxins accumulated over many years are
forced into the blood stream. The toxins are then filtered
out by the liver. The liver is easily overburdened by the
continuous release of toxins and is unable to release the
load. This can cause liver damage, even liver coma -- unless
the liver is helped to release the overload. Dr. Gerson found
that he could provide help to the liver by the caffeine in
coffee, absorbed from the colon via the hemorrhoidal vein,
which carries the caffeine to the portal system and then to
the liver. The caffeine stimulates the liver/bile ducts to
open, releasing the poisons into the intestinal tract for
excretion. </P>
<P>High colonics are usually not done with coffee, and
therefore do not benefit the liver. Even if coffee were to be
used, a high colonic forces it high into the transverse and
ascending colon, where it is not absorbed into the portal
system. </P>
<P>With the constant administration of vegetable juices of
the Gerson Therapy, a flood of toxins is steadily released
from the poisoned cells in the body. Four to five coffee
enemas daily are needed to help continuously unburden the
liver, and deal with the toxins. It would be impossible, even
dangerous, to do five high colonics daily. </P>
<P>Colonics have another undesirable effect. The colon is a
very important recycling organ which reabsorbs fluids,
enzymes and minerals. It also produces some vitamins with the
help of friendly bacteria. Regular high colonics disturb this
activity, flushing out essential minerals, enzymes and
friendly bacteria along with the waste materials. This could
lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (washing out
too many of the minerals the body needs). </P>
<P>If a patient wishes to use one or two high colonics prior
to starting the Gerson Therapy, we have no objection. But the
often-suggested course of 15 or 30 colonics should not be
undertaken. In addition, it is possible to stretch the colon
and lose some of its normal muscle function. </P>
<P>Most doctors and nurses are taught to have the patient
lie on the left side to take their enemas. Dr. Gerson wanted
the patient to lie on his right side. With the patient in
this position, gravity will help the coffee flow past the
descending colon, just around the &quot;corner&quot; of the
splenic flexure, and into the transverse colon for higher
penetration and better release of toxic feces. </P>
<P>One more important note: When using the castor oil enema,
it is necessary to add some soap to the coffee/castor oil
solution so the oil does not float to the top. Do not grate
soap into the solution. Too much soap will irritate and
inflame the colon. Just rub a cake of soap for a few moments
with your hand immersed in the (liquid) coffee. This will
release enough soap to do the job. </P>
<P><A href="ref.html#flaxoil">
Flax Seed Oil </A> </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson strongly prohibited any fats or oils, yet <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A> says to use flax seed oil. What is the
source of this contradiction? </P>
<P>Dr. Gerson was very much aware that patients require the
intake of essential fatty acids. He experimented with various
substances, including sunflower, safflower, olive and other
oils to try to satisfy this need. He even tried fresh,
unsalted butter. In all cases, fats administered to patients,
even after they were already free of tumor tissue, caused the
regrowth of cancers. Therefore, Dr. Gerson stated repeatedly
and emphatically when describing the practice of the Therapy
&quot;NO OILS, NO FATS.&quot; </P>
<P>In 1958, after his book had been published, Gerson found
the work of Dr. Johanna Budwig. Dr. Budwig described her
successful use of flax seed oil (linseed oil) in cancer
patients. Dr. Gerson tried this substance and found it very
beneficial. It supplies the essential fatty acids, helps to
carry Vitamin A through the blood stream and supplies
linoleic and linolenic acids. </P>
<P>In a letter to his long-time friend, Dr. Albert
Schweitzer, Gerson described his protocol for the use of Flax
Seed Oil: two tablespoons a day for the first month on the
Gerson Therapy; one tablespoon thereafter. This prescription
seems to be in conflict with Dr. Gerson's injunction of NO
OILS, NO FATS. In the charts on pp. 235 and 236 of <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy</A>, the reader will find that the use of
flax seed oil is described. The reason for the
&quot;contradiction&quot; is that, on the basis of Dr.
Gerson's research in the last year of his practice, we added
the flax seed oil prescription. We did not change the text in
the book prohibiting all fats and oils, because we wanted to
keep Dr. Gerson's original words as intact as possible. We
hope that this explains any apparent contradictions the
reader may find. </P>
<P>Flax seed oil is made from organic flax seed, cold
pressed, bottled in a light-tight container, and sealed in
the presence of inert gas, not air. This careful handling
keeps the oil from oxidizing, and becoming rancid. It must
never be heated, and should never be used to cook, bake or
fry anything. Unopened bottles may be stored in a freezer for
up to six months; in a refrigerator for up to three months.
Once opened and exposed to air, still refrigerated, the oil
is only usable for three weeks. </P>
<P>Patients should use the <A href="ref.html#flaxoil">
golden, filtered oil </A>, not the brownish and viscous
material that includes lignins. The lignins come from part of
the fiber of the seed, which also contains certain
undesirable proteins. These should be avoided. Also, when
used by patients, only the oil should be taken, not freshly
ground flax seeds, for the same reason. Some patients have
been told by well-meaning friends that lignins or flax powder
can be used and added to cakes. That is totally out of the
question. </P>
<P><B>&quot;Medical Hell&quot;</B> </P>
<P>At the end of May, 1995, a patient was admitted to the
therapy <A href="center.html">
hospital </A> suffering from pancreatic cancer. Patients are
requested to bring their medical records with them, and this
patient brought his doctor's consultation and operation
(biopsy) report along. This young man is only 38 years old,
and has a fairly healthy lifestyle. I do not understand why
he has such a serious problem at this early age. He gave me a
copy of his medical report and, I must admit, I read it in
amazement and disbelief. Since it is so incredible, I am
quoting two paragraphs here exactly as they appear on the
report. </P>
<P>&quot;I have explained to the patient the absence of
surgical resolution of the problem [inoperable] and he will
be seen by the Cancer Clinic and we'll discuss the role or
non-role of chemo and radiotherapy in this condition. The
gravity of his illness was explained to him. At the moment,
he's in a state of denial and shock, but certainly his father
[who is an MD] and wife are well aware of the seriousness of
the situation. </P>
<P>&quot;This man was informed of the diagnosis in the
absence of all involved regular physicians by one of the
family physicians covering for Dr. D. D. in Campbell River.
This at least prepared him for the descent into hell of
having the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas that he is now
embarked upon ...&quot; </P>
<P>We have seen a number of patients showing total
recoveries from pancreatic cancer, even when it has spread to
the bile duct, spleen, or further. We are often accused of
quackery and &quot;giving desperately ill people false
hope.&quot; Even if our patients do not all recover, we do
give them hope, not false hope, rather than despair. Is the
above medical report an example of compassionate &quot;health
care&quot; providers? <IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">
