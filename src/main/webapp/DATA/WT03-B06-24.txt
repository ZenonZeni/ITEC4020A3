Vietnam: World Bank pledges more loan commitments

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The World Bank plans to offer Vietnam loans of US$1.5 billion over
the three financial years 1997-1999 in the second capital
supplementation from its agency, the International Development
Association (IDA).

The good news was announced by the director of the Asia-Pacific
Department of the World Bank, Javad Khalilzadeh Shirazi, during his
visit to Vietnam last week to review two years of implementation of
the IDA-funded projects and discuss preparations for the 4th
consulting conference of international donors for Vietnam in Hanoi
late this year. During talks with Deputy PM Phan Van Khai, Shirazi
expressed good impressions of Vietnam's economic reform and
promised that the World Bank will continue to help Vietnam settle
debts through the London Club.

According to the International Relations Department of the State
Bank, the World Bank has announced the list of projects expected to
receive its funding in the financial years 1997-1998-1999 with
respective amounts of US$641 million, US$458 million and US$345
million. The projects are related to rural and urban transport,
tertiary education, power transmission, agriculture, energy, water
resources and other fields.

In financial years 1993-1996, the WB approved loans for 12 projects
totalling US$1,275 million with 11 projects already signed,
excluding a rural transport project worth US$54 million under
negotiation. Since October 1993, it has organized three conferences
of international donors for Vietnam with the total loans committed
amounting to US$1.7-US$2 billion each year. Vietnam is now the
second largest recipient of WB loans after India.

Vietnam: Largest BOT investment in power sector

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The U.S. energy company Oxbow International has been selected as
investor of the Hoanh Bo Thermopower Plant (300MW), Vietnam's first
BOT (build-operate-transfer) project in the power sector.

The project, to be built in Hoanh Bo District, Quang Ninh Province
with an investment captal of US$300 million, will use the world's
most modern technology in thermopower production and all the low
energy coal available in Quang Ninh (about 1.2 million tons/year)
as fuel. It will supply power to factories and industrial zones in
Hanoi, Haiphong and Quang Ninh and possibly to southern provinces
of China.

The project is due to start operation in 1999 and will be
transferred to Vietnam after 20 years.

At present, another BOT project in the power sector is under the
Government's consideration. The project, to be located in Ba
Ria-Vung Tau Province, is a diesel-powered plant with a capacity of
120 MW, which will be invested by the Finnish company Wartsila.
Total investment capital is US$110 million.

Vietnam: Preferential tariff for EU imports

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The General Department of Customs has issued detailed guidelines to
implement the tariff reduction for goods imported from the European
Union (EU) in the two years of 1996 and 1997.

According to Circular 2610/TCHQ-KTTT dated Aug.14, goods from the
EU can enjoy import tax reduction if they meet the following
requirements: stated in the nomenclature issued in conjunction with
Decree 18/CP on the list of goods and tariffs to implement the
import tax reduction program for goods imported from the EU,
ensuring the standard on origin in accordance with the general
stipulations of the Agreement on Textiles and Garments of the EU,
and possession of the certificate of origin, form A issued by
competent authorities from the EU.

Goods recognized to originate from the EU must meet one of the
following requirements:

-Wholly produced or exploited in an EU country,
-Produced in an EU country with part or all of the materials, parts
or components completely processed in this country. Textiles and
garments in this case must undergo at least two stages of
processing.
- The final product made in an EU country, in which products
meeting the EU origin requirement have been used.

The circular also states that goods imported from the EU can only
enjoy preferential tariff if they are transported to Vietnam
directly from an EU country or via the ports of a number of EU
countries. The goods can also be transported via the ports of
non-EU countries but the transit is necessary due to geographical
reasons or transport demand.

Vietnam: A proper dose for beer production

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Deputy PM Phan Van Khai requested the Ministry of Industry and the
Vietnam Beer, Liquor and Beverage Corporation (Vinabeco) to
re-organize the chaos in beer and wine production.

During his recent working session with the corporation, Khai
complained that beer factories have been built in many localities
without proper planning and market study. At present, 46 out of 53
provinces in Vietnam have beer enterprises, many of which,
including joint ventures, suffer losses and become a burden for the
State budget. Khai warned that Vietnamese partners must carefully
select foreign partners to establish beer JVs and increase their
stakes in the JVs. He instructed the Ministry and concerned
authorities to prepare  a plan for the development of beer, liquor
and beverage production and to reorganize existing factories,
adding that small and ineffective companies should be dissolved
before licenses are granted to new businesses.

Vinabeco produced 103 million liters of beer, 10.5 million liters
of beverages and 740,000 liters of liquor in the first half of this
year. Compared with the same period of 1995, the beer production
increased by 17 million liters and beverages by 22.1 million liters
but liquor decreased by 97,000 liters. To increase competiveness,
Vinabeco will establish a trading company to distribute all the
products of its affiliated units. It now has 2,091 sale agents
nation-wide with sales reaching over VND1 trillion in the first
half of this year, accounting for 51% of its yearly target.

Vietnam: Trade review after a decade of doi moi

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A conference to review trade activities during the ten years of doi
moi and discuss measures to increase the effectiveness of trading
enterprises and set goals and directions for the period 1996-2000
was held in HCMC recently by the Ministry of Trade.

According to reports at the conference, by the end of 1995, there
were 1,900 State enterprises, 6,000 private enterprises, over 2,000
limited liability companies, 35 joint stock companies and one
million households engaged in trade. However, only 30% of the
enterprises operate at a profit; 40% have normal operations but
with little profit and face capital shortage and debts and 30%
suffer losses. On average, 10 enterprises suffered losses annually
in the past five years.

The goals of the trade sector for the 1996-2000 five-year plan are
to increase sales by 2.5 times compared with 1995 with an average
growth rate of 20%/year, export turnover by 28-32%/year to reach
US$18-20 billion by 2000, and import turnover by 24-28%/year to
reach US$22-25 billion by 2000.

Measures to reach these goals include re-organizing State
enterprises with modern business methods, equitizing part or all of
the assets of these enterprises, defining the mechanism,
responsibility and authority of the State ownership for the
enterprise and upgrading the qualification of sales personnel.

In the first eight months of this year, domestic trade developed
well thanks to an abundant supply of goods which could meet 95% of
domestic consumers' demand. Along with this, price fevers due to
shortage of goods did not occur and inflation was curbed at 2.2%.
However, there are signs of a surplus of goods due to over-imports
and increased domestic production while purchasing power rose
slowly. The trade sector expects to reach total sales of VND180
trillion this year.

According to the Ministry of Trade, Vietnam has trading relations
with 105 countries and territories and has signed trade agreements
with over 60 countries. Trading activities attract over two million
people, contribute to 34% of total budget revenues (excluding
revenues from JVs with foreign partners) and account for 14% of the
GDP.

Vietnam: Press Highlights, September 13-20, 1996

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A weekly review of issues featured in the local press

By TRAN TRONG THUC - HCMC

The first ASEAN Football Cup, Tiger Cup 96, obscured other events
last week as it dominated the front pages of major newspapers.
Readers not only closely read the comments on the Cup by sports
writers but also put football on top of their discussions in
schools and offices, especially the glory and gloom of the
Vietnamese team playing on Singapore grounds.

HCMC-based newspapers, such as Sai Gon Giai Phong (Saigon
Liberation), Tuoi Tre (Youth), Nguoi Lao Dong (Laborer) and Thanh
Nien (Youngsters), seemed to put more emphasis on this sporting
tournament than their centrally run and northern counterparts. The
Tuoi Tre ran the headline "50 Minutes of Collapse, 40 Minutes of
Revival" for its report on the semi-final match in which Vietnam
lost to Thailand 2-4. The Tuoi Tre Sunday featured a cogent
commentary affirming Vietnamese football has attained regional high
ranking status.

The Sai Gon Giai Phong also reported the Vietnamese team's matches
on its front page but printed no comments. Lao Dong's (Labor)
sports section highlighted a long article concluding that the
Vietnamese team showed better performance than it did in the 18th
Sea Games last year. Tiger Cup '96 came to an end on September 15
with Vietnam ranking third after Thailand and Malaysia.

However, the Vietnamese press has made some spontaneous remarks in
a few articles on this sports event. The national team and,
particularly, chief coach Karl Weigang were extolled when winning
but disparaged every time they suffered losses. The Tuoi Tre
published an interview with an indecent query, "Mr. Weigang, when
do you think you will be dismissed?" On that day, the newspaper
received many phone calls from readers in response to the question.
"Weigang has both merits and problems," was the Tuoi Tre answer.
This explanation complies with the contents of a book to be
marketed late this month entitled, "The Unknowns of Vietnamese
Football."

Meanwhile, the lead economic story of the week was an interview
with an official from the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI)
covered by the Nguoi Lao Dong. Headlined "Revised Bill on Foreign
Investment: More Attractive and Reasonable," the interview showed
that Vietnam's law on foreign investment will be amended so that it
will create more favorable conditions for investors. Some examples
of new advantages are: reduced time for investment evaluation,
permission to pool in capital in Vietnamese currency, expansion of
the joint venture form, and elongation of the tax holiday period.

More than one month ago, a Tuoi Tre investigative report on
Vietnam-ese women marrying Taiwanese men aroused public attention.
Last week, the HCMC-based Phu Nu (Women) showed even more of the
bitter reality by publishing an article quoting sources from the
Taiwanese press. This women's newspaper contended that the
Taiwanese story on the service of marrying Vietnamese, and
Taiwanese stipulations on marriages with foreigners are a
humiliation to Vietnamese women. The Phu Nu went as far as
proposing that the law should rule that only foreign men with
adequate health, education and income, and without handicaps are
qualified to marry Vietnamese women. Of course, these are only
proposals for consideration.

Vietnam: Investment Environment Remains Attractive

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Many people have been concerned about the fact that foreign-direct
investment (FDI) has fallen into a decline as the investment
environment has proven problematic while the pressure of
competition from other regional countries has strongly increased.
Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Nhac talks about
this issue.

Could you talk about the situation of FDI since early this year?

By August 20 this year, the Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI) had licensed 186 projects, worth some US$4.35 billion. Of
this sum, the build-operate-transfer project for the international
seaport Sao Mai-Ben Dinh in Vung Tau makes up US$637 million, and
the float glass plant of Japanese Asahi in Song Be Province US$125
million. In the same period last year, total registered capital of
licensed projects was over US$4.57 billion.

So this indicates a slight decline in FDI?

In my opinion, we should first examine whether or not foreign
investors are still interested in seeking business opportunities or
investment projects in the country once the tempo of FDI influx is
mentioned. Between the beginning of the year and August 20, the
ministry received 237 projects, with total registered capital
reaching US$7.25 billion compared with US$4.94 billion in the same
period last year. Currently, many projects have not yet been
licensed as they are big and important; therefore, it takes time to
consider them carefully.

Between now and the end of the year, it is certain that the
government will license a number of large projects such as Dung
Quat Oil Refinery No.1 (US$1.5 billion), Quang Ninh 300 MW
thermo-power plant and a Vietnam-Hyundai ship-building yard. In
addition, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has assigned the relevant
State agencies to map out policies and regulations regarding
several pilot urban development projects with the involvement of
foreign investors such as those in An Khanh, Thu Duc District,
HCMC, and on the outskirts of Hanoi.

I often follow the foreign press and see that some say the tempo of
FDI influx into Vietnam has stayed constant. However, they used
figures of a particular week or month as proof. Several foreign
news agencies have even tried to assert that we plan to reduce the
amount of FDI into the country by inventing statistics which we
have not ever seen before.

Some people are worried that the country's investment environment
is not attractive and is discouraging foreign investors. They refer
to a number of cases including the recent inspection of
foreign-invested projects and the withdrawal of investment
licenses.

It is necessary for functional State agencies to carry out
inspections periodically to find whether foreign-invested
enterprises need any assistance in resolving unexpected problems or
abiding by stipulations in their licenses and Vietnamese laws. This
is ordinary State management work, which foreign businesses are
willing to agree on and cooperate. Foreign newspapers have
mentioned a number of projects whose licenses have been pulled back
before expiry in an attempt to prove that the country's investment
environment has become worse. There is nothing abnormal in
withdrawing licenses from unfeasible and unprofitable projects
prior to expiry. I was very interested in the opinion of an
Australian high trade commissioner in Vietnam; when asked about the
withdrawal of Australian BHP from an oil exploitation project, this
commissioner noted that this is very common everywhere around the
world.

Vietnam's potential rivals from regional countries concern many
people. Could you please analyze the advantages which the country
has in attracting FDI?

Competition has always existed, therefore, we have to accept the
challenges. I think that, at present, the competitive edges which
play the most important role in luring FDI are Vietnam's
development requirements, stability on a macro-scale, and
participation in the ASEAN Free Trade Area. Some foreign
conglomerates, such as Japanese Sanyo and South Korean Daewoo, tend
to set foot in the country as a stepping-stone to expand their
markets to the whole region. They are planning to move their plants
to Vietnam and to export products back to their countries. Vietnam
also has other advantages including low-cost labor and land.

In the future, what measures will the Government adopt to raise the
FDI influx to a higher level?

We are designing policies to attract FDI not only with higher
quantity, but also higher quality. To actualize these policies, the
amended Foreign Investment Law will be presented to the National
Assembly for approval in October this year. This amended law will
contain articles intended to provide preferential treatment for the
State-promoted areas, accelerate administrative reforms, and
improve the investment environment and the efficiency of State
management in FDI activities. In addition, there may be some other
articles stipulating that investors can file complaints and
litigate if Government officials process formalities slowly or
intentionally cause difficulties. I believe that the country's
economic development strategies, legal framework, improved
investment environment, and comparative advantages will certainly
attract the FDI influx into Vietnam.

Vietnam's post & telecom updates

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

* According to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),
Vietnam ranks second in the world in telecom development with a
growth rate of 70%/year. The statement was made after the ITU
completed a comprehensive study of the telecom development
worldwide.

The ITU also reported that Vietnam is the 60th out of 205 countries
which has one million telephones and uses 95% of digital electronic
exchanges.

* According to Vietnamese experts in the post and telecom sector,
to meet increasing demands in the future, Vietnam must expand
operations by fivefold from the present level. Mai Liem Truc,
general director of Vietnam Post and Telecom Corporation (VNPT),
said that the telecom sector must invest over VND3,000 billion to
reach the goal of 5-6 telephones/100 people by the year 2000.

By late August, VNPT had reached one million telephone subscribers,
a milestone marking the rapid development of the telecom sector.
This has made Vietnam an attractive market for international
telecom companies. At present, over 30 of the world's telecom
giants are operating  in Vietnam and US$750 million in FDI have
been poured into this sector.

* At present, there are over one million telephones in Vietnam or
more than one set/100 people. Post and telecom authorities have
plans to increase the telephone ratio to 5-6 sets/100 people by the
year 2000, raising the number of phone lines to 4.1 million by 2000
(in particular HCMC and Hanoi: 20 sets/100 people). Also, in this
period, the fiber optic cable linking Vietnam, China, Laos,
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand will be built and satellite
communications will be expanded with the launch of a telecom
satellite expected in 1999.

Referring to the corporation's trading program in the initial stage
(1996-2000), General Director Trinh Dinh Khuong said that it will
implement post and telecom activities in the first year (1996): The
Co Giang Post Center will be put into operation with such services
as parcel and package delivery and remittance; the corporation will
act as an agent introducing and trading in input-output equipment
(two to three outlets in the city) and as an agent for other postal
services.

The Saigon Postel Corp. will also prepare a design to construct a
telecom-informatics-electronics hi-tech park on a 40-ha area in Thu
Duc District. Later, the corporation will develop two to three
centers with 10-20 branches in cities and provinces nationwide. At
the same time, the corporation will carry out, step by step,
cordless and mobile phone services from Tay Ninh, Dong Nai and Vung
Tau to the Mekong Delta, Hanoi and Haiphong.

In addition, by the year 2000 the corporation will put a joint
venture into operation which will manufacture and assemble
telecommunication equipment with an estimated capacity averaging
200,000-250,000 items per annum, of which 50 percent will be for
export.

The corporation will also take preparatory steps to participate, if
permitted, in the national satellite program and project of
investing in and operating services via satellite.

This is the third entity specializing in the post and telecom area
following the Vietnam Post and Telecom Corp. (VNPT) and the
Military Telecom Co.

Vietnam: Health Care Equality

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The living standards of the people have been increasing constantly
with the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and so has the
demand for medical care. However, can people from different strata
of the population receive equal treatment in health care?

By Phuong Anh

Upgrading medical care

The document "Oriented strategies of medical care and health
protection for the population by the years 2000 and 2020," prepared
by the Health Ministry clearly stated, "To invest in the
population's health is actually to invest in the national
socio-economic development, and we must strive to improve our
people's health to the average level of the nations in the region."

Health Minister Do Nguyen Phuong predicted: In 2000 there will be
419 doctors for every one million people, 700 general hospitals at
provincial level and 10,000 fully equipped dispensaries for
ordinary medical care nationwide, and each person will spend US$8
per year on average for medicine. Meanwhile, the Ministry will
gradually diversify the forms of medical care and treatment with
various types of hospitals: State-run, joint venture and private,
but State-run health care will play the leading role. The creation
of these forms of health care must meet the actual demand of the
population and by no means should health care be commercialized.

At present, there is one private hospital charging low fees in
Quang Nam - Da Nang Province. In the future, there will be more
hospitals of this type to meet the demands of the population. In
the meantime, the Health Ministry is focusing on building two
specialized medical centers in Hanoi and HCM City by decision of
the Prime Minister in July 1995 with the objective to elevate
medical service to the level of hospitals in some countries of the
region.

The specialized medical center in Hanoi, the first to be built,
will be operating late this year. It will receive technical support
from four hospitals and a college; the Bach Mai Hospital for
instance, will assist with laboratory tests, emergency and recovery
and endoscopy.

The specialized medical center in HCM City is also under
construction. At the moment, partner hospitals and colleges are
being selected. Other specialized medical centers will be built
thereafter in Central Vietnam and other economic zones. Yet, the
development of Vietnam's medical system is still inadequate since
it cannot cover every part of the country and big differences in
care and treatment exist between urban and rural areas, the poor
and the rich.

Equality in medical services

Implementing the policy of equality of the Party and Government,
the Ministry of Health maintains three systems of medical coverage:
medical insurance, free of charge, and payable service.

Medical insurance covers only public servants and people working in
some non-State enterprises. Free services are available to certain
groups of people: those having contributed to the national
salvation, and those living in the highlands or certified as having
serious difficulties. Thus, only a limited number of persons can
enjoy State subsidies for medical care and the majority of the
country's 75 million people - most of them are farmers - must pay
doctor's bills. Generally, patients have to pay large fees for
special treatment; for instance, VND 1 million for a liter of blood
transfused during an operation. There are areas reserved for rich
patients in one hospital with good physicians and plenty of
medicines. Poorer patients receive little care at low cost or free
of charge.

From the economic viewpoint, this mode of treatment is fair since,
"the more you pay, the better service you get." This concept,
however, is not fair from a humane point of view so it was decided
to build hospitals for the poor. And the Health Ministry promised
that each hospital will have various forms of treatment but at
least 21% of the patients will be treated free of charge.

Vietnam's medical care must be improved both qualitatively and
quantitatively to meet the increasing demand of the population, the
great majority of which are poor. Since the gap between rich and
poor is widening, small groups of richer people can enjoy more
privileges while the poor especially those in the hinterlands and
the mountains suffer from lack of medical care.

Should medical care be commercialized?

Prof. Nguyen Nguyen Khoi, head of the Artificial Kidney Section,
Bach Mai Hospital remarked: "Medical care must have some economic
characteristics since all modern treatment is expensive and the
patient must pay for the amortization of equipment and materials
consumed. The hospital can recover the capital invested after five
years and the State no longer has to invest in it. However, not all
patients can afford such costly treatment. Therefore, we have to
consider some way to help those who cannot pay. Perhaps, a health
insurance policy is propitious, but it must be suitable to meet the
costs." Therefore, we still have to wait.

Vietnam: PM approves HCMC municipal development fund

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Prime Minister has approved a proposal to establish a municipal
development fund for HCMC submitted by the Ministry of Finance.

The fund is a State-owned financial entity with chartered capital
of VND500 billion, which will be mobilized from revenues from the
sales of State-owned houses, lotteries and land use, electricity
and water surcharges, telephone charges, local budget and
contributions and loans from local and foreign individuals.

The fund will make investments in socio-economic infrastructure
development projects in HCMC and engage in other operations such as
investment consulting services, equitization of State-owned
enterprises and stock exchange. Its lending rates will be set by
the HCMC People's Committee but they must not exceed the lending
rates for medium and long term loans stipulated by the State Bank.

The fund will enjoy tax reduction and exemption in accordance with
the law.

This year, HCMC expects to mobilize VND17,000-18,000 billion, up by
33.7-41% from 1995 and accounting for 36% of the local GDP. The
amount, to come from different sources, including the local budget,
land fund, bond sales, lottery revenues, foreign investment, loans
and foreign aid, will be used for socio-economic development,
especially infrastructure development, which is estimated at
VND3,500 billion. Key infrastructure projects include the Bac Nha
Be-Nam Binh Chanh Road, Nguyen Tri Phuong Bridge and Road, the road
from Ong Lanh Bridge to Hiep Phuoc Industrial Park, the belt
highway over Saigon River to Bac Nha Be-Nam Binh Chanh Road, the
north-south artery, Ton Duc Thang Road and Bridge, and industrial
parks such as Tan Thoi Hiep, Cu Chi and others.

Vietnam: Gov't takes strong measures against tax debtors

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The Prime Minister has issued an instructive allowing concerned
authorities to take strong measures to settle the import-export tax
arrears, which has seriously affected collections for the State
budget.

Instructive 575/TTg dated Aug.24 has assigned the General
Department of Customs and the Ministry of Finance to consider tax
exemption or reduction of fines for late payment of taxes for
businesses which have paid the taxes due before Sept.30, 1996.
Regarding tax debt incurred before April 1, 1992 which businesses
are unable to pay (due to dissolution, bankruptcy or losses), the
two authorities must investigate the situation and recommend to the
Government to cancel the debts.

Beginning October 1, 1996, the General Department of Customs will
coordinate with the Finance Ministry and the State Bank to deduct
the balance in the bank account of import-export businesses that
fail to pay overdue import-export taxes after Sept.30 or to seize
their goods for auctions to recover the overdue taxes.

In addition, long debtors of import-export taxes may be subject to
suspension of business licenses, and depending on the seriousness
of violations, may be fined or prosecuted for criminal
responsibility.

When Will Vietnam Have a Well-Built Generation?

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Investment in improving the health of school-age children is a big
concern of every country, with a view to bettering its people's
physical fitness, as well as to having stable human resources to
serve the country's development process. Here are excerpts from an
interview with Nguyen Vo Ky Anh, chief of the Physical Education
Department (the Ministry of Education and Training) concerning this
problem.

Compared with other regional countries, Vietnamese people are much
smaller, shorter and lighter. Could you tell us what will be the
physical fitness standard of Vietnamese in the future, specifically
to the year 2020?

As far as we are concerned, by the year 2000, Vietnamese should try
to reach the average height of 1.65m (for males) and 1.60 (for
females). During past years, the physical growth of Vietnamese has
been strongly affected by the results of a number of consecutive
wars and the country's underdeveloped economy, and thus physical
training has not been a concern. Another reason for the limited
physical development of the people has been low educational
standards and lifestyle; the people lack fundamental knowledge
about the preservation and improvement of their physical condition.
The current physical growth rate of the people has not improved
much in comparison with the year 1943.

In your opinion, in order to reach the above-mentioned standard,
what must we do in terms of physical education?

Initially, we have to educate people about nutrition. In elementary
schools, we plan to bring physical fitness education programs into
the teaching curriculum, and at the secondary level, knowledge of
health will be included in subjects such as biology and citizen
education. We will try our utmost to improve the quality of these
programs.

How about the current situation of the facilities of school yards
and exercise rooms, and the amount of time reserved for physical
education?

It is discouraging for the country's physical education that at the
moment, many schools do not have play yards and exercise rooms for
pupils. The present area of school yards has been increasingly
narrowed or a major part of it has been utilized for economic
activities, building restaurants, clubs and dance halls for
example. The Ordinance concerning the construction of schools with
pedagogical standards has not been properly implemented, so many
new schools are not built with school yards. In foreign countries,
schools must have stadiums and exercise facilities to make sure the
pupils' physical training is not interrupted, rain or shine.

Physical education is now compulsory in schools, with at least two
periods a week required for all levels of education. At the
university level, after four years, students must finish five
credits in physical education if they want to take graduation
exams; elementary and secondary pupils are required to complete at
least five credits.

Teachers play an important role in the improvement of the quality
of physical education. Could you tell us whether the staffs are
professionally qualified?

Only a minority of physical education teachers have been trained in
gymnastics and sports schools, the remainder are mostly graduates
of pedagogical colleges. For the time being, the country has two
centrally managed pedagogical schools--one in Hanoi and the other
in Ho Chi Minh City, three faculties for gymnastics training and
sports teachers at Vinh, Hue and Bac Thai pedagogical universities,
and 16 departments specializing in gymnastics and sports at local
colleges, plus a number of students at the Gymnastics and Sports
University. Every year, between 400 and 1,000 teachers graduate,
but this number fails to meet the current demand. On the contrary,
educational administrators still concentrate more on how to provide
pupils and students with adequate cultural knowledge rather than
physical education. As a result students and pupils may not have
good physical fitness and this is not being given proper attention.
At the elementary level, there are no gymnastics teachers available
since teachers have to cover the curriculum and extra-curricular
activities, and directly manage classes as well. So, it is evident
that right in the first years of school, our pupils are not given
systematic physical education. Gymnastics teachers are not only
unqualified but also there are not enough to meet the demand. On
the average, at all levels of education, one teacher has to cover
2,000 pupils; this ratio at the high school level is 1/300, and
1/200 at the tertiary level. We are now lacking 30,000 gymnastics
teachers.

How much is the annual funding the State offers for physical
education?

On the whole, this funding is too low, making up only a few percent
of that reserved for general training and education. In particular,
no funding of this kind is provided for the elementary education
level.

Pupils and students only have good intellect when they are in good
physical condition. We have developed a strategy for upgrading the
quality of physical education in schools at different levels to the
year 2005. We hope the State will consider it a target to be
urgently met, like many other targets and programs of the
educational sector.

Vietnam: Tales of Mollusks

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Tran Quang Thinh - HCMC

The meretrix, the oyster, the shell fish, and the corbicula were
perhaps well-known long ago but nowadays, not many people know
about these bivalve mollusks.

A businessman specializing in trading in specialty sea food shared
a thought-provoking story about the oc huong (a kind of winkle).
The oc huong, which can be found along the coast from Thanh Hoa to
Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan provinces, has a popular reputation,
especially for foreigners since its flesh is delicious and rich in
protein. Unfortunately, this kind of mollusk has been exploited
carelessly and uncontrollably on a large scale since 1992.
Admittedly, the purchase, processing and export of oc huong have
brought about practical economic changes creating more employment
for laborers but unfortunately, fishermen have been hunting the oc
huong excessively. Consequently, natural reserves of oc huong are
running out and there will not be any left in the future.

On a business trip not long ago to central Vietnam, the author had
a chance to hear about a kind of oyster named so long from a
colleague who disclosed that provincial authorities in Binh Thuan
had put a ban on catching this shellfish from now to July 31,1998.
This was an urgent solution to restore and maintain so long beds
along the coast, which were once considered the "richest mines of
so long's" in the entire country. Because of rash exploitation, the
so long has dropped in number and the supply has been exhausted.
The amount caught per year has decreased considerably: 25,000 tons
in 1993, 20,000 in 1994 and then 10,000 in 1995. Most were  young
oysters. Undoubtedly, the so long is still threatened with
extinction. Previously, authorities forbade exploiting a scallop
named diep in 1994 to 1995 to preserve this specialty.

These examples are not special cases. It seems that people are
always "good" at thoughtlessly depleting resources which appear to
be boundless.

Recently, an alarm was raised about a kind of shellfish named oc
gao in Tien Giang. The yield of oc gao caught this year plummeted
dramatically. There may be many causes but the most obvious is
overwhelming exploitation without planning or control. It is said
there might be a temporary prohibition on catching oc gao soon to
protect this breed, which means consumers will not have a chance to
taste oc gao.

"Will there be any chia voi (pipefish) in the future?" It is said
that if visitors come to Nha Be (a suburban district in Ho Chi Minh
City) and do not taste the specialty chia voi, it means that they
still have not set foot in Nha Be. Demand inevitably results in
supply so businesspeople and processors rushed to hunt for "chia
voi" to the extent that these fish now struggle to survive.

Not long ago the press, especially foreign newspapers, praised a
Vietnamese scientist and businessman for breeding seahorses, so now
demand for seahorses is extremely high. According  to a seahorse
trader whom we met on a recent trip to Nha Trang, about 20 million
seahorses are consumed worldwide every year. They are not "common"
fish. There is no fisherman specializing in catching them. We were
on a boat and its owner, a fisherman, told us sincerely: "Nowadays,
seahorses are becoming more scarce, they rarely run into our net.
It turns out they are becoming very valuable. When catching a
seahorse with its eggs, fishermen used to throw it back into the
sea." But now, hardly anyone will do that since the fish fetches an
excellent price on the market. The market, in turn, influences the
existence of seahorses and gradually, they are becoming extinct.
For that reason, the above-mentioned businessman and scientist in
Nha Trang has begun raising seahorses.

As another businessman told us: "Breeding seahorses is really a
profit-making business." Big profits can be gained artificially,
independent of nature and the seas. But if everyone could realize
this and everyone began raising these fish, what would
happen?

Vietnam: Where to Go for Weekends? Hanoi needs more entertainment venues

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Song Xanh

Along with economic growth, many visual changes have occurred in
Hanoi and other large cities. New houses and buildings have been
constructed and streets have been widened. Hanoians have adapted
themselves to the market economy but now find that they have
nowhere to go for entertainment on holidays or Sundays.

Parks in the past and in the present

Previously, one of the popular hobbies of Hanoians and visitors was
strolling in the park, especially on Sundays, holidays or during
festive occasions. Children and even adults used to amuse
themselves on seesaws, tumbling-boxes, slides and merry-go-rounds
in Thong Nhat Park, which was renamed Lenin Park. They could also
go to the Botanical Gardens or the Zoo to watch elephants chewing
sugar cane or hear the roar of tigers or lions. Now the
deterioration of the parks and the Zoo has resulted in a decreasing
number of visitors. In Lenin Park, some new game equipment has
replaced the old and the games are no longer free: visitors must
now pay to sit on the slow and obsolete planes going up and down,
in the crashing cars or in the train going around in circles. How
about the Zoo? "The animals look so thin, sick and sluggish.
Perhaps a lot have died because I saw many empty cages," a Zoo
visitor said. The green trees, calm lakes and pure air in the parks
are all strollers can enjoy after long hard working hours.

The Hanoi Park Bureau is in charge of flower gardens, street trees
and 47 parks in the city, including 50-hectare Lenin Park and
10-hectare Bach Thao Park which serve over one million residents.
"We cannot meet the entertainment demands of the people because the
Government pays hardly any attention to the problem," Do Duy Vuong,
vice-director of Hanoi Park Bureau said.

Cinemas turn to dance halls

Nearly half of the ten cinemas managed by Hanoi Film and Tape
Company have been converted into dance halls or restaurants. New
names such as Hollywood Club, Centropell, Metal and Com Vietnam Inn
have replaced Me Linh, Dai Dong, Kinh Do and Dang Dung cinemas. "It
is true that people do not want to go to the movies any more. So
cinemas will be converted into 'cultural centers,' including dance
halls, karaoke and video rooms," Nguyen Thi Lien, vice-director of
Hanoi Film and Tape Company declared. Only a few cinemas are still
operational. Thang Tam, the largest cinema in Hanoi consisting of
1,000 chairs, and Dan Chu Cinema can organize projections just
twice a day. "We sell only between 10 and 50 tickets for every
showing at Thang Tam. The reason is that movie-goers' taste has
changed but projection equipment hasn't," Lien added.

The pioneers in modern techniques are private cinemas, including
Fansland, a familiar venue for the youth in Hanoi, which was opened
only a few years ago. Fansland always offers viewers good films
with high quality at reasonable prices. Following Fansland's
success, Hanoi Film and Tape Company opened New Age, an
air-conditioned 100-seat cinema adjacent to Thang Tam Cinema. New
Age often attracts many viewers on the weekends.

At present a Disneyland for Hanoi may be a far-fetched dream.
However, projects to upgrade cinemas, set up new game equipment in
Lenin Park and construct cultural and sport centers and underwater
palaces are being considered. Hopefully, these projects will be
carried out in the near future so that on weekends or holidays
Hanoians or visitors won't scratch their heads asking each other,
"Where should we go?"

Prices at some entertainment venues in Hanoi

Cinemas:
Thang Tam: VND12,000/ticket
New Age: VND20,000/ticket
Fansland: VND12,000/ticket
Dan Chu: VND6,000 or 8,000/ticket

Dance halls:
Queen Bee (9 Lang Ha St.): US$5/ticket
Royal (Hang Tre St.): US$5/ticket
Hanoi Hotel (Giang Vo St.): US$6/ticket (women free)
VIP (Nguyen Du): US$4.5/ticket
Centropell (Hang Cot): US$5/ticket for men;
US$2.5/ticket for women
free on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays

Vietnam: Equity Definition

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

"...First, the general opinion about  "equity" in health care does
not mean "equalization," "being equal," or "equality". Equity means
that those who have more demands are to be given more care, those
who suffer more losses receive more attention; whereas, being equal
or equality means that everybody with more or less the same demands
is to be treated equally. In the first stage of the transitional
period, there cannot be absolute equality but steps must be taken
to realize social equity. Equity also implies that more priority
and consideration must be given to certain classes of people in the
society.

Second, equity must include personal needs for health care when one
suffers diseases or has health problems and the ability to pay.
Although both rich and poor have needs for health care, their
payment ability is quite different. Therefore, equity must
guarantee that everyone's demand for medical examination and
treatment is met. Referring to market economy or services or
purchasing power also means mentioning the ability to pay. At
present, part of the population is unable to pay but still has the
needs, so the public health sector and the Government must take
responsibility to satisfy the mini-mum need of the people for
health care. The general view on equity in diagnosing and curing
diseases mainly has to do with the needs, not the ability to pay.

Third, the poor and those who have made good contributions to the
country  often find it hard to pay. Since they have contributed and
sacrificed a lot on behalf of the nation, the society must
compensate for their losses--that's a return for gratitude, not
charity. For this reason, the Government and the public health
sector must give more consideration to these people to maintain
social equity.

Fourth, the view on equity in health care shows that the normal
citizens, the poor, and those who are good contributors to the
country are completely entitled to medical care, not that they beg
for merciful treatment, pity, compassion or favor. As the Law on
Health Care for the Population says, everybody is entitled to
medical care. The Government and the public health sector must
therefore socialize the activities concerning health care and
protection for the citizens. The conditions required for winning
social equity are that the Government must seriously consider
investment in the public health sector and must be able to
calculate prices of the public health services to give good
services without making a profit. The ability of people to pay for
public health services in the market economy depends upon the
purchasing power of each person and the prices. The Government must
not only know the cost and be able to calculate the prices for
services but must also offer certain kinds of medicine to patients
free of charge. The Government must incur some financial losses in
order to help the common people. Equity must be accompanied by
medical morals, requiring a high sense of responsibility of the
doctors toward their patients and the same treatment for both rich
and poor patients."

Vietnam: Reaching higher

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

A survey of 1,149 students of Hanoi Medical University, aged 17-24
(629 males and 520 females) shows that the height of students still
continues to increase after puberty in both sexes: males reach top
height at the age of 24 (164.29cm), and females at 21 (155.56cm).
There is a distinct increase compared with Vietnamese young people
of 10 years ago, and particularly 20 years ago; today's males'
heights have increased by 4.95cm while females' are taller by
5.46cm. However, surveys conducted in some localities also show
that pupils in municipalities and cities have better health than
those in the countryside, in particular, the number of pupils
feeling exhausted after a day at school makes up a high proportion
(1/3-1/4). In an urban district of HCMC, up to 25% of pupils have
bad health due to malnutrition.

Vietnamese Income Survey

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

By Tran Hung

Vietnam has maintained a high economic growth rate. However, what
is the average per-capita income in Vietnam at present and how does
the country's high economic growth affect workers' incomes?
In the first half of this year, the average monthly income per
capita of State sector workers was VND472,800 and gross domestic
product averaged US$516 per capita, according to statistics from
the Information Center under the Ministry of Planning and
Investment. Nevertheless, there was still a gap in earnings between
the central and local levels - VND616,000 and VND366,800
respectively.

The areas in which State workers were highest paid - over
VND800,000 per month - include electricity-water supply with
VND827,200, and post-communications and finance-banking with
VND814,100.

In the first six months of this year, the income discrepancy
between the central and local levels was broad in the three above
areas: VND900,000 compared with VND542,700 in the electricity-water
supply sector; VND900,000 with VND439,000 in the
post-communications sector, and VND820,000 with VND610,200 in
finance-banking.

Such industries as oil and coal followed with incomes averaging
VND799,300 per capita per month, in which the centrally governed
area attained VND850,000 and the locally governed, VND454,500. This
is paradoxical although oil and coal are Vietnam's key exports.

However, the income of workers at the central level was lower than
that at the local level in two of the 18 areas surveyed, namely
fisheries, VND301,000 compared with VND420,400, and
hotel-restaurant services, VND520,000 with VND616,600. Meanwhile,
the areas in which the monthly per-capita income was equal at both
levels included science (VND362,000) and health (VND350,000).

Alongside the scientific and health sectors, those working in
culture and sports also received a low monthly income, on average
VND347,000. The salary of those who work in the educational sector
were even lower in the 18 surveyed areas in the country, averaging
VND316,000 per capita, in which the income at the central level was
VND399,000 and that at the local level VND310,500.

The above figures are just references as are all statistics
released by the General Department of Statistics and the Ministry
of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs. At present, people
prefer working in such areas as trading, services, restaurants and
hotels.

The incomes of workers in the foreign-invested and private sectors
have not yet been surveyed; therefore, an overview of personal
income throughout the country has not been done. According to the
World Bank and United Nations Development Program, the annual
income in Vietnam is now US$700 per capita; particularly, Ba
Ria-Vung Tau Province has attained an average income of US$1,100,
Ho Chi Minh City US$1,000 and Hanoi US$800.

Vietnam: Gourds Reach Foreign Markets

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Environmentally-friendly luffas, which are often used for cleaning
saucepans by Vietnamese housewives, are now popular on the world
market for their newly-discovered uses.

By Pham Hong Van

It is surprising that Vietnamese luffas have appeared on the
counters of big supermarkets in Western Europe. In addition, they
are used as ornaments in restaurants, as bathing sponges instead of
brushes in hotels, and for physical therapy in hospitals.

The luffa products are produced in An Giang Province by two joint
ventures: An Giang Agro-Product and Foodstuff Import-Export Company
(AFIEX Co.) and International Foodstuff Company (IFC).

At present, farmers in An Giang are financed by AFIEX Co. to grow
gourds for fiber. The seeds are from the Philippines, and can be
harvested after three months with 15,000-20,000 gourds per hectare.
The gourd fruit can reach 0.8-1 meter long each but cultivation is
not simple: Farmers must be experienced in growing local gourds;
frames for the plant to climb must be well built; insecticides must
be applied during the flowering period and gourd plants should be
fertilized at least three times a month.

According to the Filipino agricultural experts who are guiding
farmers in An Giang, this kind of gourd is suited to the soil here.
If well-cultivated, it can be harvested three times a year with the
number of fruits beyond prediction. Over-three-kilo gourds are
soaked in water before their flesh is extracted. Then the luffas
must be dried in the shade (they can be broken if dried in
sunlight) for four days. After that they are brought to factories
to be whitened before processing into various products: ornaments
(luffas are cut into small pieces for artisans to assemble) or
bathing sponges in round, triangle or oval shapes or belt-shaped
for back rubbing or for dish-washing. Finished products are
exported to Western Europe at US$0.8-1.3/item, or higher according
to orders and are most popular with overseas Vietnamese, especially
in the U.S., Canada and Australia.

To date, more and more foreigners tend to use luffas because of the
current trend of using natural products to avoid skin allergies.

Big hotels in Ho Chi Minh City such as New World, Rex and Majestic
are using luffa products to replace brushes. Some Asian markets are
also interested in these products.

Currently, Tri Ton, Chau Phu, Cho Moi and Phu Chau districts of An
Giang Province are cultivating the Philippine gourd supplied by
AFIEX Co. Farmers are provided with seeds and fertilizers; when
harvested, a category one dry luffa with a minimum length of 0.8m
sells for VND3,000; category two at VND2,000 and category three at
VND1,000. Growers can earn VND15 million per hectare on average.

What has been done in An Giang so far is just a trial step. If all
goes well, gourds will be grown in many other provinces and the
value will increase.

Luffa, once used to wash pots and pans or dishes, is now diversely
used and is valuable on the world market. Doing business in the
time of market economy is full of interesting opportunities.

Vietnam: Stone Handicrafts on Show Abroad

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Tourists to the famous Ngu Hanh Mount, Quang Nam-Da Nang Province,
all like to buy Non Nuoc stone handicrafts as souvenirs.

By NGUYEN DINH LAC - HCMC

It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that a
village specializing in stone devices such as stone pestles,
mortars, and chopping blocks was formed at the foot of Ngu Hanh
Mount. The first copies of Cham statues carved of Non Nuoc stone
were made to meet some French orders. But to the year 1975, the
activities here had not developed with only some small villages
producing simple handicrafts such as stone ashtrays, mortars,
bracelets, and lion statues. However, since 1985, the shift of
local fishermen to this career has brought new beauty and style to
stone products. And since 1990, Non Nuoc handicrafts have found a
position on American, French, Canadian, and Hong Kong markets.
Graduating from an art course in the army in 1988, Nguyen Long Buu
is among the rare trained artists of the young generation in the
stone handicraft-making village. On his return after his military
service, he created many products just for fun until 1993 when his
piece Nguong Vong was bought for a high price by an Australian.

Since that turning point, Buu has shifted to making statues for
home and garden decoration and many of his products have been sold
to foreigners. In the last two years, Buu has been invited to build
monuments in Gia Lai, and Buon Ma Thuot. He is now preparing for an
exhibition in Singapore sponsored by the Happy Wear International
Co.Ltd (Taiwan). This is the first time Non Nuoc stone handicrafts
will appear in an international statue exhibition with 20 carvings
by Nguyen Long Buu; the shortest height is 0.30 meters, and the
highest 1.20 meters.

The long-nurtured dream of Buu now is to make a bust of Uncle Ho in
Pac Bo.

Vietnam: Dong or U.S. dollar?

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

I work for a foreign-invested company in Vung Tau. According to
Vietnamese labor regulations, the wage of an employee must be
specified in the labor contract. Should this wage be expressed in
U.S. dollars or Vietnamese dong? Does the law of Vietnam have any
articles dealing with this issue?

Le Duc Thuan - Vung Tau

According to Article 5 in Decree 197-CP dated December 31, 1994 of
the Government and Circular 11-LDTBXH/TT dated May 3, 1995, the
employer may choose the mode of payment to suit the labor
conditions and production activities of the enterprise, but this
choice must be expressed in the collective labor agreement and
labor contract. Wages paid to Vietnamese employees must be in
Vietnamese dong at the U.S. dollar exchange rate fixed by the State
Bank at the moment of payment.

Vietnam: Compensation for Labor Accidents

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The last sanction  for labor violations says, "Any employer who
fails to meet labor safety measures will be fined VND10 million."
In some cases, however, the violation can cause death for workers.
So is 10 million enough to warn any boss who knows this violation
quite well but ignores it and indirectly causes a casualty?

Truong Quang Hung - Qui Nhon

According to Article 11 in Government Decree 06/CP dated January
20, 1995, the employer must compensate the payment of at least 30
months' wages for employees who lose over 81% of their working
ability or for relatives of those who die of accidents. If
accidents are caused by employees' errors, they are also supported
by the employer with the payment of at least 12 months.

Vietnam: Largest shipbuilding JV licensed

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

The first and largest foreign-invested shipbuilding project in
Vietnam received a license from the MPI last week.

The Hyundai-Vinashin Co.Ltd. is a 30/70 JV between Vietnam
Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (Vinashin) and four companies
affiliated with Hyundai Corp. (South Korea) with a duration of 50
years. The first phase of the project, capitalized at US$95.4
million, involves building a shipbuilding factory in Ninh Phuoc
Commune, Ninh Hoa District, 55 km from Nha Trang City, which will
repair 100 ships of up to 120,000 tons and build five new ships of
up to 80,000 tons/year. In the second phase, US$300 million will be
invested in developing the Hyundai-Vietnam Industrial Complex to
produce steel, oil and gas exploitation facilities and diesel
engines.

Vinashin is seeking partners to repair and upgrade its shipyards in
order to increase the total capacity of the national fleet to 1.5
million tons by the year 2000. Established in January this year, it
is one of the largest companies of Vietnam's maritime industry with
22 affiliated units. Between now and 2010, the company will try to
modernize technology and build new ships of 10,000 tons, container
vessels and military ships and develop three shipbuilding centers
in Vietnam.

There are 60 ship repair and building factories in Vietnam but only
two can build ships of up to 15,000 tons, two others can build
ships of up to 3,000 tons and the remaining can repair and build
ships of under 1,000 tons.

According to the development plan for the shipping fleet to 2010,
Vietnam needs over US$500 million to increase the DWT of its
shipping fleet to one million tons by 2000, and US$3 billion to
reach the targets of 3.5 million tons by 2005 and six million tons
by 2010.

Vietnam: Privileges offered to workers in equitized SOEs

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

Workers in equitized enterprises can hold stakes equivalent to 25%
of the enterprise's assets, according to a circular on financial
issues, sales of shares and interests of workers in equitized State
enterprises.

Circular 50TC/TCDN issued by the Finance Ministry states that the
equitized State-owned enterprise (SOE) is allowed to offer 10% of
its asset value in shares to workers depending on seniority and
individual performance. The value of the shares for each worker
must not exceed six months' salaries. These shares are ordinary and
State-owned and the worker can enjoy dividends until the end of
his/her life.

The circular also states that the equitized enterprise can sell 15%
of the value of its assets in shares to workers on credit, but the
total value of these shares must not exceed the value of shares
bought in cash by the workers at the enterprise. Workers can enjoy
dividends of the shares bought on credit on a yearly basis, but
each year they must repay at least 20% of the value and 4% of the
interest on these shares. If they fail to pay the loans in two
consecutive years, they must return the shares to the State. Also,
they cannot inherit, sell or mortgage the shares if they have not
paid in full the amount owed.

In all, workers at equitized enterprises can hold shares equivalent
to 25% of the value of the assets of the enterprise. However, only
those who are on the payroll and work for over three years by the
time of equitization and will continue working thereafter can enjoy
these privileges.

The equitized enterprise can only sell shares after competent
authorities have appraised its assets and determined the value of
the assets allowed to be sold or the funds to be mobilized. Also,
it must announce at least three times on the mass media the total
value of assets, the amount of shares to be sold, those allowed to
buy shares, time of issue and profit margin of the three previous
years.

Recently, Minister and Director of the Central Steering Committee
for Equitization Phan Van Tiem signed Decision 01/CPH on the
procedure to turn SOEs into joint stock companies. Accordingly,
there are four steps for SOEs to proceed in turning into joint
stock companies: Preparation for equitization, drafting the
equitization plan, approval and development of the plan, and
inauguration of the joint stock company and business registration.

Equitized SOEs are divided into two categories: Those with capital
of over VND3 billion and those with capital under VND3 billion. The
equitization board of the SOE must publicly announce the financial
standing of the enterprise before proceeding with equitization and
the sales of shares as well as the organization of registration for
share buyers.

In the two years of 1996 and 1997, the Government expects to
equitize 150 State enterprises, of which each ministry, province or
city will have 2-4 enterprises to be equitized, and to sell shares
of State enterprises to foreign buyers on a pilot basis.

Vietnam: The Path of AIDS

from THE SAIGON TIMES MAGAZINE, September 20, 1996

In December 1990, the intelligentsia in Ho Chi Minh City was
stirred by the first detection of an HIV-positive case in Vietnam.
A Vietnamese girl residing in the city tested positive with the HIV
in her blood when she took a health examination to go abroad with
her fiance.

By Thuc Doan - HCMC

More than five years have passed. People have forgotten the story
but the girl has to work and live day and night haunted by the
virus that causes AIDS.

In 1990 and 1991, only one HIV-infected case was found. The next
year, 1992, twelve cases were detected, but in 1993 the number of
patients soared to 1,000 nationwide. Over the past three years, the
HIV virus has taken the lives of 329 Vietnamese.

A source from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee indicated that,
as of Sept. 7,1995, the number of virus-infected cases reached
4,316 including 80 foreigners and 4,239 locals. Of them, 508 people
have been diagnosed as AIDS patients.

Meanwhile, to August 30, results from the program on epidemic
control showed that the southern cities and provinces account for
3,516 HIV-infected cases, with 1,741 cases detected in HCM City.

According to Mr. Dang Van Khoat, chief of the Information Center of
the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee, AIDS in Vietnam is
developing more slowly than in other Asian nations. "AIDS has not
yet knocked at every door as seen in some parts of the world,"
Khoat said.

Officials from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee said that
although the number of HIV-infected cases in the country is not
high compared with other countries in the Asian region, the virus
has became dangerous to Vietnamese people. The available figures do
not reveal exactly the number of HIV-infected people in the
country, according to an AIDS expert. "They are just statistics
from the annual result of the program on epidemic control and test
results from blood-donors," he said.

Dr. Le Hoang Son of the HCMC AIDS Prevention Committee said that
the number of HIV-infected people in HCMC could reach an alarming
20,000 case-mark if comprehensive tests are available to the city's
population. "The infection rate of HIV-virus varies by social
class," Son said. To date, in Southern cities and provinces, 18
pregnant women, four children and 116 normal citizens who do not
belong to the high-risk groups are HIV patients.

At first, the increase of HIV-infected cases was mainly among drug
addicts. However, in recent years, the number of people infected
with the virus due to sexuality has doubled annually. According to
statistics from the HCMC AIDS Prevention Committee, the ratio of
HIV-infected cases of prostitutes was 0.47% in 1993, 0.62% in 1994,
1.07% in 1995 and up to 1.17% in the first six months of 1996. As
of August 30, there were 242 HIV-infected prostitutes in southern
provinces, 6.72% of the total cases.

Experts from the AIDS Prevention Committee said that Vietnam is now
where Thailand was seven years ago. The country is facing on AIDS
threat as the number of AIDS-related deaths grows significantly
although the Government has spent large sums on AIDS prevention
programs implemented since 1990. In HCMC, the local budget earmarks
over VND 3 billion for AIDS prevention operations every year.

HIV-Infected patients' lives

The world's most famous HIV patient, basketball superstar Magic
Johnson, made a comeback after announcing in 1991 that he was
retiring from basketball because he was infected with HIV.
Meanwhile, he isn't waiting for a cure, he's too busy living. In
most cases, Vietnamese HIV patients are not so fortunate as
Johnson. They often live all day long haunted by the HIV without
love from their families. Some patients show resentment against the
virus which "sows" its "dead seedling." Their fights against this
deadly disease are courageous as they understand that Vietnam
cannot afford to import expensive drugs to help AIDS patients live
longer. Overcoming the fear, HIV patients have gathered together to
establish a "friends help friends" group. The group belongs to the
HCMC Health Center and operates with the purpose "building good
relationships among HIV-infected patients who need sympathies from
others."

The "Friends Help Friends" group has 70 volunteers to care for AIDS
patients under treatment at Binh Trieu Hospital. Phung, a member of
the group said, "I help these patients because I need love and
sympathy from society. I wish my remaining days to be
meaningful."

At present, many clubs of HIV-infected patients have been
established in the country as well. AIDS patients come together
because they don't want to be overwhelmed by loneliness.
