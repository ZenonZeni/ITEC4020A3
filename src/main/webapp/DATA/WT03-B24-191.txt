<B>Technology Overview:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Biomedical Group that is one of diversified operations of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. has been a leading supplier, distributer and manufacture of research products since the first product release of restriction enzyme to the market in 1979, and has kept the top share of domestic market of reagents for use in genetic engineering research. Its success in commercializaion of research use reagents for cell biology and glycobiology, immunology as well as genetic engineering and molecular biology has promoted further expansion of product lines into instrumentation, which consequently has rendered Takara as comprehensive supplier in the biotech-research supporting industry. Another field the biomedical Group has pursued is Diagnostic Reagents and Pharmaceuticals. By capitalizing on our R & D achievement in biotechnology, recent progresses have born the fruits: They are, for example, a new anti-fungal agent R106  that was licensed out to a few pharmaceutical establishments both in Japan and overseas, and an immunosoppressant Deoxyspergualin that was on market. The joint development program of IgA Nephropathy treatment and Ex vivo Cellular Therapy for cancer are in progress.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
