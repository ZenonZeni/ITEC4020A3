<H2><CENTER>Cannabis use found to increase frequency of relapse in patients
with schizophrenia </CENTER>
</H2>
The literature examining the relationship between marijuana use and schizophrenic
symptoms among patients with schizophrenic disorders has been conflicting.
The purpose of this study by Linzen et al (Archives General Psychiatry,
Vol. 51, pg. 273-279, 1994), was to compare cannabis-using schizophrenic
patients with schizophrenic non-users. There were 11 mild and 13 heavy cannabis
users compared to 69 non-users in a prospective study which lasted one year.
The authors found that significantly more and earlier psychotic relapses
occurred in the cannabis-using group, particularly as use increased. No
other factors could be found to explain this including other street drugs.
<BR>
<BR>
Fourteen of the cannabis-using patients, who were experiencing clinical
remission from their schizophrenia, reported an immediate increase in psychiatric
symptoms after using cannabis again. <BR>
<BR>
In all but one of the patients cannabis use also preceded the onset of their
first psychotic symptom. Over the one-year period only 20 percent of the
non-using subjects had a psychotic relapse, as compared to 46 percent for
those who used cannabis . <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This study helps to clarify the relationship
between cannabis use and schizophrenia. While studies such as this cannot
prove cause-and-effect relationships, it is clear that use of cannabis can
cause patients with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, to have
more frequent relapse of symptoms compared to non-users of cannabis. An
important feature of this study was that the groups were matched for variables,
such as the use of other street drugs or alcohol, making these factors not
relevant in interpretation of the results. Findings of this study are consistent
with the observations of prior studies showing that cannabis use prior to
illness was an independent risk factor for schizophrenic symptoms. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Smoking Tobacco or Marijuana Reduces Antioxidant Levels in HlV-lnfected
Patients </CENTER>
</H2>
Miguez-Verbano and colleagues from the University of Miami School of Medicine
reported at the American College of Clinical Pharmacology meeting in 1994
that anti-oxidant status was negatively impacted in 60 non-symptomatic HlV-infected
marijuana smokers. <BR>
<BR>
Vitamin E levels were significantly lower in marijuana users, as well as
cigarette smokers, compared to non-smoking HIV infected subjects. Subjects
who used both tobacco and marijuana exhibited frank vitamin E deficiency,
although vitamin E intake did not differ significantly among the groups.
<BR>
<BR>
These findings show that marijuana and tobacco smoking have a detrimental
effect on vitamin E status of HlV-infected individuals. This is of concern
in light of the important role of vitamin E in immune processes, including
inhibition of viral activation. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This well done study shows further evidence
that smoking marijuana contributes to defects in the immune system. The
issue of smoking marijuana for an HlV-infected patient makes absolutely
no sense in terms of preserving immune function to fight the virus that
causes the disease. Antioxidant levels also have an important effect on
preventing cardiovascular disease and cancer, both of which would be important
in HlV-infected individuals. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Study examines the use of psychoactive and addictive drugs by
physicians </CENTER>
</H2>
Lutsky et al studied the current use of psychoactive drugs of abuse by physicians
specializing in medicine, surgery, and anesthesia, all of whom had trained
at the same academic institution. (Canadian Journal of Anaesthesia 1994/41:7/pp561-7)
1624 questionnaires were sent with a response rate of 58 percent. <BR>
<BR>
Difference in impairment rate among the physicians was not significant:
in surgery 14 percent, medicine 20 percent, and anesthesia 17 percent. Substance
abuse was clearly associated with a family history of substance abuse. Increased
stress at various career stages did not appear to increase substance abuse.
Substances most frequently abused were marijuana 55 percent, amphetamines
33 percent, and benzodiazepines 25 percent. <BR>
<BR>
A number of respondants reported that the use of alcohol and drugs by faculty
role models during their medical training was an important part of their
own personal use. Drug counseling programs and diversion programs were judged
inadequate by most respondents. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> No subset of society is immune from substance
abuse in a modern social context. Obviously, better detection and treatment
programs are necessary for the prevention and control of this problem, which
impairs medical judgment and places patients interests at great risk. <BR>
<BR>
In the United States, only 3 percent of practicing physicians are anesthesiologists,
yet 13 percent of physicians being treated for drug dependency are anesthesiologists,
presumably because of the ease of access to these substances in this medical
specialty. <BR>
<BR>
The data from this survey pointed out that most drug use started prior to
entry into medical school. The authors suggested that programs aimed at
deterrents failed at least partially because there are no universally acceptable
drug screening methods, and because penalties for drug use are insufficiently
severe. Substance abuse by faculty represented another setback to any prospect
for deterring physicians in training. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Study shows two marijuana cigarettes as harmful as 28 of tobacco.
</CENTER>
</H2>
This study by Starr et al followed 25 non-tobacco smoking surfers, in excellent
physical condition, who smoked an average of two marijuana joints per day.
The control was 25 male urban smokers from the San Francisco area and 25
non-smoking male Mormons from the Silicon Valley area. Damage and irritation
to the lung cells of the marijuana smokers was comparable to those who smoked
a mean of 28 tobacco cigarettes per day. (Medical Tribune, page 17,1994)
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> Tobacco smoke is the most widespread factor
associated with premature death due to cancer and cardiovascular disease
in the USA. This study shows that cellular damage to the lungs produced
by daily use of two marijuana cigarettes is similar to that seen in those
who smoke nearly a pack and a half of tobacco cigarettes a day. <BR>
