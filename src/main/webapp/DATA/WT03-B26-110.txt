<H3>Dividing Up The Continent </H3>
<HR>

<P>
A moment's reflection on the nature and distribution of landcover
and its potential disturbance across the continent will result
in the simple conclusion that not all disturbance factors are
everywhere equally important. The most intensive landuses are
located in the south of the continent: those in the centre and
north of the continent are extensive rather than intensive.
<P>
Therefore, to achieve the greatest sensitivity in assessment,
it was necessary to stratify the continent into regions based
on the importance of one or more disturbance factors. Then, based
on this stratification, the quantification stage using satellite
image data can be customised to maximise the detection of the
landcover disturbance characteristic of that particular landuse
type.<HR>

<H4>Landuse Zones - Intensive And Extensive </H4>

<P>
The most severe and extensive disturbance to landcover has been,
and remains that provided by landuse: the direct result of human
activities.
<P>
By comparison, the perturbations generated by climate and weather
are either so gradual to be imperceptible even over centuries
(climate), or rapid but very localised in occurrence (weather
- storms, etc.). In contrast, the agents of ancient and modern
landuse, fire and mechanical or chemical clearing, are far more
influential.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
There seems little doubt that Aboriginal Australians significantly
disturbed the landcover (and the fauna) of the continent through
their use of fire throughout the millennia of their occupation
of this continent. They shaped the face of much of Australia in
a way that was separable from the very large climatic changes
of the last 30, 000 years; see <A HREF="refs.htm">Pyne (1991)</A>.

<P>
<I>The landcover consequences of an early Dry Season burn in a
northern Australian savanna. Fire is a landuse tool with poorly
understood long-term consequences for biodiversity; millennia
of its application by Aboriginal Australians notwithstanding.</I>
<HR>

<P>
There is no doubt that in the last two centuries European Australians
have also changed the landcover of the continent, both extensively
and substantially through agricultural and pastoral landuse. Therefore,
we primarily stratified the continent by landuse. Because we were
interested only in the landcover consequences of landuse, we used
a simple two-level stratification.
<P>
The first and most important decision was which landcover consequence
of landuse is the most significant disturbance for biotic erosion?
That we took to be habitat destruction by the clearing of natural
vegetation and its replacement by crops and pastures; eg see reviews
by <A HREF="refs.htm">Caughley (1994), Noble et al (in preparation), Saunders et al (in preparation)</A>.
<P>
As a consequence, the principal stratification of the continent
was based on the location of clearing; where clearing of native
vegetation for replacement with (exotic) crops, pasture and forest
vegetation has been and remains the principal disturbance. Within
this area of the continent, the impact of landuse on landcover
is principally one of replacement. The consequences for the biodiversity
that was originally characteristic of the native vegetation are
obvious and severe.
<P>
Much, but certainly not all, of the biotic erosion of the last
two centuries was concentrated in the areas of replacement landuse.
It follows then that the continued expansion of this landuse offers
the largest threat of accelerating biotic erosion; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Saunders et al (1994); Hobbs and Saunders (1994)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0511_048.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0511_048.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>Urbanisation and mining, like agriculture, are also replacement
landuse types. On a continental scale, the direct landuse consequences
of mining are trivial and not considered in this study. While
urbanisation is perhaps a hundred-fold more extensive than mining,
its direct landcover consequences are also not significant on
a continental scale. However, the indirect influence of urbanisation
on landcover change is substantial. Urban populations are growing
and need to be fed and clothed. Urban political values concerning
the conservation of biodiversity are also changing.</I><HR>

<P>
The dividing lines between the areas of the continent where landcover
clearing was the most significant disturbance factor were drawn
after searching the satellite image data by eye. Expert interpretation,
rather than machine decision, was used because in the detection
of the irregular and diffuse boundaries of clearing, the former
cannot yet be matched by the latter.
<P>
The boundary was finalised by allowing a generous geographic margin
beyond the edge of the clearing, approximately 100 km, and aligning
it with the national grid of the 1:250,000 scale topographic map
sheet series. Using this criterion, the continent was divided
roughly into one third and two thirds as in <A HREF="#table1">Table 1</A>.

<I>Stratification of the continent by the landcover consequence
of landuse. The outermost region (red) encompasses those areas
where the principal landcover disturbance threat was clearing
for crops, pastures and forests. However, not all of this area
was cleared. In the innermost region (green), the principal landcover
disturbance results from grazing and burning.</I><HR>

<HR>

<P>
We emphasise that this division was not based on the area actually
cleared for agriculture. Rather it was based on the threat of
clearing, both actual and potential. Therefore, we have not used
the obvious names of cleared and uncleared for fear of generating
misunderstanding.
<P>
Rather, we have coined the names Extensive Landuse Zone (ELZ)
for the central core of the continent and Intensive Landuse Zone
(ILZ) for the remaining coastal strips. As defined and illustrated
above, the Intensive Landuse Zone is approximately 39% (2, 984,
000 km2) of the continent and contains perhaps more than 90% of
the national population. In contrast, the Extensive Landuse Zone
is almost twice as large, 4, 708, 000 km2 in size (61%) but carries
as little as 5% of the national population.
<P>
Not all the ELZ is used on a permanent basis. Within this area
of the continent, the most common landuse is extensive pastoralism
that in terms of landcover consequences is a harvesting landuse.
Like forestry based on native forests and woodlands, it is notionally
sustainable where the offtake is small and irregularly patterned
in time and space. Nonetheless, most surveys of the impact of
extensive pastoralism, past and present, show that considerable
landcover change has occurred and because of it, or at least in
synergy with the arrival of domestic stock and establishment of
feral animals initially released in the ILZ, substantial biotic
erosion has occurred also; <A HREF="refs.htm">James et al (In Press), Newsome (1994), Pickard (1994)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0149_093.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0149_093.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
Besides extensive pastoralism, there are two other landuses within
the Extensive Landuse Zone; Traditional Use and Unused.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_024.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_024.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
These are Aboriginal Australians on Aboriginal land. They are
Traditional Owners but this is not Traditional Landuse.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1865_033.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1865_033.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
Unused land, or unallocated crown land, most of it in Western
Australia, is not completely without the impact of human activity
but here it is patchy and episodic.<HR>

<P>
For the landuses of Traditional and Unused, it was difficult,
for understandable reasons, to assess the level of landcover disturbance
using satellite data. The partitioning and distribution of finer
divisions of landuse within the Intensive and Extensive Landuse
Zones is discussed in <A HREF="chap2c.htm">Adding What Is Known</A>.
<HR>

<H4>Landcover Type </H4>
<HR>

<P>
A second and independent stratification of the continent was needed
by which to aggregate the detected landcover disturbance.
<P>
The type of stratification chosen was largely determined by the
purpose and scale of the analysis. Possible choices for the basic
area unit (strata) could be the (relatively) small area of a farm
or a local government area (LGA), or the much larger area of a
state, if the purpose of the analysis was landcover management
responsibility. However, in this study the principal focus is
biodiversity.
<P>
Therefore, an ecologically relevant stratification has been used.
As argued earlier, with a continental perspective, issues of scale
and ecological understanding decide that the most relevant stratification
was by landcover types; ie a typology based on vegetation and
soil attributes.
<P>
The task of deriving a tractable set of consistently defined,
landcover types was difficult. Considerable effort was made to
evaluate a wide range of alternatives. The final choice was based
on two simple and pragmatic reasons. Because the objective of
the project was to quantify landcover disturbance, the basic stratification
should be on landcover attributes; ie vegetation and soil variables.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0152_026.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0152_026.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Continental datasets of vegetation structural type exist, eg <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>,
as does one for soils, <A HREF="refs.htm">Northcote et al (1975)</A>.
Because attempts to reconcile and integrate these two datasets
were unsuccessful, the dataset of Natural Vegetation, <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>,
became the source typology for landcover.
<P>
It was assumed that considerable climate, soil and topographic
information was implicit in this continentally consistent mapping
of vegetation at landscape scales. Use of this dataset was not
without difficulty and error. Nonetheless, the dataset Natural
Vegetation, the vegetation as of 1788, was taken to be the basic
ecological divisions of the continent.
<P>
Two conditions on the use of the Natural Vegetation dataset were
noted. The first was that it was taken to be the truth: the boundaries
and descriptions of its 230 categories were not disputed even
though they occasionally appeared to be doubtful. The second was
that the large number of primary categories of Natural Vegetation
was reduced to a smaller set (34) by concentrating on overstorey
structural and floristic attributes (height, cover, genus), and
ignoring the understorey. Pragmatic reasons required that all
overstorey genera other than Eucalyptus and Acacia be pooled,
and within these three genera, the tall (T), medium (M), and low
(L) height categories also be pooled; <B>Table 2</B>. The nomenclature
was derived from that used in <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>.
