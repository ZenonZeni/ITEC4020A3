China: Chemical industry shows off

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5

THE latest chemical industry products, equipment and technology are on
show and investment co-operation is being sought at an international
industry fair which opened in Beijing yesterday.

"Current development has already been restricted by problems in funds
and technology, which indicates we must continue to firmly implement
the policy of opening up to the outside world, and fully use the
resources, funds and markets available both at home and abroad," said
He Guoqiang, vice-minister of chemical industry at the fair's
opening.

According to He, the fair, which runs from September 23 to 27 in the
China International Exhibition Centre, has so far drawn 95 overseas
chemical industry enterprises from 20 countries and regions, as well
as about 2,000 domestic enterprises.

Domestic participants are profiling about 120 projects for
co-operation and highlighting nearly 160 types of technology and
equipment for export.

"I am very happy to see there are new trends in co-operation between
foreign chemical circles and China's chemical industry over the last
couple of years," He said.

He cited four obvious changes, including the shifts: from simple
import of technology to all-round co-operation in scientific
research, production, personnel training and environmental
protection; from investments in individual projects to participation
in regional development of economic zones; from small projects to
those on a larger scale with a substantial amount of investment and
high technology content; and from co-operation with only a few large
companies to co-operation including medium and small-sized
enterprises.

In the ongoing Ninth Five-Year Plan, the industry will stress three
priorities: agrochemicals, such as fertilizer and pesticides, will be
further developed to meet the growing demands of agricultural
production; the petrochemical industry will be vigorously developed
by accelerating the production of organic raw materials, organic
intermediates, synthetic materials and fine and specialty chemicals
to support other pillar industries like the mechanical, electronic,
automobile manufacturing and building industries; and production of
high-tech and high value-added products will be expanded.

China: Scientists to document earliest dynasties

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 9

EDITOR'S note:

Starting this year, a State project to determine the chronology of
early Chinese history in the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties will be
carried out by the country's top historians and scientists. The
project, which is meant to give a clear, coherent picture of China's
beginnings, is the first of its kind supported by the government. It
is also considered an unprecedented co-operative effort between two
fields -- science and history.

Feature writers of China Daily have talked with the project's
initiator, State Councillor Song Jian, as well as project leader Li
Xueqin, archaeologist Li Boqian, astronomer Zhang Peiyu, Chinese
language professor Qiu Xigui and other scientists concerned. The
following is a series of articles on the interviews in today's and
tomorrow's page 9.

By Li Xing and Gong Qian

CHINA'S top historians and scientists will put their heads together to
develop a cohesive chronology of early Chinese history.

The project, which will be concluded in about three years, is intended
to create a dynasty outline dating to the Xia and early Shang eras,
noting the dates of each king's reign from Shang to Zhou dynasties.

The project is the brainchild of State Councillor Song Jian, a
scientist who specializes in astronautics and system control.

"We work together and apply modern science to the study of history,
provide convincing scientific bases, and give a more clear history to
our children," he said.

The project faces several hurdles because of differing historical
views.

For example, some ancient documents cite the 21st century BC as the
origin of Chinese history. But the documents don't corroborate with
archaeological and scientific evidence.

Furthermore, some early 20th century accounts may have been distorted
by revolutionary views that often discounted traditional ideas. For
decades, individual historians clung to their own views and couldn't
agree on early history.

But Song is determined to sort it out.

"We can't go on saying that we have a 5,000-year-old history while
denying its existence," he said.

Similar efforts to substantiate history have been successful elsewhere
in the world, so Song believes his project is possible.

He developed the idea after a trip to Egypt two years ago, when he
visited an ancient papyrus mill and marveled at the Rosetta Stone,
which bears the decree of an Egyptian king in hieroglyphics. He was
impressed by the sophistication of Egyptian studies, the result of
concerted research by Egyptian and European scholars.

When Song returned to China, he sent his opinions to historians and
archaeologists and found that some of them agreed with him.

Among them was archaeologist Kwang-chih Chang. He responded that no
single scholar was capable of such a big project, but that it could
be accomplished through teamwork and strong leadership.

Too often, Chinese scholars have concentrated on an obscure area or
specific subject. While the practice produced endless details, it did
little to give a complete portrayal of Chinese history.

Song believed historians could apply the same methods used by
scientists who measure geological time. He suggested that historians
specializing in the same time periods should join together to discuss
divisions in that era. The results of their consensus would then be
published as a reference document, which could later be revised.

"It's like building a basic co-ordinate," Song said. "To ascertain a
king's rule ended in this year or the next has little significance,
but obvious events that reflect political or dynastic changes must be
in accord."

Most experts welcomed the idea, but a few have reservations. Song
believes that their different recommendations are valid, but that the
application of modern science must take precedence.

With the rise of modern astronomy, which can reconstruct ancient
celestial phenomena, and the use of advanced dating techniques, Song
believes the two fields should be combined to study history.

He also sees great potential in archaeological work. Unfortunately,
Chinese houses and tombs, made from earth and wood, often failed to
endure harsh weather and time.

Despite the project's intimidating scale, Song is confident.

"With more money flowing into field work and research, I believe it
will bear some result," he said.

Song also believes the project can help boost the nation's morale.

"Respect for our national culture is crucial to the country's
progress," he said. "In this respect, historians should be the first
to do their part."

China: Uncovering the start of history

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 9

MODERN archaeology has helped push back the earliest known dates in
Chinese history at least 1,000 years by authenticating the existence
of the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century BC) through the discoveries
of its capitals below modern Zhengzhou and Anyang.

Will archaeologists create history again in a huge chronology project?

Archaeologist Li Boqian, one of the leading experts working on the
project, believes the evidence points to an even earlier starting
point for Chinese civilization, but says that this will be hard to
prove.

Before modern archaeology was introduced to China, historians based
their theories on such ancient books as "Records of the Historian"
written by Sima Qian and "the Bamboo Annal." These texts suggest
Chinese history begins with a dynasty called Xia, which dates back to
the 21st century BC.

But here lies the snag: there is no evidence of this ancient kingdom.

If Xia ever had a written language, no traces of it have been found.
Virtually everything that scholars know about them is based on the
ancient books.

It is therefore not surprising that while experts have plenty of
theories about the origins of the Xia, few are universally accepted.

From early this century, a group of scholars began to attack the
authenticity of these written records, dismissing them as mere
legends. Some even regard the investigation of the dynasty as a waste
of time.

As this view gradually came to prevail, the more cautious experts have
pushed back their estimates of the beginning of China's social
history by more than 1,000 years.

Then, in the early part of this century, the increasing use of
archaeological techniques located the Shang capital in Anyang in
Central China's Henan Province. This proved that what the books say
about this dynasty is largely true. Pictograms inscribed on cattle
bones and tortoise shells found in Anyang provide firmer proof.

The discovery once again raised hopes in the minds of some historians
that the account of the Xia given by the "Records of the Historian"
may also have some truth in it.

Artifacts and images have been found which are sufficiently older, and
markedly different from those of later civilization. For instance,
the earliest Chinese cooking utensils were jars or ding -- cooking
vessels with two loop handles and three legs. Shang people used li
(cooking tripods with hollow legs) and yan (steamers with a bowl-like
upper part and a ding-tripod lower part).

These objects came from a series of ancient sites found since the
1950s. Known as the Erlitou sites, they are scattered across central
and western Henan and northwest Shanxi, on the fertile plains
overlooking the Luohe River and Yihe River -- exactly where the Xia
people lived according to the old books. Carbon-14 techniques date
the Erlitou culture as existing between the 21st century BC and the
17th century BC.

Two large excavations in the '60s and '70s resulted in the discovery
of a palace foundation.

A rammed earth base, 80 centimetres thick, and remains of walls and a
colonnade have been identified. The whole structure and layout
prefigures the structure of later Chinese palaces. The scale and
complexity of the engineering would demand a large group of people
under rulers able to direct the labour project -- probably a state.

"Understanding the Erlitou culture is the key to the chronology of the
Xia," said Li Boqian. "Most experts now tend to believe Erlitou
culture belongs to the late Xia Dynasty."

Li said that even if the Xia language has not been unearthed, there
are other elements that might well prove the existence of the Xia
Dynasty. Archaeologists will take samples from the different stages
of the Erlitou excavation and compare them with samples from the same
time-band elsewhere.

"The results may not be final, but they are certain to be more
unanimous," said Li.

The beginning of the Xia kingdom -- if it existed -- is even more
elusive than its end. Some scholars believe it shows affinity with
the older neolithic Longshan culture, a culture characterized by
black pottery dating between 3000-2000 BC.

Archaeologists have found Longshan household objects, such as pottery
wine cups and a kitchen range buried in big tombs and walled cities.

Longshan rulers turned to priest-advisers for predictions on
government matters and the outcome of hunts and battles. The priests
applied red-hot rods to the bones of cattle until they cracked, then
interpreted the cracks as auguries from the spirits.

Some of the symbols found on the pottery have caused argument among
scholars. Some believe they are artistic designs, others take them as
early pictograms.

"They are not decorative designs, for sure," said Li. "It's only that
there are not enough of them for us to decipher them and understand
their meaning."

Another fact may help to pinpoint the early Xia. Historical records
have it that the third king of the Xia, Zhong Kang, was once unseated
from the throne by a leader called Hou Yi from Shandong in East
China. Archaeologists believe that this important political event
would certainly leave its traces. If any evidence of the invasion
from the east can be unearthed, it will help sketch the early period
of the Xia.

Much will depend on co-operation across academic disciplines. For
example, a solar eclipse was said to have occurred during the reign
of Zhong Kang. If astronomers could give comparable dates, it would
assist the archaeologists.

Compared with the Xia, archaeological discoveries about the Shang are
a lot richer. More than 10,000 tombs have been found so far.

Originally, the Shang kingdom was thought to extend over the wide
plain formed by the Yellow River. They seemed to be militarily strong
and to have a cruel caste hierarchy. Their bronzework shows they were
highly artistic.

But discoveries in recent decades may rewrite the features of the
Shang. The sites in East China's Jiangxi Province and Southwest
China's Sichuan Province are especially fascinating for
archaeologists. The artifacts unearthed there demonstrate the
sophisticated level Shang society had attained. The influence of
Shang culture may have extended as far as Viet Nam.

"These archaeological finds really make us reassess the level of the
social development the Shang reached," said Li Xueqin, director of
the History Department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

At the heart of the attempt to untangle the chronology of the Xia,
Shang and Zhou dynasties is the uncertainty about when the Shang
ended. It is known that the Zhou King Wu annexed the lands of the
last king of Shang and extended his own dominion. There are currently
about 30 different opinions about when this happened.

Li Boqian said the question will be solved largely through the joint
efforts of astronomers, historians and scientists. In fact, the whole
project depends upon co-operation between scientists, he said.

China: Poverty relief high on Party's agenda

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 1

THE Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee and the State
Council are determined to keep every Chinese adequately provided with
food and clothing by the end of this century.

"This target is unchangeable," Jiang Zemin, general secretary of CPC,
pledged yesterday at a national conference on poverty alleviation.

Premier Li Peng told conference participants that the country's poor
areas should list poverty relief high on their economic development
plan, and assign the task of providing enough food and clothes to the
masses as the first priority.

Presiding over yesterday's conference was Zhu Rongji, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and the vice-premier of the State Council.

Participants included high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Hu
Jintao, Ding Guangen, Wu Bangguo, Zou Jiahua, Jiang Chunyun and major
cadres from the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.

The CPC Central Committee and the State Council called upon the Party
to unite and mobilize all Chinese people to work for the common goal
in eliminating poverty in this country, Jiang declared.

From 1978 to 1995, China successfully reduced the country's
poverty-stricken population from 250 million to 65 million.

However, Jiang said, the task remains arduous and time is pressing for
realizing the goal of providing food and clothing for all poor people
in China by the year 2000.

"The CPC Central Committee is determined to win the hard battle,"
Jiang said.

Speeding up the development of poverty-stricken regions is not only an
economic issue, but also an issue concerning sustained national
stability, Jiang pointed out.

He said that with hard work, the goal can be achieved, because the
Party and the government pay paramount attention to poverty
alleviation and have adopted a series of major policies.

He suggested that a combination of State support and the development
of local resources is the basic solution for overcoming poverty.

He urged people in the poverty-stricken areas to pay more attention to
grain production, and to take advantage of local resources to develop
diversified operations that would increase the income of farmers.

Jiang also called for greater efforts to mobilize resources of the
whole society in the move to wipe out poverty.

China: Jiang hails relations with Kiribati

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 1

ALL countries of the world, regardless of size, should enjoy equal
political status, President Jiang Zemin said yesterday, when he met
with his Kiribati counterpart.

Every member of the world community is entitled to participate equally
in world affairs, Jiang told President Teburoro Tito of the island
country in the southern Pacific Ocean .

He met formally with Tito after an afternoon welcoming ceremony for
the six-member Kiribati delegation.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1986, the countries
have co-operated in trade, health care, science and technology and
culture, Jiang said, and they have yielded satisfactory results and
shown good development trends.

The two countries have also been understanding, supporting each other
in world affairs, he added.

Jiang said that both China and Kiribati are developing countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, have suffered from foreign invasions in the
past and are faced with the common task of developing national
economy.

Therefore, there is no conflict of interest between the two. Good
Sino-Kiribati relations will benefit not only both peoples, but also
Asia-Pacific stability.

China is willing to boost bilateral relations to a higher level on the
basis of mutual respect, friendly trust, and mutual benefit, the
Chinese president said.

Tito, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday for an eight-day State visit to
China, thanked Jiang for his invitation, saying he is happy to visit
China.

Kiribati cherishes its friendship with China, Tito said. He thanked
China for the unselfish aid to his country, which has a population of
80,000, has received in the past decade.

Kiribati hopes that China, as a big country, will continue to play a
significant role in the world, safeguarding peace, equal co-existence
and the common development of all countries, the guest said.

After the meeting, the two presidents attended the signing of a
bilateral economic agreement.

Kiribati is a major exporter of tuna fish.

China: Environment key to sustaining economic progress

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

SHANGHAI -- Environmental protection is "the key for China to sustain
economic development," the country's strategic task, State Councillor
Song Jian affirmed yesterday.

Song made his remarks at the fifth meeting of the China Council for
International Co-operation on Environment and Development (CCICED).
The meeting began in Shanghai yesterday and ends tomorrow.

In his report to the conference on China's environmental protection
and economic growth, Song said the State Council has asked government
officials at all levels, and all large enterprises, to increase their
efforts to protect the environment.

Though much progress has been made in environment protection, the
overall situation in China is still grave, Song said. Environmental
pollution, which began in urban areas, is spreading into rural areas.
In some areas, pollution is hampering economic development and even
posing a direct threat to people's health.

To combat pollution and improve the environment, Song said efforts
should be focused in seven areas:

o Policy-making by the central government and the legislative work
needed to draft stricter environmental laws and regulations;

o Increasing investment to finance environment projects through all
possible channels;

o Protection of ecosystems and controls over the exploitation of
natural resources;

o More research and development;

o Publicity campaigns to make people more conscious of the
environment;

o More international co-operation and exchanges to make China a key
participant in international environmental programmes;

o Development of China's environmental-protection industries.

During the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-95), many old factories that
were high energy consumers and had caused serious pollution were
moved out of urban areas. Several important environmental programmes
were also completed in that period.

For each 10,000 yuan ($1,200) worth of gross domestic product value,
the average energy consumed has been reduced from the equivalent of
5.3 tons of coal to 3.94 tons.

The sewage-treatment rate was improved from 32 per cent to 76 per cent
among industrial enterprises above the county level.

Hygiene and sanitation in urban areas were improved, and the national
forest-coverage rate was raised from 12 per cent in 1980 to the
present 13.92 per cent.

China: Ministry calls for efficiency in heating

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

WITH the growing threat of increasing energy consumption by building
projects, mainly in home heating and air conditioning, the Ministry
of Construction is encouraging the erection of energy conserving
housing and the introduction of new technology and products to ease
the problem.

The issue has become more urgent as 5.5 billion square metres of new
housing will be built in the country by the end of the century, while
the 29.7 billion square metres of housing projects that already exist
are consuming increasing amount of energy.

Home heating in winter in the north and air conditioning in summer in
the south have become major energy consumers, Minister of
Construction Hou Jie told the opening of a national working
conference in Beijing yesterday.

Despite the fact that warm housing is far from adequate in northern
China in winter, Hou said, the amount of coal burned for warmth last
year exceeded 127 million tons, or 10.7 per cent of the national
total energy consumption.

The rate is as high as 20-50 per cent in some extremely cold places,
Hou said.

In hot southern areas, 25-40 per cent of urban residents have air
conditioners in their houses, which contributes to the shortage of
electricity in those places.

Hou attributed the problem to old buildings and a growing number of
new construction projects.

Energy consumption does not take into account illumination and the hot
water supply yet.

He urged improvements to buildings to make sure they were warm in
winter and cool in summer while saving energy.

According to Vice-Minister of Construction Ye Rutang, the ministry
plans to build more energy-saving housing projects nationwide.
Experiments have been conducted in eight cities in northern China,
where home heating systems are widely used, he said.

Ye said that the ministry hopes that by the year 2000 the energy
consumption rate of newly-built urban housing projects with heating
systems will drop by 50 per cent, as compared with the standard in
the early 1980s.

During the State's Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000), Ye said his
ministry will focus on spreading new technologies and products such
as new thermal insulation building materials for walls and ceilings,
heat conserving windows, a concentrated heat supply system and solar
energy.

China: Highway vices curtailed

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

A SENIOR government official announced yesterday that efforts to
standardize the country's highway transport system during the past
two years have been "effective."

Guo Rubin, an official of the State Council, said at a press
conference that the highways in 13 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have been cleared of the so-called "three vices."

The three vices -- imposition of arbitrary service charges, collection
of illicit fees and installation of random checkpoints -- have been a
problem on most highways in many regions during recent years.

These problems have been controlled on national and provincial
highways in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jilin,
Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Hainan, Tibet and
Ningxia, said Guo.

Earlier last year, the ministries of communications and public
security and Guo's office co-sponsored a national drive to crack down
on the three vices.

Statistics from 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
suggest that 7,298 illegal checkpoints were removed between January
1995 and the end of last month.

The cases of illicit collection of fees and imposition of arbitrary
service charges have also been reduced sharply thanks to the
crackdown, said Guo.

This year alone, 2,264 cases of such problems have already been dealt
with and 2,697 people have been punished.

China: Children's book fair to be held in Beijing

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

A NATIONAL fair for children's publications will be at the Beijing
Exhibition Hall starting on October 2. More than 20,000 titles of
children's books, newspapers and periodicals will be displayed and
sold during the four-day event.

Organized by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Press and Publication
Administration, the fair will highlight the country's achievements in
children's publication work over the past several years and help
promote its development, said Yu Youxian, administrator of the
national press and publications.

Children's publishing houses from across the country will bring their
showcase books, audio and video cassettes and other electronic
products to the exhibition.

To enable young readers to afford the publications, a book sale will
be held at the Beijing Exhibition Hall on October 6, and will last
for three days.

The China Puppet Troupe, the China Leather-silhouette Troupe and the
Beijing Milky-Way Teenager Chorus will perform at the Beijing
Exhibition Hall during the children's publication fair as a special
welcome for the young visitors.

Twenty-one publishing houses will also donate some of their books to
children in remote and poor rural areas.

According to exhibition organizers, the country has established 29
publishing houses for children, which have published about 4,000 book
titles.

About 950 titles have been translated into 14 languages and exported
to more than 110 countries and regions around the world.

Since the first children's periodical was published in Beijing in
1930, 25 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have
created over a hundred such periodicals in many minority languages,
suitable for age groups below 18..

China: Poor girls get school aid

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 3

KUNMING, Yunnan Province -- As the upcoming semester approached,
13-year-old Guo Jiachu became more and more distraught. Her family
had sold its only pig to pay for her tuition after she was accepted
to the local middle school.

Guo, born in a small village by Lugu Lake on the border of Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces, was worried that she might not have tuition for the
next semester.

But thanks to the members of the Association of Businesswomen of the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ABACFIC), Guo will
receive 300 yuan ($36) a year for books, tuition and meals.

"Now I can keep my mind on my studies," Guo said with tears in her
eyes.

Guo is among 20 girls at the Luguhu Middle School who received
donations from the businesswomen's group. The entrepreneurs visited
the region from September 15 to 20 to investigate the status of local
education and the economy.

The programme is part of the Spring Bud Plan, which helps poor rural
girls finish their primary education, especially in poverty-stricken
areas.

"Poor education, transportation and communication are the main
problems that hinder economic development in these areas," said Annie
S. C. Wu, head of the group and Vice-chairwoman of the ABACFIC.
"Local people need more help from all circles, including the
businesswomen of non-State firms."

ABACFIC donated 300,000 yuan ($36,150) to establish a professional
skills school in Sichuan Province's Luguhu Town and in Yunnan
Province's Lijing prefecture.

"All the members of the ABACFIC understand that educating a girl means
educating a future mother, which is extremely crucial for improving
the quality of the next generation," Wu said.

In the last five years, the Spring Bud Plan has aided more than
100,000 girls in 28 provinces and autonomous regions, according to
official statistics.

Last year, the programme received 3.7 million yuan ($430,000) in cash
donations and 5 million yuan ($600,000) in goods.

Students like Guo may not be able to repay their benefactors in cash,
but they will reap huge returns through their successes.

Guo intends to study hard and go to a teachers college. Eventually,
she wants to teach people about her Mosuo culture, which retains
vestiges of a matriarchal society.

China: 38 die as Typhoon Willie wreaks havoc on Hainan

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 3

HAIKOU, Hainan Province -- At least 38 people are dead, scores are
injured and 96 are missing after Typhoon Willie violently swept over
most parts of Hainan, China's southern island province, over the
weekend.

Total damages and property losses due to Willie, the worst storm to
batter the semi-tropical island in 10 years, were believed very high
in many areas, although final reports are not available, local
authorities said.

Thousands of people were left stranded by floods due to Willie's heavy
rainfall, which flooded more than 100 villages along local rivers.

Locally stationed troops and relief forces have beefed up their
numbers to launch joint rescue operations.

Yesterday, it was reported evacuations of villagers from flooded areas
are continuing, with many awaiting rescue.

Damage reports so far indicate Hainan fared worse under Willie than
Xuwen Prefecture, the hardest-hit area in neighbouring Guangdong
Province, experts said.

In Hainan's Chengmai County, more than 400 millimetres of rain fell,
causing local rivers to overflow, flooding most parts of the town and
cutting off electricity, water supplies and transportation and
damaging many other facilities.

Six county residents were reported dead, rescue officials said, adding
more than 10,000 others stranded by flooding are now out of danger
thanks to rescue operations backed by armed forces troops.

In Hainan's Changjiang Li Autonomous County, 45 houses and 53 fishing
boats were washed away as floods weakened and breached parts of the
local breakwaters. As of yesterday, 30 people had drowned, and 96
remain missing.

In Qiongshan City, 26 villages along the Niandujiang River were
flooded and more than 38,300 hectares of farm land swamped. Some
crops were completely destroyed.

Over the past two days, more than 680 houses in the city collapsed and
over 3,100 houses were damaged either by floods or fierce winds
accompanying the typhoon, local officials said.

China: Japan must try to win trust of others

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

THE Japanese Government's tolerance of the landing by right-wingers on
the Diaoyu Islands indicates the regression of its policy towards
China, in some aspects, back to the days before the normalization of
bilateral relations, according to some observers in Beijing.

"Whether the Diaoyu Islands issue will be resolved amicably depends on
whether the Japanese Government adopts a wise attitude on the
territorial dispute," said Zhao Jieqi, deputy director of the
Japanese Studies Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The Japanese Government's abetment of the right-wingers' rampant
encroachment on China's territorial sovereignty has been deepening
mutual misunderstanding and is putting Sino-Japanese relations at
risk.

The explosion of the conflict on the Diaoyu Islands issue is not
sudden but is related to the changes in the macro-environment of the
international community and Japan itself, said Liu Jiangyong,
director of the Northeast Asia Division of the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations.

Since the end of the Cold War, Sino-Japanese relations have been
facing many challenges.

The disappearance of the "Soviet threat" undermined the basis of the
Japan-US military alliance. Japan had to find an excuse to justify
the presence of the US troops in Japan.

Thus in the early 1990s, the "China menace theory" began to emerge in
Japan and was deliberately spread by some Japanese, including
prominent politicians.

Also with its growing economic clout, Japan began to seek political
and military status commensurate with its economic strength.

Some Japanese government officials not only denied the crimes
committed in World War II by their militarists but also encouraged
the government to put pressure on other countries, using loans and
sanctions as weapons.

This strategy is a divergence from Japan's previous approach of
helping war-afflicted countries develop their economies as some sort
of compensation.

Relying on its financial power, Japan is now taking a less restrained
and discreet attitude towards its war crimes and other sensitive
issues. It is also boldly bypassing the restrictions set by its
Constitution and is strengthening its military forces.

Japan's military expenditure is the second largest in the world in
recent years.

Some Japanese politicians believe that the atonement for the history
of invasion will not only hurt "national pride" but also harm Japan's
image as a "power." Therefore, headed by prominent government
officials, some Japanese blatantly denied the existence of the
Nanjing Massacre, "comfort women" and even Japan's invasion of other
countries.

"A mood of reversion against China is growing among the misled
Japanese because China is constantly urging Japan to re-examine the
past mistakes," said Liu.

Last year, when the whole world commemorated the victory of the
anti-fascist war, Japan, as an initiator of World War II, passed an
indecent resolution against the theme of the anniversary.

In July, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the first Japanese Prime Minister to be
born after the war, paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine where class-A
war criminals are enshrined, heavily hurting the feelings of other
Asian peoples.

So strong is the non-recognition of crime sentiment in Japan that
politicians or ordinary Japanese who try to reveal the truth of
Japan's history of invasion would become the targets of attacks,
according to Liu.

Thus some politicians who treasure Sino-Japanese relations and
understand the friendship is in line with the interests of both
peoples find it more and more difficult to reverse the dangerous
trend.

Recent Japanese right-wingers' aggressive provocations on the Chinese
Diaoyu Islands further reflect their ambitions in international
politics, military development and territorial expansion.

A few Japanese are reluctant to see China, once a weak and bullied
country in modern history, grow stronger.

"These right-wingers hope to see, and also actively make troubles in
Sino-Japanese relations in order to propel Japan to turn right. The
Diaoyu Islands gives them a stage to perform," Zhao pointed out.

Every country and its people is sensitive about territory. That the
Diaoyu Islands belong to China since ancient times can be proved by
plenty of historical papers and facts, including those from Japan.

Therefore Japanese right-wingers' rampant trampling on China's
sovereignty stirred great indignation of both domestic and overseas
Chinese.

Japanese government officials' claim of sovereignty over the Diaoyu
Islands and threatening to use force will not help resolve the
problem but will worsen the conflict and harm Sino-Japanese
relations, said Zhao.

As for the Japanese government officials' claims that the government
cannot interfere with the activities of its people on its own
territory, Zhao believed it is mere subterfuge.

"International relations which involve ties with other countries
cannot be resolved as domestic affairs," said Zhao.

The Japanese Government should show sincerity in resolving the Diaoyu
Islands issue and take effective measures to prohibit the provocative
acts of the right-wingers.

China and Japan should hold dialogues on this issue and reach
consensus at the highest level. The dispute can be shelved until a
solution acceptable to both sides is found, Liu suggested.

The two countries' common interests dictate that partial disputes
should be resolved rationally and should not harm overall relations.
Sino-Japanese relations are significant for the peace and prosperity
of East Asia. Both of them will find it tough to co-exist as enemies.

For Japan which is seeking an increasingly important role on the
international stage, the primary concern of its foreign policy should
be how to win the trust of neighbouring countries.

But the point is whether Japanese politicians know this clearly, said
Liu.

China: More State firms turn to high-tech

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

THE introduction of high-technology is considered a cure for economic
ills by more and more deficit-stricken enterprises.

Before the recent exhibition of China's high-technology achievements
in Liaoning, a province with a high concentration of State-owned
enterprises, there was widespread skepticism that there would be an
audience for the expo since most State-owned enterprises are busy
tackling problems like rising deficits.

On display are high-tech achievement of a State programme dubbed
"Project 863" because it was first advocated in March 1986 by a group
of scientists who suggested that the government put more efforts into
high-tech research and development.

Despite the low expectations of some people, the week-long exhibition
proved a big success, and hosted an average of 7,000-plus visitors
each day. Among the visitors were government officials, enterprise
managers, professors and even peasants.

The exposition was aimed at the revitalization of traditional
industries by means of introducing advanced and new technologies.

The exposition wound up with 309 contracts for technology transfer
valued at 3.29 billion yuan ($396.3 million).

This co-operation between "Project 863" and State enterprises in
Liaoning signals the advent of mutual support between technology and
economy during the process of transition from a planned economy to a
market one, and from an extensive economy to an intensive economy,
according to an article in the Economic Information Daily.

The darlings of the traditional planned economy, many State
enterprises in Liaoning were ill-prepared for reform aimed at making
China's economy more market-oriented. While some firms have survived
the trials of the market, many others are on the verge of bankruptcy.

Now that factory directors and managers have finally realized they can
no longer depend on government coffers, they are starting to accept
that introduction of advanced sciences, and high-technology can be
their economic saviour.

This explains why the exposition was so well received in Liaoning.

The example of the Shenyang Air-blower Factory related at the expo
convinced many local managers that high-technology is something they
can turn to.

A small factory several years ago, Shenyang Air-blower Factory has
become China's largest producer of compressors and blowers thanks to
the introduction of high-tech operations.

After visiting the exhibition, many factory and company officials said
they are keen on technological upgrading to shake off their problems.

The Liaoning provincial government has showed great interest in
high-tech projects.

Before the exhibition had even ended, the local government had struck
an agreement with the State Science and Technology Commission to
usher in a system of joint meetings to promote the application of the
research achievements of "Project 863" in Liaoning.

China: Time to counter negative views on China

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

"China Through My Eyes" is sponsored by the State Bureau of Foreign
Experts Affairs and China Daily. It features our foreign readers'
impressions, suggestions and criticisms regarding developments in
China. Contributions are welcome.

By Zhang Yanyan

AS an overseas Chinese, I cannot help feeling insulted and concerned
over the way Western journalists and politicians continuously try to
tarnish China's image.

They do not accept Chinese views which are rational and based on
traditional concepts of philosophy and righteousness, but want to
turn everything concerning Chinese affairs into nasty, negative
nothings.

US's policy towards China is one of sabotaging, bullying and
trouble-making. That is why the US tells China off and spreads bad
propaganda about the lack of human rights in China.

As an overseas Chinese well-read in history and literature, I have
deep sympathy for the Chinese people. There is much that is good and
deep in Chinese traditions and history to learn from and build upon
but also much that is bad and evil to analyze and reflect upon, so
that evil will not be repeated.

To realize the Chinese utopia, a dream of past generations, the
Chinese must stay united. China must have stability.

However, that is difficult, for the Western politicians and
journalists, as well as many naive Chinese, are hacking at it. The
West propagates the uncertainty of stability in the future because
they profit economically in all ways from a weak and unstable
country. Some Chinese regard this to be a fact and unwittingly echo
the damaging intent in their naivety. This is certainly not good for
the Chinese people and for business. That would be like playing into
the enemy's trap.

The Chinese Government should be strong and knowledgeable about how to
strengthen the stability and security of China in all areas of life
and politics. There should be an intelligent body of scholars,
administrators, scientists, soldiers, journalists, professionals and
representatives of the districts and villages including overseas
Chinese and business people.

There are strong grounds in traditional, revolutionary and
post-revolutionary Chinese history, culture and politics to signal
the important contribution China can make towards universal peace and
advancements in all areas of human civilization. This is the only
truly political message that everyone, East and West, will accept and
cherish.

There are many good people and good things in the West and there are
many Western intellectuals who have loved, supported and hoped with
China and for China. Let China live up the best of everyone's
expectations. China will also need the continuation of her past
ideologies and excellent organization that once established a
crime-free, honest, supportive and universal humanitarian society as
in the 1950s.

I believe China should and can expand its influence in peaceful,
useful and intelligent ways for the benefit of its own people as well
as human kind. In China, there must be a good, strong and confident
government open to the views of the Chinese, Western and others whose
role is to ensure peace and unity and the security of all Chinese,
and everyone else in China.

China should have good, strong and effective defence featuring the
latest technological innovations. (This is to ensure that China will
not be bullied by aggressors.)

However, the most universal of human ideals -- happiness, peace and a
good quality of life -- should be the priority in all Chinese
affairs. China should work more intelligently to make and cultivate
friendships with the developed and less developed nations of the
world.

China: Agreement focuses on electrical insulators

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5

A CONTRACT for establishing a $25 million tripartite joint venture was
signed yesterday in Beijing by Chinese and Japanese companies.

The NGK Insulators Tangshan Co Ltd will be jointly invested by the
Tangshan High Voltage Insulator Works in Hebei Province, and by NGK
Insulators Ltd and Itochu Corp of Japan.

The Chinese side holds only a 5 per cent stake in the investment,
while NGK controls 76 per cent. The remaining 19 per cent is held by
Itochu.

The joint venture, scheduled to start production in 1998, will have an
annual production output of 1.8 million units of suspension
insulators used for electrical transmission lines.

The venture will employ 400 people and is projecting annual sales
income of $30 million by 1999.

Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, encouraged the Japanese investors during a
meeting before the signing of the contract, saying that development
of the power industry in China will have a bright future.

Hebei Provincial Governor Ye Liansong told the Japanese investors that
in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the power industry will be
the key sector of development in the coastal province.

In the coming five years, Hebei plans to meet growing power demand by
constructing plants with a total electricity generating capacity of 6
million kilowatts.

The country as a whole will increase its electricity generating
capacity by an estimated 80 million kilowatts during the period, Ye
said.

Ye said these trends augur well for the joint venture, whose products
are widely used by power plants and electricity transmission lines.

Products of the joint venture will eventually be exported to the
international market, according to Mike Shibata, president and chief
executive officer of NGK Insulators.

Itochu Corp, one of the largest Japanese trading companies, is the
first Japanese company to open a representative office in China after
1949. Last year, its trade volume with China reached about $5.5
billion.

In addition to trade, Itochu has also been active in committing
investment in the Chinese market.

So far, it has established about 150 joint ventures on the Chinese
mainland, involving textiles, food, metals and machinery.

Itochu says it plans to establish more joint ventures in the coming
years as more than 100 new projects are under negotiation with
Chinese partners.
