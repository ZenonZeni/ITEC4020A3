<h2>The DRUG WAR- Colombia Is Implementing Antidrug Efforts, but
Impact Is Uncertain</h2>

<p><b>Statement of Joseph E. Kelley, Director-in-Charge,
International Affairs Issues, National Security and International
Affairs Division</b> </p>

<p><b>GAO/T-NSIAD-94-53</b> </p>

<p><b>October 5. 1993</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>GAO Testimony </p>

<p>Before the Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security
Committee on Government Operations, U.S. House of Representatives
</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: </p>

<p>I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent report on
the progress and problems that U.S. and Colombian agencies have
experienced in implementing U.S. antidrug programs in Colombia
between fiscal years 1990 and 1992. This report is a follow-up to
our initial report that was issued in September 1991.1 </p>

<p>In August 1989, President Bush approved the Andean Strategy, a
major component of the U.S. national drug control strategy, which
is designed to help reduce the supply of illegal drugs being
shipped to the United States. </p>

<p><u>RESULTS IN BRIEF</u> </p>

<p>In the 3 years since the Andean Strategy was announced,
Colombia has demonstrated its commitment and political will by
taking action to support U.S. counternarcotics objectives. It has
applied pressure against drug-trafficking activities through law
enforcement and military actions and has disrupted
drug-trafficking activities in Colombia and, as a result, U.S.
officials believe these programs are effective. The effectiveness
of Colombia's efforts and U.S. programs could not be determined
however, because U.S. officials lack the data needed to make such
an assessment-specifically the amount of cocaine being shipped
from Colombia to the United States. </p>

<p>My testimony point out that various obstacles have hindered
the implementation and effectiveness of U.S. efforts in Colombia.
These obstacles included the limited ability of some Colombian
agencies to plan and implement effective programs, increased
insurgency and narcoterrorist activities, the expansion of drug
trafficking activities into opium cultivation, corruption within
the Colombian government, and the lack of effective antidrug
programs in other neighboring countries. Further my testimony
describes certain U.S. management problems that have hindered the
planning and implementation of U.S. antidrug programs in
Colombia. </p>

<p>-- The State Department reduced the funding for military and
law enforcement programs because of budgetary constraints. These
constraints have impeded and will continue to impede programs
that U.S. Embassy officials believe are needed to enhance
Colombia's antidrug capabilities. U.S. Embassy officials stated,
however, that even if the enhancement programs were fully funded,
they did not know whether these programs would fulfill U.S.
antidrug objectives or whether more funds would be needed. We
believe that it will be difficult to determine what funding
levels are needed to fully meet U.S. antidrug objectives because
the cartels are flexible and can easily adjust their operations
to elude law enforcement efforts, and are expanding their
activities in Colombia and elsewhere. </p>

<p><u>Drug War: Observations on U.S. Counternarcotics Aid to
Colombia </u>(GAO/NSIAD-91-296, Sept. 30, 1991). </p>

<p>We also note that poor coordination among U.S. agencies has
resulted in the inefficient use of resources, and weaknesses in
inventory and financial management practices affecting Colombian
national police programs are hindering program effectiveness. </p>

<p>Regarding the oversight of U.S. programs, U.S. military
officials have been slow to implement end-use monitoring plans
and U.S. Embassy officials cannot provide assurance that U.S.
policies regarding the use of aid and human rights are being met.
Our recent report makes recommendations to the Director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy regarding the need to
reevaluate antidrug programs in Colombia and throughout the
Andean region and to the Secretary of State to improve the
management and oversight of U.S.-provided aid. </p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND</u> </p>

<p>In August 1989, President Bush approved the Andean Strategy, a
major component of the U.S. national drug control strategy, which
is designed to help reduce the supply of illegal drugs, including
cocaine and heroin, being shipped to the United States. Under
that strategy, the United States provides increased levels of
military, law enforcement, and economic aid to Bolivia, Colombia,
and Peru to assist them to disrupt drug-trafficking activities.
The United States places special emphasis on Colombia because it
is the leading source country for processed cocaine. Furthermore,
Colombia is the home of two major cartels, Medellin and Cali,
that are responsible for most of the drug-related activity. </p>

<p>Simply put, the goal of U.S. counternarcotics programs in
Colombia is to assist that government in its efforts to disrupt
and ultimately dismantle drug-trafficking activities within its
borders. Between fiscal years 1990 and 1992, the United States
agreed to provide about $504.3 million worth of aid to assist the
Colombian government to achieve this goal. of this amount, the
United States agreed to provide Colombia with $397.2 million
worth of military and law enforcement aid and guaranteed loans
from the Export-Import Bank to improve the capabilities of law
enforcement and military organizations to disrupt
drug-trafficking activities. The remaining $107.1 million was
economic aid designed to improve Colombia's balance of payments,
strengthen its judiciary and economy, and support poppy
eradication operations of the police. </p>

<p><u>PROGRAMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED, BUT IMPACT IS UNCERTAIN</u>
</p>

<p>The United States and Colombia are undertaking a variety of
programs and initiatives to meet U.S. counternarcotics objectives
for Colombia. Colombia has increased efforts designed to disrupt
some drug-related activities of the major cartels. Although U.S.
officials admit that these efforts have not significantly reduced
the availability of cocaine in the United States, they believe
that the efforts are effective and should be continued. However,
we do not believe that the effectiveness of these efforts can be
assessed because U.S. officials lack the data needed to make such
a determination. Furthermore, the potential impact that U.S.
programs are having on drug-related activities are affected by
various obstacles in and around Colombia. </p>

<p><u>Antidrug Programs Are Being Implemented</u> </p>

<p>U.S. aid is being used to implement various programs designed
to meet U.S. antidrug objectives in Colombia. For example: </p>

<p>-- The first objective is to strengthen the institutional and
political will of the Colombian government to take action against
drug-trafficking activities. Improving the judicial system is a
high priority of this objective. In 1990, the U.S. Agency for
International Development began developing a 6-year, $36 million
program designed to improve Colombia's judicial system. We found
that progress is beginning to be made on improving that system. </p>

<p>The second and third objectives relate to improving the
capabilities that are needed for the Colombian government to
conduct counternarcotics operations against drug-related
activities. Most of the $397.2 million in military and law
enforcement aid and guaranteed loans have provided the Colombian
law enforcement and military organizations with the equipment,
training, and support needed to improve their capabilities. </p>

<p>The fourth objective is to strengthen Colombia's economy. As
of April 1992, the United States had provided about $41 million
in Economic Support Funds to reduce Colombia's debt to the United
States and multilateral lenders. This allowed Colombia to use its
own funds to soften the impact of reducing the role of illicit
drugs in the economy, financing alternative development projects,
and supporting drug awareness programs. </p>

<p><u>Colombia Is Taking Action to Disrupt Drug-Trafficking
Activities</u> </p>

<p>Our review indicated that Colombia's actions are disrupting
drugtrafficking activities. Between calendar years 1990 and 1992,
the Colombian government seized 177 metric tons of cocaine,
destroyed 737 labs, and destroyed over 13,000 hectares of opium
poppy. </p>

<p>Both the United States and Colombia made law enforcement
operations against the Medellin cartel, headed by Pablo Escobar,
their initial priority because of the cartel's dominant role in
cocaine production and terrorism. In March 1993, the Drug
Enforcement Administration reported that these efforts have
resulted in disrupting many of the cartel's activities. In
addition, Pablo Escobar turned himself into the government for
trial in 1991. Although he escaped from prison in mid-1992, U.S.
officials believe that his power has substantially declined. </p>

<p>The Colombian government has also begun to take law
enforcement action against the Cali cartel. One operation
resulted in the seizure of more than $54 million from bank
accounts maintained in five countries. </p>

<p>Despite Colombia's efforts to disrupt drug-trafficking
activities, U.S. officials admitted that cocaine remains readily
available to U.S. users. However, these officials believe that
U.S. programs in Colombia should continue to be funded because
they are effective in disrupting drug-trafficking activities and
in meeting U.S. counternarcotics goals. </p>

<p><u>Data to Measure Program Impacts and Contributions Are
Lacking</u> </p>

<p>We do not believe that U.S. officials can determine the impact
of efforts to disrupt drug-trafficking activities or their
contribution to reduce the supply of cocaine being shipped from
Colombia to the United States because they lack the data to make
this assessment. U.S. officials recognize that problems exist
with the data that is being used to measure effectiveness. </p>

<p>Statistics such as seizures, labs destroyed, number of
arrests, or changes in the prices and availability of cocaine are
frequently used as measures of effectiveness. However, these data
by themselves cannot be used to evaluate the effectiveness of
programs. For example, while increased seizures are generally
viewed as an indicator of success, a decrease in seizures does
not necessarily mean that a program is less effective than it was
previously. Furthermore, estimates used to determine drug
availability and consumption are generally not designed to
measure the effectiveness of individual U.S. interdiction
programs. </p>

<p>To evaluate the impact of Colombia's antidrug efforts to
disrupt drug-related activities or reduce the supply of cocaine
being shipped from Colombia to the United States, U.S. officials
would need information on the amount of cocaine being shipped
into the United States, the deterrent effect that these efforts
have on drug-related activities, and the effectiveness of
interdiction alternatives. This data is not available. Without
this data it is difficult to determine the impact and
contribution that programs in Colombia are making in meeting U.S.
antidrug goals. For example, without knowing the amount of
cocaine being shipped out of Colombia into the United States,
neither the percentage of cocaine being interdicted nor the
effectiveness of antidrug operations in reducing the amount of
cocaine can be easily determined. </p>

<p><u>Long-Term Commitment Is Needed</u> </p>

<p>Even though U.S. officials recognize that they lack the data
needed to determine program success, they believe that the
national drug strategy's goals of disrupting drug-trafficking
activities and reducing the supply of cocaine entering the United
States will require a long-term commitment on the part of the
United States and Colombia to continue law enforcement efforts. </p>

<p>According to U.S. officials, Colombia's efforts against the
cartels are similar to U.S. law enforcement efforts against
organized crime, which has existed for many years. In fact, these
officials stated that Colombia faces even more significant
obstacles than the United States does because it has limited
resources and technologies available to fight the cartels and the
cartels are as powerful or more powerful than many criminal
organizations in the United States. </p>

<p><u>Obstacles Hinder U.S. Programs</u> </p>

<p>Various obstacles in and around Colombia are hindering the
effectiveness of U.S. programs in Colombia. They include the
following: </p>

<p>Colombia's ability to plan and implement effective
counternarcotics programs has weaknesses. Various U.S. reports
show that some civilian agencies as well as the police have not
been effective in planning or implementing programs. </p>

<p>Increased active insurgency and narcoterrorism activities in
large sections of Colombia hinder the government's efforts to
maintain the presence needed to sustain counternarcotics
pressure. Two guerilla groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the National Liberation Army, are reportedly
involved in drug-trafficking activities in Colombia. </p>

<p>The cartels are expanding their activities into heroin. U.S.
estimates show that in less than 2 years, poppy cultivation in
Colombia has expanded from about 2,500 to about 32,700 hectares.
In early 1992, the Colombian government formally approved an
aerial eradication program to supplement its manual program
because it was concerned about this expansion. Under the program,
the police are using helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft
originally provided by the United States for cocaine operations
for aerial poppy eradication. As a result, cocaine operations
have declined, while poppy eradication operations have increased.
Current plans show that increases in aid will be needed to
continue operations against cocaine interdiction and poppy
eradication. </p>

<p>Various U.S. Embassy reports show that corruption exists
throughout the government. Corruption was a primary reason why
Pablo Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, escaped in mid-1992
from prison to avoid prosecution. </p>

<p>Colombian programs will not succeed unless other regional
antidrug programs are effective. We have reviewed programs in
Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, and Mexico. Our reports
show that significant obstacles have also impeded the
effectiveness of these programs. U.S. officials stated that even
if Colombia were successful in eliminating drugtrafficking
activities within its borders, the trafficking would spill over
into other countries, especially countries that were not
aggressive in interdiction efforts. </p>

<p><u>U.S. MANAGEMENT DIFFICULTIES HINDER IMPLEMENTATION OF
COUNTERNARCOTICS PROGRAMS</u> </p>

<p>Both the U.S. Embassy and the Defense Department reported
numerous problems in planning and implementing counternarcotics
programs in Colombia. For example the U.S. Embassy had numerous
problems in procuring equipment for the police in a timely,
efficient, and effective manner. </p>

<p>We also found several problems that affected the ability of
the United States to implement programs in a timely, efficient,
and effective manner. These problems included the inability of
the State Department to provide funding levels needed to
implement programs that U.S. officials believe are needed to meet
U.S. antidrug objectives, the lack of effective coordination
between the Departments of State and Defense, and inventory and
financial management. </p>

<p><u>Budgetary Constraints Limit Available Funding to Support
Programs</u> </p>

<p>To implement the counternarcotics strategy in Colombia, the
United States has primarily relied on two funding sources--the
Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP) and the International
Narcotics Control Program, both managed by the State Department.
Since 1992, the State Department has not allocated the funding
needed to support the programs that U.S. officials in Colombia
believe are needed to meet U.S. counternarcotics objectives. </p>

<p>· <u>The Drug War: U.S. Programs in Peru Face Serious
Obstacles </u>(GAO/NSIAD-92-36, Oct. 21, 1991); <u>The Drug War:
Extent of Problems in Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela</u>
(GAO/NSIAD-92-226, June 5, 1992); <u>The War on Drugs: Narcotics
Control in Panama </u>(GAO/NSIAD-91-233, July 16, 1991) ; and <u>Drug
Control: Revised Drug Interdiction Approach Is Needed in Mexico</u>
(GAO/NSIAD-93-152, May 10, 1993). </p>

<p>In fiscal years 1992 and 1993, U.S. officials in Colombia
estimated that $116 million worth of FMFP aid would be needed to
implement various programs to improve the capabilities of the
police and military organizations involved in counternarcotics
operations. However, because of budget constraints, the State
Department allocated only $73 million. As a result many of the
counternarcotics requirements for law enforcement and military
organizations could not be funded. </p>

<p>In fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the U.S. Embassy estimated that
law enforcement programs funded under the International Narcotics
Control Program would need about $62.1 million worth of aid to
support several existing projects. However, because of budgetary
constraints, the State Department provided only about $45.4
million, which was not considered to be adequate to fully support
even one of the several projects. </p>

<p>Budgetary constraints may continue to affect the U.S. ability
to provide the funds that may be needed to meet additional
requirements that U.S. officials believe Colombia needs to fight
drug-related activities. In early 1992, the U.S. Embassy
recognized that additional requirements, not included in original
plans, would be needed to strengthen the counternarcotics
capabilities of both law enforcement and military organizations.
In reviewing an enhancement plan developed by the U.S. Embassy,
the executive branch decided that before any funding would be
provided, two criteria would have to be met. First, requirements
had to meet critical needs, and second, the Colombian government
had to be able to absorb the equipment. Based on its analysis,
the executive branch identified about $12 million worth of
additional aid to provide. According to the office of National
Drug Control Policy, this aid was delivered in April and May
1993. Even though the U.S. Embassy believes that additional
requirements are needed, the executive branch has not included
more funding for the plan in fiscal years 1993 and 1994. </p>

<p>U.S. Embassy officials stated that these actions will affect
implementation of the enhanced programs in Colombia. However,
they admitted that even if all the requirements identified in the
enhancement plan were fully funded, they did not know whether the
funding would be adequate to fully meet U.S. antidrug objectives
or whether additional funds would be needed. </p>

<p>We believe that it is difficult to determine what funding
levels will be needed to achieve U.S. antidrug objectives in
Colombia because the cartels are flexible and can easily adjust
their operations to elude law enforcement efforts. Also, they are
expanding their activities (i.e. relocating activities in
sections of Colombia where the government cannot maintain control
and diversifying operations into opium-related drug-trafficking
activities) within Colombia and elsewhere. </p>

<p><u>Coordination and Management of Inventory and Finance
Difficulties</u> </p>

<p>Our review also indicated that the Departments of State and
Defense were not effectively coordinating some of their programs.
This lack of coordination has led to an inefficient use of
resources. For example, reports indicated that the Colombian air
force could not use some U.S.-provided equipment because it was
either the wrong type or was missing parts. we also found that
various offices within the U.S. Embassy had not effectively
implemented a police helicopter training course. As a result, the
program was charged a cancellation fee of $297,000 when the
police did not send students to the course in January 1992. </p>

<p>We also found that, because of ineffective inventory and
financial management practices, the State Department could not
provide adequate logistics support in a timely manner. The
resulting lack of spare parts hindered U.S. ability to meet its
goal of maintaining a 70-percent availability rate for police
aircraft. Various administrative financial management problems
also exist. For example, contractors were not paid in a timely
manner for services performed, which has led to difficulties in
supporting the antidrug programs and has had a detrimental effect
on antidrug operations. </p>

<p><u>OVERSIGHT OF U.S. PROGRAMS IS LACKING</u> </p>

<p>U.S. military officials have been slow to implement the
monitoring plans that they believe are needed to provide adequate
assurances that U.S. aid is being used as intended. Although U.S.
officials informed us in 1991 that such plans were being
implemented, they had not been fully implemented at the time of
our review. Furthermore, U.S. officials did not have procedures
or the data to determine whether units involved in human rights
abuses had received U.S. aid. We found two instances where
individuals reportedly involved in human rights abuses belonged
to particular units that had received U.S. aid. </p>

<p><u>RECOMMENDATIONS</u> </p>

<p>Because (1) U.S. officials lack the data needed to evaluate
program effectiveness, (2) various obstacles impede program
implementation, (3) additional resource requirements have been
identified to meet the expanding drug trade, and (4) U.S.
budgetary constraints will continue, we have recommended that the
Director of the office of National Drug Control Policy, in
conjunction with other agencies, reevaluate U.S. antidrug
programs in Colombia and throughout the Andean region to
determine what the U.S. antidrug objectives should be for each
country. We also recommended that the Director evaluate what
types of programs should be included, what funding would be
necessary to support these programs, and whether this funding
would ensure that the programs could significantly disrupt
drug-trafficking activities and reduce the supply of cocaine
being shipped to the United States. As part of this reevaluation,
a quantitative baseline should be established to evaluate
progress that U.S. antidrug programs in Colombia and the other
Andean countries are having on meeting established U.S. antidrug
objectives and goals. </p>

<p>Our report also includes other recommendations to the
Secretary of State that are designed to improve the management
and oversight of U.S.-provided aid to ensure that it is used in
an efficient and effective manner and in accordance with U.S.
policies. </p>

<p>This concludes my testimony. I will be happy to answer any
questions you or the Subcommittee may have regarding our review. </p>
