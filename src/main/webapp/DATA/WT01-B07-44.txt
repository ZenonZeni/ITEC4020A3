<H3><I>Conference Report by Malcolm Orme</I></H3>

<P>
The 17th Annual AIVC Conference was convened this year at Hotel
11 in Gothenburg, in western Sweden. For the first time, an invitation
was extended to all participating countries of the <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/" >IEA Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems Programme  
</A>. This resulted in over 100 delegates attending 4 sessions
of oral presentations based on submitted papers and a further
3 poster sessions, a total of 59 presentations from 15 countries.
Topics covered included:<BR>

<H3><A NAME="Keynote">Keynote </A>Speaker and the Opening Session
</H3>

<P>
The Keynote Speaker at the Conference, Bertil Pettersson, Director
General of the Swedish Board for Building Research, stated in
his address that much of the world's energy is obtained and used
in a non-sustainable way. He continued by stressing that existing
energy supplies must be used more efficiently and renewable energy
sources should be further exploited. Citing the example of Sweden,
he indicated that while the total floor area of the Swedish residential
and service sector building stock had increased by about 40% from
1970 to 1995, the total energy consumption had remained roughly
constant. This implied that the specific energy consumption (energy
used per unit of floor area) had decreased by approximately 25%
during the same period. Furthermore, he also outlined the benefits
of International Energy Agency collaborative research with the
aim of decreasing total energy consumption. The benefits that
he observed included:
<UL>
<LI>shared costs,
<LI>pooled resources,
<LI>the avoidance of mistakes and duplicated efforts, and
<LI>the development of a common understanding of technical methods.
</UL>

<P>
The first paper in the opening session, called &quot;<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n3" >Optimum ventilation and air flow control in buildings?  
</A>&quot;, examined the overall theme of the Conference, and
was presented by Tor-G&ouml;ran Malmstr&ouml;m (<A HREF="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html" >Royal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Sweden). In this paper he explained the factors affecting
indoor air quality. In particular, he emphasised that internal
pollutant sources should first be controlled and then the quality
of the air entering the room should be verified. He then continued
by discussing how air flow control can be used to determine the
quality and rate of air exchange.
<P>
This session also included <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n4" >a paper by Bjørn Larsen
</A> (The Vekst Foundation, Norway) explaining his computerised
method ( <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1  </A>) for balancing ventilation
systems, a practical demonstration of which was also given at
the Conference. The method he described makes it possible to pre-set
ventilation terminals at the factory to desired pressure loss
characteristics (achieved by damper positioning). In this way,
mechanical ventilation systems can be balanced before they have
been installed.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="Offices">Offices </A>and Other Non-Residential Buildings
</H3>

<P>
Two contributions from the UK <A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >Building Research Establishment  
</A>focused on office buildings. <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n49" >Martin White
</A> discussed the efficiency of single-sided and cross ventilation
in office spaces, while <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n59" >Brian Webb
</A> considered summer cooling for office-type buildings by night
ventilation. Although not restricted in application to non-residential
buildings, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n60" >Matheos Santamouris</A>
(University of Athens, Greece) reported on the progress of the
natural ventilation studies made within the European PASCOOL project.
This included single-sided and cross ventilation, as well as flow
through large internal openings in the context of natural ventilation
for cooling. The project has resulted in the development of several
applicable calculation tools. Passive cooling was also the subject
of other presentations from <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n12" >Greece
</A>, Sweden and <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n15" >Switzerland </A>(
<A HREF="#Figure2" >Figure 2  </A>).<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n11" >Mikko Suokas</A> (Fincoil-teollisuus
Oy, Finland) advised on how to reduce draught problems in cooled
working rooms. His view was that the 'throw' from air-cooling
devices should stay close to the ceiling for as long as possible,
without interference from either beams, light fittings, or walls.
In this way, the cooled air mixes better with the existing room
air, without causing draughts in the occupied zone.
<P>
Peter Wouters from Belgium (BBRI) expanded on the subject of non-residential
ventilation. In &quot;<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n23" >Ventilation requirements in non-domestic buildings and energy efficiency
</A>&quot;, voted as the Best Paper at the Conference, he proposed
that ventilation rate requirements for non-domestic buildings
may vary by up to a factor of 10 depending on whether or not the
levels of emissions from the building materials are taken into
account. This, he argued, could potentially have a large consequent
effect on energy consumption. <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n38" >Anders Nilson
</A> (Bengt Dahlgren AB, Sweden) also considered energy efficiency,
specifically in office buildings, with an energy and system analysis
study.
<H4>Public Assembly Buildings</H4>

<P>
Findings from measurements made in a cinema (with a downwards
mixing ventilation system) were reported by Yonghui Jin (Narvik
Institute of Technology, Norway). 'Step-up' and 'step-down' tracer
gas measurements enabled the calculation of local and room air
change efficiencies, which indicated that close to perfect mixing
was occurring. Carbon dioxide concentrations were found to vary
linearly with the number of occupants. The design of another type
of public assembly building, in this case a naturally ventilated
concert hall (<A HREF="#Figure3" >Figure 3  </A>), was discussed
by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n47" >Robert Cohen</A> (HGA Consulting
Engineers Ltd, UK). This project used computational fluid dynamics
to decide the size and locations of the ventilation openings.
In addition, a dynamic thermal model was used to confirm that
the likely number of hours per year above a certain temperature
level was acceptable.<BR>

<H3>Ventilation of <A NAME="Transportation">Transportation</A>-Related
Structures</H3>

<P>
Certain presentations at the Conference examined ventilation of
structures intended for transportation-related purposes. <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n43" >Willem de Gids
</A> (<A href="http://www.tno.nl/instit/bouw/home.html" >TNO  
</A>, Netherlands) described how a dynamic ventilation model had
been used to improve the design of a ventilation system in a train
tunnel with a shopping centre above (<A HREF="#Figure4" >Figure 4  
</A>), thus improving air quality in the centre and reducing cleaning
costs. The problems associated with the cooling and ventilation
of a high speed underground transportation system were outlined
by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n14" >Peter Rosemann</A> (<A HREF="http://www.ethz.ch/" >Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Switzerland). This major project plans to link the major
Swiss cities with a train network involving partially evacuated
tunnels (to reduce aerodynamic drag). In addition, design guidelines
for ventilation systems for pollution control in large semi-enclosed
bus terminals were presented. Concerning this work, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n13" >Joanna Yiu
</A> (Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong) indicated that
industrial occupational exposure limits were the most applicable
existing guidelines to deal with the pollutants contained in diesel
fuel exhausts. However, she did not consider them to be ideal,
because they are based on working conditions only for healthy
adults. <BR>

<H3><A NAME="Statistical">Statistical </A>Analysis</H3>

<P>
In his poster, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n17" >Jerzy Sowa</A> (Warsaw
University of Technology, Poland) compared different methods of
incorporating stochastic factors into deterministic models of
indoor air quality. Approaches taken used time series data as
inputs to contaminant dispersal models, Monte-Carlo analysis,
and a stochastic differential equation model. The mean values
of pollutant concentration found with all three methods were very
similar. However, the spread of the results as measured by the
standard deviation showed a wide variation. Related work was described
by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n40" >Krystyna Pietrzyk</A> (<A HREF="http://www.hvac.chalmers.se/" >Chalmers University of Technology  
</A>, Sweden). She explained how probability density functions
of the air change rate in a single family house had been derived,
with two-parameter Weibull distributions assumed for the wind
velocity. The air change rates were found to approximately follow
either normal or log-normal distributions depending on the wind
direction.
<P>
<A HREF="ra74_2.html#n41" >Johnny Kronvall</A> (J&amp;W Consulting
Engineers, Sweden) has been investigating system safety analysis
as a method of finding &quot;the probability that a ventilation
system provides certain required air flow rates in each occupied
part of a building during the time between scheduled maintenance
occasions.&quot; He suggested that this is a promising technique
for judging the reliability of mechanical ventilation systems.
But, he cautioned that data for the mechanical reliability of
individual components would need to be collated for it to be practical.
<H3>Applicability of <A NAME="Crack">Crack </A>Flow Equations
</H3>

<P>
Two of the fundamental assumptions concerning the applicability
of crack flow equations have been investigated by researchers
in the UK and the USA. An experimental study of crack flow with
varying pressure differentials was the subject of a presentation
given by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n36" >Steve Sharples</A> (<A HREF="http://www.shef.ac.uk/" >University of Sheffield  
</A>, UK). He proposed that the results confirmed the often assumed
view that it is acceptable to consider average steady-state pressure
differentials in place of time-varying differentials. Another
important issue discussed at the Conference was that the application
of experimentally measured airtightness data (typically measured
at greater than 10 Pa pressure difference) to numerical models
often relies on an extrapolation down to the pressure differences
(typically less than 10 Pa) encountered due to natural driving
forces. The power law is an appropriate method for extrapolating
from measured airtightness data to lower pressure differences
was the conclusion reached by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n42" >Max Sherman
</A> (<A href="http://www.lbl.gov/" >Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  
</A>, USA).
<H3>Measures of Ventilation <A NAME="Performance">Performance
</A></H3>

<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n10" >Lars Ekberg</A> (<A HREF="http://www.hvac.chalmers.se/" >Chalmers University of Technology  
</A>, Sweden) spoke about how he has been checking ventilation
rates by carbon dioxide monitoring. Again from Sweden, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n34" >Björn Hedin
</A> (Lund Institute of Technology) introduced a new model to
extract more information from standard tracer gas measurements
of ventilation air flows. The effect of recirculation on air change
effectiveness (sometimes called the coefficient of air change
performance) was the subject of a contribution by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n5" >Clifford Federspiel
</A> (Johnson Controls Inc, USA). He proposed a relative measure
of air change effectiveness that can be used to take into account
the age of supply air when the fraction of recirculated air is
greater than zero. An advantage of this measure, he argued, is
that it can identify systems in which 'short-circuiting' is occurring.
<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n25" >Karl Janssens</A> from Belgium (Catholic
University of Leuven) gave an account of laboratory tests for
the determination of 'local specific fresh air flow rates' in
an imperfectly mixed ventilated air space. In addition, work from
France and the UK reported on measurements and modelling respectively
for calculating the pollutant removal effectiveness and air change
efficiency for various ventilation strategies.
<H3>External <A NAME="Contaminants">Contaminants </A>and the Internal
Distribution of Pollutants</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n7" >Vina Kukadia</A>, (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >Building Research Establishment  
</A>, UK) presented the outcome of a pilot study designed to find
the effect of external atmospheric pollution on indoor air quality.
Another external pollutant, radon, is of continuing concern and
in connection with this, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n8" >Pirjo Korhonen
</A> (University of Kuopio, Finland) has compared indoor levels
of radon between workplaces and homes located nearby in different
parts of Finland. Certain features of particulate pollution interactions
with indoor surfaces were explained by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n9" >Miriam Byrne
</A> (<A HREF="http://www.ic.ac.uk/" >Imperial College  </A>,
UK), who has been carrying out measurements and modelling for
risk assessment and contaminant control. Also at the Conference,
George Walton (<A href="http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/bed.html" >NIST  
</A>, USA) demonstrated the latest version of his multizone airflow
and contaminant dispersal model, CONTAM96, which includes a graphical
user interface.
<H3><A NAME="Dwellings">Dwellings</A></H3>

<P>
The work of members of the European Standards Committee CEN TC156
(Ventilation) was reported by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n39" >Andrew Cripps
</A> (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >Building Research Establishment  
</A>, UK) with his paper on calculation methods for the determination
of air flow rates in dwellings. Two delegates from Sweden each
talked about residential ventilation. One of these was <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n54" >Per Levin
</A> (<A HREF="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html" >Royal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Sweden), who outlined the development of a simple occupancy-controlled
exhaust air ventilation system. The other was <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n27" >Åke Blomsterberg
</A> (Swedish National Testing and Research Institute, Sweden),
who discussed the influence of outdoor air vents and airtightness
on natural ventilation.
<P>
<A HREF="ra74_1.html#n22" >Max Sherman</A> (<A href="http://www.lbl.gov/" >Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  
</A>, USA) proposed the most appropriate types of residential
ventilation systems for the different regions of the USA. This
was based on modelling for various levels of airtightness of the
dwelling stock to predict resultant energy consumption while still
meeting ventilation requirements. On a connected subject, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n50" >Don Stevens
</A> (Stevens and Associates, USA) identified the evolution of
ventilation in manufactured housing in the north-western United
States. The findings from a measurement survey of the indoor air
quality of 30 houses with distributed heating systems in Quebec
were given by <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n21" >Denis Parent</A> (Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec,
Canada). He concluded that during the milder part of the heating
season only the minority of the tested houses had adequate ventilation,
with an improvement during the colder part. Also, there didn't
seem to be a significant correlation between building airtightness
and indoor air quality.
<H4>IEA ECBCS Annex 27</H4>

<P>
Other contributions on dwellings concerned products of the continuing
work of <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex27.html" >IEA ECBCS Annex 27  
</A>&quot;Evaluation and Demonstration of Domestic Ventilation
Systems&quot;. <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n24" >Peter Op't Veld</A>
(Cauberg-Huygen Consulting Engineers, Netherlands) gave an overview
of his assessment of aspects of noise and ventilation systems.
This covered the transmission of outdoor noise, noise generated
by ventilation system components and the impact of a system on
sound transmission in or between dwellings. His work for this
Annex has produced a simplified tool for the selection of ventilation
systems based on the criteria of noise. Also as part of Annex
27, Lars-G&ouml;ran M&aring;nsson (LGM Consult AB, Sweden) outlined
the progress made in developing a simplified tool for evaluating
domestic ventilation systems' ability to provide an acceptable
indoor air quality.
<P>
Multi-zone calculations of air flows and tracer gas measurements
in dwellings were compared by <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n44" >Charlotte Svensson
</A> (J&amp;W Consulting Engineers, Sweden). This forms part of
the Swedish contribution to Annex 27. The study highlighted the
good agreement that can be obtained between measurements and calculations
when the input parameters of the model are consistent with the
experimental configuration. Along similar lines, <A HREF="ra74_1.html#n19" >Jacques Riberon
</A> (<A HREF="http://193.104.99.10/" >CSTB  </A>, France) gave
an account of a comparison of ventilation systems performances
in residential buildings made with the model SIREN.
<H3>Innovative <A NAME="Technologies">Technologies</A></H3>

<P>
Conventionally, air dehumidification has been achieved by refrigerative
systems. However with current environmental concerns, alternative
approaches are being sought. As part of an investigation of dehumidification
by absorption, <A HREF="ra74_2.html#n55" >Jürgen Röben</A> (<A href="http://www.uni-essen.de/" >University of Essen  
</A>, Germany) described a theoretical model of an open cycle
dehumidification process using hygroscopic materials to absorb
the moisture.The Best Poster at the Conference was awarded to
Peter Hansson (<A HREF="http://www.kth.se/index-eng.html" >Royal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Sweden) for his poster, &quot;<A HREF="ra74_2.html#n52" >A technique to improve the performance of displacement ventilation during cold climate conditions
</A>&quot;. He has devised a method of using warm air extracted
at ceiling level to heat cold surfaces and so improve ventilation
efficiency and thermal comfort by reducing downdraught.
