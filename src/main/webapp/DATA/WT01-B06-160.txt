surgeon and professor of orthopedic surgery, developed breast
cancer. She rejected orthodox treatment and cured herself

uses articles in the <I>Journal of the American Medical
Association</I>, the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>
and the respected British medical journal <I>Lancet</I> to
demonstrate the failures of conventional medical approaches
in the treatment of cancer. An excellent video for those

alternative therapies.</P>
