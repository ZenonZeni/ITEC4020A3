<h2>Introduction</h2>

Americans want comfortable, attractive, functional, and durable housing. Yet,
many increasingly find high quality housing beyond their means. Conventional
building methods rely on plentiful resources. With some of these resources
dwindling, housing costs are sky rocketing. The cost of a home includes
materials, construction, financing, taxes, energy consumption, and insurance.
This booklet explores recent attempts to reduce those costs. Construction
techniques discussed in this booklet focus on building resource-efficient and
energy-conserving homes, without sacrificing affordability or quality.<p>

In a cooperative demonstration project between the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the
Navajo Nation, current home designs on the Navajo reservation were evaluated
and recommendations were made to improve quality and lower the costs. The
resulting design utilized straw-bale wall construction.<p>

Straw-bale building is a practical and perhaps under utilized construction
method. Initiated in the United States at the turn of the century, straw-bale
building is showing new merit in today's marketplace. Walls of straw, easily
constructed and structurally sound, promise to take some of the pressure off of
limited forest resources.<p>

Straw is a viable building alternative, plentiful and inexpensive.
Straw-bale buildings boast superinsulated walls (R-50), simple construction,
low costs, and the conversion of an agricultural byproduct into a valued
building material. Properly constructed and maintained, the straw-bale walls,
stucco exterior and plaster interior remain water proof, fire resistant, and
pest free. Because only limited skill is required, a community house-raising
effort can build most of a straw-bale house in a single day. This effort yields
a low-cost, elegant, and energy-efficient living space for the owners, a
graceful addition to the community, and a desirable boost to local farm income.
This booklet offers an in-depth look at one such community house-raising, in
addition to a general overview of straw-bale construction.

<h2>Straw-Bale Construction</h2>

<b>History of Straw Bale Construction</b><br>
People have built homes using straw, grass, or reed throughout history. These
materials were used because they were reliable and easy to obtain. European
houses built of straw or reed are now over two hundred years old. In the United
States, too, people turned to straw houses, particularly after the hay/straw
baler entered common usage in the 1890s. Homesteaders in the northwestern
Nebraska "Sandhills" area, for example, turned to baled-hay construction, in
response to a shortage of trees for lumber. Bale construction was used for
homes, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores.<p>

Nebraska historian Roger L. Welsch writes: <img
src="pict1.gif"align="right"><br>
"It was inevitable that some settler, desperate for a cheap, available building
material, would eventually see the big, solid, hay blocks as a possibility.
Soon, baled hay was indeed a
significant construction material. The bales, about three to four feet long and
one and one-half to two feet square, were stacked like bricks, one bale deep,
with the joints staggered. About half used mortar between the bales; the others
simply rested one bale directly on the other. Four to five wooden rods (in a
few cases iron rods) were driven down through the bales to hold them firmly
together. The roof plate and roof were also fastened to the top bales of the
wall with rods or stakes. The most common roof configuration was some sort of
hipped roof. . . .Window and door frames were set as the walls rose around
them. . . .Walls were left to settle a few months before they were plastered
and the windows installed."<p>

Matts Myhrman and Judy Knox, straw-bale construction consultants, have visited
many of these "Nebraska-type" bale structures, built between 1900 and 1940.
Myhrman rediscovered the area's oldest existing bale building, the Burke
homestead, constructed in 1903 outside Alliance, Nebraska. Although abandoned
in 1956, the Burke homestead continues to successfully withstand Nebraska's
wide temperature swings and blizzard force winds. Long-time Nebraskan Lucille
Cross recalls the hay-bale house of her childhood was so quiet that her family,
not hearing a tornado outside, just sat there playing cards, while the tornado
wrought havoc all around them.<p>

In Wyoming, straw-bale structures have consistently withstood severe weather
and earthquakes. "The earthquake was in the 1970s and it was either 5.3 or
5.8," Chuck Bruner, a resident of one of the houses told The Mother Earth News.
"There wasn't a single crack in the house. You can live in this house
comfortably during the summer. It stays nice and cool. We have never needed any
air conditioning, and in summer we get days up in the 90s. Also, last winter, I
only turned our small bedroom heater on twice. If I had to guess how our
utility bills compare to those of our neighbors, I'd have to say our bill is
about half.<p>

<b>Straw: A Renewable Resource</b><br>
Straw, the stalks remaining after the harvest of grain, is a renewable
resource, grown annually. Each year, 200 million tons of straw are under
utilized or just wasted in this country alone. Wheat, oats, barley, rice, rye,
and flax are all desirable straws for bale walls. Even though the early bale
homes used hay for the bales, hay is not recommended because it is leafy and
easily eaten by creatures great and small. Straw, tough and fibrous, lasts far
longer. Straw-bale expert Matts Myhrman estimates that straw from the harvest
of the United States' major grains could be used to construct five million,
2,000 square-foot houses every year! More conservative figures from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture indicate that America’s farmers annually harvest
enough straw to build about four million, 2,000 square-foot homes each year,
nearly four times the houses currently constructed.<p>

Building a straw-bale house is relatively simple. A basic 2,000 square-foot
house requires about 300 standard three-wire bales of straw (costing
approximately $1,000). Placed on a foundation, the bales are skewered on rebar
pins like giant shiskabobs. After wiring and plumbing, the walls are sealed and
finished. Because grains are grown in almost every region of the country, straw
bales are readily available, with minimal transportation costs. Lumber from
trees, in addition to becoming more scarce and expensive, must be transported
over longer distances.<p>

<h5>TYPES OF STRAW BALES<br>
Straw bales come in all
shapes and sizes, from small
two-string bales to larger
three-string bales and
massive cubical or round
bales. The medium sized
rectangular three-string
bales are preferred for
building construction.
Three-string bales are better
structurally, have higher
R-value, and are often more
compact. A typical medium-sized,
three-wire bale may
be 23" X 16" X 42" and
may weigh from 75 to 85
pounds. The smaller two-wire
bales, which are easier
to handle, are roughly
18" X14" X 36" and weigh
50 to 60 pounds. If the
current trend continues, it
may not be long before
"construction-grade" bales
begin to appear.</h5><p>

<h2>The Navajo Project</h2>

The Navajo Nation (located in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah) is the
largest American Indian reservation in the United States. With a population of
close to 200,000 people spread over 17 million rural acres, the Navajo
community has a continuous need for adequate housing.This need for housing is
complicated by the lack of affordable electricity to remote homesites,
dwindling supplies of firewood, and increasing cost of building materials and
labor. Navajo community leaders wanted housing that boosted the local economy,
used local materials and labor, and maintained the integrity of their
culture.<p>

In 1991, the Navajo Nation asked the DOE for assistance in creating more
energy-efficient, affordable housing. Under the proposal, DOE and HUD provides
funds for technical assistance to review home designs and suggest alternatives,
while the Navajo Nation provide funds for construction of a demonstration
house. A team was assembled in December 1992 to discuss local housing
construction, evaluate design options, identify the needs of home occupants,
and inventory community sentiment. In architectural circles, this process is
known as a "design charrette." Charrette participants were selected for
expertise in energy, finance, indigenous materials, passive solar design, and
knowledge of the Navajo community and traditions. The design charrette was
conducted in Gallup, New Mexico and focused on the following design criteria
for the prototype home:
<img src="pict4.gif"align="right">
<ul>
<li>Energy efficiency;<br>
<li>Affordability;<br>
<li>Resource-efficient building technology;<br>
<li>Use of local materials;<br>
<li>Community involvement and use of local labor;<br>
<li>Cultural compatibility; and<br>
<li>Design simplicity, adaptability, and comfort.</ul><p>

The final design that was agreed upon was a unique combination of
"Nebraska-style" straw-bale walls and adobe walls with passive solar
orientation. This combination has several benefits. Straw-bale and adobe are
inexpensive, locally available materials that can be used for building by
local unskilled labor after only minimal training. Straw-bale walls are
superinsulated (about R-50), and adobe and passive solar orientation have been
used for centuries by Native Americans in the southwest. Because of the
two-foot thick bale walls, the resulting structure has approximately 1,000
square feet of living space.<p>

<center><img src="pict5.gif"align="center"></center><p>

Construction of the demonstration home began in July 1993 near Ganado, Arizona
and was completed in December 1994. The home successfully met the design
criteria in the following ways.<p>

<li><b>Energy Efficiency.</b> The high elevation desert climate of the Navajo
Nation, characterized by wide daily temperature fluctuations, low humidity,
 plentiful sunshine, and cold winters, dictated the design parameters for the
prototype home. Well-insulated walls,
good air-leakage control, and taking advantage of the solar radiation were key
to reducing the use and cost of space heating. Unlike a wood frame wall that
has many pieces assembled at the site, bales provide an nearly monolithic layer
of straw that is covered inside with plaster and outside with stucco. Coupled
with a simple geometric design, the monolithic wall coverings result in very
little air leakage.<p>

Straw is a form of cellulose that has reasonably good insulating properties;
and because a bale can be up to two feet thick, a straw-bale wall has extremely
high thermal resistance. Recent tests following ASTM procedures resulted in
bale R-values between R-2.4 and R-3.0 per inch, depending on the direction of
the straw, and showed that thermal resistance is affected by moisture and
density of the pack (Joseph McCabe, January 1993). Matts Myhrman, another
straw-bale expert, suggests that R-2.4 per inch is representative of straw-bale
thermal resistance in the field. Therefore, straw-bale homes should have lower
heating and cooling costs than conventional homes.<p>

<h5>METHODS OF BUILDING WITH STRAW<br>
Straw has been used for centuries by builders who recognized
its structural integrity. A piece of straw is simply a tube made
of cellulose. Tubes are recognized as one of the strongest
structural shapes. Straw was first used to reinforce mud
against cracking. A lattice of straw criss-crossing a layer of
mud produced a surface that remained crack free for
decades, or in many cases, centuries. With the late 19th
century invention of the baler, builders were given a
convenient new building block,the rectangular bundle of
straw. Straw-bale building in the United States has been
mostly structural (Nebraska-style) and non-structural. Pliny
Fisk III of the Center for Maximum Building Potential in
Austin, Texas, describes the following five methods of
building with straw.<p>

1. In-fill or non-structural bale - This building system, useful
for construction of large structures, depends on a pole or
post-and-beam building design. Post-and-beam construction
employs a skeleton of vertical posts and horizontal beams to
support the roof. The straw-bale walls have only themselves
to support. The bales are attached to each other by piercing
the bales with rebar or bamboo and attaching the bales to
the pole or column. Fisk’s Center has completed three
buildings totaling 4,500 square-feet of space using this
method.<p>

2. Structural bale - Automatic straw balers create tight
building blocks that are stacked up to one and one-half
stories. The "Nebraska-style" buildings originated on the
Great Plains where structural wood was not available. Bales
are stuccoed on the exterior and plastered on the interior to
protect them and provide an attractive finish. The stucco and
plaster add to the structural integrity of the wall system.<p>

3. Straw-clay building - A pancake like batter of clay and
water stirred into the loose straw produces a straw-reinforced
clay mud. In the past, this mixture was packed into a double-sided
wood form between the posts and beams of a timber-frame
building. Today, a light weight wooden ladder like
frame replaces the old heavy timber frame. European heavy
timber structures using this method are still standing after
more than 200 years. This method has passed the most
stringent European fire codes.<p>

4. Mortar bale - Structural mortar, made of portland cement
and sand, is applied between the straw bales. When dry, its
lattice structure remains intact if the straw bales should ever
fail. This method, developed in Canada, passes Canadian
building codes. Bales are stuccoed on the exterior and
plastered on the interior to protect them and provide an
attractive finish. The mortered joints, stucco, and plaster also
add to the structural integrity of the wall system.<p>

5. Pressed straw panels - Straw is compacted under certain
temperatures. The resulting panels are 100 percent straw that
can be used to build pre-fabricated structures, not only walls,
but also roofs and floors.</h5>

The Department of Energy, interested in the magnitude of potential energy
savings of the wall design options, asked building scientist Jim Hanford of
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) to analyze the thermal characteristics of
the various wall materials and project energy savings for the prototype home.
The energy efficiency of various building design options was analyzed during
the design charrette at Navajo and continued to be evaluated during the
construction and testing phases of this project. Hanford's analysis, which
follows, assumes R-2.4 per inch for a straw bale, with sensitivities conducted
at R-1.8 and R-3.0 per inch. Table one compares thermal characteristics of the
straw-bale wall with the other wall constructions considered at the Navajo
design charrette.<pre>

The thermal performance for buildings using these wall constructions is
compared in figures one and two. The data shown are simulation predictions of
building heating and cooling loads per unit of floor area, using the DOE-2
building energy simulation program. The building size, shape, and other
component characteristics are based on the Navajo straw-bale demonstration
house. In the final case, straw-bale construction is combined with passive
solar design. Weather data used in this analysis is from Cedar City, Utah
representing the colder, mountainous areas of the reservation, and Albuquerque,
New Mexico, representing the warmer climates.<p>

<center><img src="pict23.gif"></center><p>

<center><img src="pict24.gif"></center><p>

<b>Notes for Figures 1 and 2:<p><ul>

<li>Prototype building is 1,050 square feet (42 ft. X 25 ft.) with 120 square
feet of windows.
<li>Base house has R-30 roof, R-19 wood frame walls, slab floor with 1 inch
perimeter insulation, double glazed windows with aluminum frames, and medium
infiltration levels (ELF=0.0005; ACH=0.52).
<li>Prototype has equal window area in four cardinal orientations (30 square
feet each).
<li>Prototype has concrete slab floor and wood-frame interior walls.
<li>Albuquerque, New Mexico represents Navajo Reservation climates (4186
heating degree days (HDD) @ 65 degrees F base); Cedar City, Utah represents
colder climates (5918 HDD).</b><p></ul>

The straw-bale wall has the best energy performance because it has the highest
R-value by a wide margin, regardless of the assumed unit R-value for straw. For
the entire building, changes in just the wall construction change the heating
load by plus or minus twenty percent from the R-19 wood frame base case.<p>

The results assume that the building infiltration rate is the same for all wall
systems. All building components, including the roof, floors, windows, doors,
and air infiltration need to be considered in the analysis of an
energy-efficient dwelling.<p>

The design team chose plastered straw-bale walls for their high R-value
(approximately R-50) and adobe walls to absorb and radiate solar gain. The
straw-bale walls face the northwest and join the adobe walls on the north and
east sides of the building, exposing the adobe to the maximum solar radiation,
yet shielding it from the prevailing winter wind. Both the adobe and straw bale
walls are coated with three layers of stucco inside and out for protection.
The attic, windows, and doors of the demonstration home are also
well-insulated and sealed to minimize drafts. The resulting building is
superinsulated, remaining cool on hot summer days and requiring minimal heating
in winter.<p>

Further computer simulations and other research summarized in Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory's forty-page final report show that the program currently undertaken
by the Navajo Nation has the potential to improve the energy efficiency and
thermal comfort of new residences when compared to those currently being built
on the reservation.<p>

LBL analyses show that (1) there are alternative construction technologies that
provide equal or better energy performance than current practice, (2) the
demonstration building, with a few modifications, could be substantially more
energy efficient and comfortable than current practice, while meeting other
program goals of architectural interest and long term environmental
sustainability; and (3) straw-bale construction, along with appropriate
building conservation technologies and simple passive solar design, could
provide up to a 60 percent reduction in building heating loads over current
practice.<p>

<h5>SUMMARY OF LBL'S
FINDINGS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS<br>

<li>Straw-bale building
technology offers the best
energy performance of any
of the new construction
typologies currently being
considered, with 15 percent
improvements in overall
building energy-efficiency in
heating for the climates on
the Navajo reservation.
<li>The wall panel technologies
that were part of this
analysis, either straw or
fibrous concrete, when
insulated with an additional
two inches of polystyrene
insulation, perform about
the same as an R-19 wood
frame wall. Similarly, adobe
should be insulated for
better thermal performance.
<li>Small changes in the
straw-bale/adobe prototype
dwelling, specifically slab
insulation, higher insulation
in the vaulted ceiling, and
either insulating or replacing
the adobe walls with straw
bales, would vastly improve
the performance of this
building.
<li>Energy-related testing of
straw-bale buildings in the
field is warranted.
Infiltration characteristics
and the effects of moisture
on energy performance
need further evaluation.
<li>Future design and building
programs on the Navajo
reservation should consider
using better technologies
for all building components,
including increased roof
insulation, advanced
window features, and
infiltration reduction details.</h5><p>

<li><b>Affordability.</b> The Navajo project has demonstrated that straw-bale
construction can be inexpensive compared to other materials. Table two details
the costs of the project.<p>

The cost of the finished 988 square-foot home equates to $58 per square foot,
not including the cost of utility hookups (water, power, and sewage). A similar
sized wood-frame house constructed in the same area would probably have cost
about the same as the demonstration prototype. However, future straw-bale homes
should cost considerably less than the prototype because of required changes
and modifications during building of the prototype. In addition, the
labor-intensive double adobe walls of the "hearth" area added more than $3,000
to the project. Had the exterior walls been entirely straw-bale, the over-all
costs would have been lower. Straw bales were supplied at a cost of $2.50 a
bale, including transportation. Normally, the cost of a bale wall is about
one-fourth the cost of a comparable, superinsulated wall built with
conventional materials. Construction crews and volunteers with no straw-bale
building experience erected the walls in a single day. Approximately 2,500
labor hours, a portion of which was donated, went into construction of the
prototype house.<p>

<li><b>Resource-Efficient Building Technology.</B> Resource efficiency was one
of the important elements considered during the four-day Navajo design
charrette. For a house to be truly efficient, the energy expended in the
extraction, refinement, and transportation of building materials to the site,
and the total resources used during construction, should also be included in
the calculation of the structure's efficiency. The integration of
resource-efficiency concepts into design, materials, and building practices can
reduce the environmental impacts associated with home construction. In the same
way that the occupant's habits and conservation consciousness affect the home's
operating efficiency, the selection of building materials and techniques also
reflects the resource-efficiency consciousness of the architect, builder, and
homeowner.<p>

These considerations led to the selection of straw bale and adobe as building
materials for the demonstration house at Ganado. Straw bales were available not
far from the building site and adobe blocks were manufactured from soil taken
from the site. Plastered straw-bale building was just one component the
resource-efficient strategy employed in the Navajo demonstration project.
Passive solar design and the use of adobe as the thermal mass were also used to
save energy and lower heating and cooling costs.<p>

<i>Solar Energy.</i> In the Navajo area, the daytime average solar radiation is
1200 Btus per hour during the six winter months and 1800 during the six summer
months. This ample sunshine makes solar energy a good strategy for winter space
heating. Solar heat, however, needs to be controlled during the summer months
to prevent overheating.<p>

At the Navajo demonstration project, the home's design oriented the windows to
use passive solar heating and passive cooling. Due to the width of straw bales,
the windows are naturally shaded from the high, hot summer sun, while the
lower, winter sun is allowed to enter. Most of the passive solar heat is
provided by the wood-frame and glass sunspace on the south side. The concrete
floor and adobe walls within the sunspace provide heat storage of daytime heat
for nighttime use. During winter, solar heat collected in the sunspace is
vented into the home. For back-up heating, the Navajo demonstration home
utilizes a wood pellet stove and two electric baseboard heaters. During summer,
the sunspace is shaded and vented to prevent overheating.<p>

<i>Adobe Walls and Thermal Mass.</i> Adobe and rammed earth construction are
two of the oldest and most commonly used building materials. Adobe has been
used to shelter the Navajo people for centuries and, consequently, was
integrated into the demonstration project. Exterior adobe walls are appropriate
in a desert climate with wide day-to-night temperature swings. Adobe walls
stabilize the home's interior by moderating the indoor effects of high and low
outdoor temperatures. Adobe walls absorb solar heat during the day, and at
night radiate their heat back into the cool night sky leaving the home at a
comfortable temperature. Exterior and interior adobe walls provide excellent
thermal mass. In the Navajo demonstration project, adobe serves as thermal mass
in the common wall between the solar sunspace and main house, and also in
interior house walls.<p>

<h5>BUILDING MATERIALS
FROM THE EARTH<br>
Rocks and soil are the source
of some of natures
strongest, most weatherproof,
and most economical
building materials. Buildings
made of stucco, plaster, and
mortar have survived
centuries. Stucco,
plaster, and mortar
are very similar.
Stucco is a rougher-surfaced
exterior
wall siding.<p>

Plaster, stucco's in-door
cousin, is a smooth
mixture of mostly lime. They
are both mixtures of crushed
rock and sand. The mixture's
most adhesive component is
portland cement, a blend of
pulverized rock.<p>

Lime, which is limestone
crushed to a powder, adds
pliability or spreadability to
the mix. And sand, called the
aggregate, gives the mix
substance. The best aggregates
combine different sizes
of clean, sharp-edged sand.<p>

Mortar, also a mixture of
cement, lime, and sand,
is used in masonry or
plastering.<p>

Adobe is compressed
earth. The best adobes are
high in clay, which is very
fine soil with good cohesion.
The adobe is rammed into
forms or pressed into blocks
while damp, then sun-dried
to form a durable building
material.</h5>

<center><img src="pict9.gif"></center><p>

<li><b>Use of local materials.</b> The Navajo demonstration project utilized
straw bales from the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry, a neighboring
agricultural enterprise. Portland cement and gravel for the foundation were
obtained from a cement batch plant in nearby Chinle. A hydraulic adobe press
formed adobe blocks directly from the building site's soil. This compressed
adobe was used immediately, without curing time. Blocks were dry-stacked,
without mortar, by wetting the top of the previous course of adobe, before
setting the next layer. The walls were then stuccoed.<p>

<li><b>Community involvement and use of local labor.</b> Part of what makes
straw-bale construction so affordable is its ability to effectively utilize
homeowner participation and unskilled labor. Material costs of straw-bale
walls represent less than one-fifth of the cost of a wall system; four-fifths
of the cost of building a wall goes for labor. Owner-builders can achieve great
savings by providing their own labor. For the Navajo demonstration project, the
homeowner contributed ten hours a day assisting with construction. Many
additional hours were donated by friends, family, and other visitors to the
site. Experienced labor was necessary for foundation work, roof framing, and
electrical wiring. The construction manager was the only one at the site who
had had straw-bale building experience; none of the paid or volunteer labor
crew had previous experience with straw-bale construction.<p>

<li><b>Cultural compatibility.</b> The home incorporated aspects of the
traditional Navajo hogan--a six-sided structure with a central hearth built of
timbers and adobe, the main entrance facing east, living or gathering areas to
the south, cooking area on the north, and sleeping area to the west. In the
demonstration home, the main living area or hearth, signifying the traditional
hogan, was surrounded by adobe walls. The straw-bale walls comprised the
bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom, extending the "hogan" into a more conventional
home design. The simplicity of design and the natural materials blended well
into the high southwestern desert landscape. Navajo visitors to the
construction site commented on how much they liked the concept of using
indigenous materials. Although somewhat leary of the new material (straw), they
were amazed at how quickly the walls were raised. Many visitors felt the need
to "pitch-in" and were soon up to their elbows in cement, adobe, and/or
straw.<p>

<li><b>Design simplicity, adaptability, and comfort.</b> The simplicity of the
design of straw-bale and adobe homes has comfort, energy, maintenance, and
adaptability advantages over conventional American homes. A rectangular design
with smooth seamless walls and ceilings minimizes air leakage, which could be
both an energy and comfort problem. The simplicity of design also allows for a
superinsulated shell with few thermal flaws leading to exceptionally stable
indoor temperatures and effective noise exclusion from the outdoors. The design
of simple straw-bale and adobe homes can easily be expanded to include
additional rooms.<p><hr>

<h2>Other Contemporary Straw-Bale Homes</h2>
<img src="pict10.gif" align="right">
Although the straw-bale method has a long history, official recognition of
straw-bale construction is just beginning. In the last decade, modern
straw-bale construction pioneers have braved reluctant contractors and
hesitant local building officials. The result has been a slow, but continuous,
growth in construction of straw-bale houses. Straw-bale dwellings range from
small owner-built units to large, contractor-built luxury homes. Costs vary
from $5 to more than $100 a square-foot depending on a number of variables, as
discussed in the next section. Photos on the opposite page depict the variety
of styles of contemporary straw-bale buildings.<p>

The 1,400 square-foot home of Virginia Carabelli near Santa Fe, New Mexico was
designed by local architect, Ken Figuerado. The Carabelli house cost $60 a
square-foot, which included radiant floor heating, three fireplaces, and other
custom features.<p>

The home of Catherine Wells in Santa Fe, New Mexico, measuring 1,224
square-feet (exterior measurement), was built by Ted Varney at $56 a
square-foot. The width of the straw-bale walls (ranging from 14 inches to to 24
inches) reduces the interior square footage dimensions when compared with the
exterior measurements. The cost includes interior features such as radiant
floor heating supplied by solar panels located on the roof and flooring laid
with tile pavers. The main interior wall was also constructed of straw bales to
increase sound insulation.<p>

The pottery studio of Kate Brown (720 square-feet), in Mimbres, New Mexico,
could be used as a small home. It was owner-built for $12 a square-foot. In
Corrales, New Mexico, the private chapel of Dykeman Vermian, 215 square-feet,
was built by Cadmun Whitty for $18 a square-foot. The chapel is an example of
straw bales used in a pueblo-style building.<p>

The straw-bale home of Mark Hawes is located in the Sangre De Cristo mountains
of northern New Mexico. The house is post-and-beam construction with straw
bales used as fill for the walls. Because it is in a remote location and
off-the-grid, a photovoltaic system provides the electricity. The 1,400
square-foot structure was engineered by DeLapp Engineering of Santa Fe and
built to code in 1992 by Hawes, a building contractor. The interior of the
house contains custom southwestern features that added to the cost, which was
approximately $46 a square-foot.<p>

The first legal building in California constructed primarily of straw bales was
completed in 1992. The Noland project, a 2,500 square-foot ranch headquarters
and residence, is located in the Owens Valley in eastern California. Designed
by architects Ken Haggard and Polly Cooper with Pliny Fisk and built by
contractor Greg McMillan, the passive solar structure used straw bales for the
walls on the north and east sides of the building.<p>

In Arizona, straw-bale construction is steadily increasing. Pima County and the
City of Tucson are expected to adopt straw-bale construction into their
building codes in the near future. The straw-bale demonstration home of Mary
Diamond, approximately 1,200 square-feet (exterior measurement), is in
southeast Arizona. The house is off-the-grid, using photovoltaic power. It has
a wind cooling tower, a composting toilet, and a greywater system. Built for
approximately $50 per square-foot, the demonstration house is open to the
public for overnight visits.<p>

<h2>Affordability</h2>
<b>How Affordable is a Straw-Bale House?</b>
A straw-bale house may cost the same as a conventional wood frame house.
However, there are many factors that can make a straw-bale house less
expensive; and, there are additional benefits to building with straw. According
to a 1982 Housing magazine cost guide, exterior and interior wall systems
comprise approximately 30 percent of the cost of construction for a typical
wood frame, slab on grade house in Albuquerque, New Mexico. With the recent
increases in the costs of materials, particularly lumber, this cost is
presently estimated to be considerably higher. For example, lumber prices rose
70 percent during the last six months of 1993. This hefty increase added
approximately $4,000 to the cost of a typical 2,000 square-foot house.<p>

A 2,000 square-foot straw-bale house requires about 300 standard, three-wire
bales at a cost of approximately $1,000. The cost of a "Nebraska-style"
(structural) bale wall is about one-fourth that of a comparable superinsulated
wall. Of course, there are many other variables that go into building a house
such as the cost of labor, choice of finishes such as siding, roofing,
flooring, and other amenities. Unique to straw-bale construction is the broad
range of costs associated with different levels of quality available to
builders. Table three compares the range of straw-bale construction costs based
on a number of variables.<p><hr>

<h5>*The Last Straw, Spring 1994.  Prices do not include land costs, site
development or utility interface.  Compiled with data from Hofmeister, Kemble,
Macdonald, Perry, and Myhrman.</h5><hr>

The cost of a straw-bale house depends on the size of the building, the cost of
materials including bales, the design of the house, and the amount of
"sweat-equity" donated by the owner and friends. Straw-bale costs range from
fifty cents each when purchased from the fields of Montana to $3.50 to $5.00
for three-wire bales delivered to a site in Arizona. Homes have been built for
as little as $5,000 to well above $200,000. Construction costs range from $5 to
$120 per square-foot. ($53 per square-foot is the national average for
conventional construction.) Straw-bale houses come in a variety of shapes and
sizes from A-frames to tipis to two-story custom homes. Simple, owner-built
structures tend to be less expensive.<p>

Long-lasting, low maintenance building materials and protection from the
elements are key for a long-term, maintenance-free house. Providing proper site
drainage is the most important factor for the home's longevity. If the ground
around the house remains dry and the house is sufficiently maintained, the
life-span could be hundreds of years. The roof is another crucial component.
Leaky roofs damage many homes each year. Steeper roofs constructed of more
permanent roofing materials are preferred. Properly built and maintained,
straw-bale walls can last hundreds of years.<p>

Table four compares the life-cycle costs of a conventional house with a
straw-bale house. The Plastered Straw Bale Working Group (September, 1993)
estimated that the straw-bale homes use half as much energy as conventional
houses do for heating and cooling. This could translate to a savings of several
hundred dollars a year over the life of a home.<p><hr>

<h5>HOW TO BUY A BALE<br>
Straw-bale construction
consultant Judy Knox from
Out on Bale (un)Ltd. raises
the following considerations
about selecting bales.<p>

1. Purchase bales following
the harvest when they
are usually inexpensive and
abundant. Make sure the
bales are stored high
and dry.<p>

2. Obtain the bales from
feed stores and other retail
outlets, wholesale brokers,
or directly from the farmer.
Retail outlets are the easiest
and most expensive sources.
Wholesale brokers offer direct
access to the bale supplier
and often offer commercial
transportation. Dealing
directly with farmers may
give you more say about bale
quality and consistency, but
you will likely have to address
bale transportation.<p>

3. Don't rely on hearsay
concerning the size and condition
of any bales you might
buy. Check out the bales
yourself.<p>

4. Bales must be tightly
tied with durable material
preferably polypropylene
string or baling wire. Avoid
bales tied with traditional
natural fiber baling twine.
When you lift the bale, it
should not twist or sag.<p>

5. Make sure the bales are
uniformly well-compacted.<p>

6. Look for thick, long-stemmed
straw that is mostly
free of seed heads. Wheat,
oats, rye, barley, rice, or flax
are all good.<p>

7. Test most bales to
make sure they have always
been dry. Bale moisture content
should be 14 percent
or less.<p>

8. An ideal bale size proportion
is twice as long as it
is wide. This simplifies maintaining
a running bond in
courses.<p>

9. Try to get bales of
equal size and length. If they
do vary in length (as many
will), lay ten bales end-to-end.
Measure this entire
length. Then, divide by ten.
This is the average bale
length to use for planning.</h5>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Straw-Bale</h2>

This section answers some of the most commonly asked questions about straw-bale
construction.<p>

<b>Will the bales rot?</b> Without adequate safeguards, rot can occur. The most
important safeguard is to buy dry bales. Fungi and mites can live in wet straw,
so it's best to buy the straw when it's dry and keep it dry until it is safely
sealed into the walls. Paint for interior and exterior wall surfaces should be
permeable to water vapor so that moisture doesn't get trapped inside the wall.
Construction design must prevent water from gathering where the first course of
bales meets the foundation. Even if straw bales are plastered, the foundation
upon which the bales rest should be elevated above outside ground level by at
least six inches or more. This protects bales from rain water splashing off the
roof.<p>

<b>Will pests destroy the walls?</b> Straw bales provide fewer havens for pests
such as insects and vermin than conventional wood framing. Once plastered, any
chance of access is eliminated.<p>

<b>Are straw-bale buildings a fire hazard?</b> The National Research Council of
Canada tested plastered straw bales for fire safety and found them to perform
better than conventional building materials. In fact, the plaster surface
withstood temperatures of about 1,850∞ F for two hours before any cracks
developed. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, "The
straw-bales/mortar structure wall has proven to be exceptionally resistant to
fire. The straw bales hold enough air to provide good insulation value, but
because they are compacted firmly, they don't hold enough air to permit
combustion."<p>

<b>Are straw-bale buildings acceptable to my local building code?</b> Most
cities and counties have adopted one of three or four model building codes.
City, county, and state building codes may be different. Straw bale is
acceptable to some codes, and not acceptable to other codes.<p>

<h5>HINTS ON OBTAINING A
PERMIT TO BUILD A
STRAW-BALE HOUSE<br>
If your community has
adopted a building code,
you will need a building
permit before beginning
construction. The local
government's building
official is the community's
designated expert and
enforcer. He or she has the
responsibility of interpreting
the codes, inspecting homes
under construction, and
making exceptions to the
code, if requested. As a first
step, identify local building
officials and code requirements.
<i>Out on Bale (un)Ltd.</i>
recommends the following
steps to help you obtain a
straw-bale house building
permit.<p>

1. Obtain and read a copy
of the current building codes
for your area.<p>

2. Gather as much information
as you can about
straw bale construction.
<i>See page 14 for a list of selected resources.</i><p>

3. Talk with straw-bale
experts and others interested
in straw bale building.<p>

4. Before drawing up specific
house plans, meet with
local building code officials.
If they are not familiar with
straw-bale construction, you
may want to take along a
knowledgeable architect or
builder. Give the building officials
copies of supportive
information; allow them to
digest the information, then
meet with them again. Develop
a rapport with them
during the planning and
building process.<p>

5. Become familiar
enough with the code and
straw bale to be able to discuss
and defend your design
decisions as they relate to
the code. If necessary, you
might suggest a small straw-bale
demonstration structure,
perhaps a small storage
shed. This will allow building
officials to become familiar
with the materials and construction
methods.</h5>

Department of Housing and Urban Development's mission to<br>
make housing more affordable.<p>

Funding for this project was provided by the DOE Office of<br>
