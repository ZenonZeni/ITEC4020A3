We are pleased to announce we have a new policy specialist in CEC's Department of Public Policy.  Mr. Jay McIntire joined us in September and will be focusing on the executive branch, as well as providing updates on important court cases around the country.   Many of you may have met Jay at the recent summer CAN Workshop held in Washington, DC.  Jay comes to us from CEC's Department of Professional Advancement (DPA), where he directed CEC's grant in gifted education.  Prior to that, Jay worked as a special education teacher, as well as a local director of special education in Maine.  He will be splitting his time between DPA and DPP until December when he will move full-time to DPP.  Welcome aboard Jay!<P>
<CENTER><B>CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><U>Appropriations</B></U><P>
Although the Senate was scheduled to vote on its bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education on September 28, Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) pulled the bill after he realized there were not enough votes to end a Democratic filibuster.  Congress will be in recess during the week of October 2nd, with both houses returning on October 10.  We are not sure when -- or <BR>
if -- the Senate will vote on the bill.  <B><I>(NOTE</B></I>: Because of the filibuster, Senator Jeffords did not have the opportunity to offer an amendment to restore education funding.)  <P>
There are several scenarios that could happen over the next few weeks: <B>1)</B> It is possible that the funding for various FY 1996 appropriations bills that have not yet been signed into law, including the Labor/HHS/Ed bill, will be "thrown into one big pot," and then reallocated according to negotiations between Congress and President Clinton.  The compromise then would have to be passed by both houses and signed by the President.  If a reallocation occurs, our message to every member of Congress should be to give additional resources to education programs, including special education, during the negotiation process.  <P>
<B>2)</B>  If, however, the Senate does end up passing the Labor/HHS/Ed appropriations bill as it was passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee, Congress would have to hold a conference to come up with consensus figures.  The Senate bill as currently written would cut education funding overall by over $2 billion for FY 1996.  The bill cuts Title I by almost $700 million, Goals 2000 by $62 million, and Bilingual Education by $34 million.   For special education, the bill would appropriate a total of $3.25 billion, which is $153 million more than was appropriated by the House.  Although the Senate bill would cut $7.4 million overall from the FY 1995 funding level for special education, no support programs were eliminated. <P>
The Senate adopted the House's slight increases in the State and local grant program, Preschool grants, and Early Intervention program, for a total of $3 billion, an increase of $1.12 million for FY 1996.   The bill does, however, cut funding from some of the special purposes programs.  The following would be cut under the Senate bill:  Innovation and Development (-$6.6 million), Technology (-$869,000), Special Studies (-$333,000), Clearinghouses (-$173,000) and RRCs  (-$577,000).   Deaf-Blindness, Serious Emotional Disturbance, Severe Disabilities, Early Childhood Education, Secondary and Transitional Services, Postsecondary Education, Media and Captioning Services, Personnel Development, and Parent Training were frozen at the FY 1995 level under the Senate bill.  The subtotal for the special purposes funds in the Senate bill is $245.45 million for FY 1996.   <P>
The Senate appropriated $3 million for FY 1996 for the Javits gifted program.  This is the same level the House appropriated.  Because both the House and the Senate have proposed the same funding level, the Javits gifted program will probably not be a conference issue.  However, because it is such a small program (and getting smaller!!) it is important to continue to strongly advocate for the need for funding.  As you know, a lot of deals are made in conference and members are looking for funding sources.  See <B>Attachment I</B> for an updated appropriations chart.<BR>
 <BR>
As mentioned above, if the Senate passes its appropriations bill, the House and Senate would have to conference the two bills.  It is of the utmost importance that CEC members continue to contact their Congressional members, especially those who sit on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.  Our message to the members is the 1) importance of special education special purposes programs for training, research, information and technology, and 2) the need for federal involvement in the research and development of gifted programming.  We must convince members to support the higher Senate funding numbers for special education and not simply split the difference between the two houses.  <P>
We will keep you updated on what happens with the appropriations process.  Stay tuned!!!<P>
<CENTER><B>Continuing Resolution Agreed Upon</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The start of the fiscal year begins October 1st.  Without appropriations bills enacted by then (see above), there would be no available funding to continue federal programs.  To extend the "deadline" for pushing the appropriations bill through, Congress and the Administration have agreed on a plan, called a Continuing Resolution (CR), that would enable the continuation of funding for programs until November 13.  The CR would take the average of the House and Senate numbers for each individual program, and then subtract 5% from that average.  Programs such as the Part B State grants that received proposed increases, or have the same funding level in the House and Senate, would also be cut 5% from the proposed FY 1996 funding level.  However, no program can be cut more than 10% from the previous year's (FY 1995) funding level.  This floor will also apply to programs that the House voted to terminate, such as the seven support programs that the House targeted for elimination under IDEA.  <B><U><P>

Reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</B></U><P>
As of early October, neither the House nor the Senate Republicans have introduced a bill to reauthorize IDEA.  The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities is expected to release a second draft bill for comment before introducing the "real thing."  In the Senate, the Subcommittee on Disability Policy is expected to have a draft ready for circulation the week of October 15.  It is unclear whether the House and the Senate will be able to pass legislation this year or will run out of time.    <P>
<B>House Action.  </B>In addition to the release of a draft for Parts A, B, and C (the old Part H), which was described in the last CAN mailing, the House Committee has released a draft of "Part D" that would consolidate the current 14 special purposes programs into one part.  Part D would be divided into three subparts: State Program Improvement Grants for Children with Disabilities (75 percent of funds would have to be used for professional development); Parent Training, Innovation and Research, Evaluations and Professional Development; and General Provisions.  The draft bill requires the same minimum funding for State improvement grants as the Administration's bill, requiring States to receive at least $400,000 each.  The draft also has the same minimum funding requirements as the Administration's bill for addressing the needs of: children who are deaf-blind ($12.8 million), have a serious emotional disturbance ($4.2 million), or have severe disabilities ($10 million) or deafness ($4 million).   For the Parent Training program, States must receive at least $150,000 or the amount that was allocated the previous year, whichever is greater.  Finally, for research and improvement, the House draft authorizes the Secretary to reserve up to 10 percent of the amount appropriated for the Office of Education Research and Improvement (OERI) to carry out these activities but does not require funding.<P>
CEC has voiced concern over the House Committee draft.  While CEC understands current pressure to consolidate Parts C through G of IDEA, CEC believes the House proposal would not meet the goals or purposes of these critical programs.  The funding of the programs also seems to be in jeopardy in the draft language.  CEC is proposing language that would consolidate the 14 programs into four main authorities: <I>Improving Professional Practice for Children with Disabilities and Their Families; Developing Professionals for Children with Disabilities and Their Families; Informing and Assisting Parents, Consumers, and Professionals; and Improving State and Local Service Systems for Children with Disabilities and Their Families, </I>but would include minimum levels for certain groups served under the current authorities.  For CEC's proposal for the consolidation and for specific positions on the House draft of the new Part D program, please see <B>Attachment II</B>.<P>
<B>Senate Action.  </B>The Senate is moving at a slower pace than the House on the reauthorization.  As we mentioned earlier, the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy has not officially released a draft of its proposal for reauthorization.  The first draft is expected to be released in mid-October.  There is, however, language on the discipline issue that is currently being considered by key members of the Senate.  Please see <B>Attachment III</B> for a summary comparison of the Administration's, the House draft, and the Senate draft language on discipline. <P>
To aid your comparison of the different major legislative proposals, as well as what CEC's positions are on each issue, please see <B>Attachment IV</B>.  This document will continue to be updated as more information becomes available. <BR>

<B><U>Welfare Reform</B></U> <P>
After contentious debates and numerous compromises, the Senate passed its welfare reform bill (S. 1120)  on September 19 by a vote of 87-12.  The final version did not include the Workforce Development Act, a consolidation of over 90 job training and education programs that includes the Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.  The Act had been briefly attached and could have resulted in funding for vocational education being used to shore up job training in welfare programs.  The education community strongly advocated separating the Workforce Development Act from the larger welfare reform package and was pleased when the provisions were dropped from the bill.  <P>
On the Senate floor, an amendment passed that would increase the funds available for child care.  Also passed was an amendment that would authorize $10 million over five years for demonstration projects that establish community-based learning centers in schools. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill does not prohibit increased benefits for mothers receiving assistance who have additional children or cash benefits to unwed teenagers.   Provisions on child nutrition and on the SSI program for children with disabilities remained the same (see the last CAN mailing).  The bill will now be conferenced with the House version, which passed in March.    <BR>
<B><BR>
<U>Vocational Education</U><P>
</B>On September 19, the House passed the Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act (CAREERS) by a vote of 345-79.  The bill would consolidate more than 100 programs into block grants for youth workforce development, adult literacy, and dislocated workers.  On the House floor, an amendment by Representative Gene Green (D-TX) to delete the provisions in the bill relating to vocational rehabilitation was successful.  Although one of four separate block grants in the CAREERS consolidation, many in the disability community were concerned about vocational rehabilitation remaining a part of a larger consolidation bill and the changes in the system that were proposed.  The Senate Workforce Development Act continues to have vocational rehabilitation provisions.<P>
Now that the Senate bill, S. 143, has been separated from welfare reform, it is expected to be debated on its own in mid-October.<P>

</CENTER><BR>
CEC's Clarissa Hug Teacher of the Year, Brenda Robbins, was in town on September 18 and 19 to meet with key Department of Education officials and Congressional members.  A music therapist from Tallahassee, Florida, Brenda was able to educate and inspire U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley, William Frist, who is Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy, and others, on the needs of children with exceptionalities.  The Department of Public Policy was honored to showcase such a great advocate for children!<BR>

<CENTER><B>RECENT COURT CASES</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><BR>
What happens to special education students when a school district runs out of money and closes early?  </B>Last year, all schools in the District of Columbia were closed early due to a fiscal crisis.  Some private providers of services to special education students were notified that the District of Columbia school system would no longer pay tuition or provide transportation after June 9, 1995.  The district argued that, since <U>all</U> district students' school years were being shortened, students with disabilities were receiving equal treatment. The district court ruled that the district's action violated IDEA by making a unilateral change in a child's placement without proper procedural safeguards and by illegally shortening the student's school year without considering the unique needs of the students involved.  The court ruled that (a) once the IEP is developed, the school is required to provide an education that meets the needs of the student as spelled out in the IEP, and (b) the district entered into contracts or other agreements with outside providers and that the district was obligated to pay for those services. The school district was ordered to fund placements and related services until the conclusion of the school year and make full payment within 14 days.  <I>Petties, et al v. District of Columbia, et al: 22 IDELR 853</I><P>
<B>Can a special education student receive a FAPE while on suspension?</B>  The U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Alabama ruled that a school did NOT violate a student's right to FAPE by failing to offer special education services during a short-term suspension (5 days), even though the suspension was due to misconduct related to the child's disability.  The court found that the IEP in place was adequate, that the suspension satisfied the purposes of punishing the student and serving as a notice to other students, and that the school system had a right and obligation to follow its disciplinary code.  <P>
It was ruled that (a) the existing IEP <B>did</B> provide an opportunity for the student to benefit meaningfully from his educational experience, and (b) the out-of-school suspension <B>did not</B> deny the student the opportunity to benefit meaningfully from his public education.  If either of these had not been the case, the defendants may have been found guilty of denying FAPE.  <I>Eric J. v. Huntsville City Board of Education: 22 IDELR 858<BR>

<CENTER><B>IN THE WHITE HOUSE</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
On September 11, President Clinton wrote an open letter to the students of the United States.  In it, he criticizes the "drastic cuts" in education being proposed by "the Congressional majority."  Mr. Clinton claims that his balanced budget plan would achieve the same aim as the Republican plan, but would take more time and would continue the Federal commitment to fund scholarships, student loans, national service, preserve the environment, and provide Medicare.  President Clinton claims that his plan would eliminate both the budget deficit and the education deficit by balancing the Federal budget in seven years while increasing the Federal investment in education by $40 billion over the same period.<P>
<B>Other issues being tracked by DPP</B>:<BR>
The proposed cuts in Medicaid could have profound effects upon children and adults with disabilities.  Look for more on this issue as it develops!<BR>

<B><U>8 Student CAN Coordinators Named!!</B></U><P>
As many of you know, we're trying to get our Student CEC members much more involved in all CEC activities, including grassroots advocacy.  In our ongoing attempts to have a Student CEC CAN Coordinator in each state that there is a student Association (there are currently 30 active Associations), we now have 8 that have agreed to be Student Coordinators!!!  They represent: Texas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and CCBD.  <P>
We need your help to make sure that all other states (and divisions) with Student Associations identify and establish a Student CEC Coordinator.  If you received a letter from Jacki Bootel during the summer, please follow-up by contacting your state's Association President.  The students are willing and eager to get involved in the political process, if only someone would ask them!!  If you have any questions, contact Jacki at the Department of Public Policy, (703) 264-9437.<P>
<B><U>New Way to Send E-Mail to Congressmen!!!</B></U><P>
We thought that those of you who have access to e-mail over the Internet might find the following service interesting.<P>
This is a notice about a new service that the group Justice for All is providing.  IMPORTANT: Please read the entire message before using this service!!<P>
<CENTER>Justice For All<BR>
justice@tnet.com<BR>
</CENTER><BR>
According to this new disability advocacy group,  "We're pleased to announce a new and improved way to e-mail Senators and Representatives.  Thanks to a generous donor we have expanded our hardware to keep up with the huge volume of messages that this service generates.  It's a wonderful tool for Justice For All subscribers to use to educate Congress on our issues."<P>
<B>CONGRESSIONAL MAILBOT SERVICE</B><BR>
This service is provided to make it easy for you to get your message to all members of the House or Senate that have e-mail addresses.  By sending a single message to the service addressed to HOUSE@MAILBOT.COM and/or SENATE@MAILBOT.COM, your single message will be expanded and resent to all members of those specified houses as if YOU had e-mailed each and every one of them yourself!!<P>
Any e-mail responses to your inquiries will be sent directly back to your own e-mail address.<P>
--> WHERE DO I SEND MY E-MAIL TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?<BR>
     In order to use this service, you need to address your e-mail to one or both of the<BR>
     addresses listed below.<BR>
FOR MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE: House@Mailbot.com<BR>
FOR MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE: Senate @Mailbot.com<P>
--> WHO WILL RECEIVE THIS E-MAIL?<BR>
     Your incoming message is sent to all currently known members of Congress that have <BR>
     e-mail addresses.  The Congressional Mailbot System updates its list of members of both<BR>
     houses every 30 days.  At that time, new e-mail addresses are added to the Mailbot<BR>
     Server.<P>
--> WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?<BR>
     Most members of Congress do not have the staff to deal with replies via both regular mail<BR>
     and e-mail.  Most would prefer to reply to your specific request by way of regular postal<BR>
     mail.  In order for them to do that, you need to include your NAME, ADDRESS, CITY &<BR>
     STATE so that they can send you a response.<P>
--> WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?<BR>
     Basically, your message should be short and to the point.  It is not wise to include large<BR>
     amounts of text from other sources.  If you want to point out to them about such sources,<BR>
     simply tell them where you saw it.  Imagine getting hundreds of e-mail messages<BR>
     containing the same material over and over!!  The meaning gets lost.  Make your message<BR>
     clear and easy to read.<P>
<B>!WARNING!</B>  Each member of the House or Senate which receives a message from you will result in A LOT OF E-MAIL INTO YOUR MAILBOX!!<P>
If for example, at the time you send your request to the Mailbot, there are 99 members of the specific Body (either the House or Senate) you select that have e-mail addresses, you will get back 99 reply messages from those members when they receive your message.  Currently, the automatic replies are about 750 bytes in size and only contain a header with no message body.  These replies are sent to let you know that the Congress person you sent the message to has received it in their e-mail box.  Some users use systems that only allow so much e-mail per month for free, and then charge for e-mail sent/received after that!!!<P>
IF YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN YOUR MAILBOX, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!<P>
--> WHAT IF I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO A SPECIFIC CONGRESS PERSON?<BR>
     Then,<B> you should not use this service!!</B>  This service is for e-mail intended for ALL<BR>
     members of the House and/or Senate.  Individual messages to specific Congress persons<BR>
     should be sent by other means.<P>
--> LIMITATIONS:<BR>
     This is a very popular tool...Several rules need to be enforced to ensure that this service<BR>
     does not overburden the systems that are connected to it.  The following rules are in<BR>
     place:<P>
&iuml;     The Mailbot will reject any message that is larger than 5,000 bytes in size.  This provides you with a total of 66 lines of 80 columns per line for your message, which is a whole page of information to make your point.<BR>
&iuml;     Please limit usage of the Mailbot to no more than one message per 72-hour period (one each to House and Senate is OK).<BR>
&iuml;     Abusive and obscene messages violate the purpose and spirit of this service and WILL place the originator of such messages on a rejection list. <BR>
<BR>
Users who cannot abide by the above limitations will be placed permanently on a rejection list and all further attempts to use the service will result in that user's messages being rejected by the service.<P>
--> PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS?     <BR>
     If you have any problems or questions about this service, please direct them to the<BR>
     following e-mail address: Mailbot@Mailbot.com<P>

--> TELL A FRIEND??<BR>
     If you should tell a friend or colleague about this service, PLEASE INCLUDE THIS<BR>
     MESSAGE.  This will save them time in knowing what is permitted and will keep<BR>
     questions about the service down to a minimum.  <P>
