From the Desk of <B>Kati Marton</B><P>

<BR>
Dear Colleague:<P>

During my two decades in journalism, I&#146;ve worked as a correspondent on many important international stories and have seen the dangers that journalists face on a daily basis. Since the end of the Cold War, with the eruption of ethnic conflicts around the world, journalism has become a far more dangerous profession.<B> Homicide is now the leading cause of job-related death for reporters, editors and broadcasters around the world.</B><P>

As a young child growing up in Communist-ruled Budapest, I witnessed the arrest of my mother and father who worked as correspondents for United Press International and the Associated Press, respectively. In retaliation for doing their jobs, they were falsely charged with being CIA agents and sentenced to long prison terms.<P>

I have therefore never taken for granted the right of reporters to cover the news "without fear or favor." As a foreign correspondent covering stories from southern Africa to the Middle East, I witnessed firsthand the dangers routinely faced by our colleagues. Like many of us, I left these assignments wishing that we could do more for those who face daily peril.<P>

Now we can.<P>

I am appealing to you as a colleague to<B> help the Committee to Protect Journalists continue to fight for the rights of beleaguered journalists everywhere.</B> By becoming a member today, you&#146;ll play an important role in protecting press freedom and the right of journalists to freely report the news.<P>

Since 1981, CPJ has been defending the rights of journalists. It&#146;s an important mission. Attempts to suppress their freedom have grown more brazen‹and more deadly. <B>CPJ has documented that</B> <B>since 1986, more than 300 journalists have been murdered as a direct consequence of their work‹in 1995 alone, 45 were assassinated.</B> In all these cases, we are actively pressuring governments to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Sometimes, of course, the governments themselves are responsible.<P>

CPJ is an organization that is committed to the freedoms that we cherish as American journalists. <B>The Committee investigates more than a thousand attacks on the press each year and works to make sure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.</B><P>

Here are two recent examples of CPJ at work:<P>
<ul>
<li><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../news/zam3.13.html">Fred M&#146;membe,</A> editor of Zambia&#146;s leading independent newspaper <I>The Post</I>, is facing a barrage of sedition and criminal libel suits for his criticism of President Frederick Chiluba&#146;s government. <P>

When he was arrested and placed in a maximum security prison for several weeks between February and March 1996, CPJ inundated officials in Lusaka with letters protesting M&#146;membe&#146;s detention and alerted the news media to his situation. <P>

<B>After his release, M&#146;membe told CPJ that without the international outcry he could very easily have "disappeared" from his cell without anyone noticing.<BR>
</B><BR>
<li>In October 1995, in retaliation for his reporting on Bosnian Serb atrocities, <I>Christian Science Monitor</I> reporter <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../pubs/newsletter/fall1995/rohde.html">David Rohde</A> was tried and convicted by the Bosnian Serbs of illegally entering Bosnian Serb territory and of falsifying documents.<P>

<B>On behalf of CPJ, I held several meetings with Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic at the Dayton peace talks</B>. I urged him "to work with his Bosnian Serb colleagues to bring this situation to a positive end."<P>

Our efforts were instrumental in securing Rohde&#146;s release a few days later.<P>

<B>It doesn&#146;t always work that way.<BR>
</B><BR>
Journalists are being jailed in record numbers. And when they are murdered--even in the United States--the crimes are usually never solved.<P>

Most people believe that journalists who get in trouble just happen to be in harm&#146;s way while covering a story. <B>The truth is that journalists are threatened, physically assaulted and targeted for political assassination in a direct attempt to control how the news is reported.<BR>
</B><BR>
Pro-government death squads in Turkey have murdered journalists sympathetic to the Kurdish opposition. Crime reporters in Russia are routinely intimidated by organized crime thugs and corrupt officials. And in Algeria, journalists are regularly hunted down by religious extremists who are determined to eliminate any secular voice in the country.<P>

<B>These crimes are not just attacks on the press, they are an attack on all freedoms.<BR>
</B><BR>
That&#146;s why we need you to join the Committee to Protect Journalists. To maintain its independence, CPJ does not accept government funding. We rely entirely on your support. Your <B>tax-deductible</B> contribution will help the Committee continue to investigate attacks against journalists, no matter where they happen and without regard to political ideology.<P>

We&#146;ll continue to keep the journalism community informed about these problems by publishing our findings in our member newsletter, in special investigative reports and on the Internet.<P>

We&#146;ll also stay in contact with reporters who cover the media business, international affairs and human rights to raise awareness about how restrictions on press freedom and attacks on journalists adversely affect the coverage of all important stories.<P>

<B>Your CPJ membership means that you are committed to the struggle for freedom of the press and for the safety of journalists everywhere. It also means that CPJ can continue working to make sure that these ideals are upheld around the world.<BR>
</B><BR>
On behalf of CPJ and your colleagues who have been persecuted for reporting the news, thank you for supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists.<P>

Sincerely,<P>

Kati Marton<BR>
Chair, Board of Directors<BR>
