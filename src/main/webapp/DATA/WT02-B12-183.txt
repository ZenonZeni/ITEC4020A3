Hong Kong and China</h2>

<ul>


<p>

After the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, the UK adopted the British

Nationality Selection Scheme to anchor 50,000 key people and their families in

Hong Kong, a total of 135,000, by granting them British nationality.  There are

fears that the sensitive list of those receiving British passports has been

leaked to China.<p>

China regards the holders of British passports obtained under a special

scheme as dual citizens and therefore not entitled to full consular protection

in Hong Kong.<p>

There is speculation about what will happen to Hong Kong residents living

outside Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.  Under Chinese guidelines, permanent

residents who emigrate and acquire foreign nationality can retain their right

of abode and access to foreign consular protection if they return and settle in

Hong Kong before July 1, 1997. <p>

British officials have asked China to assure Hong Kong residents who are

overseas that they do not have to be in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 to preserve

their residence rights.  If China does not grant this assurance, British

officials warn that there could be a rush by overseas Hong Kong people to the

territory on the eve of the handover.<p>

Emigration from Hong Kong is at its lowest level since the Tiananmen Square

massacre of June 1989.  A survey of five countries that have been magnets for

Hong Kong &eacute;migr&eacute;s found that only Australia has had any

significant increase in arrivals in 1996 over 1995.  <p>

The estimate of migration to Canada this year was 18,800 compared with

19,000 last year and 32,600 in 1994, the survey said, quoting from figures

provided by immigration lawyers.  Immigration visas issued by the United States

totaled 8,641 in the January-November period this year, compared with 11,018

last year and 11,000 in 1994.<p>

Immigration analysts warn that the figures are deceptive because most of

the would-be emigrants left the territory in the early 1990s, following the

Tainanmen Square crackdown.  Many are now returning to Hong Kong because they

have completed residency requirements abroad.  With a foreign passport in case

of an emergency, Hong Kong emigrants feel safer about returning to Hong Kong.

<p>

About 150 immigrants from China arrive in Hong Kong every day, 70 per cent

come from Guangdong and 15 per cent from Fujian, as do 142,000 other entrants.

About 60 illegal aliens are apprehended daily, down from 80 daily in 1995.

<p>

Hong Kong police report that the number of illegal immigrants from China to

the territory declined 13 percent in the first 11 months of 1996.  The police

also report that the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants has

declined by 30 percent over the same period.   <p>

After July 1, 1997, China plans to continue customs and immigration

controls on persons entering Hong Kong from China.  Hong Kong's immigration

office currently has 5,700 officers.<p>

China has announced that the 139,000 Filipino workers in Hong Kong will be

allowed to remain after Hong Kong reverts from British to Chinese rule on

midnight of June 30, 1997.  There are 32,000 British nationals in Hong Kong and

their employers will have to prove to local authorities that they cannot find

local workers if they want to receive work permits after July 1, 1997.<p>

In December 1996, there were 11,000 Vietnamese in camps in Hong

Kong.<p>

About 6.3 million people live in Hong Kong and Hong Kong attracted almost

12 million tourists in 1997.<p>

Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, gave 906 migrant families 15

days to return to their villages of origin because they has too many children.

The city revoked their work permits and ordered housing authorities to stop

renting them housing.  Local residents often refer to migrants as "outsiders"

and blame them for crime and congestion.<p>

"Hong Kong, China police discuss cooperation, crime situation," BBC,

December 20, 1996. "Hong Kong emigration hits lowest level since Tiananmen

massacre," Agence France Presse, December 15, 1996.<p>
