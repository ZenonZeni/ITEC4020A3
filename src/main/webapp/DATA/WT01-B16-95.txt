<H3>The Prospects for Nuclear Power. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/hawlbio.html">Robert Hawley</A>.</H3>
<P>
The perception of nuclear power's prospects in 1975 is reviewed: world reliance on oil, gas and
coal was decreasing due to market volatility and countries were turning to nuclear as having stable
and competitive prices and technological maturity. Between 1975 and 1992, total electricity
generated worldwide on an annual basis increased by 84%, the proportion generated by nuclear
by almost 500%. <P>

At present nuclear supplies around 7% of world primary energy by meeting around 17% of world
electricity demand. In 1994 432 nuclear reactors were operating in 32 countries, generating over
2100 TWh of electricity. Nuclear provides over half the electricity demand of Sweden, Belgium,
France and Lithuania, and over one third of that of the European Union. Rapid growth in nuclear
capacity now centres not in the West but in the Pacific Rim countries. Seventy-six plants operate
in this area, with 21 more under construction, six planned and 35 proposed. When these are
finished the area will have more nuclear plants than the USA.<P>

Environmental issues such as global warming, acid rain and the ozone layer holes are likely to
influence energy decisions for the future. However, forecast population increases in the
developing world in the next few decades will bring rapidly increasing energy demand, which will
probably be met by burning fossil fuels, leading to increased CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions.
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that without controls on greenhouse gas
emissions, global mean temperatures will increase by 0.3&#186;C per decade over the next
century, raising sea levels by 20 - 65 cm. The IEA's World Energy Outlook predicts that world
demand for primary energy will grow by 50% from 1991 to 2010, driven by world GDP growth
of 70%; that primary energy demand outside OECD will more than double by 2010; that fossil
fuels will continue the predominant energy sources; that world carbon emissions will rise by 50%
by 2010: and that any international initiative to reduce CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions
 that is not adopted by non-OECD countries will have little impact.<P>

Nuclear, to play its part in reducing CO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB> emissions, must overcome
 adverse public perceptions
associated with waste management, decommissioning plant, and safety standards. It must
demonstrate its favourable track record for safety compared with other sections of the energy
industry, and convince the public of nuclear's environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness.
International development and collaboration must continue, allowing nuclear to be brought to less
developed countries. Environmental concerns offer good prospects for the future of nuclear
provided that the industry continues its efforts to demonstrate its desirablilty to the public.<P>
