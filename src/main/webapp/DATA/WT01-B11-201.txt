<B>North American Award for Ontario Conservation Officers
</B>

</CENTER><P>

Two Ontario Conservation Officers have received the prestigious Shikar-Safari International Wildlife Officer of the Year Award for outstanding achievements in wildlife conservation in Ontario.<P>

The award recognizes Conservation Officers James A. Abbott, Timmins District, and David Arbour, Kemptville District, for their accomplishments in dealing with crimes against wildlife through the Crime Stoppers Program in Ontario.<P>

"I congratulate Jim Abbott and Dave Arbour for their excellent work with Crime Stoppers," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "They have contributed greatly to our goal of protecting Ontario's wildlife."<P>

The two Conservation Officers have been working jointly since 1991, actively promoting Crime Stoppers in their respective areas and across the province. In 1994, the two were invited to join the Ontario Advisory Board (OAB) of Crime Stoppers as MNR provincial representatives.<P>

"Through its association with Crime Stoppers, MNR has entered a new era of community-based law enforcement," said Mr. Abbott.  "Increased public participation over the last five years has resulted in a more effective approach by the ministry to crimes against wildlife."<P>

"We have received tremendous response from all stakeholders," said Mr. Arbour.  
"We want to acknowledge members of the community at large for their enthusiastic participation from the very start.  We also thank our superiors and colleagues in MNR for their continued support." <P>

Crime Stoppers is a non-profit organization relying solely on community support such as fund-raising.  The program receives no government funding.<P>

Based on a partnership between the community, media, law-enforcement agencies, and members of the public, Crime Stoppers invites anyone with information on a crime to report it to the local program.  If the information leads to an arrest, the caller is eligible for a reward while being ensured of complete anonymity.<P>
