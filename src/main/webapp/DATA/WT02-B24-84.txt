<h2><i>Self-identification, Self-advocacy, and Civil 
Rights in Employment and Postsecondary 
Education</i></h2>

<p>Having a learning disability means you <i>have a 
disability.</i> This simple concept is one that is often missed 
by many of those involved in the learning disability field, 
including those with learning disabilities themselves This lack 
of connection to the concept of disability as part of the 
learning disability condition leads to the failure of many to 
access those key elements that allow persons with learning 
disabilities to succeed - civil rights protection and the right 
to reasonable accommodations. However. even if persons are 
knowledgeable about their disabilities and are knowledgeable 
about their rights, the issues of <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> - 
and even <i>whether or not</i> to use the civil rights 
protections offered by the law are an ongoing debate. It often 
comes down to the question of <i>to tell or not to tell</i>, and 
if you do tell, <i>when</i> is the right time.    

<p>Every major civil rights law concerning persons with 
disabilities, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), recognizes 
individuals with learning disabilities as persons entitled to 
those unique civil rights protections given to persons with all 
other disabilities. IDEA insures a free, appropriate, public 
education (FAPE) in grades K-12.

<p>There are certification and qualification obstacles to gaining 
access to civil rights as persons with disabilities. Because 
disability laws are civil rights laws, they do not require 
substantial changes in standards for either educational or 
employment settings. The laws state that a <i>qualified 
individual with a disability</i> is someone who, with or without 
a <i>reasonable accommodation</i>, can do the work or perform 
<i>the essential function of the employment position</i>. To be 
covered by civil rights protection, an individual with learning 
disabilities must be able to perform the work required for the 
particular job or position. If a person cannot perform the 
<i>essential functions</i> of the job, even with reasonable 
accommodations, there is no discrimination in either failing to 
hire or in firing a person.

Disability laws forbid employers or educational institutions from 
asking, as part of their interview process, if a person has a 
disability. It is therefore up to the person to <i>self-
identify</i> in order to be guaranteed protection under the law. 
No program, educational setting, or employer is required to 
provide accommodations unless the persons with disabilities state 
that they have a disability and provide documentation to verify 
that declaration. Persons with disabilities should also be able 
to identify the accommodations necessary for them to perform the 
tasks required for that job or educational program.  

Because individuals with learning disabilities and/or their 
parents are responsible for self-identification in order to be 
protected under civil rights laws, they must:
<ul>
  <li>know that they have learning disabilities and have 
written documentation of their disability
  <li>be knowledgeable of the laws
  <li>know that they qualify for protection under the laws
  <li>know what accommodations they will need
  <li>take the risk to self-identify, and
  <li>face a wide range of uncertainties.
</ul>

<p>For many individuals with learning disabilities, the 
identification issue becomes a life-long concern and debate. The 
debate focuses on whether it is worthwhile to identity oneself as 
a person with a learning disability or to try to do the best one 
can without accommodations.

<p>Central to the debate, <i>to tell or not to tell</i>, is the 
lack of knowledge and understanding of learning disabilities by 
the general public. The terms <i>learning disabilities</i> and 
<i>mental retardation</i> are too often interchanged. The 
continuing disagreement within the learning disability community 
itself concerning the causes, identification, impact, effects, 
etc. of learning disabilities further impedes understanding by 
the general public.

<p>Perhaps the more important question an individual with 
learning disabilities must ask is not whether <i>to tell or not 
to tell</i>, but rather the consequences of <i>not</i> telling. 
Can the person with learning disabilities do the job or derive 
benefit from a postsecondary educational program without 
accommodations? If the answer is no, the individual with learning 
disabilities (the parent, advocate, etc.) needs to consider the 
following:
<ul>
  <li>How severe is the learning disability?
  <li>How much does the nature or manifestation of the 
disability conflict with the needs of the job or educational 
program?
  <li>How open is the employer or educational program to 
recognizing and accommodating individuals with learning 
disabilities?
  <li>If there is a union in the workplace, what is its 
position toward and willingness to support members with 
learning disabilities?
</ul>

<p>Persons with learning disabilities need to be informed 
consumers and effective self-advocates. The skills of consumerism 
and advocacy need to be incorporated into the high school 
curriculum. Organizations such as LDA can serve as resources for 
students and adults with learning disabilities, their parents, 
and advocates and for schools and employers as well.

<p>IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and ADA can open doors 
to persons with learning disabilities. Civil rights laws make 
discrimination illegal; however, individuals must ask for 
protection under the laws through self-identification. With 
self-disclosure, one seeks implementation of the laws. Without 
implementation, civil rights laws are meaningless.
