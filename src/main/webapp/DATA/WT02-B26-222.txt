<B>Problem/Opportunity </B>
<P>
Using vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline is one way to displace imported petroleum and reduce exhaust emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) that contribute to air pollution and global warming.  Federal law requires that alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) be included in government automobile fleets beginning in 1993, in state and fuel provider fleets in 1996, and potentially in municipal and private fleets beginning in 1999.  There are numerous types of AFVs from which fleet owners may choose.  The difficulty lies in knowing which will best meet the owner's needs.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach </B>
<P>
To help fleet owners decide which vehicles to buy, Argonne National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are building a database of information on AFVs.  The information in the database is collected in moving laboratories - the test vehicles Argonne employees drive at the laboratory's Illinois site.  With 60 vehicles, Argonne's Center for Transportation Research (CTR) is the nation's largest alternative-fuel fleet demonstration center and the only one with all models of OEM-produced vehicles.  Argonne employees use the AFVs in their daily work, which is as varied as hauling equipment and driving to meetings.  Thus, the information is collected under real-life operating conditions.  The information gathered about the daily performance of these vehicles aids not only federal agencies that will purchase these types of vehicles,  but car makers and others as well.

Argonne's fleet includes vehicles powered by methanol (alcohol derived from natural gas or biomass), ethanol (alcohol made from grain or biomass), and natural gas.  The alcohol-fuel vehicles are flexible-fuel vehicles that can use any mix of gasoline and alcohol without modifications.  Because the alternative fuels are available on site, the vehicles primarily use alternative fuels.
<P>
Argonne's alternative-fuels fleet includes mid- and full-sized sedans, burning either ethanol or methanol, and vans using natural gas.  Gasoline-powered vehicles of the same type are used to gather comparison data.  Argonne's approach is unique in that the data are collected on a trip-by-trip basis, so that performance over the entire driving cycle can be examined. Thus, researchers can capture the differences between performance on 10 short trips as opposed to one longer one with the same total mileage.
<P>
Data collection focuses on the vehicles' driveability, reliability, and fuel efficiency, but other operational characteristics peculiar to AFVs are also being observed and documented.  Argonne is analyzing additional information on performance, driveability, and emissions for a more precise evaluation of how various vehicles and types of fuels perform in different kinds of weather.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
Since the experiment began in August 1992, over 280,000 miles have been accumulated.  In an earlier study begun in 1986 and concluded in 1991, Argonne drivers logged more than 1 million miles in dedicated methanol-fueled vehicles. Information from the experiment is available to researchers on the Alternative Fuels Center database.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans </B>
<P>
Additional alternative-fuel vehicles will be added as they come into the federal fleet.  Three methanol-calibrated, flexible-fuel Dodge Intrepids were added in spring 1995, including one designated to use E85 (85% ethanol and 15% hydrocarbons), an Argonne exclusive.  In a research partnership based on the CTR's acknowledged leadership in AFV testing, Chrysler engineers are allowing a special field test of some Intrepids using E85.
