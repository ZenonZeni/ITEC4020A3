The Center for Neurobiology and Behavior consists of eleven independent laboratories, including two laboratories of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The overall research goal of the Center is to provide an analysis of neural development, behavior, learning, and diseases of the nervous system in terms of their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The subjects used in these studies range from simple invertebrate animals to humans.

<B>Learning and Memory</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A cross-species approach to understanding the mechanisms of memory and learning has been applied, using two preparations: (1) the defensive gill and siphon withdrawal reflex of the sea hare, Aplysia californica, which undergoes habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning; and (2) the mammalian hippocampus, which exhibits two pronounced types of long-lasting synaptic plasticity that are thought to underly long-term memory-long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). These two complementary approaches have led to a number of fundamental observations concerning the mechanisms that underly learning and memory.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In studies using Aplysia, Dr. Bailey has examined the subcellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of new synaptic connections associated with long-term memory. In collaboration with Dr. Kandel, he has utilized gene transfer and mutation experiments to further define the signaling events responsible for the internalization of cell adhesion molecules during the initial stages of learning-related synaptic growth. Dr. Schwartz has elucidated important new regulatory steps in the ubiquitin pathway that are involved in the acquisition of long-term memory and memory storage processes. In addition, persistent activation of protein kinase C has been shown to be required for intermediate stage memory.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Hawkins has further defined the contributions of mechanosensory sensory cells to plasticity of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia and of cyclic-guanosinemonophosphate to LTP in the hippocampus. Dr. Siegelbaum has identified the mechanism of induction and site of expression of long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the mammalian hippocampus.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To study explicit learning and memory, new strains of transgenic mice have been developed by Dr. Kandel, in collaboration with Stanley McKnight of the University of Washington in Seattle. They have been used to examine the behavioral effects of ablations of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of protein kinase A. This kinase was found to be required for both the early and late phase of LTP in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, but only for the late phase in the CA1 region.

<B>Neural Development</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Schachter has provided evidence that regulation of expression and distribution of a family of cell surface adhesion molecules can regulate cell-cell interactions and synapse formation during the initial establishment of specific connections. The regulation of the same cell surface molecules contributes to the functional and structural changes associated with long-term synaptic plasticity.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Using gene-cloning techniques, Dr. Role has identified a family of genes that contributes to the regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit expression that occurs with innervation in vitro. The gene product thus identified mimics the effects of presynaptic input in increasing the expression of a particular subset of acetylcholine subunit genes and likewise alters the resultant expression of the final acetylcholine receptor.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Ion Channels</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Siegelbaum has proposed a molecular mechanism for the ligand-activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, based on studies using molecular biological techniques to engineer chimeric channels. Dr. Koester has investigated the mechanism and role of frequency-dependent action potential broadening. This phenomenon, which increases both chemical and electrical synaptic transmission, was shown to be caused by the complex interaction of several types of voltage-gated ion channels.

<B>Behavior</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Hen, who joined the Center this year, has determined that genetically engineered mice lacking the serotonin-1B receptor are less responsive to cocaine. These results suggest that the serotonin-1B receptor is mediating some of the reinforcing effects of cocaine. Dr. Qian, another new arrival to the Center, has provided the Center with a new level of expertise in neural modeling. He has recently finished setting up a computational neuroscience and visual psychophysics laboratory, to be used to study the neural mechanisms that underly motion and depth perception.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through studies of human reaching, Dr. Ghez has discovered that distinct sensorimotor transformations are responsible for both specifying and learning handpaths, joint angles, and joint torques. Moreover, he found that joint torque specification is based on short-term learning that requires proprioceptive information. Research performed in collaboration with Dr. Martin on cats points to the intermediate cerebellum as a critical structure for the control and possibly the learning of limb dynamics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an ongoing study of motivated behaviors, using feeding behavior in Aplysia as a model, Dr. Kupfermann has demonstrated extensive and highly specific distributions in the nervous system of chemosensory fibers that have their cell bodies of origin in the periphery. These data suggest a parallel distributed organization of sensory input.
