<h2>Resident continues lifelong mission:</h2>
<h1>Ben Sevack takes case for two-tier taxation to Quebec</h1>
<h4>By Mike Foster<br>
Post Staff</h4>
<p>While some people collect stamps or take up watercolor painting, Melbourne Ave. resident Ben Sevack is doing something a 
little more unusual with his spare time. He has a penchant for examining the inner workings of the taxation system. Mr. Sevack 
has made it his lifelong mission to promote the ideas of Henry George, a 19th Century American economist whose main theory 
centred around establishing a single tax on land values as the sole source of government revenues.</p>
<p>Mr. Sevack, 73, says he became a Georgist about 45 years ago when he took a course in economics at the Henry George 
School of Social Science in Westmount and &quot;saw the light.&quot; While the school is no longer active in Canada because, as Mr. 
Sevack says, people just aren't interested in economic issues, he continues to lobby for a principle which he believes is the 
fairest way to finance the public purse.</p>
<p>Henry George, born in Philadelphia in 1839, published his theories in a book entitled Progress and Poverty in 1879. His 
central theory was that poverty could be eradicated if there was only a single tax on land, and that the market value of that land 
would be determined by the communitv activities around it. The idea is that land and other natural resources, including 
airwaves, should be for the benefit of the people and not a privileged minority, Mr. Sevack says.</p>
<p>&quot;I see more truth in this, more justice, than any other system,&quot; said Mr. Sevack in an interview last Mondav.</p>
<p>And as president of the Canadian Research Committee on Taxation (CRCT), a group he founded in 1964 which examines 
alternative tax policies, he has been as far away as Russia, Australia and Denmark to promote this point of view.</p>
<p>&quot;In Russia, the land was owned by everybody and nobody at the same time&quot; he said, adding that his group and other Georgist 
organizations have made some progress in having the concept that land should be leased rather than sold accepted in the 
former Soviet Union. In Estonia, for example, they have adopted a land value tax of 1.5 per cent, he says.</p>
<p>Closer to home, Mr. Sevack presented a brief to the Quebec Commission on Taxation and the Financing of Public Services 
last month. He used the Town of Mount Royal as a case study to forward the idea that municipalities should have the option of 
setting differential tax rates for the land and the building on real estate valuations.</p>
<p>This concept of two-tier taxation would set a higher mill rate for the land than for the building and this would encourage people 
to renovate and invest in their homes, spurring economic activity, Mr. Sevack says.</p>
<p>&quot;Taxation of the total market value of property inflates overall land costs which in turn take capital away from 
employment-producing investments in construction, renovation and infrastructure development,&quot; states the CRCT brief.</p>
<p>For example, in his case study of TMR, Mr. Sevack suggests a mill rate of $1,77 for every $100 on evaluation of land and 95 
cents on building assessments. This would enable the municipality to raise the same amount of revenue while providing an 
incentive for &quot;business, employment and overall economic activity&quot; he states in the the brief. He says homeowners would pay 
less tax on average. (The current mill rate is at $1.33 per $100 of valuation).</p>
<p>Out of TMR's total valuation of $2 billion, about 43 per cent of that value is land and 57 per cent is buildings, according to the 
brief.</p>
<p>Mr. Sevack says municipalities should be given the right to opt for setting differential rates on land and building through 
individual referendums, as is the case in Australia.</p>
<p>The two-tier system is also in practice in 15 cities in Pennsylvania and studies there show that this caused the number of 
building permits issued to increase, according to an August 1992 edition of the Government Finance Review, a publication 
issued by the U.S. Government Finance Officers Association. The article was referring to a report from the Two Tier Property 
Tax Committee in Peterborough, Ontario.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the two tier property tax is a 'carrot and sticks' approach to enhancing the economic vitality of our communities. The 
carrot, a lower tax on improvements, makes economic growth easier; the stick, a higher tax on land values, makes 
obstructions to economic growth more difficult,&quot; states a summerary in the publication.</p>
<p>Mr. Sevack says that when property values go up, it is the pricing of land that causes the increase He says the current taxation 
sys tem punishes people for working and for spending. And he says higher tax on land would limit speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people call it socialistic but it's not,&quot; said Mr. Sevack. &quot;Wc believe in the open market anc free enterprise. We feel the 
consumer knows how to spend their money better than the government does.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Sevack, who is chairman of, the Mount Royal Muncipal Association's taxation committee is president of Tripar Inc., a 
metal stamping company that manufactures parts for lighting fixtures.</p>
<p>He has been forwarding the idea of two-tier taxation to the MRMA. He notes, for example, that the value of land in TMR 
remained the same with the Montreal Urban Community triennial valuation roll for 1995-'97, even though residential buildings 
decreased in value by an average of about 15 per cent.</p>
<p>The CRCT also presented a report to the Ontario Fair Tax Commission, which wrapped up in December 1993, although he 
says they did not adopt any of the their recommendations. But he says the Quebec commissioners seemed open to his 
presentation. The CRCT has also been active in lobbying against the GST and Mr. Sevack says wherever there's talk about 
tax reform, he'll be there.</p>
<p>&quot;We always keep our eyes open for opportunities,&quot; said Mr. Sevack</p>
