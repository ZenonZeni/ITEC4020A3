ND CA JUDGE APPROVES
SETTLEMENT OF CHRYSLER
MINIVAN CLASS ACTION

     U.S. District Judge Charles A. Legge of the Northern District
of California approved on Nov. 30 the proposed settlement of class
actions involving allegedly defective rear-door latches on Chrysler
Corp. minivans.  The judge held that the settlement was fair,
reasonable and adequate under the law.  Objectors, including seven
individual plaintiffs and the Center for Auto Safety, had called
the agreement a "sham" and will appeal the decision.  Hanlon et al.
v. Chrysler Corp., No. C-95-2010-CAL (ND CA); see Automotive LR,
Dec. 5, 1995.

     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
investigated the alleged propensity of the latches to spring open
during accidents.  While maintaining that no defect existed,
Chrysler agreed in April 1995 to replace the latches on the
4.5 million 1984-1995 minivans in use.

     In June 1995, Chrysler and the plaintiffs in six state class
actions and the California federal case agreed to a settlement
under which Chrysler would make the replacements and spend
$14 million on incentives and an owner-awareness campaign to boost
the response rate if less than 60% of the minivans are repaired
within 18 months.  Plaintiff attorneys will receive $5 million in
fees.

     Additionally, Chrysler will be released from "any and all
claims for consumer damages or equitable relief, arising out of or
related to minivan rear liftgate latches."  Owners would only be
permitted to take legal action for personal injury or wrongful
death.

     In approving the agreement, Judge Legge noted the main
argument made by the Center for Auto Safety -- that the class isn't
getting anything more than what Chrysler already agreed to when it
promised to replace the latches.  "I don't think that's really
fully accurate," the judge held.  "Chrysler had no contractual deal
with NHTSA...now Chrysler has a contractual obligation.  It's going
to have an enforceable judgment against it (and) is going to be
engaged in an outreach program, as I call it. And the speed...is
particularly important here.  I think that in whatever role I may
have in this settlement later, the thing I'm going to keep an eye
on mostly is the speed with which this process gets put forth.

     "I think it's also true that these class actions -- and by
'these class actions' I mean the state actions that ultimately
resulted in the coming together under the tent of this case of a
federal class action -- a least in part, and I think in substantial
part, forced Chrysler into the action it took, and forced Chrysler
into its dealings with NHTSA."

     Judge Legge said, "Even though I accept what some of the
objectors are saying could be done or might be done, that isn't the
deal before me; that isn't my issue.  I have no power to
renegotiate it, don't want to renegotiate it, even if I had the
power, and I think that what is on the table is fair, reasonable
and adequate."

     Should the settlement not go forward, the judge said, state
and federal courts would be confronted with a multitude of separate
suits.  "They could come down with all sorts of balkanized
decisions, at a terrible time and terrible expense, all to what
objective?," Judge Legge held.  "I suppose the objective is that a
few people would get a little more money, but I think that's all
that would be accomplished."

     As to the $5 million in proposed fees for the plaintiff
attorneys, the judge noted that the work done in the state class
actions helped push Chrysler into the agreement.  "Since the
attorneys' work did produce a result, and since there is no adverse
impact to the class on the award of fees, and since the amount of
fees has been agreed to by both sides, and since the amount was
conducted in arm's-length negotiations under the supervision of
(the court), I don't see any reason to substitute my personal
values or personal opinions on what has been done...I think it's
within the realm of reason."

     Class plaintiffs are represented by Richard J. Heimann,
Michael F. Ram and Anthony K. Lee of Crowley, Marks & Douglas in
Houston and Richard Alexander of San Jose, CA.  Chrysler is
represented by Charles A. Newman and Roman P. Wuller of Thompson &
Mitchell in St. Louis; and by Micki S. Singer and Kevin J. Dunne of
Sedgwick, Detert, Moran & Arnold in San Francisco.

     The objectors are represented by Colette G. Mattzie and
Cornish F. Hitchcock of Public Citizen Litigation Group in
Washington, DC; Robert Graham of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington; John R. Gerstein of Ross, Dixon & Masback in
Washington; Michael Rubin of Altshuler & Berzon in San Francisco;
Henry Wiley of Laird & Wiley in Jasper, AL and Mark A. Chavez of
Chavez & Gertler in San Francisco.

11TH CIR. MOVES CASE
FROM WHAT SUZUKI CALLS
ATTORNEY 'HOME' DISTRICT

     In a one-page order Oct. 19, the Eleventh Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals ordered that a Suzuki Samurai stability case be
transferred from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Georgia, in Columbus, to the Southern District court in Brunswick.
Suzuki had argued that no connection existed between the litigation
and Columbus, with the exception that plaintiff attorneys were
based in that city.  In re Suzuki Motor Corp., No. 95-9215 (11th
Cir.).

     The case involves a 1991 collision between a Samurai and
another vehicle, after which the Samurai skidded off the road and
rolled over.  The driver, James Heath, suffered paralyzing
injuries.  His passenger Monica Guinn was killed.  The Guinn family
filed suit in the Brunswick federal court and eventually agreed to
a settlement.  The Heath case was filed in Columbus (Heath v.
Suzuki Motor Corp., No. 4:94-cv-141).

     Suzuki appealed to the 11th Circuit after three unexplained
refusals of the Columbus judge to transfer.  The company argued
that the only connection between the case and Columbus was that the
offices of plaintiff's attorney, James E. Butler, Jr. of Butler,
Wooten, Overby, Cheeley, Pearson & Fryhofer, are located there, and
that the firm is "well-known in the community."

     The defendant noted that the Guinn-Suzuki settlement was not
as favorable to the plaintiffs as Butler has stated, and argued
that Heath might have filed suit in Columbus to avoid a less
favorable forum in Brunswick.

     Suzuki also noted that many witnesses live closer to Brunswick
than to Columbus, with some located in northern Florida where they
could not be subpoenaed unless venue were changed to Brunswick,
which is within the out-of-state subpoena limit of 100 miles.

     In response, Butler claimed, "Suzuki wishes to escape from a
judge who has invested much time and effort in this products
liability action and who has, therefore, become wquite familiar
with the issues."  In a supplemental response to the petition,
Butler said Heath was not forum-shopping and that Suzuki was merely
seeking a delay.

MICHIGAN JURY FINDS NO
DEFECT IN THREE-WHEEL ATV

     A Michigan federal court jury returned a unanimous verdict for
Honda Motor Co. defendants Dec. 7, finding that a 1985 Honda ATC-
125M three-wheel all-terrain vehicle was not defective.  The jury
also found that the Honda defendants were not negligent with
respect to the design and marketing of the ATV or the warnings that
accompanied the vehicle.  Carwile v. Honda Research & Development
Co.. Ltd. et al., (ED MI).
               The accident occurred in April 1991 on a sandy trail near
Jensen Beach, FL.  Plaintiff Manford Carwile, who was not wearing
a helmet, careened into a tree after entering an S-curve and
suffered a severe closed head injury.

     Plaintiff claimed that design defects made it difficult to
turn the ATV, and also alleged that Honda failed to adequately warn
about the risks of operating the vehicles.  Honda countered that
Carwile's accident was caused by excessive speed, inattention, and
inadequate vehicle maintenance.

     Expert witnesses for the plaintiff were engineer David
Renfroe; Edward Karnes on the adequacy of warnings; Werner Spitz,
M.D., on toxicology and helmet injury-prevention; Gary Lustgarden,
M.D., a neurosurgeon; Robert Ancell, a vocational rehabilitation
expert; Eric Amberg, a neuropsychologist; and economist Michael
Thompson.

     Honda called Kevin Breen, an expert on vehicle design,
accident reconstruction and off-road vehicle riding; Harry H. Hurt,
Jr., on the design and protection offered by motorcycle helmets;
and Dr. Philip Haber, on vocational rehabilitation.  Honda also
called Masayuka Tanaka, an employee of Honda R&D Co., Ltd., to
discuss ATV development and design, and Edward Glynn, an employee
of American Honda Motor Co., to discuss Honda's ATV safety efforts
and the Consumer Product Safety Commission investigation of the
vehicles.

     Honda was represented by Robert K. Miller, Larry C. Mann, and
Timothy J. Mattson of Bowman and Brooke in Minneapolis and Detroit.
Carwile was represented by Steven Leuchtman and Frank Mafrice of
Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz in Detroit.

ALABAMA JURY AWARDS
$120,000 ON DEFECTIVE
SUZUKI FOUR-WHEEL ATV

     An Alabama state court jury awarded $200,000 in damages to
plaintiff Bobby G. Norman, who claimed that a defective throttle
cable in his Suzuki four-wheel all-terrain vehicle led to a loss-
of-control accident in which he suffered serious injuries.  Norman
v. Longshore Cycle Center et al., No. CV-93-56 (AL Cir. Ct.,
Lauderdale Cty.).

     Norman bought the ATV from co-defendant Longshore Cycle
Center.  When riding away from a neighbor's house, he turned the
handlebars of the ATV as far to the right as he could, at which
point the throttle went wide open and the vehicle flew over an em-
bankment.

     The plaintiff went airborne, coming to rest after hitting a
tree and having the ATV flip over with him underneath.  He
sustained numerous cuts and abrasions on his arms and legs, and
tore his right shoulder rotator cuff.  The treating orthopedic
surgeon gave him a 50-50 chance that surgery could alleviate his
condition.

     At the time of the accident, the ATV had only 50 miles of use.
Norman's expert witness, Michael Burleson of Tyler, TX, tested
exemplar throttle cables manufactured by Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki
and Yamaha to determine how much force was needed to cause a
separation.  All of the other brands not only out-performed the
Suzuki cable, but were more substantial in appearance.

     The defendants argued that the accident was caused by operator
error and because Norman failed to take the offered free safety
course.   Their expert witness, Kris Kubly of Madison, WI, tested
the exemplar throttle cables and the actual cable involved in the
accident and found no possibility of malfunction as claimed by the
plaintiff.

     Norman was represented by Debra H. Coble and Frank B. Potts of
Potts & Young in Florence, AL.  Longshore Cycle Center was
represented by Danny D. Henderson of Huntsville, AL.  Suzuki weas
represented by John Bergquist of Parsons, Lee & Juliano in
Birmingham, AL.

PLAINTIFF TELLS 4TH CIR.
THAT ADMITTED DEFECT IS
AN UNREASONABLE DANGER

     In oral argument Dec. 8 before a panel of the Fourth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals, attorneys for appellant Donna Vaughn
contended that errors by the trial judge led to a jury verdict for
Nissan Motor Corp. USA on a claim that a defective voltage
regulator caused battery acid to vaporize and injure Vaughn's lungs
and vocal cords.  Vaughn v. Nissan Motor Corp. USA, No. 95-1086
(4th Cir.); see Automotive LR, Dec. 6, 1994.

     Vaughn claimed that her injuries occurred when the voltage
regulator on her 1989 Nissan Pulsar failed in May 1991.  The South
Carolina federal court jury rejected her claims of strict liability
and breach of warranty.

     On appeal, Vaughn argued that the trial judge erred:

--      in not finding that the defect in the regulator, which
Nissan did not contest, rendered the vehicle unreasonably
dangerous;

--      in requiring a showing that Vaughn was an "ordinary
consumer" when she had a substantial history of treatment for
physical and mental ailments;

--      in rejecting the testimony of four board-certified
physicians that her vocal cord dysfunction was caused by the toxic
battery fumes.  The court compounded the error by allowing Nissan
to present expert testimony that the dysfunction was psychosomatic
in origin, Vaughn claims.

     Nissan responded that the jury credited its evidence that the
defect in the regulator and the resulting vaporization of the
battery acid did not create a level of toxicity sufficient to make
the car unreasonably dangerous.  The jury was instructed properly
that the correct analysis was whether the vapor would have been
unreasonably dangerous for a normal consumer and not for someone
who was peculiarly sensitive to the vapors, Nissan argued.

     The automaker also said the judge ruled properly on
admissibility of expert testimony because no tests or scientific
literature supported their theory of a causal link between exposure
to toxic fumes and vocal cord dysfunction.  Nissan compared this
with the "wealth of documentation" supporting the defense expert's
theory that the dysfunction is almost certainly psychosomatic in
those with Vaughn's medical and psychiatric history.

REPAIR SHOP WINS VERDICT
IN CA NEGLIGENCE CASE

     A California state court jury Nov. 16 returned an 11-1 verdict
for a repair shop charged with negligence when a wheel came off
plaintiff Linda Martin's vehicle shortly after a brake job.  The
defendant claimed that Martin hit an object in the road or a bridge
abutment before the wheel came off.  Martin v. General Auto Repair,
No. 715352 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.).

     Martin took her 1988 Mitsubishi Mirage to General Auto Repair
on Oct. 31, 1992 for rear brake work.  Two days later, the vehicle
spun out of control and hit the bridge abutment.  The left rear
wheel came off sometime during the sequence and was found at the
scene.

     Martin suffered neck, back and shoulder injuries requiring
physical therapy, and emotional distress requiring psychotherapy.
She sought $100,000 claiming $38,000 in past medical expenses and
lost earnings.  Expert witnesses for the plaintiff included
mechanical engineer Martin J. Siegel of Los Angeles and Gilbert
Varela, M.D., of Alhambra, CA.

     General countered that the wheel had come off in an initial
impact with an object or the abutment, and not because of a faulty
repair.  Experts for the defense were mechanical engineer Roger
Clark of Santa Fe Springs, CA and orthopedic surgeon Stephen P.
Kay, M.D., of Century City, CA.

     The jury deliberated for less than two hours before returning
the verdict.

     General Auto Repair was represented by Charles W. Jenkins of
Belofsky & Jenkins in Torrance, CA.  Martin was represented by
Ronald Cher of the Joseph Shalant Law Offices in Los Angeles.

B.F. GOODRICH PETITIONS
CA HIGH COURT ON IMPROPER
SERVICE OF SUMMONS

     In a petition for review filed Dec. 11 with the California
Supreme Court, B.F. Goodrich Co. contends that it was not properly
served with a summons in an exploding-tire case, and that the trial
court disregarded long-standing case authority in adopting the
"substantial compliance rule" and refusing to quash.  B.F. Goodrich
Co. v. CA Super. Ct., Monterey Cty., No. S050529 (CA Sup. Ct.).

     Goodrich says plaintiff Joseph Dinner has conceded that
service was improper in that:

--      Goodrich was not named in the complaint or by amendment;

--      there was no notice pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure Section 412.30;

--      if service was attempted, no designation was made;

--      the summons fails to identify on behalf of whom the person
who received the summons was served;

--      no date of delivery was noted;

--      the summons failed to indicate the name and capacity of the
person who allegedly received service.

     Dinner claims he was injured when a Goodrich tire while being
inflated at gas station.  He then served what Goodrich calls an
"admittedly defective summons" and complaint on "The B.F. Goodrich
Company," not the named defendant "B.F. Goodrich."

     The Monterey County Superior Court judge refused to quash and
the state appeals court denied review.  In its petition to the
California Supreme Court, Goodrich argues, "As the law is clear
that 'the substantial compliance rule' does not apply where the
summons fails to identify the individual being served on behalf of
a corporation, the trial court's ruling exceeded its jurisdiction.
Therefore, based on the evidence before it, the Superior Court
abused its discretion in denying petitioner's motion to quash."

     Goodrich also argues that with the advent of "fast-track"
rules, courts must guard against any tendency to "move the case
along" at the expense of a potential defendant's rights.  "We
cannot trade these rights for expediency, no matter how noble the
cause may be," the petition states.  "The impact of fast track
rules on trial court rulings (such as here) cannot be minimized.
This case presents clear issues of first impression concerning
adequate service, defective pleading and service, and the effect of
fast track rules on the trial court's interest in moving cases to
trial within the fast track limitation framework even against
entities that are not proper parties."

     Goodrich is represented by David B. Paynter, Paul Ellis Baron
and Valerie L. Leatherwood of Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois & Brisgard
in San Francisco.

CITING INSUFFICIENT EXPERT
TESTIMONY, WD VA JUDGE
DISMISSES LIFT GATE SUIT

     U.S. Senior District Judge Glen M. Williams of the Western
District of Virginia granted summary judgment Nov. 21 to Ryder
Truck Rental Inc. and Maxon Industries Inc. in a suit involving an
allegedly defective truck lift gate.  The judge found insufficient
expert evidence on applicable industry and safety standards,
consumer expectations and causation.  Lemons v. Ryder Truck Rental
Inc. et al., No. 93-0055 (WD VA).

     Plaintiff Kenneth Lemons was injured on the job while
unloading a truck rented from Ryder and equipped with a Maxon lift
gate.  The lift gate involved in the accident could not be located.
Lemons' claimed that gate folded and collapsed.  His engineering
expert testified that chains intended to support the gate were not
properly attached to the end of the lift gate platform.

     Judge Williams found the testimony contradictory on whether
there are industry standards for lift gates, citing the expert's
own admission that many different designs exist, and noting that
Maxon lift gates were identically designed with the same purported
defect as some competing products.

     The judge said the expert's testimony on safety in the absence
of an industry standard was insufficient.  For example, comparative
test results were offered without evidence about similarities in
the weight of the plates, nature of the hinge and distance between
the platform edge and attachment point of the support chains.

     Nor did the expert establish that the Maxon lift gate violated
reasonable consumer expectations, the opinion states, having
presented no evidence of noncompliance with actual industry
practices, no knowledge by the defendants of other injuries or
dangers, no published literature and no direct evidence of actual
consumer expectations.

     Judge Williams said Lemons failed to demonstrate that the lift
gate was in the same condition at the time of the accident as it
was when it left either Maxon's or Ryder's control.  The judge
noted that Lemons' employer had previously modified lift gates on
various trucks rented from Ryder.

               Finally, the court found no evidence that the expert's
proffered alternative design was technically feasible and
desirable.  Judge Williams also questioned the expert's
professional credentials but did not exclude his testimony because
the defendants failed to make an exclusion motion.

     Lemons was represented by D. Jeffrey Coale of Abingdon, VA.
Ryder and Maxon were represented by James R. Austin of Roanoke, VA;
Melissa W. Robinson of Roanoke and John E. Kieffer of Bristol, VA.
