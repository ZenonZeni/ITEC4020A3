<!-- <IMG SRC="/fitr/images/red-tri2.gif" ALIGN=left> -->
Since its launch in September 1995, we are pleased to report a very successful half year for FITR.  The varied programme of courses and seminars were all well received by delegates and have helped FITR to rapidly establish a leading reputation in the field of food industry training.
<P>
Our recent BSE seminar highlighted FITR's commitment to providing topical and timely seminars and illustrates the pace at which FITR can respond to industry needs (see page 3).  Established courses such as <B>A Practical Approach to HACCP</B> and <B>Getting Started in Sensory Evaluation</B> were still extremely popular with high numbers of registered delegates, while our <B>Hazards course</B> had its best attendance to date.  New courses including the <B>UHT workshop</B> ran with the maximum number of delegates and <B>Auditing Quality and Safety Systems</B> proved especially useful to those people who have set up HACCP systems.
<P>
New courses are being developed at a rapid rate with input from our large number of client companies.  A new three day course entitled <B>An Introduction to Food Technology</B> was held in April which provided delegates with a valuable insight into modern food technology.  FITR is now registered by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene for basic food hygiene training and we expect to announce a series of such courses at both beginner and advanced levels later this year.  To complement food hygiene training we are also developing a comprehensive range of food microbiology courses.  Watch this space for further details.
<P>
Other courses such as <B>Marketing for Technical Managers</B> (24-26 September 1996) will provide a unique opportunity for technical managers to get to grips with marketing.  This course is the first which is designed to improve the Marketing / Technical interface within companies.
<P>
If you would like to contribute to FITR's development programme please let us have your comments and ideas for new courses on the enclosed  reply card.  FITR aims to be industry reactive and to run courses not already routinely offered.  News of these and regular updates will continue to appear in future issues of On Course.
<P>
To make sure of regular updates on FITR courses, call our Training Centre Manager, Karen Masters on 0118 9318217, or via email at <a href="mailto:FITR@afnovell.reading.ac.uk">FITR@afnovell.reading.ac.uk</a>

<h2><A NAME="HACCP">An Introduction to HACCP - The fast way to learn HACCP</A></h2>

HACCP has become such an important part of modern food manufacturing that a large proportion of technical personnel need to have a general understanding of the system, even if they are not directly responsible for HACCP implementation within their company.  This course provides the ideal, intensive one day introduction to HACCP that delegates need if they are, for example, involved in quality or production.  Participative exercises are used to illustrate the activities necessary to complete a HACCP study and the course gives an overview of the expertise required by HACCP team members.  Delegates attending this course will also receive a course manual containing essential reference material.
<P>
To complement FITR's choice of HACCP courses we are also offering a new video which will assist in-house HACCP training to the whole workforce.  <B>HACCP - How the System Works</B> is a new and authoritative video which explains the principles of HACCP in an accessible and stimulating format while illustrating its role in the safe manufacture of food products.  Aimed at managers and shop floor workers, the video is designed to provide a general understanding of HACCP and to emphasise the individual's role in the food manufacturing process.  For further details, please contact RSSL's Customer Service Desk on 0800 243482.

<h2>FITR Training Sponsorship</h2>

FITR's sponsorship has helped Bernadette Baigrie to attend a two week training session recently in Canada.  Bernadette is one of the UK's most promising young gymnasts and is a member of the under-12 national gymnastics squad.  Overseas training is essential to the development of successful, world class gymnasts and FITRis delighted she was able to attend this important training programme.  Bernadette recently competed in the Swansea International, a major event attracting senior gymnasts of the highest calibre.  During May she will compete in the under-12 Camberley International and in June will represent Southern Region in an international competition in Italy.  On Course will keep you informed of her progress.

<h2>Seminar Updates on BSE</h2>

Over 100 delegates attended a seminar on BSE run by FITR on February 29th.  The seminar was held at a critical time for the meat industry, as subsequent events have proved.  The latest information on the disease was presented by a panel of expert speakers, in a meeting chaired by Prof. Jeff Almond and Prof. David Ledward.  A wealth of data was presented which indicated that beef is safe to eat, and that the risk of humans becoming infected by BSE is very very low.  This remains the position despite the scare that followed in March.
<P>
Commencing the meeting, Ray Bradley, formerly BSE Coordinator at the Central Veterinary Laboratory described the epidemiology of BSE, and presented the encouraging news that the epidemic is declining in response to the controls put in place. The main control has prohibited the use of ruminant protein in ruminant feeds. The ban on specified bovine offals was originally put in place to protect human health and extended in 1990 to protect all species of animal and bird. On the human health side, protection is additionally given by the compulsory slaughter and destruction of all cattle clinically suspected to have BSE. Describing the wider issues for the food industry, Mr Bradley told the meeting that the industry needed to be aware of the epidemiology of the disease and to know enough to be able to interpret data issued by MAFF.  This will help processors to educate customers and address concerns. The industry needs to know the rules put in place to control BSE and follow them. Finally, the industry should not seek competitive advantage by making false or misleading statements about the safety of beef from different herds. All beef is equally safe, regardless of its source. However it is never possible to say all beef is entirely safe, just as it is never possible to give 100% guarantees about the safety of anything.
<P>
Dr Chris Bostock of the Institute for Animal Health Compton then outlined the current understanding of the BSE agent. All spongiform encephalopathies are associated with an accumulation of an abnormal form of PrP protein. The normal form of the PrP protein is present in all mammalian species but little is known about its function in healthy animals. When abnormal PrP is purified from infected animals it has infectivity associated with it, leading to the idea that the abnormal protein on its own can interact with normal PrP to induce it to change to the abnormal form. This goes against conventional ideas of infectious agents and more research is needed to confirm or disprove the hypothesis. The gene coding for PrP has been identified in several species. In man (in which Creutzfeldt Jakobs Disease occurs) and sheep (in which scrapie occurs) mutations in the PrP gene are associated with differences in disease incidence and progression. No link has been found between changes in the gene and susceptibility or resistance to BSE in cattle. Knowledge of the PrP gene/scrapie relationship in sheep has led to the possibility of breeding for scrapie resistance in sheep.
<P>
Dr David Taylor of the Institute for Animal Health's Neuropathogenesis Unit, Edinburgh described the resistance of the BSE agent to inactivation. Neither the BSE nor the scrapie agents are completely inactivated following treatment with sodium hydroxide. Sodium hypochlorite is the only chemical treatment known to be suitable for both. Autoclaving at conventional temperatures and pressure will not totally inactivate the BSE agent and it appears to be more thermostable than the scrapie agent. Neither is it completely inactivated by some standard rendering procedures. Ultimately avoidance of contamination is of prime importance, and where there is any chance that infected material is being handled, it is advisable to use disposable equipment where possible.
<P>
Despite the results of scientific research indicating that BSE presents very little risk to human health, there is still widespread concern about the disease within the scientific and lay communities. Dr Tom Toomey of Ventress Technical Services Ltd presented some reasons for this, dealing in particular with the practicalities of handling beef carcasses. He also referred to the wide suspicion that exists of governmental agencies, the food industry, and the difficulty the general population has in interpreting scientific data. These factors, and generally poor communication of the actual risks associated with the disease, had all contributed to the mistrust. The fact that BSE appears to be infectious in a way unlike conventional infectious diseases also increases the alarm. Keith Anderson then gave an update on the position statement of the IFST. This is generally regarded as offering an accurate and independent account of the known facts about BSE.
<P>
Using the latest available data, Mike Sloyan of the Meat and Livestock Commission described the impact that BSE had had on the market. Prior to Christmas 1995, adverse publicity resulted in a drop in beef sales, especially in retail markets. Retail sales fell by 15-17% compared with the previous year. By mid January, the market was showing signs of recovery, but was still down 12% on last year. Nonetheless these figures demonstrated that the vast majority of consumers had always accepted the safety of beef and there were signs that those who had not were returning to the market. This concluded the seminar.
<P>
Whilst the the latest scare has knocked beef sales again, the recovery seen during January might offer some hope to the beef industry that market confidence can recover once more.

<h3>Making Sense of Marketing</h3>

Marketing is no longer a term that is used to describe a company's promotional activity but has become a core part of business strategy within the food industry.  It covers nearly all aspects of a company's business and, to be effective, should involve everyone in an organisation.  
<P>
A better understanding of marketing improves communication throughout a company and helps to ensure that everyone has common aims and objectives. Technical personnel, in particular, have the difficult role of interfacing effectively with marketing departments and implementing the reality of strategic plans. 

<P>Developing and launching successful products in the food industry has never been easy and often depends on effective team work between technical departments and marketing personnel.  This course is designed to bridge the gap between marketing and technical functions so that ultimately companies can be more productive and effective in the highly competitive food market.
<P>
This intensive three day course provides an authoritative introduction to the marketing of fast- moving consumer goods.  It covers all aspects of the marketing mix including product strategy, branding and promotion as well as looking at the increasingly important roles of packaging, distribution and retailing.  Combined with practical case studies, this course provides an essential training package in marketing which will benefit all layers of management.
<P>
An introduction to marketing provides:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>an introduction to marketing principles
<LI>a guide to better understanding between technical and marketing professionals
<LI>an overview of marketing tools and strategy
<LI>an insight into branding, pricing and packaging
