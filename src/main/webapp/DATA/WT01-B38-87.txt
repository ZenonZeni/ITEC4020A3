<p> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </p>

<p> Overview of Title V-Drug Courts </p>

<p> Federal discretionary grants are being made available under
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Title
V, Public Law 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796 (September 13, 1994), 42
U.S.C. 3796ii-3796ii-8 [hereinafter the &quot;Act&quot;] to
States, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, and
state and local courts for assistance with drug court programs.
The Act gives the Attorney General, and through statutory
authority contained in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act, an authorized designee (in this case the Assistant Attorney
General for the Office of Justice Programs), the authority to
make grants to the above-mentioned entities for drug court
programs that involve continuing judicial supervision over
non-violent offenders with substance abuse problems and the
integrated administration of sanctions and services including:
(1) mandatory periodic testing for, the use of controlled
substances or other addictive substances during any period of
supervised release or probation for each participant; (2)
substance abuse treatment for each participant; (3) diversion,
probation, or other supervised release involving the possibility
of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based on
noncompliance with program requirements or failure to show
satisfactory progress; and (4) programmatic, offender management,
and aftercare services such as relapse prevention, health care,
education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement,
and,child care or other family support services for each
participant requiring such services. </p>

<p> Section 50001 of Title V of the Act requires that regulations
be issued to ensure exclusion of violent offenders from these
funded programs. This proposed rule responds to that requirement.
To more fully develop and define the grant program and to provide
direction and guidance to potential applicants, program
guidelines, will be issued subsequent to the publication of this
proposed rule. This Supplementary Information section is
intended, in part, to elicit comment on a broad range of issues
relevant to the development and implementation of those program
guidelines. </p>

<p> <b>Statement of the Problem</b> </p>

<p> More than half of all individuals brought into the criminal
justice system have substance abuse problems. Many of these
individuals are non-violent offenders who repeatedly cycle
through the court, corrections, and probation systems without
help to change their behavior. The underlying problem of such
non-violent substance abusing offenders frustrates and inhibits
judicial effectiveness. All too often, the non-violent drug
offender faces little certainty of punishment and represents a
long-term, recurring problem for both the criminal justice system
and society. </p>

<p> In too many cases, the criminal justice system fails to
subject non-violent, drug abusing offenders to intervention
measures that provide the mix of services and sanctions necessary
to change their behavior, or if necessary, coerce abstinence.
Some courts and prosecutors, however, have cost-effcctively
addressed the problem through the use of treatment drug courts.
Their results suggest that &quot;drug courts&quot; can
significantly enhance the offender's opportunity to break the
cycle of substance abuse and crime. Those who are coming into
contact with the criminal justice system for the first time may
be particularly susceptible to effective early intervention. </p>

<p> Indeed, research and evaluation demonstrate that the
&quot;drug court&quot; approach is effective in reducing both
drug abuse and drug-related crime. The Drug Court discretionary
grant program of Title V seeks to support the development of
innovative measures that provide courts additional resources to
assure certainty of punishment for drug abusing offenders through
the integrated administration of services and sanctions,
including close supervision and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> <b>The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</b>
</p>

<p> The Department of Justice (Department) recognizes that no
single model exists for an effective drug court. To the contrary,
the Department believes there may be a variety of valid
approaches that deal effectively with non-violent offenders with
substance abuse problems. Consequently, the Drug Court grant
program will maintain flexibility in providing funds to support
the development of a variety of initiatives that coordinate
treatment and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> The Department also recognizes the great diversity in the
structure and operation of state and local courts and criminal
justice systems. Hence, the Department is committed to a flexible
approach that allows jurisdictions to tailor local initiatives to
best suit their needs and local conditions. Program flexibility,
however, is<b> </b>necessarily balanced by statutory requirements
concerning the design and administration of the funded programs.
Accordingly, Drug Court programs that receive grant awards must: </p>

<ul>
    <li>exclude violent offenders from program participation; </li>
    <li>include a long-term strategy and detailed
        implementation.plan; </li>
    <li>explain the applicant's inability to fund the program
        adequately without Federal assistance; </li>
    <li>use Federal support to supplement, and not supplant,
        State, Indian tribal, and local sources of funding that
        would otherwise be available; </li>
    <li>identify related governmental or community initiatives
        which complement or will be coordinated with the
        proposal; </li>
    <li>consult with all affected agencies and insure that there
        will be appropriate coordination with all, affected
        agencies in the implementation of the program; </li>
    <li>certify, that participating offenders will receive
        continuing judicial supervision by one or more designated
        judges with responsibility for the drug court program; </li>
    <li>specify plans for obtaining necessary support and
        continuing the proposed program following the conclusion
        of Federal support; and </li>
    <li>describe the methodology that will be used in evaluating
        the program. </li>
</ul>

<p> Consistent with Congressional intent, program evaluation will
be crucial. Grant recipients will be required to cooperate with a
national evaluation team throughout their involvement with the
program. Recipients will also be required to provide for
independent evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of their
funded programs. The following issues will be especially
important in determining whether programs receiving grants under
this initiative are effective: (1) reduction in recidivism rates
of program participants, (2) maintenance of acceptable substance
abuse treatment completion rates among program participants, (3)
decreased drug use by program participants, and (4) maintenance
of a cost effective program in relation to the overall criminal
justice system. </p>

<p> <b>FY 1995 Drug Court Initiative</b> </p>

<p> The Fiscal Year 1995 Department of Justice Appropriations
Act, Public Law 103-317, has allocated $29 million for the Drug
Court grant programs. Eligibility of applicants to receive grants
will be based on requirements of the statute and these
regulations, as well as assurances and certifications specified
in detailed program guidelines and application materials that
will be available in early 1995 for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug
Court initiative. </p>

<p> While detailed program guidelines will follow the publication
of this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department has made
some broad programmatic decisions upon which it welcomes comment.
Three types of funding will be available under this program
during Fiscal Year 1995. First, planning funding will be
available for those jurisdictions that express interest in
initiating a drug court but have not engaged in the comprehensive
planning necessary to make such a program successful. Second,
jurisdictions currently operating drug court programs may seek
funding to expand enhalace, or augment these ongoing efforts.
Finally, for those jurisdictions that have engaged (or are
currently engaged) in a comprehensive drug court planning
process, funding may be available to implement the plans their
efforts have produced. </p>

<p> <b>Call For Comments Concerning The Drug Court Initiative</b>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse-related offender case management is primarily
a state and local issue; thus, the Drug Court grant program
contemplates collaboration between federal and state and local
agencies. State and local government officials were involved in
Congressional hearings and meetings that guided the development
of this legislation and will continue to be involved as the
Department moves forward in developing this regulation,
establishing policy guidance, and implementing program
guidelines. At this time, comments are welcome regarding the
basic program design requirements described in Section 93.4 of
the proposed rule and to the entire scope of the program. </p>
