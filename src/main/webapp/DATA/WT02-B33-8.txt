CREW ERROR PROBED IN COLOMBIAN CRASH

       A description of the events leading up to the crash of American
Airlines Flight 965 
Dec. 20 in Colombia points strongly to crew error as the probable
cause.
       The Boeing 757-200 was about a dozen miles off course when it
crashed into a mountain as it made a night approach in good weather to
the airport at Cali, Colombia, killing 160 passengers and crew. Four
passengers and a dog survived.
       The report describing the events, prepared from the airplane's
30-minute cockpit voice recording and digital flight data recorder by
Colombian air safety investigators, with assistance from the NTSB and
FAA, depicts the two-man crew as confused about the aircraft's
location as it approached Cali from the north. It says the recordings
revealed no evidence that the crew ran a descent checklist or an
approach procedures briefing. It says there was no evidence of a
mechanical problem, bad weather, bomb or missile, or failure of
pertinent ground-based navigational aids.
       About 63 miles north of the airport, the crew checked in with
Cali Approach Control and was cleared to the Cali VOR (VHF
omnidirectional radio range) near the airport and told to report when
it reached the Tulua VOR on the way. The crew acknowledged the
instruction, according to the report.
       But at some point after the aircraft had already passed south of
the Tulua VOR, the crew programmed the aircraft's flight management
system to fly to the Tulua VOR, the report says. The aircraft, while
continuing to descend, made a 90-second turn to the east, toward the
mountains.
       "Flightcrew discussion took place during this turn regarding a
return to the centerline of the approach course," according to the
report.
       The crew then reset the autopilot and the aircraft turned to the
southwest, back toward the centerline and the airport, according to
the report. 
       Nine seconds before the end of the recordings, the ground
proximity warning system (GPWS) sounded. The GPWS gives crew an
audible warning if the aircraft gets too close to the ground. The crew
increased engine power and pulled up two seconds after the GPWS
warning, the report says. The stick-shaker, a stall-warning, came on
as the crew tried to gain altitude. The flight spoilers, extended
during descent to increase drag, were not retracted, according to the
report.                                                                                      
       The crash of Flight 965 was the worst for a U.S. airliner since
Pan Am Flight 103 crashed in Scotland in 1988, killing all 260 aboard.

FAA STUDYING FEASIBILITY OF CONSOLIDATING THREE BOSTON AREA TRACONS 

       The FAA is looking at whether it can fund the consolidation of
three aging New England terminal radar approach control (TRACON)
facilities into one location.
       The TRACONs at Boston Logan International, Bradley International
in Windsor Locks, Conn., and Manchester Airport in Manchester, N.H.,
are deteriorating, the FAA says. In addition, the facilities would
have to be enlarged to fit new air traffic control (ATC) equipment,
says Ray German, the agency's manager for the Boston Consolidated
TRACON (BCT) project.
       A single TRACON handles arriving and departing traffic within
about 40 miles of an airport. A consolidated TRACON would serve
airspace surrounding all three of the airports. The FAA has
consolidated TRACONs in metropolitan New York City and Southern
California.
       Officials in the FAA's New England region recommended
consolidation after they began looking at the problem of aging
facilities two years ago. This year, the FAA plans to start evaluating
operational, personnel and cost issues for possible sites for the
facility, and now is in the process of choosing a contractor to help.
       The agency is also preparing a cost-benefit study to learn
whether the user benefits of consolidation, such as more direct routes
for aircraft and better management of the region's airspace, can
justify the project's cost, although such benefits are not the main
reason for consolidating the TRACONs, the FAA says. If consolidation
is chosen the controller workforce likely will not be reduced, German
says.
       A decision to fund the project could take as long as a year, he
adds. If consolidation is chosen, the project could be completed as
early as 2002, German says.

FAA QUICKENS STARS PROCUREMENT

       The FAA will award the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement
System (STARS) development contract in April, instead of waiting until
August, because the three firms that passed the pre-bid operational
capability demonstration (OCD) showed significantly more progress than
the agency expected.
       Boeing , Loral and Raytheon, along with their subcontractors,
will be awarded equal value contracts to begin developing STARS, says
FAA spokesman Jeff Thal. The result of funding three separate efforts
is that the FAA will end up with a more mature system, Thal says. The
amount of the contracts has not yet been determined. The early award
date will also allow the contractors to get a jump start on software
development, which the FAA determined from the OCD will take 20 months
rather than 14. By October, after evaluating each company's software,
the FAA will select one firm to complete development, testing, and
production of STARS. The total value of the contract could approach $1
billion. 
       The new equipment, to be installed starting at the end of 1998,
will increase automation of air traffic control, improve weather
displays and provide better surveillance of airspace at more than 220
civilian and military terminal radar approach controls (TRACON)
nationwide.

GEORGIA TRAFFIC EXPERT TO BE NOMINATED TO NTSB

       President Clinton will nominate Georgia transportation official
George Black Jr. to the National Transportation Safety Board, the
White House says.
       Since 1988, Black has been director of transportation for
Gwinnett County, Ga., outside of Atlanta. Black oversees the county's
road, airport, and storm water systems. He has also been a county
traffic engineer, and from 1985 to 1988 was the county's director of
engineering. He co-founded the county police department's fatal
accident investigation unit and has helped investigate more than 1,500
truck and automobile accidents.
       In a statement, the White House says, "Mr. Black's qualifications
and experience as a civil engineer will provide the NTSB with the
technical expertise necessary to evaluate complex highway bridge
design and maintenance issues." Black has a bachelor's degree in civil
engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. During service
in the U.S. Air Force he was a maintenance officer on B-52 and KC-135
aircraft.
       If confirmed by the Senate, Black will fill the remainder of
former member Carl Vogt's term, which expires Dec. 31, 1996. The
current board members are: Chairman Jim Hall, whose term expires Dec.
31, 1997; Vice Chairman Robert Francis (Dec. 31, 1999), and John
Goglia (Dec. 31, 1998). John Hammerschmidt's term ended Dec. 31. His
seat remains unfilled.

FAA SAYS PROPOSED FLIGHT AND DUTY TIME RULES TO COST $899 MILLION 

       The flight and duty time rules for pilots proposed by the FAA
last month as part of a large initiative will cost carriers $899
million over the next 15 years, according to the agency. 
       One provision of the rules, however, would offset these costs by
allowing airline pilots to work longer hours. An increase in the
maximum permitted flight time from eight to 10 hours for two-pilot
crews would produce savings of $1.8 billion in current dollars, the
FAA estimates.
       The Commuter Safety Initiative (CSI), unveiled Dec. 14, included
three separate rules to create `one level of safety' for all airlines.
The commuter rule brings all scheduled airlines operating aircraft
with 10 to 30 seats under Part 121, the rules that govern carriers
operating aircraft with more than 30 seats. The commuter rule and the
air carrier training rule, which require commuters to upgrade their
training, are both final rules. The flight, duty, and rest time rule
is a proposed rule, which means the FAA must consider public comments
before finalizing it (Air Safety Week, Dec. 18, 1995,).
       According to FAA calculations, the commuter rule will cause the
price of a one-way airline ticket to increase by $0.62 for carriers
operating aircraft with 10 to 19 seats and $0.30 for carriers with 20
to 30 seat airplanes. The total cost to airlines of implementing the
rule will be $75 million in current dollars. Initial compliance costs,
however, will be much higher than on-going costs. On a per airplane
basis, the cost to upgrade a 10 to 19 seat airplane will be $19,400
and $21,900 for a 20 to 30 seat airplane in 1996.
       The costliest provision of the flight and duty time rule applies
to the scheduling of reserve pilots who must be available to report
for work at short notice. The proposal requires that allowable duty
time be reduced for reserves who are given less than 10 hours of
notice. Currently, there are no additional restrictions placed on the
duty time of reserve pilots. The FAA estimates that this provision
will cost Part 121 carriers $73 million a year over the next 15 years.
The requirement to count ferry flights toward flight and duty time
limits could cost Part 121 airlines flying unscheduled operations $17
million a year.  
       Despite vociferous opposition to the CSI by Alaskan commuter
carriers and air tour operators concerned about the rule's economic
impact, the FAA did not exempt them from meeting Part 121 standards,
saying these operations are not sufficiently different from other
commuter operations to merit an exemption. 
       The proposed flight and duty time rule reduces the number of duty
hours from 16 to 14 for two-pilot crews. A duty period is the time a
crew member is at work and available to fly. The maximum length of the
duty period increases as the number of pilots in the crew increases. 

  ... Certification Regulations for Airports, Carriers and Aircraft
Also Addressed

       Airports. Commuter airlines still will be allowed to serve
airports that have not been certified under Part 139, the rules
governing airports served by airplanes with more than 30 seats. These
airports will not be required to meet the air carrier standards, since
the FAA is prohibited by federal law from regulating airports that
serve airplanes with 30 or fewer seats. Should Congress pass
legislation allowing the FAA to regulate airports serving airplanes
with 10 to 30 seats, the agency has assigned the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee to recommend the requirements in Part 139 that
should be applied to airports now serving commuter operations.
       Carriers. The commuter rule creates a new part, Part 119, that
consolidates certification, operations and maintenance requirements
for Part 121 and Part 135 operations.
       Aircraft. Starting in March, the rule requires all new type
certifications for 10- to 19-seat airplanes to meet transport category
standards, Part 25. The existing fleet of this size aircraft can
continue to operate under their current type certification, but must
meet upgraded equipment and performance requirements.

LEGAL DECISIONS

* ADMINISTRATOR V. BUTCHKOSKY, NTSB ORDER NO. EA-4407, NOV. 30, 1995. 
The NTSB affirmed the revocation of the airman certificates of Alex
Butchkosky, who had appealed Administrative Law Judge William Pope's
affirmation of the FAA's revocation. The FAA revoked Butchkosky's
certificates because in 1989 he was convicted in U.S. District Court
of three offenses involving importation and distribution of marijuana
and because when applying for a medical certificate in 1990 he
answered "no" to the question of whether he had ever been convicted of
a crime. Butchkosky said he was told by a representative of the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association that convictions under appeal
did not have to be reported. Pope said Butchkosky "did not honestly
believe that he had no criminal convictions when he completed his
medical certificate." The board said it would not challenge a judge's
credibility finding unless there was evidence it was arbitrary.

*  Administrator v. Larson, NTSB Order No. EA-4408, Dec. 1, 1995. The
NTSB denied the appeal of Alan Larson, an Alaska Island Air Inc. pilot
whom the FAA fined $15,000 for flying a DC-3 in September 1993 without
a qualified second-in-command, flying an aircraft that was not
airworthy, and falsifying a flight log. Larson appealed to the NTSB
after Administrative Law Judge Patrick Geraghty upheld the fine but
reduced it to $13,000. In his appeal to the board, Larson made three
arguments. He argued, for the first time during the case, that the FAA
had no jurisdiction over most of the more than 50 flights it cited in
its complaint because the DC-3 was being operated as a public
aircraft, and therefore was not subject to the Federal Aviation
Regulations the FAA claims Larson violated. The board discarded that
argument because Larson admitted the FAA's allegation in its complaint
that the DC-3 in question was a civil aircraft. Second, the board said
that although the flights were paid for by the U.S. government, that
did not necessarily mean the aircraft should have been designated a
public aircraft. Finally, the board said that even if Larson had been
flying a public aircraft, many FARs would still have applied. Because
the civil status of the aircraft was not in dispute as the case was
litigated, the board said it had no reason to pick through the
violations after the fact to see which might have applied and which
might have been dismissed, and how that reassessment might have
affected the penalty the FAA assessed.

*  Administrator v. Kline, NTSB Order No. EA-4409, Nov. 30, 1995. The
NTSB granted, in part, the appeal of the FAA after Administrative Law
Judge William Mullins reversed part of the FAA's decision to suspend
the private pilot certificate of Forrest Kline for flying too low over
a house in Rimrock, Ariz., several times in August 1994. The FAA had
suspended Kline's certificate for 120 days, claiming he violated
Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Section 91.13(a) by flying his World
War I biplane carelessly or recklessly and FAR Section 91.119(c) by
flying less that 500 feet over a house that was just off the end of
the runway at a private airport in Rimrock. Because of the terrain at
that airport, aircraft land and depart in opposite directions, which
requires departing aircraft to make a sharp right-hand turn after
takeoff, according to NTSB documents. Kline appealed to the judge, who
upheld the violation of Section 91.13 but dismissed the violation of
Section 91.119, saying the right-hand turn after takeoff was
appropriate. The judge reduced the suspension to 45 days. The FAA
appealed the judge's decision to the NTSB, which reinstated the
violation of Section 91.119, saying there was no reason Kline could
not have delayed his right turn slightly to avoid flying over the
house. The NTSB left the suspension at 45 days, arguing that the two
charges were duplicative.

TWO MEN CONVICTED OF MAKING/SELLING COUNTERFEIT PARTS FOR BOEING 727S

 *  Two men and their companies were convicted Dec. 15 in federal
criminal court of making and selling counterfeit parts for Boeing
727s. Arthur Stewart and his company Gary Aerospace Corp. of Hondo,
Texas, and Jose Mendiola and his company, JLM Aviation International
Inc. of Naperville, Ill., will be sentenced March 12. Stewart and Gary
Aerospace were convicted of conspiring to manufacture fake Boeing slat
track roller bolt assemblies, according to the DOT. Mendiola and JLM
were convicted of conspiring to sell the fake assemblies to domestic
buyers and to Mexicana Airlines. Mendiola and JLM also were convicted
of submitting false statements to federal authorities. Both men and
their companies also were convicted of mail and wire fraud. The FAA
notified carriers of the fake parts early in the DOT's investigation.

INDUSTRY TASK FORCE REPORT IS "FIRST-CLASS

*  An official FAA response isn't due until later this month, but FAA
Administrator David Hinson says an industry task force report on
implementation of free flight is "first-class." RTCA Task Force 3
presented its report to Hinson in October. It lays out a path to free
flight, the more direct routing of aircraft using communications,
navigation and surveillance technology. FAA Associate Administrator
for Regulation and Certification Tony Broderick said, "We agree in
principle with the recommendations." Among the report's 44
recommendations is a call for a government-industry free flight
steering group to pick up where the task force left off.

A WORN MAGNETO & PILOT ERROR COMBINED CAUSED CRASH OF PILATUS BRITTEN-
NORMAN BN2A-20 ISLANDER

*  A worn magneto and pilot error combined to cause the December 1993
crash of a Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2A-20 Islander on a night flight
from Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, to Inuvik, the Transportation
Safety Board of Canada has found. All seven aboard were killed when
the plane crashed eight miles south of the Inuvik airstrip. The board
said the right engine's left-hand magneto (Bendix S6LN-1227) had
excessive wear between the flyweight and axle pin, which led to
magneto failure and right engine failure. Investigators could find no
evidence that the aircraft operator, Arctic Wings and Rotors, had
complied with an FAA airworthiness directive (AD-78-09-07 R3, issued
Jan. 17, 1983) that called for inspection of the magnetos. Further,
the board found that after the right engine failed the pilot rotated
the rudder trim wheel in the wrong direction, which compounded the yaw
and roll to the right.
