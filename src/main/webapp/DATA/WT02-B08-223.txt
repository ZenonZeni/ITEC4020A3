<h3>Background</h3>

I read Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, specialising in Physics and 
Theoretical Physics, then undertook doctoral research at the Cavendish Laboratory, 
Cambridge, first in molecular aerodynamics and subsequently in radio astronomy. I 
graduated with a BA in 1980, an MA in 1984 and a PhD in 1985. In 1985 I was elected a Member, 
and in 1996 a Fellow, of the Institute of Physics.
<p>

Since 1985 I have directed the Remote Sensing Group of the Scott Polar Research Institute, 
with main research interests in
<ul>
<li>Active microwave investigation of land-ice and sea-ice surfaces.
<li>Image structure in visible and infrared wavelength images of ice and snow surfaces.
<li>Satellite investigation of effects of industrial pollution on tundra vegetation.
<li>Satellite investigation of frozen ground and oil spill phenomena.
<li>Differential refraction phenomena, including the formation of mirages.
<li>New techniques for tracking migratory birds.
</ul>
I have fieldwork experience in Svalbard and the Russian Arctic.
