<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">Vaxcel's mission
is to develop and license Optivax&#174; to vaccine companies.
The Company was incorporated in 1993 and is today a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CytRx Corporation. Vaxcel's current plan is to continue
to build value in its technology and then seek outside financing
in late 1996.<BR>

   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is <BR>
Optivax: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Optivax&reg;
is a family of proprietary compounds that improves the effectiveness
of both currently available vaccines and vaccines under development.
Vaxcel and its collaborators have conducted numerous preclinical
studies using Optivax with a variety of different vaccines. These
studies have shown that Optivax represents a more effective method
of administering vaccines.</FONT> </TD>
<TR>
  <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What are<BR>
 Vaccines:  </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaccines
are medicines designed to prevent the occurrence of infectious
diseases by stimulating the body's natural defenses, the immune
system. Vaccines may have contributed more to disease eradication
than any other medical intervention, as some of the most devastating
human diseases, such as polio, smallpox, tetanus, pertussis, measles,
etc., have been significantly controlled by safe and effective
vaccines. More recently, vaccines to prevent hepatitis, bacterial
meningitis, and chickenpox have been commercialized and are being
widely administered.<BR>
</FONT></TD>
<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Need for <BR>
 Optivax: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There
are four (4) distinct medical needs for Optivax:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">i) many currently marketed vaccines
require multiple doses and several visits to a physician or medical
center to adequately protect individuals against disease. This
is a complex and costly procedure that often leads to noncompliance
by individuals. Therefore, considerable reward would be gained
by reducing the number of required injections with Optivax.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ii) some currently marketed vaccines
are only marginally effective, and consequently, patients contract
disease even though they are properly immunized. Vaxcel believes
Optivax can increase the effectiveness of marginally effective
vaccines, thereby improving patient response rates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> iii) a promising approach to new
vaccine development is the area of subunit vaccines. While promising,
many new subunit vaccine candidates are poorly immunogenic and
therefore lack the efficacy required for FDA approval.  Vaxcel
believes Optivax will enhance the effectiveness of subunit vaccines,
thereby providing the required efficacy for approval and ultimate
commercialization.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> iv) oral immunization has numerous
advantages over injectable vaccines, including patient acceptability,
ease of administration, and induction of mucosal immunity. Vaxcel
believes its oral vaccine delivery technology is promising and
the commercial value of this technology is high.</FONT></TD>
<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Actions of <BR>
Optivax: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Optivax
is based on the ability of certain copolymers to augment or modify
the immune response to vaccines. The copolymers are combined with
an antigen, and in some instances other active ingredients, to
form a final vaccine formulation. Optivax acts both as a delivery
system by targeting vaccines to cells of the immune system and
as a classical vaccine adjuvant because of its ability to augment
the immune system's response to vaccines.<BR>
</FONT></TD>
<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Status: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaxcel
is currently collaborating with pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies to evaluate Optivax with their human vaccines. In addition,
Vaxcel recently completed a definitive license agreement for Optivax
with Corixa Corporation and also has option agreements with Connaught,
Inc. and Medeva PLC to evaluate and develop human vaccines using
Optivax.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> In January 1996, a Phase I trial
was initiated at a comprehensive cancer center to evaluate the
human safety of Optivax administered in combination with a beta
human chorionic gonadotropin based vaccine in patients with metastatic
cancer.<BR>
</FONT></TD>
<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaxcel <BR>
Strategy:</FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaxcel
plans to aggressively license Optivax to numerous pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies that are engaged in vaccine research
and development. These companies will combine Optivax with their
vaccines and assume responsibility for product development, regulatory
approval, and marketing - all at their expense. In return, Vaxcel
will receive upfront licensing fees, milestone payments, and royalties
on sales.<BR>
</FONT></TD>
<TR>
   <TD VALIGN=top><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Vaccine <BR>
Market: </FONT></B></TD>
   <TD><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">According
to industry sources, the global vaccine market is estimated at
over $2 billion. Sales of vaccines are expected to grow in the
future at double digit annual rates because: (i) many new vaccines
are expected to be commercialized within the next decade; (ii)
vaccines are one of the most cost-effective medical tools, an
important consideration given global efforts to control health
care costs; and (iii) vaccines are a promising medical alternative
for dealing with the problem of antibiotic resistance.<BR>
