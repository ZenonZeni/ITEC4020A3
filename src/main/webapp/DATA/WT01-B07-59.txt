<P>
Richard Karney, Director of the Building Systems and Materials
Division at the <A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/" >US Department of Energy  
</A>, delivered the Welcome Address and introduced the Keynote
Speaker, Commissioner Jannane Sharpless from the <A HREF="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/" >California Energy Commission  
</A>, who spoke about the need for long-term public investment
to complement the research and development projects funded by
private industry.
<H3><A NAME="Energy">Energy Impact</A></H3>

<P>
Several presentations focused on energy consumption. The first
by Don Colliver (<A HREF="http://www.bae.uky.edu/" >University of Kentucky  
</A>, USA) outlined the results of a study to determine the energy
necessary to condition a fixed flow rate of outside air to various
heating and cooling set points. Later on, J&uuml;rgen R&ouml;ben,
of the <A href="http://www.uni-essen.de/" >Universit&aumlt Essen  
</A>in Germany, discussed the benefit of low energy dehumidification,
achieved with an open cycle liquid desiccant system, whilst Professor
Fritz Steimle, also from Essen, described how the separation of
sensible cooling from latent heat removal can allow a more energy
efficient system.
<H3><A NAME="Standards">Standards</A></H3>

<P>
A workshop on standardisation encouraged various speakers to give
an informal presentation on the current situations in their respective
countries. Codes and Standards were also the subject of several
papers delivered throughout the conference and included a presentation
by Gene Tucker (<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/" >EPA  </A>, USA)
about the current revisions to <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  
</A>Standard 62-1989 &quot;Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air
Quality&quot;. Also from the USA, Bud Offermann (Indoor Environmental
Engineering) demonstrated the procedure for an experimental evaluation
of <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  </A>Standard 129
&quot;Standard Method of Measuring Air Change Effectiveness&quot;.
<H3><A NAME="Offices">Offices</A> and Large Enclosures</H3>

<P>
Measurements to determine ventilation effectiveness in four mechanically
ventilated New Zealand office buildings highlighted the importance
of planning the ventilation system around the floor layout. Continuing
with offices, Peter Wouters (BBRI, Belgium) described the installation
and operation of an infra-red (IR) detector controlled ventilation
system. It was shown that, provided attention was paid to duct
airtightness, then the IR detection facility can provide significant
energy savings. Elia Sterling (T.D.Sterling &amp; Assocs, Canada)
summarised the planning and design of some prototype energy efficient
offices, and Earle Perera (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >BRE  
</A>, UK) illustrated how trickle ventilators are able to supply
adequate background ventilation for occupied offices. Alois Sch&auml;lin
(<A HREF="http://www.ethz.ch/" >Federal Institute of Technology  
</A>, Switzerland) reported on both the method of predicting air
flows through open aircraft hanger doors using transient thermal
models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the possibility
of using huge air curtains to reduce heat loss in <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/bcs/annex26.html" >such structures  
</A>. From Sweden, Sture Holmberg (<A HREF="http://www.nioh.se/nioh.html" >National Institute of Occupational Health  
</A>) showed encouraging results from field measurements, carried
out in the plastics industry, of the principles of practical displacement
ventilation. Two strategies for cooling (without dehumidification)
in non-residential buildings were explained by Andrew Martin (BSRIA,
UK) and Willigert Raatschen (Dornier GmbH, Germany). The UK strategy
concerned the use of automatic controls for natural ventilation
and passive cooling, whereas the German author presented the testing
of a thermosyphoning facade system.
<H3>Ventilation in the <A NAME="Home">Home</A></H3>

<P>
Lars-G&ouml;ran M&aring;nsson (LGM Consult AB, Sweden) discussed
the various criteria influencing <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/bcs/annex27.html" >domestic ventilation system performance  
</A>. As part of the <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/bcs/annex27.html" >same study  
</A>, Johnny Kronvall (J &amp; W Consulting Engineers AB, Sweden)
described the simulation of passive stack ventilation (PSV) in
a single family house and suggested possible improvements. From
the Swedish National Testing &amp; Research Institute, Thomas
Carlsson outlined the results of calculations for mechanical exhaust
and balanced mechanical systems, concluding that outdoor air should
be supplied only via the bedrooms for both these systems. Also,
&Aring;ke Blomsterberg, from the same organisation, contrasted
the outcome of long-term monitoring of a representative sample
of dwellings in Sweden for different ventilation systems and also
showed the results of an occupant survey of indoor climate and
user interaction in post-1988 single family Swedish dwellings.
Findings reported by Duncan Hill (<A HREF="http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/cmhc.html" >CMHC  
</A>) of an occupant survey in Canada concluded that increased
consumer education and refinement of controls and maintenance
strategies would be needed to ensure more success with mechanical
ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR).
<P>
Ulf Kr&uuml;ger (<A HREF="http://www.chalmers.se/Home-E.html" >Chalmers University  
</A>, Sweden) proposed that slot inlet devices are very difficult
to position without causing thermal discomfort. He justified this
with studies of temperature and air velocity distributions around
these devices in relation to occupation zones in residential buildings.
Still in Scandinavia, J&oslash;rn Brunsell (Norwegian Building
Research Institute) reported field tests of dynamic insulation
in four houses. These revealed that it is essential for the air
flow to remain constant, irrespective of climate, occupants, or
infiltration.
<H3><A NAME="Retrofit">Retrofit</A></H3>

<P>
Retrofit activities are very important, because the existing building
stock is substantially larger in size than the new building stock.
The number of buildings in need of renovation is therefore significant.
Peter Op 't Veld (NOVEM bv, The Netherlands) described the E'novation
programme of renovation of dwellings, in which buildings with
high energy use, poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and often moisture
and mould growth, were made more energy efficient (by an average
of 39%) with, in addition, improved IAQ. An overview of a French
guide to assist in the choice and sizing of PSV systems for apartment
retrofits for ventilation and gas exhaust flues was given by Jean-Georges
Villenave of <A HREF="http://193.104.99.10/" >CSTB  </A>. From
<A HREF="http://www.vtt.fi/rte/bldtech.html" >VTT Building Technology  
</A>in Finland, Jorma Sateri argued that the installation of heat
recovery in existing Finnish multi-family buildings would be economically
feasible if their airtightness was 2 to 3 air changes per hour
at 50 Pa, or better.
<H3><A NAME="Mites">Mites</A>, Mould and Moisture</H3>

<P>
Jan Nielsen (Danish Building Research Institute, Denmark) measured
humidity levels in 16 humidity-controlled mechanically ventilated
apartments in conjunction with another 16 identical apartments
(as a control group) with constant ventilation. Interestingly,
the humidity-controlled apartments were found to use less energy
for heating than the control group, but still met humidity requirements.
Furthermore, Donald McIntyre (EA Technology, UK) presented survey
results (conducted during a winter period) of humidity and dust
mites in 20 houses with MVHR and 20 other houses, from which he
concluded that the majority of the MVHR houses had humidity levels
sufficiently low to reduce dust mite numbers. This contrasted
with a minority of the other houses. Sarah Palin, also from EA
Technology, made a comparison of the energy consumption and resultant
indoor humidity levels with each of PSV, MVHR, and mechanical
extract fans (MEF) in a single family test house. Nigel Oseland
(<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >BRE  </A>, UK) found that the
results of a postal survey of occupants of UK dwellings with either
PSV or MEF showed, in general, that those with PSV in their homes
seemed to have least problems with condensation or mould.
<H3><A NAME="Radon">Radon</A></H3>

<P>
Paul Welsh (<A HREF="http://www.bre.co.uk/" >BRE  </A>, UK) and
<A HREF="http://www.shef.ac.uk/students/ar/arp94fw/wang.html" >Fan Wang 
</A>(University of Sheffield, UK) have been independently examining
techniques for reducing radon concentration in UK single family
dwellings. Their results presented at the Conference, indicated
that extract ventilation (depressurisation) of the underfloor
space produced the greatest reduction in radon levels in the living
area. Pirjo Korhonen (University of Kuopio, Finland) found that
radon levels in various workplaces in Finland depended mainly
on the type of foundation and the magnitude of depressurisation
of the work space. Richard Grot (Lagus Applied Technology, USA)
explained how, using SF6 as a tracer gas in tunnels in a uranium
mine, the transport of radon through the overlying soil and into
the cellars of 15 different buildings above had been investigated.
<H3><A NAME="Calculation">Calculation </A>Techniques</H3>

<P>
An important mechanism for implementing research results is the
production of calculation methods. Iain Walker (<A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/" >LBNL  
</A>, USA) explained his simplified procedure for the calculation
of attic ventilation rates. Willem de Gids (<A HREF="http://www.tno.nl/instit/bouw/home.html" >TNO  
</A>, The Netherlands) stated that <A HREF="http://www.tno.nl/instit/bouw/home.html" >TNO  
</A>now has an algorithm for the calculation of building surface
wind pressure coefficients, which has been designed to take into
account surrounding shielding. An integrated approach to predicting
building air flows by combining network models, CFD, and thermal
simulation was reported by Jan Hensen (<A HREF="http://www.strath.ac.uk/Departments/ESRU/esru.html" >University of Strathclyde  
</A>, UK) together with the 'onions' and 'ping-pong' alternative
methods of coupling heat and air flow solvers. Both Muriel Regard
(<A HREF="http://www.entpe.fr/" >ENTPE  </A>, France) and Martin
Simons (<A HREF="http://www.gold.net/users/ea78/iobe.htm" >Coventry University  
</A>, UK) presented their work on using CFD for ventilation effectiveness
calculations. Prompted by <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  
</A>Standard 62-1989, Milton Meckler (The Meckler Group, USA)
demonstrated dynamic IAQ models of ventilation system response
to emissions.
<H3><A NAME="Measurement">Measurement</A> Techniques</H3>

<P>
A crucial aspect of ventilation research is having good measurement
techniques. Stephen Flanders (<A HREF="http://www.usace.army.mil/inside/crrel-w3/crrel-text/" >US Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory  
</A>, USA) pointed out the uncertainties associated with fan pressurisation
measurement, in particular, if <A HREF="http://www.iso.ch/" >ISO  
</A>, CGSB and ASTM protocols are followed. Michael Cui (<A HREF="http://www.uiuc.edu/" >University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
</A>, USA) has been using particle-imaging velocimetry to produce
whole room air velocity profiles. Peter Wouters (BBRI, Belgium)
proposed that acceptable results can be achieved for the investigation
of airborne moisture transport if accurate humidity measurements
are made and tracer gas studies are used to find air flow rates.
<H3>Conference <A NAME="Awards">Awards</A> and Banquet</H3>

<P>
Miriam Byrne, Imperial College, UK received the Best Paper award
for her presentation entitled &quot;Particulate Deposition on
Indoor Surfaces - its Role, with Ventilation, in Indoor Air Quality
Prediction&quot;. The Best Poster was awarded to Richard Diamond
and Helmut Feustel of <A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/" >LBNL  </A>,
USA for their poster entitled &quot;Air Flow Distribution in a
Mechanically Ventilated High-Rise Residential Building&quot;.
Both these awards were presented by the Guest Speaker, John Millhone,
Senior Fellow, Advanced International Studies, Battelle Pacific
Northwest Laboratories (on assignment from the <A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/" >US Department of Energy  
</A>). After the awards, John Millhone delivered an address entitled
&quot;AIVC - Looking to the Next 16 Years&quot; in which he stressed
the importance of the AIVC grasping the new opportunities created
by the growing international recognition of the importance of
energy efficiency. He said that changes are occurring in Central
and Eastern Europe, as countries in this area emerge from a centrally
controlled to a free-market economy which exposes their profligate
energy use and artificially low prices. He also saw AIVC playing
an expanded role in the growing concern over the damage to the
earth's climate being caused by greenhouse gases. He elaborated
by saying that as the dominant greenhouse gas emission is carbon
dioxide which is produced primarily by the burning of fossil fuels
for energy, then it follows that energy efficiency programs are
the fastest, cheapest and largest option available for containing
this problem. He went on to say that the AIVC must expand their
mission to provide information and services, designed for the
air infiltration and ventilation problems of the emerging free-market
countries, if necessary at a discounted cost or even funded through
a third party. In this way, he sees it as a low-cost method of
buying a world-class technology transfer service and the unique
and significant findings of the researchers in these new participating
countries would enrich the body of knowledge of the AIVC and give
it an expanded relevance to major energy efficiency and environmental
problems of the next 16 years. Just before the close of the Conference,
the Summing-Up was given by Martin Liddament, Head of the AIVC,
who reviewed how this field has progressed over the last 16 years.
