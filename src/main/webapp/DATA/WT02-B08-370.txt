<title> A Quest For The Truth  </title>

<h2 align=center> A Quest For The Truth  </h2>
A gentleman by the name of Gene Haugen wrote to Quest international in Granville, Ohio requesting information on how to respond to individuals who might be critical of the Quest program. Mr. Haugne received a nice letter thanking him for his interest in Quest. The letter said, "when concerns surface about any program, we find it's best to respect the concerns and encourage understanding by presenting facts rather than trying persuasive arguments." The material enclosed the "correct response" to any questions the might surface concerning the quest program. When comparing what this material says about quest, with the study of some very well respected doctors and professors, there are some obvious discrepancies. So lets go on a quest for the truth.
<p> According to Quest International material: "We do not have the students participating in values clarification activities. Rather we have identified the values to be imparted to children through classroom discussion and activities."
<p> Yet according to Mr. Kirschenbaum who was hired to co-author one of the Quest programs entitled, Skills for Living, made this comment while speaking before the national convention of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. "It has lots of values clarification in it.....lots of self-talk.
<p> According to Quest International material: "As I understand it, humanism is a belief that denies the existence of God and determines what is right and wrong by situation that is situational ethics or humanistic values. Quest in no way supports these ideas. ....We in no way intend for a child to become their own god or deny the existence of God."
<p> Mr. Kirschenbaum also told the national convention of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, It's the thing you know, a really fine synthesis of alive humanistic educations."
<p> According to Quest International material: "We in no way condone or suggest that a teacher take on the role of a therapist while implementing a Quest program." "Quest programs are not experimental, nor do they include psychological/psychiatric testing," (personality testing).
<p> According to Dr. Harold M. Voth, Chief of Staff of psychiatrist/psyschanalyst at the Veterans Administration in Topeka Kansas, "these exercises do amount to personality tests and some sections serve as guide for therapy". According to Dr. Joseph Adelson, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, quest constitutes personality testing. "In my view certain parts of the syllabus qualify as 'personality testing.'" He goes on to say, "I am almost certain that most lawyers and most courts would hold this to be personality testing. "Givenin the nature of these instruments, it seems to me quite clear that parental consent must be obtained, by provisions of the Hatch Amendment." Remember the Hatch Amendment the Hatch Amendment sates that it is illegal for a child to under go personality testing without the written permission from the child's parents. Concerning quest implementation of teachers as therapist, Dr. Voth has said, "exposing the child to the broad issues introduced by the quest exercises and orchestrated by teachers of unknown mental health and stability places the child in a positions of great risk."
<p> Johnny Kilpatrick, author of Why Johnny Can't Tell Right From Wrong, writes, "group leaders or 'facilitators' of the Quest program are required to attend a three-day workshop which is basically a crash course in the techniques of client-centered therapy. The advice they receive is similar to the advice a fledgling therapist might receive before meeting his first client."
<p> According to Quest International material:
<br> Concerning the effectiveness of the quest program in the area of acting a deterrent to drug use as an anti-drug and alcohol program, Quest International material states. "There are no studies known to Quest which demonstrate that participation in Quest programs lead to subsequent use of drugs or illicit substances."
<p> Dr. Adelson says. "I believe the school authorities ought to scrutinize closely the tacit substance of abuse. In the past, results for programs like this have been very mixed indeed. ....Some of them actually increase drug use by stimulating curiosity."
<p> The "Office of educational Research and Improvement" U.S. Department of Education", 1988 put out a booklet entitled "Drug Prevention Curricula A Guide to Selection and Implementation." On page 43, the Department advised that selection should be based upon a number of considerations. One of these is a "proven track record of success if purchased from a publisher." Quest does not have a proven track record.
<p> On December 23, 1989, Kathleen Honeycutt, a concerned citizen who was trying to determine the value or lack of it, concerning the quest program, received a package on information from Dr. Jerry Walker, Director of Evaluation for Quest International. Kathleen Honeycutt had written to Quest International requesting "actual documentation to substantiate their claim that their curriculum has been successful in reducing substance abuse. This packet contained summaries of 25 reports, none of which provided documentation that the curriculum has been effective in reducing substance abuse among students".
<p> Professor W. R. Coulson, one of the pioneers of Quest, now travels the country exposing the flaws behind Quest. Professor Coulson reported, "when I visited the Skills for Adolescence classroom in San Diego, there was lots of talk of 'I feel' statements. There is no way to explain but to say that students were practicing turning morality into reports of feelings. Although Skills of Adolescence is sold explicitly as drug education, there was no talk of drugs in the session I observed, and I was told, that by design, there would be none till the last three weeks of the course. Even then the focus would be on subjectivity and 'decision making.'"
<p> According to Quest International material: Concerning undermining of parents and parental authority, Quest International sates, "We believe that parents are the primary educators of their children....Children are taught to be a better family member, not encouraged to evaluate or sit in judgement of the family or parents. nor to the programs usurp parental authority."
<p> According an August 1990, publication of Concerned Women for America, "Skills for Adolescence. rather than serving as a source of reinforcement for the family, provokes the destruction of ties, dismissal of the family's accepted value system, and the perception that behavior, house rules, and discipline are negotiable. The student guide/textbook, Changes: Becoming the Best You Can Be, implies that conflict within the family is an expected variable in all homes, and no one, including the reader, is ever entirely at fault. In the introduction to the book, parents presumably excluded from this immunity, are referred to as "noisy prison wardens."
