<DT><B>What is a stock?</B>
<DD>A stock is more than a piece of paper.  It's a piece of a company.  Ownership of that piece of the company entitles you to vote on important matters such as the election of the corporation's directors.  It entitles you to receive any dividends that are paid.  And, most important of all, it entitles you to benefit from that company's growth over time, as the stock's price changes over time to reflect the company's progress.
<BR>
<DT><B>Why should I own stocks?</B>
<DD>To make your money grow!  Over the very long-term, stocks have proven a better investment than anything else.  Since 1945, for example, the stocks in the S&P 500 have brought investors an average annual rate of return of 11.9%.  Stocks of small companies, which grow even faster than big companies, have brought investors 14.4%.  By comparison, investors in Treasury Bills have earned just 4.7% and investors in silver have earned just 4.6%.
<BR>
<DT><B>How many stocks should I own?</B>  
<DD>The typical investor needs no more than 5 to 10 stocks.  Of course, just one stock can be enough if it goes up.  But all stocks do not go up.  And you'll find that success is generally achieved by quickly getting rid of your losers while holding, and even buying more of, your winners.  When you have a portfolio of 5 to 10 stocks, you should always be on the lookout for those that are failing to perform, thinking about where that money could be better utilized.
<BR>
<DT><B>How do I buy a stock?</B>  
<DD>First you must open an account at a brokerage firm, usually by mailing them a check.  From there, It's simple a matter of communicating your buy and sell orders.  Though It's not necessary, It's a good idea to know the stock's trading symbol (example: Microsoft's is MSFT) when you place your order.  You should also know the current price of the stock so that you can calculate the number of shares you want to buy.  At most brokerage firms, you'll pay a lower percentage as a commission if you buy larger amounts of stock.  And you'll get more favorable rates if you buy round lots (100 shares, for example, instead of 97).
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a stock broker?</B>  
<DD>A stock broker is the middle man who takes your buy or sell order and relays it to the market.  A discount broker can perform this same basic service for a relatively small commission.  And if you use a discount broker with modern technology, you may never even talk to another person.  Then there are full service brokers, where you pay a higher commission, but you get personal service from a professional.  In the best cases, this professional is able to help you by suggesting specific investment moves tailored to your personal situation.  His goal is to keep you as a long-term successful client.  But remember, the broker only gets paid when you trade.  So there is an incentive to advise you to trade. . . . .to buy and sell stocks, possibly more frequently than you should.
<BR>
<DT><B>What or Where is the stock market?</B>  
<DD>You might say that Wall Street, in lower Manhattan, New York City, typifies the stock market, because that's where most exchanges and stock brokers are concentrated.  But in this age of electronic commerce, geography really doesn't matter.  There are three major exchanges in the U.S.  The New York Stock Exchange (otherwise known as the Big Board) is where you'll find the biggest, established companies.  Many of these companies pay dividends.  The American Stock Exchange is the second oldest exchange and holds smaller firms.  And the Nasdaq. . . . .National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (or OTC market) is a particularly vibrant market where you'll find some of the fastest growing companies in the country.  The majority of Cabot's stocks are found on the Nasdaq.  All three of these exchanges provide daily price quotes to newspapers of all their stocks.  But there are other, less formal markets called the OTC bulletin board or pink sheets, where trading is less regular and risk tends to be higher.  In most cases these stocks are too speculative for us.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a dividend?</B>  
<DD>A dividend is an amount of money, paid by a company to its shareholders, usually on a regular basis.  Why does it do this?  One, to keep shareholders happy by passing on profits to them.  And two, because the company can't find a better use for the money!  Management doesn't know how to use the money to make the company grow.  Usually, the bigger the dividend, the poorer the company's growth prospects.
<BR>
<DT><B>How does Cabot pick stocks?</B>  
<DD>Cabot's stock selection system starts by focusing on stocks that are strong, going up faster than the general market.  These stocks are said to have positive momentum.  But we need to see more than that.  Behind each stock we want to see a great growth company.  In most cases we require a company to be demonstrating strong growth of both sales and earnings.  And we want to find a story that convinces us this great earnings growth is likely to continue in the years ahead.
<BR>
<DT><B>How does Cabot determine that a stock is strong?</B>  
<DD>We look for stocks with strong relative performance (RP), sometimes called relative strength.  These are stocks performing better than the general market over the long-term.
<BR>
<DT><B>How does Cabot identify a great growth company? </B> 
<DD>In short, we want to see a company that appears capable of multiplying its earnings rapidly.  Characteristics we like to see include a revolutionary product or service, mass markets, high barriers to competition, little or no debt, substantial ownership by management, and large recurring income from products or services.  We prefer small companies because they can grow faster, and we prefer companies that are profitable now.
<BR>
<DT><B>Do all Cabot's stocks go up?</B>  
<DD>No.  No one picks winners all the time.  Sometimes your stocks will go down right after you buy them.  If they do, you should get out of them, keeping your losses small.  On the other hand, you should hold your winners as long as they are doing well, cultivating them with the hope of holding on for the huge profits that can develop over several years time.  In general, we feel we've done a good job if 60% of our stock picks end up as winners.  The key to success is letting the profits in your winners get larger while keeping your losses small.
<BR>
<DT><B>How do I know when to sell?</B>   
<DD>The most important rule in investing. . . . .and the hardest to learn is, "Cut your losses short."  That means if your loss exceeds 15% or 20% at the end of any trading day, you sell.  Period.  On the other hand, you will have many winners, and knowing when to sell them is more difficult.  In general, though, we believe it is wise to sell when a stock has underperformed the market for thirteen weeks.  The stock's RP (relative performance) line is a good indicator of this.
<BR>
<DT><B>Are there times when this rule should be broken?</B>  
<DD>Yes, there are exceptions, in particular involving Heritage Stocks.  These are stocks in which you already have doubled your money. . . . .or more. . . . .and still see the potential for great appreciation in the future.  In such cases, you should hang on to your stock through corrections, confident that the long-term results will prove rewarding.  If you can do this, you'll benefit mightily from the magic of compounding.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is so magic about compounding?</B>  
<DD>All right, it's not really magic.  But when you see the way it can turn a small amount of money into really big money, sometimes it seems like magic.  Consider this example.  You invest $10,000 in a stock.  Its price doubles in a year.  So you sell it, pay your capital gains taxes and invest in another stock.  That one doubles in a year, too.  So you sell it and pay your taxes and buy a third stock that also doubles in a year.  After paying your taxes (assume a 30% rate), you have $27, 440.  Not bad.  But what would happen if you simply hung on to one great stock, letting it triple in value over three years?  You would have $80,000 instead of $27,440.  It would still be growing. . . . .and you haven't paid a cent of taxes.  If you did finally sell the stock and paid your taxes, you would end up with an impressive $56,000.  That's over twice as much as in the first example, and the only difference is that you didn't sell and give your profits to the government.  You held on and your profits kept working for you.  That's the magic of compounding.
In plain English, you might say that money makes money.  And the money that money makes money.  Understanding the power of compounding is one of the keys to real success in the market.
<BR>
<DT><B>Is it smart to take my bet off the table once I double my money?</B>  
<DD>No.  On the surface, it looks like a way to reduce your risk.  And It's true.  You can't lose that money if It's not invested.  But neither can you use it to make more!  If you want to take advantage of the magic of compounding, you've got to leave that money invested. . . . .let your profits run. . . . .until you're convinced the stock's major growth phase is over.
<BR>
<DT><B>Is it risky to buy stocks hitting new highs?</B>  
<DD>In the long run, no.  Remember, a trend, once established, tends to persist.  So if you're convinced a stock's trend is up and you're convinced the business is capable of great earnings growth in the years ahead, you should buy.  Because the most likely trend is up!  At the root of this, you will generally find a shifting change in the public's perception of the company.  We call it sponsorship.  As more and more people come to develop improved opinions of the company, it's natural they will buy more of the stock and drive it to higher prices.  
<BR>
<DT><B>Why are earnings so important?</B>
<DD>Companies are in business to make money.  Thus, earnings are the ultimate score card.  Companies that can grow their earnings rapidly and do it repeatedly see their stock prices rise to reflect their success.  Conversely, companies that stumble on their growth path see the price of their stock fall.  Investors are always looking ahead to what they believe the company's earnings will be in the future.  Thus investors' perceptions of the company's prospects can be as important as the reality. . . . .in the short term.  But in the long run, earnings and earnings per share are most important.  To measure earnings per share, just divide earnings, usually for the last four quarters, by the number of shares of stock outstanding.  If a company reports earnings, or profit, of $5 million in a year and has 10 million shares outstanding, earnings per share (or eps) is $.50.  Remember, you own shares, so if the company can grow earnings while keeping the number of shares constant, the underlying value of your investment has increased.  But if the number of shares increases at the same time, (perhaps the company sells more shares because it needs more cash) the value of your holdings becomes diluted to a degree.  At the extreme, if earnings double but the number of shares also doubles, the underlying value of your investment has not improved.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a price/earnings ratio?</B>  
<DD>If you divide a company's stock price by its earnings per share, you'll come up with a price/earnings ratio, or PE.  This simple number reflects how well-thought-of the stock is by investors.  A single-digit PE is considered to be low, while a number over 20 is considered to be high.  If stocks were commodities, like bananas, a low price/earnings ratio would represent a bargain. . . . .a good value.  But at Cabot a high PE does not keep us from buying a strong stock.  Because stocks are not commodities.  When you buy a stock you are betting that earnings will grow in the future.  And a high PE is simply confirming that other investors as well believe your company will experience fast earnings growth in the future.
<BR>
<DT><B>Are investors always rational?</B>
<DD>No! While the long-term course of a stock's price will ultimately reflect earnings, its short-term course is highly dependent on investors' perceptions. . . . .and their emotions.  Investors, generally, can be motivated by fear or greed.  When they are fearful, they can sell a stock so that its price falls to unreasonably low levels.  And when investors are greedy, they can bid a stock's price up to unreasonable heights.  The challenge for the individual investor is to avoid getting caught up in the emotions of the crowd.
<BR>
<DT><B>Does The Cabot Market Letter ever advocate short-term investing?</B>  
<DD>No. All our recommended investments are made with the hope of holding on for years.  Admittedly, these hopes are not always fulfilled.  A stock can turn down much sooner than we expect, and we will recommend that you sell.  Losses can be hard to take, psychologically.  But they are the price you pay for finding the big winners. . . . .the ones that fulfill your hopes and even exceed them.  In short, you can't get rich with short-term winners.  Only long-term winners, combined with the magic of compounding, will do the trick.  In fact, when you invest for the long-term and you are able to hold the stock of a successful company over a period of years, you benefit from the unforeseeable and the incalculable.  That is, you reap the rewards of progress at the company that was totally unforeseen years before but was brought to fruition by capable management given time to do its work.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is short selling?</B>  
<DD>Short selling is the practice of borrowing shares of a stock so you can sell it (short), planning to buy it back later at a lower price. . . . .returning the shares and keeping the difference in price as your profit.  In brief, you're betting that the price will fall.  At Cabot, we do not recommend the practice, for a couple of good reasons.  First is the long-term trend of the market, which has been generally upward over the decades, even centuries.  When you invest (long) in a stock, you're investing in synch with the long-term trend.  But when you go short, you're betting that the stock you're shorting will move contrary to that long-term, upward market trend.  And you're betting that you're clever enough to time your entry and exit points to catch this move.  It's tricky.  
Equally important is the fact that the potential profits of a short-seller are limited.  If the stock's price falls to zero, the best you can do is double your money.  Contrast that with the potential of a fast-growing company that could triple your money, or more, in a year or two.  Conversely, on the long side the worst you can do is lose all the money you invested in that stock, while if you're short, your potential losses are unlimited!
<BR>
<DT><B>What is investing on margin?</B>  
<DD>Someday your broker may ask if you'd like to invest on margin.  In effect the broker is offering to lend you money so that you can invest it and profit from it.  The broker is a guaranteed winner, because you pay him interest on the money you borrow and he gets the commissions when you trade with that money.  But your profits will be harder to come by.  You've got to pay that interest and those commissions . . . . .and your risk is increased.  If you're doubled up on margin, for example, a simple stock drop of 10% will hand you a loss of 20%!  And a 20% drop will give you a 40% loss plus a headache.  In general, we don't recommend investing on margin.
<BR>
<DT><B>What are options?</B>  
<DD>An option gives you the right to buy or sell shares of a stock if it reaches a specified price by a set date.  On the surface, it seems a relatively inexpensive way to invest, with the promise of a big payoff if you're right.  Trouble is, you'll seldom be right.  Most times, your "investment" will disappear, leaving you with absolutely nothing.  And even if you do have profits, they'll be short-term.  As with short-selling, the argument is that not only must you be right about the direction the stock will move, you also must be right about the time.  It's far simpler and more rewarding to simply invest on the long side, patiently letting time work for you.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a bull market?</B>  
<DD>A bull market is a long period when most stocks are going up in price.  While there are no universally agreed upon methods of determining when a bull market exists, it is without doubt easier to make money in stocks when the major trend is up.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is a bear market?</B>  
<DD>A bear market is a long period when most stocks are declining in price.  It's tough to make money in bear markets.  Happily, they tend to be briefer than bull markets.  Over the very long term, the major trend of the market is up.
<BR>
<DT><B>What is market timing?</B>  
<DD>We are strong believers in long-term market timing. . . . .mainly so we can sell stocks and preserve cash when the broad market enters into a major decline.  This is not an exact science.  But it can be tremendously rewarding to avoid losing money.  And we've had great success with market timing over the years.  So we feel confident in recommending that all investors practice it.  On average, The Cabot Market Letter gives one major market timing signal per year.  If it's a sell signal, we work to reduce risk by selling our poorest performing stocks and putting close limits on the others.  The object is to reduce the risk of loss and to raise cash for the next buy signal, when bargains abound.  When that buy signal comes, we invest aggressively in the best-performing stocks we can find.  Interestingly, that's the time most investors are scared to death.
<BR>
<DT><B>Is it risky to invest when public sentiment is negative?</B>  
<DD>To the contrary, that's the best time of all!  The public, in general, tends to react to what has already happened and assumes that the past will continue.  Investors have no way of seeing the end of a trend until it's well behind them.  But we know that all trends end when the last holdout joins the crowd. . . . .when the last buyer buys or the last seller sells.  The trend ends when sentiment reaches an extreme level.  Then, because all the fuel for that trend is exhausted, the trend reverses.  In general, the better you are at gauging the mood of the crowd,  the more confident you will feel about buying when all about you have sold in panic. . . . .and moving to the sidelines when all about you are buying feverishly.
