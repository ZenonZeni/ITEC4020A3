<H3>Hotspots Map Offers Solutions<BR>To Global Species Extinction Crisis</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
Washington, D.C. --  Conservation International (CI) today released a new Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map that reveals more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial biological diversity is contained within less than 2 percent of the planet's land surface.
<P>
"While the world keeps hearing scientific predictions of species extinction crises,  we're saying it's time to put aside the gloom and doom and get down to the business at hand.  This new map makes the biodiversity crisis much more manageable,"  said Dr. Russell A. Mittermeier, CI President and an expert on primates and reptiles.
<P>
Based on an analysis carried out over the past year, CI's Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map lists 17 priority areas, occupying a total of less than 2 percent of the Earth's land surface.  Almost 40 percent of all  terrestrial plants and 25 percent of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these areas (i.e. found nowhere else).  When considering total species diversity in these areas, they claim more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity. 
<P>
British ecologist Norman Myers created the biodiversity hotspots concept in two scientific papers published in 1988 and 1990.  Myers recognized that a modest number of hotspot ecosystems covering a small total land area, most often in tropical forest areas, accounted for a high percentage of global biodiversity.  CI slightly revised the concept and adopted it as the organization's conservation strategy. The same year, the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation, a major private supporter of conservation initiatives, adopted the hotspots approach as its principal strategy for biodiversity investment.
<P> 	
"I wanted to know how we could get ahead of the game and determine which are the real priorities areas in the world," Myers said.  "I can think of no other biodiversity initiative that could achieve so much at such comparatively small cost, as the hotspots strategy."
<P>  
Two criteria were used to determine which areas qualify as a global biodiversity hotspot: number of endemic species and degree of threat.  Each of the priority hotspots claims at least 1 percent of the total diversity of vascular plants (those with roots and stems) as endemic, that is at least 2,500 species. Degree of threat was determined by the percentage of remaining habitat within a region, with each hotspot retaining less than 25 percent of its original natural habitat.
<P>
The top priority global biodiversity hotspots are:  
<UL>
<LI>the Tropical Andes (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia)
<LI>the island of Madagascar
<LI>Cape and Western Cape floristic region (South Africa)
<LI>the Antilles
<LI>Western Sunda region  (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei)
<LI>Eastern Sunda region (Indonesia)
<LI>the Philippines
<LI>the Atlantic forest (Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina)
<LI>Brazil's Cerrado
<LI>the Dari&eacute;n (Panama), the Choc&oacute; (Colombia-Ecuador), and Western Ecuador
<LI>Meso-American forests
<LI>Polynesia and Micronesian Island complex, including Hawaii and Fiji
<LI>Southwestern Australia
<LI>the Eastern Mediterranean region 
<LI>the Western Ghats (India) and the island of Sri Lanka
<LI>New Caledonia
<LI>the Guinean forests of West Africa (under final study)
</UL>
Another list of second-tier biodiversity hotspots is under preparation.  This list currently includes, in the United States, the California Floristic Province, which extends from southern Oregon to the Baja Peninsula.
<P>
"We are not saying focus only on these hotspots and ignore every thing else,"  said Mittermeier.  "Every nation's biodiversity is critically important to its future, and must be the most fundamental component of any national development strategy.  However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed on the planet, and some areas, particularly the tropics, harbor far greater concentrations of biodiversity. We recommend that these threatened hotspots receive international attention."
<P>
	As part of its conservation strategy, CI also recognizes the importance of  major tropical wilderness areas, such as Amazon.  The primary difference between hotspots and wilderness areas is the degree of threat.  Whereas less than 25 percent of natural vegetation remains in the hotspots (some have less than 10 percent of their original habitat), wilderness areas claim at least 75 percent undisturbed natural vegetation, with a human population density of no more than five persons per square kilometer. 
<P>
 "The Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map is powerful tool to help chart the course for biodiversity conservation, said Peter A. Seligmann, CI Board Chairman. "It can help guide investments through this critical era for life on Earth.  By demonstrating that something can actually be accomplished, we should be able to stimulate further investment, and encourage much greater involvement by the private sector, international aid agencies and development banks."
