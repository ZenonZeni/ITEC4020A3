Mass. Blue Cross' Medicare HMO First to Get Hit by
New HCFA Sanctions


HCFA has slapped intermediate sanctions on Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Massachusetts for "knowingly" including misleading
marketing information in its Medicare HMO application, according to
a HCFA source.
In freezing the enrollment and marketing functions of Blue Cross'
"Blue Care 65" HMO product, the action represents the first time
HCFA has levied intermediate sanctions on a Medicare risk-contract
HMO.
The sanctions are expected to take effect in March and stay in
place pending the outcome of a HCFA investigation, the agency
source told MCW. 
Blue Cross apparently claimed a number of non-contracted physicians
were in the Blue Care 65 provider network, the source says.
But the insurer expects to have the problem rectified before the
sanctions take effect, Evelyn Murphy, vice president for corporate
affairs for Blue Cross, told MCW.
Murphy says Blue Cross itself brought the matter to HCFA's
attention after discovering that 25-30 documents had been "altered"
in the insurer's application to the agency. Most of the
non-contracted MDs have since signed contracts with the Blues plan,
she adds.
Blue Cross recently got HCFA approval to offer a Medicare HMO in
Massachusetts in 1996. In fact, the plan just started marketing its
product late last month to seniors throughout the state.
Blue Care 65 is a zero-premium Medicare HMO.

Penn. Medicaid Program to Mandate 438,000 into
Managed Care Plans


In its first step toward a statewide program, Pennsylvania this
month drafted a plan to mandate 438,000 Medicaid recipients into
HMOs in five counties surrounding Philadelphia.
The initiative, dubbed "HealthChoices," is part of a statewide
mandatory managed care program to be phased in over the next three
years. The state has had a limited mandatory program for 100,000
Philadelphia Medicaid recipients since 1986.
Pennsylvania got a Sec. 1915(b) Medicaid waiver from HHS to set up
"HealthChoices" in 1993 under then-Gov. Bob Casey (D). But the plan
was criticized by some groups for lacking Medicaid HMO regulations
and implementation was delayed. A class action lawsuit over the
proposal is still pending.
Incoming Gov. Tom Ridge (R) made a number of changes to
HealthChoices before the state issued a draft request for proposals
(RFP) this month. HMO bids will be awarded in the summer, open
enrollment will begin Aug. 6, and the program will start Nov. 1.
HMO enrollment will be phased in, with coverage for certain groups
like AFDC recipients starting Nov. 1. Remaining eligibles will be
folded in on July 1, 1997. Medicaid recipients targeted for 1997
entry may voluntarily join HMOs sooner. 
Recipients who don't select an HMO within a specified time period
will be randomly assigned to a plan.
To address criticisms lobbed at the initial HealthChoices proposal,
the department will:

o       Ban HMO direct marketing, such as
door-to-door solicitation, and instead have a benefits consultant
conduct enrollment activities.
o       Carve out behavioral health services
for a separate procurement process. Counties will be given the
first rights of refusal to manage mental health-substance abuse
treatment benefits before a private capitated contractor is picked.
o       Require HMOs to submit encounter
data and comply with Medicaid HEDIS (MCW 2/5/96, p. 3).
o       Capitate HMOs, build in an allowable
profit margin, and link performance and outcome measures to profit
levels. This addresses concerns about the Philadelphia Medicaid
program, whose private contractor was found by the HHS Inspector
General to have made  excessive profits. That program is
scheduled to terminate Oct. 31.
o       Make direct payments to hospitals
for disproportionate share and graduate medical education instead
of including them in the HMO capitation.

HMOs' Voluntary Compliance Squelches Colo. Maternity Bill


Colorado's HMOs and insurers convinced a state legislator to pull
her mandatory maternity stay bill after the health plans agreed to
voluntarily comply with the provisions.
The bill would have required health plans to cover 48 hours of
hospital care following a normal delivery and 96 hours following a
Caesarean section.
Last year, four states enacted similar laws, and a fifth adopted
the mandate by regulation.
The Group Health Assn. of America/American Managed Care and Review
Assn. expects similar activity this year in at least 14 states
(MCW's Managed Care Perspectives 1/29/96, p. 3).
The HMOs and insurers that agreed to voluntarily comply represent
95% of the market. The health plans agreed:

o       Not to require reauthorization for
maternity and newborn inpatient care for at least 48 hours after
delivery.
o       To apply guidelines issued by the
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American
Academy of Pediatrics on utilization reviews and authorization
requests.
o       To conduct maternity policy
education programs for pregnant women, new mothers, pediatricians,
family physicians and OB-GYNs.

Through various concessions in recent years, Colorado insurers and
HMOs have fought off several other legislative attempts, including
any-willing-pharmacy and any-willing-provider laws.
Separately, Maryland's doctors earlier this month agreed not to
push for a state any-willing-provider law after HMOs made various
concessions, including disclosure of economic credentialling
criteria. 
The Maryland HMOs also agreed to revise provider contracts to
clarify that physicians won't be penalized for making certain
public statements about the health plans.

Medicare Adding Procedures To Bundled Payment Demo


A Medicare bundled payment demonstration project that HCFA expects
to announce within the next two months will be expanded to include
several orthopedic and cardiology procedures.
HCFA has already tested this centers-of-excellence concept on
bypasses and cataracts, but those demos are expiring this year.
Under the upcoming cardiology pilot, the agency will pay facilities
a negotiated bundled rate to cover both hospital and physician
services for heart bypasses, angioplasties, valve replacements and
catheterizations. The new orthopedic demo will cover total hip and
knee joint replacements.
Hospitals can participate in either the cardiology or the
orthopedic demo, or both. The bundled payment will account for
outlier cases; separate payments won't be made for particularly
expensive patients.
HCFA hasn't decided on the number of sites, but most likely will
choose facilities in a region comprised of several contiguous
states. The sites will be well-dispersed throughout the region. The
agency will use qualitative data to choose participating hospitals,
with price "way down the line," says a HCFA official.
Pre-applications will be sent in March or April to all hospitals
that routinely perform the procedures in the chosen region. HCFA
hopes to select hospitals by late 1996 and have the first sites
operating by early 1997.
The scope of the demo could change if bundled payment for Medicare
services is enacted as part of budget reconciliation.

Mayo's Jacksonville Clinic, Ga. IDS Seeking HMO Licenses


The Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., intends to file for an HMO
license by May, while a Georgia integrated delivery system (IDS)
that came under fire for accepting capitated payments will apply
for an HMO license this week.
Mayo thus becomes one of the latest and most prestigious provider
organizations to form its own health plan, a trend that is
spreading like wildfire (MCW 10/9/95, p. 4).
The clinic already contracts with more than a dozen managed care
plans that send over 10,000 patients a month to Mayo. By forming
its own HMO, Mayo will have another option to offer patients. Mayo
hopes to offer the HMO in northeast Florida by September.
Mayo's Jacksonville clinic has 30 primary care MDs among its 170
doctors. Mayo will honor its contracts with other managed care
plans.
In Atlanta, Promina Health System, which claims to be Georgia's
largest community-based, nonprofit health system, will apply for an
HMO license this week and hopes to have the plan up and running by
January 1997. The IDS is plunging into the HMO market because the
state requires licensure of provider entities that take capitation
from self-funded employers.
Last year Promina scrapped its capitated arrangement with Cobb
County after state regulators rapped the IDS' knuckles for
accepting capitation without an HMO or insurance license (MCW
7/10/95, p. 4).
Promina initially will offer the HMO to its own 13,000 workers and
to public employers. Promina may later solicit private employer
contracts. But only a small portion of Promina patients will be in
its HMO; the majority will be members of other health plans that
contract with the IDS for health services.
The Promina HMO will capitate primary care MDs, specialists and
hospitals. Providers will be free to join other plans.

WellPoint, Trigon Struggle With Charitable Obligations


Blue Cross of California and Trigon Blue Cross-Blue Shield in
Virginia are grappling with their public charity obligations as
they convert to for-profit publicly traded companies.
California Blue Cross last week said it will recapitalize its
for-profit, publicly traded managed care spinoff, WellPoint Health
Networks, so the Blues plan can contribute all its assets to two
new charitable foundations and resolve its public charity
obligations.
The move involves an "upstream merger" in which WellPoint will buy
Blue Cross of California's remaining commercial business, acquire
the rights to the Blue Cross name and mark in California, and gain
about 310,000 PPO members. WellPoint has 2.8 million PPO,
point-of-service and HMO enrollees.
WellPoint stockholders will get a cash dividend of $10 per share,
followed by a two-for-three reverse stock split. Total cash
proceeds to WellPoint's largest stockholder, Blue Cross, will
exceed $1 billion.
Blue Cross, which owns 80 million shares in WellPoint, will
transfer $1 billion in cash to one foundation, and about $2 billion
worth of stock, or 80.4% of the stock in the new WellPoint, to the
second foundation. That's similar to the $3 billion the two
foundations would have received if WellPoint and Blue Cross had
merged with Health Systems International Inc. (MCW 1/1/96, p. 4).
The recapitalization is subject to approval by the Calif.
Department of Corporations and by stockholders other than Blue
Cross.
Meanwhile, Trigon Blue Cross-Blue Shield recently filed an amended
conversion plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission.
The amended plan incorporates a recent agreement with the state's
Attorney General to allocate $165 million to public charity when
Trigon converts from a not-for-profit, taxable mutual insurance
company to a publicly traded stock company (MCW 12/18/95, p. 4).
The amended plan would set aside $165 million in a special class of
stock for public or charitable uses.
Trigon originally was going to give all policyholders as of May 31,
1995, the company's value in the form of stock. The amended plan
would allow eligible policyholders to be those on record as of Dec.
31, 1995.
But the Virginia legislature is debating the state budget and the
amount of Trigon public charity funds. Several legislators want to
increase the Blues' public charity obligation to at least $175
million.
The State Corporation Commission has set a May 6 hearing on the
Trigon plan. The insurer covers nearly 1 million PPO, POS and HMO
enrollees and 800,000 indemnity lives.

GHAA/AMCRA Changes Name, Courts PPOs, UR Firms


The Group Health Assn.of America/American Managed Care and Review
Assn. is changing its name to the American Assn. of Health Plans,
subject to board approval Feb. 25.
The trade group didn't want "managed care" in the new title because
field testing found the term has a negative connotation in the
public's mind, several board members told MCW.
In addition to the name change, the merged trade association is
reaching out to all managed care organizations, including
utilization review firms and PPOs, "though there's still some fight
against that from the old [HMO] guard" within GHAA, says one board
member.
To reflect its expanded mission, the association has put on its
board Robert Patricelli, chairman-CEO of Value Health Inc., a
national specialty managed care company, and Marcus Merz, president
of Preferred One, a Minneapolis PPO firm.

Mortality, Hospital Costs Drop As Managed Care
Spreads 


Hospitals in cities with high managed care penetration report lower
costs, reduced length of stays and decreased mortality rates,
according to a study by KPMG Peat Marwick consultants of Los
Angeles.
The national study of 11.7 million patients at 3,700 acute-care
facilities found that hospital costs in highly penetrated managed
care markets were 11% below the national average and 19% below
hospital costs in low managed care markets.
In markets with high managed care penetration, hospital stays were
6.3% shorter than the national average and almost 12% shorter than
stays in medium managed care markets.
And the risk-adjusted mortality rates in high managed care markets
were 5.25% below the national average.
Although managed care is driving down hospital costs without
negatively affecting patient care, hospital costs were flat or
starting to rise in many highly penetrated managed care markets,
notes Michael Hamilton, national director of KPMG Peat Marwick's
health care group.
For details, call Debbie Dalmand at KPMG: (714) 850-4440.

24 States Mandate or Regulate Workers' Comp
Managed Care


About 24 states either regulated or mandated the use of managed
care organizations for workers' compensation coverage as of January
1995, according to a study by the Workers Compensation Research
Institute of Cambridge, Mass.
The survey of state workers' compensation officials also revealed
that eight states mandated  managed care to treat injured
workers, 35 states limited a worker's initial choice of provider,
and 38 states limited a worker's ability to switch providers. Other
findings:

o       Some 40 states used fee schedules
for managed care providers;
o       Hospital payments for workers' comp
care were regulated by 35 states;
o       Utilization review for workers' comp
care was mandated by 21 states;
o       Bill review was mandated by 16
states; and
o       About 12 states used treatment
guidelines.

Physician Practices Worth More In High Managed
Care Markets


Physician practices sell for more money in communities with high
managed care penetration, according to the Center for Healthcare
Industry Performance Studies.
High managed care markets were defined as those with at least 52.2%
managed care penetration, while low managed care markets were
defined as those with less than 40% of the population in managed
care plans. 
The median value per physician for practices in high managed care
markets was $106,000 in 1994, but only $95,000 in low managed care
markets. Practices in medium managed care markets were valued at
$134,000 per MD. The study covered 245 physician practice
acquisitions representing more than 650 doctors.

Book, contact Patrick Knott at (614) 457-1777.

Success of IPA, Network HMOs Not Linked to Care
Quality


HMO success isn't strongly linked to quality of care provided, and
plans with relatively bad reputations continue to grow, finds a
Commonwealth Fund study of IPA- and network-model HMOs.
The case studies of six unidentified HMOs in Boston, Los Angeles
and Philadelphia found that the most financially successful HMOs
each had a provider-friendly and physician-focused philosophy;
decentralized medical management; stable management; and a primary
focus on developing IPA/network HMO business.
Size and financial backing, often by large indemnity-based
insurers, wasn't necessarily an advantage. Among the study's other
findings:

o       The HMOs in the three markets
increasingly are shifting risk to providers.
o       Employer demands to contract with
fewer plans that cover broader markets are increasing market
pressures that favor size over past performance.
o       Pressure to grow appears more
motivated by being in a position to exert market power than by
gains in a plan's ability to provide quality care or invest in
internal systems.

As competition intensifies, there is a critical need for readily
available, quality-of-care measures, but consolidating markets will
make it increasingly difficult to rely on meaningful choice to
ensure quality, the study concludes.

State Employees Offered More HMOs in 1995


State-employed workers were offered a total of 375 HMOs last year,
up from 350 in 1991, says a study by the Segal Co. consultants of
New York.
In 1995, 35% of state workers were in HMOs, up from 29% in 1991.
Last year, 11 states enrolled more than 50% of state employees in
HMOs, led by Arizona (88%); California (86%); Missouri (74%);
Wisconsin (72%); and Delaware (66%).
But 12 states had less than 10% of state workers enrolled in HMOs,
and six states had no state employees in HMOs.
The average monthly HMO premium for January 1995 was $170 for
individual state workers and $414 for families. 
As of January 1995, 46 states offered a PPO. In 28 of these states,
the PPO was part of an indemnity plan and was available at the
worker's discretion at the point-of-service. The PPO was separate
in 12 states, and the worker had to choose a primary care physician
at the time of plan enrollment.

Oxford Shines, HIP Stumbles, Says New York
Public Advocate


Oxford Health Plans Inc. ranked nearly tops with New York City
consumers while the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP)
had the worst overall public complaints record and customer service
phone lines of 12 HMOs studied.
Mark Green, public advocate for New York City, studied HMOs by
Aetna, ChoiceCare, Cigna, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, HIP,
Oxford, Managed Health Inc., Prudential, Travelers, MetLife, Sanus
and U.S. Healthcare. 
From 1991 through 1994, HIP was the only HMO to rank in the bottom
one-third in public complaints each year. From 1992 to 1994, some
49.5% of complaints against the HMO were upheld by the state, while
only 20% of complaints against ChoiceCare and 25% of those against
Sanus were upheld.
Green also found that HIP by far had the longest delays in
answering phones, with typical delays of 10 minutes.
By contrast, Oxford had the highest percentage of board-certified
physicians, the highest MD renewal rate, and the second-longest
customer service hours. 
Oxford also had the fastest growth rate of all plans studied. From
year-end 1990 through June 1995, Oxford's membership increased from
28,000 to 595,600.
For the first half of 1995, the amount spent on physicians per
member ranged from $30.61 per month at Empire HealthNet to $83.77
at a Travelers HMO. January 1996 monthly premiums for individuals
ranged from $172.50 at Managed Health to $257.59 at ChoiceCare.

California's HMOs Show Widely Varying
Utilization


Utilization varies greatly among California HMOs, according to a
study by the Center for Health Care Rights in Los Angeles.
The study focused on the state's 18 HMOs that had Medicaid
contracts. Twelve of the 18 plans failed to include utilization
data for all or some of their membership groups. 
Of plans that reported relevant data, the average number of
physician encounters per member in California's so-called Medi-Cal
program during 1994 ranged from 0.37 in Universal Care's HMO to
5.14 in Kaiser's southern California region.
For the HMOs' commercial members, the average number of MD
encounters per member ranged from 0.21 for Universal Care to 8.53
for FHP's staff-model plan. MD encounters per member for Medicare
beneficiaries ranged from 4.11 for United Health Plan to 26.43 for
FHP's staff-model HMO.
Overall, the weighted average number of physician encounters per
member for plans that reported data was 3.5 for Medi-Cal members,
3.26  for commercial enrollees, and 9.19 for Medicare members.
The average number of non-physician encounters per member, as well
as annual hospital stays per 1,000 enrollees and average length of
stay, also varied widely among HMOs. 
The study concluded that plans appear to collect and report
utilization data inconsistently to the state, and that California's
Department of Corporations apparently fails to check the accuracy
of reported data.

California's Nonprofit HMOs Have Highest Medical
Loss Ratios 


The five California HMOs with the highest medical loss ratios were
all nonprofit plans, according to a study by the California Medical
Assn.
Of the five HMOs with the lowest loss ratios, four were for-profit
plans.
The California HMOs that spent the largest percentage of premiums
on medical care were:

o       Kaiser Foundation Health Plan
(96.8%); 
o       Santa Barbara Regional Health
Initiative (95.1%);
o       Blue Cross of California (93.4%);
o       Solano Partnership Health Plan
(89.3%); and
o       Contra Costa Health Plan (89.1%).
The California HMOs with the lowest medical loss ratios were:
o       CaliforniaCare Health Plans (73%),
owned by Blue Cross of California;
o       Molina Medical Centers (75.8%);
o       Community Health Group, the only
nonprofit plan with one of the five lowest medical loss ratios
(75.9%);
o       Aetna Health Plans of California
Inc. (77.4%); and
o       Foundation Health Plans Inc.
(77.4%), a publicly traded company.

Nonprofit HMOs generally want high medical loss ratios, while
for-profits want to keep ratios low, some experts note. 
Many industry experts argue that medical loss ratios by themselves
are not an accurate indicator of an HMO's efficiency or performance
(MCW 1/8/96, p. 3).
Among plans with 20,000 or more enrollees, California's for-profit
HMOs had a medical loss ratio averaging 81% and posted profits
amounting to 4.6% of premiums. 
Nonprofits averaged an 86.8% medical loss ratio with profits of
2.9% of revenue.

Assn.: (916) 444-5532.

Maternity Stay Lengths Shrink For Women in Twin
Cities 


The percentage of one-day maternity stays in the Twin Cities area
increased nearly seven-fold between 1985 and 1995, according to a
study by the Minnesota Hospital and Healthcare Partnership.
Last year, four states required insurers and managed care plans to
cover 48-hour hospital stays for newborns and their mothers for
regular childbirths, 96 hours for Caesarean sections (MCW's
Perspectives 1/29/96).
The analysis of 360,000 maternity discharges revealed that, for all
vaginal and Caesarean sections, including those with complications,
the average length of stay dropped from 2.94 days in 1985 to 2.17
days in 1995.
 From 1985 to 1995, the average length of stay for women with
uncomplicated vaginal deliveries dropped from 2.42 days to 1.72
days. During that same period, average length of stay for
uncomplicated Caesarean deliveries dropped from 4.57 days to 3.53
days.
In the first quarter of 1995, 42.5% of women with uncomplicated
vaginal deliveries had one-day stays, up from 6.2% in 1985.
Overall, women with private managed care and indemnity coverage had
a higher percentage of one-day stays than did uninsured women or
Medicaid recipients. Over the 10-year period, lengths of stay for
women with commercial indemnity coverage generally tracked that of
women with private managed care coverage.

Medicare HMO Members Satisfied In Southern
California


Some 70% of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in five Medicare
risk-contract HMOs are highly satisfied with their plan, according
to a study by CareData Reports Inc. of New York.
And 81% of surveyed enrollees intended to re-enroll in their
Medicare HMO.
The 2,673 beneficiaries surveyed were enrolled in Medicare HMOs
offered by FHP, Health Net, Kaiser Foundation Health Plans,
Maxicare and PacifiCare in Southern California. The survey covered
member satisfaction with primary care physicians, specialists,
disease prevention and treatment, administration, pharmacy benefits
and other health plan components.
Dr. Tod Cooperman, president of CareData, says seniors like
Medicare HMOs because:

o       They value the extra benefits, like
prescription drug coverage, that are not covered by
fee-for- service (FFS) Medicare;
o       They find HMOs less administratively
burdensome than the traditional Medicare program; and
o       They believe their health status is
improving under the care provided by HMOs.

Of the five HMOs studied, Kaiser's scored highest for total
satisfaction, with 80% of members reporting they were at least very
satisfied.
Overall, 53% of those surveyed who previously were in FFS Medicare
rated their HMO as better than FFS, 20% rated the two systems
equally, and 27% preferred FFS.

Studies in Brief


o       Little correlation has been found
between a metropolitan area's HMO market penetration and the
utilization of CAT scans, MRIs, cardiac catheterization and nuclear
medicine services, according to a study by the Technology Marketing
Group of Des Plains, Ill. For details, call John Vanden Brink:
(708) 297-1404.
o       Nearly 20% of 620 employers use
centers of excellence to help control health costs, according to a
study by Watson Wyatt Worldwide consultants in Washington, D.C.
Some 29% of employers with 2,500 or more workers used such centers,
while only 8% of companies with less than 500 employees did. For
details, call Bob McKee at Watson Wyatt: (202) 508-4848.
o       The U.S. per capita cost (USPCC) for
Medicare aged beneficiaries increased from $297.33 in 1991 to
$440.90 in 1996, according to a report by Coopers & Lybrand
consulting firm of Washington, D.C. The USPCC is used to calculate
the adjusted average per capita cost amounts that serve as the
basis for paying Medicare risk HMOs. For details, call Susan Palsbo
at Coopers & Lybrand: (202) 822-4000.
o       Liver transplants managed by United
Resource Networks, a subsidiary of United HealthCare Corp. of
Minneapolis, saved purchasers and consumers 33% per transplant
procedure, the company claims. The study also revealed that
United's transplant patients had one and two-year survival rates
that were higher than the national averages. For details, call
Kirsten Simning at United HealthCare: (612) 992-5137.

Admar PPO, Hancock POS Test Risk Pools, Bonuses to
Boost Physician Performance


While capitation is the dominant method for HMOs to shift financial
risk to providers, Admar Corp., a PPO company, and John Hancock
Insurance Co.'s point-of-service (POS) plan are testing innovative
provider risk-sharing mechanisms.
Santa Ana, Calif.-based Admar holds providers in its HMO-type
product to overall performance budgets, while John Hancock's
point-of-service (POS) product pays physicians under a negotiated
fee schedule with two bonus incentive pools.
Admar is one of a few cutting-edge PPOs that are forming HMO-type
products and sharing risk with providers (MCW's Stats & Facts
11/13/95, p. 1). Admar's product is available in California and
Arizona.
Admar's fully insured "Exclusive Health" product, which is about
one and one-half years old, uses primary care gatekeepers and is
offered through an insurance carrier partner, says Richard Toral,
CEO-chairman.
 An overall provider performance budget is set by the payer, with
the budget segregated into risk pools for different categories of
providers. The pools are funded by a portion of the payer's
premiums.
Where Admar doesn't capitate providers, it sets up separate risk
pools for primary care physicians, specialty physicians and
hospitals. Where the company capitates only primary care MDs, it
sets up pools for specialists and hospitals. The pools are adjusted
for the payer group's enrollee age and sex.
Actual utilization is measured against each provider risk pool. If
providers stay within the allotted performance budget, they may get
bonuses at year-end.
Admar is scheduled to be acquired this month by Principal Health
Care Inc., the managed care subsidiary of Principal Financial Group
(MCW 11/6/95, p. 4).

Providers Like Bonus Pool Concept

Separately, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. uses two bonus
incentive pools for MDs in its "Signature Health Advantage" POS
product. The POS plan is being sold with a July 1 effective date to
self-insured employers in three markets - Dallas, Houston and
Cleveland.
The carrier contracts with physicians under a fee schedule. In
addition, MDs are eligible for bonus pools:

o        One bonus pool for primary care
doctors pays year-end bonuses based on an MD's individual
performance. The performance formula incorporates the MD's actual
claims costs; quality indicators, such as the physician's treatment
patterns and member satisfaction results; and compliance with
overall plan rules, such as utilization review and specialty
referral notifications. The pool is funded by a percentage of the
administrative-services-only fee an employer pays Hancock for the
POS plan.
o        A second provider incentive fund for
all physicians pays year-end bonuses to both primary care MDs and
specialists based on a separate performance formula, such as how
well a specialist meets quality indicators and controls
utilization. The employer funds the pool based on a percentage of
claims paid.

Hancock already has several contracts for the POS product with
PHOs, IPAs and group practices.
Providers have been receptive to Hancock's approach because it
"gives them a real chance to collect on the bonuses," according to
Lyn Rosenstein, Hancock's director of network product management.
Docs view the pools as financial incentives, she adds. Hancock is
not using payment withholds.
In effect, the POS plan aligns incentives for providers and Hancock
through performance guarantees to employers. If an employer's
claims costs exceed the guarantee, some doctors may not get bonuses
and the pool funds go back to the employer, Rosenstein notes.
Bonuses aren't common in PPOs but will grow in popularity, adds
Brant Kelch, president of MedStrategies consulting firm in Vienna,
Va., and co-founder of the American Assn. of Preferred Provider
Organizations. He says other forms of risk-sharing PPOs are trying
include capitation of providers without getting an HMO license, and
global pricing of physician and hospital services.

572-6390.

HMO Puts IDS at Full Risk For Plan's Medicare Population


Pittsburgh's HealthAmerica HMO has chosen a newly formed
integrated delivery system (IDS) as the provider for the
plan's fledging Medicare HMO product.
HealthAmerica thus becomes the region's first HMO to put a provider
organization fully at risk.
Under the HMO's new "Advantra" Medicare HMO, Southwest Integrated
Delivery Network will take on the entire medical risk of the new
product offering on a percentage of premium basis.
While most provider groups first experience full risk through a
health plan's commercial members, Southwest Integrated is bucking
the trend by first taking on full risk for Medicare enrollees. The
contract represents the IDS' first venture with HealthAmerica.
Southwest Integrated says it's simply a matter of timing that
Medicare risk is its first fully capitated deal.
Taking on risk for seniors can be tricky for any provider
organization because of the special needs of seniors. To properly
take on such risk, providers must change their focus and
operations, experts say (PCC 7/24/95, p. 3; 6/26/95, p. 3).
Western Pennsylvania has the second-oldest Medicare population in
the nation, and a high percentage of the region's residents are
seniors, says James Fritz, president and CEO of Southwest
Integrated.
As part of the Medicare risk contract with Southwest Integrated,
HealthAmerica is negotiating a similar full-risk contract with the
IDS for the plan's commercial products, which have 250,000 members.
 In fact, Southwest Integrated's Medicare contract with
HealthAmerica dictates that both parties will attempt to strike
such an agreement within 90 days to serve HealthAmerica's
commercial membership.
However, if such a deal is not reached, the Medicare agreement will
stand, says Dan Lebish, executive vice president for the HMO's
medical delivery systems. 
HealthAmerica has held separate per-diem contracts with the five
hospitals that make up Southwest Integrated, according to Lebish.
The HMO also has held individual capitated contracts with most of
the 210 primary care MDs involved in the IDS, as well as fee
schedule-based contracts with the 700 specialists in the Southwest
Integrated group, Fritz and Lebish say.

Details of the Full-Risk Contract

Other provisions in the deal:

o        Southwest Integrated is at risk
for visits by Medicare enrollees to roughly 800 non-Southwest
Integrated specialists in HealthAmerica's overall provider network.
o        The health plan delegated the
medical management piece to the IDS. The ability to control medical
management is key for Southwest Integrated, Fritz says.
o        The HMO will provide on-site
assistance to help Southwest Integrated manage utilization.
o        The contract prevents Southwest
Integrated from starting an HMO. But the IDS can deal with
other plans.
o        Southwest Integrated can access
the HMO's care management programs, which link members to
psychosocial providers. 
o        The parties will collaborate on
clinical studies on conditions that afflict the elderly and
disabled.
