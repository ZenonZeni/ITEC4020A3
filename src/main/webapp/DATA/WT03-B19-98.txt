Gimps and the GOP - Tuesday, August 13
</title>

<body>

<h3>Tuesday, Aug. 13</h3>
<h2>Jumping Through Hoops</h2>

<p>SAN DIEGO - Today was Disability Day for Bob Dole.  After a breakfast with disabled athletes, the senator addressed a group of about a hundred people with disabilities and then watched a demonstration by Canine Companions for Independence, an organization for the training of service dogs.
<p>Gimps, animals, and TV cameras.  Pure photo op.  Pure politics.  You even got a chance to see Dole cuddle a puppy.  (A sight that has to be seen to be believed.  Remember Michael Dukakis in the tank?  This was weirder.)
<p>During his remarks, Dole restated his support of the Americans with Disabilities Act and said he would continue efforts to protect the act from congressional attempts to water it down.  Later, when he was asked about the announcement by Justin Dart, Jr. - regarded by many people with disabilities as the "father of the ADA" - that he would be voting for President Clinton, Dole's only response was, "Well, obviously he can vote for whoever he wants."
<p>Dole doesn't do cuddly very well.
<hr>
<p>Is Dole simply using the disability community to advance his campaign, as quite a few critics - disabled and nondisabled - have charged?
<p>Of course he is.  But at the risk of sounding even more cynical than usual, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing.  Using people is what politics is about, after all - and when you're seeking votes in a democratic society, it's what makes politics important.
<p>What does a Presidential candidate do to court the Jewish vote, or the Italian vote, or the youth vote?  He goes to New York and puts on a yarmulka.  He goes to Chicago and chows down a lot of thick-crust pizza.  He goes on MTV and lets Tabitha Soren ask him a bunch of easy questions.  And if he does enough of it, he forces his opponent to do the same, lest he be accused of ignoring an important group of voters.  Thus, the group being courted - and the voters belonging to that group - becomes an important force in the democratic process.
<p>Hell, I'm waiting for Clinton to find a puppy of his own to cuddle, or to take a ride in a scooter with CNN looking on, or to do something equally goofy.  If both the Democratic and Republican candidates start jumping through hoops for our benefit, we'll know we've arrived.
