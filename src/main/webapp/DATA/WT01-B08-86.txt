        panel named by the government of the Falklands /Malvinas
        has began in London the round of interviews with the six
        consortia who applied for oil licences in the
        Falklands/Malvinas. The six consortia represent a total
        of fourteen companies from ten different countries. The
        panel of five members and their advisers will closely
        examine details of the bids for ten tranches in the
        prospective off shore oil fields mostly to the north of
        the islands. A final report is expected to be drafted by
        mid September when it will be considered by the
        Legislative Council in Stanley. Once the Governor adds
        his signature the report will be sent back to London for
        final approval by the Foreign Office. The consortia will
        have to show a sustainable work programme, financial
        stability, a reliable record and the best commercial
        package for the islands. Oil companies are expected to
        begin operating in the Falklands waters by next summer.</strong> </p>

        <p><strong>The actor Paul Newman has donated u$s 40,000
        to a charity set up by British Falkland&nbsp;/ Malvinas
        war veteran Simon Weston, Weston, Weston, who was badly
        burned during an Argentine air attack in 1982,
        established The Weston Spirit, to perpetuate the spirit
        of determination that enable him to recover from injuries
        that left him permanently scarred. Teh charity operates a
        network of centres where young people from poverty
        stricken urban areas are helped to pursue studies and
        careers away from crime. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Paul Newman's gift comes from the profits of
        the star's successful food company. The funds will be
        used to set up a new youth centre in London's East End.
        Mewman was not able to be present at the ceremony where
        his cheque was handed over, but a representative had this
        message from the star&nbsp;; &quot;Simon's dedication and
        commitment to youth provides a very neccesary
        programme&quot;. Newman's own charitable programme has
        set up the Hole In the Wall Gang Camps in the USA,
        Ireland and France, where in, disabled and disadvantaged
        children enjoy activity holidays. </strong></p>

        Falklands/Malvinas - Chile/Britain link are been held in
        Santiago de Chile . These include the possibility of
        medical evacuations to Santiago and an increased air
        freight capacity with the removal of some passenger seats
        in the Chilean Boeing 727. The air link presently
        includes a weekly flight PuntaArenas/Stanley/Punta Arenas
        by the Chilean carrier DAP, in time to meet British
        Airways in Santiago for the London runs. </strong></p>

        <p><strong>The Chilean company owner of the vessel
        &#147;Antonio Lorenzo&#148; which was fined a total of £
        367.000 on July 9th. for illegal fishing in South Georgia
        waters, has refused to pay and has reported the incident
        to the Chilean diplomatic authorities. The refusal to pay
        comes as a result of the Pesquero Concar's S.A.
        non-recognition of South Georgia's jurisdiction in the
        200 mile limit imposed around the islands and the fact
        that Chile is a member of CAMELAR, an international
        Conference for the Conservation of Marine Antartic
        Resources which covers. <br>
        The case attracted international attention because of the
        presence as counsel for the prosecution of a Senior
        Barrister QC, fuelling speculation that the case would
        derive into a challenge of British sovereignty over South
        Georgia. This was the second time the &#147;Antonio
        Lorenzo&#148; faced Court proceedings in Stanley since in
        1994 they were fined £ 74.000. </strong></p>
