TOOLS OF THE TRADE:  THE FEDERAL REGISTER

The Federal Register -- the federal government's 60-year-old
regulatory affairs reporter -- remains a key grantseeking
tool, even in the electronic age.

The Register last month announced free access to its own
searchable electronic version.

And despite increased use of the Internet by agencies to
advertise funding opportunities directly, the Register is
the forum of choice for certain health-related funders.

In addition to running grant notices, the Register also
updates readers daily on critical rules, regulations and
actions that shape grant competitions.

By following official developments, grantseekers can stay on
top of changes that could affect their eligibility under a
grant program or effect new procedures and requirements.

In its electronic form, readers can have a custom-tailored
Register.  Instead of slogging through pages of extraneous
text, readers can go straight to notices from agencies of
interest.


"It's what they've always asked for," says Richard
Claypoole, director of the Federal Register.

And the electronic version has caught on, he says.  Even
before the Register went public,  subscribers logged 558,369
document retrievals from 103,722 searches from November to
December.

In whatever form, grantseekers can use the Federal Register
to:

*  Mine grant nuggets:  The Health Resources and Services
Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Energy
Department regularly use the Federal Register to announce
grant competitions.

Browsers will find health-related Education Department
notices and health and life science notices from the
Agriculture Department and the Environmental Protection
Agency.

*  Check on winners:  A few agencies, such as the Housing
and Urban Development Department, use the Federal Register
to announce recent awards.  Announcements are occasional,
but they can provide insights about program constituents and
reveal subgrant and subcontracting possibilities.

*  Respond to proposed program rules and funding priorities:
Laws creating grant programs often require agencies to
publish regulations before getting down to grantmaking.
Grantseekers can influence program direction by commenting
on the proposals appearing in the Federal Register.

*  Keep up with grant-related policies:  The Register
provides the full text on government-wide policies affecting
grants and contracts, such as Office of Management and
Budget circulars related to university research costs.

*In fact, revisions to OMB Circular A-21, which deals with
university costs, could hit the Register late this month.

*  Learn about meetings:  Agencies publish announcements for
meetings, ranging from preapplication workshops and advisory
group sessions to policy-setting forums, including meetings
on grantseekers' home turf.  Notices specify when and where
meetings will be held and which parts will be open to the
public.

But the Federal Register also has its drawbacks -- for hard
copy and electronic users.  Agencies used to soliciting
grant applications via the Register sometimes bypass the
publication these days, finding it faster and easier to go
with electronic announcements.

For example, EPA's 1996 grant competition, announced on the
Internet last month, has yet to make it into the Register.
Unless their announcements have regulatory impact, says
Claypoole, agencies are not required to publish application
notices in the Register.

And whether users are hard copy or on-screen readers, they
routinely must slog through pages of often confusing
legalese.  To make things easier, the Federal Register
office regularly holds workshops on how to use the system.
The 1996 schedule includes workshops in and out of
Washington.

Other efforts to make life easier include a new column on
regulations taking effect that day a daily reminder of
impending closing dates for comments on proposed rules. --

AGRICULTURE SETS RULES FOR GRANT PROGRAMS

The Agriculture Department last month caught up on year-end
housekeeping, issuing final rules for its $100 million
National Competitive Research Grants program, which includes
health-related grants categories.

The rules add nothing new but finally codify for
grantseekers evolving administrative procedures that govern
grant competitions.  Affected programs include:

*  National Competitive Research Initiative Grants Program.
In a Dec. 8 Federal Register notice, USDA issued final rules
specifically defining the types of research funded under the
program and explaining award mechanisms.


The rules are effective immediately and should be consulted
for the fiscal 1996 competition, currently underway.

*  Higher Education Challenge Grants.  A Dec. 19 Federal
Register notice proposed rules for the program, which closed
its outlining matching grants requirements and underscoring
program focus on strengthening institutional capacities for
teaching food and agricultural sciences.

Grants -- $4 million in fiscal 1996 -- to four-year colleges
and universities fund projects to enhance curriculum,
faculty, scientific instrumentation, instruction and student
recruitment.  Proposed rules define eligibility, establish
the requirement for a match without setting the amount and
describe eligible activities.  Comments on proposed rules
are due Jan. 18.

*  1890 Capacity Building Grants.  A Dec. 20 Federal
Register notice proposed rules for soliciting, submitting
and evaluating applications for teaching project grants and
research grants to 16 historically black 1890 land-grant
institutions and Tuskegee University.  Comments on proposed
rules are due Jan. 19.
