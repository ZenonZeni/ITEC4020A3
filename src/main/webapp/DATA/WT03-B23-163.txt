<P>
In comparing the historical performance
of various financial assets, stocks are unmatched in their ability
to appreciate and stay ahead of inflation over time.
This ability makes them ideal investments for meeting long-term financial
goals.

<P>
<I><B>Historical Performance</B></I>

<P>
Although investing in stocks has no performance
guarantees, past history has shown that over time stocks have
produced better returns than other financial instruments. As the
following chart illustrates, $1.00 invested in stocks on December
31, 1925 significantly outpaced cash equivalents and bonds.<BR>

<P>
Decade in and decade out, stocks offer the
largest total returns of any asset class. Bonds may outshine stocks
one year, real estate the next, and even gold once in a while.
But over a 10-year span, stocks have consistently outperformed
them all.

<I><B>Stay Ahead of Inflation</B></I>

<P>
Even though the inflation rate fluctuates from
year-to-year, it still takes a bite out of your investments over
time. For example, suppose you were able to earn 10% annually
on your investment portfolio -- not inconceivable since it is
close to the compound annual return of 10.2% for large company
stocks from 1925-1994. Although we can agree that 10% is an achievable
return, remember that the 10% is <I>before </I>taxes
and <I>before</I> inflation.

<P>
If you are in the top tax brackets, you can
easily say good-bye to one-third of your return leaving you with
an after tax return of 6.6%. Now subtract inflation. If the economy
is growing slowly, inflation could be running a modest 3%, thus
leaving you with a total net return of 3.6%. If you think it only
looks bad in this example, consider this -- according to a study
done by Ibbotson Associates, a single person earning $75,000 in
1989 dollars who invested (excluding any state taxes) in 30-day
Treasury bills over the five-year period from 1990-1994 earned,
after taxes and inflation, a net return of -0.3%. Granted in some
years you can earn more than the average, such as last year's 30%-plus
gain, but there are also years where you may earn less or even
have a negative return. Clearly, it is important to consider inflation
and taxes when formulating any investment strategy.<BR>
