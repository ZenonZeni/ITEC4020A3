Dear Calanus colleagues,<p>

Inspired by the report from Mike Heath and KathyRichardson from the heavily rolling DANA (TASC
Newsletter No.2) here is a further report from thefront-line of Calanus research.  This comes from a
10oC constant temperature room at the University of Bergen field station at Espegrend, where we are
currently spending six hours each day, counting finmarchicus eggs.  Conditions are more stable than
they were on the DANA, but it is still a cold, damp way to spend the day.  Why are we doing it? We
are participating in a mesocosm experiment as part of a UK-funded project called PRIME (Plankton
Reactivity in the Marine Environment).<p> 

What is PRIME? The aim of PRIME is to lay the basis for mathematical models to describe the role
of plankton in determining those biogeochemical fluxes within the oceans which play an important
role in climate regulation.  Ultimately such models may allow accurate predictions to be made
concerning the impact of plankton on climate change, as it is increasingly recognised that the
activity of plankton may profoundly influence the levels of many chemical compounds in the ocean
and so affect gaseous air/sea exchanges. <p>

Within this broad framework, PRIME will obtain new insights into the structuring of plankton
communities and develop new approaches towards the modelling and observation of planktonic 
processes.  As such PRIME is planned to proceed by iterations between theory and observations, with
these observations being made in both semi-natural mesocosms and in natural oceanic communities.
PRIME has initially been funded for a period of 4 years by the Natural Environmental Research
Council and is bringing together laboratories and University groups from throughout the UK to focus
and co-ordinate their research efforts.<p>

PRIME is examining the nature and distribution of the major functional groups of marine plankton and
the regulation of these functional groups by physical, chemical and biological processes.  As
such, innovative methods of sampling form an integral part of the programme.  Techniques being
exploited include flow cytometry, acoustics, molecular probes and optical plankton counters. 
Such techniques will be combined with simultaneous automated collection of a variety of physico-
chemical parameters.<p>

In the initial phase of the project, during 1995, mesocosm experiments are being conducted in semi-
natural predefined conditions (our reason for coming to Norway).  By manipulating the physico- chemical
conditions in the water, a variety of planktonic communities and processes are being simulated. 
These experiments are serving as a testing ground for many of the new methodologies and approaches
and will also provide the initial data for the firstgeneration models to describe and predict plankton
dynamics.<p>

Following the foundations laid by this year's mesocosm experiments, field work will be
conducted in oceanic regions.  The first PRIME cruise is planned to take place in the North Atlantic
in the summer of 1996.  In situ observations will be combined with satellite imagery and historical data
sets.  This will allow the development of models to describe and predict the biological variability and
rate processes on a basin-wide scale.<p>  

Why has PRIME come to Norway? The University of Bergen has a very effective mesocosm facility at
Espegrend, which has previously been the focus of successful and productive experiments on the
dynamics of coccolithophores as part of the EU-funded MAST-II EHUX project.  Hence,
Espegrend was an obvious site for our 1995 experiment, and PRIME placed a subcontract with
the University of Bergen to run the experiment under the supervision of Jorun Egge from the
Department of Fisheries and Marine Biology.<p>

A short small-boat ride from the lab where we are working is the raft supporting the eight mesocosms
we are working with.  These are 2 m in diameter with a depth of 4.5 m, so their volume is about
11m3.  Replicate mesocosms have been fertilized with nutrient additions with differing N:P ratios, to
produce divergent phytoplankton assemblages. The experiment was started on 5 June and is expected to
end on 6 July.<p>
 
At present very different assemblages, dominated by diatoms and coccolithophores, have been achieved,
and are being sampled intensively for the range of PRIME projects represented by the team of 15
participating scientists.  These include: studies on the characterisation of marine viruses; biogenic gas
production in phytoplankton blooms; the development; parameterization and testing of a
generic, size-structured plankton model; pigment chemotaxonomy of phytoplankton biochemistry; the
use of modelling techniques to assess the nature of carbon acquisition by marine phytoplankton;
partitioning inorganic carbon assimilation and primary production in the euphotic zone; and lastly,
the reason why we are sitting in the cold room, our own project on polyunsaturated fatty acids and the
nutritional basis of trophic links in marine plankton.<p>

What are we doing? Our PRIME project is a collaborative one with John Sargent's group at the
Unit of Aquatic Biochemistry, University of Stirling, in Scotland.  It aims to determine levels and rates of
formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in marine phytoplankton in the laboratory, in mesocosms and
in the field and to model the results in terms of production, conversion and transmission of PUFA
by planktonic processes.  In particular we are interested in the relations between the composition
of the diet and zooplankton production. <p>
 
In the experiment we (myself, Dave Pond, Chris Harris and Kathryn Cook) are collecting particulate
material from each enclosure on a daily basis for PUFA analysis, measuring egg production by adult
female C. finmarchicus from each mesocosm, and collecting eggs for lipid analysis.  To obtain enough
material for analysis, the experimental protocol involves triplicate incubations of groups of 20
females for each mesocosm.  Egg production rates are high, and every egg has to be isolated with a
Pasteur pipette, which is why two of us are spending 6 hours at 10oC each day. <p>

With egg production rates in excess of 50 eggs/female/day a single replicate may yield more
than 1000 eggs for sorting (record to date 1359), a days work a harvest of more than 10,000 eggs
(record to date 13,770 in one day), and by the end of the experiment we should have over 70,000 hand
picked eggs in liquid nitrogen.  Is this a record? Once these have been shipped back on the ferry to
the UK, and subsequently analyzed at Stirling, we hope they will yield insights into the nutritional
links between the biochemical composition of the diet and reproduction.  We hope that this will lead
into studies proposed for TASC and doubtless many more C.fin eggs will be counted during the life of
the Trans-Atlantic Studies of Calanus finmarchicus. <p>

TASC will be funded by EU, and the budget is wasonly slightly reduced from that proposed.  We will
have 3 mECU with which to work.  We have just recently concluded negotiations around the
Technical Annex, and all of the proposed work plans are still intact.  We had to adjust some of the
activities according to the new budget situation, but the changes were mild.  The contracts will be signed
at the end of November, and the anticipated start will be in the first quarter of 1996. We are actually
beginning to advertise positions and preparing the ground for this big event! <p> 

I will have to give priority to establishing the communication lines by the beginning of January,
but we do not intend to wait until the money has arrived in the respective labs.  We are about to start
on the planning process, taking the most urgent first. I have emailed a mild signal to the partners,
encouraging them to start the next planning phase. The most important topic is the experimental task
(TASK 3) where we will have to conduct some important preliminary mesocosms tests in Bergen
the coming spring.  I therefore spent a lot of time last week working together with Francois Carlotti
during the EUROMARKET meeting in Sorrento and with Benni Hansen in Copenhagen in order to start
planning the experiments.  Benni will have a draft ready by the end of November on the mesocosm
experiments with Calanus.  There is a great need for starting to interact more specifically with you on the
other side of the Atlantic, and we will do  so after the turn of the year. <p>

I have also the news that the position for North Atlantic Programme Coordinator will be advertised
in Science in the very near future, and will be  open for a senior scientist in the field for 2 years. 
(Editor's note: ICES advertised this position for a "North Atlantic GLOBEC coordinator", with
applications closing on 31 Dec. 1995.)<p>

Last summer I posted an inquiry to the TASC email reflector, inquiring about the selection of mesh size
for study of Calanus.  The EU-TASC program proposal specified that 0.200 mm mesh would be used
for their oceanic sampling, while the U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank Program selected 0.150 mm mesh.  This
discrepancy may make some problems in intercomparison of data between programs.  From
responses to my inquiry, the reason for the difference appears to be different program interests. 
EU-TASC net sampling is strongly focussed on copepodite stages of Calanus, while Georges Bank
studies also target Pseudocalanus copepodites.<p>  

Before going further, let me take account of Ted Durbin's reply.  He insists, and is doing the work to
back it up, that population analysis that neglects nauplii is losing too much information, particularly
if the purpose of the study is to characterize the food available to larval fish.  For estimates of
naupliar abundance Ted is pumping water through an on-deck 0.050 mm filter.  This gives good retention
of even Pseudocalanus first Nauplii (N1).  It is fully adequate for Calanus eggs and nauplii.

A note from Mike Heath suggests that the 0.200 mm choice of EU-TASC is traditional: "I don't suppose
that any thought went into the choice of 0.200 mm for nets.  It's just common practice....For the ICOS
work we used 200 æm, but then we are working in the winter and only looking for Calanus.  The vast
majority are in stages 4 and 5 at that time of year, but we know from other studies that we happily
retain stages 1 and 2."  Wherever this tradition began, it was strengthened by the use of 0.200 mm
mesh in the design of the so-called Working Party No. 2 (WP-2) net for "smaller mesozooplankton"
(Tranter, 1968) approved for various surveys by ICES, SCOR and Unesco.<p>

Cabell Davis gives the rationale of the Georges Bank program for its 0.150 mm mesh choice for
copepod sampling by MOCNESS: With 0.200 mm mesh, "the very abundant Pseudocalanus spp. and
Paracalanus spp., which are often the dominant prey items of [larval] cod, haddock and herring are
greatly undersampled.... A 0.150 mm mesh was chosen ... because all copepodite stages of Pseudocalanus
spp. are caught quantitatively, allowing a demographic analysis that would otherwise not be
possible.<p>

The tradeoff in mesh selection is between catching relatively more small species and stages with finer
mesh and relatively less clogging by phytoplankton with coarser mesh.  The 1995 experience on
Georges Bank suggests (as did Mike Heath in his note) that the difference in this regard between 150
and 0.200 mm is slight.  If, for example, the premier clogging culprit Phaeocystis pouchetti is about, any
mesh will clog that will catch copepods at all.<p>

Careful study of the effects of mesh size goes back to Kofoid (1887, see Vannuci 1968), but critical
marine studies came later.  One of the more convincing is by Saville (1958), who had the bright
idea of towing the net of interest (60 silk threads/inch) inside a more retaining net (180/inch). 
He presented the comparison of the coarser (inside) and finer (outside) catches as selection curves:<p>

Vannuci (1968) cogently summarized Saville's results: "<i>... organisms are far more compressible
than was supposed earlier.  For example, the mean [50% loss] escapement of fish eggs of 1.403 mm
diameter is at a mesh width of 1.199 mm. However, Saville also showed that beads may also
pass through smaller meshes.  For instance, he found the 50 percent release point of glass balls of
diameter 0.261 mm to be at a mesh size of 0.222. Similar observations were recorded for fish larvae
and copepods. The curves obtained for glass beads are lower than for organisms.  This indicates that
the escape of organisms larger than the meshes is aided by the compressibility of the organisms and
the flexibility of the meshes, the latter accounting for the escape of glass beads.</i>"  So far as I know,
Saville's study has never been repeated for modern nylon nets.  While he tried a closely spaced range of
mesh sizes in the laboratory (fish eggs and glass) it has never been done for in the field with a range of
organisms. Too bad.<p>

A recent study by Nichols and Thompson (1991) compared 76 cm diameter nets of 0.061, 0.090, 0.124, 0.190
and 0.270 mm mesh towed side-by-side in the North Sea.  The study seems to confirm (figure below)
that 0.200 mm mesh should catch all copepodite stages of Calanus adequately, perhaps with some doubt left
by slightly lower mean numbers of C1 at 0.190 mm and definite loss of C1 at 0.270 mm.  Sampling of all
copepodites of Pseudocalanus minutus was adequate at 124 æm with complete loss of C1-C3 at 0.270 mm
and nearly complete loss of C1-C2 at 0.190 mm.<p>  

Another, less recent study by Colton et al. (1980) compared catch results of bongo nets equipped with
both 0.253 and 0.333 mm nets.  They also compared towing speeds of 1.5 and 3.5 knots.  They found
markedly greater catches of zooplankton smaller than herring larvae at 1.5 knots, attributing them to
reduced extrusion at lower speed.  This is definitely to be kept in mind.<p>

Lars Hernroth responded to the internet inquiry by sending a reprint of his 1987 paper comparing the
catches of Nansen nets to WP-2 nets for the special fauna of the central Baltic.  Since he did not
distinguish Calanus specifically, the results can't help us much.  However, the study shows that the
many older Baltic data from the Nansen net are underestimates, given the greater values produced by
WP-2 when towed with it.<p>

Studies of mesh retention capability are not likely to win any prizes, and they are time consuming
because of the number of samples that must be counted.  However, given the tremendous
investment going into Calanus (and Pseudocalanus) studies the next few years, it might pay for
somebody to repeat Saville's design with modern materials.  Note that this design requires less
counting than side-by-side tows, which suffer more from small-scale patchiness and subsampling
variability.  Somebody should do it, maybe I will.<p>  

Thanks to everyone who responded to the Internet inquiry. I was informed by what you said, even if
you weren't quoted directly.<p>

The U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank program is making definite progress with its principal goal. 
That is to discern the couplings of advection, mixing and thermohaline stratification (physics) with the
population biology of plankton.  The group is studying the larval ecology of Cod and Haddock
with particular attention to their interaction with populations of Calanus finmarchicus and
Pseudocalanus spp., principal foods for larval fish in the region.  This progress is under intense review
as the research group comes up to its 15 January deadline for renewal proposals.  This deadline is
preceded by sailing of our first 1996 cruise on January 9 (if we can get our government workers
off 'furlough'), so many of us have our proposals finished weeks ahead.  The next issue of TASC
Newsletter will include a brief review of the insights starting to flow from the Georges Bank study and a
listing of hopeful component proposals for work in 1996 and beyond.<p>

The ICES Working Group on Zooplankton Ecology, chaired by Hein Rune Skjoldal, has
declared 1997 The Year of Calanus.  That is to help scientists, agencies and intergovernmental
programs to keep all of our component studies operational and on tasc (sic) at making Calanus
finmarchicus the best understood animal in the world ocean.  To be effective The Year of Calanus
will need some publicity starting in early 1996. The next issue of TASC Newsletter will review the
requirements and possibilities.  Keep in mind, too, that a year will not be enough; they flash by.<p>
