This year also saw the retirement of Professor Peter L. Auer. Auer came
to Cornell in 1966 as a professor in the Graduate School of Aerospace Engineering.
Prior to that he had been deputy director of Ballistic Missile Defense,
a precursor of the recent &quot;Star Wars&quot; program, in the Defense
Department. At Cornell, Auer became the first director of the Laboratory
of Plasma Studies, co-directed the Cornell Energy Program and was, for a
period of time, Associate Director of the Sibley School.<BR>
