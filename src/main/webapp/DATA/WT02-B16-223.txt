<h2>Light and the Sun</h2>
<p><strong>The Sun and Earth</strong>
<p>The movement of light from one location to another can best be described as though it were a
wave, and different types of radiation are characterized by their individual wavelengths (a
wavelength is the distance from the peak of one wave to the peak of the next).  These
wavelengths indicate radiation with different amounts of energy; the longer the wavelength, the
less the energy.  Red light, then, has a longer wavelength and thus has less energy than violet
light.

<p>Each second, the sun releases an enormous amount of radiant energy into the solar system.  The
Earth receives a tiny fraction of this energy; still, an average of 1367 watts (W) reaches each
square meter (m<sup>2</sup>) of the outer edge of the Earth's atmosphere.  The atmosphere absorbs and
reflects some of this radiation, including most X-rays and ultraviolet rays.  Still, the amount of
sunshine energy that hits the surface of the Earth every minute is greater than the total amount of
energy that the world's human population consumes in a year!

<font color="#F79D00">The Earth's atmosphere and cloud cover absorb, reflect, and
scatter some of the solar radiation entering the atmosphere.  Nonetheless, enormous amounts of
direct and diffuse sunshine energy reach the Earth's surface and can therefore be used to produce
photovoltaic electricity.</font>
