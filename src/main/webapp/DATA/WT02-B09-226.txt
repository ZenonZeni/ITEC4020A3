				VADUZ, LIECHTENSTEIN&#0151;It was time to spot <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto’s</a> lucky lady on Saturday 21 September at 5.48pm (Central European time) as a female America Online subscriber walked off with a cool 1,903 Swiss francs.

					The <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>&#0145;Spot the Ball&#0146;</a> game has gained great popularity with lottery players ever since it was released two weeks ago. Over the past weekend, however, it has topped all expectations as players from around the world have flocked to get in on the action. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Before the weekend, the jackpot was well over 1,200 Swiss francs (more than US $1,000). On Saturday night, the jackpot was won during a game of &#0145;Spot the Ball Golf &#0146;. The prize was 1,906 Swiss Francs (US $1,530). That was when lotto fever became contagious, as players worked the jackpot back up to a staggering 1,650 Swiss Francs (over US $1340) at 12.30pm (CET) today. And the total’s getting higher all the time.

					There is a choice of three sports in the InterLotto skill game. When you play &#0145;Spot the Ball &#0146; you have a choice of Football, Baseball or Golf. The first golf puzzle has now been cracked. It will be interesting to see which sport is beaten next. The new golf puzzle looks simple, but you never know where the illusive ball is, until you start looking!

			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					So far, baseball has been the most popular of the sports available, with 42% of the playing action going to the US sporting choice. Next in popularity is soccer, which has had 37% of all plays. Golf is not far behind with 31% of game play.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
