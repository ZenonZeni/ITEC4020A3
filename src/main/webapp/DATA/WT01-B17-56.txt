<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>As we approach the twenty-first century, we should know 
more and become more 
aware that we live in a toxic soup.</CENTER></H3>
<HR>
        <H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>DETOXIFICATION:
A FIRST STEP</CENTER></H2>

<P>     Serafina Corsello, MD, Director of the Corsello Centers in New York City and
Huntington, NY, offers first-step advice on detoxification.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=75%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Toxicity is a word that has become part of household language.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=75%>

<P>     &quot;While Rome is on fire, most politicians play the lyre' - of medical control,
that is, ignoring issues we alternative physicians have been screaming about for
years.  Meanwhile, our toxic environment accelerates aging, causes permanent damage
and DNA mutations, and is responsible for disease states from allergy to cancer.


<P>     &quot;Toxicity is a word that has become part of household language-from NASA
scientists to school board members to the seventh-grader doing his homework
assignment.  Most people, however, don't really know what toxicity is all about and
how it can pervade every cell in their bodies.  More importantly, people don't know
they can do something very simple about the toxic soup we live in-to protect
themselves on a personal level.


<P>     &quot;A patient and her husband complained of constant fatigue, incessant headaches,
and general malaise.  At first, I was confused because this couple had been doing all
the &euml;right&iacute; things for 30 years-from abstaining from 'junk-food, cigarettes, and
alcohol to growing their own food, using organic farming techniques.  Their
afflictions just didn't seem to fit their lifestyle.  When I learned they lived near
a major highway, the reasons for and the solutions to their problems were obvious.


<P>     &quot;The cause: Fumes from the highway were a constant source of contamination for
their home-grown crops and, ultimately, their livers.  Toxic poisons displace
nutrients, contributing to weak and ineffective foods.  The soil itself can be
likened to a poorly fed mother delivering a twelfth child.  We now know that small
daily exposures have more devastating effects than exposure to sudden, one-time
blasts.


<P>     &quot;The resolution: A simple detoxification program, considering the fact that most
of the toxic substances go through your digestive tract.  You can block some of these
residues if you have bowel movements two or three times a day-as most vegetarians do
and as our evolutionary ancestors did.  Primates eliminate after every meal-an ideal
process for avoiding internal contamination.

<A NAME="VITC"> </A>
<P>     &quot;The first step in the detoxification program involves a morning 'cocktail'
consisting of fiber and vitamin C. Place a teaspoon or more of your favorite fiber
mix in a glass. (My favorite contains 80 percent organic flaxseed fiber and 20
percent pectin.) Add about I teaspoon (formulas vary) of vitamin C powder equivalent
to about two to three thousand milligrams in the ascorbate form (that's two to three
grams)-in two ounces of juice for taste. (The hardy can eliminate the Juice.) Add
eight ounces of pure water.  Drink before breakfast.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Toxic poisons displace nutrients, contributing to weak and ineffective foods.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=75%>

<P>     &quot;If your bowels are sluggish perhaps because of overweight-slowly increase the
quantity of ascorbate until you have a gushing, cleansing bowel movement that expels
the '&euml;crud&iacute; that has accumulated for years.  This is called adding vitamin C to bowel
tolerance.


<P>     &quot;Buy a good lactobacillus supplement, and take the amount indicated on the label
(no harm in even doubling that amount) every day.  The lactobacillus &euml;good guy&iacute;
bacteria have a natural antibiotic effect and help to begin the process of
detoxification.


<DL><DT><B>Caution:</B>  Abrupt consumption of fiber by a digestive system not accustomed to
                <DD>such bounty may cause adverse reactions at first.  If this happens, back off for a
        day or so, and then start again with diminished amounts, building to the recommended
                dosages gradually.
</DL>


<P>     &quot;If you have any chronic condition, proceed very slowly.  If you have intestinal
bleeding, active Crohn's disease, or any other serious stomach or digestive problems,
please refer to your physician.


<P>     &quot;Until you get your detoxification program in action, you may want to start by
drinking a large glass of warm water or herbal tea upon awakening.  This helps to
remove mucus and toxic residues that accumulate on the surface of your digestive
track, otherwise absorbed with your breakfast.


<P>     Keep in mind that your digestive system is a large ecological field.  The villi
(tiny hairlike structures that reach out to absorb nutrients) in your small
intestines can, if stretched, cover an entire football field.  Be good to them!&quot;

        <DT><B>Resources: </B> Vitamin C ascorbates and acidophilus can be purchased at any health store.  If your local store does not carry a satisfactory fiber mix, here are a few recommendations:
