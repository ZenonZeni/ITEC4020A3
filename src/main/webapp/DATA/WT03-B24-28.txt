Special Issue on
<I> Active Database Systems
</I></H3>

Active database systems integrate event-based rule processing with 
traditional database functionality.  Combining databases with active 
rules yields flexible and powerful systems that can exhibit a wide 
range of reactive behavior and that can perform inferencing over 
massive data. Over the past several years there has been a great surge 
of interest in active database systems, with numerous useful research 
results, prototypes, and commercial products.  In view of the rapidly 
growing importance of active database systems, a special issue of the 
Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, planned for fall 1996, 
will be devoted to topics in this area.  Papers are solicited in, but 
not limited to, the following topics:

 <UL>
<LI> 	Active database event and rule languages and processing,
<LI>		Active database system architecture and implementation issues,
<LI>		Performance evaluation of active database systems,
<LI>		Temporal and real-time aspects of active database systems,
<LI>		Theoretical foundations of active database systems,
<LI>		Active database design issues and application development,
<LI>		Deployment of active database technology on real applications, and
<LI>		Relationship between expert systems, knowledge-base systems,
    and active database systems

<H3>The Journal
</H3>
The mission of the <EM>JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS: 
Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Database Technologies</EM>  is to present research and development focused on the integration of 
Artificial Intelligence and Database Management technologies to 
provide models, architectures, tools, and techniques for the next 
generation of systems -- Intelligent Information Systems.  The journal 
focuses on the creation of information systems that exhibit 
intelligent behavior and embody intelligence in their reasoning and 
management processes.  The journal is an archival, peer-reviewed, 
technical journal publishing high-quality, state-of-the-art papers.
