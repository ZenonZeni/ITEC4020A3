1. Changchun</H3>

<BR>

On Friday September 13 a variety of international BRDF people met at the

Youyi Binguan (Friendship Hotel) in Beijing, registered and readied themselves

for a two-part meeting - the first International Workshop On Multiangular

Remote Sensing (Measurements, Models And Applications).<BR>

<BR>

The Meeting was organised by members of the Institute of Remote Sensing

Applications (IRSA) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and of the

Beijing Normal University. There was international help as well, especially

from Alan Strahler's group at Boston University. The first part of the Meeting

was held in Changchun, a city to the north of Beijing in Jilin. It is known

as the Detroit of China due to its vehicle production industry and historically

it is remembered as the Capital of Manchu Guo, the puppet state set up by

Japan in 1931 with the last emperor Pu Yi as head. But neither of these

brought us there. Near Changchun is the Jingyuetan Remote Sensing Test Site.<BR>

<BR>

Operated by the CAS, the Test Site has a wide range of land covers and has

been the site of many field experiments and validation campaigns. Since

1980, an extensive laboratory facility has been developed. In particular,

we came to see the indoor Solar Simulation Laboratory. This is a large scale

goniometer with an artificial source to simulate the sun and moveable positions

for sun/sensor effects measurement. The target measured is a square metre

of anything you can fit in a square meter. A small table top instrument

has also been developed to allow multi-angular measurements of reflectance

and transmittance at the scale of leaves.<BR>

<BR>

We saw the site in operation and the data processed in quick time as 3D

plots. There was considerable discussion of the various edge effects and

conditions that make this type of facility similar or different to <I>in

situ</I> measurements. We were all impressed by the facility. I wish we

had one even if only to calibrate our field panels! But not all is lost,

since we are welcome to define and conduct experiments at Jingyuetan. Indeed,

if field campaigns were made at the general site, example patches could

be tested for complete BRDF at the same time. It beats using a Spectron

SE590 out in the weather while the sun and sky change around you. Meanwhile,

a graduate student can be measuring the leaves as well!<BR>

<BR>

Nearby is a solar observatory on a hill top with a dome roof that opens

allowing a range of continuous sun photometer and irradiance device data

to be collected. Quite an investment has been made and in principle a high

level of characterisation could be had at Jingyuetan - to a level we have

no hope of matching in Australia at this time.<BR>

<BR>

After a good lunch on Sunday September 15 (which by itself was probably

enough to justify further collaboration and cooperative development) we

flew back to (warmer) Beijing for the next phase of the Workshop.<BR>

<H3>2. Beijing</H3>

<BR>

On the morning of Monday September 16 the talking and discussion part of

the Workshop began. We were welcomed by a group of very senior and distinguished

people from the CAS and the State Science and Technology Commission. Juhan

Ross, the 'grand old man' of radiation in plant canopies and Alan Strahler

(who is still quite young) gave Keynote Addresses which set the scene for

the Meeting.<BR>

<BR>

There followed two days (two half days and one full day) of very intensively

packed presentations. The program as presented, with speaker (bolded) and

topic is attached for you to read. The papers will be available in the near

future for you to look more carefully at talks that are especially relevant

to you. In this Report, I will limit my discussion to general impressions

plus a detailed set of notes on the outcomes Discussion that occurred on

Wednesday September 18<BR>

<BR>

Of course, a primary outcome for such meetings is for people working in

a field to meet, get to know each other if that has not happened before,

exchange ideas both during sessions and at any other time that is available

and jointly develop their ideas of the directions that need to be pursued

into the future. All of these happened.<BR>

<H3>3. General Notes &amp; Impressions</H3>

<H4>3.1 Parametric BRDF</H4>

<BR>

It was very comforting to see how the recent simplifications to BRDF models

(the 'kernel' and similar simple models) were performing well as tools in

atmospheric correction and image brightness correction at airborne, TM and

AVHRR data scales. Simplified models and linearity are obviously fashionable

but also provide very practical tools to describe and use BRDF for applications

such as those above and others such as panel characterisation. Obviously,

the scope for such techniques is about to increase with the launch of ADEOS

carrying POLDER and will further increase as MODIS and MISR data start to

come on line in a more distant time frame.<BR>

<BR>

These developments were outlined in Talks [1-8], [2-5], [3-3], [3-5], [3-6]

and [4-2]<BR>

<H4>3.2 Hospot Specific Instrumentation</H4>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl [1-2] provided advance notice for an innovative mission to utilise

the hotspot region from space using an active laser and tethered receivers.

It is 'Bi-static Lidar' I guess and the technology is feasible. All that

is needed is for the extra value of the information to be proven over not

doing it! His ideas are not alone in that.<BR>

<H4>3.3 Field and Laboratory Instrumentation</H4>

<BR>

There was a strong emphasis on field and laboratory measurement. In summarising

his session, Juhan Ross said that the main advances have been in computer

technology and in constructing measurement instruments. Instrumentation

and measurement protocols are very difficult but essential components of

the research and also of the applications. The ideas included field data

for structural characterisation as well as radiometric measurements. In

addition to the Changchun site, there is a goniometer in Italy at the European

Goniometric Observatory (EGO) which is also producing many detailed studies

of BRDF at the one square metre plot scale. It was clear, however, that

the leaf measurements being taken at Changchun were the envy of most and

we all hope to see outcomes being published and information made available

in the future.<BR>

<BR>

There is still a lot to be done relative to the 'scattering phase functions'

of the objects that different user models and radiative models want and

can deal with. Leaf measurements need to be linked to high spectral resolution

data and plant physiological information (such as chlorophyll and pigments)

as well. However, the tools are emerging to do this which did not previously

exist. At the 'module' or 'branch' scale, Juhan Ross described an instrument

for measuring scattering that is being used in Estonia (the 'Shoot Goniometer')

and for short crops and other covers, the large indoor Goniometers at Changchun

and ISPRA are obviously filling a need.<BR>

<BR>

However, in order to relate models, measurements and the objectives of the

users there is still some work to be done in describing and recording structure

in the non-homogeneous canopies we mostly work with. Juhan Ross and Tiit

Nilson were especially adamant of the need to introduce such protocols of

field description and measurement and emphasised that they need to relate

to the end use. Given the limited relationships between (say) traditional

forestry data and radiation data this may mean the definition of a set of

new phytometrical measurements. The Chinese work by Xiang Yueqin and Wang

Jindi ([1-11], [1-12]) is very interesting in this regard.<BR>

<BR>

Other talks covering this area were: [1-1], [1-4], [1-5], [1-9], [1-10],

[2-9] and [3-1]<BR>

<H4>3.4 Modelling &amp; Inversion</H4>

<BR>

The recent main advances in modelling seem to have been computational rather

than by changes in the physics and/or mathematics. There are now a well

defined set of models that can adequately describe the BRDF of structured

land covers. What is not so common are the parameters of the component properties

of the models (such as leaf phase functions!) and there is still scope for

computational simplifications and more robust techniques for inversion.<BR>

<BR>

Andres Kuusk and others described a number of uses of parameter inversion

with Landsat TM and AVHRR data. With Landsat TM data, Kuusk was inverting

chlorophyll content using relationships obtained from field and laboratory

measurements. Inversion is obviously the aim of this work and has still

to be made simpler and more robust.<BR>

<BR>

As a complete test base for models and measurements associated with the

EGO, Michel Verstraete described the Monte-Carlo RayTran model which has

been running on a supercomputer at ISPRA. Able to be linked to an L-System

model of the land surface it provides a good base for model testing and

data interpretation. He also described work in which the leaf structure

is modelled by simple geometric forms (cylinders, spheres and sheets). He

was keen to form an 'Observation Protocol' for the data that will be generated

in the future.<BR>

<BR>

Such work obviously sits at the interface between measurement and modelling.

At this advancing stage of the development of the BRDF research the two

are clearly dependent and complementary.<BR>

<BR>

Related Talks were: [2-1], [2-2], [2-3], [2-6], [2-7], [2-8], [3-1], [3-2],

[3-3], [3-4], [3-5], [3-6], [3-8], [3-9] and [4-1].<BR>

<H4>3.5 Remotely Sensed Data</H4>

<BR>

There were many data types discussed. These ranged from the use of existing

data types, such as aerial photography, Landsat TM, AVHRR and airborne data

(such as Daedalus data) to simulations of the emerging data types such as

POLDER, MISR and MODIS.<BR>

<BR>

Quite a variety of airborne instruments exist now which can obviously be

used for research as well as for their prime objective as development tools

for space borne instruments. These include ASAS, the POLDER simulator and

MISR Airborne Simulator (MAS). These can be regarded separately as tools

for mapping just as the final spaceborne tools will be. Their advantages

are those of airborne data - flexible deployment, control over calibration

and ancillary data.<BR>

<BR>

Papers discussion these include: [1-6], [1-7], [1-8], [3-2], [3-3], [3-4],

[3-5], [3-8] and [3-9].<BR>

<H4>3.6 Scale</H4>

<BR>

There were many ranges of scale presented at the workshop. Information was

obtained and models discussed for the sub-millimetre scale of ice crystals,

through soil grain, leaf, branch, crown and canopy up to AVHRR scale. It

seemed to be unquestioned that BRDF and Hotspot effects translated easily

through these scale changes.<BR>

<BR>

I believe the area of BRDF and Hotspot effects is perhaps almost unique

in the way its significant invariants do transfer across scales. Yet it

is not all so easy. There are many issues of scale that are as yet neglected.

Relationships between phase functions for the 'grains' listed above and

those of the components making them up have no complete theory and this

is a major challenge. Not wanting to push a barrow necessarily, I would

mention that this scaling undoubtedly involves at least spatial variance

and correlations and that the 'mean' effects we call BRDF and the Hotspot

are not themselves sufficient to describe the scaling.<BR>

<BR>

There were papers involving many scales but none on 'scale'. There was one

which discussed variance [2-4].<BR>

<H4>3.7 The Hunter and the Dog</H4>

<BR>

Juhan Ross pointed out that in Estonia in the forestry and ecology 'hunts'

it has been traditional to regard the Forester or Ecologist as the Hunter

and the physicist as the Dog. However, he noted that the traditional forestry

and ecology cannot handle the information our science is able to provide

nor cope with the scales we can encompass. He claimed that in radiation

ecology it is time for the physicist to become the Hunter and the Dog.<BR>

<BR>

I agree. In other cases we have for years been asked by climate modellers

and others to provide crude summarising parameters for models whose handling

of the radiation fields would make any remote sensing specialist weep. Our

science is moving into data spaces unknown to our 'Hunter' buddies. It is

time to hunt down what <I>we</I> can find out about the world that no one

else can reach and then also drop it on their clean boots with wagging tails!<BR>

<H3>4. The Closing Discussion of September 18</H3>

<BR>

The following discussion is an expansion of the set of notes provided and

taken by Alan Strahler as Chair and facilitator of this important discussion.

He is thanked for the privilege he gave me to use his notes but is not to

blame for the [embellishments].

<H4><BR>

4.1 Initial Discussion Starter.<BR>

</H4>

<B>4.1.1 Why Study BRDF in Remote Sensing?</B><BR>

<BR>

(i) Improve understanding of physical scattering mechanisms of surface covers

and interaction with soil and atmosphere;<BR>

<BR>

(ii) Retrieval of surface parameters by inversion. But which parameters?

See below ...<BR>

<BR>

[Maybe not just inversion but also by interpretation and pattern recognition]<BR>

<BR>

(iii) Correction of angular effects in imagery allowing users to make their

own inferences.<BR>

<BR>

[Users often want to apply image processing to mosaics. Image processing

implies spatial stationarity which angular variations disrupt. We need the

make the data at least 'quasi-stationary]<BR>

<BR>

Key Problem: &quot; ... the main limiting factor remains - obtained by remote

sensing, vegetation parameters quite poorly express the main biological

processes - photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, allocation etc of

growing vegetation.&quot; (Juhan Ross)<BR>

<BR>

That is, Radiation Parameters are not the same as Ecological Parameters.<BR>

<BR>

[However, Ross has the view that the fault is not with RS but there needs

to be a re-appraisal of measurement models on both the ecological and remote

sensing sides. That is, it is time the Dog became the Hunter and the Dog.

This is not just the case in vegetation cover. Linking the user scene measurement/descriptive

model with the radiative scene measurement/descriptive model is the Key

issue in most applications.]<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.1.2 What is Needed?</B><BR>

<BR>

Models:	Not a problem<BR>

		Inversion strategies can use improvement<BR>

<BR>

[There was not complete agreement here. Bernard Pinty, the Modeller's Modeller

(i.e. a Modeller who is such a Modeller that even Modellers call him a Modeller),

felt that better models are still needed. Personally, I think the current

models are advanced enough and are not what is pushing the boundary. It

is a common statement in water radiation models and atmosphere radiation

models that the current limitations are not in the models but in our knowledge

of the physical parameters and properties that are needed to run the models.

Land models are not as well established but the statement is, I think, the

same. Better <I>Inversion</I> theory, of course, can provide many of these

properties in addition to the scene parameters.]<BR>

<BR>

Data:		&quot;Point&quot; measurements for model development and validation<BR>

			Lab:	Leaf scattering measurements<BR>

				Goniometric measurements of targets<BR>

			Field:	Goniometric measurements of real targets in the <BR>

				atmosphere<BR>

		&quot;Area&quot; measurements to extend information spatially<BR>

			Field campaigns, aircraft data<BR>

			Satellite data - AVHRR, POLDER, MODIS, MISR &amp;<BR>

			Spot-Vegetation<BR>

<BR>

[Measurement and Validation issues are a major issue and provide the current

challenge. At all stages and scales it is also important to introduce the

correct environmental information so that the radiation scene models and

the user scene models can be related. For example, are leaf measurements

useful without pigment and high spectral data measurements? Can fluorescence

data provide the link? In each case above there is an issue of standardisation

and information cataloguing. What is the minimal data set and descriptors

such that the data can be used by others? What standardisation is needed

in measurement techniques as well as information recording? Is a field reflectance

useful if (at least) the fraction of diffuse radiation is not recorded?

Is a leaf scattering reading useful if leaf absorption spectrum and/or fluorescence

spectrum is/are not recorded?]<BR>

<BR>

Mechanisms		

<BLOCKQUOTE>Sharing models?<BR>

Sharing Data?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

[The above applies. There need to be common bases for model and data comparison

and validation. Perhaps there are standard targets which can be used to

test instruments and standard scenes to test models. But how do you adequately

define and parametrise these? The suggestion is recorded later for some

form of email discussion area. Maybe a listserver is a good start. However,

perhaps a full Web Site is what is needed with pointers to data owners and

sites, model owners and sites plus a compendium of proposed standards and

methods for model and field analysis. The EOC is starting such a beast.

For people who are not on the internet, an HTML version could be supplied

regularly by diskette for off-line browsing!]<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.1.3 What's Next for This Workshop?</B><BR>

<BR>

Biennial Meetings?<BR>

		1998 in ISPRA or Toulouse<BR>

<BR>

[I suggest also that the regular slot at IGARSS be maintained as a continuity

placer meeting. This plus the 'Web' site may be enough to keep the Beijing

momentum going forward.]

<H4><BR>

4.2 General Discussion</H4>

<BR>

The general discussion that followed was recorded in point form by Alan

Strahler. I have repeated the points with some expansion but usually without

[embellishment] as I remember them from the time. Where a change may change

the meaning I have recorded it in [brackets]. In addition, I have re-ordered

the points and collected them under a number of headings reflecting my viewpoint

and interests.<BR>

<BR>

[The classification arises from my way of describing what most of the modellers

and measurers are going through. That is, they decide on a 'grain' for their

objects, define a set of properties or functions attributable to the grains

and arrangement and geometric properties attributable to the collection

of grains. The complete system is the scene model. This &quot;grain&quot;

model must be relatable to both the radiation model and the user model of

the world if the activity is to be completely successful. When they go out

to measure the world, the relationship between the measurements and this

scene model is the measurement model. If the data are to be useful there

must be a good base measurement model.<BR>

<BR>

For example, in plant canopies, you must decide if you are working at the

leaf and stem level, the 'shoot' or 'module' level, or whether you can start

at the crown level, or stand level or community level. Foresters tend to

think of forests as collections of tree trunks with aggregate basal areas

and stem size distributions and make appropriately scaled measurements,

but ecologists have a bit more flexibility. Crop modelling is usually best

done at the leaf and stem level although recent data suggest the architecture

of the way these group on plants is also of significance for modelling.<BR>

<BR>

In each case, if you are an ecologist, for example, you must ensure the

description is rich enough in scene model grain and measurement model scale

to accommodate the outputs of interest such as CO2 flux, water flux or energy

balance components. It must be powerful enough to accommodate dynamics (such

as succession) if this is the objective. For the remote sensor, it must

be equally flexible and sufficient if these outputs are the objectives but

it must particularly be sufficient to describe the radiation <I>measurement</I>

model and link to the sensor <I>measurement</I> model.<BR>

<BR>

The relationship between the user scene model and the radiation scene model

involves measurement scale. The measurement scale may be finer or coarser

than the user scene model and this relationship is important for choice

of analytical approach. In the Strahler et al. terminology, the radiation

measurement model may be (Low) L- or (High) H-resolution relative to the

scene model.<BR>

<BR>

Using these ideas, the points people have made are collected under four

headings:<BR>

<BR>

1. Relationships Between User and Radiation Models<BR>

<BR>

2. Tools for Measurement of Properties &amp; Structure<BR>

<BR>

3. Radiation Measurement Models &amp; Inversion<BR>

<BR>

4. Infrastructure Issues<BR>

<BR>

The collection 1. is of special significance and is the longest. It includes

how to describe the scene as well as the issues of Standards, User Viewpoints

and User Attitudes. Typical management views in some of the programs may

reflect user views and question whether BRDF based methods really work,

whether there are too many models and too few products and complain that

there are too few standards and less quality control. What are the products?<BR>

<BR>

Bernard Pinty made the suggestion that it is too early for standards. I

fear that if it is too early then it is already too late.<BR>

<BR>

As a final category I have listed Infrastructure Issues. These are things

we can do as a &quot;BRDF Community&quot; to take things forward.]<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.1 Relationships Between User and Radiation Models</B><BR>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl: Parameter match must be made. Ecologists see the [same] &quot;sun&quot;

for their applications. We need to locate the same phenomena that give the

biological effect and the radiation effect. Canopy architecture is an overlap

area. We need structure-based vegetation classifications.<BR>

<BR>

Andres Kuusk: Chemical composition of leaves from spectral measurements

is [an] overlap area.<BR>

<BR>

[An optical classification exists based on pigments. Is it as discriminating

as the optical classification for algae in water quality modelling and measurement?]<BR>

<BR>

Tiit Nilson: The ground [model] has plant communities involving spatial

distributions and patterns which depend on scale. At small scales they may

be regular and at large scales clumped. Also, the mutual influences of plants

are important but rarely used in models. [Tiit suggested that these relationships

would help the over-parameterised models.]<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: In ecology there are a range of models for succession called 'Gap

Models' which are based on an effectively continuous canopy with 'holes'.

These should be able to be modelled and used to interpret broad scale images.

The individual trees are not actually considered.<BR>

<BR>

Xiang Yueqin: It is important to develop descriptions of structure of the

different types of crop such as wheat and corn. We need to work out how

to scale structure. There is a problem in measurement at points due to different

types, times of planting etc. Need to characterise the variance for agricultural

applications.<BR>

<BR>

Bernard Pinty: Connecting radiation with ecology. For example, with LAI

it has been mostly done from spectral data. There is [apparently] no need

for angular data. But what is the error in LAI? We can get LAI by inversion

[of BRDF] but in the end this will only reduce error which may not be very

interesting to the end users. We need to develop more [unique outputs].

Eg LAI+Structure+... For combined wavelength we have the same [structural]

parameters, the same state variables so there is a lot more information

but a more difficult inference.<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: Sophisticated scene and measurement models for remote sensing have

often had to deliver simple products for less sophisticated biophysical

models - eg SEB. But this is changing. The demands from modellers are becoming

more sophisticated and spatial variation in CO2, water and energy fluxes

are being tackled by modellers. Demands for better products will come. We

must anticipate these requests for structural data and have the answers

ready.<BR>

<BR>

Wolfgang Wanner: About the &quot;gap&quot;. Remote sensing provides a huge

knowledge [base] about the Earth's vegetation and spatial structure. So

maybe RS can help extend ecologists thinking to scales they cannot reach

with plot data. For example, a new LC classification based on BRDF and the

way large areas green up etc.<BR>

<BR>

Phillip Lewis: Remotely sensed information may often be at the wrong scale.

Ecologists often need fine scale information.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Scale is a problem. Now ecologists are interested in detailed

information such as process studies, stomatal closure for CO2 etc.<BR>

<BR>

[Why is everyone forgetting airborne data? Multi-spectral, multi-angle data

with pixels &lt; 1 metre is no problem!]<BR>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl: Why do we limit ourselves? We should be extending the ecologists

point of view. This is the &quot;Pretty Picture&quot; syndrome. We should

now be extending the view using polarisation and detecting stress at a global

scale. First signs of stress are not spectral but wilting - structural changes.<BR>

<BR>

Alfred Chang: Microwave may be more sensitive to such stress. Physics unites

all our science. The same equations but different approximations. We need

to study detection efficiency.<BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Ecologists cannot help us. We need to educate ourselves as to

what is needed and how to get it. [We must be both Hunter and Dog].<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Do we need any more models?<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: Maybe we have enough models and what we really need are some standards?<BR>

<BR>

Sig Gerstl: We need a 'super-model' of the standard models structured by

application.<BR>

<BR>

Bernard Pinty: Maybe we need more data. It is too early for standards.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: We are not focussed clearly on a product. LAI at a global scale

has a focus which BRDF does not have yet. Even then different models are

needed for different areas.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.2 Tools for Measurement of Properties &amp; Structure</B><BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Need to make use of the forward scattered light to increase

spectral information.<BR>

<BR>

[Maybe it is almost mandatory to measure reflectance and transmittance of

translucent materials. It is certainly the case that only measuring leaf

reflectance of Australian trees misses more than half the information]<BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Need to add other regions of the spectrum - microwave, thermal

etc. In microwave the is information about [the same] leaves, stems etc.

and no cloud problem. We need medium sized goniometric apparatus for Shoot

measurements and bridge the gap between leaf and canopy. This could use

a laser beam. Maybe this would cost about $300K.<BR>

<BR>

Prof. Kawata: Polarised light is important now that scanning polarised sensors

are becoming available. Need ground and vegetation measurements to support

POLDER.<BR>

<BR>

Shunlin Liang: Canopy polarisation is 2-3% but soils polarise to 10-15%

so may be more important than vegetation as an opportunity for POLDER.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.3 Radiation Measurement Models &amp; Inversion</B><BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: For architecture, the use of fractals and L-Systems should be

increased.<BR>

<BR>

Shunlin Liang: Can BRDF help in remote sensing of water and soils?<BR>

<BR>

DLBJ: In remote sensing of water the angular distribution of the emerging

radiation field is highly indicative of water properties - especially in

more turbid waters. Clumps of algae or other particles have a strong effect

known as the 'Packet' effect in water literature.<BR>

<BR>

Xu Xiru: Need to use thermal infrared data. The question is how to use it?

Need Effective Emissivity (thermal BRDF) models [the models need to be effective

as well!]. This is significant in CO2 flux.<BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Need to connect TIR data to the heat balance and surface energy

balance.<BR>

<BR>

<B>4.2.5 Infrastructure Issues</B><BR>

<BR>

Juhan Ross: Next meeting we should invite microwave specialist[s].<BR>

<BR>

Alan Strahler: Lets invite water people to the next meeting.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: Being pragmatic - lets get people from the ecological community

here to talk about structure - perhaps a &quot;Tutorial&quot;.<BR>

<BR>

Don Deering: There is an email based &quot;Plant Canopy Network&quot;. Do

we want to develop an internet network? May need special funding for someone

to manage it. Can start with a User Group on the internet.<BR>

<BR>

[The issues raised are clearly ones we must cooperate to resolve. We all

need to consider the end users and 'markets' as a common area to develop

and we must all display the quality we know our work can provide. When the

demand is there we can all compete as to who can meet it best or most efficiently

or for the lowest cost - but until it exists our competition is probably

destructive. The development of a network for the BRDF community is a very

important step and regular meetings are an equally important step. A lot

of ground was covered in this Meeting and quite a lot was turned over as

well. I look forward to the next.]<BR>
