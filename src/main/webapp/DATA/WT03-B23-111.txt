<P>
It is a tragedy for all Victorians that the current push by the
Kennett Government, the Victoria Police, and the Police Association
for increased police powers has failed to consider issues of police
accountability and responsibility.
<P>
Our world is full of examples of the disastrous effects of the
excesses of governments and their enforcement agencies on individual
citizens, classes of citizens and whole societies.  Yet we are
being asked to blindly accept, by those bodies who have the greatest
to gain from the increased powers proposed, that what they propose
for their own interests is for our benefit.
<P>
The fact that our society is based upon a political system with
the fundamental precept that government is to be accountable to
the community, and not that the community must account to its
political representatives and their appointees, seems to have
been forgotten.
<P>
It is equally true that individuals in our society must be held
accountable for their actions, although it would seem that the
most powerful in our community are able to avoid the accountability
required of the less powerful. This reality does not seem to have
troubled the minds of those hell bent on achieving their political
agenda of increased police powers.
<P>
Where individuals are required to account to the rest of the community
for their actions through the governments' investigative and enforcement
agencies, special care needs to be taken to balance the fundamental
rights of the individual against their duty to be accountable
for their alleged actions.
<P>
To help achieve this balance of fundamental rights and accountability,
our society have given special privileges and powers to police
and other enforcement agencies. All of us are entitled, and in
fact duty bound to all other citizens, to demand proper accountability
for the exercise of the these special privileges and powers by
the government and the police.
<P>
Police officers openly lobbying for increased powers is dangerous
and obnoxious to the concept of accountability. Those who are
to benefit from the granting of the extra-ordinary powers being
proposed are abusing their position of trust and privilege by
openly engaging in an exercise of political pressure and media
grand standing. The police, as public servants, should make their
submissions to their Minister in the appropriate manner.
<P>
What new privileges and powers are being proposed for this special
group? Does the Kennett Government propose to engage the community
in debate about the privileges and powers they intend to give
away on our behalf?
<P>
What standards of accountability are to be demanded of those who
are given these privileges and powers? What can the community
expect when these privileges and powers are abused? What steps
are being taken to minimise the risk of the abuse of privilege
and power granted? What steps are being taken to prevent the ever
too familiar cover up of these abuses when they happen?
<P>
These questions demand answers but few are being provided.
<P>
It is understood that privileges and powers in relation to providing
name and address, strip searches and finger prints and other body
samples are among those sort and likely to be granted. How well
they reflect the balance required between fundamental rights and
accountability, and how those who will be granted them are to
be accountable is apparently too frightening to debate.
<P>
The notion that police will have the power, enforceable by the
criminal law, to demand a name and address of any one on the street,
is both frightening and bizarre. This truly is an example of the
citizen being made arbitrarily accountable to the government.
Such a power is the essence of a repressive, dictatorial society.
<P>
Within the framework of privileges and powers granted by the rest
of the community to the police, the appropriate law is one which
requires the police to provide details of their rank, name, station
and reason for intervening in the citizens life. Such a law must
be accompanied by an appropriate criminal penalty for failure
to comply with the citizens request, with the onus of proof resting
on the person entrusted with the privilege and the power.
<P>
Any notion that police should have the power to demand name and
address in the manner envisaged is a nonsense. Any person arrested
and charged with a crime cannot be released under current laws
without providing, and if requested, verifying name and address.
Where there is insufficient &quot;reasonable belief&quot; to justify
the arrest of a citizen then there is absolutely no grounds for
a power to demand name and address.
<P>
The Australia Card was stridently opposed by the community, why
should we now surrender such power to the police? Greater protection,
perhaps by way of a Bill of Rights, must be afforded to our democratic
and human rights.
<P>
Under existing Victorian law, police are entitled to request finger
prints of persons suspected of committing a crime. This is done
as a matter of routine. Where the citizen refuses to provide consent
to the taking of finger prints then police must account to an
independent authority, in the form of a Magistrate, before they
can use force to take the finger prints.        
<P>
If after considering the material put by police and the guidelines
provided in the Crimes Act, the Magistrate believes that it is
appropriate for the finger prints to be taken, then the police
may use force to obtain them.
<P>
Under this system of accountability police have been able to obtain
around 30,000 finger prints per year.
<P>
This approach provides an appropriate balance between the accountability
and rights of the citizen, and the accountability of the person
our society has seen fit to grant special privileges and powers.
<P>
The taking of other body samples, with the exception of breath
analysis for the purpose of drink driving laws, are also currently
subject to similar accountability provisions. Again, a sensible
and workable balance has been achieved in the interest of the
whole community, not just in the interest of those entrusted with
the special privileges and powers.
<P>
Ordinary searches, strip searches and internal body searches are
not currently covered by laws which provide for proper external,
independent accountability in Victoria. The failure of the previous
Labour Government to address this area of accountability must
forever remain to their discredit.
<P>
It is to be hoped that the current Liberal Government will ensure
that the most basic of human rights, the sanctity of ones own
body, will be finally protected from the arbitrary, and therefore
obscene, abuse by police. No strip search or internal body search
should be allowed in Victoria without the prior external and independent
accountability of the police to a Magistrate, whose decision is
subject to judicial review.
<P>
If our community requires anything less than that level of protection
and accountability then we are not serious about the protection
of community members.
<P>
One of the most frightening privileges we have given to our police
is that of carrying arms. Police in Victoria carry firearms as
a matter of course. This fact, coupled with the reality of internal
review of their use and misuse, and the refusal of police officers
to answer questions at Coroners' inquests into citizens deaths
at the end of a police gun, on the grounds that they might incriminate
themselves, strongly suggests that the accountability/privilege
equation is badly out of balance.
<P>
As a community we must either demand that police hand back  their
guns and provide prior accountability for any requests for their
issue, or insist on proper independent, external accountability
for their use. The current system amounts to the absolute worst
form of accountability and its continuation is an unacceptable
blight on our community.
<P>
Allegations of excessive and deliberate use of violence by Victoria's
police in police stations has been chronic for years. Nothing
has been done to effectively tackle this problem. Police privately
admit that the problem exists and that there is an unwritten code
that police will turn a blind eye and actively protect police
who engage in this violence.
<P>
The establishment of an independent, trained community visitors
scheme, with powers to enter Victorian police stations unannounced,
would go a long way towards achieving an appropriate balance between
privilege and accountability. Naturally sensible guidelines would
need to be established to ensure that police work was not unnecessarily
interfered with, and to protect the rights of those in police
custody, including their right to confidentiality.
<P>
Such a scheme would also serve to protect police from false accusation
and provide support for them in relation to their working conditions.
<P>
Independent assessment and evaluation of recruitment and selection
criteria for Victoria's police is fundamental to the issue of
balancing privileges, powers and accountability. Likewise the
training of police should be subject to independent assessment
and evaluation.
<P>
These and other issues, such as the external investigation of
complaints against police, must be addressed before our community
should consider granting further privileges and powers to our
police. It is they who serve the community, not the community
who serve them.
