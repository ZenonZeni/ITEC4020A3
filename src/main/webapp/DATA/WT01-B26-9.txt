        <td width="477">Opiates see widespread use as a pain
        killer for injured soldiers during the Civil War. Opiates
        were the first real miracle drugs because they allowed
        the patient to be anesthetized while the doctor performed
        surgery. Before the advent of opiates, the most common
        surgery was a simple amputation. That is, the doctor got
        several big strong people to hold the patient down and
        then literally sawed off an arm or a leg while the
        patient screamed in pain. For this reason, a good doctor
        was a fast doctor. Battlefield hospitals during the Civil
        War commonly had large piles of severed arms and legs.
        The use of opiates as anesthesia gave doctors time to
        work on the patient and actually made modern surgery
        possible. </td>

        our millions of voluntary slaves still clang their
        chains. The lot of the literal slave, of him whom others
        have enslaved, is indeed a hard one; nevertheless, it is
        a paradise compared with the lot of him who has enslaved
        himself to alcohol.&quot; [Quoted in Sinclar, op. cit.

        passed in San Francisco and Virginia City. Opium itself
        was not outlawed and remained available in any number of
        over-the-counter products. Only the smoking of opium was
        outlawed, because that was a peculiarly Chinese habit and
        the laws were specifically directed at the Chinese. The
        white people in the communities feared that Chinese men
        were luring white women to have sex in opium dens. <hr>
        <p>The patent medicine industry started its rise. Because
        there were no restrictions on advertising, labeling, or
        contents of any products the patent medicine industry
        made up all sorts of concoctions including the opiates,
        cocaine, and other drugs, and sold them with the most
        extravagant advertising claims. This led to a rise in
        addiction.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Addiction was poorly understood. Morphine and heroin
        were recommended as remedies for alcohol addiction.</p>

        <p><b>French Wine of Coca: Invigorating Tonic</b> became
        a popular soft drink because it contained cocaine. It

        similar drinks like Pepsi-Cola, made the soda fountain a
        common part of the neighborhood pharmacy. </p>
