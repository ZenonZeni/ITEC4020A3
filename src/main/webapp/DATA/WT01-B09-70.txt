<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  31­foot Purpose Built Bus and Rapid Charger<p>
Performing Organization:  Delco Remy/Allison. Georgia Power; Electric Transit Vehicle Institute; Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority</B><p>

<P>POC: John Powell, Telephone (615) 622-3884</P>

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>A 31­ft transit quality electric bus will be developed with a new generation AC drive system; sealed,
maintenance­free lead acid batteries; and rapid recharge. It will be demonstrated at Chattanooga's
"Living Laboratory" and in Atlanta (Georgia Power/MARTA). Tests will be conducted after break­in and
after 24 months; battery charger performance will be characterized by Georgia Power. Rapid recharge
system will be developed and located in Chattanooga (see 93 SCAT Project #13 GA).</P>

<P>The benefit: The project, in addition to developing a clean public transportation vehicle, will provide a
clean understanding of the potential of an advanced AC induction wheel motor and system on a large
(16,000 lb.) vehicle. Additionally, the effectiveness of the rapid recharge will be tested which, if
successful, can be easily modified to charge other vehicles.</P>
