<HR><BR>

<B>Project Review</B><BR>

<BR>

Martha Maiden spoke about the commercialisation of NASA. Funding for the

1km project has not been affected as NASA &amp; IGBP are highly supportive

of the project. The pathfinder program provides stability.<BR>

<BR>

Alessandra Buongiorno, representing the ESA stations described their current

operation. ESA is using LAS/ADAPS and providing stitched orbit data to the

USGS, and vice versa. Archiving on optical tape. <BR>

<BR>

Kevin Gallo - NOAA 's contribution is to ensure the recorders are scheduled.

This data is free to the USGS now.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Project Status Reports &amp; Data Acquisition (USGS)<BR>

<BR>

</B>Data comes from Tokyo university via ftp now, ~3 scenes per day. Possibility

of faster link from Australia to USA via Japan?<BR>

<BR>

Data from October 1993 to September 1994 will not be used for global composites

due to the Southern hemisphere being in darkness. The passes are, however,

stitched &amp; archived. <BR>

<BR>

All of the 10 day composites for April 92 - September 93 should be finished

by the end of September this year. The data will be circulated, approximately

200 tapes worth. Stitching of NOAA14 orbits will begin also in September,

using data as of 1 February 1995.<BR>

<BR>

New atmospheric corrections have been published by John R Townshend, &quot;

A version 2 AVHRR multi-resolution land pathfinder data set &quot;.<BR>

<BR>

NOAA 14 status:<BR>

- correct calibration coefficients from NOASIS web site<BR>

- thermal channels affected by seeing sunlight in the calibrating &quot;space-look&quot;

, gain calculations affected.<BR>

<B>Science Requirements &amp; Extension of Project</B><BR>

<BR>

Martha Maiden stated that NASA envisioned the project continuing indefinitely,

perhaps becoming more stabilised with time. The EROS Data Centre has strong

support for the project as part of Mission to Planet Earth. All parties

agreed to continue until September 1998 ( by which time the 1996 data should

be processed ). Information on anyone using the global product, or any other

science requirements should be fed back to NASA or EDC.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Data Processing / Product Distribution<BR>

<BR>

</B>EDC intends to get a global data set of control points due to errors

in the DCW. Interest in Australia's MSS mosaic. <BR>

<BR>

NOAA provides quality assessment of the Global product by comparing NDVI

with 8km NDVI.<BR>

<BR>

Information re the global composites is currently taking 4 to 7 months to

go online (IMS limitations).<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<B>NOAA Update</B> (Dan Tarpley)<BR>

<BR>

Dan outlined the changes with the NOAA K, L, M series: 

<UL>

  <LI>additional / replacement sensors 

  <LI>calibration changes in reflectance channels 

  <LI>1.6 &amp; 3.7 micron channel (1km group should vote in the time-sharing)

  <LI>new launch policy (on failure of previous satellite) 

  <LI>better launch rocket by NOAA L 

  <LI>NPOESS to take over ~ 2008 

</UL>

<BR>

<B>1-KM Data Set Projects, Applications, and Related Platforms</B>

<UL>

  <LI>SPOT VEGETATION Update (Gilbert Saint, JRC)<BR>

The products from the Vegetation instruments (Veg-1 &amp; Veg-2) will be

distributed by SPOT at a minimal cost. Veg-1 should begin operation in 1997,

Veg-2 in 2002. L-band reception may be free, with some charge for correction

parameters.<BR>

<BR>

  <LI>National Snow &amp; Ice Data Centre (Ted Scambos &amp; Todd Hutchinson)<BR>

NSIDC collects &amp; composites data over the poles to create products such

as albedo, surface temperature, sea-ice movement. Discussed the problems

of rapid local time changes across the poles.<BR>

<BR>

  <LI>AVHRR Calibration (Eric Vermote, University of Maryland)<BR>

Near real-time calibration using ocean and cloud views. Ratio of ch1/ch2

over the pacific ocean, where aerosol contribution is negligible, in the

presence of high altitude thick cloud (considered spectrally flat). Ozone

can be accurately measured (TOVS, SeaWIFs) thus effects due to Rayleigh

scattering can be isolated. The process currently has a 9 day turnaround.<BR>

<BR>

  <LI>AVHRR Global Fire Product (Jackie Kendal, NASA)<BR>

Fire Algorithm Working Group, NGSFC. See IGBP-DIS home page.<BR>

The objective is to provide a standard global fire product. So far have

produced a prototype data set from Global AVHRR 1km product (June 25 1992)

and are validating it against DMSP &amp; GOES data, high resolution satellite

data, and results from field experiments (SAFARI, SCAR(s), EXPRESSO, Firescan).

Hope to publish the first product March 97, on cdrom. <BR>

<BR>

  <LI>NOAA Urban Heat Island Project (Kevin Gallo, NOAA)<BR>

Using NDVI and DMSP OLS. Results: a heat island bias is likely to be present

in the observed temperatures for stations with a lower NDVI than their surrounding

landscapes. 

</UL>

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Discussion<BR>

<BR>

</B>All present reaffirmed continuation of the project. Another meeting

is expected to be held before next (Northern) summer. <BR>

<BR>

Kevin Gallo advised of the next NOAA meeting, on satellite applications,

March 4 - 6, North Carolina. Details at NOAA's website ( http://www.noaa.gov).<BR>
