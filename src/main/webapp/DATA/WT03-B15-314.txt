<H1>Recovery in Housing Market to Boost Prices in the South and Scotland</H1></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of <I>Regional
Housing Market Prospects</I>, containing detailed housing market forecasts to
the year 2005 for the standard planning regions of the UK.  These forecasts are
based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK economy, and on
its regional housing submodel.</P>
<P>Housing activity in England &amp; Wales (measured by the number of property
transactions) is expected to show growth of 7% in 1997, following an estimated
similar growth in 1996.  This follows the short-lived recovery of 1993-94 and
the collapse in activity in 1995.  The increase in housing transactions during
both years, combined with a steadily growing economy, rising employment and
falling unemployment, is expected to boost house price inflation in the UK from
an average of 4.1% in 1996 to over 7% in 1997.</P>
<P>However, prospects vary greatly by region, with the strongest increase in
activity expected in the West Midlands and London, but the largest house price
rises in the south of England outside London and Scotland, reflecting their
stronger recovery in 1996.</P>
<H2>Activity to rise despite an expected increase in mortgage rates</H2>
<P>Growth in transactions in England &amp; Wales is expected to continue at
about 7% in 1997 as projected higher mortgage rates (+1 pp) moderate the upward
push that accelerating house price inflation will give in all the markets. 
Greater London and the West Midlands are expected to see the strongest growth,
with both regions seeing better performance than in 1996.  The rising rate of
house price inflation is expected to draw people into the market, and this
effect is strengthened particularly in the case of London by the alleviation
that higher prices give to households with negative equity.</P>
<P>The Rest of the South East, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside and the North West,
regions where activity has been subdued until now, are expected to see
accelerating turnover as households' confidence strengthens.  In Yorkshire &amp;
Humberside and the North West, the boost to growth in 1997 is a response to a
strong turnaround in price inflation in 1996.  (Prices are estimated to rise by
1.8% and 3.6% respectively in 1996 following declines of 3% and 5.5% in 1995).</P>
<P>The South West, East Anglia and the East Midlands are likely to be leading
recovery in activity in 1996 and to reach levels consistent with their
underlying demand conditions.  Activity in these regions is therefore expected
to slow down in 1997, but house price inflation is likely to accelerate in
response to a firmer market (see below).</P>
<H2>Accelerating house price inflation in 1997 to be strongest in the south</H2>
<P>UK house price inflation is set to accelerate from 4.0% in 1996 to 7&#189;%
in 1997 reflecting faster economic growth and continued strong growth in
personal disposable income helped by a further expected reduction in direct
taxation in the Budget.  House price inflation in 1997 will also benefit from
the price rises of 1996, with sellers in a stronger position to resist pressure
to cut prices.</P>
<P>House prices are forecast to rise fastest in the south of England where
price inflation is supported in some cases by strong increases in activity
either currently (Greater London and the West Midlands) or in previous years
(East Anglia and the South West).  High price inflation is also forecast for
Scotland where economic growth is expected to pick up in 1997, resulting in
rising employment (for the first time since 1994) and faster growth in household
incomes.</P>
<P>The lowest house price inflation is expected in Wales and Yorkshire &amp;
Humberside,  although both regions are expected to see faster growth in prices
in 1997 than in 1996.  Activity in these regions fell sharply in 1995,
accompanied by falling prices.  A greater recovery in activity is therefore
needed before substantial upward pressure on prices is likely.  Inflation in
Northern Ireland, likely to exceed 10% in 1996, is expected to slow down in
1997.  Following two years of strong price rises and slower income growth
expected in 1996, housing is becoming less affordable.</P>
<H2>Long-term prospects in regional housing markets</H2>
<P>The strongest housing markets over the long term are forecast to be in the
regions expected to see net inward migration: East Anglia, the East Midlands and
the South West.  Housing transactions in these markets are expected to grow by
1-1&#189;% pa over 2000-05, while growth of only 0.8% pa is forecast for England
&amp; Wales as a whole over this period.  This will provide favourable
conditions for house price increases, on the assumption that the supply of new
housing does not pick up as quickly as demand growth.</P>
<P>Activity in the West Midlands and Yorkshire &amp; Humberside is expected to
be held back by a static working-age population and slow growth in the number of
households.  However, rising participation in the labour market is expected to
maintain strong upward pressure on prices in the West Midlands.</P>
<P>In general, in the long term there is expected to be a widening of the
performance differential of the northern and southern housing markets, though
the scale of earlier differentials is not forecast to be restored.</P>
<H2>In a scenario of stronger macroeconomic growth, southern markets see the
largest benefit</H2>
<P>The report also discusses the effects which a more optimistic economic
scenario would have on regional housing markets.  In the scenario a more buoyant
macroeconomic environment is assumed in 1997 with exports higher and the saving
ratio lower than the base forecast.</P>
<P>Although markets are sensitive to any increase in real interest rates in the
short term, in the longer term faster income growth dominates other factors
influencing the housing market, and activity grows by some 0.2 pp pa faster than
in the base forecast with price inflation some 0.4 pp pa faster on average. 
Since regions in the south show the fastest employment and income growth, the
housing markets in these regions see the sharpest boost.  Faster inflation
occurs again in the southern markets.</P>
<H2>Notes to Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and sectoral forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,
the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,
industrial and regional forecasts available for the UK.  The projections are
based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
UK economy (MDM), which was originally developed in the University of Cambridge
Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 by
Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and Alan
Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenous
variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients.  The
model is continually revised and improved to take account of new data and
advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.</P>
<P>The regional housing market forecasts are based on MDM and a housing
submodel that provides an integrated analysis of house prices and housing
turnover consistent with the regional macroeconomic environment.</P>
<P><I>Regional Housing Market Prospects</I> is published twice a year.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies through subscription
to the company's UK Regional Housing Market Service at &#163;4,950 per annum.</P>
