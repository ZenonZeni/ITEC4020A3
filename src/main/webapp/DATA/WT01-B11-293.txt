1.  <A NAME="1">General</A><p>

<p>1.1  The America Online Service ("AOL Service"), operated by America Online, Inc. ("AOL  Inc."), is a computer online, interactive information, communication and transaction service.   The AOL Service is available to an authorized member (hereinafter referred to as "Member," "Members," when used collectively   or "You") through a personal membership account ("Membership"); it is  accessible through a  personal computer, or other access device, using AOL Software (e.g. the software used to  connect to the AOL Service) and a communications connection (e.g., modem, telephone line).

<p>1.2  Please read this document carefully.  Please also read the "Rules of the Road."  This  document, the Rules of the Road, and the "Membership Conditions" (which You saw when You  first signed on) are all of the applicable AOL Service rules.  (They collectively comprise the  contract between AOL Inc. and Members and are collectively referred to as the "Terms of  Service" or "TOS").  You can view all of these documents on the AOL Service at any time free  of charge in the "Members' Online Support" department located within the "Member's Services"  Area. 

<p>1.3  BY COMPLETING THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND USING THE AOL SERVICE AND AOL SOFTWARE  (OTHER THAN TO READ THE TOS AGREEMENT AND THE RULES OF THE ROAD FOR THE FIRST TIME), YOU  AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE, JUST AS IF YOU HAD SIGNED  THIS AGREEMENT.  If You do not wish to be bound by our TOS, You may not continue to use the  AOL Service and AOL Software.  In that case, You should immediately terminate your  Membership account and You are prohibited from using AOL Software. 

<p>1.4  AOL Inc. may modify its TOS at any time and in any manner.  Any modification is effective  immediately upon either a posting on the AOL Service, electronic mail, or conventional mail.  If  any modification to the TOS is unacceptable to You, You may immediately terminate your  Membership as provided in Section 8 below.  YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE AOL SERVICE FOLLOWING MODIFICATION TO THE TOS SHALL BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED AS ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH MODIFICATION.

<p>1.5  The Terms of Service Agreement, Rules of the Road and the Membership Conditions  together constitute the entire and only agreement between AOL Inc. and Member with respect  to the AOL Service and AOL Software.  AOL Inc. may discontinue or alter any aspect of the  AOL Service, including, but not limited to, (i) restricting the time of availability, (ii) restricting the availability and/or scope of the AOL Service for certain platforms (i.e., computer types and  operating systems), (iii) restricting the amount of use permitted, and (iv) restricting or  terminating any Member's right to use the AOL Service, at AOL Inc.'s sole discretion and  without prior notice or liability.  AOL Inc. reserves the right to change or add any fees or surcharges at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' prior notice. 

<p><A NAME="2">2</A>.  Member Responsibilities

<p>2.1  Connect Charges.

<p>Member is responsible for all charges (e.g., telephone) associated with connecting to the AOL Service through an available access number.  THE ACCESS NUMBER IS  USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, A LOCAL TELEPHONE CALL.  Please read Section 2.A (ii) of the Rules of  the Road for a more detailed explanation of telephone charges or search "Local Access  Number" under the "Help" menu. To find additional or closer access numbers use keyword "Access."

<p>2.2  Equipment. 

<p>Member is responsible for obtaining or providing all telephone access lines, telephone and computer equipment (including modem), or other access device, necessary to  access the AOL Service.

<p>2.3.  Registration.  

<p>MEMBER CERTIFIES TO AOL INC. THAT HE/SHE IS AN INDIVIDUAL (E.G., NOT A CORPORATION) AND AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE.  AOL Inc. may, at its discretion, enter into special billing arrangements with employers and other entities.  A minor's parent  or legal guardian may authorize a minor's use of Member's account under adult supervision and  with assumption of all liabilities resulting from minor's use.  (Please refer to Section 2.B of the Rules of the Road).  MEMBER AGREES TO PROVIDE AOL INC. WITH ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AND  UPDATED INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE REGISTRATION TO THE AOL SERVICE ("Member  Registration Data"), including Member's legal name, address, telephone number(s), and  applicable payment data (i.e., credit card number and expiration date or checking account  information).  Member agrees to notify AOL Inc. within thirty (30) days of any changes in  Member Registration Data.  Failure to comply fully with this provision may result in immediate  suspension or termination of your right to use the AOL Service.

<p>2.4  Accounts/Charges/Payment.

<p>(a)  Accounts.

<p> The TOS applies to all sub-accounts and alternate screen names  associated with Member's principal account(s) ("Master Account(s)").  Each Member is responsible for all activities and charges resulting from use of Member's Master Account(s)  under any screen name of the Master Account(s) by any person, and for ensuring full  compliance with the TOS by all users of his/her Master Account(s). AOL Service Master  Account(s) may not be transferred without prior written approval from AOL Inc. and is subject to any limits established by AOL Inc.  

<p>(b)  Passwords.  

<p>Upon your enrollment as a Member, You will select a unique password.   Member is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her password and is liable for  any harm resulting from disclosing or allowing disclosure of any password. In the event of a  breach of security, Member will remain liable for any unauthorized use of the AOL Service until  Member notifies AOL Inc. by calling 1-800-827-6364.

<p>(c)  Payment.  

<p>Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by calling AOL  Inc. Customer Service or by using keyword "Billing." Member will pay all sales, use, value- added, personal property or other governmental tax or levy imposed on the goods or services  billed to his/her Master Account(s), other than taxes based on net income or profits of AOL Inc.   If AOL Inc. does not receive the full amount of Member's AOL Service account balance within thirty (30) days of invoice date, an additional 1.5% (or the highest amount allowed by law,  whichever is lower) per month late charge will be added to Member's bill and shall be due and  payable.  Member shall also be liable for all attorney and collection fees arising from AOL Inc.'s  efforts to collect any unpaid balance of Member's Master Account(s). 

<p>2.5  Online Conduct.  

<p>Any conduct by a Member that in AOL Inc.'s discretion restricts or inhibits any other Member from using or enjoying the AOL Service will not be permitted.  Member  agrees to use the AOL Service only for lawful purposes. Member is prohibited from posting on  or transmitting through the AOL Service any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing,  defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable material of any kind, including, but not limited to, any material which encourages conduct that  would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable  local, state, national or international law.

<p>2.6  Content

<p>(a)  Proprietary Rights.

<p>Member acknowledges that the AOL Service contains  information, software, photos, video, graphics, music, sounds or other material (collectively, "Content") that are protected by copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other proprietary  rights, and that these rights are valid and protected in all forms, media and technologies  existing now or hereinafter developed. All Content is copyrighted as a collective work under the  U.S. Copyright laws, and AOL Inc. owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement  and enhancement of such Content.  Member may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in  the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit, any of the Content, in whole  or in part. If no specific restrictions are displayed, Member may make copies of portions of the  Content, including copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary materials, provided  that the copies are made only for Member's personal use and that Member maintains any  notices contained in the Content such as all copyright notices, trademark legends or other  proprietary rights notices.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence or as permitted by the fair use privilege under the U.S. copyright laws (see e.g. 17 U.S.C. Section 107), You may not upload,  post, reproduce, or distribute Content protected by copyright, or other proprietary right, without  obtaining permission of the copyright owner.  Use of any software Content shall be governed by  the software license agreement accompanying such software or, if none exists, then such use  shall be proscribed by the terms governing licensing and use of the AOL Software as provided  in Section 6 herein.

<p>(b) Distribution/Uploading of Third Party Content.

<p>Member may upload to the software  files or otherwise distribute on the AOL Service only Content that is not subject to any copyright  or other proprietary rights protection (collectively, "Public Domain Content"), or Content in which  the author has given express authorization for on-line distribution.  Any copyrighted Content  submitted with the consent of a copyright owner should contain a phrase such as "Copyright  owned by [name of the owner]; Used by Permission."  The unauthorized submission of  copyrighted or other proprietary Content constitutes a breach of the TOS and could subject You  to criminal prosecution as well as personal liability for damages in a civil suit.  Remember You,  not AOL Inc. or its independent contractors, are liable for any damage resulting from any  infringement of copyrights, proprietary rights, or any other harm arising from such submission.     By submitting Content to any "Public Area" (Public Area(s) are those areas of the AOL Service  that are generally accessible to other Members, such as chat rooms, message boards, and file  uploads) You automatically grant, or warrant that the owner of such Content has expressly granted, AOL Inc. the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to  use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate and distribute the Content (in whole or part)  worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known  or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such Content. You  also permit any Member to access, view, store or reproduce the Content for that Member's  personal use.  Subject to this grant, the owner of Content placed on the AOL Service retains  any and all rights which may exist in such Content.

<p>(c)  Export.  

<p>The U.S. export control laws regulate the export and re-export of  technology originating in the United States.  This includes the electronic transmission of  information and software to foreign countries and to certain foreign nationals.  Member agrees  to abide by these laws -- including but not limited to the Export Administration Act, the Arms  Export Control Act and their implementing regulations -- and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from the AOL Service to either a foreign  national or a foreign destination without first obtaining any required government authorization.   Member further agrees not to upload to the AOL Service any data or software that cannot be  exported without prior written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software.  This assurance and commitment shall survive termination of the  Agreement.  In addition, because the U.S. export control laws currently prohibit nationals of  Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Syria from gaining access to certain Content on the AOL  Service, nationals of these countries currently may not legally access the AOL Service at this time.

<p>(d)  Benefit of Provisions.  

<p>The foregoing provisions of this section 2.6 are for the benefit of AOL Inc.   and its independent third-party information providers ("Information Providers"), merchants ("Merchants") and  licensors ("Licensors"), and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly on their  own behalf. 

<p>2.7  Third Party Content.  

<p>AOL Inc. is a distributor (and not a publisher) of Content supplied by  third parties and Members.  Accordingly, AOL Inc.  has no more editorial control over such Content than  does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand.  Any opinions, advice, statements, services,  offers, or other information or Content expressed or made available by third parties, including  Information Providers, Merchants (as defined herein), Members, or any other user of the AOL  Service, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of AOL Inc.  NEITHER AOL  INC. NOR ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER OF INFORMATION GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS,  OR USEFULNESS OF ANY CONTENT, NOR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  (Refer to Section 5 below for the complete provisions governing limitation of liabilities  and disclaimers of warranty.) 

<p>In many instances, the Content available through the AOL Service represents the  opinions and judgments of the respective Information Provider, Member, or other user not  under contract with AOL Inc.  AOL Inc. neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy or  reliability of any opinion, advice or statement made on the AOL Service by anyone other than  authorized AOL Inc. employee spokespersons while acting in their official capacities. (Forum leaders and Member Guides are not authorized spokespersons.)  Under no circumstances will  AOL Inc. be liable for any loss or damage caused by a Member's reliance on information  obtained through the AOL Service.  It is the responsibility of Member to evaluate the accuracy,  completeness or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other Content available through the AOL Service.  Please seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, regarding  the evaluation of any specific information, opinion, advice, or other Content.

<p>2.8  Retention of Files.  

<p>Member is responsible for retention of all files, information data and  other materials as may be necessary for reconstruction of any files, information material or  messages lost or misprocessed by AOL Inc.


<p><A NAME="3">3</A>.  Third-Party Sales and Services

<p>3.1  Member may order and purchase merchandise or services from other Members and users  of the AOL Service, who are not affiliated with AOL Inc.  All transactions concerning third-party  ("Merchant") goods or services, including, but not limited to, purchase terms, payment terms,  warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between Merchant and Member.   AOL Inc. makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any good or  service provided or offered by any Merchant.  AOL Inc. shall not be a party to a transaction between  Member and Merchant, or be liable for any cost or damage arising either directly or indirectly  from any action or inaction of any Merchant.


<p>AOL Inc.'s Rights

<p>4.1  AOL Inc. may elect to electronically monitor the Public Areas for adherence to its TOS and may disclose any Content, records or electronic communication of any kind (i) to satisfy any law, regulation or authorized governmental request, (ii)  if such disclosure is necessary to operate the AOL Service, or (iii) to protect the rights or property of AOL Inc., its Members, or Information Providers or Merchants.

<p>4.2  AOL Inc. reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content which it deems in its discretion to be harmful to individual Members, the communities which make up the AOL Service, AOL Inc.'s or other third-party rights, or to violate any applicable law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither AOL Inc. nor its Information Providers have the practical ability to restrict conduct, communication or Content which might violate its TOS prior to transmission on the AOL Service, nor can they ensure prompt editing or removal of questionable Content after on-line posting. Accordingly, neither AOL Inc. nor any Information Provider shall assume liability for any action or inaction with respect to conduct, communication or Content on the AOL Service.

<p>4.3  AOL Inc. will not intentionally monitor or disclose any private electronic communication unless permitted or required by law.  AOL Inc. may terminate immediately without notice any Member who misuses or fails to abide by the TOS, including, without limitation, misuse of the software libraries, discussion boards, E-Mail, or conference areas.

<p>4.4  Unless Member elects otherwise by selecting the appropriate "Marketing Preference" choice (Keyword "Marketing Preferences"), AOL Inc. reserves the right to distribute to merchants or third parties certain general Member information, such as Member's name and mailing address.  AOL Inc. will  not distribute specific Member billing information (i.e. credit card or checking account numbers).


<p>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

<p>5.1 MEMBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE AOL SERVICE IS AT MEMBER'S SOLE RISK. NEITHER AOL INC., ITS EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, LICENSORS OR THE LIKE, WARRANT THAT THE AOL SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE;  NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE AOL SERVICE, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION, SERVICE, OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED THROUGH THE AOL SERVICE.  NEITHER AOL INC. NOR ANY OF ITS INDEPENDENT NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, THAT ANY AVAILABLE ACCESS NUMBER WILL BE A LOCAL CALL FROM YOUR AREA CODE AND EXCHANGE.

<p>5.2 THE AOL SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OTHER THAN THOSE WARRANTIES WHICH ARE IMPLIED BY AND INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION OR MODIFICATION UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT.  NO ORAL ADVICE OR WRITTEN INFORMATION GIVEN BY AOL, INC., ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS (INCLUDING MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES OR GUIDES), THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, LICENSORS OR THE LIKE, SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY; NOR SHALL MEMBER RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.

<p>5.3 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL AOL INC., OR ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING THE AOL SERVICE OR THE AOL SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE AOL SERVICE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RELIANCE BY A MEMBER ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED ON THE AOL SERVICE; OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR E-MAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION, OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE,WHETHER OR NOT LIMITED TO ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO AOL INC.'S RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES.  MEMBER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS PARAGRAPH 5.3 SHALL APPLY TO ALL CONTENT, MERCHANDISE OR SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AOL SERVICE. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES AOL'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

<p>5.4 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF AOL INC., OR ITS EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS OR LICENSORS, FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EITHER JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT PAID BY MEMBER TO AOL INC. IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIMED INJURY OR DAMAGE. The foregoing provisions of this Section 5 are for the benefit of AOL Inc., its employees, directors, affiliates, agents, Information Providers, Merchants and Licensors, and each shall have the right to assert and enforce the provisions directly on their own behalf.


<p>6. Software License and Use

<p>6.1 AOL Inc. grants to Member a limited license to use AOL Software under the following terms and conditions.  All AOL Software provided to You, and each revised version thereof, is licensed, not sold, to You by AOL Inc. only for use in connecting to the AOL Service from the United States of America, Canada, and other authorized locations internationally.

You agree to destroy all AOL Software and related written material together with any copies promptly when no longer needed or authorized for use, including when termination of Membership is effected as provided herein.

<p>7. Indemnification

<p>7.1 Upon request of AOL Inc., Member agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AOL Inc. its officers, directors, employees, agents, third party Information Providers, Merchants and Licensees, from any claims and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, related to any violation of the TOS by use of Member's Master Account(s), or in connection with the placement or transmission by or through Member of any Content on the AOL Service and its third party Information Providers, Merchants and Members. 


<p>8. Termination.

<p>8.1 Either Member or AOL Inc. may terminate Membership at any time.  Member's only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with any (i) TOS term or policy, guideline, or practice of AOL Inc. in operating the AOL Service, (ii) Content available through the AOL Service or change therein, or (iii) change in the amount or type of fees charged in connection with the AOL Service, is to terminate Membership by delivering notice to AOL Inc., effective the day AOL Inc. receives notification of termination or such specified future date as may be acceptable to AOL Inc.  In the event that a Member's Master Account is terminated or canceled, any online time credited to Member's Master Account(s) is not convertible to cash or other form of credit.

<p>8.2 AOL Inc. may terminate Membership, or suspend any individual Member's access to all or part of the AOL Service, without notice, for any conduct that AOL Inc. in its sole discretion believes violates the TOS, interferes with another Member's enjoyment of the AOL Service, or is harmful to another Member, third-party Information Provider, Merchant, Licensor, service provider or AOL Inc.'s interests.

<p>General

<p>A.  These Rules of the Road set forth how America Online, Inc.  ("AOL Inc.") will operate the America Online Service ("AOL Service") and how Members may use the AOL Service. The Rules of the Road also explain many practical aspects of using the AOL Service.  Please read this document carefully and refer to it as often as necessary.  You should also read the Terms of Service ("TOS") Agreement.  This document, the TOS Agreement, and the Membership Conditions (which you saw when you first signed on) are all of the applicable AOL Service rules and collectively comprise the contract between AOL Inc. and Members and are referred to as the "Terms of Service" or "TOS."  You can view all of the TOS on the AOL Service at any time free of charge in the "Members' Online Support" department located within the "Members Services" area.

<p>B.  We believe that these Terms of Service will enhance AOL Inc.'s efforts to make the AOL Service informative, entertaining and, above all, FUN!! for all our Members.  We have tried to explain clearly our Terms of Service, but if any aspect of the TOS is unclear, we welcome your comments.  We hope that these Terms of Service will foster an online community where there is both free exchange of ideas and information, and respect for individual and community rights.


<p>Access

<p>(i) Equipment.  

<p>Most Members will access the AOL Service through a standard residential telephone line, a modem, and a personal computer.  (Please remember that when you are connected to the AOL Service, your telephone or other communications equipment, e.g., fax, cannot be operated on the same line at the same time.)  There are a variety of personal computers that are capable of accessing and using the AOL Service.  For specific technical questions, use the keyword "TechLive." Tech Live is currently open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. (Eastern time) and weekends from 12 p.m. to 1 a.m.

<p>(ii) Telephone Charges.  

<p>You are responsible for all telephone charges incurred in connecting to the AOL Service through the most locally available access number(s) (sometimes referred to as the local access nodes). DEPENDING ON YOUR PARTICULAR LOCATION, THE ACCESS NUMBER IS USUALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS A LOCAL TELEPHONE CALL. To find additional or closer access numbers use keyword "Access." If you have any questions about which telephone number is best or whether an access number is a local call, please check with your local phone company.  Any disputes or problems regarding phone service are strictly between Member and the applicable local phone company and/or long distance service provider.

<p>Please note that AOL Inc. does not maintain the access numbers used to connect to the AOL Service;  rather they are owned and operated by independent network service providers.  MEMBERS ACCESSING THE AOL SERVICE FROM CANADA WILL BE ASSESSED A SURCHARGE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY TWELVE (12) DOLLARS PER HOUR.

<p>If you cannot currently find an access number that is a local call, check the "New Access Number Updates," which is updated monthly and available in the free Members' Online Support department.  (We are continuously expanding the list of local numbers.)  You can also call your long-distance telephone company to see if a calling plan is available to allow you to call a long-distance access number for a flat rate, or to purchase blocks of calling time in advance at a discount.


<p>Your AOL Service Account

<p>(i) YOU MUST BE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE TO REGISTER FOR THE AOL SERVICE AND BECOME AN AUTHORIZED MEMBER; HOWEVER, A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN MAY AUTHORIZE A MINOR TO USE HIS/HER ACCOUNT(S) UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION. In that case, the parent or legal guardian recognizes that he/she is fully responsible for the online conduct of such minor, for controlling the minor's access to and use of the AOL Service, and for the consequences of any misuse. The AOL Service offers a "Parental Control" feature that enables the Master Account holder to restrict access to certain areas and features on the AOL Service. Please refer to the Parental Control area in the Members' Online Support department for an explanation of this feature.

<p>(ii) You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. For security purposes, we recommend that you change your password often. (You can do this by entering the "Change Your Personal Password" area in the free Members' Online Support department.)  Although the AOL Service offers a feature that allows you to bypass the password protection, please remember that this feature permits anyone who has access to your computer to easily access your account.  Use of this password bypass feature is at your own risk.  YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES UNDER YOUR ACCOUNT AND/OR SUB-ACCOUNT(S), INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT, UNTIL YOU NOTIFY AOL OF ANY BREACH OF SECURITY BY CALLING AOL AT 1-800-827-6364.

<p>(iii) Current rates for using the AOL Service may be obtained by using keyword "Billing."

<p>(iv) AOL reserves the right to distribute to merchants or third parties certain general Member information, such as Member's name and mailing address, unless Member elects otherwise by selecting the appropriate "Marketing Preferences" choice within the "Personal Choices" area on the AOL Service. AOL will not distribute specific billing information (i.e. credit card and checking account numbers).

<p>(v) AOL encourages you to be creative and have fun with the screen names you choose, but you are also expected to be reasonable and responsible; vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names can offend the sensibilities of many Members, and it is only common courtesy to remember this when you are selecting screen names.  You may not use a screen name to impersonate someone, or a name protected by trademark or copyright law.  You may use a name of a historical person, but not of another living person.  If you are unsure about a screen name, send us an E-Mail using the "Write to Terms of Service Staff" button under keyword "TOS," and select the "Names/Profiles Violations" button. Unfortunately, some Members occasionally select vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names as a joke, or just a momentary lapse of good judgment.  AOL Inc. reserves the right to delete any such screen name, or to request deletion.


<p>Online Conduct

<p>Please refer to Section 2.5 of the Terms of Service Agreement for AOL Inc's policy on impermissible types of online conduct. Below are some common violations of the Terms of Service. This list is not exhaustive.  AOL Inc. reserves the right, but does not assume the responsibility, to restrict communication which AOL Inc. deems in its discretion to be harmful to individual Members, damaging to the communities which make up the AOL Service, or in violation of AOL Inc.'s or any third-party rights. Please be aware, however, that communication over the AOL Service often occurs in real-time, or is posted on one of the AOL Service's thousands of message boards or libraries, and AOL Inc. cannot, and does not intend to, screen communication in advance.

<p>If you witness chat in a public chat room that violates AOL's Terms of Service, you may contact an AOL Service Guide by using the keyword "Guide Pager."  You may also contact AOL's Terms of Service Staff about any violation by using the "Write to the Terms of Service Staff" icon located in the Terms of Service area of the Member's Online Support department.


<p>Offensive Communication

<p>The AOL Service is a community-oriented service composed of many different communities of people.  Our goal is to provide an interesting, stimulating and fun place for all Members. Using vulgar, abusive or hateful language undermines this goal and is not allowed. Please use your best judgment and be respectful of other Members. Remember, there are children online.

<p>If you use vulgar, or abusive language online, even if masked by symbols or other characters, you may either receive an "on-screen-warning" by a Guide or Room Host, or in extreme cases be terminated immediately.

<p>A warning indicates that your language is not in compliance with AOL Inc.'s Rules.

<p>Should you receive such a warning, take the time to read the TOS Agreement again and these Rules of the Road posted in the free Members' Online Support department.


<p>Harassment

<p>When a Member targets another specifically to cause him/her distress, embarrassment, unwanted attention, or other discomfort, this is harassment.

<p>AOL Inc. does not condone harassment in any form and may suspend or terminate the accounts of any Member who harasses others.

<p>You may have a disagreement with someone's point of view -- we encourage lively discussion in our chat rooms and message boards -- but personal attacks, or attacks based on a person's race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation or other such affiliation, are prohibited.

<p>If you have a disagreement with someone's point of view, address the subject, not the person.


<p>Graphic Files

<p>AOL Inc. prohibits the transfer or posting on the AOL Service of sexually explicit images or other content deemed offensive by AOL Inc.


<p>Scrolling

<p>"Scrolling" means repeatedly causing the screen to roll faster than Members are able to type to it.  It is caused by a user entering a set of random characters or by repeatedly entering a carriage return or any such action to a similar disruptive effect.  Scrolling is an expressly prohibited form of disruption.


<p>Impersonation

<p>This can involve the portrayal of an account in an official capacity, such as AOL Inc. staff or an information provider, authorized Guide or Host, or communication under a false name or a name that you are not authorized to use.

<p>Members must avoid the portrayal of AOL personnel or other persons in all forms of online communication, including, but not limited to, screen names, member profiles, chat dialogue and message postings.


<p>Room Disruption

This includes purposefully interfering with the normal flow of dialogue in a chat room.  Room disruption may occur by repeatedly interrupting conversation between Members, or by acting in such a way as to antagonize, harass or create hostility in a chat room.


<p>Chain Letters and Pyramid Schemes

<p>Transmission of chain letters and pyramid schemes of any kind is not allowed on the AOL Service.  This material places an unnecessary load on our mail system and is considered a nuisance by many Members.

<p>Certain chain letters and pyramid schemes are illegal.

<p>Letters or messages that offer a product or service based on the structure of a chain letter are also of questionable legality. At minimum, they are a waste of resources and are not permitted on the AOL Service.


<p>Advertising and Solicitation

<p>You may not use the AOL Service to send unsolicited advertising, promotional material, or other forms of solicitation to other Members except in those specified areas that are designated for such a purpose (e.g., the classified area).


<p>Internet Access and Conduct

<p>The AOL Service will soon feature comprehensive access to the Internet. When using the Internet and all of its components, Members must conduct themselves responsibly according to the Internet's own particular code of conduct. Participating successfully on the Internet is really a matter of common sense. Although AOL Inc. does not control the Internet, your conduct on the Internet when using your AOL account is subject to the Terms of Service. Because AOL Inc. wants to be a good Internet citizen, it prohibits Members from engaging in certain conduct on the Internet through or by means of the AOL Service including the following:

<p>(i) Chain Letters.  Chain letters are prohibited on the AOL Service and are inappropriate on the Internet.  Posting a chain letter to an Internet newsgroup (or via E-Mail on the Internet) may result in your AOL Service account being terminated.

<p>(ii) Commercial Communication.  The vast majority of newsgroups and mailing lists on the Internet are not commercial in nature and participants in such groups may object strongly to commercial postings, solicitations, or advertisements.

<p>(iii) Other Inappropriate Posts.  Each newsgroup and mailing list on the Internet focuses on a particular set of topics and posts not related to these topics are not welcomed by the participants.  We suggest that all AOL Service Members become familiar with the guidelines, themes, and culture of the specific newsgroups and mailing list in which they wish to participate. Posting patently inappropriate material on the Internet may result in suspension or termination of your AOL Service account.

<p>(iv) Copyrighted and Proprietary Materials.  Transmitting to the Internet copyrighted or other proprietary material of any kind without the express permission of the right holder is prohibited and will result in termination of your membership and possible civil and/or criminal liability.

<p>Additionally, AOL Inc. does not control the Internet and therefore use of the Internet is at Member's own risk.  Members should exercise their discretion and supervision when allowing any minors under their Master Account to access the Internet.


<p>Third-Party Content and Information.

<p>Because AOL Inc. encourages open and candid communication, it cannot determine in advance the accuracy of Content transmitted on the AOL Service. AOL is not responsible for screening, policing, editing, or monitoring such Content.  If notified of allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal or offensive Content, AOL Inc. may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such Content from the AOL Service.  AOL Inc. shall be held harmless from any performance or non-performance by AOL Inc. of such activities, as long as it has acted in good faith.

<p>Please use your best judgment in evaluating all information contained or opinions expressed on the AOL Service.  You should be at least as careful in your evaluation of such information and opinions on the AOL Service as you are in everyday life.  It is AOL Inc.'s policy not to endorse, oppose, or edit any opinion expressed by a Member or information or material provided by an independent contractor.

<p>Independent contractors who supply information or content to the AOL Service ("Information Provider") endeavor to make it accurate and reliable, but do not guarantee or warrant as so.  In some instances, the information provided may represent opinion and judgment and/or may have been supplied by a Member not in any way under a contract with AOL Inc. 


<p>Purchasing Products and Services through the AOL Service

<p>Please remember that AOL Inc. does not endorse, warrant or guarantee any product or service offered through the AOL Service and will not be a party to any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.  As with the purchase of a product or service through any medium or in any environment, you should use your best judgment and exercise caution where appropriate.  Blind opportunity ads and "get rich quick" schemes should be approached with ample skepticism.  The AOL Service cannot mediate disputes and cannot assume responsibility for any outcome.  Be careful, be smart, have fun!

<p>Public and Private Communication

<p>The AOL Service offers Members the capability to communicate in Public Areas generally accessible to other Members or to communicate privately with another Member.  Public Areas are those features that are generally accessible to other Members, such as, but not limited to, chat rooms, online forums, and message boards.  Private Communication is electronic correspondence sent or received by you to particular individuals. AOL Inc. will maintain the AOL Service Public Areas as an open forum for discussion of a wide range of issues and expression of diverse viewpoints. AOL Inc. will administer standards of online conduct according to its TOS for the enjoyment of all its Members. While we will endeavor to monitor the Public Areas to ensure that online standards are being maintained, AOL Inc. has neither the practical capability, nor does it intend, to act in the role of "Big Brother" by screening public communication in advance.


<p>It is AOL Inc.'s policy to respect the privacy of personal electronic communication.  AOL Inc. will not intentionally inspect the contents of an electronic message ("E-Mail" or "Instant Message") sent by one Member to another individual, monitor discussions in private rooms, or dislose the contents of any personal electronic communication to an unauthorized third party, except as required or permitted to do so by law.  AOL  Inc. reserves the right to cooperate fully with local, state, or federal officials in any investigation relating to any Content, including private electronic communication, transmitted on the AOL Service or the unlawful activities of any Member.

<p>AOL Inc. reserves the right to remove any Content that it deems in its sole discretion to be a violation of its Terms of Service.  AOL Inc. may terminate immediately any Member who misuses or fails to abide by its Terms of Service.

<p>AOL, Inc.'s current general practice is that (i)  E-Mail is retained on the AOL Service for five (5) days after the date it is read and then permanently deleted, and (ii)  unread E-Mail is kept on the AOL Service for approximately thirty (30) days;  however, AOL Inc. makes no warranties of any kind with respect to its E-Mail service and is not responsible for any message which may be misprocessed by AOL Inc.  AOL Inc. reserves the right to change its general E-Mail practice at any time without notice.  If a screen name is deleted, any unread E-Mail sent prior to that deletion will also be removed, as a deleted screen name cannot be reinstated.
