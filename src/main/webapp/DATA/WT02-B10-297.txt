We appreciate your interest in creating your own User Pages with Super Zippo. If you have a 6- or 12-month subscription with Super Zippo, we can reserve 3MB of space to put up your user pages. We just need to get a URL address from you in the following format, replacing the "name" portion below:<p>

        <center>http://super.zippo.com/~name</center><p>

Needs to be between 6-8 lowercase, alphanumeric characters. Most use their SZ username, but you can use whatever you would like, as long as it does not conflict with another user of the service. Once we receive, we'll have the space reserved, and then confirm by email with instructions on how to proceed in uploading your files.<p> 

We'll also setup a link to the page at the Super Zippo Web site. With the user pages, we request that users not include any binary images consisting of adult-theme material,  or software archives, due to system bandwidth restrictions.<p> 

We hope this information is helpful. Please forward the information requested above, as well as your Super Zippo username to <a href="mailto:mike@zippo.com">mike@zippo.com</a>, in order to have access to the user pages setup.<p>
