<CENTER><H3><B>"CHAIRMAN'S MARK"<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


<center><b>Substitute Bill Would Include Majority of Coalition's
Recommendations</b></center><P>

As mentioned in a previous message, the mark up of the House's IDEA reauthorization
bill by the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities has been postponed
until next Thursday, May 30, so that the Congressmen could focus on the minimum
wage issue.<P>

As you know, a coalition of education and disability groups have been working on a
variety of proposals to amend the current House bill.  Committee staff have reported
that approximately 95% of the changes recommended by the coalition were accepted,
and Committee Chair Rep. Bill Goodling (R-PA) will reportedly begin the mark up next
week with a substitute bill.<P>

This "Chairman's Mark" would include the following issues.  Keep in mind that this is
still a fluid process, and changes to the "Chairman's Mark" could still be made before
next week's mark up. <P>
<HR>

<center><B>Accepted from Education/Disability Group Proposal </b>
</center><P>

<OL><LI><B> DISCIPLINE--</b>Federalizes the definitions of IDEA's discipline
provisions.  "Weapon" and "drug" definitions are taken from the Federal sentencing
guidelines and the Federal Controlled Substances Act. <p>
The definition of "serious injury" was proposed by the education/disability group and is
much broader than the term it replaced in H.R. 3268, "assault and battery."  "Serious
injury" is defined as "an injury that involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical
pain, obvious or protracted disfigurement, loss of use of body members or organs,
broken bones, or significant endangerment to a person's emotional health or safety,
that is the result of a physical or verbal assault."<P>
     Expressly provides that schools may report a crime committed by a child with a
     disability to the appropriate authorities.  This language, frequently referred to as the
     Chris L. Case language, is also in the 1994's Improving America's Schools Act, but
     has been ignored by the Federal court in Chris L. for IDEA children.<p>
     Adds a constructive knowledge exception to the general rule limiting IDEA
protections  to students previously identified as disabled.<p>
     Provides that educational services may be ceased, consistent with local law, for only
     weapons or drugs cases in the cases where such action is not related to the child's
     disability.  H.R. 3268 currently also includes "assault and battery" in this category. 
     The Education/Disability Group did not come to consensus on this issue.<P>

<li><b>   ATTORNEY'S FEES</b> -- This language keeps the standard for determining
which claims merit fees at current law.  It will prevent fees for IEP meetings, except
where such meetings are ordered by a court in due process.<P>

<LI><B>   MEDIATION</B> -- The language creates "pre-due process" mediation that
would be obligatory for both parties and would not include attorneys for either side. 
Either side may waive such mediation after making a "good faith effort."  Mediation after
this point would be consistent with state law for attorney's fees and attorney
participation.<P>

<li>  <B> IEPs</b> -- Individualized Education Programs will now include either short
term objectives or benchmarks in addition to annual measurable goals.<P>

<li> <B>  STATE-LOCAL ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES</b> -- This language
will require the Governor to establish interagency agreements detailing the
responsibilities for providing and paying for related services in LEAs.<P>

<LI><B>  MODIFICATIONS OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS</b> -- This provision
sets additional limits on the modifications which are agreeable to both the education
groups and the disability groups.  These are: in accordance with state law, who are
making annual progress in applicable course work, and for a period not to exceed three
years.<P>

<LI> <B> STATE SET-ASIDE</b> -- The provision returns the allowable percentage of
state-retained funds to 25% but keeps the administrative funds at 3%.  The provision
also will require states to report how the money was spent.<P>

<li><B>   SUPPLEMENTARY AIDS AND SERVICES</b> -- A definition for
supplementary aids and services will be included in H.R. 3268.<P>

<li><B>  ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</b> -- This provision from
current law is being reinstated.  It prohibits the Secretary from making a grant under the
discretionary programs relating to 3-5 year old children to any agency or institution in a
state which does not have a 619 (preschool) program.</ol><P>

<b>Other Changes</b><P>

<ol><LI><B>PART C SERVICE DELIVERY IMPROVEMENT DEMONSTRATION
PROJECTS</b>  -- This section will allow the Secretary to make grants to up to 3 State
agencies for demonstration projects to develop innovative new mechanisms for
improving the quality of services and controlling the costs of services delivered to
infants and toddlers with disabilities.  This item was not part of the proposal from the
coalition but is being included at the direction of Mr. Goodling.<P>

<LI> <B> COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT
(CSPD)</b>-- The provision inserts a requirement for a comprehensive system of
personnel development similar to that which is in current law.  The management of the
program from the Federal level will be less than current law.<P>

<li><B>  EDUCATIONAL MEDIA ACTIVITIES</b> -- After 1998, this provision limits
captioning and descriptive video to educational, news, and informational materials. 
     Education/Disability Group wanted to maintain current law, which would allow
unlimited captioning.</ol><P>

<B>Recommendations not taken/Items dropped</b><P>

<OL><LI><B>10 LEA PROJECT</b> -- This project would have allowed up to 10 LEAs
or groups of LEAs to request a waiver from specific provisions of Part B from the
Secretary in order to demonstrate new and innovative ways of providing special
education and related services.<P>

<LI><B>   DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS</b> -- The Education/Disability Group
recommended going back to current law and the 14 separate programs.  The
Administration's bill condensed these programs down into five programs and H.R. 3268
condensed them into three.  The compromise reached with the Democrats provides for
four discretionary programs.<P>

<li> <B>IN-STATE FUNDING FORMULA</b> -- The Group recommended that the
in-state funding formula mirror the federal formula.<P>

<LI> <B> STATE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT</b> -- The Group recommended that a
provision be included mandating that the States maintain the current level of
expenditure on special education.<P>

<LI> <B> COLLECTIVE BARGAINING</b> -- Language prohibiting anything in this law
from having an impact on collective bargaining agreements.</ol><P>

<HR>
