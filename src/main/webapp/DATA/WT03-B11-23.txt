[] IN A NEW MOVE, USA PRESBYTERIANS
CONVENE REGIONAL CAMPING MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVES
TO PROBE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF WORKING TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY

92031            CAMP MINISTRY CONSULTATION SET

LOUISVILLE, Ky.--A first for the Presbyterian Church will be a
gathering of representatives from church camp and conference
centers across the denomination.

     The national conference centers, Montreat, Ghost Ranch and
Stony Point are well-known, but there are many others serving
presbyteries and synods throughout the church.  Associates from
many of these will gather Jan. 30 and Feb. 1.  Representatives from
ministry units and other entities will also attend.

     The event will be held at General Butler State Park, located
between Louisville and Cincinnati.

     The purpose of the consultation, which is called Weaving our
Ministry, is to explore mutual benefits for partnerships.  This
will include new ways in which the camp and conference group and
the national conference centers might better assist the units and
other groups within the church in carrying out their mission.  It
also will include ways for the General Assembly entities to make
more use of the centers.

     This gathering will help prepare Presbyterian camp and
conference representatives for participation in the Council on
Religiously Affiliated Camps Consultation, according to the Rev.
Ed Craxton, staff for the event.  That consultation will held in
the spring.  It is a division of the American Camping Association.

     Anyone interested in attending the consultation Jan. 30 should
contaxt Craxton at 100 Witherspoon Street, Louisville, KY  40202-
1396, (502) 569-5447.

[] EIGHT USA CHURCH DENOMINATIONS OPPOSE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

92032       STATEMENT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ANNOUNCED

PHOENIX--Eight denominational representatives including the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), recently signed a statement against
the death penalty in Arizona.  Signing for the Presbyterian Church
were the Rev. Robert V. Chapman, executive, Presbytery of the Grand
Canyon, and the Rev. Gary Skinner, executive, Synod of the
Southwest.  Other denominational leaders signing were from the
Episcopal Church, Roman Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, Society of Friends, United Church of Christ, the
Disciples of Christ and the Unitarian-Universalist.

     The statement said:

"At this time, when 102 persons in Arizona are on death row and an
execution appears imminent, we affirm our unity in opposing capital
punishment.  As Christian leaders we want to bear witness that the
death penalty cannot be justified as a legitimate tool of society's
justice system.  The denominations we represent in Arizona all have
spoken nationally against the death penalty.

"Christians of good will disagree on the use of the death penalty
as a means of achieving justice in our society.  We acknowledge
these differences of opinion.  We also join with all of our
brothers and sisters in their feelings of anger at heinous acts of
violence and in compassion for those among us whose loved ones have
been victims of such crimes.

"While there are many important sociological arguments against
capital punishment and while empirical evidence does not
demonstrate that executing prisoners has served to reduce crime,
our opposition relies principally on our faith vision of human
dignity and solidarity.

"As Christians and, indeed, as citizens of the United States, we
are proud of the mercy as well as justice which have so often
characterized our nation's history.  We believe that punishment
should be primarily redemptive, reformative and restorative.
Capital punishment does not lead us to these goals, either for the
victim or for the criminal.  The taking of one human life to serve
notice on the lives of others is in itself violent and cruel.  The
use of the death penalty is inconsistent with the Christian calling
to honor the sanctity of all of human life.  We must work to
curtail, not to promote, violence in our society by carrying the
message of God's redeeming love in all of our public and private
interactions.

"Jesus Christ, and countless historical examples, teach us that no
human being is beyond redemption.  The institutional taking of a
human life destroys forever the opportunity to seek reconciliation
of the offender and causes all of us to share in the violent act
of killing a person.  The judgment of life and death is God's
alone.  When one human being places himself or herself in the
position of making that judgment by murdering another human being,
it is a sin.  That sin is compounded when society responds in kind.

"There should be appropriate punishment for those who commit
crimes, however it is our firm conviction that to succumb to the
retaliatory violence of capital punishment is abdicating our
responsibility as Christians and as human beings.

"Our fervent prayer is that God's redemptive love will be better
served in human affairs through the abolition of this cruel and
inhuman form of punishment.  We pray, too, that society will find
more effective ways to serve the victims of crimes and their
families, offering them assistance to recover as completely as
possible from the harm they have suffered.  May the values of mercy
and compassion which have marked the best of our nation's history
overcome the spirit of vengeance epitomized in capital punishment."

[] FROM A COMMUNITY NEWSPAPER:
NORTH CAROLINIANS SHARE CHRISTMAS WITH FOREIGN STUDENTS

92028           FOREIGN STUDENTS SHARE CHRISTMAS

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This article appeared in The Herald, in Rock Hill,
S.C.  We thought our readers would enjoy reading it.--Marj
Carpenter

ROCK HILL, S.C.--Christmas week has been a time to rest and
celebrate the holidays for about 24 foreign students visiting the
Christmas International House at Bethelwoods Christian Education
Center.

     The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)-sponsored project provides
international students who can't get home for the holidays the
chance to spend that time with others.

     One of the students, Robson Gomes, 30, of Brazil also brought
along his wife and two daughters, who are with him while he's
studying in the United States, for the holiday experience.  He is
a student at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va.

     "This has been a time to rest, a time to be with family and
a time to think," Gomes said, "and to meet different people."

     Being at Bethelwoods and enjoying the natural beauty of the
area also has given him time to remember God, he said.

     "My girls love it.  They don't want to go home" to Richmond,
he said.

     Gomes will speak at Hermon Presbyterian Church in Rock Hill.

     "I won't preach.  I talk, sharing my experiences with God.
It's not like a sermon," he said, adding that he has been at the
seminary five months and expects to graduate in May 1994.

     Michihiko Ogata, 23, has been a graduate student in computer
science at Ohio University since March 1990.

     Relaxing in the game room at Bethelwoods after a tour of WRHI-
AM radio station and before a trip to the Outlet Market Place,
Ogata, a Tokyo native, talked a little about the differences
between Christmas in his country and here.

     "We don't celebrate Christmas like this.  We don't decorate
the tree.  We don't have a big tree," he said with a smile.  "We
can go to a restaurant or department store and see trees
decorated."

     The Japanese buy small artificial trees already decorated,
Ogata said.

     This is his second Christmas away from his family and he
misses them.  But - and he smiled again - he misses his dog more.

     Bethelwoods is one of only two Christmas International Houses
in the country that are operated out of a camp, said Joel Winchip
of Columbia, S.C., a student at the Presbyterian School of
Christian Education in Richmond.

     The Presbyterian church helps match foreign students in other
areas with host families.

     The students at Bethelwoods this year come from Japan, Taiwan,
Kenya, Brazil, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  They arrived Dec. 19
and return to campuses around the country the following week.

     They register for the International House by paying $25 fee
and list the first, second and third choices they would like to
visit, Winchip said.

     Since arriving, the students have visited churches including
Oakland Avenue Presbyterian in Rock Hill and First Presbyterian in
Lancaster.  They enjoyed a Christmas party at Tirzah Presbyterian
and were entertained by the Uriel Cloggers.

     The group also has visited Kings Mountain State Park and
toured the S.C. State Museum and Zoo.  On Christmas Day, they drove
up to Montreat, N.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Before they
leave, they will tour Brattonsville, Discovery Place and the
Charlotte Observer Omnimax Theatre.

     The project is supported by Providence Presbytery, with 18
churches providing money and food for the students.

[] SCRIPT OF 'WEEKENDER', THE USA PRESBYTERIAN PHONE RECORDING:
UPDATE ON ZAIRE, HAITI, JANUARY 10-17, 1992

             WEEKENDER #124 - JANUARY 10 - 17, 1992

     Greetings from Louisville, Kentucky.  This is Betsey Kandle
for Weekender.

     Many Presbyterian mission co-workers have been hindered in
their work by political coups and civil wars that have made it
necessary for some to return to the United States.  Two nations
in particular, Zaire and Haiti, have suffered profound political
strife which is still going on.

     Tom and Noretta Clayton were forced to leave their home in
Haiti last October.  Tom Clayton spoke about his adopted country
at a worship service at the Presbyterian Center in Louisville
this week.  Here are some of his thoughts.


     "This is a time filled with confusion and rumors when your
prayers for the people of Haiti are badly, badly needed.
Meanwhile, Presbyterian work goes on, limited, but goes on.

     "The last 200 years, has seen Haiti stripped of 80% of its
forests.  Nature continues to tear at what is left of the
country.  Today, Haiti is a land of rocks and barren mountains,
with only small pockets of lush, green, life.

     "But, in a small area near the Dominican Republic border,
the people have built an irrigation canal, a project called
Chadev, with the help of mission funds from the Presbyterian
Church.  Now after ten years, they are reaping a harvest of
better and more plentiful food.  And their work continues, or at
least will when things settle down.

     "In the district of Cormiers, the people have organized
themselves and are working to reclaim a watershed area that is
home for thousands with the help of Presbyterian missionaries and
mission funds.  This project is truly ecumenical - it includes
the local Episcopal and Catholic parishes, an Evangelical School
and a small clinic run by the Catholic Little Brothers.  Rodney
Babe, a Presbyterian agriculturalist, and his wife will be
working with the project when it is appropriate for them to
return.  They left when we did in early October.  My wife, Nory,
serves as administrator of the project and liaison between the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti.

     "Today, on the island of LaGonave, in the middle of the bay,
there is a small clinic established by the local Episcopal parish
under the leadership of Pere Valdema and with the assistance of
mission funds from the Presbyterian Church.  Nory and I work very
closely with that group.  With the help of a small group of
dedicated community health workers, trained at Hospital Ste.
Croix and working with the people of the Episcopal Church located
next to the clinic, they are working to provide both
preventative and curative care to a population of more than
10,000 people.

     "In the city of Cap Haitian, there is a trade school
teaching a variety of skills in a three year course, with an
enrollment of 500.  In the country, near the city, there is an
Agricultural School with demonstration lands, teaching people to
teach agriculture.  Both of these schools are assisted by mission
funds from the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).

     "And on the southern coast of the country, in a small
village called Leogane, there is the Hospital Ste. Croix.
Started by missionaries and mission funds from the Presbyterian
Church in the early 1960's, it is now staffed entirely by
Haitians and is held as a model of what health care in Haiti can
be.  Dr. David McNeeley, a Presbyterian missionary and Episcopal
priest is the medical director.  His wife, Dr. Marise McNeeley,
also a Presbyterian missionary heads the laboratory and blood
bank.  The Drs. McNeeley are still in Haiti and although the
hospital staff has been cut in half, they are still providing
what care they can to the people of the surrounding area.  My
wife and I continue to work as consultants in pharmacy,
procurement, and administration to the hospital.

     "But we want you to understand that it is not just mission
funds or missionaries or even Haitians that get this work done.
It is through God's Grace and your prayers that His work is done.
Thank you from the people of Haiti."

[] SCRIPT FOR 'WEEKENDER', USA PRESBYTERIAN PHONE MESSAGE SERVICE:
MORE ON HAITI, ESPECIALLY CHURCH WORLD SERVICE EFFORTS AMONG REFUGEES

              WEEKENDER #125 -- JANUARY 17-24, 1992

     Greetings from Louisville, Kentucky.  This is Gregg Kapfhammer
for Weekender.

     Thousands of Haitians took to the sea in small boats last
October following the takeover of their country by the military.
They risked their lives in search of freedom and security, were
caught by the U.S. Coast Guard, and would have been returned to
Haiti except for a court restraining order which is now under
appeal by the Justice Department.  They are confined in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, awaiting the resolution of their destiny.

     As it always does, the church is reaching out to the refugees
through organizations such as Church World Service and Witness and
the U.S. Catholic Conference.  And it is speaking out to Congress
and the Administration, urging justice for the Haitians.

     Dale S. DeHaan, director of the Church World Service
Immigration and Refugee Program, testified before a congressional
immigration sub-committee last November.  He strongly urged
Congress not to allow the administration to return Haitian refugees
to their country by force.  He reminded them of the Immigration Act
of 1990 which authorizes the Attorney General to grant Temporary
Protected Status to nationals from countries experiencing war,
natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions that endanger
physical safety.  While DeHaan acknowledged that such a grant is
not always the appropriate or necessary response to refugee crises,
he urged that this protection be extended to the Haitians.

     The Church World Service Immigration and Refugee Program is
attempting to resettle 600 of the nearly 1200  Haitians determined
by the government to have a reasonable claim for asylum in the
United States.  Presbyterian churches interested in helping to
resettle Haitian families are encouraged to call the Presbyterian
World Service office in the Social Justice and Peacemaking Ministry
Unit.  The number is 502-569-5840.  Social Justice and Peacemaking
is assisting this program with funds designated for the asylum
program.  To contribute, send gifts through the normal receiving
channels.  Mark them for the Haitian Crisis.

     That concludes this Weekender report.  To speak with someone
about Presbyterian concerns, call this number, 1-800-UP2DATE, from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday.

NEWS IN BRIEF
FOR CIRCUIT WRITER,
THE UNITED METHODIST COMPUTER COMMUNICATION SERVICE

                                       Jan. 17, 1992

   Of the 50 active U.S. United Methodist bishops, 34 have signed
statements supporting transfers of U.S. bishops across geographically
determined jurisdictional lines, reflecting a never-before-used church
provision.  Eleven said they meet requirements for such transfers and
are willing to serve "wherever assigned," and another 23 active bishops
and 19 retired bishops signed the appeal in support of their colleagues.

   The Rev. Zdravko Beslov, a United Methodist pastor and conference
superintendent in Bulgaria, will become the 15th person to receive the
1992 World Methodist Peace Award in recognition of his efforts to bring
reconciliation and healing in his country.

   United Methodist Bishop Felton E. May, Harrisburg, Pa., Jan. 10 called
on U.S. faith communities to set aside 10 percent of their budgets and
reserve funding "over and above what we are already doing" to fight "the
spiritual crisis" of drugs and violence.  The money, May told the (U.S.)
President's Drug Advisory Council, could "serve as a pump primer" until
"redirected government funds reach the points of need."

   Hope was voiced to U.S. United Methodists visiting Cuba recently that
the U.S. government could be convinced to end its embargo against Cuba.
The Rev. Pedro Mayor, a Cuban Methodist pastor, said that the United
States should at least allow shipment of food and medicine.  Bishop Joel
Ajo of the Methodist Church in Cuba said the blockade is "denying
medicine for our own children and our sick elderly."  The United
Methodist General Conference in 1984 called for lifting the embargo.

   Thousands of boxes of food are being packed in New Windsor, Md., by
volunteers under auspices of the United Methodist Committee on Relief
for shipment by ocean freight to for hungry residents of Moscow.
Additional volunteers to handle the packing are needed.

   United Methodist Bishop David J. Lawson, Sun Prairie, Wisc., and
members of his cabinet have voiced grave concern about membership
recruitment efforts by the Ku Klux Klan in the southeastern part of the
state.  Church members are called on to "make clear that the teaching
and values of the Klan are unacceptable in our communities."

   A dispute between United Methodist-related Boston University and
Coretta Scott King about possession of 83,000 documents of the late Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. must go to trial March 2, a Massachusetts state
judge ruled Jan. 12.  The civil-rights leader's widow has sought return
of papers, while university officials claim King entrusted the papers
to the school with an understanding they would become university
property at his death.  King, who held a doctorate degree from the
university, was assassinated in 1968.

   The Rev. Miron A. Morrill, 93, who was inducted into the United
Methodist Association of Communicators' Hall of Fame in November, died
Jan. 9 in Hesston, Kan., after a lengthy illness.  Morrill directed
press relations for the 1939 Uniting Conference in which three Methodist
bodies became the Methodist Church, and served in 1929-40 in various
posts for the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predecessor body of the
United Methodist Church.  Services were held Jan. 11 in Hesston.  He is
survived by his widow, Naomi.

      INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (DNS) -- Two Ohio women will lead the
boards of directors for the higher education and overseas
ministries units of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) for
the next two years.
      The Rev. Robin E. Hedgeman of Elyria was installed in
November as chairwoman of the Division of Overseas Ministries
board of directors. Hedgeman, associate regional minister for the
Christian Church in Ohio, will lead the DOM governing board until
1993.
      The Rev. Linda Walling of Cleveland is the new chairwoman
for the Division of Higher Education board of directors. Walling,
an associate minister at Heights Christian Church, succeeds the
Rev. Kenneth L. Teegarden of Fort Worth. Hedgeman's and Walling's
appointments are among the highlights of a month-long round of
meetings of general unit governing boards.
      The DOM board also approved six persons for overseas
appointments and named Disciples Africa executive, the Rev. Dan C.
Hoffman, acting executive director of the Common Ministry in
Africa. Hoffman will direct the overseas missions activities for
the DOM and the United Church Board for World Ministries.
      Holly Stovall of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve for two years
with the Disciples of Christ in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she
will work in a day-care center and other outreach ministries.
      Virginia Wilson, Olympia, Wash., was appointed to a two-year
term with the Japan-North America Commission on Cooperative
Mission. She will teach English in a church-related school or
institution in Japan.
      Elvira Likay Arndt, Dr. Joyce Baker and the Rev. John Huegel
were ratified for Common Ministry appointments in Ecuador,
Honduras and Mexico. In other action, Nancy Moulin, Reno, Nev.,
was assigned to a three-year appointment with the United Mission
to Nepal where she will direct the Andhi Khola Project.
      In action taken by the boards of other general units, the
Rev. Raymond E. Brown of Indianapolis has been named interim
president of the Church Finance Council. He succeeds the Rev.
James P. Johnson who becomes president of the Christian Church
Foundation in January 1992. Brown retired in November as senior
vice-president of the Board of Church Extension.
      The Disciples of Christ Historical Society in November
closed its 50th anniversary celebration with a special lecture
series. Richard Harrison of Vanderbilt Divinity School and Douglas
Foster of Abilene (Texas) Christian University addressed the
lecture theme: "Holding Back the Tide: T.B. Larimore and J.W.
McGarvey in the Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ
Division."
      The board of directors, meeting in conjunction with the
lectures, also approved for 1993 an expansion and redesign of the
quarterly journal "Discipliana"; and set Wilson, N.C., as the site
for the 1993 Forrest F. Reed Lectures. The Rev. Kenneth Henry of
the Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Ga., will be
the guest lecturer and will address historic aspects of the Black
Disciples of Christ movement.
      Trustees of the National Benevolent Association recently
approved the purchase of two care facilities for older adults, and
authorized expansion projects involving Robin Run Village in
Indianapolis, and the Beasley Building - home offices for NBA and
the Division of Higher Education - in St. Louis.
      The acquisitions of Village at Skyline at Colorado Springs,
Colo., and Patriot Heights in San Antonio, Texas, bring to 72 the
number of care facilities related to the NBA.
      The Division of Homeland Ministries board, in its recent
meeting, dealt primarily with staff and division restructure and
budget matters, including staff salary increases. Also on the
agenda was a review of the process leading the division to
reorganize into three "ministry centers" intended to focus its
programs more effectively upon congregational ministry.

"SEARCH FOR SPIRITUALITY" TO BROADCAST ON ABC-TV   91b-119

December 11, 1991   Contact: Clifford L. Willis
      NEW YORK, N.Y. (DNS) -- As Americans prepare to address the
quincentary of Columbus' journey to this land, another voyage of a
different kind is being acknowledged . . .  a journey in search of
the spirituality of this nation and its people.
      Intrigued by the seeming emergence of a cultural phenomenon,
the National Council of Churches is documenting the revitalization
of American spirituality in the fourth program of the "Vision and
Values" series on ABC-TV. The program, "Search for Spirituality,"
will be broadcast to ABC affiliates on January 19, 1992. It will
air locally at 1:30 p.m. on WRTV, Channel 6.
      It has been rumored in the media that the movement of
Americans back to church and religion may well mark the popular
trend of the `90s. "Search for Spirituality" probes the questions
that surround the suggestion. Is spirituality just another decade
motif to ring out a century that was marked in the `60s with
revolution, the `70s with drugs, and the `80s with money? Or is it
the bona fide search of a society in pursuit of the boundaries of
collective harmony and corrective healing?
      "There is no question that we're finding a spiritual hunger
from people of all walks of life," said the Rev. Theodore
Nottingham, director of video production for the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), an NCC member communion and program
cosponsor.
      "Unfortunately some people look outside the church for what
is truly the church's mission," Nottingham said. "In a way the
church itself is on a search for spirituality. This search is key
to the church's revitalization."
      "Search of Spirituality" journeys across the country to
document the answers. In California, over 200 people representing
a wide range of faith groups celebrate new ways of worship through
creation-centered rituals. In Chicago, an African-American
Lutheran congregation gives witness to the power and joy of
communal spirituality. In Iowa, 5,000 Presbyterian women gather to
construct new images of God and the church. In New York, 100
Vietnam veterans convene for a retreat at the direction of
Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh to bind the wounds of war into
banners of inner and global peace.
      From gurus to grassroots, spirituality speaks to the seekers
who are redefining their lives under the rubric of personal
transformation and societal renewal. In the process, three central
questions emerge to prod the spiritual quest: Who am I? Who is my
neighbor? Who is God? The journey continues as the answers to each
of these questions unravel the harsh realities of individual lives
and interweaves the responses to form new images of self, neighbor
and God.
      "Search for Spirituality" was produced for the National
Council of Churches by Current Production Group. The
producer/director is John Ankele, and Mary Byrne Hoffman of the
National Council of Churches is the executive producer.

STATUS OF MISSIONARIES IN ZAIRE   91b-120

December 11, 1991
Contact: Clifford L. Willis
      INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (DNS) -- The status of nine Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ) missionaries previously stationed in
Zaire has been reevaluated in light of the deteriorating political
and economic situation in the Central African nation.
      Zaire's situation "appears to be moving beyond the critical
stage to chaos," said the Rev. Dan C. Hoffman, Africa executive
for the Disciples' overseas ministries division. "We cannot in
good conscience, leave our staff uncertain about their status and
the possibility of future service.
      "While we are concerned about the lives and ministries of
our overseas staff, we also care deeply about our brothers and
sisters in Zaire," Hoffman said. "We don't know what the future
will bring, but believe an already-difficult situation will
worsen. We ask North American Disciples to join us in prayer for
the church in Zaire as well as for the people."
      Beginning January 1, two missionaries will start terminal
home leave, five will be on home leave until new assignments
develop and two will maintain modified relationships with Zaire.
Those persons affected by the changes are:
      - Amy Hirsch, Tucson, Ariz., and Lois Hodrick, Oakland,
Calif., whose terms end June 30, 1992 and April 30, 1992, will
finish their terms here in the United States.
      - Saul and Maria Falcon will remain in Coronel Oviedo,
Paraguay, on home leave through June 30, 1992. The couple may
return to Zaire or be reassigned elsewhere in Africa, Latin
America or the Caribbean.
      - Daniel and Sandra Gourdet will be on home leave in
Birmingham, Ala., through August 31, 1992, while another
assignment is explored for them in another African nation.
      - Michael Allen, Erie, Pa., is now based in Brazzaville,
Congo, where he will attempt to relate to Zairian churches,
organizations and hospitals in Mbandaka.
      - Robert and Gertrud Muller will continue to be based in
Offerdingen, Germany. Robert Muller will make frequent trips to
the Church of Christ in Zaire's architectural office.
      These changes were approved in November by the Division of
Overseas Ministries board of directors.

[] MISSIONARIES TELL UNITED METHODIST MISSION BOARD OF THEIR WORK

20(10-21-71)                                        Jan. 16, 1992

Mission Interns Share Stories
with Board of Global Ministries


     NEW YORK (UMNS)--When Natasha Kanhai, a United Methodist from
Wisconsin, started working at a slum project in Bombay, India, she
felt frustrated by her lack of ability to communicate.

     The people of the slums spoke a wide variety of languages.
One day, on a field trip to a park, no one could translate.
     Then something happened.  By patching together different
languages, she managed to talk with four women resting in the
shade.  She learned, she said, "to communicate with the heart."

     Kanhai was one of 17 United Methodist mission interns who
shared their stories Jan. 16 at the United Methodist Board of
Global Ministries headquarters here.  Fourteen of them have
returned from 16-month foreign assignments and are starting U.S.
placements.  Three interns had taken a one-year foreign assignment.

     In Zimbabwe, Africa, Don Wilson of South Carolina learned the
"people's theology," which is, he explained, "when you're willing
to step into their situation and see the world from their point of
view," including other perspectives of God.

     Kai Jackson of Georgia, also assigned to Zimbabwe, witnessed
"the power of African women organizing for their own economic
independence."  Jackson's contribution included sponsoring a
doll-making workshop.

     Gina Chamberlain of Illinois turned the frightening experience
of being robbed of a gold cross necklace on the streets of Nairobi,
Kenya, into an examination of what action was being taken to help
the street children who robbed her.

     She realized that merely talking about issues or "going to a
seminar on the debt crisis or on street children didn't affect
those children at all."

     The Board of Global Ministries' three-year mission intern
program--for adults 22-30--combines work and study experiences with
the goals of community-building and cross-cultural interaction.
Participants bring back a new understanding of mission and the
search for justice and become resources for the church.

     Joanne Reich of Florida and Jane Eesley of Illinois, who were
both in Jerusalem, said they saw the everyday life of Palestinians
in a different way than that portrayed by U.S. media.

     Eesley also was concerned with the lack of U.S. Christian
attention to the Palestinians, some of whom are Christian.
"Tremendous numbers of Christians who visit the Holy Land," she
explained, make the trip to "visit stones, not people."

     In the same way, Elizabeth Dillard of Illinois and Allen
Vaughan of Missouri learned of internal refugees and human-rights
violations in the Philippines.

     And beyond the headlines of Eastern Europe, Lonnie Chafin of
Virginia worked at a center in Hungary housing 40 refugees--of
varying ethnic groups--from the war in Yugoslavia. "Instead of
(using) violence, they chose to be a community," he said.

     Carrie Lee of Washington and Pamila Lew of Ohio, assigned to
Korea, and Dinah Hall of California, who went to Japan, said they
came away more enlightened about the United States and those
countries and about the relationships between the countries.

     Holly Randolph of California, Maribel Mojica of Puerto Rico,
Marcia Chamberlain of Virginia and Bert Gardner of North Carolina
all spoke of what they learned from the poor in Latin America.

     Children in South Africa taught Laura Butterbaugh of Illinois
about faith.  She recounted a story about trying to work with a
family of 10 orphaned children--who had seen their parents
killed--and not finding anything to interest them again in life.
Singing Christian songs helped the children to revive with joy.

     "I realized how much strength they got from Jesus and Jesus'
teaching," she said.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF BEGINS A NEW YEAR

LWR BOARD REORGANIZING FOR A NEW YEAR             1/17/92

     At the January 13-14 meeting of the LWR board, elections were held.
Robert Marshall (ELCA) was re-elected as president, Will L. Herzfeld (ELCA)
as vice-president, Norman D. Sell (LCMS) as secretary, and Walter Jensen as
treasurer.  Charles Lutz (ELCA) and Will L. Herzfeld (ELCA) were re-elected
unanimously to their positions on the board.  The Reverend Richard L.
Krenzke (LCMS) was elected as a Director replacing Dr. Eugene Linse (LCMS)
upon Linse's retirement from the board, which was announced this week.

     The Reverend Krenzke comes to the LWR board with various talents.
Educated at the University of Chicago, School of Social Service
Administration and Concordia Theological Seminary from which he was
ordained into the ministry of LCMS, Krenzke has spent the subsequent years
working in ways that best utilize his combined talents.  Recently elected
executive director of the LCMS board for Social Ministry Services, Krenzke
will assume his position on the LWR board with an April orientation and
then a June board meeting and retreat to be held in Seattle, Washington.

     "The best pan-Lutheran agency in America" were the words Eugene W.
Linse (LCMS) used to describe LWR in his closing comments to the board upon
his retirement from that body.  Linse has served the board since December
1982 as one of the 4 LCMS representatives.  LWR is thankful for his service
and appreciated his guidance in establishing and monitoring LWR's adherence
to by-laws and policy.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF CALLS CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE PUZZLING

LWR RESPONDS TO NEW CHALLENGES                    1/17/92

  Lutheran World Relief executive director Dr. Norman E. Barth in his
annual report to the board described the whirlwind of events in Eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States and the subsequent public
response and relief efforts as "a puzzlement."  He said storage and
distribution of relief supplies are difficult, as is targeting the needy in
those areas.

      Cognizant of the priority on the "poorest of the poor" that LWR has
always upheld, a decision has been carefully made.  LWR's focus will not be
diminished but some response to the call for aid in Eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States will be initiated.  A $20,000 grant to
Lutheran World Federation (LWF) was announced by Barth informing the Board
that part of it has already been used to transport 20 tons of food and
clothes to Yugoslavia.  This represents an initial contribution to LWR's
recently established Eastern European Fund.  Individuals may contribute to
this fund.

      Barth also reported that the impact of the first peace in Ethiopia
and Eritrea in 30 years is widening but that much rehabilitative work
remains to be done in the area.  In the past year, LWR completed delivery
to Eritrea and Tigray of more than 150,000 MT of food provided by US A.I.D.
Approximately 800,000 people were sustained during 1991 with this food.
Through the Emergency Relief Desk in Ethiopia and its newly opened office
in Asmara, LWR will continue to monitor the rehabilitative work in this
area but will not be so deeply involved in food aid in the future.

     An LWR partner agency in Nicaragua heralded for its work on peace and
reconciliation, a focus of LWR's, was highlighted by Dr.  Barth.  CEPAD
(Evangelical Committee for Development in Nicaragua) has trained more than
50 local ecumenical peace missions.  Respected by both parties in the
conflict-ridden areas of Nicaragua, these missions are able to mediate
satisfactory resolutions, especially concerning land rights.

[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF ASSESSES USA GOVERNMENT ATTITUDES
TOWARDS NEEDS IN EASTERN EUROPE, HORN OF AFRICA; OTHER AREAS NOTED

LWR WASHINGTON STAFF TELL THE STORY               1/17/92

     U.S. government aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States has not
come at the expense of poorer countries, said Carol Capps, representative
for development policy for Church World Service and Witness/Lutheran World
Relief.  Ms. Capps, reporting to the board of directors of Lutheran World
Relief, said that while third world needs have never been a high priority
in Congress, the U.S. government appears to realize that the magnitude of
suffering in the republics of the former Soviet Union is on a different
scale than that in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.

     Ms. Capps also reported on U.S. policy toward the Horn of Africa,
noting that the international community appears paralyzed by the violence
in Somalia, which continues to destroy lives and property.  Governments and
humanitarian agencies have found it difficult to operate in the country, as
anarchy set in after the fall last year of President Siad Barre.  In
neighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. has been slow to provide development aid due
to overdue repayments on military loans dating to the time of Haile
Selassie, in the early 1970s.  Congressional action which would permit
development aid to the new government of Ethiopia failed when an overall
foreign aid bill was not passed in November.  The executive branch could
permit such development aid and is currently going through the steps
necessary to effect a waiver of the Congressional prohibition (Brooke
amendment) of such development aid.

     Ms. Capps introduced Paul Nelson who gave an update on U.S. policy
relating to African recovery and development.  Mr. Nelson and his wife
Paola Scommegna recently joined the Washington staff in policy analysis and
communications.

     In addition to the report from Ms. Capps, the board heard reports from:

     board member Bishop Harold Skillrud of Atlanta on his
     board- mandated monitoring trip to East Africa.
     Describing the "exquisite beauty, grinding poverty and
     concentrated joy" he found in Kenya, Tanzania and
     Zimbabwe, he commended the dedication of LWR staff and
     partners in working to ease human suffering.  In an
     accompanying slide show, Skillrud showed slides of a
     Tanzanian woman who, ten years ago, lived in a small
     home made of bark and thatch.  Thanks to a grant of an
     in-calf heifer, the woman has managed to raise a small
     herd of cattle, increasing the nutrition level of her
     family, and building a brick home with a tin roof.  She
     also has passed on the gift of her heifer to others so
     that they may benefit.

     board member Charles Lutz of Minneapolis.  Lutz
     reported on his trip to monitor LWR work in Israeli
     Occupied Territories, saying the Gaza Strip was "the
     most depressing place on earth, with a feeling of
     gloom."  With Israelis and Palestinians currently in
     negotiations, Lutz found guarded hope among Palestinian
     contacts for the prospects of peace.

     the president of the board.  Robert Marshall encouraged
     board members who are so inclined to write their
     representatives and urge them to make the 10 billion
     dollar loan guarantee that Israel is requesting
     contingent on certain criteria; namely, that there be a
     moratorium on all Israeli settlement-building, that the
     peace process not be disrupted and that human rights
     abuses be decreased.

     the board members on the Middle East.  A "sense of the
     board" was adopted without objection where by it was
     agreed that LWR would not join in any letter advocating
     the passage of the $10 billion loan guarantee to Israel
     without "iron-clad assurances of a freeze on all
     Israeli settlement-building in the occupied
     territories.

     LWR staff on its trial period of direct mail.  Working
     with representatives of the Lutheran Church-Missouri
     Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
     LWR has recently initiated a direct mail appeal program
     corresponding only with individuals who have given
     directly to LWR in the past.  To date, LWR has spent
     less than 8 cents to raise each dollar under the direct
     mail program.  With an overall response rate of 9.5%,
     LWR is encouraged by the results.

     Middle East and Asia Program Director.  In his
     presentation to the LWR board, the Reverend Gene
     Thiemann, donned a gas mask to make two points.  With a
     voice muffled by the mask, he talked first about the
     LWR funds that were used to purchase gas masks for the
     Augusta Victoria Hospital staff in Jerusalem when the
     Persian Gulf war raged. Second, Thiemann talked about
     the need to really listen to the voices that get
     muffled by warfare, natural disaster and civil strife.
     He challenged LWR to amplify and clarify the voices of
     the poor.
