Brazil Launches New Approach To Protect Rain Forests
</H2></CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH=450><TD>MANAUS, Brazil – An innovative rain forest conservation approach that focuses on large corridors of forest could ultimately protect more than 75 percent of Brazil's tropical  biodiversity in just 20 percent of its land area.
<P>
In two recent meetings, Brazilian scientists and conservationists, along with a number of international experts and donor agencies, designed two major conservation corridors for the Central Brazilian Amazon and Brazil's central Atlantic forest. 
<P>
"Corridor conservation solves the dilemma of habitat fragmentation, and its critical, adverse impact on evolution and ultimately on species survival," said Dr. Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, who attended the meetings in Brazil.  "The reality is that many parks and other protected areas have become isolated islands in an ocean of agricultural land or entirely degraded areas."
<P>
"This approach targets investments to priority areas, or corridors, instead of spreading relatively small amounts of money in the hundreds of areas decreed as protected areas,"  noted Dr. Gustavo Fonseca, vice president for <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/brazreg.htm">Conservation International's Brazil Program</A>.  "The continuity aspect of the corridors is extremely important, allowing gene flow between the parks and reserves, increasing the likelihood of survival of the most extinction-prone species."
<P>
In a preliminary study, seven major corridors were identified, five in the <B>Brazilian Amazon</B> and two in <B>Brazil's Atlantic Forest</B>, totaling 500,000 kilometers, or an area equivalent in size to Spain.  Combined, the conservation of these corridors would ensure protection of more than 75 percent of Brazil's tropical forest biodiversity in 20 percent of the country's land area.   Some $36 million is designated for the project through a <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org" TARGET="main">World Bank</A> pilot program, with Germany and the European Union the principle financial supporters.  
<P>
The Atlantic Forest site focuses on that region's highest level of biodiversity in a corridor 
which covers 64,000 kilometers and includes eight federal Environment Protection Areas, 
<P>



12 federal parks and reserves, four agricultural field stations, four major forest tracts belonging to cellulose production companies, 11 indigenous reserves and several privately protected areas, known in Brazil as <B>Natural Heritage Private Reserves</B>.  The total area occupied by these protected forests totals 4,000 kilometers, or close to 60 percent of the remaining continuous habitat in this highly devastated region of the Atlantic forest.
<P>
Brazil's Atlantic forest region is generally considered one of the four or five highest priority threatened <A HREF="../../fieldact/hotspots/hotspots.htm">"hotspots"</A> for terrestrial biodiversity on Earth, along with <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/madagasc.htm">Madagascar</A>, the <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/philippi.htm">Philippines</A> and the <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/ttareg.htm">Tropical Andes</A>.  It once covered about 2 million kilometers, or an area about three times the size of the state of California.  However, it was the first region of Brazil to be colonized, and was developed into the agriculture and industrial center of the country.  Today it has among the highest human populations in the Western Hemisphere, including both Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the second largest city in the world.  Only about 2 to 5 percent of the original habitat remains intact.
<P>
The Atlantic forest claims 620 species of birds and 20,000 species of plants (half of them endemic) – numbers that rival the total diversity of the United States. The region has a high concentration of endangered  species, including the colorful lion tamarins and the largest of the New World primates, the muriqui.   Brazil is home to the highest totals of terrestrial and freshwater diversity on Earth as well as more than one third of all tropical rain forests.  It holds several biodiversity world records, including 55,000 plant species,  524 mammal species, 76 primate species and 70 parrot and macaw species.  Conservation of Brazil's magnificent and globally important biodiversity, particularly in the Amazon rain forest, has been a global concern for decades. Brazil's high profile has catalyzed worldwide concern for tropical forests.
<P>
Implementation of the corridor concept will involve Brazil's federal and state government, local and international non-governmental groups, indigenous groups and the private sector. A management body currently being discussed to oversee the corridors is a non-governmental foundation that would include stakeholders from all sectors.  The role of the private sector will be particularly important, since it holds some of the largest remaining tracts of land in the Atlantic forest corridors.  There is an increasing common interest between the conservation community and some of the most important industries in this region of Brazil, in particular the rapidly growing ecotourism industry.
<P>
"The central corridor of the Atlantic forest combines tropical reef, rain forest and beach in a way that few places in the world can match," noted Mittermeier.  "Another example of such reef-rain forest interface and its great appeal is Australia's north Queensland, where the ecotourism industry is well developed."</TD></TABLE></CENTER>
