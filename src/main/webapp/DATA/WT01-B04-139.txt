<H2><CENTER>Dangerous side effects of cocaine are amplified when used in
conjunction with marijuana </CENTER>
</H2>
Drug-using volunteers were used in a study to determine the effect that
marijuana smoking had on their subsequent use of cocaine. Lukas and colleagues
(Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, Vol 48:715721, 1994). The study
found that the increase in heart rate due to cocaine was markedly enhanced
if preceded by smoking marijuana, and that the time to the cocaine high
was reduced from two minutes to one minute. Most importantly there was double
the amount of drug absorption evident when marijuana use preceded cocaine
use. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> Many drug users use two or more drugs at the
same time. In analyses of polydrug use, marijuana is the most heavily used
illicit drug. Because it enhances the cocaine experience, it is commonly
used in combination with this drug. <BR>
<BR>
People snorting cocaine after smoking marijuana are at greater risk of overdose
and more severe cardiovascular effects from the cocaine. Variability in
the nasal effects of both drugs makes dosing unpredictable and dangerous.

<H2><CENTER>Study on use of THC to treat HlV-wasting syndrome shows no weight
gain. </CENTER>
</H2>
A review of the current treatment for the HIV-wasting syndrome reported
on studies with dronabinol, which has an approved use for anorexia in AIDS
patients. Schroeder, Hart, and Lynch (Annals of Pharmacotherapy, Vol 28:595-597,
1993). Dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana,
was approved by the FDA based on a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical
trial involving 139 AIDS patients in 18 centers. <BR>
<BR>
Patients with a five-pound weight loss, no active infection, and no marijuana
use for 30 days were included in the study. Dronabinol was given in a dose
of 2.5 mg orally twice a day to the treatment group with a placebo control
group. Patients reported an increase in appetite after six weeks of therapy.
However, there was less than a half-pound weight gain in treated patients
which was not statistically different from the one-pound weight loss in
the placebo group at the end of the six week period. <BR>
<BR>
The authors conclude that the efficacy of dronabinol in reversing the wasting
process associated with AIDS is yet to be determined, and that the subjective
increase in appetite did not necessarily correspond to increased body weight.
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> AIDS wasting is a devastating complication
of infection with the AIDS virus. The drug megestrol has been recently approved
by the FDA and is far more effective than dronabinol in the studies to date.
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, no scientific studies have confirmed a benefit of the use of crude
marijuana on HlV-wasting syndrome. Additionally, for the AIDS patient, smoking
a substance with fungal and bacterial contamination, as well as the inherent
damage by the smoke to lungs already predisposed to infection, would be
counterproductive. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Review of anti-nausea drugs show restricted use for synthetic
cannabinoids </CENTER>
</H2>
Grunder and Hesketh (New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 329:1790-1795,
1993) recently reviewed current therapies for chemotherapy-induced vomiting
control. The authors discuss the vomiting response and the neural pathways
involved in mediating that response. Regarding the use of cannabinoids,
the authors state that dronabinol and nabilone, the two cannabinoids that
have been evaluated most thoroughly, are active only in patients receiving
mild, not severely, emetogenic chemotherapy. <BR>
<BR>
The authors state that these drugs have serious side effects, however, including
dysphoria, vertigo, hallucinations, sedation, and disorientation, and are
seldom selected as first-line anti-emetic therapy. They point out that while
these drugs have limited usage, some synthetic cannabinoids with no psychotropic
activity have anti-emetic properties, suggesting that there are separate
sites of action for the anti-vomiting and the psychotropic activity. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> With the availability of newer anti-emetic
drugs which are more potent, more effective and have less side effects in
reversing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, the use of drugs
with major side effects should be avoided. <BR>
<BR>
One common assumption about taking anti-emetics orally is that the patients
are already vomiting and cannot keep the medication down. However, all anti-emetic
therapy is given prior to administration of chemotherapy drugs, before the
onset of nausea and vomiting. Further, if the need for additional anti-emetic
medication were indicated it could be administered in suppository form.

<H2><CENTER>Study looks at immunologic impact of tobacco and marijuana smoke
on the lungs </CENTER>
</H2>
Wallace and associates, in Chest, Vol. 105:847-852, studied the effect of
heavy, habitual marijuana use and compared it with tobacco smoking on the
composition of cells in the peripheral blood and small airways of the lung.
<BR>
<BR>
Cell samples from 14 non-smokers were compared to samples from 14 tobacco
smokers, 19 heavy habitual marijuana smokers, and 9 patients who smoked
both substances. The tobacco smokers had lower percentages of cells in their
small airways that had the marker for the CD4 or helper T-cells. Marijuana
use had the opposite effect of lowering the CD8 positive cells, so-called
suppressor cells, at the expense of CD4 cells. The authors concluded that
tobacco and marijuana have effects on immune cells and blood lymphocyte
populations that differ from each other, both in type and magnitude. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> These data are further examples of information
from the group of Tashkin et al which show the effects of tobacco and marijuana
smoke on the intrinsic cells in the lung and the immunologic defenses of
the lungs. A combination of tobacco and marijuana would be devastating in
terms of exposure of patients to carcinogens, and also in damaging the immune
response to foreign particles, bacteria, and viruses. Immunologic alterations
that were observed in the study were of potential importance because they
correlated with the adverse health effects of smoking either substance,
alone or in combination. <BR>
