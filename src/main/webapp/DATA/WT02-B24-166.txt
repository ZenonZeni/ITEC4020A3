<P>To:  Miles Turner, Executive Director</P>
<P>  Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators</P>
<P>From: William E. McCardell</P>
<P>Date:  July 26, 1995</P>
<P><B>Re:  Changes in Law Regarding Administrators' Contracts</B></P>
<P>You have requested our opinion regarding certain issues which arise with respect to administrators' contracts entered into on or after today's date, pursuant to 1995 Wisconsin Act 27 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which the Governor signed this morning.  Contracts entered into prior to today's date are not subject to the provisions of the Act, and are not addressed herein.</P>
<P>You have posed the following question to us:</P>
<P>&quot;May school boards offer administrators contracts obligating the parties to each other for more than two years?&quot;</P>
<P>The Act describes the time periods of administrators' contracts as follows:</P>
<P>118.24(1): A school board may employ a school district administrator, a business manager, and school principals and assistants to such persons.  The term of each employment contract may not exceed two years.  A contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each.</P>
<P>118.24(8): Personnel administrators and supervisors, curriculum administrators  and assistants to such administrative personnel, when employed by the school board of any school district to perform administrative duties only, may be employed for a term that does not exceed two years.  A contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each. . . .</P>
<P>It is clear that administrators covered under sections 118.24 (1) and 118.24  (8) must have employment contracts, whose terms may not exceed two years. However, any contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each.  I construe such language to mean that those contracts having terms of two years may indeed be extended in increments of one year each, thereby obligating each party to such contracts for the duration of the two-year term and any oneyear extensions to the contracts.  Although the term of the contracts may not exceed two years, the one-year extensions can automaticallyand continuously roll year after year.</P>
<P>Please note that there are no qualifications or limitations on the number of successive contract extensions which may be entered into by the parties.  When the parties enter into a twoyear contract, successive extensions may be part and parcel of the original contract.  Additionally, such extensions may be entered into at any time during the pendency of the two-year contract.</P>
<P>Indeed, since the Act does not limit the number of two-year contracts a school board and administrator can enter into, one can legitimately argue that school boards may offer an administrator multiple twoyear contracts or one contract for a term of two years with multiple oneyear extensions.  In any event, the parties will be obligated to each other for the duration of the original contract and any other contracts or extensions entered into by the parties.</P>
<P>We have discussed these issues with numerous individuals directly involved in the legislative process and the drafting of the statutory language.  It is quite clear that a majority of the individuals believe that since a school board can enter into successive two-year contracts, it can enter into contracts for a term of two years, whose terms also include automatic extensions of one or more years.</P>
<P>This opinion is an initial analysis of the law, and is provided without the benefit of any court or state agency interpretation.  If and when such interpretations become available, all parties must carefully analyze the law in light of such interpretations. Finally, all parties should be aware that any changes made in administrator contracts should be reviewed by legal counsel in conjunction with applicable Board policies and individual administrators' employment contracts.</P>
