Dear Reader:<P>
<P>
The cover story in the last issue of the OCRWM Bulletin announced that OCRWM had received
only half its fiscal year 1996 budget request. Despite the major reduction in resources, I am
pleased to report that management improvements and programmatic efficiencies initiated under
our original Program Plan, and continued and enhanced under our recently revised Program Plan,
have enabled us to make significant progress in advancing our mission of managing and
disposing of the Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.<P>
<P>
The fiscal year 1997 Congressional appropriation supports the approach outlined in our revised
plan <a href="01entprs.htm">(see related article)</a>. The appropriated $382 million will allow us to complete
the 5-mile exploratory tunnel and the construction of all major underground test alcoves in FY
1997. We will continue to narrow the range of unresolved scientific and engineering issues. The
direction we are taking will, by 1998, enable us to complete a viability assessment of the Yucca
Mountain site. With continued adequate funding and an updated regulatory process, we can
regain a target date of 2002 for the submittal of a competent license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.<P>
<P>
In accordance with the Secretary's objectives for re-engineering the Department and greater
privatization, and consistent with the direction of the policy debate taking place in the Congress,
we have also revised our program approach for waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
activities. We will place greater reliance upon the marketplace and utilize appropriately
structured contractual arrangements to acquire the needed technologies and the logistical
capability to carry out these responsibilities. (For more information on these activities, see Pre-solicitation Conference for Acquisition of Transportation Services Held in Washington and
Working Group Meets to Discuss Transportation Issues in this issue.)<P>
<P>
We continue to carry out contingency planning to address the challenges inherent in the
transportation and interim storage of commercial spent nuclear fuel. As the funding levels for
future years are defined, and as Congress provides new policy direction, we will further refine the
Program. <P>
<P>
Ours is a challenging and exciting enterprise. Thus, we have renamed our newsletter The
OCRWM Enterprise to reflect the difficult, risky, and complex nature of our program. I hope that
you will find our newly designed semiannual newsletter to be useful and informative.<P>
<P>
