<title> Master of Engineering (M.Eng.)</title>
<h1> Master of Engineering (M.Eng.)</h1>

The intent of the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) 
program is to prepare graduate engineers for advanced 
professional practice.  This is accomplished through 
completion of graduate level courses, although many 
students include a project in their program.  The M.Eng. 
program is primarily taken on a part-time basis by 
practicing engineers.<p>
The M.Eng. program requires successful completion of at 
least ten half-courses (with a plurality of mechanical and 
industrial engineering courses) at the graduate level.  
Composition of the course program must be selected in 
cooperation with the student's academic supervisor. A 
Project Report will be accepted in lieu of three half-
courses.<p>
Although M.Eng. degree holders are not normally 
expected to enter a Ph.D. program, they are not barred 
from doing so. M.Eng. students who might eventually 
wish to engage in a Ph.D. program should complete a 3-
credit Project Report designed to demonstrate their 
research abilities, and should include at least two Ph.D. 
core courses in their program of study.
