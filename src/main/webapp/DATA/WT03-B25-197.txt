<P><B>Introduction<BR>

</B><BR>

A deployment in 1996 of the NASA AIRSAR/TOPSAR instrument to the Asia-Australian

region and the Pacific has the potential to contribute significantly to

the current understanding of many aspects of earth system science. The application

of radar polarimetry and high precision digital elevation data is currently

in its infancy. The proposed mission will not only build on the scientific

objectives and benefits of the 1993 Australian Mission, but will be expanded

to include specific SAR science issues best addressed in countries and regions

in south-east Asia. It is anticipated that the Asia-Australia deployment

will enable the baseline characterisation of control sites in many different

environments for the continued analysis of earth surface, climatic and tectonic

processes into the period when operational datasets become available from

satellite or airborne systems.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

The proposed deployment will involve numerous sites and a large number of

investigator from Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia,

Philippines and Japan.<BR>

<B>Background<BR>

</B><BR>

The Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) was developed at the Jet

Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California and is the world's most advanced

synthetic aperture radar system. The AIRSAR system, flown in a DC-8 aircraft

operates in a full polarimetric mode at L-band (24cm), C-band (5.6 cm) and

P-band (68 cm). In addition to the three-frequency polarimetric capability,

the incorporation of additional C- and L-band antennas on the aircraft permits

along-track interferometry at these frequencies resulting in the production

of TOPSAR digital elevation models.<BR>

<BR>

Data is digitally encoded and recorded using onboard high density digital

tape recorders and later processed into images.<BR>

<BR>

THE PACIFIC RIM DEPLOYMENT provides a unique opportunity to acquire data

over land and water surfaces not previously available. The potential for

AIRSAR/TOPSAR includes:<BR>

<BR>

geologic studies embracing geomorphic studies, rock weathering and erosional

processes, tectonics and geologic boundaries, geobotany, radar stereogrammetry,

DEM and interferometry.<BR>

<BR>

hydrological investigations which cover wetland, humid and arid environment

characterisation, and in particular, the assessment of soil moisture conditions.<BR>

<BR>

mapping and identifying vegetation types, assessing the biophysical properties

of plant canopies, modelling tree morphologies and examining soil-vegetation

boundary layer.<BR>

<BR>

oceanographic studies to analyse ocean wave spectra, internal wave-current

interaction and detection of current-system boundaries, oceanic fronts and

mesoscale eddies.<BR>

<LI>Imaging radar is an all-weather imaging tool. 

<LI>AIRSAR's multiple capabilities -- polarimetry, interferometry, multifrequency

- have widened the range of applications for imaging radar measurements.

<LI>Multi-frequency radar images can classify a vegetation cover more easily

than single-frequency radar images. 

<LI>Soil moisture level (top few cm) and canopy water content can be estimated

from polarimetry data. 

<LI>Radar backscatter measurements can be related to biomass (up to ~200

tonnes/hectare) with accuracy within 20% of absolute biomass. 

<LI>AIRSAR<B> </B>can penetrate vegetation canopies, revealing inundation.

<LI>AIRSAR can penetrate dry soil, revealing buried structures. 

<LI>AIRSAR' interferometry mode produces high-resolution (2 - 5 m) topographic

map. 

<LI>By combining polarinietry data and interferometry data, one can estimate

tree heights and the underlying surface topography. 

<LI>Correlation data from TOPSAR mode can be used for land classification.

<LI>Along-track interferometry can measure current velocity in the radar

line-of-sight direction.
