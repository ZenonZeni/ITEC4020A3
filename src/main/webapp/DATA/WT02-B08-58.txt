Notes on Aloe Vera



by Peter T. Pugliese, MD<br>

Biomedical Consultant<br>

Bernivlle, Pa <br>

July 28,1994<p>



Aloe vera has many positive properties.  The anti-inflammatory action of aloe vera provides versatility  to other formulations when compounded with aloe vera.  When used with cellulite reduction products containing theophylline aloe vera has the unique action increasing lymphatic drainage and promoting an accelerated action of the theophylline.<p>



Fat cells in cellulite are characterized by a subclinical inflammatory state.  Subclinical inflammation is not detectable by visual means as it is microscopic.  In the presence of this low grade inflammation the fat cells are swollen and under increased interstitial (intercellular) pressure.  This increased pressure reduces the flow of lymph fluid which in turn causes a slowing of the theophylline to the fat cell.  Addition of aloe to the products reduces the inflammation which reduces the intercellular pressure on the lymphatic vessels, allowing them to carry away more lymph fluid, including free fatty acids which are breakdown products of lipid metabolism.<p>



This added benefit of aloe vera to the formula will provide a greater benefit from using anti-cellulite products.  When combined with a regimen of walking the benefit is even greater.<p>
