<h3>The Sinful Six</h3>
<p>
<i>By Cyndi Jones, Publisher</i>
<p>
Six major corporations redefined the meaning of mean-spirited
behavior this year. VISA, McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch, Sara Lee,
Bausch and Lomb, and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance decided not
to sponsor the Paralympics. That was regretable. But these
corporations -- which were sponsors of the Olympics -- went too
far. These Sinful Six companies refused to release their
categories, thus prohibiting the Paralympics from soliciting their
competitors. That meant that companies like American Express,
Burger King, or Miller's could not be approached for sponsorship.
<p>
The Sinful Six obviously believed that we don't have money to spend
or available credit, so we don't matter to them. After all it was 
only the Paralympics. 
<p>
As Olympic sponsors these corporations had the right to retain
their category and withhold their sponsorship of the Paralympics. 
<p>
Well, the disability community has the right to withhold spending 
money with these companies. That is exactly what Alana Shepherd of 
Shepherd Center, a founding sponsor of the Paralympics, is asking 
the disability community and our friends to do. We are calling for 
a boycott of the Sinful Six.
<p>
"You're no BUD of mine!" "A BIG MAC is not on my diet!" "Who is
Sara Lee, anyway?" I'm sure that many of you can come 
up with creative slogans, and I urge you to forward them our way. 
If you are online send them to publisher@mainstream-mag.com or you 
can send them to our street address.
<p>
Let these companies know what you think of their shameful treatment
of the Paralympics.

<p>
What do we want from these corporations? Here are the demands
formulated by the disability community in Atlanta:
<p>
1) Work with the National Council on Independent Living to evaluate
their corporate giving programs to determine if they empower people
with disabilities.
<p>
2) Become founding sponsors of the U.S. Disabled Athletes Fund by 
the end of 1996.
<p>
3) Become sponsors of the Paralympic Games in 2000 by July 26,
1997.
<p>
4) Provide staffing assistance and at least $100,000 each for a
worldwide celebration of disability rights, including a 10th
Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act celebration
event in the year 2000.
