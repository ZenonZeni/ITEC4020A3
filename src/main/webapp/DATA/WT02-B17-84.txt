     In 1990, Dr. Henry R. Linden was named Max McGraw Professor of 
Energy and

Power Engineering and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology 
(IIT), where

he has been a faculty member since 1954.  Seven years earlier, in 1947, 
he began his

long association with an IIT affiliate, the Institute of Gas Technology.  
He served as

IGT's president and trustee for four years.  In 1965, he organized IGT's 
wholly owned

subsidiary, Gas Developments Corporation, now known as GDC, Inc.
<p>

     Dr. Linden was also instrumental in forming the Gas Research 
Institute (GRI),

the cooperative research and development arm of the U.S. gas industry.  
He was

elected as GRI's first president, and named a member of its board of 
directors, in 1977,

and he retired from the presidency of that organization in 1987.

     In addition to these activities and his work on the Hydrogen 
Technical Advisory

Panel, Dr. Linden serves on the boards of the AES Corporation, Resources 
for the

Future, Inc., and Centennial Holdings, Inc.  He recently retired from 
the boards of

Reynolds Metals Co., UGI Corporation, Sonat, Inc., and Southern Natural 
Gas

Company after many years of service.  He has also served on the advisory 
council of

the Electric Power Research Institute and the Energy Engineering Board 
of the National

Research Council.

Dr. Linden began his distinguished career in the energy field at Mobil 
Oil

Corporation in New York in the 1940s.  He received his doctorate in 
chemical

engineering from IIT in 1952.
