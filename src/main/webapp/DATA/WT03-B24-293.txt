<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>What is the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association ?</B></FONT>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> The Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, or NCIBA, is a trade organization dedicated to supporting, nurturing and promoting independent retail bookselling. With hundreds of member stores in just about every community in Northern California (from Arcata in the north to Monterey in the South), the NCIBA has been an experienced provider of services for over two decades.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>What kind of bookstores are independent bookstores ?</B></FONT>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> All kinds ! Our diversity is our strength. Our membership includes general interest bookstores as well as specialty shops. Children's, travel, mystery, science fiction, antiquarian, used and even museum bookstores belong to the NCIBA. Some stores are as small as 100 square feet, some as large as 33,000 square feet. What matters is not the size of the store or the volume of business, but our dedication to quality service, community involvement and most importantly - books.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>"Independent" seems to be a defining characteristic of your organization. What's the difference between an independent bookstore and a chain bookstore ?</B></FONT>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Have you ever walked into a chain bookstore and asked for the Pulitzer Prize winning novel <B>Shipping News</B>, and been told they don't carry that <I>magazine</I>. Or have you asked for <B>Lolita</B>, and been refered to the Amy Fischer story ? 

<P>As more and more people are discovering, the so-called "super" stores are not really all that "super." In fact, many of the leading chain bookstores have begun to model their business operations after independent stores. However, without the dedication of knowledgeable and experienced employees, of community involvement and responsiveness, and of our own love of books and enthuisiasm for sharing our passion - chain bookstores are not all they appear to be. Independent bookstores stand for something different - and we believe, something better.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>What exactly does the NCIBA do ? </B></FONT>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Among our many projects is the <B>California Catalog</B>, a holiday catalog distributed throughout California. The books appearing in this catalog are the result of the NCIBA's best efforts in soliciting titles of interest to customers of independent bookstores. With its 1.5 million print run, full color format and popularity with consumers, the <B>California Catalog</B> has proven to be the leading holiday book catalog in the state.

<P>One recent project is<B> First and Foremost: A Guide to Northern California Independent Bookstores</B>. This comprehensive guide - co-published with Heydey Books - is essential reading for any book or bookstore lover. Another recent project includes five regional directories to independent bookstores throughout Northern California. These full color brochures feature maps and a listing of the best bookstores throughout the East Bay, San Francisco, North Bay & North Coast, South Bay & South Coast, and the Central Valley, Gold Country and Sierras. These brochures can be found in bookstores, hotel lobbies, chambers of commerce, bed & breakfasts and other high traffic locations throughout the region.

<P>Each month, the NCIBA issues a regional best-seller list published in alternative newspapers such as the <I>East Bay Express</I> and the <I>Sacramento News & Review</I>. This list differs from other bestseller lists and reflects what is really selling in independent bookstores in Northern California. The NCIBA is also the source of the popular " <B><A HREF="goodread.html">Good Reads</a></B>" ads found in the<B> San Francisco Chronicle</B> and elsewhere. These ads feature bookseller reviews of distinctive titles - the kind we love to tell our customers about. Adjunct to the "Good Reads" campaign is the "Great Reads Book Award," which honors exceptional books and is voted upon annually by member bookstores.

<P>Besides these activities, the NCIBA also sponsors an annual trade show and educational workshops as well as producing a monthly newsletter and a California rep directory geared toward those in the retail bookselling community.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Can I join the NCIBA ?</B></FONT>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Membership is limited to those "in the trade." Regular membership is open to any individual member of the retail bookselling community whose primary place of business is California. We also welcome associate members, who while not entitled to vote, are vital to our community and its dialogue and receive all other benefits of membership. Associate members may include prospective booksellers, publishers, sales reps, wholesalers, members of the media, librarians, authors or illustrators and sideline/service/supply vendors. For more information about joining the NCIBA, please contact our office at 5643 Paradise Dr. Suite 12, Corte Madera, California 94925 or call 415-927-3971. We may be reached by email at <B> <A
