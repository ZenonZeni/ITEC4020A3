<h2><B>Competitive skills base</B></h2>
<P>
A competitive, highly skilled workforce is critical to the success
of most companies.
<P>
In advanced manufacturing, high-technology and international service
industries, victoria's skilled professionals, managers and technically
skilled workforce offer very good value.
<P>
All the professional services required by major businesses, such
as accounting, legal, banking, management consulting, staff recruitment,
engineering and marketing are found in Melbourne, to the highest
international standard.
<P>
Salaries for professionals and managers are much lower than in
most other locations surveyed in the Advantage Melbourne study.
<P>
The following tables demonstrate how competitive Melbourne is.
<P>
<I><B>Table 1 shows that salaries paid in Melbourne are lower
than in most countries surveyed: 17% lower than Sydney, 16% lower
than Singapore, and 17% lower than Stuttgart.</B></I>

Shimadzu Australia Manufacturing P/L
<br>
Shimadzu Corporation is a world leader in the manufacture of scientific
and medical instruments with a turnover in excess of $US1.3 billion.
<P>
Its move to Melbourne is the first time in the company's 120-year
history that it has located a wholly-owned manufacturing plant
outside Japan. Shimadzu demonstrates considerable confidence in
Victoria's suitability as a location for knowledge-based businesses.
<P>
The company began manufacturing at its plant in Melbourne in May
1995. Eleven assembly lines produce gas chromatographs, medical
X-ray systems and 25 other types of machines.
<P>
The company is already expanding  its operation in Melbourne with
a new plant, adjacent to the current  facility, to come on line
in 1996.
<P>
With the new plant in 1996, Shimadzu will be able to produce 56
types of precision machinery on a total of 33 lines. 
<P>
Nearly 100% of production is exported, with 50-75% of its componenets
sourced from Australian companies.
<P>
Shimadzu chose Victoria over alternative Asian locations because
of the State's greater availability of skilled labour, a vital
element for making precision- measuring equipment, and the ready
availability of local materials and components.
