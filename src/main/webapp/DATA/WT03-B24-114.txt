<li>Community ConneXion, founded in June of 1994, is the leading provider
of privacy on the Internet. They provide anonymous and pseudonymous
Internet access and web pages in addition to powerful web service,
virtual hosts, and web design consultation.  Information is available

Cheaper still (and more compatible with GUI newsreaders) try AltNet:
<pre>
   > telnet news.alt.net nntp
   Trying 204.137.156.2...
   Connected to tofu.alt.net.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   200 Mail <a href="mailto:info@alt.net">info@alt.net</a> for info about $5/month NNTP access (posting ok).
</pre>

If you can't afford $5/month, you can't afford Compu$erve.

<h3>Instructions on getting arround UseNet "censorship" attempts</h3>

From: Duncan Frissell <frissell@panix.com> <br>

Subject: Compuserve *hasn't* banned newsgroups<br>
<p>
So I'd heard that CompuServe had banned access to all those naughty
newsgroups including my favorite alt.binaries.erotic.senior-citizens.  Could
this be true?  I fired up my CompuServe Internet Dialer (the PPP software
packaged with WinCim and logged on to the nets.  Sure enough.  The popular
binaries groups were missing from news.compuserve.com.  But not to be
deterred...
<p>
I grabbed a copy of the Free Agent newsreader available at:
<br>
<a href="http://www2.interpath.net/forte/agent/freagent.htm">
http://www2.interpath.net/forte/agent/freagent.htm</a>
<br>
or
<br>
<a href="ftp.forteinc.com/pub/free_agent/fagent10.zip">
ftp.forteinc.com/pub/free_agent/fagent10.zip</a>
<p>
I grabbed the latest list of open NNTP Servers from:
<br>
<a href="http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~jwa/open-sites.html">
http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~jwa/open-sites.html</a>
<p>
I pointed my copy of Free Agent at CPCNET's open news server (198.70.185.5)
and grabbed a list of groups sure enough, there were the seasoned citizens
in all their glory.  And I was checking out those binaries via CompuServe.
<p>
Don't tell the Bavarians.
