COMMISSION TO DECIDE ON NEW YORK PETITION ON PLAYGROUNDS

Deciding whether to deny a petition from the New York City Dept. of Consumer
Affairs for a mandatory standard on home playground equipment will be on the
CPSC commissioners' agenda for January 1996.  The commissioners will receive
agency staff recommendations on the petition suggestions that go beyond ASTM
standards.

Though there have been no injuries or deaths, the department wants to impose
its own standards that include requirements for handrails, surfacing, and
prohibiting more than one activity on the same playground apparatus.  The
department based its recommendations on a survey it conducted.  ASTM Chair
for Home Playground Equipment Terri Hendy told PSL she is not sure whether
the commissioners will go ahead with the New York petition and said her group
has been working on revising ASTM standards.

While ASTM standards require home playground sets to not be placed on con-
crete, asphalt or grass, 1996 revisions will go the extra mile by listing
acceptable surfaces such as 8-10 inches of pea gravel, sand or wood mulch.
Also, home daycare centers with 10 children or fewer will have to comply with
ASTM home playground equipment standards.
Hendy said the current standard does not address small home daycare centers.

Other standard modifications the group wants to beef up are guardrails for
elevated platforms, determining the level of force that can be sustained by a
head when a multiple occupancy swing strikes it, and swing set packaging
stating if anchoring is required and if an anchoring set is included.

CRACKING BIKE FRAMES LED TO BROKEN BONES AND RECALL

Mountain bicycle frames that can fracture in the front at the headlug led to
injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones and a recall.  Riders
are in danger of being thrown from the bike and can get injured or killed.

Raleigh is recalling 300 Technium MT 400 and 24 Technium FT 500 bicycle
frames that measure 16.5 inches from the center of the bottom of the frame to
the seat.  Bike shops and authorized Raleigh dealers sold the bicycles
nationwide from January 1993 through December 1993 for $500 to $700.  Raleigh
spokesman Pat McVey told PSL the firm initiated its own recall in May 1995
and contacted CPSC "in order to increase publicity."  CPSC compliance staffer
David Schmeltzer said firms are required under Section 15 of the Consumer
Product Safety Act to report faulty products and injuries to the agency.

Cracking mountain bicycle frames were also a problem for Cannondale, which
put stickers on all 1995 Cannondales reminding consumers to inspect their
bike frames for cracks (PSL, 1/30).  Schmeltzer said CPSC and other bike
firms have recalled bicycles for defective handlebars, suspension forks and
brakes.

Cosmic brand bicycle wheels made for road bikes by Mavic, S.A. of France and
its distribution facility in West Chester, Penn., were subjected to a Dec. 21
recall.  The firm discovered the front wheel hub may fracture and cause the
spokes to come loose resulting in the driver losing control.  Though there
were no injuries reported, Cosmic Marketing Manager Chris Zigmont said the
recall was necessary.

CPSC will continue examining generic problems of hybrid and mountain bikes.
"We are concerned," Schmeltzer said, adding the agency is trying to figure
out why there have been problems with hybrid and mountain bikes.  Schmeltzer
told PSL it could be due to the kind of use the bike is subjected to or that
they are not designed to withstand abuse.

BREAKING OFF SMALL PARTS ON TOY TRUCK LEAD TO RECALL

Toy truck's driver and wheels that can break off and present choking hazard
to young children have led to the recall of 44,000 wooden toy trucks from
Division Sales of Itasca, Ill.  A spokesman told PSL the company received a
letter from customs stating the problems were discovered during a routine
exam of imported goods.

The firm will not be purchasing any more trucks from the manufacturing
company in China and will destroy any trucks it does have.  Posters in stores
will warn consumers of the potential danger.  The trucks were sold nationwide
in 86 retail and dollar stores for $1 each from December 1993 through
December 1995.

The trucks measure 5 inches long by 2 inches wide and are packaged with a
small wooden driver figure in a blue cardboard box labeled "Wood
toy...engineering truck educational toy" and were sold in six different
styles:

** two styles of dump trucks
** cement truck
** truck with a large, wooden, rotating cylinder
** truck with crane
** truck with ladder

The spokesman said there have been no consumer complaints and "other nations
with less strict standards than the U.S. may still have these toy trucks on
their shelves."  Consumers will receive a full refund upon returning the
truck.

CPSC TO RECEIVE DATA ON BATTERY ONCE DEEMED FLAWED

CPSCers will be updated on a lithium battery that once suffered from
performance problems relating to shelf life and field failure, now addressed
by Ultralife of Newark, N.Y.  An Ultralife spokesman told PSL the firm plans
on talking to CPSC because "the battery has been getting so much attention."

The U9VL Lithium Battery has a shelf life of 10 years and is for commercial
and consumer use such as electronic parking meters, wireless security
systems, portable blood analyzers, ambulatory fuse pumps, remote controls,
digital thermometers, garage door openers, clock radios and smoke detectors.
The battery meets all UL safety requirements, carries the UL component
recognition mark and meets ANSI dimensional standards.

Ultralife promotes the battery as being able to handle extreme temperatures
better than any other 9-volt battery from -40xF to 140xF.  CPSCer Jim Hoebel
said Ultralife is the first battery company to seek CPSC's feedback about a
new battery and called it a "breakthrough product."

CARPET IRRITANT VERIFICATION SOUGHT VIA MOUSE STUDIES

CPSC has identified some 100 chemicals emitted by carpets and carpet padding.
The agency is doing animal testing to determine if those substances are
pulmonary and/or sensory irritants.  The work is not intended to replicate
studies done by Anderson Labs of Dedham, Mass., which showed that certain
carpet chemicals affected mice.  When the current mouse trials are done, CPSC
likely will assess chemicals' effect on humans.

CPSC met Dec. 15 with Air Quality Sciences, which also is testing carpets for
irritants, to discuss the timing and protocols for testing.  The agency
worked with the Environmental Protection Agency and industry in developing
protocols.

OVERHEATED CANDLE HOLDERS THAT CAN SHATTER RECALLED

Glass candle holders that can overheat and shatter have been recalled by
Godinger Silver Art of Brooklyn, N.Y.  Spokesman Abe Freund told PSL the firm
learned problem from a customer who called in a minor hand injury.  The firm
then tested the product in its lab and it failed.  Silver Art immediately
contacted CPSC and a recall notice was put out days later.  Freund said no
other injuries have been reported.

The "Tree Shaped 7 Light Votive Holder" measures 12.75 inches high and 13.75
inches wide at the base and was packaged with four green and three red small
glass pots that votive candles can be placed in.  Major retail department and
gift stores sold the candle holders nationwide from September 1995 through
December 1995 for $25 each.  About 19,000 silver-plated (item #1753) and
brass-plated (item #1753B) holders were recalled.

International Silver of Boston, Mass., also recalled the same product (item
#991194751) but sold it for $19 to $24 in nationwide in stores and on the
Home Shopping Network.  International Silver got seven reports of the glass
pots shattering including one in which the consumer's leg was injured.

SQUEAKER TOYS HELD UP BY CUSTOMS GET RECALLED

The Customs Service held up squeaker toys by Accoutrements of Seattle, Wash.,
from entering the U.S. since the squeaker device can separate from the toy
and pose a choking hazard for young children.  Accoutrements Assistant
Manager Stacey Jones said the firm has never received a complaint about the
toy in its five-year history and this was a "just in case" precaution the
firm decided to take.

The pickle toys sold for 35 cents from August 1991 through November 1995 while
the $2.50 kangaroo toys sold from May 1990 through November 1995 in retail,
toy, museum, chain and drug stores nationwide.  Squeak Pickles toy item S877
were sold individually from bags of 12 labeled in part "***The Coral
Line***Accoutrements***Not for children under three*** made in China."  The
green rubber pickles each measure 3.5 inches long.

Squeak Kangaroo and baby kangaroo toys, item 9394, were sold as a set and
labelled in part "**Great Motherhood***For ages three and up***Squeaking***
Kangaroo***Made in China***S.D.S. toys***."  The gray and black kangaroo is 5
inches while the baby kangaroo is 1.5 inches and fits in the kangaroo's
pouch.

TOO MANY LEAF BLOWER WARRANTEE CLAIMS ALERT RECALL

Too many customer warrantee claims for leaking leaf blower fuel tanks alerted
Tanaka America of Kent, Wash., to recall 11,000 Tanaka and Ariens leaf
blowers due to potential fire hazards.  A Tanaka America spokesman told PSL
that no injuries or complaints were reported, but the firm wanted to forge
ahead with recalling models TBL-455, TBL-500 and BB-430.  The $400 to $460
blower sold nationwide from January 1986 to December 1992.

The Japan-made leaf blower is mounted on a metal backpack frame with padded
shoulder straps, an orange fuel tank and black blower tube with name and
model numbers of the manufacturer are printed in the center of the blower's
fuel tank or on the recoil starter.

The Tanaka spokesman said he was not sure how many blowers were on the market
but that the firm is notifying consumers from its warrantee card files.
Customers are being told to make returns to any authorized Tanaka service
dealer for a free fuel tank replacement.  Only new and improved leaf blowers
are being manufactured.

RATTLES BY GYMBOREE RECALLED FOR CHOKING HAZARD

Rattles that can come apart and release a small bell and wooden pieces have
been recalled by Gymboree of Burlingame, Calif., because they could pose
choking hazards to young children.  Over 2,800 "GymRattles" infant rattles
sold from July 26 to November.

The wooden rattle is 4.5 inches long and has a circular wooden handle, and
multi-colored, cylinder-shaped cage with a small silver bell inside.  The
rattle's hang tag reads in part "GYMBOREE...GymRattle...Crafted in solid
maple wood...Recommended for ages 3 to 18 months."

The rattles sold nationwide at over 240 Gymboree stores for $8 each.
Gymboree representative, George Rodriguez, told PSL the rattle problem was
discovered by one of Gymboree's retail stores and reported to CPSC
immediately.

Though no consumer complaints were reported the firm decided to conduct the
recall to prevent any possibility of injury.  Rodriguez said Gymboree is
mostly known for its children's apparel, and the rattles make up a minute
part of the business.  The firm has asked consumers to return the rattles to
the place of purchase for a full refund.

CELLULAR PHONE CHARGERS CAN POSE ELECTRICAL SHOCK

Cellular phone charger plug prongs that can loosen and become lodged in
electrical outlets pose electrical shock hazards when consumers try removing
the prongs from the outlet.  No injuries have been reported.

Mascot Electronic of Fredrikstad, Norway, is recalling 65,800 ACH-4U cellular
phone chargers used with Nokia phones.  Nokia had received reports that the
charger's plastic cover can crack, thus leading to the plug prongs located on
the charger's back becoming loosened.  The recall applies to chargers with
date codes 9531 through 9546.  "Made in Norway," model number and date code
appear on the label affixed to the charger.

The rectangular, black, plastic charger is three inches long, 2.5 inches
wide, one inch tall and has grooves on the side.  The chargers were sold na-
tionwide from July to November under the brand names Nokia and AT&T.  Phone
dealers sold the chargers separately or as part of a basic sales package.
Mascot manufactured the chargers for Nokia.

HONG KONG PASSES NEW CONSUMER SAFETY REGULATIONS

Consumer goods in Hong Kong now will have to be "reasonably safe" under the
October 1995 Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance.  Hong Kong's Secretary for
Trade and Industry is responsible for approving safety standards and has the
authority to ban unsafe products from the marketplace.  Those violating the
new law face fines or jail.

Hong Kong's Commissioner of Customs and Excise can require responsible
parties to issue a public notice, preventing the parties from supplying or
selling unsafe products.  The commissioner can also order involved parties to
initiate a recall.

Though labs must be approved by the director general of industry, those
accredited under the Hong Kong Laboratory Scheme (HOKLAS) can issue test
certificates that demonstrate compliance with applicable standards.  Relevant
test certificates can also be issued if the lab has a memorandum of
understanding with HOKLAS.

EXTENDED PETITION PERIOD FOR CHILD RESTRAINT SEATS

Makers of portable child restraint systems will have until Sept. 1, 1996, to
comply with new size and weight requirements for test dummies.  The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the deadline should
provide needed leadtime for firms to make necessary design changes to conform
to the new requirements.

In July 1995, a final rule amending Standard 213 added three dummies to child
restraint testing including a newborn infant, 9-month-old and 6-year-old.
The 6-month-old dummy has been removed from future testing.

NHTSA deems the new testing provisions as a more thorough evaluation of child
restraint performance.  Petitions for reconsideration should be sent to
Administrator, Room 5220, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400
Seventh Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 by Jan. 11.  For nonlegal issues,
contact George Mouchachoir at 202/366-4919, and for legal issues contact
Deirdre Fujita at 202/366-2992.
