<p> <b>Results of Study with Smoked Marijuana<br>
</b> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">The Protocols</font></u><font size="2">.
Three protocols were developed based on experiences since March
of 1980: Protocol IV, Revised Operational Protocol for Smoked
Marijuana, and Revised Protocol for Smoked Marijuana (Appendix
IX).<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The initial Smoked Marijuana Protocol
(Protocol IV) was limited to inpatients who were experienced
marijuana smokers and receiving Cisplatin, Dacarbazine and/or
5-Azacytadine.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1981, the Smoked Marijuana Protocol was
modified to permit outpatients and marijuana naive' patients to
participate. In addition, patients receiving radiation therapy
were then allowed to use smoked marijuana.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1983, another revision was made to adapt to
the limited number of patients choosing to use smoked marijuana.
This protocol allowed all patients, regardless of their
anticancer treatment, to have access to smoked marijuana. A
standardized smoking technique was described and the use of a
water pipe was encouraged to modify the harshness of the smoke
which was a deterrent for patients using smoked marijuana in the
previous protocols. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u>Minimal Accrual</u>. The marijuana cigarette protocol
attracted only 119 patients, less than five percent of the total
number enrolled in the Cannabis Therapeutic Program. Anecdotal
reports suggested that reasons for the low accrual included a
general objection to smoking on the part of some patients, their
oncologists, or their hospitals, and some reluctance to use a
drug associated with street use.<br>
</p>

<p> The characteristics of the NIDA cigarettes may have been a
factor in discouraging further use by experieced marijuana
smokers. The cigarettes, even after proper storage, were dry and
gave an acrid smoke. Their potency was noticeably low at a time
when street marijuana was increasing greatly in potency and
availability. <br>
</p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Data Collection</font></u><font size="2">.
As each protocol was changed data forms were also <b>revised </b>in
an effort to increase enrollment by reducing any burden of
paperwork for investigators and patients. <b>All </b>data forms
associated with the various protocols are included in the
appendices.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The report form included with the latest
revision of the protocol <b>(2/11/83) </b>requested only
information which <b>was </b>considered essential and, for the
purpose of this evaluation, data from the previous forms <b>were </b>transcribed
to the newer form for consistency in coding. This point is
elaborated in <b>a </b>following section on validity of results.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Potency Increase</font></u><font size="2">.
The potency of the marijuana cigarettes being used <b>was </b>changed
in April of 1983 from <b>1.2% </b>to <b>2.8% THC </b>content.
This increase <b>was not </b>considered in our <b>analysis.<br>
</b></font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Patients</font></u><font size="2">. The
Panel received 218 treatment episode reports for 119 total
patients treated with smoked marijuana. Eight reports were
received for 3 patients treated with both smoked marijuana and
THC capsules. Twenty-one of the 119 patients had been previously
treated under other Cannabis Therapeutic Program protocols.
Reports on 98 patients are therefore available for analysis of
the 'first treatment episode' on the Cannabis Therapeutic
Program. Table U reflects characteristics of the 98 patients
whose reports are analyzed and Table V summarizes the primary
tumor sites.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Evaluation of the Antiemetic Properties</font></u><font
size="2">. As shown in Table W, only 4.1% of the patients
reported mild or no nausea during their first smoked marijuana
protected treatment episode. And, 46.72 reported vomiting of 3
times or less during their first treatment episode.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Overall assessment of the effectiveness was
rated very or moderately successful by 58.7%. The relative
effectiveness of smoked and orally ingested THC are similar.
Table X includes the column on THC capsules from Table R for
comparison. Anecdotal reports by a few patients who had used both
marijuana cigarettes and THC, rated the effectiveness of the
smoked marijuana as comparable to that of the oral THC used in
this study. </font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Side Effects</font></u><font size="2">.
Side effects are reported in Table Y which also presents the data
on THC alone (from Table S) for comparison. The slightly more
intense side effects after smoked marijuana are not surprising in
view of its more rapid onset. <u>Presumably</u>, they persisted
for a shorter time but no such measurements were recorded in this
study.<br>

<p> <u><font size="2">Patient Drop-out Rates</font></u><font
size="2">. Thirtyfour patients continued on to two or more
treatment episodes using smoked marijuana. Sixty-four patients
dropped from the study. The reasons for dropping are detailed
below in Table Z. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Reliability Estimate of Results</font></u><font
size="2">. There were three basic concerns regarding the
reliability of the marijuana protocol results: 1) the change in
the data forms, 2) the change in the protocols themselves, and 3)
the change in the potency of the marijuana cigarettes. Each of
these may influence the kind of data reported.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since the potency changed from 1.2% to 2.8%
THC, any patients smoking marijuana after April 1983, were
smoking marijuana that was roughly twice as potent. This may or
may not have been considered by the prescribing physician and/or
pharmacist in calculating and marking the dosage. There was
general confusion about how to calculate dose. Sometimes the
number of cigarettes used was listed. Also, patients not smoking
the entire dose may not have had this fact recorded, and there
was variation in smoking technique. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1983, eligibility requirements were changed
to permit outpatients and inexperienced marijuana smokers to
participate. The smoking method was changed, increasing the
amount of time the smoke is held in the lungs. Water pipes were
also permitted. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">With each protocol change there were changes
in the data forms. The original data form had different labels on
the side effect<br>

<p> <font size="2">categories (none, tolerable, intolerable).
More than one treatment episode could be reported on one form.
Also, the patient reports had categories dealing with mood. The
next data form revision changed the category labels of side
effects to none, moderate and severe. One treatment episode was
reported per form. Mood was deleted from the patient reports. The
final revision is the one sheet form.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The protocol directed that four doses of
marijuana should be administered prior to chemotherapy, but the
data form also provided a place to enter the actual number of
'doses prior' as 'other.' The patient evaluation form was
discontinued and the investigator (or his/her staff) evaluated
the nausea, vomiting and overall effectiveness. In tabulating the
data the physician's assessment was used. The number of side
effect categories was increased to four: none, mild, moderate,
and severe. The mean value of patient reports was used. If it
fell between categories, it was rounded up when converted to the
new form. The dosage level was a fixed choice.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The coding process attempted to take into
consideration these changes and standardized the data onto the
one page data collection form (Treatment Report Form A).<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Protocol Exceptions (Pilot Protocols)<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Protocols initially available under the
Cannabis Therapeutic Program were limited to antinauseant use of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to patients undergoing
chemotherapy for cancer. In 1983, the Panel began to receive
requests for THC from physicians with patients who suffered
intractable nausea and vomiting from conditions <u>other than
chemotherapy</u>. These patients did not meet the strict criteria
of the Panel's other protocols, but needed an alternative to the
standard treatments available for nausea and vomiting. THC was
considered to be their antiemetic of last resort. The &quot;pilot
protocols' provided a treatment option for desperate patients
unresponsive to standard treatments.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">By the end of the study, 29 patients, all
seriously ill, had been approved to receive THC as an antiemetic
treatment of last resort. Two patients did not receive drug
treatment.. A total of 28 reports of treatment episodes were
received; one patient received two THC treatments. Conditions for
which THC was tried as an antiemetic included acute leukemia,
acute myelocytic leukemia, bone marrow transplant, terminal
melanoma, terminal breast cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, etc.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In summary, physicians rated the overall
antiemetic effectiveness of THC as very effective for fourteen
treatments, moderately effective for five treatments, slightly
effective for two treatments and not effective for seven
treatments. Other notable THC benefits reported included improved
appetites, an increased ability to participate in family
functions and an overall improvement in spirits. No serious side
effects were reported.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Results of the Controlled Study Protocols<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">THC plus Transdermal Scopolamine</font></u><font
size="2">. A two arm placebo controlled study was intended to
test the hypothesis that antiemetic therapy with THC would be
optimized by combining its use with transdermal scopolamine,
(Transderm V). The purpose of the study was to determine
antiemetic efficacy, side effects and drop out rate of the
combination regimen versu's THC alone using the cumulative, low
dose regimen. The investigation was limited to 5 investigators at
selected clinical sites. The Panel hoped to establish statistical
significance early by means of sequential analysis, anticipating
30 to 50 patients.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Transderm V Protocol began in late 1983,
and continued into 1986. Sixty-five patients were enrolled in
this study. However, no conclusion about efficacy was possible by
the end of the Cannabis Therapeutic Program, since only ten of
the 65 patients who enrolled met the stringent study criteria and
completed both arms of the study.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">THC in Combination with Dexamethasone</font></u><font
size="2">. The Dexamethasone Protocol like the Transderm Protocol
above was also a two arm placebo controlled study. It was
intended to test the hypothesis that antiemetic therapy with THC
would be optimized by combining its use with dexamethasone.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Dexamethasone Protocol also was initiated
in late 1983, and continued into 1984; however, of the four
patients who entered the study only one patient completed the
necessary two trials.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol </font></u><font
size="2">(delta-8-THC), a synthetic cannabinoid, is not present
in natural marijuana. It is similar in action to delta-9-THC, the
oral THC administered in the Cannabis Therapeutic Program, but
some reports in the medical literature suggested that it caused
fewer central nervous system side effects than delta-9-THC.
Because side effects may limit the maximum tolerated dose and may
deter some patients from continuing THC therapy even though it
may be relieving nausea and vomiting, such properties of
delta-8-THC could offer a major advantage. The Panel was
encouraged in the effort by Dr. Perez-Reyes, author of some of
the studies referred to above.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Panel engaged Dr. Perez Reyes to consult
in developing a pilot research project on the effects of
delta-8-THC as an., antiemetic. 'In October 1983, the Panel
submitted an investigational New Drug Application (IND 124,094)
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Patients were first
enrolled in October 1983.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Only ten patients were enrolled in this study.
Results on this small number cannot be interpreted except
anecdotally. The drug was used on two patients over a longterm
period resulting in the following comments:<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Patient D received 26 treatment episodes over
a 10 month period. After her initial three treatments, during
which the patient rated delta-8-THC moderately or very effective,
the drug dosing schedule was modified to a single 20mg. dose. The
patient continued to benefit. For the next 20 treatment episodes
with this modified dose, she rated the drug very effective for 17
treatments, had no or only mild nausea and vomiting, and suffered
only dry mouth and sedation as side effects. (Overall
effectiveness ratings were missing from three treatment
episodes.) However, during treatment episode number 23, the
patient experienced anxiety and said she felt 'funny or crazy.'
To minimize these effects, the dose was lowered to 10mg. for
treatments 24 to 26. The-drug was rated very effective for
treatment 24 but not effective for treatments 25 and 26. The
protocol nurse had not indicated any change in the patient's
chemotherapy regimen or concurrent medications during those
treatment episodes. The patient elected not to take further
delta-8-THC.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Patient Z received twelve treatments over a
total of 5 months (2 months with delta-8-THC, 2 months off the
drug while undergoing radiation therapy, then a return to 3
months with delta-8-THC). Delta8-THC was rated as beneficial with
a variety of combinations of chemotherapy agents (BCKU + CYC +
VCR; ADR; CYC + VCR). The patient rated the drug very effective
for 5 treatment episodes and moderately effective for 6. Several
side effects were experienced during all treatment episodes, but
all were reported as mild. However, on the patient's last
treatment, he began a new chemotherapy regimen (ARA-C + MTX) and
found delta-8-THC not effective.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Glaucoma Protocol<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1983, the Legislature considered anecdotal
reports from a few patients with glaucoma, and other individuals,
and noted the evidence that oral THC and smoked marijuana lowered
intra-ocular pressure. In response, the legislation that extended
the Cannabis Therapeutic Program also mandated exploration of the
therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in glaucoma, an assignment
with complexities beyond those encountered in the cancer
chemotherapy program.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Prior to designing a clinical trial, the Panel
co-opted the services of an ophthalmologist and distributed a
questionnaire that queried every ophthalmologist in the State
about the probable availability of patients and for their
suggestions. The Panel then prepared-and submitted an application
for an Investigational New Drug Exemption (IND), accepted by the
Food and Drug Administration as 123,373, that included a protocol
(Appendix XIII) for the evaluation of oral-THC and smoked
marijuana in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In preparing this protocol, the Panel
considered the nature of the disease and the availability of
other treatment in establishing criteria for the acceptance of
patients into the program.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There are several variants of glaucoma. All
are characterized by an elevation of the pressure within the
eyeball, where pressure is transmitted to the optic nerve with,
consequently, a possible loss of vision. However, the rate of
progression, threat to vision and modes of treatment differ for
different types of glaucoma. Moreover, effective treatment with
drugs or, in a few situations, surgery, is available for most
patients, a contrast with the nausea and vomiting of cancer
chemotherapy.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">To be certain that no patient was deprived of
treatment of established efficacy by the research needs of the
Panel, patients were accepted only if they had open-angle
glaucoma inadequately controlled by conventional,
non-investigational treatment. To be certain that the desire of
the patient to use THC was not generated by emotion or by
proselytizing efforts directed toward 'legalized' marijuana, a
&quot;Patient Qualification Review Board' was established to
scrutinize the medical history of each prospective patient to
ensure that their enrollment was appropriate. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1984, the Panel conducted a vigorous
program to publicize the Panel's investigational glaucoma
treatment to ophthalmologists and prospective patients. In
addition to the usual press releases, every ophthalmologist
received a mailing. The Panel arranged a program at Grand Rounds
at the University of California Medical School in San Francisco
for 200 ophthalmologists in Northern California and contacted
individual doctors known for their special interest or influence.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nevertheless, by the end of the program, only
twenty ophthalmologists were approved as investigators and, of
the twelve patients who expressed interest, only nine received
treatment. All nine were Mend-stage glaucoma' for whom it was
felt that no other treatment alternatives could be offered. All
nine chose oral THC rather than smoked marijuana.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Results</font></u><font size="2">. The
results of treatment can be quickly summarized because all nine
patients withdrew from treatment. Four withdrew because of side
effects at 3 weeks, 2 months, and five months (2); one for lack
of efficacy (4 months); two progressed to cataract extraction and
did not resume treatment (5 months, 9 months); one changed
doctors (15 months) and one concluded after 7 months that the
drug was no longer needed, a conclusion not shared by the doctor.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These patients did, however, contribute
information in two areas.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Side Effects</font></u><font size="2">.
These patients provided reassurance about chronically
administered THC in that they took doses ranging from 2.5 to
17.5mg four tim es each day for 1-9 months. The patient who took
THC for 9 months used gradually increasing amounts until she was
taking 17.5mg four times each day. The most frequent side effects
were dry mouth, sedation, ataxia and dizziness. The impression
was that the side effects lessened with continued treatment. No
serious or unexpected reactions were seen...<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Effect on Intra-ocular</font></u> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Pressure</font></u><font size="2">. The
doctor's judgement of the patient's clinical status did not
provide any evidence of effectiveness although some initial, but
not lasting, improvement was claimed.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The measurement of intra-ocular pressure (IOP)
should provide an objective measure of drug effect, but
variability was somewhat greater than expected, possibly because
the measurement was made at varying times after the application
of the standard treatment, which was continued when the THC was
started. Some of the patients showed an initial decrease in IOP
from base line levels, but this lowering was sustained in only
two patients. Even in these two patients, the possibility is that
THC, an anxiety relieving drug, or the increased attention of the
drug trial increased patient compliance with their standard
treatment.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Post Marketing Survey of Investigators<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Eighteen months after dronabinol reached the
market, the Panel decided to audit its function and survey the
use of THC as a marketed drug. To accomplish these goals, a
survey was mailed to 237 oncologists-investigators. A reminder
postcard was mailed one week later and a 622 (n-148) response
rate was achieved. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Prescribing of Dronabinol</font></u><font
size="2">. The survey asked to what extent dronabinol had been
prescribed over the 18 months since it became available. Of the
respondents, 103 (70%) indicated that they had continued to
prescribe tetrahydrocannabinol as dronabinol. The other 45 (302)
indicated they had not ordered THC since they prescribed it under
the Cannabis Therapeutic Program. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Those investigators who reported that they had
not used commercial dronabinol were also the investigators who
had treated fewer patients with investigational THC during the
program. The 45 investigators who are not using THC had treated
only 304 patients during the Cannabis Therapeutic Program
(average of 6.8 patients each). The 103 who now use dronabinol
had treated 1163 patients during the Cannabis Therapeutic Program
(average of 11.3 patients each). The survey shows a tendency for
those oncologists who used experimental THC more extensively
during the Panel's compassionate access program to continue to
prescribe dronabinol. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The survey instrument was intended to
establish the factors responsible for restricted use: efficacy,
undesirable side effects, price, the triplicate prescription form
requirement, and the strict limitations of the FDA approved
package insert. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Table A&amp; <u>summarizes</u> the
respondents' responses to this question. Physicians who did not
order THC cited side effects, ineffectiveness and availability of
other effective antiemetics (reported most often as a comment) as
reasons for not prescribing dronabinol. Those using THC for their
patients included cost and triplicate form requirement as the
primary concerns and causes of limited use.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The influence of patient demand on prescribers
is reported in Table AB. Those who do not order THC are not
influenced by patient demand.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <u><font size="2">Impressions of Efficacy</font></u><font
size="2">. There was no significant difference between those who
order and those who do not in reports of the number of
antiemetics that would be tried first before prescribing
dronabinol. See Table AC.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Polypharmacy is still popular. Of those using
dronabinol 58.3% (n - 60) used it in combination with other
antiemetics. (Note that in our analysis of the combination study,
little or no advantage in combination antiemetic therapy was
actually found. See page 36.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The dronabinol prescribers have somewhat more
favorable opinion of dronabinol's efficacy for nausea than have
the non-prescribers in this survey. See figures I and 2.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The difference in opinion between the two
groups of dronabinol's efficacy for vomiting is somewhat less.
See figures 3 and 4.<br>

<p> Evaluation of the Cannabis Therapeutic Program. </p>

<p> In general, our investigators were favorably disposed toward
the Panel's efforts to carry out the objectives of the Cannabis
Therapeutic Program. See figure 5.<br>
<br>
<font size="2">Discussion of Results of <u>Cannabis </u>Therapeutic
Program<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A general consistency was noted in results of
impression of effectiveness of THC and smoked marijuana as an
antiemetic throughout the various protocols.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Side effects are significant, but were never
observed to be life threatening. Clinically serious adverse
reactions, defined as reactions while taking THC or marijuana
that required the use of drugs or hospitalization of the patient,
were observed primarily at the beginning of the study. Nine cases
were reported during the first 1569 patients and only one
throughout the balance of the study. This great reduction in
severe side effects may be due to several factors: 1) The
recommended initial dosage was first lowered from 7.5 to 5mg/m2.
2) Then, cumulative dosing technique was recommended. 3) Patients
with metastes to the brain were excluded from the study. 4)
Perhaps as the hospital staff became more familiar with the
clinical use of this disinhibiting drug, they were better able to
allay a feeling of panic in the inexperienced subjects. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Panel noted a number of problems in the
conduct of such a large multi-investigator study. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is difficult to determine the degree of
uniformity among investigators in their interpretation of 'Mild,'
'Moderate,&amp; or 'Severe.In some cases the reports received
from investigators were incomplete. In a few cases it was
apparent that second and subsequent treatment reports were merely
copies of prior reports. Treatment reports beyond the first were
not extensively utilized in the Panel's analysis of data.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The requirements for compassionate access to
THC and smoked marijuana made the use of a true control group
impossible. The publicity given compassionate access somewhat
reduced investigator compliance and reduced the strictness of
Panel requirements. Nevertheless, a few investigators were
dropped from the study due to lack of cooperation.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The attempt by the Panel to conduct smaller
controlled studies within the overall Cannabis Therapeutic
Program was inhibited by the lack of funds to provide physician
investigators the financial incentive usually offered by
industrial sponsors of new drug investigations. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In spite of the problems, the Panel has been
able to gather valuable information on side effects of THC
therapy and dosing approaches which will minimize these side
effects. Also, even though this was not a formal, blinded,
efficacy study the tabulation of reports of impression of
effectiveness is a valuable predictor of the clinical future for
this drug.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <center><font size="2">APPROVAL BY FDA FOR MARKETING OF THC</font></center>
</p>

<p> <center><font size="2">AND CONCLUSION</font></center> </p>

<p> <center><font size="2">OF THE CANNABIS THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Approval and Rescheduling <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
required the same sequence of pre-marketing human trial a to
demonstrate safety and effectiveness for THC as for any new drug.
The Phase II, or controlled, double-blind studies, were
previously reported in the literature. The Phase III studies that
are represented by the Cannabis</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Therapeutic Program's trials are uncontrolled,
but involve a large number of patients. In this phase, the Panel
provided the largest experience simulating conditions of actual
practice, that is, the California Program was a successful Phase
III study useful to the FDA. The Research Advisory Panel, its
cooperative investigators and NCI's supply of investigational
drug subsidized the marketing of dronabinol. Under the usual
circumstances the cost for the data provided in such a study
would have exceeded $1.5 million.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1985, the FDA concluded that the efficacy
and safety of THC were well enough established to justify
approval of dronabinol for marketing under highly restricted
conditions. This action by the FDA did not immediately terminate
the need for the compassionate access protocol. Approval jointly
by the FDA and DEA of the use of THC for a single application and
in a single dose form, i.e.. the oral capsule, did not override
existing California laws and regulations.<br>
<br>
In October 1986, both Federal and State laws and regulations were
changed and THC, now classed as a Schedule II controlled
substance and requiring the use of the California Triplicate
Prescription Form, became available as a prescription drug
marketed as dronabinol (Marinol). Thus, much of the need for the
Cannabis Therapeutic Program ended.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">During the transition period between FDA
approval and the ultimate rescheduling of dronabinol (Marinol,
THC) in California, the Panel minimized confusion by publishing
pertinent information in the newsletters of various California
licensing authorities and professional societies. <br>
<br>
Investigational THC No Longer Supplied by NCI<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The National Cancer Institute stopped
supplying investigational THC after September 30, 1986; however,
any investigational THC remaining in California pharmacies was
available to approved investigators. The Panel monitored the use
through August 1987, and audited the return to the DEA of unused
supplies. At no time during the program were there any
discrepancies in inventory or suspicion of diversion. It was
occasionally necessary to require some investigators to file
missing treatment reports (discovered by review of pharmacy
records) by considering denial of investigational privileges. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dronabinol finally became available as a
Schedule II drug in California on October 1, 1986. It is
important to note that only synthetic THC in sesame oil and
encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule has been rescheduled.
Other forms of marijuana and THC remain Schedule I under both
California and federal Controlled Substances laws.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has
stressed that dronabinol should be prescribed only for its
FDA-approved use: the <u>treatment</u> of nausea and vomiting
associated with <u>cancer chemotherapy </u>in patients who have
failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetics. FDA
labeling states that this restriction is required because a
substantial proportion of patients treated with dronabinol can be
expected to experience disturbing psychotomimetic reactions not
observed with other antiemetic agents. The FDA-approved labeling
also declares that dronabinol is <u>contraindicated</u> in
patients whose nausea and vomiting arises from any cause other
than cancer chemotherapy. DEA warned in its regulation which
rescheduled dronabinol, that it may revoke a registrant's
Schedule II license and pursue any criminal sanctions warranted
under the Controlled Substances Act if a practitioner distributes
or dispenses dronabinol in a manner that constitutes a threat to
the public safety.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Investigators and pharmacies had been advised
that marijuana cigarettes would continue to be available through
the Panel's Smoked Marijuana Protocol at least through the end of
1988. In spite of this continued availability, there has been
little or no interest in continued study of marijuana cigarettes
by the Panel's investigators.<br>
