NCR UNVEILS SIIPS
New Product Features POD, Customer-Facing Applications

     NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, hopes to boost its standing in the top
250 U.S. banks this year with its long-awaited Scalable Image Item
Processing Solution (SIIPS), due to be released at presstime (IPR,
Sept. 28).
     SIIPS is a client-server-based image system that supports NCR's
7780 transport and is compatible with the widely-used Check Processing
Control Software (CPCS) from IBM Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., and
SuperMICR software from Computer Associates of Islandia, N.Y.  
     End users who have waited more than a year for SIIPS to be
released look to the system as an alternative to image-based item
processing systems from IBM, Unisys Corp. of Blue Bell, Pa. and
BancTec Inc. of Dallas.

Better Way To Handle Checks

     Newly renamed NCR (see story, p. 7) hopes SIIPS can take
advantage of rising interest among large banks for imaging to boost
productivity, reduce labor costs, beef-up services and generate new
fees, said Mike Visser, assistant vice president of item processing
products at NCR.
     Ed McHugh, director of payment systems at Unisys, estimates that
the market for imaging in the top 250 U.S. banks could exceed $300
million this year. 
     Some 70 percent of these banks already have at least one image
application in beta testing or live production, he added.  These range
from image proof-of-deposit (POD) to image-cash management to low-
volume transports for niche work.
     McHugh added that the number of imaging applications used by top
banks could rise as merged banks integrate their individual processing
systems to reduce costs and boost productivity.  
     In addition, NCR believes image systems, such as SIIPS, will draw
interest from banks trying to manage their growing check volumes. 
Despite the promise of electronic alternatives, check volume has grown
by at least 2.3 percent annually since 1989, noted Jim Moore,
president of Mentis Corp. in Durham, N.C.
     "I can't imagine a competitive bank not having the beginnings of
an imaging strategy in place this year," said Geoff Emerson, general
manager at IBM.

Expect More SIIPS-like Products

     NCR is confident it can tap into this growing interest in imaging
and sell SIIPS to at least 20 of the top 250 U.S. banks this year,
Visser said.  
     He admits that this will be a tall order since NCR faces
competition from IBM and Unisys, which have offered their own high-
speed image check processing systems for several years.  But NCR plans
to stress its system's scalability, low cost of ownership and host
software compatibility, Visser explained.
     "If the scope of SIIPS is to totally replace what goes on in
check processing right now, NCR will have its hands full with four or
five installations this year," an industry watcher told IPR.  "If the
scope of SIIPS is only to replace proof departments, NCR could get
seven or eight deals."
     The source added that large banks will be reluctant to buy SIIPS
this year because NCR doesn't have a proven track record in high-speed
image processing.
     In addition, NCR is counting on SIIPS to give the vendor momentum
in large banks, noted Greg Schratwieser, president of International
Consulting Inc. in Fairfax, Va.  Some long-time users of NCR
technology lost faith in the vendor because it took so long to develop
SIIPS, Schratwieser claimed.
     Indeed, it was end users who urged NCR to develop SIIPS itself to
ensure the system has adequate maintenance, quality measures and
support, Visser said.
     SIIPS is the first product to be released by NCR since the
company announced last year it was splitting from AT&T and creating a
new Financial Industry Business Unit to focus on financial systems
(IPR, Sept. 28,).
     "SIIPS is the kind of product we will focus on after the
restructuring," Visser explained.  "It's designed for one of our
traditional business markets, but it leverages our company's
technology and resources in new ways."   
     He added that SIIPS also is a "more complete" item processing
solution than any other product offered by NCR.  "Our business has
been built largely with solutions partners, who understand a
particular application area well and build their processing software
on top of our 7780 transport," Visser said.

A Completely Client-Server-based System

     A key feature of SIIPS is its "completely client-server-based"
architecture, which reduces the image system's upfront costs and makes
it more affordable for banks with lower check processing volumes,
Visser claimed.
     Large-scale image check processing solutions from IBM and Unisys
have elements of a client-server system, such as personal computer-
based keying workstations.  However, they still rely heavily on some
type of mainframe, Visser explained.  "We don't have a mainframe
anywhere in our system," he added.
     This client-server configuration reduces the equipment costs
built into the SIIPS system versus mainframe-based image check
processing systems, Visser said.  "We have seen examples where
equipment costs for SIIPS were between 30 percent and 50 percent less
than equivalent systems from our competition," he said.     

High-speed Balancing, Key-ahead Functions

     Client-server technology also allows NCR to offer a scaled-down
version of SIIPS, which processes about 100,000 proof-of-deposit (POD)
items, for less than $1.5 million -- roughly half the price of an
image system from one of NCR's competitors, Visser estimated.  "Our
smallest configuration is a lot less expensive because our servers and
transports cost less," he said.
     SIIPS also offers the benefit of compatibility with legacy
systems, such as CPCS and SuperMICR software.  "SIIPS thinks it's a
reader-sorter, and it will do all the sorts that the host system wants
it to do," Visser explained.  This helps banks protect their
investments in existing IBM mainframe-based CPCS systems, explained
John Spencer, senior vice president at Frost National Bank of San
Antonio.  Frost currently uses several SIIPS applications.  
     SIPPS also includes a high-speed balancing feature that
identifies and ranks probable causes of error in out-of-balance
transactions.  
     For instance, the system automatically sends items that it
believes are miskeyed to a data-entry clerk for rekeying.  If the
transaction remains out-of-balance, the system sends another item for
reentry or looks for other errors, such as deposit slip mistakes, lost
documents or recognition errors.
     Another useful feature is a key-ahead function built into the
system's image display terminal.  Visser explained that two check
images are displayed on the screen at a time, allowing operators to
key ahead as they would on a proof machine.  The function could help
in training new proof operators, he said.

SIIPS in Live Production at Wachovia

     SIIPS POD and image delivery applications already are in live
production in processing centers at Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem,
N.C., National City of Cleveland, and Frost.  Additional sites
currently are being rolled out.
     Wachovia helped NCR develop the SIIPS POD application and
installed the system at the bank's operations centers in Atlanta,
Columbia, S.C., Raleigh, N.C., and Charlotte, N.C.  Wachovia processes
peak volumes of more than 2 million unencoded items per day using the
four systems, with the Columbia center alone processing more than
800,000 items per day, Visser said.
     "We needed a solution that would coexist with our existing
technology and one that wouldn't outgrow our needs in a couple years,"
said Paul Boone, executive vice president of check operations at the
bank.  Wachovia expects the SIIPS POD system to reduce the bank's
labor and maintenance costs, Boone said. 
     National City, which also worked with NCR as a development
partner, installed SIIPS POD alongside IBM's CPCS version 1.11 host
software at its operations center in Columbus, Ohio.  The bank also
plans to install SIIPS in its three other operations centers, starting
in Cleveland.
    Frost implemented multiple SIIPS applications, including CD-ROM
image delivery, image statements, and SIIPS POD, at its operations
center in San Antonio.  The bank processes more than 300,000 unencoded
items per day.
    Frost currently is installing SIIPS at its remote center in
Houston.
    Meantime, NCR is developing a pre-encoded capture application,
interface software for the IBM 3890 reader-sorter, wholesale and
retail remittance and lockbox applications, and recognition software
upgrades based on technology from AT&T's Bell Labs.  (Mike Visser, NCR

BRANCH OPERATIONS BOOST SIIPS THROUGHPUT

     Changing your branch operations can substantially increase SIIPS
POD throughput, notes system documentation obtained by IPR. 
     For instance, having tellers separate work that includes adding
machine tapes from work that does not, can reduce the time required
for document preparation at the SIIPS POD site.  (Mike Visser, NCR
Corp. 513/445-6646.)

ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY LEADERS FOR 1996

    *  Make imaging your top priority, suggests Don Avedon, president
of Avedon Associates Inc., in Potomac, Md.  Corporate customers will
begin to expect imaging services as they hear about your competition's
offerings.  Consumers also increasingly will have firsthand knowledge
of imaging through home banking packages such as Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows-based products, he says.
    "As more people gain access to imaging ... processors will have
an easier time getting consumers and senior management to accept the
technology," Avedon said.  "It also will be easier for vendors to sell
imaging systems to banks."

    *  Consider adding image check processing, even if you're a bank
with less than $150 million in assests, says Tommy Green, president of
Greenway Corp. in Carrollton, Ga.  "More and more small banks are
adding image systems as a result of falling software and hardware
prices and increasing pressure to keep up with nearby banks that offer
image-based services," Green explained.  
    As evidence, he points to People's State Bank of Groveland, Fla.,
a $60 million asset-bank that recently inked a deal to implement
Greenway's PrimeImage check processing system.  The bank processes an
average 6,000 items per day.
    Green speculated that smaller banks within a 50-mile radius may
partner to buy imaging systems.  For example, First Bank and Trust of
Carrnesville, Ga., and Bank of Toccoa of Toccoa, Ga., purchased
imaging equipment from Greenway but plan to process their checks at
First Commerce Bank of Commerce, Ga.  "By not buying a check sorter,
the banks save about $125,000," Green said.

    *  Balance the benefits of individual image applications with
your long-term, enterprise-wide strategy, recommends Geoff Emerson,
general manager, IBM Corp.  in Charlotte, N.C.  "Consider how all of
your image applications fit together to ensure that your long-term
strategy stays on track," he said.
    Emerson also suggested end users watch for "customer-facing"
image applications with beefed-up functionality.  He explained that
vendors, such as IBM, will focus considerable attention this year on
developing and improving applications where customers know their bank
is using image technology.
    "More and more vendors will provide solutions that allow banks
and processors to use image technology in new ways," Emerson said.

    *  Get your feet wet with electronic check presentment (ECP), if
you already haven't, suggests Steve Takahashi, group senior vice
president for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashi
believes more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin to
exchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boost
productivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage of
ECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.  
    "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gone
live," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to send
but not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchanging
ECP items early this year.

    *  Educate operations employees in on-line communications and
prepare your company for using the Internet to move large volumes of
paper-based information, such as contracts and mortgages, Avedon says. 
"The information technology world eventually will be tied together by
telecommunications," he noted.  "But the typical document imaging
person knows very little about telecommunications."
    Avedon recommended that processors purchase telecommunications
manuals for employees and include operations managers in meetings
where telecommunications staff discuss long-term plans for network
upgrades.  (Don Avedon, Avedon Associates, 301/983-0604; Geoff
Emerson, IBM, 704/594-8099; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO Services
Company, 312/904-7477; Tommy Green, Greenway, 770/834-0090.)

LOWER PRICES, MORE COMPETITION FORESEEN IN REMITTANCE MARKET

    It's going to be a buyer's market this year for image-enabled
remittance systems, predicts Bob Kirk, president of Enterprise
Consulting in Dallas. 
    "There are some significant sales to be made, but I don't think
this will be as big a year for image remittance vendors as the last
two years," Kirk said.  "Most of the large processors have purchased
image remittance systems, and many will focus this year on maximizing
benefits from these new systems."
    Kirk speculated that reduced demand from large processors for
image remittance systems could force vendors to complete up to twice
as many sales in order to make the same amount of money that they made
last year.  
    He added vendors will sell a "fair" number of retail lockbox
systems this year, but most of the buying activity will be in the
wholesale lockbox market. 
    "This is going to be the year that many of the top 50 banks
decide to replace their existing systems because of their high labor
and maintenance costs and limited ability to facilitate new, revenue-
generating features such as CD-ROM delivery," Kirk explained.  These
banks will demand wholesale systems with better data entry
capabilities and beefed-up image production, he added.
    "Nobody has introduced a full-scale imaging system for wholesale
lockbox," Kirk noted, adding that most of the systems used by the top
50 banks rely on technology that is nearly 10 years old.  A number of
these banks already have hired consultants to develop wholesale
lockbox imaging strategies.

Mix and Match System Components

    Kirk also predicted that a growing number of medium- and high-
volume processors will purchase system components from several vendors
to get the best networks, servers, personal computers, transports and
operating systems.
    "As the concept of open systems takes hold, users will realize
that they don't have to rely on one company to provide them a total
solution," Kirk said.
    Indeed, several vendors will introduce platform independent
software this year for remittance processing, predicted Steve McNair,
president of FTP Consulting Services Inc. in Euless, Texas.  "The
vendors offering these systems will make the same base software
available for all of the major hardware platforms in the market,"
McNair explained.  "This will allow end users to mix and match
software and hardware to get a best-of-both-worlds solution."
    Similarly, NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, is working with several
software vendors to qualify their applications to run on NCR's
platform, noted Mike Visser, NCR's assistant vice president of item
processing products.  The company hopes to offer more products that
better suit its customers needs, he said. 
    Combining components from several vendors also helps users
improve system functionality and control costs, Kirk noted.  "When you
buy a solution from one provider, your ability to control costs is
severely limited," he explained.

Consider Small Scale Remittance Systems

    Small-scale image remittance systems, which are designed for
processors with volumes of up to 100,000 transactions per month, also
will become more popular this year, McNair speculated.  These systems
generally are personal computer-based and feature image-enabled
transports with optical character recognition (OCR), intelligent
character recognition (ICR), courtesy amount recognition (CAR), front-
and-back-audit trails, encoding and sort capabilities.
    "Target markets for these systems will be low volume retail
applications such as rural water, gas and electric companies, and
small insurance, mortgage and retail processors," McNair said.  He
added that small-scale image remittance systems offer significant cost
savings versus conventional remittance products in terms of their
relatively low price tag and reduced maintenance costs.  (FTP,

VENDOR URGES BANKS TO START SMALL 

    Software Earnings Inc. of Memphis, Tenn., hopes to boost its
share of the image market this year by convincing banks to "gather the
low-hanging fruit" before image-enabling their proof-of-deposit (POD)
operations.
     "Banks have been scared-off by image proof-of-deposit because it
would force them to change all of their documents and reengineer their
entire organization," says Larry Jones, director of image products
marketing for Software Earnings. 
     "We're telling banks to get their feet wet with imaging by
applying it to applications like exceptions processing, which is
costly and accounts for just 2 percent of a typical bank's total
volume," Jones said.  By gaining experience with image-exceptions,
banks can get comfortable with the technology on a small scale, while
still providing imaging to their customers, he says.
     In addition, image-based exceptions processing offers banks a
higher marginal return on their investment than image-enabled POD and
in-clearings.  The reason:  Compared to the cost of handling a check,
exceptions items are up to 300 times more expensive, depending on the
type of exception, Jones explained. 
     "Vendors have been trying to create an attractive payback on
image-enabled POD for five years and it's still not there," he said.
     "Processors have got MICR-based POD down to a science, which
means banks need to achieve high volumes before they'll see a
significant return on their imaging investment," Jones explained. 
Plus, image-exceptions systems cost about $500,000, while enterprise-
wide, image item processing solutions cost up to $70 million per
institution, he estimated. 
    ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc. of Chicago, which recently signed
a deal with Software Earnings for multiple imaging applications (IPR,
Oct. 26, p. 8), adds that the revenue potential of image-exceptions is
"icing on the cake."  
    "The overall cost of the system is easily cost-justified by the
savings realized through reject repair, balance assist, and the return
items interface," said Steve Takahashi, its group senior vice
president of check operations.
    By adding image-based exceptions processing, Takahashi hopes to
reduce his bank's exceptions staff by 25 percent.  (Larry Jones,
Software Earnings Inc., 513/445-4178; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO
Services Company Inc., 312/904-7477.)

AT&T GIS REVERTS TO NCR NAME. 

    Hardware giant AT&T Global Information Solutions of Dayton, Ohio,
changed its name back to NCR Corp. in anticipation of splitting from
AT&T next year.  NCR also announced a multi-year deal to make Bell
Labs of Basking Ridge, N.J., its primary research organization, and
unveiled an updated company logo.  "The name change is not a magic
elixir for solving the problems of this company," admitted Lars
Nyberg, NCR's chief executive officer.  "Our return to profitability
depends on our ability to deliver in the marketplace."  AT&T announced
plans last year to split into three companies (IPR, Sept. 28, p. 1): 
AT&T, which will provide communications services; a yet-to-be-named
systems and technology company; and NCR, which will focus on business
computing.  AT&T Global Information Solutions (GIS) was forced to
change its name since it won't be permitted to use the AT&T name and
logo after the spin-off.  NCR, which merged in 1991 with AT&T, was
renamed AT&T GIS in January 1994.  However, many industry players
continued referring to the company as NCR, we're told.  An updated NCR
logo will be phased in on equipment this year.  (NCR, 513/445-6646.)

GEOSERVE OFFERS CHECK IMAGING.

    Chemical Banking Corp.'s Geoserve division is offering check
images on CD-ROMs to controlled disbursement customers of Chemical
Bank Delaware.  The service helps companies file, store and retrieve
checks faster than paper-based checks, the bank says.  Geoserve
piloted check imaging in the third quarter of 1995 with 10 companies,
ranging in size from Fortune 10 to middle market.  "In particular, the
ability to pull up a copy of a check during the reconcilement process
was cited as a key benefit by almost all of the participants," said
Vince Caranante, the bank's vice president and senior product manager
for disbursement services.  Chemical noted check imaging also offers
reduced costs and improved customer service.  (Chemical Bank, 212/270-

TIPS TO BOOST DEMAND FOR IMAGE STATEMENT BINDERS

    Hold after-hour receptions for key bank customers, such as
merchant accounts, to boost the number of customers that pick up their
image statement binders, recommends Phillip Crane, director of
marketing for Vulcan Binder and Cover in Vincent, Ala.  
    Serve refreshments, give customers a tour of your imaging
operations and have your marketing department speak on the benefits of
image, Crane suggested.
    More and more banks provide free binders as a customer service
when they make the transition to image statements.  Of the 200 banks
that Vulcan knows are adding imaging, only 12 have decided not to
offer binders to their customers.
    Crane noted that getting customers to pick up their binders can
help improve customer acceptance of imaging.  Here are other statement
binder tips:

*  Hold a series of seminars, luncheons and visits with your merchant
customers and their certified public accountants to give them their
binders and to let them know what technology is available and how it
can be tailored to their needs, suggests Dean Tingey, senior vice
president at First National Bank and Trust Co. in Asheboro, N.C.  Have
branch managers provide a contact at each business and help the
marketing department make calls to set up the meetings.

*  Have your binder supplier print your bank's name and slogan on the
side of boxes containing image statement binders, Crane suggested. 
Stacking the boxes in a pyramid in each of your branches will draw
attention to your bank's image statement roll out and help solve your
storage crunch, he explained.  Tip:  Consider mailing binders to
customers, such as the elderly, who may have trouble picking up their
binders at their branch, Crane said.

*  Show customers sample binders before implementing imaging, says
Theresa Lyons, customer service representative at Jeff Davis Bank  in
Jennings, La.  Display binders on customer service desks in your
branch offices, along with posters touting imaging.  Also, have
customer service representatives show the binders to new customers and
to community organizations, Lyons recommended.

    Another tip:  Send customers neon-colored, "statement-stuffers"
with information about imaging and the available statement binders,
Lyons suggested.  Customers are less likely to discard brightly-
colored information before reading it.  (Dean Tingey, First National
