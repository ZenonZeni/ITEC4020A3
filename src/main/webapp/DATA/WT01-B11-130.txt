The track record of MNR is to achieve a protection level of 65% province-wide in old growth protection through forest management and other land use planning activities. Using this as a guideline, it is expected that the old growth red and white pine forested areas in the Temagami Planning Area will achieve this rate of protection.</B><P><BR><BR>


<B>RECOMMENDATION #27</B><P>

Council recommends that, following the finalization of the land use plan, a public education/communications plan be prepared to explain the approach that will be used by the Ministry of Natural Resources to manage old-growth Red and White Pine in the forest management plan identified in Recommendation #2.

<B>RECOMMENDATION #32</B><P>

Council recommends that a governance board be established to facilitate the implementation of the land use and resource management plans. The board would have greater authority than a local citizens committee and have representation from within and surrounding the planning area, including from the area's Aboriginal peoples.<P>

Council further recommends that the Ontario government continue to solicit the involvement of the local aboriginal community in the development and implementation of all future resource management plans.<P>

RESPONSE:

<B>Accept.<P>  The material collected by the CPC remains an important resource to the ministry.  As noted in response to recommendation #31, the government has recognized Aboriginal interests in its Response.</B><P><BR><BR>


<B>RECOMMENDATION #36</B><P>

RESPONSE:

<B>Accept in principle; to be undertaken in the future when budgetary resources permit. </B><P><BR><BR>


<B>RECOMMENDATION #37</B><P>

Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources, in concert with various partners, undertake steps to create greater public awareness about ecological sustainability and resource stewardship in the Temagami area, and the need to prevent the over-exploitation of the area's resources and values.<P>

<B>Accept.<P>  MNR's front-line focus is  on ensuring that Ontario's natural resources are used wisely and that ecosystems are managed sustainably. The MNR business plan helps meet those goals by enabling it to better set priorities, deliver core activities, and then measure results and outcomes.

MNR is focussing its core business activity on five key areas -- natural resource management; Crown land management; emergency response/enforcement; provincial parks management; and geographic information -- as part of a government-wide effort to eliminate the deficit, balance the provincial budget and create an improved economic climate that will stimulate and attract investment and create jobs.</B><P><BR><BR>


<B>RECOMMENDATION #38</B><P>

Council recommends that the Ministry of Natural Resources, in concert with various partners, prepare materials on various issues such as ecological sustainability, resource management, conservation ethics, conflict resolution, etc., as they relate to the Temagami area.
