TX JURY ORDERS HOUSTON LAW FIRM TO PAY $21.7M IN DAMAGES

     A Harris County, TX, jury on Aug. 15 awarded $21.7 million
in damages to the estate of a Houston oilman against the Houston
law firm of Vinson & Elkins on claims that the firm's gross
negligence generated millions of dollars in unnecessary
attorneys' fees and resulted in a $40 million loss of investment
income to the family (Moran et al. v. Vinson & Elkins, Harris
Cty., TX, Dist. Ct., No. 90-24849).

     The award consisted of $17.7 million in actual damages,
$1 million in punitive damages and $3 million in special damages.
The jury concluded that the firm had engaged in gross negligence;
breach of fiduciary duty for its own gain; civil conspiracy;
"false, misleading or deceptive acts"; and knowingly
"unconscionable action" in handling the estate.

     According to the complaint, William Moran died in November
1983, leaving an estate estimated to be worth $80 million, and
Vinson & Elkins (V&E) undertook representation of the estate
after another firm was forced to withdraw.  In addition to
representing the estate itself, V&E also represented the various
Moran companies, which were primarily in the oil and gas
business.

     The plaintiffs say that, from the beginning of V&E's
representation of the estate, the firm concealed a number of
conflicts of interest, including the fact that its managing
partner was a director and trust committee member of First City
Bancorporation of Texas, and that many V&E attorneys owned stock
in the bank.  In addition, the firm concealed negative financial
information about the bank and conspired to prolong the
administration of the estate so that the bank and V&E could
"continue to exploit the estate for excessive executor's and
attorneys' fees and expenses," said the plaintiffs.

     Other examples of V&E's negligence, the plaintiffs said,
included improper tax advice; business ventures which cost the
estate substantial amounts of money because V&E had "numerous
financial, professional and personal ties" with the companies
involved in the deals; and failure to reveal that First City was
"engaging in self-dealing by manipulating the maintenance of
short-term, low interest investment of estate assets."
               In its answer, V&E responded that (1) the plaintiffs lack
standing to sue because they lacked privity of contract with V&E;
and (2) the causes of action included in the complaint are not
assignable.  The firm counterclaimed that the suit was brought
for the purpose of harassment.

     The plaintiffs were represented by Brodus Spivey and Thomas
Prehoditch of Spivey, Grigg, Kelly & Knisely in Austin.  Counsel
for V&E were Richard Caldwell and Laura Ware of Mayor, Day,
Caldwell & Keeton in Houston.

CH. 11 EXAMINER CRITICAL OF LAW FIRM'S LACK OF DISCLOSURE

     In a report unsealed at the end of August, bankruptcy court-
appointed examiner Charles Stillman criticized Leslie Fay
Companies counsel Weil Gotshal & Manges for not being
disinterested while representing the estate and for not making
proper disclosure of conflicts of interest as mandated by the
Bankruptcy Code (In re: The Leslie Fay Companies, Inc., et al.;
SD NY Bank., No. 93 B 41724 (TLB)).

     Stillman concluded that, because the conflict in this case
arose from the appearance of impropriety rather than from actual
conduct harming the estates, the bankruptcy court should consider
as a sanction a limited disallowance of the legal fees incurred
by the firm, based on the cost of the investigation.

     According to the report, which was originally filed under
seal on May 27, Weil Gotshal was retained by Leslie Fay in
February 1993 to assist with an investigation of certain
accounting irregularities in the company's general ledger.  After
substantial losses in income were revealed as a result of the
investigation, Leslie Fay was no longer able to obtain financing
arrangements to operate its businesses, and filed for Chapter 11
protection in April 1993.  The bankruptcy court authorized Weil
Gotshal's employment as counsel to the Leslie Fay debtors.

     The issue of Weil Gotshal's disinterestedness was first
raised when the firm filed its application for fees.  The
creditors' committee and the trustee objected to the fee request,
saying that there were questions about the firm's disclosure of
its relationships with various parties related to Leslie Fay.
Stillman was appointed in December 1993.

     Stillman said that the pre-petition audit committee-related
relationships of Weil Gotshal included representation of Bear
Stearns and Odyssey Partners, several of whose employees were
members of the Leslie Fay audit committee.  He describes Weil
Gotshal's professional relationships with Bear Stearns and
Odyssey as "significant."  The examiner also stated that, at the
time Weil Gotshal was appointed as bankruptcy counsel, its
regular computerized conflicts-check was not performed, as the
company had already been representing the company for several
months.

     With respect to Weil Gotshal's post-petition
representations, Stillman said that the firm represented a number
of Leslie Fay directors in a securities class-action lawsuit and
government investigations which followed revelation of the
accounting problems at the company.  He investigated assertions
that Weil Gotshal's "insistence" on resolving the securities
fraud claims against officers and directors, which, in turn,
implicated officers' and directors' indemnification claims
against Leslie Fay, inhibited a prompt reorganization plan.  He
concluded that there was no documentary evidence to support
claims that Weil Gotshal's position was designed to further the
individual officers' and directors' interests to the detriment of
the estate.

     In preparing his reports, Stillman relied upon the
bankruptcy code 327 standard for the employment of professionals,
which requires that such professionals hold no interest adverse
to the estate and be disinterested persons, not just at the
beginning of their employ, but throughout the period of
employment.  He noted the difficulty of interpreting what
constitutes "adverse interest," as the code does not define the
phrase.  In considering the code's underlying policies, the
examiner said that counsel for the debtor need not always be
"perfectly disinterested": the test is one of materiality --
whether the firm had a material adverse interest.

     Turning to the judicial definition of "adverse interest" in
the context of multiple representations, Stillman reviewed
rulings of the First, Third and 10th Circuit Courts of Appeal, as
well as a number of bankruptcy courts.  He also considered
attorney codes of ethics with respect to the issues of exercise
of independent professional judgment, impaired judgment or
divided loyalties, and "avoiding even the appearance of
impropriety."

     Stillman concluded that Weil Gotshal's multiple
representations and relationships with respect to the Leslie Fay
debtors and the audit committee members and their related firms
constituted holding and representing materially adverse interests
in violation of Section 327(a).  In addition, he rejected the
firm's argument that it did not have to disclose those
connections because it did not consider them adverse to the
estate.

     Stillman said, "The firm's failure to disclose led to
significant burden and cost to the estates and put a cloud over
its representation....  [Its] failure to disclose frustrated an
important component of the bankruptcy system -- that a
professional's qualifications be evaluated at the outset so that
bankruptcy cases can proceed without any taint of partiality or
the appearance of partiality, of the professionals involved."

               Stillman is a partner in the New York City firm of Stillman,
Friedman & Shaw.

ZALE: AKIN GUMP LIABLE FOR MALPRACTICE FOR LBO-RELATED ACTIONS

     Jewel Recovery, L.P., Zale Corp.'s litigation entity, filed
suit on May 16 against its former law firm, Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer & Feld, and partner Alan Feld, charging the firm and Feld
with professional and gross negligence, aiding and abetting
breaches of fiduciary duty, fraud, fraudulent conveyance and
improper distribution of corporate dividends (In re Zale
Corporation, ND TX Bank., No. 392-30001-SAF-11; Jewel Recovery,
LP v. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld et al., No. 394-3335).

     According to the complaint, the defendants participated with
Peoples Jewelers Limited's directors Irving Gerstein, Charles
Gill and James Gillies in undertaking a number of post-LBO
transactions which resulted in severely reducing Zale's assets,
paying dividends to a shell entity and denuding a Zale affiliate.
Defendant Feld, who was a Zale Credit Corporation (ZCC) director,
is charged with conflicts of interest in his overlapping roles as
ZCC director and name partner of Akin Gump.

     The plaintiff characterizes Zale's 1989 $438 million LBO of
Gordon Jewelry Corporation as "the beginning of the end for the
Debtors," as the price was two to three times the value of the
company and the debt assumed by Gordon to finance the transaction
left Gordon insolvent.  Because Akin Gump acted as special
counsel to Zale in the acquisition, the firm knew or should have
known that the LBO would ruin Gordon financially, says Jewel.

     After the LBO was consummated, Akin Gump also represented
Gordon in connection with an offering of public debt,
representing that the company's projected earnings would grow
exponentially after the acquisition, says Jewel.  In addition,
although Zale was its client, Akin Gump allowed the company to
release People and Swarovski International Holding from
guarantees on notes which had been secured prior to the Gordon
LBO.  Toronto-based Peoples and Swarovski of Switzerland bought
Zale in 1986 for $640 million.

     With respect to the "denuding" of ZCC, Jewel claims that a
series of transactions at a time when Feld had the "ultimate
authority" to approve or disapprove ZCC's investments led, among
other blunders, to a disastrous investment in Gordon's
Receivables Trust, which was represented by Akin Gump, and ZCC's
payment in early 1991 of a $50 million "alleged dividend" to its
sole shareholder, Zale.

     Jewel claims that the defendants engaged in fraud in a stock
transaction in connection with the Gordon LBO, arguing that the
series of transactions which constituted the LBO involved stock
in a corporation, and, therefore, was a stock transaction as the
term is used in the Texas Business and Commerce Code.  "The
prospectus governing the issuance of the Gordon Senior Notes
presented unrealistic and fraudulent projections as truthful and
realistic...," and Akin failed to disclose the falsity of the
representations, says Jewel.

     The complaint also states that the legal fees paid to Akin
Gump for its representation of Gordon in the LBO were made
pursuant to and were an integral part of the LBO.  Jewel is
seeking recovery of the fees as fraudulent conveyances under the
Texas Business and Commerce Code because Gordon allegedly did not
receive reasonable equivalent value for Akin Gump's services, and
was insolvent at the time the fees were paid.

     Feld's breach of fiduciary duty as director of ZCC allegedly
resulted in $150 million in damages to Zale, says the complaint,
and his role in the improper distribution resulted in $50 million
in damages.  The damages proximately caused by the gross
negligence of the ZCC directors, including Feld's gross
negligence, is not less than $150 million, says Jewel.

     The complaint was filed by James McCarthy, David Kent and
David Roberts of Hughes & Luce in Dallas.

AR JUDGE DISMISSES ATTEMPT TO BLOCK SUBPOENA OF FIRM DOCUMENTS

     A federal judge in Little Rock, AR, on Aug. 10 dismissed as
premature a suit filed by the Rose Law Firm against the
Resolution Trust Corp. seeking to block a subpoena for documents
concerning all the firm's clients going back to 1985 (Rose Law
Firm v. Resolution Trust Corp. et al., ED AR, Western Div., Civ.
No. LR-C-94-21; see Andrews' Professional Liability LR, July
1994, P. 17).

     In making the decision, U.S. District Judge Henry Woods
"confess[ed] serious misgivings about the scope of this
subpoena...[which] demands the production of a broad range of
documents covering more than ten years."  He also said that the
Rose firm "was understandably disturbed by the scope of the
subpoena," with which it was expected to comply within 10 days.

     Nevertheless, the judge said that he was persuaded by the
position advanced by RTC and its Office of Inspector General
(OIG).

     The judge cited the following excerpt from OIG's brief:
"One of the most firmly established principles of administrative
law is that courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over attempts by
subpoena recipients to secure judicial review of administrative
agency subpoenas....  [T]he courts uniformly hold that such
challenges are not ripe for judicial review.  Since
administrative subpoenas are not self-executing, recipients of
such subpoenas can raise their procedural and substantive
objections, including objections to the validity of the
underlying investigation, only if and when the government seeks
to enforce its subpoena in court."

     Rose's managing partner, Ronald Clark, said the firm "will
not comply with the subpoena absent a court order."  He said that
the firm had not decided whether to appeal Judge Woods' ruling.

     RTC/OIG issued the subpoena in connection with an
investigation into possible "conflicts of interest" at the Rose
firm, where First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was once a partner.
The probe resulted from controversy over investments made by
President and Mrs. Clinton in the "Whitewater" planned resort
development when the president was governor of Arkansas.  The
Clintons' co-investor was the owner of the now-defunct Madison
Guaranty Savings & Loan Association of Little Rock.  The
development never got off the ground, and the Clintons
purportedly lost money on the deal.  Rose has acknowledged that
it represented the thrift in a few isolated matters but insisted
it was never the thrift's primary counsel.

     On April 26 of this year, Rose sued for a declaratory
judgment that the subpoena is void because it seeks information
protected by the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, and the Arkansas Rules of Professional Responsibility.
RTC argued that the Rose action was premature because the court
has not been asked by either RTC or OIG to enforce the subpoena.

     RTC is represented by Robert E. Craddock Jr. and Leslie
Gattas Coleman of Dyer, James and Taylor in Memphis, TN, and by
RTC staff counsel Jonathan B. Taylor in Washington, DC.  In
addition to Clark, Rose is represented by staff attorneys Jerry
C. Jones and David L. Williams, and by Walter B. Stuart and
Andrew J. Logan of Vinson & Elkins in Houston, TX.

CLIENT: FINANCIAL ADVISOR PROVIDED "ERRONEOUS" ADVICE

     Cleveland-based Figgie International filed suit on Aug. 26
against Boston Consulting Group, Inc., alleging that between 1991
and 1994 the management consultant breached its contract with
Figgie by providing "erroneous market studies and business
reports and by designing and implementing TBC programs which were
flawed" (Figgie International, Inc. v. Boston Consulting Group,
Inc., ND OH, No. 1:94 CV 1763).

     Figgie said, in addition, that Boston Consulting (BCG)
engaged in negligence, negligent misrepresentation and breach of
fiduciary duty.  Figgie is seeking "no less than" $2 million in
damages.

     According to the complaint, Figgie engaged BCG to develop a
series of management projects to generate business and market
information and time-based capability (TBC) programs for Figgie.
BCG allegedly promised that Figgie would realize "above-average
growth and maximum profitability within a three-year period of
time."  Under the engagement letter between the two parties, BCG
was supposed to establish a budget for each project and promised
that fees charged would not exceed the budget amount.  In spite
of BCG's assertions, says Figgie, there were no fixed fee billing
arrangements with BCG.

     The company says BCG breached its contract with Figgie by
(1) failing to deliver the accurate market studies and business
reports and the TBC programs and TBC results; and (2) by
consistently overbilling Figgie for services and expenses.  BCG's
negligence is evidenced by its (1) failure to use qualified and
appropriately supervised personnel; (2) failure to properly plan
and schedule the various consulting projects; and (3) failure to
execute the projects in a timely manner, the complaint contends.

     The complaint was filed by Richard Cusick, William Coughlin
and Anthony LaCerva of Calfee, Halter & Griswold in Cleveland.

HHC, OTHERS CLAIM FORMER FINANCIERS BETRAYED THEIR FIDUCIARY
OBLIGATIONS

     Hillsborough Holdings Corp., Walter Industries Inc.,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) and others on Sept. 8 filed
suit against financiers Leon Black and Marc J. Rowan, claiming
the two betrayed their fiduciary obligations by profiting from
information about Walter Industries gathered while representing
KKR (In re Hillsborough Holdings Corp., MD FL Bankr., Nos. 89-
9715-8P1 through 89-9746-8P1 and 90-11997-8P1; Hillsborough
Holdings Corp. et al. v. Black et al., Adv. No. 94-562).

     In their suit, the plaintiffs allege that Black and Rowan,
who served as investment bankers for KKR while at Drexel Burnham
Lambert, Inc., gleaned information collected during KKR's
acquisition of Jim Walter Corp., the predecessor to Walter
Industries.  The complaint further alleges that the two used that
information to gain a competitive advantage in bids on debt
securities issued by their former clients.

     "As a result," the complaint alleges, "defendants were able
to purchase at a steep discount more than $160 million face
amount of debt securities of the Debtors.  Consistent with
Black's pattern of behavior, defendants have now attempted to use
the position they have acquired in Walter Industries to take
control of the organization, by stepping in as controlling
shareholders."

     Black and Rowan acted as fiduciaries of Walters until it
filed for Chapter 11 in December 1989, and as fiduciaries of KKR
interests until Drexel collapsed in February 1990.  According to
the complaint, during that time, the two allegedly had access to
information not available to the public, such as hidden values in
Walter's $1.1 billion mortgage portfolio and projections about
Walter's future performance.  The complaint further alleges that
Black used this information when making his purchase of Walter
bonds under the guise of his new firm, Apollo Advisors.

     One of those acquisitions, completed in March 1992, was a
major portion of Walter's outstanding debt, $120,445,719 in face
amount of senior subordinated extendible reset notes, $25 million
in face amount of subordinated notes due 1996, $12.375 million in
face amount of pre-leveraged buyout debt of Walter and
$2.25 million in face amount of series B & C senior extendible
reset notes.

     Black has filed one of two plans of reorganization for
Walter, his competing with one filed by the debtor.  Both plans
provide for payment in full of all secured claims and allowed
amounts of unsecured claims, including unsecured debt and trade
creditor claims.  Both are pending approval by the bankruptcy
court.

     "The Apollo Plan constitutes the final step in enabling the
Apollo Fiduciaries to consummate Black's original strategy to
utilize the confidential and proprietary valuable information
obtained from Walter Industries and the KKR Interests to obtain
control of Walter Industries and squeeze out the equity interests
of the KKR Interests and management," the complaint alleges.

     In this adversary proceeding, the plaintiffs are seeking
affirmative relief for breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation
of confidential business information and conversion.

     The complaint was filed by Michael Armstrong of Kirkpatrick
& Lockhart in New York City; by Don Stichter of Stichter, Riedel,
Blain & Prosser in Tampa; by Leonard Gilbert of Carlton, Fields,
Ward, Emmanuel, Smith & Cutler in Tampa; and by Philip Howard of
Howard, Darby, & Levin in New York City.

RELIANCE-ON-COUNSEL DEFENSE WAIVES PRIVILEGE, JUDGE RULES

     Even if defendant officers and directors do not always waive
an attorney-client privilege by generally asserting reliance on
counsel's advice as a general defense against reckless conduct
charges, they must produce communications relating to narrow
areas where the substance of the documents was injected into the
case through their specific statements of reliance, said a
federal judge in Wilmington Aug. 5  (In re ML-Lee Acquisition
Fund II, L.P. et al., D DE, No. 92-60).

     The suit claimed that ML-Lee Acquisition Fund II L.P. and
ML-Lee Acquisition Fund (Retirement Accounts) used false and
misleading claims to deceive those who bought limited partnership
interests in the funds between Nov. 10, 1989, and Jan. 5, 1990.
In addition to the federal securities law claims, the suit
asserted three causes of action that arise under Delaware law --
breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and fraud and
deceit.

     In an April 1 opinion, U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Farnan
allowed plaintiffs to proceed with a private right of action
under the Investment Company Act but barred them from bringing
aider and abettor charges against the advisors and allies of the
corporate and individual defendants under that statute.

     At the same time, the judge denied plaintiffs' motion to
compel the production of certain evidence withheld on the basis
of attorney-client privilege.  The court declined to decide that
defendants waived the privilege simply by stating during
depositions that they failed to take certain actions based on
advice of counsel, but it cautioned that if it found that
defendants were using the privilege as a shield to liability or
subsequently raised a reliance-on-counsel defense, the motion to
compel would be granted.

     Subsequently, plaintiffs contended that in answering an
amended complaint, defendants specifically relied on advice of
counsel in claiming that they believed in good faith that certain
transactions were well founded.

     "A client may waive the privilege by disclosure of some
privileged communication...or by asserting reliance upon the
advice of counsel as an essential element of his defense," the
court wrote.  Even if defendants are correct that simply denying
allegations of reckless conduct or generally asserting reliance
on counsel is not sufficient to waive the attorney-client
privilege, the court said, "In order for plaintiffs to have a
fair and adequate opportunity to test and rebut defendants'
allegations that they sought advice from counsel, plaintiffs are
entitled to know, for example whether the Lee defendants
disclosed all material facts to counsel, whether counsel gave an
otherwise well-informed opinion, [and whether] the Lee defendants
follow[ed] the advice from counsel."

     "Even if the Lee defendants intended only to rely on the act
of seeking advice from counsel to show they behaved in good
faith, plaintiffs are entitled to test the validity and sincerity
of that action," the court concluded.

     The court noted that the officers and directors specifically
stated that they relied on the advice of counsel as to certain
legal definitions, compliance with laws and fulfillment of
fiduciary duties -- responses which reach beyond simply denying
reckless conduct.

     As to the scope of the waiver, Judge Farnan noted that
defendants' assertions as to their reliance on counsel were very
specific and very narrow:  "Therefore, the defendants are
compelled to produce only those communications relating to the
specific areas in which defendants have asserted reliance on the
advice of counsel."

     Plaintiffs are represented by Pamela Tikellis, Carolyn D.
Mack and Cynthia Calder of Chimicles, Burt, Jacobsen & McNew in
Wilmington; Michael Freed and Carol Gilden of Much, Shelist,
Freed, Denenberg & Ament in Chicago; and William French, Robert
Gegios and Glen Lavy of Gibbs, Roper, Loots & Williams in
Milwaukee.

     The Merrill defendants are represented by Kenneth Nachbar of
Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell in Wilmington; and James
Benedict, Mark Holland, David Lewittes, Martin Seidel, Laura
Icken, James Moyle and Jeffrey Nanes of Rogers & Wells in New
York City.

     Certain ML-Lee defendants are represented by Stephen
Herrmann of Richards Layton & Finger in Wilmington and by Sanford
Remz and Richard Nicholson of Hutchins, Wheeler & Dittmar in
Boston.

     Other ML-Lee defendants are represented by Michael Goldman
and Stephen Norman of Potter, Anderson & Corroon in Wilmington
and John Donovan Jr. and Michael Fee of Ropes & Gray in Boston.

     Hutchins, Wheeler & Dittmar is represented by David McBride
and Bruce Stargatt of Young, Conaway, Stargatt & Taylor in
Wilmington; and Brackett Denniston III, Anthony Downs and Todd
Hahn of Goodwin, Procter & Hoar in Boston.

     Two banks which lost "several million dollars" on a loan
default can sue the borrower's accountant for negligent and
intentional misrepresentation, ruled the U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts on Aug. 8, denying summary judgment
to the public accounting firm (Fleet National Bank et al. v. The
Gloucester Corporation, et al., D MA, No. 92-11812-REK).

     Based on its reading of the Restatement of Torts, the court
concluded that a jury could find that the accounting firm, "in
the course of its profession, supplied information in the form of
audit reports to [the borrower], with substantial certainty that
those reports would be supplied by [the borrower] to and relied
upon by the banks in deciding whether to extend credit to [the
borrower]."

     Plaintiff banks, Fleet National Bank and Cooperatieve
Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank (collectively, banks) filed
suit against Tonneson & Co. (Tonneson) to recover loan balances
outstanding when The Gloucester Corporation (TGC) defaulted on
multi-million dollar loans made in reliance on the "faulty"
audits and misstatements made by Tonneson.  Prior to the filing
of the suit, Tonneson had audited the financial statements of the
now-defunct TGC in 1989 and 1990.

     Tonneson argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law because under the tests most frequently applied by courts
both in and out of Massachusetts for determining whether
accounting firms owe a duty of care to persons with whom they are
not in privity, Tonneson owed no such duty to the banks.
Tonneson contends that the firm itself did not send the audited
financial statements to the banks; that the banks never
questioned Tonneson about the audited statements; and no one even
actually confirmed to Tonneson that the audited financial
statements had in fact been furnished to the banks.

     The court first noted that, although neither the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) nor the Massachusetts
Appeals Court has decided the question of whether a CPA owes a
duty of care to persons with whom the CPA is not in privity, the
SJC had issued a series of opinions involving liability of other
professionals to persons with whom they were not in privity.  The
court distinguished the roles of professionals such as lawyers
and doctors who are retained to provide services solely to the
persons who retained them, and CPAs who are "often engaged to
conduct an audit for the purpose of providing information --
indeed assurances -- to third parties."

     After a review of appropriate Massachusetts cases, the court
outlined four "guiding principles" for dealing with the issue of
potential unlimited liability under that state's law:  (1) the
defendant must have been hired to perform a particular task;
(2) performance of the task must have been for the benefit of a
particular person known to the defendant; (3) the plaintiff must
have had a reasonable expectation that the defendant would
perform the task in a manner such that the plaintiff should have
escaped the harm that befell him or her; and (4) the defendants
should have foreseen that the plaintiff or someone in his or her
position would be harmed in a manner and to the extent that the
plaintiff was harmed as a result of the defendant's negligence.

     Turning to non-Massachusetts precedent, the court determined
that three tests were applicable to the instant case:  the
foreseeability test, the near-privity test and the Restatement
test.  The court concluded that the SJS would probably not adopt
the foreseeability test, because so few other jurisdictions have
adopted it.   The court reached the same conclusion with respect
to the privity or near-privity test, on grounds of policy and
uncertainty of application, although the parties informed the
court that 14 jurisdictions have adopted that test.

     Finally, the court observed that the Restatement (Second) of
Torts test, which holds accountants and other professionals
liable for providing false information, justifiably relied upon
by others, when substantial harmful consequences are likely to
result, has been accepted by "at least" 19 jurisdictions, and
"seems to comport best with the Massachusetts cases that have
addressed the subject of professional liability in the absence of
privity."  That is, the Restatement test "limits the ambit of
accountant liability to an individual or a narrow class and
includes in the definition of 'intent' any consequence that the
accountant is 'substantially certain' will result from his or her
negligent misrepresentation," and thus "approaches the actual
knowledge standard of several Massachusetts cases, without adding
a linkage requirement that appears wholly foreign to
Massachusetts case law," it said.

     From a policy perspective, the Restatement test also
provides for proportionality, predictability, uniformity and
flexibility, said the court.

ND GA ENTERS PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR LBO ADVISOR

     U.S. District Court Judge G. Ernest Tidwell has entered
partial summary judgment orders on some of the claims brought by
Munford, Inc. against its LBO financial advisor in a 1991
$68 million adversary proceeding filed by the company to recover
corporate assets allegedly lost as a result of the 1988 leveraged
buyout of the company (In re Munford, Inc., ND GA Bankr., No. 90-
00078SWC; Munford v. Munford, No. 91-6417).

     Judge Tidwell adopted the bankruptcy court's findings and
dismissed breach of contract/negligence, fraudulent conveyance
and aiding and abetting claims against Shearson Lehman Brothers.

     The dispute arose from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Munford,
Inc, and the 1989 LBO which preceded it.  The 1991 adversary
complaint includes claims against a variety of participants in
the LBO, including Shearson, who was retained by Munford, Inc. in
1987 to evaluate the company's future.  Shearson concluded that a
sale of 100% of Munford's common stock would maximize shareholder
value, and that a leveraged buyout or leveraged recap would not
successfully maximize shareholder value.  Shearson also prepared
an offering memorandum to solicit potential purchasers for the
company and, later, an opinion indicating that the price offered
for Munford stock in the LBO was fair to the company's
shareholders.

     Shearson was charged with malpractice, negligence, breach of
contract and breach of fiduciary duty because the "firm failed to
counsel Munford carefully and completely concerning the financial
condition" of pre-LBO Munford, the value of its assets, the
financial effects of the LBO on Munford and the anticipated
insolvency of the company as a consequence of the LBO, the
company said.

     Munford also claimed that the $250,000 in fees paid to
Shearson were fraudulent conveyances and should be set
aside, and that the firm is also guilty of aiding and abetting a
breach of fiduciary duty by the company's board of directors.
The complaint alleges that Shearson learned of the "continuing
decline of Munford's operations" and that the company would be
rendered insolvent as a result of the LBO, but assisted the
directors in consummating the LBO anyway.

     In two April 4 opinions, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Cotton
recommended that the separate motions for summary judgment filed
by the DFA Entities and certain former Munford officer/directors
be denied, and that Shearson's motion be granted as to three
counts in the complaint.  Judge Tidwell modified in an Aug. 4
order.

     First, Judge Tidwell agreed with Judge Cotton that Munford's
claims of professional negligence, breach of contract, fraudulent
conveyance and aiding and abetting against Shearson should be
dismissed.  He said that Munford's failure to come forward with
expert testimony on the issue of the standard of care to be
exercised by a professional warranted dismissal of the negligence
allegation.  He noted that, while simple negligence claims do not
require expert testimony, assertions of professional negligence
can be established "only by professional or expert testimony."

     The court rejected Munford's contention that it was entitled
to rely on testimony by Shearson representatives to establish the
relevant standard of care, concluding that the testimony at issue
related to Shearson's contractual duty to Munford, and did not
establish an opinion about a general standard of care.

     With respect to Munford's claim that Shearson aided and
abetted the officer/director defendants' alleged breach of duty
to Munford, Judge Tidwell concluded that the bankruptcy court
correctly determined that Georgia law does not recognize that
tort, and that a Georgia court faced with the issue would not be
likely to create such a cause of action.  He observed that, in
view of the fact that fiduciary duties "are based on the special
relationship existing between two or more parties," the
imposition of aider and abettor liability for breaches of
fiduciary duty essentially extends fiduciary obligations beyond
the scope of the confidential or special relationship.

2ND CIR. REJECTS CHALLENGE TO MERRILL LYNCH FINANCING OFFER

     A suit claiming that Merrill Lynch, in connection with its
orchestration of the 1988 LBO of Texas-based Insilco Corporation,
participated in the distribution of securities through a
materially misleading prospectus and registration statement is
barred by the statute of limitations, said the Second Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 12 (Jackson National Life Insurance
Company v. Merrill Lynch & Co. Ins. et al., 2nd Cir., No. 93-
9287).

     The panel concluded that, even if the initial prospectus was
misleading, the warnings in the prospectus and the subsequent
offering memorandum put the plaintiff on inquiry notice of the
fraud more than one year before the tolling date.

     Insilco Corporation underwent an LBO in August 1988 and, as
a result, took on debt that included approximately $405 million
in "bridge financing" provided by Merrill Lynch to ensure the
deal's success.  The terms of the bridge loan required Insilco to
engage in a public offering of high-yield "junk" bonds and
warrants and to use the proceeds to repay the bridge financing
provided by Merrill Lynch.  Plaintiff Jackson National Life
Insurance Company (Jackson) responded to Merrill Lynch's
solicitation by purchasing nearly $8 million in principal amount
of Insilco securities in January 1989.

     In May 1990, Insilco embarked upon a recapitalization and
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an offering
memorandum which updated the company's financial condition.  The
recap plan failed and Insilco filed for Chapter 11 protection in
January 1991.

     Jackson filed suit against Merrill Lynch under 11 and 12(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933 and 20A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, alleging three material misstatements or omissions:
(1) the prospectus falsely indicated that the January 1989
offering was being conducted on an "all or none" basis when
Merrill Lynch knew all the securities could not be sold to the
public; (2) the prospectus failed to disclose that the "qualified
independent underwriter" was not informed that the offering would
not be conducted on an "all or none" basis because there was no
public market for the entire offering; and (3) the prospectus
failed to warn that the LBO had rendered Insilco insolvent before
the offering took place.

     In addition to declaring the suit barred by the statute of
limitations, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York also held that Jackson did not state a claim under 20A
of the 1934 Act because it did not plead a predicate violation of
the 1934 Act as that section requires.

     The Second Circuit panel affirmed in an opinion by Judge
John Walker.

     First, said Judge Walker, the statute of limitations
applicable to Jackson's 1933 Act claims is one year "after the
discovery of the untrue statement of omission, or after such
discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable
diligence.... [emphasis in the original]."  He concluded that
Jackson had at its disposal the facts from which it could have
discovered the misstatement it alleges more than one year before
the tolling date.

     Beginning with Jackson's "all or none" claims, Judge Walker
said that, among the "early storm warnings" available to alert
Jackson that the Merrill Lynch offering was not an "all or none"
offering was the fact that (1) the prospectus contained no
provisions for escrow accounts and refund arrangements; (2) the
1989 Insilco offering was conducted by Merrill Lynch on a "firm
commitment" basis; and (3) the May 1990 offering memorandum
circulated in connection with the recap revealed that Merrill
Lynch "currently" owned about 50% of the securities offered in
1989 and that only a "limited" market for the securities had
developed.

     The court said that, even if it assumed that the ambiguous
language in the prospectus "unmistakably gave the misleading
impression that the offering was being conducted on an all or
none basis, the aggregate of circumstances in the case was
sufficient to put a reasonable investor on notice that the
underwriting was not to be conducted on an all or none basis."

     Turning to Jackson's insolvency claim, Judge Walker observed
that the reasonableness of Jackson's reliance on statements of
Insilco's solvency in the prospectus to support its claim that it
could not have known of an imminent bankruptcy "must be assessed
against the actual language of the prospectus."  The solvency
opinion in the prospectus was contingent on future events,
primarily the ability to generate increased operating income,
over which Insilco had only limited control, said the court, and
was followed by the statement "no assurance could be given that a
court would confirm the company's position with respect to the
solvency issues."

     Judge Walker said additional evidence of potential
insolvency can be found in the prospectus' financial information,
which showed the impact of the LBO on the company's finances and
disclosed that the company's high debt-to-equity ratio resulting
from the LBO might adversely affect the company's ability to meet
principal and interest payments as they came due.  In addition,
the offering memorandum 16 months later revealed that Insilco was
experiencing severe cash flow problems which might render it
unable to meet its current liabilities, the court said.

     Finally, Judge Walker addressed Jackson's claim under 20A,
which has a five-year statute of limitations, and rejected
Jackson's contention that it should be allowed to proceed under
20A for violations of 11 and 12(2) of the 1933 Act because
remedies of the 1933 and 1934 Acts were "meant to be cumulative,
not exclusive."  The court said that the language of Section 20A
makes it clear that "Congress sought to alter the remedies
available in insider trading cases and only in insider trading
cases [emphasis in the original]."

     Jackson was represented by Raymond Levites, Richard Cashman
and Diane Britton of Pavelic & Levites.  Counsel for Merrill
Lynch were Jack Auspitz, Debra Freeman and Claire Silberman of
Morrison & Foerster.  Both firms are located in New York City.

10TH CIR. HOLDS CLAIMS AGAINST CONSULTANT NOT RELATED TO ERISA

     A panel of the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held
June 30 that the state law claims of trustees of an ERISA-
governed plan against a negligent outside consultant were not
preempted because none of the claims related closely enough to
the plan  (Airparts Company, Inc. et al. v. Custom Benefit
Services of Austin, Inc., 10th Cir., No. 93-3268).

     The decision reversed and remanded a ruling by the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas which dismissed the
complaint brought by Airparts Company, Inc. against defendant
Custom Benefit Services of Austin, Inc., d/b/a First Actuarial
Corp. (FAC), on the grounds that their state law claims were
preempted by ERISA.

     The plaintiffs, co-trustees of an ERISA-governed plan,
brought state law claims of negligence, implied indemnity and
common law fraud against FAC, a firm hired by the plaintiffs to
provide expert benefit plan consultation.  Specifically, the
plaintiffs alleged that FAC failed to give timely advice to
Airparts on the effects of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1987, improperly calculated pension benefits, proposed and
drafted a useless plan amendment and deliberately concealed the
cost of the amendment and its eventual uselessness from the
plaintiffs.

     In an opinion delivered by Judge Oliver Seth, the panel held
that the state law claims put forth by Airparts did not relate to
an ERISA plan and therefore were not preempted.  The state laws
involved in the case, the panel said, did not regulate the type
of benefits or terms of the plan; they did not create reporting,
disclosure, funding or vesting requirements for the plan; they
did not affect the calculation of benefits; and they were not
common law rules designed to rectify faulty plan administration.

     "Plaintiffs' state law claims against FAC do not have and
will not have any effect whatsoever on the relations among the
traditional plan entities," the panel said.  "Those principals,
the employer, the plan, the plan fiduciaries, and the
beneficiaries, are united in their efforts to secure redress from
defendants.  A recovery from defendants will increase the coffers
of the plan; a defeat will mean that the plan has expended money
in fruitless litigation.  Such a tangential effect, however, is
not enough to relate these state law claims to the plan itself."

     Continuing, the panel held that Airparts' claims would not
affect the structure, administration or the type of benefits
provided by the ERISA-governed plan.  In addition, the panel
noted that the plaintiffs made no claim based on any rights under
the plan and there was no allegation that any of the plan's terms
had been breached.  Also, there was no effort to enforce or
modify the terms of the plan and there was no threat that, by
allowing the suit to go forward, conflicting regulations would
emerge which would destroy the structural unity of the ERISA
scheme.

     Moreover, the panel said that the plan administrator in this
case was Airparts, not FAC.  FAC was simply an outside consultant
which did not directly perform any administrative act vis-a-vis
the plan, it said.  Addressing congressional purpose in enacting
ERISA, the panel said that it saw "no congressional purpose to be
furthered by denying an ERISA plan a state cause of action
against allegedly negligent third-party service providers."

 Carparts Co. is represented by Paul Arabia in Wichita, KS.
Counsel for Custom Benefit Services is Joseph H. Bocock and
Michael F. Lauderdale in Oklahoma City, OK.

HOLDERS TELL COURT THAT ANY FISCAL CONFLICT BARS DISINTEREST

     Contrary to the position taken by the Delaware Chancery
Court and defendant directors of Western Airlines Inc., the
Western board could not rely on the recommendations of its
financial advisor for a merger decision because, in this context,
any fiscal conflict of interest, no matter what the source,
removes independence and disinterest, plaintiff shareholders
argued to the Delaware Supreme Court in a brief filed July 26
(Rand et al. v. Western Airlines Inc., DE Sup. Ct., No. 94-94).

     Frederick Rand, seeking to represent other shareholders of
Western Airlines, challenged the price at which the airline was
acquired by Delta.  The suit alleged that due to their corporate
positions, the individual defendants had information -- which
they allegedly withheld from the class -- that would indicate
that Western was worth substantially more than the preshare price
offered, especially considering its synergy value.

     Rand charged that the Western board breached its duty of
care by allegedly agreeing to a stock option pact with Delta as
well as a no-shop and no-talk pact as part of the merger
agreement.  He claimed that in return for lucrative golden
parachutes, Western's board violated its Revlon duty to seek the
best value for shareholders once it became apparent that the
company would change hands.  The suit alleged that the board did
not even seek an opinion from an independent adviser on the
fairness of the Delta offer.

     In a Sept. 11, 1989, opinion, Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger
dismissed Delta but found that two claims against Western's
directors and officers could not be resolved on a motion to
dismiss:  (1) the Revlon claim that the board failed to auction
the company; and (2) a disclosure claim that the directors
violated their duty of complete candor by withholding information
on the true value of the company.

               On defendants' motion for summary judgment, the vice
chancellor, in a Feb. 25 opinion, found reason to dismiss those
claims.  Although an "enhanced scrutiny" standard must be applied
here, "the essential question remains whether a disinterested
board has satisfied its duty to act on a fully informed basis,"
the court stated.  Nor was the existence of golden parachute
provisions for three of Western's chief negotiators enough to
question their independence, the court said.

     In their opening brief, Rand said that, contrary to the law,
the lower court had, on a motion for summary judgment, "refused
to draw a single inference in plaintiffs' favor."  For instance,
as to duty of loyalty, appellants argued:  "A director is not
independent if he can reasonably anticipate special benefits
flowing from the transaction submitted to the board for its
approval,...[but the chancery court] improperly overlaid an
additional element in determining the existence of divided
loyalty."

     In reply, Western contended that the chancery court had
properly held that the Western board satisfied its Revlon duties
in approving the merger agreement by (1) canvassing the market
and contacting virtually every airline about the possibility of a
merger, acquisition, or joint marketing agreement;
(2) considering the severe disadvantages it faced in a newly regulated
market; and (3) considering the extensive work performed by fincancial
advisor Dillon Reed.
    Since Delta was the only offer to come forward after a 15-month
search, Western contended, the court properly concluded that the price
Western's board obtained was only not fair but the highest price
possible.
    In their reply brief, plaintiffs argued that at the very least,
they have shown that there is a question of material fact that would
preclude summary judgment as to both duty of care and loyalty charges.
Both the chancery court and defendants miss the point
point in pointing to the fact that Dillon Reed did not have to
back the disputed merger to get its bonus, they said.  "Dillon
was highly motivated to recommend a transaction rather than
suggest that Western continue as an ongoing enterprise,"
plaintiffs said, and, since time was running out, the contested
deal was the only practical way to get that money.

     Defendants' contention that a previous higher offer was
subject to conditions and thus not material is unsupported by
authority and flies in the face of common knowledge that most
such offers are at the outset subject to numerous conditions,
appellants argued in support of their assertion that the board
did not pursue alternatives.  Nor can it be concluded summarily
that Western gained a substantial benefit that justified the
lock-up and no-shop provisions, appellants said.

     "Defendants do not deny the financial interest of Western's
negotiators," appellants asserted.  "Rather they seem to say that
such a conflict is permissible so long as the financially
conflicted party did not initiate the set of circumstances
leading to the conflict.  To the contrary, it is cut and dried
that a director who receives a substantial benefit from
supporting a transaction cannot be objectively viewed as
disinterested or independent.  The Chancery Court recognized that
conflict but disregarded its importance."

     Even if none of these elements are a litmus test for breach
of duty, they create, at the very least, a question that can only
be decided at trial, appellants said.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and Kevin
Gross of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington, DE;
and by Roger Kirby of Kaufman, Malchman, Kirby & Squire in New
York City.  Defendants are represented by Charles Richards Jr.
and Allen Terrell of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington; and

11TH CIR.: INTRODUCING BROKER, AGENT CANNOT COMPEL ARBITRATION

     An introducing broker/dealer and its agent were not third-
party beneficiaries of an arbitration agreement between the
plaintiff and a clearing broker and, therefore, cannot compel
arbitration of the plaintiff's securities, common law fraud,
breach of fiduciary obligation and, under the Texas Deceptive
Trade Practices-Consumer Act, negligence and conspiracy claims
against them, said the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Aug. 19 (Taylor v. Investors Associates, Inc., et al., 11th Cir.,
No. 93-5049).

     The panel said that the defendants did not qualify as third-
party beneficiaries because an intent to benefit them was not
apparent from the construction of the arbitration agreement "in
light of all surrounding circumstances."

     According to court documents, co-defendant Mitchell
Goldberg, as agent for co-defendant Investors Associates, Inc.
(IAI), solicited plaintiff Don Taylor to buy and sell stock from
IAI.  On Jan. 6, 1992, Taylor purchased stock through IAI and,
the next day, signed a client's agreement with Prudential-Bache
Securities, which was to serve as clearing broker in the trading
arrangement.

     Taylor subsequently filed suit against IAI and Goldberg,
alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; Rule 10(b)(5); Section 12(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933; Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO); Texas Blue Sky Law; Texas Business and Commerce Code and
the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act.  The defendants
moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration or dismiss the
action.

     The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
concluded that the defendants could not compel arbitration, and
the appeals court panel affirmed in a per curiam opinion, which
adopted the trial court's decision.

     In his opinion below, U.S. District Judge William Justice
first noted that the arbitration clause did not mention IAI or
Goldberg by name or function, nor did those parties sign the
document.  Judge Justice rejected the defendants' contention that
they were included as parties to the pact through the use of
"you" (referring to Prudential) in the client's agreement,
because IAI allegedly supplied Taylor with the agreement.

     Second, Judge Justice said that the intent of the parties to
the arbitration agreement was manifest -- to arbitrate claims by
or against the clearing house concerning its handling of Taylor's
account.  In addition, a letter from Prudential, explaining that
it was not Taylor's broker, but his broker's clearing firm, makes
it clear that the defendants were independent from Prudential,
said the judge.

     Third, the defendants cannot rely on agency principles to
support their argument that they are entitled to enforce the
arbitration agreement, said the court.  Unlike the fact
situations in the cases cited by the defendants, here, the
disputed transaction did not involve the liquidation of stock
whereby the clearing house's services were employed, which might
make the clearing house a party to the suit, Judge Justice noted.
No claims in the suit pertain to Prudential's or Taylor's
accounts there, he said, and, hence, there was no contingent
right for the introducing broker to invoke the arbitration
agreement.

     Finally, with respect to the defendants' third-party
beneficiary argument, the defendants are not mentioned in the
arbitration agreement, and no consent to arbitration with
Goldberg or IAI may be implied based solely on the relationship
between the introducing broker and the clearing house, said the
court.

2ND CIR. REVERSES FINDING FOR CARRIER ON PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY

     The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 8 by a 2-1
margin overturned a summary judgment for an insurer on the
coverage demands of a lawyer policyholder, finding that the
policy language of the professional liability policy in issue
that disclaims coverage "for the return of or restitution of
legal fees, costs and expenses" is ambiguous with respect to
claims involving fees paid to third parties (McCostis v. Home
Insurance Co. of Indiana, 2nd Cir., No. 93-9283).

               The insured, Richard M. McCostis, was a partner in the firm
of McCostis & Lind and also served as director, secretary and
outside general counsel of Barr Laboratories.  In September 1990,
Barr became a client of the law firm of Winston & Strawn.

     Winston & Strawn subsequently named McCostis and ex-W&S
partner Lawrence Fox to a lawsuit that alleged that the two
attorneys conspired to overbill Barr for upwards of $756,000.  Of
this amount, McCostis allegedly pocketed $335,000 and Fox
received the balance.  W&S' suit against the lawyers was grounded
in RICO, common law fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.  W&S
reimbursed Barr for its loss and received an assignment of rights
as against McCostis and Fox.

     McCostis tendered the claim to his professional liability
carrier, Home Insurance Co. of Indiana.  Home initially assumed
the defense, but disclaimed coverage based on the policy
definition of damages which specifically excluded claims "for the
return of or restitution of legal fees, costs and expenses."

     McCostis lodged a declaratory judgment suit in the Southern
District of New York.  The trial court granted summary judgment
to the carrier, determining that the suit against McCostis was
essentially for the return of legal fees and expenses.

     McCostis argued on appeal that since the complaint alleged
that he only received $335,000, but seeks to recover the full
amount embezzled, Winston & Strawn are seeking some element of
damages as well as the return of the funds.  The insured also
argued that the policy also specifically covers claims for
negligent breach of fiduciary duty.

     In reversing, the Second Circuit found that the policy
language did "not provide a clear answer to the question of
whether the return or restitution of legal fees exclusion would
be applicable for disputes concerning fees paid to third
parties."  The panel wrote that "the use of the words 'return'
and 'restitution' seems to indicate that the exclusion would
pertain only to situations where the insured received the
disputed funds and is forced to repay the monies to the client."

     The panel vacated and remanded with instructions to the
Southern District to consider extrinsic evidence (if any) that
would demonstrate the actual intent of the parties.

     U.S. Circuit Judge George C. Pratt authored the majority
opinion, in which U.S. Circuit Judge John M. Walker Jr. joined.
Senior U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley of the Southern
District of New York, sitting by designation, issued a one-line
dissent.

ED MI REJECTS EQUITABLE SUBROGATION IN ATTORNEY MALPRACTICE CASE

     A federal judge in Detroit on July 11 rejected an insurer's
effort to use equitable subrogation to justify a malpractice suit
against attorneys whom the insurer had selected to defend its
policyholder, finding that the insurer had lost all subrogation
rights when its policyholder dismissed the malpractice claim with
prejudice (Preferred Risk Mutual Insurance Company v. Hoiby et
al., No. 93-CV-71397-DT).

     Allstate Car Leasing Corporation was sued in state court
automobile negligence litigation after a 1979 accident.  Allstate
was insured under a $250,000 liability policy issued by plaintiff
Preferred.  Preferred retained the defendant lawyers, Eugene
Hoiby and Robert Kanter, to represent the Allstate.  After two
trials, the case was settled when Preferred paid $1.3 million.

     Before the settlement, Allstate had sued Preferred and the
lawyers, alleging bad faith by the insurer and professional
negligence by the lawyers, including failure of the lawyers to
keep it fully informed, failure to solicit a settlement and
negligently directing the defense of the underlying tort
litigation.  After the $1.3 million settlement was reached, the
owner stipulated to dismissal of its malpractice and bad faith
complaint with prejudice.

     However, Preferred then filed a diversity-based legal
malpractice complaint in the Eastern District of Michigan.  The
lawyers moved for summary judgment.

     Judge George E. Woods granted the defense motion.

     In general, an insurer may use the doctrine of equitable
subrogation -- rather than rely on a direct attorney-client
relationship -- to pursue a malpractice claim against lawyers it
retained for its policyholder, he said.  Because subrogation
gives the insurer only rights owed to the policyholder, defense
counsel's loyalties are not compromised by the equitable
subrogation approach, he said.

     In this case, however, the policyholder already had agreed
to dismiss its own malpractice claim with prejudice, and
Preferred had consented to that dismissal with a purported
reservation of its own rights.  Woods found that purported
reservation of rights to be ineffective, though; Preferred, as a
subrogee, cannot maintain the malpractice claim that its
policyholder already had relinquished.

WD MI: MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS VOID MALPRACTICE POLICY

     Whether a psychologist's purportedly material
misrepresentations in an application and renewal application for
a professional liability policy void the policies ab initio can
be resolved in a federal declaratory judgment action, a judge in
Grand Rapids, MI, has ruled.  A single decision on whether there
is an insurance contract under which the psychologist can demand
defense and indemnification for sexual assault and related claims
will resolve the issue for a number of active and prospective
state tort suits, according to the July 15 decision  (Chicago
Insurance Co. v. Regt et al., WD MI, No. :93-CV-764).

     Chicago Insurance Co. issued malpractice policies to John M.
Regt, Ph.D., for 1991 and 1992.  In 1993, the intervening
codefendants filed state court complaints alleging sexual abuse,
negligence and breach of the policyholder's professional standard
of care.  The policyholder filed for bankruptcy.

     The insurer then filed a diversity-based declaratory
judgment complaint in the Western District of Michigan, alleging
that the misrepresentations made the policies invalid and
unenforceable.  The intervening codefendants in turn filed state
court declaratory judgment complaints against the plaintiff and
another insurer that is not a party to the federal action.

     The intervening codefendants moved for summary judgment or
dismissal of the federal action on the pleadings, citing the
pending state court litigation.

     U.S. Judge Robert Holmes Bell denied the motion, ruling that
a federal judgment would clarify and settle the legal relations
between the insurer and its policyholder and would afford relief
from the uncertainty, insecurity and controversy giving rise to
the proceeding.

     A declaratory judgment would settle the controversy without
requiring any evidence about the policyholder's alleged
professional misconduct and negligence that are at the core of
the state litigation, Bell ruled.  It would apply both to the
pending suits and any future tort actions against the
policyholder, he said.  The judgment also would clarify the
insurer's obligations, the court wrote.

     Judge Bell found no evidence that the insurer had initiated
the declaratory judgment action for procedural fencing or to
provide an arena for res judicata.  Nor would a declaratory
judgment increase friction between state and federal courts
because a decision on coverage would not depend on a factual
record in the underlying tort litigation, he said.

     Although the state court could decide the issue, the issues
in the tort actions are different, he said, and a resolution of
insurance coverage does not depend on or have any legal affect on
a state court declaratory action against another insurer.
Because there is no duplication of factual or legal issues, a
state court would not necessarily present a better or more
effective remedy, he said.
