<p><font size="4">Hello, dear Jeffery, and hearty greetings to
all you meet; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Thank you for the invigorating note that you most recently sent
to me and especially appreciate your saintly remembrance of Brian
and your thoughtful communication to him.&nbsp; I hope you are
aware that he is no longer in McKean FCI.&nbsp; He was accused of
inciting a riot there last October when the Federal prisons
across Amerika spontaneously erupted after congress refused to address
the harsh penalties meted out to crack (read black) users and distributors
as opposed to the powder cocaine sentences.&nbsp; Anyway, he's
been on lockdown ever since and is presently being housed in
Beckley, W. Va.&nbsp; He is a warrior. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I have no excuses, real or imagined, why I have not been more
prompt in returning a letter to you.&nbsp; I do thank you for
reminding me that I am full of shit, lest at any time I should
happen to overlook such an obvious bit of information.&nbsp;
Besides, I like it when you talk dirty to me :-).&nbsp; I will
say that I have thought of you on numerous occasions and even
reminded myself that I should respond to your letters and
acknowledge receipt of your gift to me of the book &quot;Green
Gold,&quot; but, alas, I had no movement of my spirit to exercise my
pencil hand until just now and I am grateful for the stimulation
that you provided.&nbsp; By the way, in answer to your question,
there is nothing that you either said or did that pissed me off
in any way.&nbsp; It has been a long time since anyone has pissed
me off by anything that they have said to me or about me.&nbsp; This
does not mean, however, that I am incapable of reacting to verbal stimulus,
for this is one of my favorite pursuits of interest -- to react
verbally to something someone has said or done.&nbsp; Hammering
what I consider to be hypocrisy or ignorance or any number of
other moral infirmaties always gives me great pleasure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I am always interested in updates about any and all or our former
assocates in the Coptic experience and also all of those who were
considered to be merely fringe performers, imposter performers,
or bad performers who were excommunicated from the fellowship of
kindred minds (?) pecking order because of some perceived
blasphemy in the mind of the spiritually tyrannical Nyah Bingi
Man.&nbsp; I find all of these characters, or whichever category
they may be classified, to be of great interest to me.&nbsp; As I
review each individual that I came in contact with as a result of
this spiritual movement, which somehow evolved into the
ganja-smuggling juggernaut known as Coptic, I find that almost unanimously
these people were motivated to do what they did by a sincere belief
that they were drawing themselves closer to the will of the true
and living God.&nbsp; When many were the recipients of critical
&quot;fire,&quot; and some even permanently ostracized from the
right hand of God or banished to a limbo or non-descript
banality, it was more devastating than anything they could have previously
imagined.&nbsp; They examined themselves, thought that their
intentions were simply to know God and to attempt to purify
themselves, and suddenly they found themselves alienated from
their adopted spiritual family and stamped with the accursed
designation of &quot;fuckery.&quot;&nbsp; All because they did
not fit into the extremely limited parameters of Keith's cadre of
sycophants and mindless robots.&nbsp; No one could stand up to
that spiritually powerful asshole who rode roughshod over <u>his</u>
kingdom of ass-kickers who readily and willingly stepped on each
other in order to draw closer to his and Wally's fiegned
holiness.&nbsp; Meanwhile, these two guys were fucking dozens of
women, each under the guise of sanctifying them.&nbsp; I won't go
into all the horrifying hypocrisy that occurred under the Coptic
banner.&nbsp; And even though all were guilty of plenty of sins
during the 4, 3, and 8 era, only Keith and Wally were in a
position to lead and, thus, they are ultimately responsible for
the catastrophe whose fruit is the rottenness we now behold among
all those of use who vowed to &quot;Let perfect love and
friendship reign, through all eternity.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I am not condemning anyone.&nbsp; I am merely stating what
happened even though I am not going into an in depth analysis of
the overwhelming corruption that resulted.&nbsp; If, perhaps, you
will allow me to make a little analogy.&nbsp; Think of a minefield
that lies in the path of a group objective which promises
unimagined euphoria for all those involved.&nbsp; There is no way
of circumventing the hazards posed by the lethal mines.&nbsp;
Someone, or maybe even a few, must encounter the minefield
head-on, exploding the deadly obstacles, and, by this foray into uncharted
territory of vanity, clear a path that can safely be trod by all
those who come after.&nbsp; Once this path has been cleared, can
we pretend that nothing has happened?&nbsp; Do we pretend that
those who were blown apart by the mines are still among us in one
piece because we do not want to accept that they are mutilated
beyong recognition?&nbsp; Do we then refuse to proceed to the
safety and joy of the promised euphoria?&nbsp; This may not be
the most enlightened symbolism that could be posed, but I'm sure
you can comprehend what it is that I'm inferring. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When first we became aware of the existence of the spiritual
light, a group of us gathered in a place near Papine, in St.
Andrew Parish near Kingston, Jamaica.&nbsp; There was a
manifestation in the embodiment of a guy we knew as Brother Ivy,
one George Baker Ivy.&nbsp; Only a small number of the sisters
and brothers who would at some later times and dates become
associated with this movement actually say and experienced the
vibration of that man during those few short months.&nbsp; This
in no way indicates any special hierarchy because of this
experience or as a result of a lack of this experience.&nbsp; It
is simply, throught the best effort of my memory and my honest
portrayal of the understanding of those events, what
happened.&nbsp; I have a detailed story of how it was that I arrived
at Papine on March 8, 1971, but suffice to say that I was
directed there by Nathan and Cynthia, generally, and, more
specifically, by Howard after I arrived in Miami. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I travelled alone and, when I reached the humble &quot;camp&quot;
in the wilderness I was initially greeted by Ivy, himself, and a
small group of men constructing a foul coup.&nbsp; When I
proceeded to the actual building that was the church, I encountered
Tommy, Gary, Alan, and a fellow named Herbie inside.&nbsp; Herbie was
run off by Keith after Ivy's death for the inforgivable
transgression of trimming his hair.&nbsp; Tommy, Gary, and Alan
became Keith's chosen heirs after his death to the accumulation
of the physical attainments of the ganja enterprise.&nbsp;
Ironic, to say the least.&nbsp; Anyway, Marvin and Andy, Nathan
and Cynthia, Brad, Jake, Sarah, Bobby, Tommy, Howard, Gary, Alan,
Bighead Stevie, Judy, Cliff, myself, and some others who may not
have remained among us for too long attended the spiritual feast
hosted by Ivy.&nbsp; A bevy of African-descendant Jamaicans were
also in attendance, some sporadic and some daily.&nbsp; Keith,
Wally, Dougie (Samson), Kootman, Shine, Blossom, and Flowers were
but a few of these Jamaicans. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Without question; not even the slightest, unmurmured question;
the show, the stage, the script, the spirit, and all of the bit
actors and actresses belonged to Ivy.&nbsp; There was one
pervading and prevalent premise that permeated every singly being
that I personally encountered during this time.&nbsp; This was
not something that was told to you or to anyone upon their
arrival, but once someone had discerned for themselves what was
spiritually taking place, then the accepted premise was openly
discussed by all of those who had what was considered to be <u>that</u>
discernment.&nbsp; What was <u>that</u> discernment?&nbsp; Quite
simply and unequivocally that Ivy was the resurrected spirit of
the Christ spoken of in the scriptures.&nbsp; Quite simply and
irrevocably that Ivy was the embodiment of that divine and holy
spirit which has become known to mankind as the savior of humanity,
the annointed one.&nbsp; Of this one fact there was no
dispute.&nbsp; Of this one fact there was no doubt.&nbsp; Of this
one fact all of those people whom I have previously mentioned
were in agreement.&nbsp; Whatever any of them may say now, or
whatever any of them may have said or done subsequent to the
man's departure from that body, I assure you with every morsel of
consciousness that may exist within me and I vow a solemn oath to
you on the blood coursing through my veins that all of these
people, along with myself, confessed with our mouths that this
man, Ivy, was the Christ.&nbsp; <u>No one</u> challenged his
authority as the only begotten son of that omnipotent God.&nbsp;
I, personally, spoke to Keith of this spiritual phenomenon and
he, as my spiritual equal and brother at that time, wholeheartedly
applauded my awakening and nurtured me personally in the self evident
truth that we were both privy to.&nbsp; It was only after the
death of Ivy and a period of youthful uncertainty and stumbling
that Keith asserted his sagacious knowledge of our blind trust
and became our master rather than our brother. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I will not delve into this transition at length because it is a
matter that each person must acknowledge for themselves.&nbsp; If
each person, both man and woman, examines their personal story of
how they first because aware of this spirit that continues to
bind us in the most unusual manner, then I am certain that they
will be able to link their spiritual awakening, and whatever
awareness they may possess, directly to Ivy.&nbsp; It is a fact
which must be.&nbsp; Whomever you first heard about this thing
called &quot;Doctrine&quot; from can be traced to Ivy.&nbsp; It matters
not whom this person was or these persons were.&nbsp; None of us
can claim ownership of this message of salvation, of these words
or consolation.&nbsp; If, perchance, we were fortunate enough to
be a momentary vessel of the precious promise, this divine
covenant, then let us give thanks.&nbsp; And since we have all
been the recipients of this holy hope of perfect love, then let
us give thanks.&nbsp; We have quibbled for too long.&nbsp; Time
is really gliding on.&nbsp; I can think of no reason to hold on
to animosity for anyone, least of all any of the sisters and the
brothers who share the common hope of the redemption from sin and corruption
that we share.&nbsp; At the same time, I cannot with a clear
conscience whitewash the past into something that is not
true.&nbsp; Once we acknowledge what has happened, either
specific deeds which we have done or the cosmics that we have
collectively experienced, we will be free to laugh and to sing
and to praise.&nbsp; Otherwise, we are bound spiritually from
beholding the glory which we do possess individually and, to a
much greater extent, collectively. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When you, Jeff, expressed bewilderment in one of your previous
letters so long ago concerning the declaration which I made about
Ivy's divinity; that all things have authority only as they are
viewed in the light of his divine sonship, that Ivy is the sone
of God and that this and only this lends credence to any claims
that we may make; I was absolutely flabbergasted by your
incredulity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It really shows how far we all strayed from when first we saw the
light.&nbsp; That someone like yourself, and many others of the
brothers and sisters who came among this congregation after Keith
had usurped control of all of our destinies, could be around
Brad, Jake, Cliff, Tommy, Big Al, etc., etc., etc., and me and not
be acutely aware of Ivy and the indisputable aura of his divinity
which made all of this spirituality that we know and love
possible is a testament to our shamefulness.&nbsp; We should all
hide our nakedness by diving into the valley of disbelieving
unfaithfulness.&nbsp; It is a good thing that God is merciful and
laughs at our frailties. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Keith turned us against each other for the love of filthy
lucre.&nbsp; Wally pretended to be a high priest with the
regimented and mandatory hours of prayer.&nbsp; I know that their
attempts to place themselves on a plateau above their brethren
and sisters was an act of treachery and spiritual
wickedness.&nbsp; All that multiple wife shit was a cloak for
satisfying their lusts.&nbsp; They both, Keith and Wally,
willingly sacrificed their brethren and sisters lives so that
they could fulfill their own vain interpretations of the
scripture with them as Moses, Aaron, Peter, James, and John all
of the other starring roles.&nbsp; What assholes!&nbsp; Keith befriended
the nasty gunmen and actually catered to those murdering scoundrels.&nbsp;
The litany of these types of events goes on and on.&nbsp; My hand
is tired.&nbsp; Did you ever notice how few new people came
amongst us as anything other than casual observeres or money
grubbers during their tenure? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the few short months of Ivy's resurrection, a reverberation
transmitted itself to and through literally hundreds of souls and
links them together even today after more than twenty-five years
of various turmoils. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">All of those who would profess to be loyal adherents to the
vanity of the Coptic trip of Keith and company should remember
that the man died alone, most probably of A.I.D.S., shitting up
himself and without the service of even a hot cup of tea.&nbsp;
This seems a cold tribute, but true nevertheless.&nbsp; The poor
guy had to suffer unimaginable loneliness in his last days on
earth and because I knew him well and loved him, I feel the
horrifying emotions that abide outside of the realms of sincere
thanksgiving that have at times overtaken all of us. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Someone had to walk through the minefield to clear away all of
the fatal flaws of a spiritual mortal.&nbsp; These vanities have
been exposed and they can never again withstand the light of
awareness.&nbsp; Some may desire to retain a hierarchy of
hypocrisy but it has become no longer acceptable to a consciousness
that is determined to give glory where glory is due, to give
honor where honor is due.&nbsp; These accolades belong to God
who, though in us all, is far above us all.&nbsp; Man, primarily
man and not so much woman, in his vanity to proclaim himself to
be God has erred continually and abundantly by forgetting and
neglecting the true attributes of the divine nature -- humility,
long-suffering, the joy of service, and a few more that I'm sure
you can recall.&nbsp; Humble yourself and the spirit will cheer
you, humble yourself and you will walk with God.&nbsp; By the
way, despite all the spiritual vibrancy that Ivy exuded, he was a determined
servant to us all and, although regal in every aspect of his
being, he managed to instill spiritual awareness and infailing
charismatic magnetism in all of us that experienced his
resurrection.&nbsp; It was so powerful that we were able to transmit
this purity to others in spite of our own delicate
condition.&nbsp; Again, I remind you, the consciousness that you
possess concerning your own spiritual being can be traced
directly to Ivy through one of his emissaries that I have previously
written about.&nbsp; The seed of the precious fruit was Ivy and
that whole Coptic experience was a diversion from the purity of
that holiness.&nbsp; All of our enthusiasm, all of our exuberance
from the discovery of the font of life, all of our dedication to
do the will of God, all of our desire to serve was recognized by
Keith and selfishly channelled into a smuggling operation which
ultimately brought great riches to Keith and a few others but
finally caused the alienation of the sistes and the brothers
toward each other, Carl &quot;Z-man&quot; Swanson's death, and
prison sentences for a large number of the brothers.&nbsp; So
many things come to my mind about that absolute travesty
masquerading as godliness that it is impossible to even begin to
relate the depths of deceitfulness which occurred among us in
such a limited purview as a short letter.&nbsp; Tomes, with input
from all of the participants, would be required to get the proper
perspective or, perhaps, endless hours of truthful reasoning
would help expose everyone's persistent desire to mask our
participation in a fraudulent counterfeit after we had experienced
and handled the genuine article. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Where does all of this leave us now?&nbsp; Just exactly where we
are.&nbsp; Each of us has a few brothers and sisters from that
spiritual age with whom we communicate and/or associate.&nbsp;
Then, generally speaking, there is a larger number of brothers
and sisters from the said era with whom no contact or association
is desired.&nbsp; This category is loathed, coveted, or presumed
to be cursed for some self-serving reason which only the
individual, themself, knows.&nbsp; This completely illogical,
nasty, and unchristianlike reasons to harbor ill-will may have
even stemmed from a time when Keith or Wally, sitting on their spurious
throne of judgment, pronounced that the poor brother or sister in question
was, indeed, &quot;fuckery.&quot;&nbsp; Of course, this lent
justification to depise the dear soul into eternity.&nbsp; How
ludicrous and downright mean-spirited are these nerds?&nbsp; And
they want someone to take them seriously.&nbsp; Even their prayer
is sin.&nbsp; And the longer and the more persistently stubborn
someone opts to be in holding onto these unclean spirits, the
more insistent that someone determines to be in defending the
wickedness of that exclusionary little club of scurrilous nincompoops,
then the longer it will be before we can &quot;Behold how good
and how pleasant it is for sisters and brothers to dwell together
in unity.&quot;&nbsp; And that does not mean everyone living in
one house while other houses stand empty awaiting a cache of
smuggled ganja. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I cannot predict how it should be or how it will be or how it
won't be.&nbsp; I am, however, absolutely confident that when
people genuinely love one another, then they can solve any
problems which may arise with ease and minimal effort.&nbsp; You
cannot condemn someone that you love!&nbsp; Leave those weighty matters
to God.&nbsp; We can resist any evil behavior so that it does not
enter into our <u>own</u> realm or action, but we must always be
ready to forgive, especially those we <u>know</u> to be
sojourners with us on this path whose destination leads us to a
perfect praise of that perfect spirit that we have tasted of and
known.&nbsp; Outside of this simple, realistic desire to achieve
this acceptable demeanor, all else results in vanity and vexation
of the spirit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">That was a pretty long-winded dissertation about a subject that
is so long in the past.&nbsp; See what your short note to me
inspired.&nbsp; And believe me, I really had to restrain myself
lest a more scathing analysis of our collective present condition
had poured forth. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This past summer was noteworthy to me because of some very nice encounters
that Judy was fortunate enough to experience.&nbsp; She
thoroughly enjoyed each one and realizes how uplifting the
special bond is between all of these old characters. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Over the 4th of July she went up to Billie's and Pop's house with
Jane Swanson and Irene (Chuck's wife).&nbsp; Gary and Eileen were
there and Bobby.&nbsp; Sweet reminiscing and a touch of
spontaneous praise. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nate and Cynthia and Marvin and Andy visited here in Iowa City
and, of course, the subject was our mutual experience and the
blessedness of this holy spirit that we know and love. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jane and Joel came though Iowa with Blossom and Big Bob in tow
and spent a short time together on some land that Jane has in
southern Iowa.&nbsp; Plenty of kids, Rich Cone, and a few other
folks who had experienced this spirit but were never considered a
part of the fellowship because they didn't have Keith's sanction.&nbsp;
They didn't even know him, but are a part of that spirit family nonetheless.&nbsp;
Plenty of stories and updates always accompany each of these folks
about other of the brothers and sisters whom we may not have been fortunate
enough to see just yet.&nbsp; All are languishing, whether they
realize it or not, for the company of their spiritual
sibblings.&nbsp; All are languishing to see the saints and to
harmonize with others of this limitless family of Ivy's
offspring.&nbsp; All await, whether consciously or
subconsciously, for the fullfillment of that promise that we
heard when first we saw the light. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Samson claims, via Nate and Cindy, that he should be the elder
who is heir to whatever remains of the skeletal bones of the
Coptic and that he wants the St. Thomas property only to have a
place for the brothers and sisters to congregate when and if they
are ever moved to do such a thing. :-)&nbsp; I can only speak for
myself.&nbsp; I have everything that I had hoped for when I first
heard this blessed promise.&nbsp; I can actually sing psalms and
I love to do it even though at present it is an exercise I
perform alone.&nbsp; If this is my sole inheritance, I know that
I am blessed.&nbsp; I have the armaments to carry me through any
battle from both enemies within and enemies without.&nbsp; I
remember Samson as a real jovial and uplifting character at
certain times.&nbsp; When he started his routine about Mr. Mach-a-vah
come from afar riding on his pimbacarry he could certainly entertain
anyone.&nbsp; His rendition of &quot;From Greenland's Icy
Mountains&quot; is truly divine.&nbsp; His long-suffering is not
forgotten.&nbsp; But then, as with all of us, there are certain
aspects of his personality that must be left behind because we
all know that &quot;You cannot get to Zion with a carnal
mind.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In any event, we march on to tomorrow.&nbsp; Who can say what it
will bring?&nbsp; We maintain our individual hopes.&nbsp; We
know, and God certainly knows, what it is that we truly hope for. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If I have provided you with a little food for your spirit to
process, then I am glad.&nbsp; If not, then I am almost as
glad.&nbsp; I know that your hope is a blessed hope simply from
the things which you say and my limited knowledge of your activities. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I can see good in each of the oldtime sisters and brothers.&nbsp;
I sincerely long to see each one of them and to probe the regions
of Zion that we have journeyed to in times post.&nbsp; I suspect
that we are all a bit more familiar with the surroundings this
time around and will not get lost so easily. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When Judy was with Gary and the rest that I previously mentioned
at Billie's place near Chicago last summer, Gary reminisced about
a recent moment that he had spent with Tommy and some others in
Miami.&nbsp; He said something like, &quot;If Tommy is ever
released from the feds ominous threat of another trial that 'all hell
will break loose',&quot; meaning that &quot;Bro. Louv&quot; will
somehow resurrect into the awesome reviver of the Coptic
legacy.&nbsp; I say Tommy is not going to bust even a single
grape until he acknowledges the Vanity Fair of the whole Coptic episode
and refreshes his memory concerning the enormous vitality that he
was infused with by Ivy in the very beginning.&nbsp; He must stop
pretending to be the Apostle Paul or Brother Louv and just be
content with being Brother Tommy who, in reality, is one of the
most lovely and lovable creatures of all time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cliff sent a message via E-mail to Carl asking the rhetorical
question, &quot;What happened to the brethren?&quot;&nbsp; If
anyone has even the slightest comprehension concerning what
really happened to the sisters and the brothers, I suspect it would
be old Cliff.&nbsp; How ironic that Tommy and Cliff have been
within a few miles of each other for over 10 years and each has
their own reasons for remaining aloof.&nbsp; I know them both
quite well and love each for his stubborn faithlessness.&nbsp;
Come on down, boys and girls, there is no difference here.&nbsp;
I love the memory of each, for that is all that I have.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I remain, then, the old goat who has lost his bleat, -- Jim </font></p>
