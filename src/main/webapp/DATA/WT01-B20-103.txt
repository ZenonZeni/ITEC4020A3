<DIV ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Dear Carl,
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I've changed my mind, again.&nbsp;  Sorry.&nbsp;  I <U>would</U> like a copy of your original <U>DEA Petition</U> for an exemption and the appeal stuff.&nbsp;  The reason is that, regardless of the outcome of my case, I think my Sacred Mushroom Church has a real chance for an exemption - since Psilocybe mushrooms are situated much more similarly to peyote than marijuana.&nbsp;  Besides, I <U>have</U> used them as a religious sacrament for 22 years and it's about time I was able to do so legally.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>We plan to incorporate our church also.&nbsp;  Having your original Petition, etc., would guide me in the process I need to follow.&nbsp;  I think my argument has a much better chance than marijuana, as, from the Spanish Inquisition on, peyote <U>and</U> mushrooms have been used and persecuted/prosecuted together.&nbsp;  I think the religious use history, medical safety (Psilocybin is <U>THE</U> SAFEST HALLUCINOGEN, 10 TIMES SAFER THAN MESCALINE; AND MUCH LESS TOXIC, EVEN, THAN THC), and "pervasiveness" of <U>actual</U> use in the U.S. is so close to that of peyote that we'd really be in good shape under the RFRA of 1993.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>so, if it isn't too much of a problem, I would like the copies you said you'd make.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>This doesn't cancel the other items my last letter raised on the FIJA stuff.&nbsp;  If a new trial is necessary, I will want to raise, not only the religious freedom issue, but want the jury to be "fully informed."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I have Jonathan Ott (<U>PHARMACOTHEON</U>, <U>AGE OF ENTHEOGENS</U>, <U>HALLUCINOGENIC PLANTS OF NORTH AMERICA</U>, and other books) lined up to come from Mexico as on Expert Witness.&nbsp;  Also, Dr. John Beresford, retired Psychiatrist who did psilocybin experiments in the '60s, and now heads The Committee on Unjust Sentencing and The Albert Hoffmann Museum will be an Expert Witness.&nbsp;  I'm hoping for others, perhaps even Dr. Hoffmann, although his age, 93, might preclude his being able to come.&nbsp;  (He's close to both Dr. Beresford & Jonathan Ott)
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I'm proceeding as if the new trial will be necessary.&nbsp;  Better to be prepared.&nbsp;  And I am getting ready to do a first class trial - and represent myself.&nbsp;  The motions are done, with supporting briefs, and I'm studying on trial presentation, objections, cross examinations, etc.&nbsp;  I'm preparing a trial notebook a'la F. Lee Bailey.&nbsp;  And with the cops & prosecutors destroying all 4,860 Mason jars of cultures, (knowing & <U>ADMITTING</U> I said I was growing many types of mushrooms), 2 weeks after I got in their jail, but before I could ask for preservation and independent testing - then lying on the stand about a "court order" to destroy the jars when it was the prosecutor who told the cops to destroy them - well, Mark Furman will look like a saint when I get through with the Quad City MEG officers who lied and the prosecutor who let them!
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>No Iowa choo-choo train trial this time, my friend.&nbsp;  Oh, I'd take a stand-by counsel to help - but I am going pro se.&nbsp;  Jury voir dire will be extensive this time.&nbsp;  Discovery motions, jury questionnaire motion & 75 sample questionnaire, etc., etc., are all typed and ready to go.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>They probably will decide not to even retry me at first glance of all the motions.&nbsp;  And each one is proper - not "frivolous" or like most "jail-house" lawyers do.&nbsp;  But then I am a trained paralegal.&nbsp;  I should have represented myself the first time - but, in county jail, there was no way to prepare.&nbsp;  Here in Anamosa ... I've got afternoons and all day Thursdays and Fridays and have been using the time in the law library and on the typewriters.&nbsp;  It has been my only activity.&nbsp;  Then, in my cell, I study for trial presentation - the one area of law I wasn't trained in at paralegal school.&nbsp;  Lists of questions for "cross," for me "Experts," exhibits, order of proof, etc., will all be in the trial notebook - ready to go.&nbsp;  And, I've got the luxury of the first trial's transcripts to prepare with.&nbsp;  All they have to present I've got time to prepare to counter.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>Well, I rattled on for more than you probably wanted to read.&nbsp;  Thanks for all the help.&nbsp;  Let me know about the FIJA stuff when you send the "EXEMPTION" stuff.&nbsp;  I can't tell you how big a help you've been.&nbsp;  Hope we get to meet someday - I'm sure we will ....
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>Namaste,
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>Skip
