        <p align="center"><i>by W. Scott Johnson, Esquire</i> </p>
        <p>The 1996 session of the Virginia General Assembly
        marked success for Virginia physicians in that
        legislation was not introduced which would repeal or
        increase the one million dollar medical malpractice cap
        on damages. Likewise, in past sessions legislation has
        been introduced to amend the statutes of limitation
        extending the time in which a patient has to file a
        medical malpractice action. There were no such
        legislative attempts this session. </p>
        <p>The primary focus of the 1996 session was directed on
        managed care issues. Armed with constituent letters and
        complaints, legislators launched a frontal attack on the
        insurance carriers and HMO companies in an attempt to
        level the playing field which many have perceived to be
        tilted in favor of the carriers and companies, not the
        consumers. </p>
        <p>The first attack centered on the length of stay for
        inpatient moms. Four legislative bills were introduced to
        mandate by statute the length of stay depending on
        whether mom delivers by Cesarean section or vaginally.
        The compromise legislation that was enacted will have the
        length of stay determined by the attending obstetrician
        though the use of &quot;Standards for
        Obstetric-Gynecologic Services&quot; as prepared by ACOG.
        With regards to neonates, the attending pediatricians
        will rely on the &quot;Guidelines for Prenatal Care&quot;
        as prepared by the American Academy of Pediatrics. </p>
        <p>The next attack focused on the right of female
        patients to have direct access to their OB-GYNs.
        Legislation was enacted to require carriers and HMO
        companies to permit female patients over the age of 13 to
        have direct access to a participating OB-GYN for an
        annual visit. Annual visits will not require a referral
        from a primary care provider. However, an OB-GYN cannot
        refer a patient for additional services (another
        specialist) without consultation or examination by the
        primary care provider. </p>
        <p>The most significant managed care focus centered on
        physician provider panels. Legislation was enacted to
        allow enrollees to continue to receive care from a
        primary care provider for up to 60 days after the primary
        care physician has been terminated from the provider
        panel, provided that termination was not for cause.
        Primary care providers must be given notice when
        specialty providers are terminated from a provider panel.
        With regards to physician contracts, carriers are
        prohibited from: 1) requiring physicians to indemnify the
        negligence of the carrier, 2) requiring the physician to
        waive his right to seek legal redress against the
        carrier, and 3) prohibiting, impeding, or interfering
        with provider-patient discussions of treatment options.
        Carriers must permit and require providers to discuss
        treatment options with patients. </p>
        <p>The final managed care focus resulted in the enactment
        of legislation to require carriers to disclose to
        enrollees or purchasers of insurance, all types of
        payment arrangements that the carrier uses to compensate
        participating physicians including but not limited to
        &quot;withholds, bonus payments, capitation and
        fee-for-service discounts.&quot; </p>
        <p>In conclusion, the managed care focus of the 1996
        session precluded significant legislation in the medical
        malpractice arena. It is difficult to predict what will
        await physicians in the 1997 session but a focus on
        medical malpractice reforms is a strong possibility. </p>
