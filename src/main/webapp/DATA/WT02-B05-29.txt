<H2>Eddie Codel</H2>
When death isn't chasing him on his motorcycle or when he isn't lounging is some dark dingy DC nightclub, Eddie can be found doing a variety of things from tweaking CGI scripts to modeling virtual eyeballs. His affinity for the Internet has led to an unofficial consulting role to a varied list of organizations. Officially, Eddie makes his living consulting for organizations who require PC hardware and networking assistance. The West coast is calling him and Eddie is ready to answer that call as soon as the right incentive comes knocking.
