<title>Wisconsin DSM Successes</title>
<table><tr><td><blockquote>

<H3>5. Wisconsin DSM Successes</H3>
Wisconsin utilities achieved a cumulative reduction in energy demand from 
1988 to 1994 of 2,959 gigawatt-hours, which avoided 1.8 million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In 1994 alone, Wisconsin's DSM programs 
saved 549 gigawatts, which cut carbon dioxide emissions in that year by 
334,000 metric tons. Such savings are projected to continue, albeit at a 
declining rate, primarily due to uncertainties surrounding utility 
industry restructuring. Savings in 1995 are projected to be 451 
gigawatt-hours, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 274,000 metric tons. 
Cumulatively from 1995 through 2013, projections show that Wisconsin DSM 
programs could reduce electricity usage by 5,152 gigawatt-hours, which 
could prevent more than 3.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions. <a href="#109" name="r109"> [ 109 ] </a>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="WisconsinElectric">Wisconsin Electric<a></B>.</I> Wisconsin Electric assists in 
providing energy-efficient, affordable housing for low- and 
moderate-income families. Through several innovative grant and loan 
programs, Wisconsin Electric seeks to instill an energy-efficiency ethic 
among low-income housing providers, community- based service agencies, and 
low-income energy customers. Projects have included installing 
energy-efficient fluorescent lights and refrigerators in a newly renovated 
emergency shelter in Milwaukee, in 13 low-income apartments in a recently 
converted building that had been a vacant elementary school, and in 18 
transitional housing units in a joint project with the Milwaukee YWCA. The 
lighting retrofit saves the YWCA more than 15,000 kilowatts annually, and 
prevents more than 9 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. 
Wisconsin Electric also installed electric energy-efficiency measures in 
<B><I><A NAME="GoodwillIndustries">Goodwill Industries<a></B></I> facilities that annually save an 
estimated $33,000 in electric bills. Another project teamed Wisconsin 
Electric with the Milwaukee Housing Authority to upgrade the electrical 
efficiency of 527 public housing units. Wisconsin Electric programs target 
low-income customers who do not have the financial resources to invest in 
energy conservation measures. Through these programs, Wisconsin Electric 
has cut energy demand by more than 4.4 million kilo-watt 
hours - preventing some 2,680 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions.<a href="#110" name="r110"> [ 110 ] </a>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="MadisonGasandElectric">Madison Gas and Electric<a></B>.</I> A small, investor-owned 
utility that sells both electricity and gas, Madison Gas and Electric 
(MGE) has been a pioneer in DSM programs. A 1991 DOE study found MGE to be 
one of nine leading utilities nationally in the delivery of rebate 
programs. Through its "Residential Lighting Program," MGE has been able to 
shift the Madison market away from incandescent lighting and into a 
reliable market for high-efficiency products, achieving maximum customer 
and utility energy savings at the least cost. For instance, in 1990 there 
were only four retailers in MGE service territory selling six models of 
compact fluorescent lamps. Now there are 62 retailers (out of 100 total 
retailers) selling a total of 63 models of compact fluorescents. MGE 
distributes rebate coupons for $5 or $10 off eligible lighting measures, 
and $15 or $30 off other measures, to both end-use customers and to retail 
stores. MGE offers to pay 50 percent of retailer costs for cooperative 
energy-efficient lighting advertising. MGE provides lists of retailers 
stocking compact fluorescents to its customers, and assists with in-store 
displays. Sales have skyrocketed so much that MGE has been able to slowly 
phase-out rebates and move toward consumer education to continue high 
sales volumes. Cumulative energy savings since 1990 are 23,799 
megawatt-hours, saving 738 kilowatts of capacity, and avoiding 14,494 
metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions at a program cost of $1.5 
million.<a href="#111" name="r111"> [ 111 ] </a>
