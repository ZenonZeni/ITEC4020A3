Boxing Up a Quality Finish
</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>New coating system and gas-fired infrared booth streamline production 
and reduce VOC  emissions  at United Container Machinery...</B>
</CENTER>
<P>When backlogged orders for corrugated box equipment piled up, 
executives at United Container Machinery went in search of a finishing system 
that could keep up with demand. What they found not only solved the 
production dilemma, it significantly improved quality, reduced VOC emissions 
and lowered finishing costs.
<P>Located in Glen Arm, Maryland, United is a leading supplier of 
container machinery. The company's innovative history includes more than a century 
of pioneering advancements, beginning with the creation of the first rotary 
press for printing on wood in 1892. In the decades that followed, the company 
was recognized for other developments in corrugated machinery and was able 
to weather periods of high and low demand through production adjustments.
<P>Today, with increased orders for its line of corrugators, rotary slitters, 
die cutters, scorers and glue machines, United has put its 152,000 sq ft Glen 
Arm plant into high gear. Production has been expanded from one to three 
shifts, and its work force has burgeoned to nearly 500.
<P>This phenomenal growth tested the abilities of the plant's 
manufacturing process. Soon, it became apparent to Marc Childs, production 
superintendent, that the plant's finishing system was not capable of handling 
the increased orders and was hampering efficiency and output. Painters 
struggled to keep up with orders, machine assemblers rushed to meet customer 
delivery deadlines, and the manufacturing department was plagued by repeated 
adjustments to the production schedule.
<P><B>Analyzing the Problem. </B>With additional growth anticipated, Mr. 
Childs felt it was important to carefully study all factors involved with the 
finishing process before making any changes. He did not want a quick fix that 
would likely become a problem a few years later. Conversely, he did not want 
to invest in an elaborate finishing system that would never be fully utilized. 
His search for answers began with a review of the relationship between 
the finishing system and the manufacturing process.
<P>Tracking the flow of material through the plant, it was obvious to 
Mr. Childs that the finishing system regulated machine assembly. All of 
the company's products had components that were painted after fabrication. 
So, when finishing fell behind, assembly was also delayed.


<P>The finishing system was common for machine manufacturers. 
Fabricated steel components were cleaned, sanded if necessary, masked and sprayed in 
a vented booth. The parts were removed from the booth and placed on the 
shop floor to air-dry. Drying averaged eight to 10 hrs, limiting painting to 
one shift. Even when the painted components were dry enough to handle 
for assembly, they were often not fully cured, causing touch-ups to become 
the norm, not the exception.
<P>Quality was another big concern of  Mr. Childs. United had earned 
a reputation for exceptional service and reliable machinery. To achieve 
the high standards the customer had come to expect, a number of quality 
control steps were incorporated at the plant, including the establishment of criteria 
for acceptable finish quality. Although pleased with the durability and 
corrosion and chemical resistance of the coating systems, Mr. 
Childs was less impressed with their appearance. Gloss variations from machine to machine were 
common. In addition, the slow air-dry process exposed the coatings to dust 
and other contaminants, creating finish imperfections.
<P>Not all the areas Mr. Childs reviewed involved internal requirements. 
As with most OEM's, United was battling to reduce VOC emissions to 
satisfy federal and local environmental regulations. If the plant continued to 
operate with the same high-solvent, high-VOC coatings that had been used in 
the past, it would limit the number of machines it could produce annually.
<P><B>Seeking a Solution. </B>The slow air-dry method worked fine when the 
company was only producing three to four machines per month. However, 
this was at odds with United's aggressive production schedule. Mr. Childs 
realized he needed to completely revamp the system in order to keep pace 
with the company's impressive growth forecast. He also knew it would be 
difficult to come up with a solution alone. To help, he sought technical 
assistance from Coating Specialist Frank Burnette of Sherwin-Williams Chemical 
Coatings group and John Baker of the InfraTherm Division of Binks 
Manufacturing Company.
<P>Messrs. Baker, Burnette and Childs assessed the situation. The 
group observed that United's finishing area processed a wide range of part 
sizes, from massive cylinder housings to simple ink reservoir plates. They 
also noticed significant variations in air quality, temperature and humidity on 
the shop floor, contributing to the inconsistencies in finish quality.
<P>Armed with this and other information, the three proposed a 
finishing system they felt would meet United's requirements. It eliminated all 
the company's various coatings and recommended a one-coating system as 
the standard. Curing would be achieved in a state-of-the-art, 
custom-designed, gas-fired infrared spray and cure booth. Together, the coating and 
spray/cure booth were expected to dramatically enhance finish quality, reduce 
curing time to a little over one hour and lower VOC emissions.
<P><B>The Coating System. </B>The recommended coating system consists of a 
high-solids epoxy primer and a high-solids polyurethane topcoat. Like the 
solvent-borne coatings used in the past, both products offer excellent 
resistance to moisture, alkalis and acids. The chemical compositions also ensure 
excellent durability to withstand abrasion and impact common in a 
manufacturing operation. Along with these features, each coating possesses special 
characteristics that made it ideal for United's finishing system.
<P>The two-component epoxy primer is EPA compliant, with a low VOC 
level (2.8 lb/gal) and high-solids composition (60.1 pct by weight). It also has 
a track record for excellent adhesion to cast iron and steel, and can be used 
as a primer or sealer on metal substrates.
<P>Polane&#174; HS Plus topcoat provides similar benefits. It is a two-part 
high-solids polyurethane, with a low 2.8 lb/gal VOC level. It is also free of 
lead and chromate hazards. In addition to being hard and chemically resistant, 
the coating produces a high-gloss finish (90+). And most importantly for 
United, it retains its color and gloss even when exposed to inks and solvents used 
in corrugated box manufacturing.
<P><B>Infrared Technology. </B>While convection and electric infrared ovens 
were considered, a gas-fired catalytic Thermoreactor was believed to be the 
right fit for United's finishing process. The reason for this lies with the nature 
of gas-fired catalytic infrared technology.
<P>Infrared is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum of energy. It is 
an invisible radiant wavelength that lies just beyond visible light to what 
is called the red side of the radiant spectrum. Every organic coating has 
a spectrum of infrared absorption, and through this absorption the 
coating temperature is increased.
<P>Curing with infrared waves occurs from the substrate out, and is known 
as molecular excitation. Nonvisible rays are emitted as they first pass 
through the organic coating to the substrate, and because the substrate does 
not absorb the infrared emissions, they are reflected back through the paint.
<P>In addition to curing coatings in a fraction of the time, another 
major benefit of infrared ovens is the prevention of skinning on the coating's 
outer surface, which can lead to pinholing. Solvent is instead forced from 
the substrate level to the surface of the coating where it evaporates. When 
the outer surface has finally cured, all internal solvent has escaped and none 
is left to cause pinholes. All pinholes, even microscopic, render a finish 
dull and rough.
<P><B>Gas-Fired Thermoreactor. </B>The benefits achieved through infrared 
technology were a perfect match with United's finishing requirements and 
goal of lower VOC emissions. By installing this type of oven, curing could 
be dramatically accelerated, and a high-gloss finish could be created 
without pinholes, other defects or significant VOC emissions.
<P>Mr. Childs elected to go with a gas-fired catalytic Thermoreactor 
from Sunkiss. While both electric and gas-fired infrared ovens 
are effective, the gas-fired system was more appropriate for United's operations.
<P>Gasfired catalytic ovens emit an electronic spectrum between three 
and 10 microns, which is precisely the range absorbed by most organic 
coatings. Electric infrared wavelengths are shorter, between one and three 
microns, and hence are less effective at curing complex parts. Generally, this 
wavelength will only cure what is visible to the infrared source. For it to be 
most effective, the infrared unit must be within two ft of the part. United 
processes a variety of parts of different sizes and shapes, and cures these parts 
more efficiently with a gas-fired catalytic system.
<P>The booth is 18 ft wide, 24 ft long, and 14 ft high. It is equipped with 
24 Thermoreactors, and in addition to infrared curing, provides 
convection heat. This heat assists the infrared in raising the temperature of the 
product coating to promote curing.
<P>In addition to enhanced curing, the booth offers United a safe 
finishing system. The ovens do not incorporate an open flame, electrical ignition 
or spark plugs. Instead, an electrical cal rod is used to provide heat to raise 
the catalytic pad temperature to a prescribed safe temperature for 
sustaining catalytic oxidation of the air/gas fuel. Solvents are literally thrown on 
the face of an operating catalytic pad with no resulting ignition, flash or 
flame. The system is designed to safely oxidize the solvents removed during 
curing, further reducing VOC emissions.
<P>United's new booth is also energy efficient. It uses a 6:1 mixture of 
fresh air to gas fuel to provide an oxygen-rich atmosphere for better fuel 
oxidation. This furnishes the necessary power for effective infrared curing. For the 
types of parts processed by the company, this range is between eight and 10 ft.
<P><B>Testing and Implementation. </B>With the booth and coating system in 
place, Mr. Childs had to leap one last hurdle. He needed to train his 
painters. Coating sales representative Frank Burnette and technical service 
representative Ray Bubb of Sherwin-Williams, who were knowledgeable in 
gas-fired systems, offered their services. They conducted training sessions on 
prepping, mixing and applying the coatings, then explained the intricacies of 
the infrared booth.
<P>The brain that regulates the gas-fired booth is a computer control 
module. Once the module is programmed, a painter simply pushes one button to 
start the operating sequence. Process stages include a short purge, pre-heat, 
curing phase and final off purge.
<P>Within a month the painters completed their training and the system 
was phased-in. Through a series of trial runs, the painters learned how to 
position parts in the booth for maximum effectiveness. They also found that 
lower ambient temperatures were necessary for certain heat-sensitive 
components. The cure time for the various 
product components was reduced from eight hrs to an average of 30 min.
<P><B>Stellar Results. </B>To say Marc Childs is satisfied with his new 
finishing system would be an understatement. He concluded, &quot;The difference is 
like night and day. Our painters are no longer rushing to keep up with 
production, they are the plant's new pace-setters. Finish quality is 
outstanding, and we are far below VOC compliance levels. We have determined 
that energy consumption for the booth during curing is less than $4.25 
per hr. With this low operating cost, together with the improved 
productivity, it is likely that United will be able to recoup its initial 
investment within the first year. We are better positioned than ever to respond 
to the customer's needs and take the lead in the global corrugated 
machine market.&quot; <B>PF</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
