<HR>In the period between now and the year 2000, Australia is set to be
part of a rapid development of Earth Observation technology and be involved
in the opportunities of an emerging industry sector. The application of
earth observing technologies throughout our region and the world will be
a major activity as resource and environmental assessment and monitoring
is required at many scales and over vast areas of the land and ocean. Australia
will certainly be a developer of advanced methods and technologies for Earth
Observation, surveillance and monitoring from satellite and aircraft platforms
and may well have a developing satellite launch, sensors, and services industry.
In addition, in an era of data encryption and 'closeable' skies, Australia
will need to gather, process and interpret a significant amount of its own
resource and environmental data and information.<BR>
In order to show leadership in this area, Australian scientists including
those of us in CSIRO and Australian industry must decide that we are to
be more than a launch site provider, data consumer and user of other nations'
technology. Australian industry must 'take charge' of the innovation that
is needed to own the advances that will emerge. Industry and scientists
must work together to make the results of research create competitive advantages
through products having the highest quality and meeting the strictest international
standards. Showing national leadership in this task is a role CSIRO can
and should take.<BR>
<BR>
The need for a CSIRO Earth Observation Centre (EOC) has developed as the
efficiencies and value of focussing the skills of CSIRO scientists in Earth
Observation Science on that task of 'taking charge' has become clear and
the disadvantages of dispersed and separated activities is patent. Modern
earth observing research has at the same time advanced from descriptive
earth 'observation' through an era of data gathering and exploratory image
processing to a point where the value of remote sensing data as measurements
is paramount. Remotely sensed measurements can be collected in a range of
data dimensions and at time and space scales which cannot be accessed in
any other way. This has enabled geographical applications of Earth Observation
to proceed in terms of scientific models and process understanding. The
physical link between the data and the parameters of interest to users is
providing the returns that previous image processing and 'correlation' based
approaches could only suggest as being possible. In the generic development
of this opportunity a CSIRO EOC can create a base of knowledge that will
underpin the activities of the applications oriented CSIRO Divisions as
well as provide the growing value added industry with a competitive advantage.<BR>
<BR>
A catalyst for an EOC was provided by the review of the COSSA multi-Divisional
Program, MDP19 (Simpson <I>et al</I>., 1995). In that review the authors
recommended that CSIRO's efforts in data acquisition and handling be redefined
and enhanced by greater collaboration and rationalisation plus much greater
emphasis on algorithm development and value adding. In the pursuit of the
Report's primary recommendation, to form an EOC, it was realised that the
need for focus and collaboration extended well beyond data acquisition -
which is, in the end, primarily an Agency responsibility. The development
of an EOC founded on generic, multi-disciplinary and cross-Divisional issues
including scene and environmental measurement models and algorithms was
perceived as a basis for developing collaboration and rationalisation throughout
the Earth Observation activities of CSIRO. EOC projects will be outcome
oriented and collaborative, involve selection of the best teams with the
outcomes owned by the participating groups. The move to form an EOC has
recognised that there are tasks in the application of Earth Observation
science that are common to many groups and many purposes and that focussing
teams on resolving these issues is vital to the needs of all but beyond
the capacity of any one current group.<BR>
<BR>
In particular, the need for special focus on generic Earth Observation science
is paramount to the successful development of clients and markets in the
Sectors addressed by CSIRO Divisions and the Australian product delivery
industry. These developments and client acceptance of the products are currently
highly sensitive to the quality of the data products and value adding and
hence to focussed input from the base of excellent scientists that CSIRO
has in Earth Observation. The 'delivery ratio' of generic research to market
satisfaction can be very high. CSIRO has an opportunity for niche development
in generic Earth Observation science and the provision of Best Practice
methods which have immediate payoffs in environmental and resource applications
and to the developing space and aircraft based mapping and monitoring industries.<BR>
<BR>
Following discussions between potential participating groups, a Science
Plan has been developed and has been discussed widely in CSIRO. This document
is the outcome of that discussion and it has taken the input material and
the responses of many scientists and groups interested in the EOC. It represents
the strategic plan on which an Earth Observation Centre will tackle the
challenges of the coming years and seek to generate a centre of scientific
excellence which has highly visible impact on the work of CSIRO Divisions
the applications industries that use Earth Observation data and value added
products based on that data. By the year 2000 this Plan seeks to help Australia's
efforts in the field of Earth Observation from space and aircraft platforms
and the associated services industries to be recognised and successful throughout
our region and a leader in worldwide applications. It provides a means to
see CSIRO excellence become standard practice in the industries addressed
by CSIRO Divisions and in the information delivery industry that Australia
has and will develop in the coming years.<BR>
