<h3> Superman at the Democratic Convention </h3>

<p>
Christopher Reeve spoke to the Democrats gathered in convention in Chicago
tonight (Monday, August 26). He talked of the need for research. He wants a
cure for spinal cord injury. The speech was described as moving. If you saw it,
what did you think? Was it a good disability rights speech? Was it a pity-wringer?
Fix the disabled people and get them out of their wheelchairs? Is Christopher
Reeve a spokesman for you?
<p>
To start with, read these insightful remarks from an historian who specializes
in disability issues and images. And some response to him. Then add your opinions.

<h2>Bad news in Chicago</h2>
<p>
<i>By Paul K. Longmore</i>
<p>

Due to the strenuous and commendable labors of disabled activists
within the Democratic party and the Clinton administration,
Christopher Reeve incorporated some important lines about the ADA
and disability rights into his Monday evening Democratic Convention
address. We should not underestimate this achievement, coming as it
did at the last minute and against considerable counterpressures.
We all should thank our colleagues working quietly but firmly to
get those civil-rights claims into Reeve's speech.
<p>
Mr. Reeve clearly found the words he was compelled to utter
distasteful to him, delivering them grim-faced and grudgingly. He
only warmed up and became animated in his speech when he got to the
subject of cure. He will continue to be a problem for
disability-rights activists. His public role will likely become
more obstructionist regarding the civil-rights of people with
disabilities. We must fashion strategies of response to his
message, but this will not be easy.
<p>
He is already a cultural icon, respected, beloved.  He literally
embodies even as he espouses a series of American myths: the
victory of the human spirit over the worst of fates; the can-do
triumphalism of American medicine, science and technology that can
solve any problem; the preference for "non-political"  technical
fixes to solve complex social problems; the avoidance of social
realities, specifically the redefinition of conditions of social
injustice as problems of individual tragedy and coping; the refusal
to see "disability" as an issue of institutionalized prejudice and
discrimination; the flight into cure as a way to evade confronting
societal and personal prejudice.
<p>
The Reeve phenomenon should be located within the broader backlash
against disability rights. It provides an avenue of escape that
allows U.S. society and the government to pretend they are doing
something for disabled people, in fact, giving us what we really
need, cure.
<p>
But responding to Reeve is not the most pressing issue at this
moment. A larger message appeared at last night's convention. And
frankly, the program was more dismaying than I had anticipated. Jim
Brady's walking served the purpose of underlining the
individualizing of disability as medical affliction and heroic but
pathetic personal striving. His and his wife's appearance was
deliberately dovetailed with Reeve's. The combined message was
about personal tragedy, pain and suffering linked to an image of a
government and a president who feel their pain.
<p>
 The specific disability message was that disability is, in Sarah
Brady's word, "devastating" to families. The solutions to the
problems of disabled people were presented as prevention and cure. 
<p>
The annoyed tight-lipped Reeve said the few lines forced on him
about civil rights, but the dominant message was medical -- medical
solutions for medical problems.
<p>
These performances surely played well with most viewers, but in
terms of the disability constituency they were a serious political
mistake. The Democratic party and the Clinton campaign must offer
other messages that address the real concerns of disabled voters.
<p>
It is important that other disabled people have been scheduled to
speak at the convention, particularly our highly respected leader
Justin Dart. But as much as we all hold him in deep regard, Justin
is our hero and not well-known by the public. He cannot match
Reeve's star power. Michaela Alioto will second Vice President
Gore's nomination on Wednesday night. She too is unknown. Thus,
their presence will be largely symbolic.
<p>
Fred Fay made some important points the other day in this on-going
discussion when he talked about the political significance of the
number of disabled persons appointed to positions in the Clinton
administration and the Clinton re-election campaign. We can add
Justin Dart and Michaela Alioto to that list. The presence of all
these activists is unprecedented and it is important.
<p>
But I have to differ with Fred on one point. I cannot agree that
the presence of these, our colleagues, is more important than the
policy positions of the administration. That leads me toward my
main point: disability issues in the current campaign.
<p>
Fred also sent many of us his valuable memo on the disability vote.
One central lesson we -- and the Clinton strategists -- should
glean from the voting record of the disability constituency is the
first lesson of Political Science 1: in U.S. politics,
constituencies vote their interests. They vote for politicians who
protect and advance those interests, and they punish those
politicians when they flout them.
<p>
 In 1982, the avalanche of letters protesting the Reagan
administration's attempt to undercut PL94-142 (now called I.D.E.A.)
taught George Bush an important political lesson: the enormous
disability constituency would mobilize to defend its interests. In
1988, Mr. Bush remembered that lesson. His pledge to seek passage
of the ADA accounted, according to the Harris poll's election
post-mortem, for half of his margin of victory. Mr. Dukakis ignored
the disability vote and paid the price. A Harris-poll
vice-president referred to the disability vote as a "sleeping
giant."
<p>
The Clinton campaign would do well to keep this political history
in mind. It should also note an especially significant feature of
the pattern of the disability vote. The constituency does not vote
for cure or prevention. Nor does it vote for symbolism or speakers
or appointees. It votes for laws, policies and programs. The
speakers and the appointees are only important to the constituency
insofar as they are able to espouse and advance the constituency's
agenda, and insofar as the presence of those speakers and
appointees evidences the commitment of elected politicians to
supporting that agenda.
<p>
Each day this week, President Clinton is announcing policy
initiatives that address the concerns of various constituencies. On
one day, he should offer a similar announcement targeted to the
disability constituency. Undoubtably in his acceptance speech, he
will pledge to uphold the ADA. He should make that promise of
course, but, given the DOJ's rather lackluster record of
enforcement, many activists will perceive his words as no more than
election-year rhetoric. So, he must do more. 
<p>
Mr. Clinton should declare that in his second term he will solve
the following two major problems: 1. His administration will
present legislation to establish a national Personal Assistance
Services program, along the lines ADAPT has been demanding for
years. 2. His administration will present legislation to eliminate
the work and marriage penalties in SSI and SSDI, adopting the
recommendations of the independent, nonpartisan scholarly National
Academy of Social Insurance.
<p>
 In the meantime and until the latter legislation becomes law, the
President will direct HHS Secretary Shalala to use her current
administrative authority to issue waivers in every state to end
these "disincentives." The Secretary will undoubtably oppose this,
as she has opposed and obstructed this reform for three-and-a-half
years, but disabled voters want it.
<p>
Some activists make the compelling argument that Mr. Clinton is
better than Mr. Dole. The events of the past week (the signing of
the welfare reform bill that will hurt hundreds of thousands of
disabled children and enormous numbers of disabled elderly
immigrants, and the huge political mistake of last night's
convention message) have unfortunately blurred and narrowed the
distinction between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
<p>
Mr. Clinton must give disabled voters powerful, issue-centered,
policy-based reasons to vote for him, reasons for disability-rights
activists to endorse him and campaign for him. The actions outlined
above could counter the negative impressions left in the last few
days.
<p>
Some activists -- and surely some campaign strategists -- will
argue that disabled voters have nowhere else to go. In fact, some
dissatisfied disabled activists are talking about voting for Ralph
Nader, who has a powerful disability-rights record. This could
prove a potent protest vote in crucial states like California.
<p>
Other disability-rights activists are weighing short-term risks
against long-term possible gains. It seems likely that the U.S.
political system has entered on one of its periodic realignments.
During the next two election cycles, the political landscape is
likely to undergo a major reconfiguration. Some activists contend
it might be more effective in the long run to organize and position
the disability constituency to emerge as a major bloc in a
restructured party system.
<p>
I am not advocating any of these strategies. I simply believe they
must be taken into account by all of us, and especially by current
Clinton campaigners. And I note that some disabled activists are
taking a leaf from Mr. Clinton's manual of political pragmatism.
When he regards a policy position as likely to advance his chances
for re-election, they point out, he chooses that course. They are
saying that they can and should be just as pragmatic.
<p>
I would welcome responses and disagreements. I hope we can continue
our collective conversation. Please invite anyone you think would
be interested to join in.
<p>
Perhaps we should ultimately expand the discussion to engage other
issues, for instance, why are the two men who can at the moment
most easily attract media attention Christopher Reeve and Jack
Kevorkian? Could it be that currently the media is framing
disability issues as cure 'em or kill 'em?
