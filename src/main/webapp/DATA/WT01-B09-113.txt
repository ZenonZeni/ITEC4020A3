<B>Project Title:  Lightweight Electric Bus Manufacturing and Design<p>
Performing Organization:  Advanced Vehicle Systems, C. S. Draper Laboratory, Electric Transit Vehicle Institute</B><p>

<P>POC: John Powell, Telephone (615) 622­3884</P>

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>The overall objective of this project is to improve the cost­effectiveness and performance of electric
buses by streamlining the manufacturing process and introducing loadbearing composite structures.
The vehicles to be considered for this effort are manufactured by Advanced Vehicle Systems (AVS) in
Chattanooga, Tennessee. The specific goals of this project include:</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     Optimize the manufacturing process for the current steel frame design, so as to be cost effective for future projected production rates.
<LI>     Modify the existing steel frame design, which carries a non­load bearing composite shell, to accommodate loadbearing composite panels fulfilling appearance, insulation, and structural requirements simultaneously.
<LI>     Develop conceptual designs of at least two types for buses having the entire primary structure fabricate from composite materials 
<LI>     Obtain realistic revenue service data on an AVS bus modified to accept load bearing composite panels. </UL></P>

<P><B>Benefit:</B></P> <P>While the project will focus on development of the already effective AVS designs, the findings
will be applicable to other electric buses of similar size
