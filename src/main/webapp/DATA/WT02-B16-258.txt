<H2>Case Study: Water for Cattle</H2>

<P>
In the gumbo soil country of South Dakota there is not much water
underground, so when rancher Oliver Romey's stock dams went dry
in 1990 he had a hard time finding a new source of water. When he
found water on his land, the well was 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the
power line. Extending the line to power his pump would have cost
$18,000. So, like many people in the area, Romey hauled water to
his cattle in tank trucks each day. After two seasons of hauling
water, he read about solar-powered pumping provided by the
Northwest Rural Public Power District. 

<p>The Northwest Rural Public Power District, along with many
utilities around the country, offers customers the choice of
running new power lines or installing a PV system. PV water
pumping is particularly popular in rural areas because, although
the electricity is used as it is generated, the water can be
stored in tanks and reservoirs. (Storing water is much cheaper
than storing electricity.)

<p>Now, Romey's PV system pumps water through 5.6 miles (9 km) of
pipeline to four stock tanks that supply over 150 head of cattle.
And with the new pipeline, he can graze cattle on two fields that
he could not use before.

<p>Are PV pumping systems reliable?

<p>Yes! A recent survey of more than 250 PV-powered pumping
installations by The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) found PV to be a very reliable source of
power for pumping systems. In fact, the PV modules are the most
reliable parts of the systems; none of the systems in this study
experienced module failures. The pumps experienced operational
and maintenance problems common to all pumping systems.
