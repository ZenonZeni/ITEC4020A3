Felix Wankel was born August 13, 1902 in Lahr in the Black Forest in
Germany, an only child of <A
HREF="http://www.genealogy.com/gastel/0200/fam0284.htm">Rudolf Wankel</A>
(1867-?), a senior forestry official (Grossh. Bad. Oberfoerster)
subsequently killed by schrapnel at Dornach (Elsass (Alsace?)) in World
War I as an Oberleutnant, and <A
HREF="http://www.genealogy.com/gastel/0200/fam0283.htm">Martha Gertrud
Heidlauff</A> (1879-?).  Dr. Wankel passed away on October 9, 1988,
Lindau, W. Germany, where he did much of his research and where
Wankel R&D is located.

<P> Wankel left school at the age of 19, but he gained academic
recognition within his own time when he was awarded an honorary
doctorate degree from Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen in 1969.
His first job was apprenticing in sales for a publisher in Heidelberg,
but he devoted his energy to tinkering, especially after losing the
sales job in 1924.

<P> Wankel's first attempt to receive a patent was in 1926 for a "grease
turbine", but it was predated by an Enke design from 1886.  In 1933 he
applied for a patent for a <A HREF="rce.html#DKM">DKM</A> engine, which
he received in 1936.

<P> In the following years, Wankel mostly made his way by ingenious work
on rotary valves and sealing technology for BMW, DVL, Junker, and
Daimler-Benz.  During this time he developed various DKM prototypes and
also rotary pumps and compressors.

<P> After the end of the war in 1945 his development was interrupted,
but by 1951 he interested NSU in development.  This lead to
collaboration with Walter Froede, head of the motorcycle racing program,
who would ultimately make the decision to adopt the <A
HREF="rce.html#KKM">KKM</A> type.

<P> The first truly functional Wankel rotary engine was a DKM type that
ran in February 1957.  By May a prototype was able to run for two hours
and produce 21 bhp.  The first KKM engine ran on July 7, 1958.

<P> There are Felix-Wankel-Strasse streets in Heilbronn, Dachau, and
Neckarsulm, all in Germany.

<P> Dr. Wankel had a strong impulse towards animal welfare.  <A HREF =
