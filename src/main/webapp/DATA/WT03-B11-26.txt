NEWS ON THE TAX FRONT

     Legislative update.  At this time Congress and the President
are still at loggerheads.  The jam could be broken at any time,
or could outlast the spring thaw.  It does appear that much of
the reform bill is vulnerable to change.
     Most prizes and awards are taxable income.  In Yarbrough
Oldsmobile Cadillac, Inc. (T.C. Memo. 1995-538) the Court held
trips received by the taxpayer from an auto manufacturer were
taxable income to the company president.  In addition, the Court
found that two boats were the property of the president and
shareholder, even though the corporation held title to the boats.
The president was the only person to use the boats.
     In an audit of regular corporations, agents often claim an
officer-shareholder's compensation is unreasonable.  Any amount
disallowed is treated as a nondeductible dividend.  In  Guy
Schoenecker, Inc., (T.C. Memo. 1995-539) the Court sided with the
IRS in finding the president's salary to be excessive.  The Court
noted that the president set his compensation based on what he
wanted to take out of the company, and not what would have been
paid in an arm's-length transaction.  The fact that the president
decreased the bonus of one employee while increasing his own
weighed against him.
     In Announcement 95-98 (I.R.B. 1995-47, 19) the IRS announced
that the expiration date on the 1992 revision of Form 3115,
Application for Change in Accounting Method has been extended to
August 31, 1998.
     The strong bond market is benefiting taxpayers who owe
interest on underpayment penalties.  In Internal Revenue News
Release IR-95-96 the Service announced that the interest rates
for the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1996 will remain at
8% for overpayments, 9% for underpayments, and 11% for large
corporate underpayments.
     In Announcement 95-99 (I.R.B. 1995-48) the IRS released
examination guidelines for employee plan examiners to use when
examining plans for compliance with certain distribution
requirements and for the application of the limitation on
benefits.
     When incorporating a new business you can avoid a taxable
transaction by contributing assets to the corporation in exchange
for stock (Sec. 351).  However, the corporation's basis in the
assets acquired are generally equal to the transferor's basis.
In George Georgiou and Judith Georgiou, (T.C. Memo. 1995-546) the
Court held that inventories the taxpayer transferred to a new
corporation had to be valued at the taxpayer's basis.  He could
not value the assets at their fair market value.
     You can only deduct living expenses while away from home if
the job assignment is temporary.  Generally, that means less than
a year.  In Gary M. and Trudy J. Weichlein (T.C. Memo. 1995-553)
the taxpayer had no prospect of finding work near her home and
worked at a series of jobs away from home, all for the same
employer.  The Court denied her traveling expenses.
     There are a number of similarities between partnerships and
S corporations in the way they are taxed.  But there are a number
of differences.  A shareholder's income from an S corporation can
consist of salary and the passthrough of income, but none of the
income qualifies as self-employment income.  That's what the
Court held in Antonio R. Durando (95-2 USTC 50,615).  Since the
taxpayer had no self-employment income, he could not make
contributions to a Keogh plan.
     Rev. Proc. 95-51 (I.R.B. 1995-51) provides approval to
change the funding method used to determine the minimum funding
standard for defined benefit plans under Code Sec. 412.
     In Internal Revenue News Release IR-95-68 the IRS announced
that most taxpayers will be able to have their IRS refunds
deposited directly to their checking or savings accounts when
filing their 1995 returns.  You must include the necessary bank
information on Form 8888 (Direct Deposit of Refund) and attach
the form to your return.
     Because pending legislation would affect Forms W-4, W-4P and
W-4S, in Announcement 95-104 (I.R.B. 1995-51), the IRS is asking
taxpayers to continue using 1995 forms until the 1996 revisions
are available.  However, Form W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance
Payment Certificate) is being revised and the new form must be
used beginning in 1996.  Some filers of this form may no longer
be eligible for the credit.
     Direct sellers are not considered employees for withholding
tax purposes. In Letter Ruling 9530001 the Service held that
persons who worked as canvassers and closers who went door to
door selling home improvement and repair services were direct
sellers and not employees.  The workers were held to be in the
trade or business of selling consumer products in the home or
other than in a permanent retail establishment.  Substantially
all of the workers' remuneration was related to sales or other
output rather than the number of hours worked.  In addition, the
workers perform their services pursuant to a written agreement
that provides that the workers will not be treated as employees
for federal tax purposes.
     Many small business owners operate more than one business,
sometimes through separate entities.  In Letter Ruling 9530005
the taxpayer performed work for his S corporation and had
consulting income he reported on Schedule C.  The IRS held that
the taxpayer was a corporate officer who performed significant
services which were held to be wages subject to FICA and FUTA
taxes and income tax withholding.  Moreover, he could not net the
losses from S corporations with income from self-employment for
purposes of calculating the self-employment (SECA) tax.

BUSINESS TAXES--INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS

     You own two corporations.  Madison's bank account is
overflowing; Wilton Inc. can't afford to meet this week's
payroll.  Should you just tell your controller to cut the payroll
checks on Madison's bank account?  It depends on all the facts.
However, in some cases it could be very costly move.
     The general rule is that a deduction is only allowed to the
party who both incurs (or is liable for) the expense and makes
the payment.  Let's look at the case of a parent and subsidiary.
Assume you own 100% of Madison Inc.  Madison has a wholly owned
subsidiary, Wilton Inc.  Because Wilton is short of cash, Madison
writes the bonus checks to Wilton's employees on its account.
According to Rev. Rul. 84-68 (1984-1 C.B. 31), Madison can't
deduct the payment.  Instead, Madison records the payment as a
capital contribution to Wilton.  Wilton takes the deduction.
     Generally, the only disadvantage here is some extra
bookkeeping.  Wilton is a subsidiary of Madison, so there's
really no winner or loser from a tax standpoint.
     Now consider a slightly different situation.  Instead of a
parent-subsidiary relationship, you own 100% of both Madison and
Wilton.  Again Madison writes checks for a total of $50,000 to
pay Wilton's employees.  The IRS recharacterizes this as three
separate transactions.  One, Madison paid a $50,000 dividend to
you.  Two, you made a $50,000 capital contribution to Wilton.
Three, Wilton paid a $50,000 bonus.
     The tax effects here are very different.  The dividend is
not deductible by Madison, but is taxable to you.  The capital
contribution has no direct tax effect.  The $50,000 payment is
deductible by Wilton.  Here, again, Wilton gets a $50,000
deduction, but this time you have $50,000 of dividend income.
Keep in mind that there are some subtle tax effects.  For
example, the capital contribution would increase your tax basis
in Wilton should you sell the business.
     Things can get worse in the second example.  What if Wilton
later repaid Madison?  The IRS could recharacterize it as a
$50,000 dividend from Wilton to you followed by a capital
contribution by you to Madison.  The roundtrip of $50,000 has
created $100,000 in income to you.
     What if Madison loaned Wilton the $50,000?  If you can
create a bona fide loan, that should work.  But remember, you
should have a note with a maturity date, collateral, etc.  While
a much better approach, it may not be a sure thing.  The loan
might be recharacterized if Wilton is thinly capitalized or would
not have been able to borrow money from a regular lender.
     What about S corporations?  If both Madison and Wilton are S
corporations, the result may not be as disastrous.  The
distribution from Madison might not be taxable.  Even so, using
the loan approach makes more sense.
     A loan from a regular corporation to an S corporation could
also have adverse consequences.  For example, you own 100% of
Wilton (a regular corporation) and 100% of Madison (an S
corporation).  Wilton loans money to Madison.  The IRS might try
to recharacterize this as an equity contribution by Wilton to
Madison.  You'd get no benefit for the additional capital.
Worse, the S election could be terminated.
     You should also be careful of other transactions.  For
example, Madison produces widgets which it sells to unrelated
customers for $10 each.  Madison also sells them to Wilton, but
for cost, $4 each.  Madison and Wilton are both owned by you.
the IRS might try to recharacterize this transaction.  You could
also have problems if Madison sold the widgets to Wilton for more
than it charges regular customers.  (See Product Discounts,
below.)
     Another point.  In the examples we assumed you own 100% of
both corporations.  That's not necessary.  For example, you could
encounter problems if you and 4 other associates own all the
stock of both entities.
     If you do business through two or more regular corporations,
and there are regular intercompany transactions, talk to your tax
adviser about setting up a parent-subsidiary relationship.  And
keep all dealings on an arms'-length basis.

BUSINESS TAXES--TELEMARKETER-EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?

     In religion the eternal struggle is good vs. evil.  In the
annals of the IRS it's employee vs. independent contractor.  The
IRS and the courts look at 20 factors when making a
determination.  Some factors may not be appropriate.  However,
one factor present in almost all cases is the degree of control
by the employer.
     Telemarketers were the subject of a recent letter ruling (LR
9527009), but the IRS advice was unchanged from an earlier
revenue ruling (Rev. Rul. 74-333, 1974-2 C.B. 328), so it can
generally be relied upon.
     In the first situation, a company engaged an individual to
perform services as a telephone solicitor to obtain orders.  Her
duties are to telephone certain prospects designated by the
company and to record the necessary information on an order blank
at the time a sale is made.  She is furnished with office
facilities, supplies and a telephone by the company on its
premises.  There is no prescribed period of training; however the
company does furnish a suggested script.  The calls are made at
times optional to the solicitor, but she is expected to devote
from 4 to 8 hours daily to the job.  Her services are performed
under the company's name.  She is paid a commission on each sale
and is not expected to produce a minimum volume of sales.  Her
services may be terminated at any time.
     In this situation, the IRS held the worker was an employee
since the company exercises or has the right to exercise
direction and control over the worker.
     In the second situation, the facts are the same as above,
but the worker operates out of her own home, performs all
services on a part-time basis, without supervision, and pays all
the expenses incurred in connection with her selling activities.
The worker is given a list of names from a telephone directory so
that there is no duplication.  She does not submit reports, other
than sales orders, does not deliver the products or collect
payments, and is not required to devote any certain amount of
time to the work, perform any services on the company's premises,
or produce a minimum volume of sales.
     In this situation the IRS held that the company does not or
can not exercise enough control to call the worker an employee.
Thus, the worker would be classified as an independent
contractor.
     Rev. Rul. 75-242 (1975-1 C.B. 321) presented a slightly
different situation.  The telemarketers worked from home,
furnishing their own phones, under the company's name.  The
company provided the workers with all necessary forms and
stationery.  They were given introductory training and furnished
with a required speech.  The solicitors were required to complete
a daily report listing all calls made and the number of hours
spent performing services.  The company also specified the hours
during the day and the number of days a week that each solicitor
was to perform the services.  The company paid the workers on an
hourly basis.
     Here the IRS held that the worker was an employee because of
the control involved (hours of work required, reports, etc.),
even though the solicitor worked out of his house.
     The letter ruling had a slightly different set of facts.
Workers who performed the services at offices provided by the
company and had to work a certain number of hours were deemed
employees.  Those who either had to or choose to work at home
with no restrictions, were considered independent contractors.
It didn't make any difference that the workers signed a contract
indicating they were independent contractors.
     There's no general answer.  Each situation is different.
There is one way to avoid problems.  Try to modify your business
practices to follow the situation described in the revenue
ruling.  For example, have the person work out of their house (or
own office), make them pay for their own supplies, pay them
solely on commission, etc.

TAXES--DEPRECIATION-ALLOWED OR ALLOWABLE

     When you sell any tangible personal property (e.g.,
machinery, furniture, etc.) used in your business, you may have a
gain or a loss.  The nature (ordinary income or capital gain) and
the amount of the gain or loss will depend on the depreciation
'allowed or allowable'.  Allowed or allowable is a technical
term, but it can be a big trap if you're not careful.
     Basically, allowed or allowable means that you've got to
reduce your basis in the asset by either the amount of
depreciation you took, or the amount you should have taken.
There's the trap.  If you inadvertently don't take depreciation
on an asset, the law assumes you depreciated the asset using the
straight line method, and your basis in the asset will be reduced
accordingly.
     Example--In 1988 Madison Inc. purchased a new machine for
$10,000, but through a bookkeeping error, never took any
depreciation.  In 1996 Madison sells the machine for $4,500.
Since the machine would have been fully depreciated using the
straight line method, Madison's basis is $0 and it will have to
report a gain of $4,500 on the sale.
     The $4,500 gain would be the same if Madison had taken
depreciation, but it would have gotten $10,000 in tax deductions
over the years.
     There's only one possible out.  If you discover the error
before it's too late you might be able to file an amended return
and recover some lost depreciation deductions.  More than likely
you'll only be able to salvage a fraction of what you could have
taken.
     Be sure to record and depreciate all fixed asset additions.
While not as popular as general accounting software, there a
number of programs that make it relatively painless.

BUSINESS TAXES--PRODUCT DISCOUNTS

     Rebates or discounts on products sold to customers or
dealers are always deductible, right?  Don't answer too quickly.
While you'll have no trouble if you've got a standard formula
(e.g., 10% off on purchases over $500, etc.), you could run into
an IRS challenge if you get too tricky.
     In one recent case (Foretravel, Inc.,;1 T.C. Memo. 1995-494)
the taxpayer was a manufacturer of high-end motor coaches.  The
taxpayer sold the motor homes through both independent and
captive (subsidiary) dealerships.  The units had high wholesale
and suggested retail prices (to maintain a top-of-the-line
image), but substantial discounts might have to be made by the
dealer to sell a demo unit, one with an unusual paint scheme,
etc.  Adjustments would also have to be made if a customer was
trading in an used coach made by the taxpayer.  On the other
hand, if the dealer could sell a coach at the full price, it
certainly tried to do so.
     The taxpayer had no written policy for arriving at a
discount.  The company took into account trade-ins, customer
goodwill, the type of customer (a high profile owner such as a
leader of a motor home club might get a bigger discount), etc.
In fact, because the ultimate profit on the sale might not be
known until after the trade-in unit was sold, the rebates were
generally not determined until the end of the year.
     The taxpayer recorded the rebates by crediting accounts
receivable and debiting bad debts.  When preparing the financial
statements, the company's accountants reclassified the rebates.
Unfortunately, because of several oversights, the
reclassification was not reflected on the tax returns.
     The IRS contended that the incentive payments were
contributions to the capital of the dealerships and thus not
deductible.  That argument was based on the fact that the rebates
were not based on the dealership's performance.
     Fortunately, the Court sided with the taxpayer.  The Court
found that the mistaken accounting entries were not fatal.  The
Court looked behind the bookkeeping entries to determine the true
nature of the payments.  It also found that a strict formula was
not necessary for the payments to qualify as discounts.  The
Court noted that the product was unique, there were valid
business reasons for the incentives, and that the company had to
customize the rebates to fit the situations.
     CAUTION.  While the taxpayer won, not having a numerical
formula could cause problems in more normal instances.  Consider
a regular policy first; handling it the way the taxpayer did here
should be your fallback position.
     Getting tricky can get you into trouble.  In another case
(Sun Microsystems, Inc., T.C. Memo. 1993-467) the taxpayer tied
purchase price discounts to the purchase by that customer of
warrants to buy the taxpayer's stock.  Again, the taxpayer won
the case, but not without a fight.

FRINGE BENEFITS--MEAL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES

     On several occasions we've mentioned that not all meal and
entertainment expenses are subject to the 50% rule (i.e., only
50% of the expense can be deducted).  Here's some more
information on one frequently encountered situation.
     Expenses for recreational, social, or similar activity,
primarily for the benefit of employees, is not subject to the 50%
rule.  The exception only applies to expenditures made primarily
for the benefit of employees other than those who are officers,
shareholders or other owners of a 10% or greater interest, or
other highly compensated employees.  Family members of employees
are treated as employees here.
     What sort of activities fall under this exception?
Christmas parties, annual picnics, summer outings, or maintaining
a swimming pool, baseball diamond, bowling alley, etc. are given
in the regulations as examples.  You could probably extend that
to occasional office parties.  If the parties are regular, they
probably won't qualify.  For example, the company signs a big
contract on Thursday.  Friday evening, most of the office goes
out for drinks and dinner, for which the company pays.  That
should qualify.  On the other hand, drinks on the company every
Friday won't.
     If, because of the number of employees, you have to limit
the number of participants, that's all right.  You just can't
discriminate in favor of officers, owners, etc.  That means, you
could fail to fall under the exception if the only people at the
outing are officers, or if family members of owners are invited
by not family members of other employees.

S CORPORATIONS--LOSS PASSTHROUGHS AND BASIS

     Losses generated by S corporations and partnerships are
passed through to the shareholders or partners.  However, the
losses can only be used to reduce your taxable income up to your
basis in the S corporation or partnership.  Losses in excess of
basis can be carried forward and used in a later year.  Your
basis is generally equal to your equity plus any loans you made
to the S corporation.  The same rules apply to partnerships, but
your basis can also include any partnership loans for which
you're liable.
     Example--For 1995 Madison Inc. has a $50,000 loss.  You're
the only shareholder and your basis (at the end of the year, but
before the loss) is $35,000.  You can only deduct $35,000 of the
loss in 1995.  The remaining $15,000 can be carried forward and
deducted in 1996 (or a later year), if you have sufficient basis.
     What are your options?  Tax professionals often
automatically advise loaning enough money to the corporation to
increase your basis so that you can take the entire loss.
     Instead of going with a rule of thumb, work through the
numbers.  Can you use the additional loss in the current year?
Even if you can, does it make sense?  For example, assume you're
normally in the 36% tax bracket, but this year you're in the 15%
bracket.  Any additional loss will only save taxes at 15%.  If
the loss was carried forward, you might be able to offset income
in the 36% bracket.
     If the loss for a year is large enough it could offset all
your income and create a net operating loss (yes, individuals can
have a NOL).  In that case the loss can be carried back three
years.  If you were in a high bracket in that year you might want
to make a capital contribution or loan this year to use the
entire loss.

TAXES--PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES

     More and more companies are challenging their personal
property tax assessments.  If your company has a substantial
amount invested in fixed assets or inventory, arguing your
assessment can save considerable tax dollars.  Property tax laws
vary from state to state, so there are no general rules.  But
here are some points to consider.
     o Make sure the assets are there.  You may be carrying
assets on the books that have been sold or scrapped or moved to
another state.  Consider doing a physical inventory to confirm
the accounting records.
     o If the assessment is based on the book value of the
assets, make sure you're depreciating the assets correctly.
     o Check the law carefully.  The rules vary by state and even
by county and town in many cases.  Some assets may be exempt,
others taxed at a lower rate.  Inventory is exempt in about half
the states.
     o You may be able to challenge the formula.  In a recent
Virginia case the taxpayer fought the county's approach that
valued computer equipment at a rate that declined to no less than
20% of the purchase price after 5 years.  The judge found the
equipment worth no more than 4%  of its cost after 5 years and 1%
in subsequent years.
     o Make sure the property is classified correctly.  There are
a number of areas where the definition of personal and real
property cross.  A single purpose building such as a greenhouse
may be considered personal property in some states; real property
in others.  Items in a building, such as overhead cranes, are
also subject to misclassification.
     o You may be taxed on idle equipment that you haven't used
in years.  Consider abandoning or scraping it.

MANAGEMENT--LICENSING YOUR IDEAS

     You may come up with a idea for a new product, process, etc.
that has potential but that you can't explore because of limited
capital, time, expertise or experience in a particular market.
One way to generate revenue with little or no expense is to
license the product to another firm.  Many products are
manufactured under license.  Unfortunately, you've got to take
steps to protect your idea and maximize the revenue.  Here are
some thoughts.
     o The license agreement is critical.  Get an attorney who's
a specialist in this area.  It may cost you several thousand
dollars more, but it will pay big returns in the long run.
     o The contract should take into account changes in
technology.  That may mean it should be for a limited time.  Or
provide for changes in some way.  Technology is changing more
rapidly than ever.  Many years ago, when personal computers were
in their infancy, a large newspaper gave exclusive rights for on
line access to its paper without any expiration on the agreement.
At that time the agreement was probably worth very little; today
the agreement is a gold mine.  Changing technology can also have
an effect on the medium.  Selling the reproduction rights to a
book today may involve a print edition, movie version,
television, video tape, CD-ROM, and on-line access.  Failure to
cover all possibilities could be costly.
     o Definitions and limitations are important.  Does the
licensee include different versions?  Can the product be sold in
just foreign markets?  Just the U.S.?
     o Make sure the licensee will promote the product.  Chances
are you may be selling the product to a company with a rival
product.  They may buy your idea just to keep it off the market.
Or they may market your product on a token basis.  Or they may
decide not to promote your product until they can leapfrog your
technology.  If all your income is based on royalties, your
return may be minimal.
     o Include the right to cancel the contract after a certain
period of time if the royalties don't reach a certain level.  For
example, if royalties don't reach $20,000 by the end of the one
year after the agreement is signed.  You can include a second and
third level.  For example, royalties must reach $35,000
annualized by the end of the second year.
     o The royalty payment will probably be based on sales of the
product.  The contract should contain a minimum payment amount.
For example, the greater of 2% of sales or $10,000 per year.
That will give the licensee some incentive to push the product.
     o Give the licensee some incentive to increase sales by
providing for progressively lower royalty rates.  For example,
royalties are 5% of the first $500,000 of sales; 4% on the next
$1 million of sales; 3% on sales over $1.5 million.
     o Be sure you have the right to audit the licensee's books.
More than one licensee has understated sales to reduce royalty
payments.
     o If the company produces a competing product you should be
especially careful.  The contract should contain a clause
prohibiting the company from developing or selling a competitive
product during the term of the agreement and possibly for a
certain period after termination.
     o Limit the right to assign the contract.  You may license a
small software producer with revenue of $5 million a year to sell
your product and feel comfortable in dealing with the owners.
What happens if Megasoft Inc. acquires that company?  Will you
still feel comfortable with the license agreement?
     o Be especially careful if the product or idea contains some
proprietary technology.  For example, you may be licensing a new
electronic device for the medical market because you have no
experience in that market.  However, the device contains
proprietary technology that you use in products you sell to the
consumer and military markets.  You want to protect that
technology.
    Licensing can produce significant returns for only a minor
investment.  However, you need to consider all the possibilities
and get good advice before signing a deal.  The investment in
time and money will pay off.  Consider too, that negotiations
here are likely to be tricky.  It's not like selling a business
or division.  You still want control of the product.
     Finally, if the product is not amenable to licensing,
consider selling the rights outright, either in total or in a
particular market.  Many of the suggestions above will still
apply (e.g., limit the ability to assign the agreement, be
careful if the buyer is a competitor, etc.).  If you do so, make
sure you have recourse should the buyer default on any deferred
payments.

PERSONAL FINANCE--CHOOSING AN ADVISOR

     Looking for a personal financial planner?  There's a wide
range of choices.  Everyone's familiar with stockbrokers, but
what does the designation ChFC stand for?  Here are your basic
options.
     Certified Financial Planner  The designation is granted by
the International Board of Standards and Practices for Certified
Financial Planners.  To qualify for the CFP license the candidate
must have at least a bachelor's degree, complete an approved
financial planning program and have at least 3 years experience
in financial planning (varies with education).  The candidate
must pass a comprehensive 2-day, 10-hour exam.  After
certification the individual must complete 30 hours of continuing
professional education every 2 years.
     Chartered Financial Consultant  The designation (ChFC) is
awarded by the American College in Bryn Mawr, PA, which also
grants the CLU (Chartered Life Underwriter) designation.  The
candidate must have at least 3 years of business experience (less
with an undergraduate or graduate degree).  He or she must also
take 10 courses through American College and then pass 10 2-hour
exams.  A ChFC must complete 60 hours of continuing professional
education every 2 years.
     Personal Financial Specialist This is a specialty
designation awarded to CPAs.  The designation is granted by the
AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants).  The
first step in qualifying is to hold a current CPA certificate and
be an AICPA member.  The education requirements are the same as
those for a regular CPA certificate and vary by state.  However,
every CPA must pass a comprehensive exam that is the same from
state to state.  In order to receive the Personal Financial
Specialist (PFS) designation, the CPA must have at least 250
hours of financial planning experience each year for the
preceding 3 years and pass a comprehensive 6-hour exam.  A PFS
must complete at least 72 hours of continuing education in
personal financial planning every 3 years (in addition to 750
hours of experience every 3 years).
     Chartered Financial Analyst A CFA is more likely to be a
securities analyst or investment adviser than a personal
financial planner.  He must have a bachelor's degree or an
equivalent amount of work experience and pass three comprehensive
tests, each of which is 6 hours long.  He must have 3 years of
experience as a financial analyst.
     The tests for the first three designations focus on
financial planning fundamentals, income taxation, insurance,
investments, estate and retirement planning, etc.  The CFA
designation focuses on financial accounting, quantitative
analysis, securities analysis, etc.
     Broker or Registered Representative  The person must have a
background in the securities business and pass a series of tests,
including the General Securities Examination and state securities
tests.  He is "registered" with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  He generally works for a brokerage house.
     Other Choices There are many other individuals who will
provide financial advice, but whose qualifications are unlikely
to match those mentioned above.
     Pros and Cons For overall financial planning (estate
planning, insurance, tax planning, etc.) the first three choices,
certified financial planner, chartered financial consultant and
personal financial specialist are about equally ranked.  A
personal financial specialist might have the edge if the CPA firm
you're dealing with has one or you need the broad base of
knowledge that a CPA has.  For example, a CPA with a PFS
designation might be better able to help you with both business
and personal financial planning.  You should be wary of brokers
and other planners since their background is not as general and
they are likely to steer you into investments that they sell.  A
chartered financial analyst would be a good choice for help in
picking particular securities or industries to invest in, but may
not be a good choice for overall planning.
     A final word.  Even accredited professionals should be
checked out.  Ask about their experience.  It is not
inappropriate to get references or ask business associates, your
banker, etc. about them.  And you've got to feel comfortable with
the planner.  Personal feelings are sure to creep in to the
planner's opinions.  For example, a 60-year old adviser is likely
to be more risk adverse than one 30 years old.

THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNet
January 1, 1996

IN BRIEF:

     Director's liability . . . Officers and directors of
corporations owe a fiduciary responsibility to the corporation
they represent.  Clearly, that means they can be held liable if
they act in bad faith or with gross negligence.  And it goes
without saying that an officer or director has to put the
interests of the corporation ahead of his personal interests if
his interests conflict with those of the corporation.  However, a
board member who does nothing may be at risk.  Board members have
been sued for inattention to the matters of the corporation.
     Leasing . . . Leasing, instead of buying and financing the
purchase, may make sense for a lot of reasons, but keeping your
balance sheet clean probably isn't one of them.  In most cases a
lease obligation has to be disclosed.  In the case of a finance
lease (basically, where you own the equipment at the end of the
term for little or no extra outlay), the capitalized value is an
asset; the payments are a liability.  Even if you don't have
regular financial statements, most creditors will ask you about
lease obligations.
     Bonuses . . . Want to reward an executive or employee?
Giving a bonus rather than a big raise can make sense.  Three
reasons.  First, giving a raise may affect other payments such as
vacation and sick pay.  Second, should the employee not perform
as well next year, or if you're strapped for cash, you won't be
locked into a higher salary.  Third, it's usually much easier to
keep a bonus quiet than a raise.  That means you can give it
selectively without creating office talk.
     Speed is everything . . . You're buying a new computer.
What should you look for?  The MHz (megahertz) rating is
important, but if you're looking for pure speed, that's not the
only factor.  Final results will depend on a number of factors.
For example, if you're running software that's heavily dependent
on RAM (random access memory) you could find that a 90MHz Pentium
machine with 16M bytes (megabytes) of RAM is significantly faster
than a 133MHz unit with 8M bytes of RAM.  If your budget is
tight, you might want to go with the slower machine and use the
savings to put in more RAM.  Likewise, if you do a lot of
graphics work, a graphics accelerator card with extra memory will
pay for itself.
     Merger mania . . . If you've got a significant portfolio of
stocks, sooner or later one of them might be a merger target.  If
the deal's all cash, you've got no choice.  However, in many
deals you have an option.  You can elect to take the cash or take
the stock in the acquiring or combined entity.  What's the best
approach?  If you take the cash, you'll have an immediate gain or
loss.  If you take the stock, your gain or loss will be deferred
until you sell the new stock.  Deferring the gain can make sense
in many cases, particularly if you've already realized
substantial gains during the year.  Talk to your tax and
investment advisors.  If you're going to take the stock and plan
to hold it for a while, be sure the prospects for the acquiring
company are sound.
     Tax exempt munis from Puerto Rico . . . The general rule is
that obligations issued by a state or municipality is exempt from
federal income tax and from tax in the state of issuance.  For
example, if you're a Massachusetts resident, interest on bonds
issued by Massachusetts (or a municipality in the state) would
not be taxable.  If you're a New York resident, the income would
be taxable.  There's an exception.  Interest on bonds issued by
Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are exempt in all states.
Thus, interest on a bond issued by the Virgin Islands would be
exempt to both a New York and a Massachusetts resident.  These
bonds can be particularly useful to taxpayers who are transferred
frequently.
     Slow payers . . . Your terms are net 30 but Madison Inc.
always pays you 60 days after billing.  They're an important,
long-time customer and the check always arrives on the 60th day
so you live with it.  That may be all you can do.  However, you
should still monitor the payments.  If the 60 days begins to
stretch to 65 or 70 days, there may be a real problem.  Even if
the company is still financially sound, they may be testing you.
Now's the time to step in and make sure they don't stretch
payments any farther.  In fact, it may be the perfect opportunity
to ask them to speed up payments.
     Is the property insurable? . . . That may be the first
question you should ask before purchasing a new home (or business
property).  Many insurers, hit by huge claims, are avoiding
certain areas or properties entirely.  For example, several
companies will write no policies on homes within 1,000 of the
coastline.  You may still be able to get insurance, but only for
a big premium.  An extra 10 feet back may save you over $1,000
per year.  You should also keep insurability in mind if you're
buying a new car, investing in a business, etc.
