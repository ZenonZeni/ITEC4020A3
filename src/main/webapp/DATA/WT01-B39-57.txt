<p>US Rejects unfavorable DARE study </p>

<p> --------------------------------- </p>

<p> With hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, the Justice
Department has </p>

<p> decided to reject a study it commissioned that concluded that
the country's </p>

<p> most popular school-based drug prevention program doesn't
work. </p>

<p> ... </p>

<p> Justice Department concluded the study didn't examine a big
enough sample.. </p>

<p> ... </p>

<p> DARE receives about $750 million in government appropriations
and private </p>

<p> donations. </p>

<p> ... </p>

<p> Research Triangle Institute was paid $300,000 to do the 2
year study... </p>

<p> based on self-reported drug, alcohol and tobacco use by about
9000 children.. </p>

<p> in more that 200 schools. </p>

<p> ... </p>

<p> However, despite the Justice Department's attempts to have
RTI modify its </p>

<p> findings, RTI has decided to stick with its conclusions...
the Justice </p>

<p> Department and RTI have &quot;agreed to disagree&quot; on the
validity of the conclusions </p>

<p> ... </p>

<p> RTI... has regularly done work for the Justice Dept... </p>

<p> ... </p>

<p> The Institute of Justice invited the authors to
&quot;reexamine&quot; their conclusions, </p>

<p> but they declined... <br>
