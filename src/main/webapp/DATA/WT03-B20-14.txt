<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 121</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>How climate change could 
impact<BR>
Southeast Asia</H1>
<HR>
<B>Scientists believe that mankind’s greenhouse gas emissions may raise 
temperatures and change rainfall patterns in Southeast Asia.</B>  According to 
computerized General Circulation Models GCMs) , the mean annual near-surface 
temperature of the earth will rise by 1.5 - 4.5 C over the next 100 years.  Scientists 
recognize that, while GCMs can offer global climate forecasts, they are still unable to 
generate <A HREF = "fs018.html">climate scenarios at the 
regional level.</A>  Nevertheless, to assist policy-makers who must start preparing 
national climate change response strategies, researchers have begun to use the global 
results of GCMs to conduct studies on the likely socio-economic impacts of climate 
change on particular regions, such as Southeast Asia.<P>
<B>The most serious threat to livelihoods in Southeast Asia would come from 
coastal inundation caused by <A HREF = 
"fs102.html">rising sea levels</A>. </B> Scientists believe 
that higher atmospheric temperatures would cause a sea-level rise of around 20 cm by the 
year 2030 and 65 cm by the end of next century.  Sandy coastlines backed by densely 
populated, low-lying plains make the Southeast Asian region particularly vulnerable to 
inundation.  As much as 20,000 km2 of land in Malaysia, <A HREF = 
"fs272.html">Thailand</A>, and Indonesia could be threatened 
with flooding, including some of the most economically productive land in these countries; 
the city of Bangkok and its surrounding industrial belt is all within one metre of sea level.  
Meanwhile, as the ocean rose the "natural" inland retreat of mangrove swamps - critical 
breeding grounds for fish and prawns - would be obstructed by towns and farms.  
Coastal farmland would also be lost, and the disappearance of beaches would undermine 
tourism, an important source of earnings in the area.<P>
<B>The cost of improving coastal defenses against a sea-level rise of 20 cm may be 
around US$4 million per kilometre.</B>  Although the countries of Southeast Asia 
have seen impressive rates of development over the past decade, such enormous 
expenditures would put serious strains on their economies.  Indonesia has 80,000 km of 
coastline, the longest of any country in the world.  Clearly it would not be feasible to 
protect it all.  An alternative strategy would be to expand land area through reclamation 
projects such as land-fills, with the income from the new land helping to offset the costs of 
construction.  In 1989 Malaysia’s Prime Minister suggested that a series of sea walls could 
be constructed about 3.2 km offshore in the Strait of Malacca as a prelude to large-scale 
land reclamation.  Whichever response is adopted, deciding what areas should be 
protected and which ones should be sacrificed to the sea would no doubt prove 
controversial. <P>
<B>Higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns would <A HREF = 
"fs101.html">probably reduce rice production </A> 
throughout the region</B>.  Besides the loss in output resulting from sea inundation, 
yields on remaining cropland would be reduced.  In one research study, the climate 
scenarios developed by GCMs were fed into yield models for various crops.  While there 
are uncertainties over such factors as how farmers would respond to the challenge, the 
results suggest that Malaysian rice yields could fall by around 20%.  Excess demand for 
irrigation water would severely limit the potential for growing two crops per year as is the 
current practice in the more fertile areas of the country, and higher temperatures would 
shorten the time available for grains to mature.  In <A HREF = 
"fs123.html">Vietnam</A>, increased drought in the south 
could seriously damage agriculture in the Mekong Delta, one of the country’s most 
productive areas.  In Indonesia, excessive rainfall would cause erosion and soil leaching.  
In <A HREF = "fs272.html">Thailand</A>, rice yields per 
hectare might actually rise in response to increased temperatures, but a reduction in the 
amount of cultivated land would still cause total production levels to fall.  If changing 
patterns of production in other countries did not compensate for this shortfall, the world 
price for rice could rise sharply, as Thailand currently accounts for about one third of the 
international market.<P>
<B>New agricultural technologies and crop strains might mitigate some of the worst 
effects of climate change.  </B>Local and international agricultural research centres may 
be able to develop new seed varieties that can tolerate the expected changes in 
temperature and soil quality.  However, this is more likely for some crops than for others.  
Rubber, for example, which earned revenues of M$3.6 billion for Malaysia in 1989, might 
adapt well to climate change, but Indonesia’s maize crop might suffer a 50% decrease in 
yields.<P>
<B>Poverty and high population densities would ensure that even small changes in 
land area or crop productivity would have <A HREF = 
"fs107.html">serious social consequences</A>.  </B>Many 
of Southeast Asia’s farmers and fishermen must struggle for their daily existence and 
would not have the resources to adapt to climate change or to relocate.  If the climate 
scenarios presented in the studies come to pass, government-sponsored resettlement 
programmes will become essential.  While moving populations can create ethnic tensions 
and foment competition over economic resources, <A HREF = 
"fs112.html">spontaneous migration</A>  could be even more 
damaging and might result in widespread destitution as well as in further harm to the 
environment.<P>
