Malaysia: New Agency and Crackdown</h2>

<ul>


<p>

The Malaysian government plans to establish a new agency in 1997 to

handle all matters pertaining to foreign workers.  There have been allegations

that the government's Foreign Workers' Task Force detains illegal foreign

workers from some employers and then releases them to other employers. <p>

The government announced on December 17 that 8,000 foreigners, including

2,000 Indonesians, who were caught working illegally in the country will be

deported.  Among the first to be deported will be those found unfit to work

because they are suffering from infectious diseases, or are judged illiterate

or too old. <p>

The 8,000 illegals are among the almost 11,000 foreigners now held in 10

detention camps throughout the country after they were arrested for entering

without proper working permits in Malaysia.  The remaining illegal immigrants

will be allowed to stay in the camps so that they can be recruited by potential

employers. <p>

A government official also said that an independent inquiry failed to find

any proof that the illegals are being mistreated in the detention camps.<p>

Beginning in January, 1997, Malaysia is stiffening penalties on smugglers

and brokers, making those who harbor illegal aliens, including employers of

five or more illegal aliens and landlords who rent to them, responsible for the

cost of apprehending and returning them to their country of origin, as well as

fines of M$50,000 ($20,000), two to five years in prison and six strokes of the

cane.  Making, forging or altering a visa, permit, pass or certificate can lead

to fines of M$ 30,000 to M$ 100,000.<p>

Illegal foreigners face deportation after a first entry and subject to

M$10,000 in fines, 10 years in jail and six strokes of the cane if they return.

Employers found to have hired illegal alien workers face fines of M$10,000 to

M$50,000 ($4,000 to $20,000).<p>

Late December press reports suggest that some foreigners are attempting to

leave Malaysia before December 31, 1996. Illegal immigrants who entered

Malaysia before July 31, 1996 are allowed to register until December 31, 1996

if they want to continue working in Malaysia.  As of mid-December, 1996, about

300,000 workers had been registered by 17,000 employers<p>

Malaysia built a $22 million, 17-mile wall-- eight feet tall, two feet

thick and topped with barbed wire--on its northern border with Thailand to

deter illegal immigration.  One report says that 30,000 Bangladeshis are in

Thailand along the  Malaysian-Thai border waiting for an opportunity to cross

the border.  Some Bangladeshi politicians have reportedly called for

recognition of a right to migrate around the world in search of work.<p>

A nationwide crackdown on illegal immigrants is scheduled to begin on

January 1, 1997.<p>

Most reports say that there are about two million foreigners in Malaysia,

half illegal, making them about 25 percent of the eight million labor force.

Some 300,000 Malaysians are unemployed.  The number of foreigners in Malaysia

has increased from an estimated 100,000 in the late 1970s to 600,000 in the

late 1980s.<p>

Many academics have urged the government to restrict the entry of foreign

workers and allow wage rates to increase in order to reduce labor shortages and

spur productivity growth.  The government seems to agree: "The future foreign

workers will be knowledge workers.  The non-skilled workers will only be needed

in the construction and plantation sectors."<p>

However, a gas station owner noted that, it is more expensive to buy

self-service gas pumps than to hire Bangaldeshi attendants, who typically earn

M$900 or $360 per month for 12 to 14 hour days, six days per week.  Beginning

on January 1, 1997, gas stations are supposed to begin to convert to self

service.<p>

In mid-November, the Straits Times opened its article "Can KL shut

floodgates on  foreign workers?" with this description of urban life:  "Petrol

is pumped by Bangladeshis, rubbish cleared by Indonesians, hotel rooms tidied

by Filipinos, restaurant meals served by Myanmar nationals and trouser

measurements taken by Pakistanis."<p>

Some 25,000 foreigners from 52 countries are working on the M$9 billion

Kuala Lumpur International Airport.<p>

As the number of foreigners increases, social issues have become more

important.  One leader of a housing estate said of foreigners: "They are living

next to us, marrying our daughters and making this place unsafe." In September,

1996, 100 residents and 70 Bangladeshis clashed in the streets.<p>

Employers often house Bangladeshis, Nepalese and Myanmar nationals who do

not speak Malay, Chinese or Tamil in housing estates with middle-class

Malaysians.  At least 2,000 Bangladeshi men have married local women since

1990, most of them ethnic Indians.<p>

A typical political proposal is "Foreign workers are here to work. They

should not be allowed to mix with Malaysian women."  The government announced

that, like Singapore, foreigners who marry Malaysian women will not

automatically be allowed to stay in Malaysia.  The Federation of Malaysian

Manufacturers wants foreign workers to be allowed to bring their wives to

Malaysia so that the wives can work.<p>

In discussing a significant investment for a computerized method of

handling ship containers, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad said

that "If we do not want foreign workers, then we will have to find ways to

replace them."  The government has tried to offset publicity that says that

especially Bangladeshis commit crimes and marry Malay women to get legal

status.  According to the government, foreigners were involved in less than six

percent of all serious crimes committed in Malaysia in 1995 and only 1,000 to

2,000 foreigners have married local women.<p>

However, 50 percent of the babies born in most government hospitals are

from migrant parents and some worry about how Malays will react to foreigners

if there is a recession.<p>

Malaysia announced plans to create a savings program that would encourage

foreign workers to keep their savings in the country; remittances are estimated

to be M$2.5 billion ($1 billion) per year.<p>

In December, Malaysia unveiled its seventh five-year plan, which forecasts

eight percent annual economic growth between 1996 and 2000, down from 8.7

percent per year during the first half of the 1990s.  Manufacturing growth is

to be maintained by increasing productivity, not adding workers.<p>

Malaysia's per capita income was about $4,000 in 1995.<p>

"Illegal workers try to flee Malaysia," Reuters World Service, December 29,

1996. "New agency to tackle foreign-worker issues," Straits Times, December 19,

1996. "Malaysia to begin deporting 8,000 illegal foreign workers," Deutsche

Presse-Agentur, December 17, 1996. Vijay Joshi, "Border wall stirs ire among

Thais," Chicago Tribune, December 13, 1996.  Brendan Pereira, "Can KL shut

floodgates on foreign workers?" Straits Times, November 17, 1996.<p>
