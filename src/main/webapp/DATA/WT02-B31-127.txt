<STRONG>Income You Can't Outlive</STRONG><BR>
People are living longer and longer these days, but they haven't always made sure that they
have the
financial resources for an extended lifetime.  New York Life's SPIA is a product that can
take away these worries.  Here's how it works: you give New York Life a one-time premium
payment,
and in return you'll receive a steady stream of income payments for the rest of your life, no
matter how
long you live - guaranteed. <P>
SPIA gives you more security than a typical savings account, which you continuously draw
upon, hoping
it will last your entire lifetime.  SPIA doesn't have an account value you can access, but the
income you
receive from New York Life's SPIA is guaranteed never to run out.  That's something a
savings account
can't offer you.  And SPIA also offers you alternatives that can provide a lifetime income for
both you and
your spouse or provide income to your loved ones if you die prematurely.<P>
Your SPIA income is a fixed amount of money based on your age, your gender, the amount
of your
premium payment, and the frequency with which you receive your income payments:
monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually, or annually.  We can send your payments directly to you or, if you'd like, we
can even
have them deposited directly into your bank account.<P>
Best of all, SPIA is guaranteed by New York Life Insurance Company. 
<P>
<STRONG>Safe From Market Fluctuations</STRONG><BR>
In addition to providing a guaranteed lifetime income, SPIA can also take away some of the
worry about
managing your money.  Unlike income from stocks and bonds, your SPIA payments won't be
affected
by market swings. <P>
No matter what happens in the financial markets, you'll keep receiving your money from New
York Life. 

<P>
<STRONG>Tax-Qualified Money, Too<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP></STRONG><BR>
If you have money tucked away in tax-qualified plans, such as  an IRA or 401(k) plan, that
money will
become taxable once you receive it.  Not only could that extra money throw you into a
higher tax
bracket,
it could even subject up to 85% of your Social Security benefits to taxation.<P>
But by putting that money into New York Life's SPIA and spreading your receipt of it over
several years,
you may avoid having that extra income put you into a higher bracket.  You may even be
able to prevent
(or limit) the taxation of your Social Security benefits.<P>
Furthermore, if you place tax-qualified money in SPIA, you might not have to worry about
how to satisfy
the Internal Revenue Services' Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) requirements -
because your
SPIA could automatically satisfy them.  This is important, because the IRS imposes severe
penalties if
these requirements aren't met.<P>


<P>
<STRONG>Maximize Your Income</STRONG><BR>
You can receive the highest income for your premium amount, gender, and age if you select
our "life
only" SPIA.  It guarantees that New York Life will pay you regularly for the rest of your life. 
Upon your
death, payments will cease.
<P>
<STRONG>Protect Your Spouse</STRONG><BR>
Sometimes, income for one life isn't enough.  Many couples want to make sure that they
have enough
income to last for both of their lifetimes.  If you select a Joint &amp; Survivor SPIA, you will receive
payments
for as long as either one of you is alive.  This way, both you and your spouse will be
protected against
outliving the savings you've amassed together.
<P>
<STRONG>Provide For Your Beneficiaries</STRONG><BR>
None of us like to think that if we were to die shortly after giving a lot of money to an
insurance company,
that money would be completely lost.  New York Life offers alternatives to prevent this:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Guaranteed Period Certain SPIA: With this SPIA, you choose a minimum period of time
during
which you will receive payments: either 5, 10, 15, or 20 years from the date that you
purchased your
SPIA policy.  If you die before this guaranteed number of years has passed, New York Life
will continue
sending your payments to your chosen beneficiary(ies) for the duration of the guarantee
period.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
<LI>Guaranteed Total Amount SPIA: With this SPIA, New York Life guarantees to pay you at
least the
amount of your original SPIA premium payment.  If you die before the total money you've
received
equals the amount of your original premium payment, New York Life will continue to pay
your chosen
beneficiary(ies) until the total amount paid to you and your beneficiaries matches your initial
premium. 
This way, you and your beneficiaries will at least "get back what you paid in."
</UL>
<P>

Of course, no matter which type of SPIA you choose, New York Life will keep paying you as
long as you
live.  But these additional alternatives enable you to make sure that your money will go
toward providing
for your needs or those of your loved ones.  <P>
These alternative SPIAs can also help ease the burden on your beneficiaries if you die
before all of the
guaranteed payments have been made.  That's because New York Life's payments go
directly to your
beneficiaries, unlike many other assets that may get tied up in probate. Your SPIA payments
could be
helpful to your beneficiaries at a very difficult time.<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><A NAME="1">1</A></SUP>Please discuss all matters relating to
taxation
with your own
professional tax advisor.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><A NAME="2">2</A></SUP>	If you choose a Joint &amp; Survivor
SPIA, you may
elect a 10-year
or 20-year Period Certain or a Guaranteed Total Amount.  The 5-year and 15-year Period
Certain
options are not available with a Joint &amp; Survivor SPIA.</FONT>
