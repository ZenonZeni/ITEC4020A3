<P>
The Graduate Certificate Program in Software Systems Engineering
provides knowledge, tools,
and techniques to those who are working in, or plan to work in,
the field of software systems engineering,
but do not want to complete all of the requirements for a
Master's degree in Software Systems Engineering.
The Certificate in Software Systems Engineering
may be pursued concurrently with any of the
graduate programs in the School of Information Technology and Engineering.

<HR>
<P>

 <B>NOTE</B>: This description reflects changes approved in Spring 1996,
 effective Fall of 1996.
 The Certificate differs from the description in 1994-96 catalog in
 the following ways:
 <UL>
  <LI> A Master's degree is no longer required for the Certificate.
  <LI> Instead of requiring the five courses
       SWSE 619,
       SWSE 620,
       SWSE 621,
       SWSE 623, and
       SWSE 625,
       the Certificate now requires
       SWSE 619,
       SWSE 620,
       SWSE 621, and
       two of a number of SWSE courses.
