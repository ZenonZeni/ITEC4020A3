Germany-Kohl: Immigration Affects Unemployment</h2>

<ul>

<p>

In a debate on the government's proposed 1997 budget, Chancellor

Helmut Kohl said that immigration has made it difficult to reduce unemployment,

which was 10.1 percent in October, 1996.  Kohl said: "I don't want to suggest

that immigration is the major reason for unemployment, but it should be taken

into account when one makes comparison with other European countries."

According to Kohl, over 2.5 million immigrants arrived in Germany over the past

eight years, almost 25 years after guest worker recruitment ended.<p>

Of Germany's 81 million residents, about seven million are

foreigners.<p>

In early December, a repatriation agreement signed by the Bosnian and

German governments removed the last legal obstacles to forcible expulsions and

Germany sent thousands of letters to some of the 350,000 Bosnians ordering them

to leave Germany.  Under German law, the states or Laender are responsible for

returning Bosnians.  Kohl has been warning for a year that Germany no longer

can serve as the safe haven for nearly half of all Bosnian refugees outside the

former Yugoslavia.<p>

On December 4, German police forcibly placed 24 Bosnians on a charter

flight to be flown back to Bosnia.  The controversial action followed months of

complaints by Germany's 16 state governments that they can no longer tolerate

the social and economic burdens of supporting the 350,000 Bosnians currently in

Germany.  Berlin claims that supporting 36,000 ex-Yugoslavians costs DM500

million per year.<p>

Since October, 1996, some 35 Bosnians have been forcibly deported and 2,500

have voluntarily returned.  According to German officials there will be no more

mass returns until February 1997.<p>

In September, the German interior ministers of the Laender agreed to

repatriate the Bosnians in two phases; the first to be returned are unmarried

persons and couples without children.  Many have already received letters

ordering them to leave Germany.  After May 1, 1997, the remainder of the

Bosnians will be ordered to leave Germany.<p>

Critics of German policy say that dumping a large number of refugees on the

doorstep of the Sarajevo government while the political situation remains so

unstable will reduce the prospects for peace in Bosnia.<p>

A South African soccer/football player was the first person to become a

German citizen under a new law that gives 10 athletes per year preferential

access to German citizenship.  Rules such as the 10-year residence requirement

were waived so that a South African player could join the German national

team.<p>

In 1946, three million Czechs of German origin-- Sudeten Germans-- were

expelled from Czech territory and their property expropriated.  The unmet

German demand that the Czechs apologize for "ethnic cleansing" has so far

prevented the full normalization of relations.  On December 20, 1996, Germany

and the Czech Republic signed a declaration aimed at mending bilateral

relations.  <p>

In the declaration, Germany expressed contrition for the invasion and

occupation of Czechoslovakia from 1939 to 1945.  The Czechs regret the

expulsion of the Sudeten Germans at the end of the war.  Both sides agreed to

create a Czech-German Future Fund that will finance environmental, historical

and scientific projects, especially those that in some way help the victims of

the Third Reich.<p>

The Czech Republic is the last of the countries occupied by Nazi Germany to

fully normalize its relationship with Germany.<p>

The declaration does not address land ownership questions. The Czech

supreme court in 1995 upheld a 1945 decree that stripped Czechs of ethnic

German origin of their property and gave an amnesty to Czechs accused of

committing crimes of revenge against them.<p>

Czechs and Slovaks formed Czechoslovakia in 1918 and Ruthenia joined in

1919.  Before that, Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia had been parts of the

Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Between World War I and World War II, Czechoslovakia

was 52 percent Czech, 23 percent German and 16 percent Slovak.<p>

The three million Sudeten Germans, who wield considerable influence within

the Christian Social Union, have demanded compensation for lost property and

threatened to hold up Prague's candidacy for membership in the EU and NATO.

They are the most powerful group of expellees (Vertriebene), the 12 million

Germans expelled from the eastern lands at the end of the war who became strong

supporters of the ruling Christian Democratic/Christian Socialist

coalition.<p>

Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has refused to open a dialogue with the

Sudeten Germans, saying that "never, not in my wildest dreams" would he consent

to meet with those who welcomed Hitler's invading army.<p>

A profile of a Vietnamese cigarette vendor in Germany who was returned to

Hanoi emphasized that selling untaxed cigarettes was more profitable than

working in Vietnam.  There are an estimated 40,000 Vietnamese in Germany who

are to be returned under a September 1995 agreement by 2000.  <p>

Some 2,500 Vietnamese were to be returned by December 1995, but as of

December 1996, only 1,500 were returned.  Most Vietnamese are returned in small

groups, on commercial flights, accompanied by German border

police.<i></i><p>
