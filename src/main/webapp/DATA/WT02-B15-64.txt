<H2>Protect Yourself: BEFORE YOU GO</H2>

<H3>VACCINATION</H3>

<P>Typhoid immunization is advised for international travelers going
to areas where typhoid is prevalent, particularly if you are likely
to be exposed to potentially contaminated food/water, travel in rural
areas or have close contact with local residents. Typhoid
immunization is not a legal requirement for entry into any country
and no certificate of vaccination is necessary.</P>

<P>Travelers who are taking H2 Antagonists (such as Tagamet&#174,
Zantac&#174, Pepsid&#174, etc.) are also at a higher risk for
Typhoid Fever as they have less gastric acid which works to destroy
bacteria in the stomach.</P>

<H3><A NAME="anchor572783"></A>ORAL Typhoid Vaccine</H3>

<P>Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a is the first and only oral vaccine
for typhoid fever protection. Unlike most "vaccines", this vaccine
comes in a capsule rather than a syringe. Known as VIVOTIF BERNA&#174, it
ranks internationally among the most significant vaccine developments
in the last 25 years.</P>

<H4><B>History &amp; Development</B></H4>

<P>It's hard to read about today's medicine and not find some new
discovery in biotechnology. During the last decade, the
pharmaceutical industry has focused more and more research and
development efforts on the miracles possible through biotechnology.
</P>

<P>However for companies involved in research and development of
VACCINES, "biotechnology" is old hat. BERNA PRODUCTS, CORP.'s parent
company, The Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne (SSVIB) has
utilized biotechnology for years! The development of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174,
which began in 1969 is just such an example. Developed over a 12 year
period, it is a unique oral vaccine. To date, over 150 million doses
taken worldwide.</P>

<P>The introduction of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 in the United States in 1990 was
a joint effort between The Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute Berne
and the US Military who helped to fund the field trials necessary for
FDA approval. Following its approval, in 1991 the Armed Forces
Epidemiology Board (the Defense Department's medical advisory panel)
recommended that all troops going overseas be given the oral vaccine.
Since then, over 100 million doses of VIVOTIF BERNA&#174 oral
typhoid vaccine have been taken in the United States.</P>

<H4><B>"Vaccination"</B></H4>

<P>Vaccination" consists of 4 capsules and should be completed 1 week
prior to potential exposure.</P>

<P>The schedule is simple, one (1 ) capsule is taken every other day
on an empty stomach (ie. 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating). Many
people find that it's easiest to take the capsule at bedtime.</P>

<P>Protection from typhoid fever lasts 5 years. Capsules should
always be stored in the refrigerator.</P>

<P>This vaccine should NOT be used by :</P>

<UL>
   <LI>children under the age of 6
   
   <LI>pregnant or breast-feeding women
   
   <LI>immunocompromised patients
   
   <LI>patients with a fever
   
   <LI>anyone taking antibiotics
</UL>
