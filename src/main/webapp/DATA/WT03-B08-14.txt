QUARTERLY APPRAISALS REPLACE NATWEST'S ANNUAL PAY REVIEW

THE UK'S National Westminster Bank has introduced a new employee
appraisal system in an effort to do away with the stress of an annual
pay and performance review.

In Britain, January is traditionally the time when banks and insurance
companies review their employees' progress in the last 12 months and
the time when performance-based pay increases or promotions are made.

But many human resource executives - and staff members - are unhappy
with having only one opportunity a year to discuss performance.

At NatWest two new measures based on quarterly meetings between staff
and their line managers have been introduced to tackle the remoteness
of the annual review.

Kelvin Moore, senior human resources executive in NatWest's UK branch
business, said the new appraisal system is aimed at creating "an
ongoing dialogue" between staff and line managers about their
individual development and their management and technical abilities.

"The view was that there needed to be far more thinking about how an
individual develops," Moore said. So the bank started a new programme,
"valuing individual performance", which is aimed at identifying
employees' development needs, possible training courses and other
activities. The programme applies to all staff every three months.

"When we talk about people's developmental needs we would seek
opportunities in their current roles to develop their skills," Moore
said.

Running along side "valuing individual performance" are "individual
performance plans" which set out what the individual should be trying
to achieve. "We are moving away from saying that the only thing that is
important is profit and increasing our focus on corporate health,"
Moore said.

"Individual performance plans" use balanced business score cards.
Similar score cards are also used for business units within the NatWest
group and for the group itself. "The individual performance plans
should be feeding into that," he said.

The balanced score card seeks results and achievements in four areas:
financial; customer service; quality; and organisational development.
"Organisational development is about how you manage and motivate to
help our staff perform," Moore said. "There are quality targets at each
branch and we use a customer service index and mystery shoppers to test
the level of service in each branch.

"If everyone is performing according to their individual plan that will
have an upward effect on the organisation. The totality of their input
will lead to improved organisation. The objective is to further
motivate that totality."

NatWest admits that a three-monthly appraisal system costs much more in
terms of paperwork, time and money, as an annual review - but Moore
believes the approach is more cost effective.

"It is more valuable to us," he said. "The only way to get sustainable
market advantage is through the collective achievement of your staff.
Under the old annual review system people often forgot towards the end
of the year what happened in the first three months. There are huge
efficiencies in our new system because it's forward looking, it helps
us plan our training and development schedule. In 1994 we were looking
ahead to our human resource needs for 1995."

Alan Ainsworth, assistant secretary of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, admitted that "in crude terms the system is very good".
But the trade unionist believes there are problems with its
implementation.

"If people are in an office that has very tight staffing levels there
are problems finding time appraisal," Ainsworth said. "There is also a
problem with people not understanding the system - both staff and
managers. Under the old system, if you got a high score, you knew that
would be reflected in your pay rise. People don't see how the new
system relates to their pay packet.

"The new system is so vague that no one is comfortable with it. Staff
are used to managers telling them what to do, they are not used to
managers talking about it."

Despite trade union misgivings, Moore claims the system is popular with
NatWest's workforce. "Our internal surveys show that our 55,000 staff
have welcomed this," he said. "They see it as something that is
developmental and training orientated. It is very important to them
that they continually update their skills and it's very healthy for the
organisation to have staff in a developmental frame of mind."

NatWest also claim that the quarterly staff appraisal has helped team
work. "We wanted to encourage local teams and managers by getting a
dialogue going between individuals and their line managers," said
Moore. "'Valuing individual performance' encourages line managers to
have conversations about staff development as part of their day to day
activities and it makes our managers more coaching orientated."

Though the new quarterly appraisal system applies to all staff, NatWest
is continuing to use its old system of measuring competencies among
senior managers.

"At NatWest group we are quite well advanced in our understanding and
use of competencies which we have developed over 40 years," Moore said.
"We have identified 11 critical competencies needed by a quite a small
percentage of high performance managers which differentiates units in
terms of performance. The real ideal is understanding them and relating
them to individual performance. Research has shown that most highly
successful managers are good at two or three competencies
- but they know which they are good at and play to their strengths.

"After identifying individual strengths and weaknesses we do not go
about a remedial exercise. It's important to find out what people are
good at, then get them better at that. To use a sporting analogy, if
you have a good goal scorer in a football team, you do not start
training him to be a goalkeeper, you work at making him a better
striker. You organise teams so that they have a range of skills between
them. A team where people have different strengths and competencies
will always perform better than a team of all rounders."

CENTRAL BANK NEEDS TO CUT JOBS

FRANCE'S CENTRAL bank needs to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs in the
next five to ten years, according to an external report by consulting
firms McKinsey, Bernard Bruhnes and Gide Loyrette Nouel.

The report commissioned by the governors of the Banque de France, has
sowed fear among the current staff of 16,500.

The consultants claim the move is needed if the Banque de France is to
become as competitive as other European central banks. The report
outlined the importance in information processing and the printing and
sorting of banknotes. At present 2,050 people are employed by the
central bank and one French banknote costs between 80 centimes and 1
franc to manufacture, a sum far higher than most other national issuing
houses.

RAPID GROWTH IN SALARIES FOR UK MANAGERS

SALARY COSTS of managerial and professional staff in the UK grew at a
faster rate in 1994 than in the previous year.

According to research by London-based Incomes Data Services (IDS), pay
awards for managerial staff between August and October this year
averaged 3.4 percent - compared with average increases of only 2.7
percent in 1993.

IDS warned that the increase in pay awards does not necessarily mean
the start of a new inflationary spiral. The independent research
organisation said relatively few pay awards are made in the third
quarter of the year. "January and April are much more significant
months," said IDS's Steve Glenn.

FIRST UNION ABANDONS COMBINED SALESFORCE

THE ONLY major US bank with a combined salesforce for its trust and
brokerage departments is abandoning the initiative after two years.

In 1992, First Union, based in Charlotte, Carolina, combined its 80
brokers and 40 salesmen from its personal trust department to create an
integrated salesforce of "personal investment counsellors" (PICs).
Since then the number of PICs has grown to 200.

But now the super-regional bank is scrapping the initiative. "The sales
were not as high as expected," a spokesman said. "In the future, we
want to go after the trust side of the business more aggressively."

The bank plans to refocus its PICs exclusively on brokerage sales and
will recruit an entirely new salesforce of 75 dedicated trust
professionals between now and January 1995. The decision comes soon
after the resignation of Lamar Polston, First Union's retail brokerage
chief, in September.

"My guess is that their cross-training didn't work," said John DeMarco,
a director at wealth market research firm, PSI.

STANDARD CHARTERED TO CUT STAFF

STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK's seventh-biggest bank in terms of assets,
is reducing its worldwide staff by 3,000 between now and the end of
1995.

The UK-based international bank, which employed 30,000 last year, is
well on its way to meeting that target. A bank spokesman said it has
already shed about 1,000 staff in India and Africa using voluntary
redundancy schemes.

"We are selling off non-core assets," the spokesman added. "It is a
positive move as far as the business and shareholders are concerned."

The 10 percent cut in Standard Chartered's workforce is aimed at
cutting running costs in the medium term. According to its last interim
report, Standard Chartered's operating costs rose by 7 percent in the
first half of 1994.

SWISS RE TAKES DERIVATIVES STAKE

A STRATEGIC alliance has been formed between insurance company Swiss Re
and the banking group CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse.
Swiss Re is taking a 20 percent stake in Credit Suisse Financial
Products, a derivatives joint venture between Credit Suisse and CS
First Boston.

A joint statement by the new partners said the move would"enable both
companies to benefit from each other's expertise by developing new
products, and to respond to new market developments which link
reinsurance products with banking products."

VOLUNTARY WORK BENEFITS EMPLOYEES

POSTING STAFF on charity assignments is an excellent human resource
practice, claims a UK group, Action: Employees in the Community.

Many UK banks and insurance companies have recognised the public
relations value of staff who are involved in voluntary work. But now,
they are beginning to see the training benefits too. National
Westminster Bank is one of a group of companies which are trying to
find a method of measuring these benefits.

Action claims that temporary charity assignments for junior and
middle-managers may be a way of solving the problem of how to give
staff a taste of responsibility in today's flatter organisations.

TSB uses charity work as a key part of its management training
programme and candidates for promotion are encouraged to take part in
short-term projects, such as helping charities to draw up business
plans. The bank thinks charity work is also a way of developing
leadership skills - in an environment where most people are volunteers,
dictatorial management does not work, volunteers need to be coached,
encouraged and motivated.

ATMS ON THE RISE IN JAPAN

AUTOMATIC TELLER Machine (ATM) branches in Japan are expected to
outnumber staffed branches at 11 city banks by the end of 1995.

Unmanned branches are likely to increase by 428 to 3,922 by the end of
March. At present the banks have 3,573 staffed branches.

The new ATM units will reduce running costs while extending the banks'
retail base. Japanese banks are under heavy pressure to reduce costs
because of bad debt write-offs.

BUILDING SOCIETY STAFF OPT FOR REDUNDANCY

STAFF AT the Halifax and Leeds Permanent Building Societies are said to
be queuing up for voluntary redundancy payments.

The two building societies' plan to merge and then convert to a public
limited company with full banking licence (see HRBI 18) has been
approved by the UK authorities. President of the board of trade Michael
Heseltine has said he will not refer the planned move to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.

The societies hope to reduce staff numbers after the merger through
natural wastage - but, according to their staff associations, many
employees are hoping to benefit from the voluntary redundancy packages
on offer.

Two factors are given for the popularity of the redundancy schemes: the
packages on offer are generous, for example, Leeds staff who succeed in
volunteering for redundancy would receive two and a half times their
annual salary in a lump sum; and with overall numbers employed in the
building society sector increasing, many staff feel they will easily
find employment elsewhere.

The members of both societies will vote on the merger proposal this
spring. If it goes ahead, there is already speculation that a further
merger with TSB Group may be in the offing. The advantage of such a
move is that it would immediately give the Halifax a large number of
new current account holders who do not yet have a relationship with
either building society.

FRANCE: REFORM OF BANKING HOURS FALLS THROUGH

A MUCH hoped for reform of bank opening hours in France has collapsed
after all five unions involved failed to agree with the proposals.
Talks on the issue lasted for almost a year, and at one stage, a
breakthrough seemed likely (see HRBI 17).

Since 1937 French bank opening hours have been restricted by a decree
limiting freedoms that banks elsewhere take for granted. For example:
shift working is restricted - 9 am to 5 pm is still the general rule;
and many banks are barred from opening on Saturdays.

The restrictions applied to members of the Association Francaise des
Banques (AFB). But three key players in France's financial sector are
not AFB members and so are not limited by the decree.

These are: CCP, the banking arm of La Poste, which opens 59 hours a
week and employs shift workers; Credit Agricole which was originally a
farmers' bank and was given greater flexibility to serve rural
customers; and the co-operative and savings banks, which were not
regarded as full banks in 1937.

The AFB argues that its member banks are losing business to those
financial institutions which are exempt from the decree. In the last
ten years savings banks have expanded steadily, while AFB members have
been forced to rationalise and cut jobs.

The decree could have been annulled by the labour minister using laws
aimed at removing job creation barriers. Instead, he called on the
banks to negotiate with the unions.

But the talks got off to a poor start. Early on two unions, the
Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and Force Ouvriere (FO),
launched anti-reform campaigns that painted a picture of employees
working around the clock, seven days a week. This left the AFB with
only three unions with which to negotiate: the managers' union, the
SNB/CGC; the CFDT; and the CFTC. These unions, refusing to discuss a
repeal of the 1937 decree, said they would only consider its revision.

After a brief deadlock, the AFB agreed to discuss revision and a
30-month trial period ending in November 1997 was agreed. The three
unions said if the trial lead to job creation it would become
permanent, while the AFB offered to cut working hours by 20 percent for
those working later than 6 pm.

But the proposal collapsed when the CFTC claimed that staff incentives
were not good enough to guarantee that employee participation would
indeed be strictly voluntary and the AFB refused to include
a"volunteers only" clause in the agreement.

The SNB/CGC also wanted more detailed negotiations with individual
banks, a move the AFB said would delay the trial by a year.

By December, the AFB's only hope was the CFDT, which still seemed to
favour reform. Additional concessions were given, including one where
employees received payment for 39 hours' work, while only working a 35
hour week. But the final nail in the coffin came on December 15, when
more than 60 percent of the CFDT's members voted to reject the
proposal.

FRANCE:  UAP FAVOURS PART-TIMERS

EUROPE'S SECOND-largest insurer, UAP, has signed a "contract for state
employment" with the French government.

The deal signed by UAP president Jacques Friedmann and labour minister
Michel Giraud means that an agreement made by the company last May to
introduce voluntary part-time working for administrative personnel at
UAP will go ahead.

The accord aims to put in place a job share scheme that will take
advantage of the new legislation on part-time work, which UAP said will
"increase employment but not reduce the company's volume of work".

UAP hopes to create 400 new jobs in 1995 through encouraging existing
staff to work part time or to take "progressive retirement".

The company said it hopes, on the one hand, to contribute to the
collective effort to fight unemployment and, on the other hand, to
correct its "age pyramid" by taking on younger staff who will bring new
skills to the company. In the meantime, employees aged over 55 will be
offered a "progressive departure" programme which will allow them to
pass on their expertise to younger employees through a newly
established tutoring system.

Always keen to be seen as innovative in matters of human resources, UAP
wishes "to demonstrate that job sharing is the way forward, viable on
the ground and beneficial to all involved: the company, the employees
and the group".

STAFF SUPPORT SCHEMES CATCH ON WITH INSURERS

MOST NORTH American insurance companies now have formal staff support
schemes aimed at helping employees overcome personal problems,
according to the Life Office Management Association (LOMA).

The schemes, described by LOMA as employee assistance programmes
(EAPS), are designed to identify and resolve those employee problems
which may lead to reduced productivity. The problems may be
work-related or domestic. According to LOMA, the EAPs address issues
including: personal health; marriage and family; money management/debt;
alcohol/chemical dependency; legal problems; or job stress.

A LOMA survey of 145 US and Canadian life and health insurers found
that about two-thirds or respondents offered EAPs and saw them as a
method that reduced absenteeism and improved productivity and work
quality.

Eighty percent of companies which provide EAPs do so through subsidised
counselling services. More than 90 percent of them also extend their
services to employees' immediate families.

Responsibility for EAPs usually rests with human resources departments,
however, the survey found that about 80 percent of the companies with
EAPs provide them through outside agencies.

According to LOMA, assistance with marital/family problems was the most
commonly used service, with psychological assistance running a close
second - particularly for problems related to clinical depression.
Alcohol and substance abuse, the original impetus for the development
of EAPs in the early-1980s, ranked fourth on the list of frequently
used treatments.

PORTUGAL: BPSM'S OVERSTAFFING CURE: MORE BRANCHES

THE FIFTH-LARGEST bank in Portugal plans to increase its branch network
by more than 50 percent in the next five years and thus help solve a
chronic overstaffing problem.

Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor (BPSM) is now back in the hands of the
Champalimaud family, 19 years after it was nationalised in 1975. BPSM's
former owners Antonio Champalimaud and his son Luis, now hold 80
percent of the bank after paying Esc1,528 ($10) per share for 24.4
million BPSM shares. Their bid was considerably higher than the
Esc1,300 offered by the only other bidder in the reprivatisation, Banco
Financia.

BPSM's return to the Champalimaud empire, which includes one of the
country's largest insurance group, Cia de Seguros Mundial Confianca,
creates the biggest financial group in Portugal.

As if this was not enough, Luis Champalimaud, in an interview with the
weekly newspaper Expresso, said that a massive expansion programme is
planned for the bank. This covered not only increased credit and
deposits, but also a huge increase in the number of bank branches and a
corresponding increase in employees.

BPSM currently has about 220 branches, and plans to increase this
number by at least a further 130 over the next five years.

Raising cash for the expansion programme - the price tag was not
revealed - will be done in three ways according to Luis Champalimaud.
Firstly, BPSM will embark on an aggressive campaign to increase
deposits. Secondly, the bank plans a Esc20 billion capital increase
over the next two years. Thirdly, funds from a similar sized capital
increase in Mundial Confianca will be transferred to the bank.

Luis Champalimaud dismissed worries concerning overbanking: "It is true
that in some places there is, or could be, too high a concentration of
bank branches, but at the end of the day it's a case of survival of the
fittest - and we are fitter than most."

Analysts point out that BPSM has a massive potential network of
branches at its disposal via Mundial Confianca and add that the
conversion of any number of these insurance offices into allfinanz
branches could be done at a minimum cost. "Banco Mello is expanding on
the back of insurer Imperio in precisely this manner," said Jose Freire
at Banco Espirito Santo.

The move would also aid BPSM's overstaffing problems - when Banco
Comercial Portugues bid for BPSM last year, it said it would slash
BPSM's workforce by at least a third - because existing employees can
be relocated to new branches, avoiding a big and expensive recruitment
campaign.

As Luis Champalimaud said:"We have too many staff at the moment. That
means that we either reduce the number or we find work for them to do.
We are opting for the latter."

The Champalimaud family is also looking to expand in other areas and
has made public its interest in acquiring the 26 percent indirect stake
held by Banco Espanol de Credito in Banco Totta & Acores, which the
Portuguese government is desperately trying to win back from the
Spanish bank.

CONSULTANTS ARGUE FOR FLEXIBLE BENEFITS

FLEXIBLE BENEFIT programmes can help organisations control costs, but
many companies have yet to realise its advantages, according to
consulting firm Towers Perrin.

The consultancy says flexibility in benefits is on the increase,
particularly when it comes to pensions and company cars, and the
financial industry is leading the way. But it adds that many companies
are unwilling to make their pay and conditions more flexible - because
they believe it will increase administrative costs.

Towers Perrin's conclusions are based on a survey of 400 UK companies
employing 2 million staff, carried out in conjunction with the
Confederation of British Industry.

Helen Freeman, a Towers Perrin principal, said: "Motivations to
implement benefit flexibility centre on either or both of the
following: the desire to improve employees' appreciation of the
benefits provided, maximising the value to the company of the amount
spent on benefits; and the desire to control benefit costs."

Twenty nine percent of the companies in the survey were in the
financial services industry and Towers Perrin found that in the banking
and insurance sector there is greater employee choice in compensation
packages, particularly when it comes to pensions. For example, 24
percent of the financial companies surveyed offered pension benefits on
a flexible basis, compared with 17 percent of non-financial companies.

This may be because the financial sector has a better understanding of
pensions and greater access to a wider range of pension schemes.

"Many companies do not consider pensions appropriate for flex and may
be missing an opportunity to address one of the most expensive employee
benefit programmes they offer," Freeman said.

When it comes to company cars, 74 percent of financial companies
offered employees a choice between a car and cash, compared with 62
percent of non-financial companies. Eighty percent of financial
companies allowed employees to chose a higher value car by contributing
towards the cost of it, an option available to only 56 percent of
non-financial firms.

"The trend towards flexibility within car and pension arrangements may
reflect the fact that these are often the highest-cost employee
benefits," said Freeman. "Companies may be recognising that, if flex is
to have a significant cost-containment effect, these benefits must be
included."

Other areas of possible flexibility within compensation packages
include: company parking; subsidised cafeteria; luncheon vouchers;
subsidised health club memberships; company gyms; annual health
screening; dental care; private petrol allowances; travelling expenses;
share ownership; group discounts; employee, accident insurance; loans;
subsidised mortgages; school fees; company creches; and child care
vouchers.

The survey found that on-site creches and child care vouchers were the
least popular forms of supplementary benefit offered to employees,
available at only 7 percent and 5 percent of companies respectively.

Towers Perrin also found that giving employees greater choice about
their length of annual holidays is also unpopular, though companies in
the financial sector are a little more flexible on this issue.

"Few companies allow or intend to allow employees either to buy or sell
holidays in exchange for cash or other benefits," said Freeman. "This
may be because allowing employees to sell holidays is a cash cost to
the company, which may not be made up in increased productivity.
However, 57 percent of respondents do allow employees to carry forward
unused holiday (72 percent of financial companies) and 37 percent of
respondents overall allow employees to take unpaid time off to extend
their holiday."

Reviewing the survey, Freeman concluded: "Cost containment within
private medical programmes is emerging as an issue, presumably because
of recent double-digit increases in health-care costs. Benefits with
little or no cost to companies (such as parking and supplemental
disability insurance) are increasingly included in benefit programmes.

"However, despite the increase in benefits flexibility, and in its
perceived advantages, companies continue to express concern.
Administrative complexity and cost tops the list of perceived
disadvantages. This concern must be weighed against the advantages. It
is the experiences of companies who implement flex that will determine
whether a role for this approach is secured more broadly within benefit
programmes."

Another Towers Perrin principal, Marc Hommel, went even further: he
sees flexible benefits as one of the main trends in employee
compensation for the future.

"It is very new. It is going to increase," he said. "I would say the UK
is between the US and Continental Europe when it comes to progress in
this area. In the US, there is very high flexibility and choice in
benefits, under the banner of employee empowerment.

"On the continent, it is right on the other extreme. There, companies
are seen as much more paternalistic. Employees like their employers to
make all sorts of decisions for them. For example, in France, when it
comes to holidays, it is August or nothing. In countries like Germany
the only flexibility on pensions is whether you accept a lump sum or an
annuity, there is greater flexibility on pensions in the UK.

"But we are beginning to see things change on the continent. That is
being driven by recession and high cost of employment. The employment
costs currently experienced by European firms is unsustainable.

"Unions and works councils have been very anti-choice - they are into
collective bargaining and agreements made with works councils in
Holland, Germany, Belgium and France cover very senior employees. But
the workforce is changing and we are seeing an end to the job for life.

"We are beginning to see larger German companies looking at cost
control. They want to reduce costs but not loose employee appreciation.
Rather than provide all employee benefits en masse, you can offer a
choice. Offering choice makes you an attractive employer at very little
extra cost."

PUTTING AN END TO RECRUITMENT HASSLE?

NEW SOFTWARE developed by a Californian company may reduce recruitment
headaches for human resource executives.

Resumix, a world leader in electronic systems used for processing
application forms and resumes, recently announced partnership
agreements with Oracle, ADP, RAMCO Systems, Integral, Decisis, ESSENCE
Systems and Worksmart- Technologies.

A new Resumix product, known as OpenAccess, was the catalyst for the
partnerships. OpenAccess is a set of flexible computer interface tools
which help automate and synchronise data exchange between the Resumix's
processing systems and other human resource management systems (HRMSs).

Resumix spokesman Joseph Hnilo explained that OpenAccess will make
databases more easily accessible to HR system suppliers. Resumix's own
knowledge base contains over 100,000 rules and concepts related to
recruitment in specific industries, he said.

"The Resumix knowledge base applies an objective standard of
measurement to job candidates, and can therefore eliminate the
subjectivity in the selection process," Hnilo said.

"Our system is not designed to tell people who to hire. But we enable
recruiters to quickly and accurately assess candidates' skills and
qualifications - that helps companies save time and money."

The Resumix system standardises job applications and resumes by
categorising candidates' previous job titles and assigning numerical
values to candidates' skills. Client firms can enter their hiring needs
into the Resumix system to find the best matched candidate for a
particular position. It is a process which, according to Hnilo, takes
only minutes.

Job candidates' resumes can be scanned into a database using fax or
electronic mail. The system then captures an exact electronic image of
the resume, making the recruitment process "paperless".

Paperless recruitment has decided advantages for human resource
departments in large US companies, as many receive thousands of
applications for hundreds of different jobs every year and each resume
must be kept on file for a set period of time. For example, Californian
state law requires companies to keep resumes for every job application
for at least two years.

Once a job application has been scanned into the Resumix system, a text
file is created so that it can be transmitted anywhere electronically.
The system also automatically extracts information from job
applications, including listed skills and work experience, without the
need for additional data entry by client companies.

Resumix is currently targeting the financial services industry, and its
list of clients includes Bank of America, ITT Hartford, Salomon
Brothers, Principal Mutual Life Insurance, Wells Fargo Bank, and
American Express.

Founded in 1988, the company sold its services mainly to high-tech
firms during its first three years of operations. Now its market
includes the financial services industry, telecommunications companies,
universities and colleges and even manufacturers.

"Banking has a lot of similarities to many of our earlier users," said
Hnilo. "Like high tech companies, banking requires a great degree of
skill specificity, from portfolio managers to tellers.

"Our system can help banks in re-engineering efforts. For example,
banks can apply the software internally, to analyse their current
employees in terms of matching them to future projects and planning."

Noting that the bigger international banks are moving aggressively into
Asia and Latin America, Hnilo added: "The system can also be used by
banks or insurers who are expanding into new technology or geographic
markets, to find staff for their new locations."

Because it works with many different data entry systems, Resumix
OpenAccess allows recruitment data to be freely imported from HRMSs,
E-mail, electronic kiosks, application forms scanning systems, and
groupware such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange.

This versatility attracted its current list of marketing partners,
including another Californian company, Oracle, who is a leading
supplier of human resource solutions. Resumix's OpenAccess will operate
with Oracle's Cooperative Application Initiative (CAI) programme,
creating a resume scanning and processing system that will be offered
with Oracle's HRMS.

Oracle's vice-president of Migration Services and Worldwide Alliance,
Marc Herbert, said the Resumix partnership will enable his company to
provide "fast and effective management and deployment of human
resources to help companies react quickly and respond appropriately to
changes and opportunities in today's demanding market."

Automatic Data Processing (ADP) will market Resumix to interface with
its HR software. ADP, America's largest provider of outsourced payroll
processing services, selected Resumix to enhance its human resource
management systems.

ADP's director of Strategic Alliances, Elaine Myrback, said her company
was impressed with "both the functionality of the Resumix system and
the flexibility of its data exchange capabilities".

A private company, Resumix posted a 130 percent revenue growth from
1992 to 1993, and its financial services base, according to Hnilo, now
stands at"5 percent and growing".

TAPPING ASIA'S MASSIVE POOL OF TALEN

Banks and insurance companies may find it easier to recruit bilingual
employees in their fast growing Asian markets, thanks to a database
being developed by a US recruitment company.

International Career Information (ICI) of New Jersey, claims that its
database of bilingual Asian college students in the US in unique.  The
database holds details on 25,000 undergraduate students from countries
including Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam and Thailand, who are all studying at US
universities.

The database's customers include retail banks Citibank and National
Westminster Bank, and investment banks such as Bankers Trust and
Goldman Sachs.

According to ICI's director of operations, Wayne Allen, the database
can be tailored to meet the companies' specific hiring needs for a fee
raning from $1,500 to $3,000. Clients can be provided with a list of
possible job candidates including details on their natinalities, their
educational achievement and work experience.

"A bank, for example, can select a certain subject major, such as
finace, computer or technology major," Allen said.  "Once we receive
the criteria from the bank, we can send each qualified student a
targeted, proactive notice, making them aware of the bank's interest in
their qualifications".

Allen explained that ICI is the international arm of a Japanese
recruitment firm, Recruit Company, and has traditionally kept track of
Japanese graduate and undergraduate students studying in the US.
However, duirng the past two years, ICI has widened its remit to track
the progress of all Asian students in the US.

Now the company is developing a database on mid-career executives
interested in returning to Asia, Alled said.

A recent ICI survey of 2,300 Asians studying in the US revealed that a
large majority - 89 per cent - preferred to work for a foreign
multinational rather than an Asian-based firm.  This, according to
Allen, creates an opportunity for US and European banks and insurers
that want to recruit the best staff for their new Asian operations.

Most of the leading US financial houses, including JP Morgan, Merrill
Lynch, Citibank and Chase Manhattan, are rushing to establish offices
in the fast-growing economies of Singapore, Thailand and China.

US insurance companies are also moving agressively into the region.
Jeffrey Malkovsky, vice-president and chief financial officer of CIGNA
International, predicted that Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and
Thailand will offer the greatest near-term opportunities for insurance
companies.

Allen contends that ICI is well placed to meet the requirements of
multinationals in Asia.

The company unveiled its database system at the Pan Asia MBA Job Fair
last September in New York, where it linked up a personal computer with
one in Singapore.  The cross-Pacific link-up allowed corporate
recruiters in Singapore to interview Asian students attending the job
fair.

ICI plans a similar intercontinental link-up at the Pan Asian
Engineering and Computer Science Job Fair, which is scheduled for
February 24 in San Jose, California

TRAINING KIT KEEPS FUTURE LEADERS INDOORS

OUTDOOR PURSUIT exercises have long been recognised as valuable
training methods, particularly in developing leadership and teamworking
ability - but the days of military style exercises in the great
outdoors may be numbered.

Outdoor pursuits are expensive in terms of money and staff time.
Another drawback, particularly in the middle of winter, is that not
every prospective business leader reacts favourably to the prospect of
several days living in the wilds. Plus there is the risk of losing
valuable staff time through injury or illness caused by exposure to the
elements.

Now UK consulting firm Martin Thompson Associates has developed a more
comfortable and less costly alternative. It is a large scale
construction kit, similar to oversized pieces of Lego or Mecanno, that
can be used indoors and outdoors.

The kit, a collection of plastic pipes, joints, platforms and wheels,
weighing 22kg and packed in two bags each measuring 30 x 42 x 55 cm,
was originally developed by name partner Martin Thompson two years ago
as a way of marketing his consultancy services. Since then, the kit has
taken on a product life of its own.

"We only expected to sell about 50 a year," Thompson said. "In the last
two years, we have sold 500. Our international sales include sales to
France, Switzerland, Germany, India, Dubai, Hong Kong and Canada."

In the UK, the list of clients includes: Abbey National, Barclays,
Lloyds Bank, Hill Samuel and Zurich Life.

The kit is "all you want from a training resource", said Shaun Lang, a
training centre manager with Yorkshire Bank. "I would unreservedly
recommend the resource to anyone involved in the training and
development of managers and leaders."

Colin Keast of Hill Samuel also described it as "the best #480" that
his firm had spent on a training resource.

Thompson has developed six training exercises using the kit, he claims
that each exercises raises basic leadership and teamwork issues,
including: listening, planning, decision making, giving and receiving
commitment.

Additionally, Thompson claims that each of the exercises, focuses on a
specific area: customer orientation; team objectives versus individual
objectives; inter-group working; communications; roles of team members
and leader empowerment; and negotiating win/win solutions.

For example, one of the exercises, Over The Bridge, calls on a team to
build a bridge and a vehicle that can pass over it. But teams must be
aware of customer needs and wants, and should ideally ask their
training facilitator for customer criteria.

"It is amazing how many teams - particularly those from a marketing
background - who assume that there may be any limitations on what the
vehicle may be use for or what kind of span the bridge must cross,"
Thompson said."Typically, people do not ask questions, they do
everything from a straight forward production point of view and have no
concept of what the customer required. In the discussion afterwards,
the importance of the customer is really brought home to them."

A group discussion lead by a trainer follows each exercise and
participants are encouraged to spend time individually considering how
the lessons learnt can be applied effectively in their place of work.

EUROPE: BANK STAFF FALL DOWN ON FUND TRANSFERS

BANK BRANCH staff in Luxembourg, the UK and Italy are the most
competent in Europe when it comes to arranging cross-border payments
and money transfers, according to research carried out for the European
Commission.

Surprisingly, bank staff in the Netherlands - a country with a
distinguished history in foreign trade and whose people are
traditionally regarded as the most multilingual in Europe -scored the
worst, with a rating of "below adequate".

The survey of 352 branches of 165 banks was carried out by UK
consultancy Retail Banking Research on behalf of the commission, which
wanted to gauge the transparency of banking charges and conditions when
consumers transfer money from one European Union member state to
another.

The commission believes transparency in cross-border banking is vital
to the future of Europe. It stated recently: "The full benefits of the
single market will only be achieved if it is possible to transfer money
as rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the [EU] to another."

Based on the results of the survey and an earlier one carried out in
1993, the commission has decided to introduce a directive in October
that would help regulate the area and improve banks' results in the
field.

That directive was opposed by the European Banking Federation, which
wanted the banking community to have its own voluntary code of conduct.
But the commission has put its foot down, after Retail Banking Research
found widespread double charging for cross-border fund transfers.

In 36 percent of cases, recipients were charged by intermediary and/or
beneficiary banks, though fund transfer instructions stated that all
fees had already been paid by the fund originators.

The European Banking Federation's general secretary, Nikolaus Bomcke,
claimed that double charging is an unavoidable part of sending
international payment. He said most sending institutions warned
customers that they could not guarantee that a charge would not be
levied on fund receivers. "We do not control the transfer chain," he
said. "Clearly, there is room for improvement, but I believe strongly
in a market solution."

Whether a market solution can solve the dismal performance of Dutch
banks remains to be seen. Banking staff in the Netherlands were found
to be the worst in Europe when it came to general helpfulness. And they
were the second worst when it came to providing customers with
information about the various options available for transferring funds
across borders; how long a transfer might take; and how much it would
cost.

The survey found that many Dutch banks "were reluctant to give cost
information to the researcher, since he did not have an account with
the bank".

Bank staff in Luxembourg scored the best when it came to providing
customers with the options available to them, the time it would take to
complete a transfer; and their overall helpfulness. But, amazingly,
"branch staff often misquoted costs. Many misread brochure details,
others omitted to mention that an exchange commission was payable".

UK branch staff scored the best when it came to quoting charges - but
they benefited from a very simple flat fee charging system, with each
bank's charges ranging from Ecu15 ($18) to Ecu45 for urgent transfers,
and Ecu10 to Ecu26 for standard transfers.

British banks also warned fund originators that electing to pay
beneficiary charges did not guarantee that the amount sent would be
credited to the beneficiary's account without further deductions. One
branch staffer told a researcher "Spanish banks charge the beneficiary
even if the sender requests to pay all costs."

"Virtually all" UK branches said they would be able to trace a
transfer, if delays occurred. In many other countries, branch staff
denied that transfers sometimes were lost in the system.

When researchers approached bank counters in Belgium, Denmark, Spain,
France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the first member of
staff contacted handled the inquiry most cases. Which points to a
greater level of staff training and work flexibility in those seven
countries.

In the five other EU countries, researchers were more frequently
referred to another member of staff, or a specialist department.
Researchers were asked to make an appointment to carry out their
transaction in only three countries - in 5 percent of cases in France,
4 percent in Portugal, and 2 percent in Italy.

MIDLAND GAINS STRENGTH FROM DIVERSITY

Midland Bank was singled out for praise by the UK Equal Opportunities
Commission for its policies aimed at ending discrimination in the work
place. Cian Molloy looks at some of the bank's initiatives

CYNICS MAY describe equal opportunity statements as empty words - but
not at Midland Bank where UK regulators have praised its equal
opportunity schemes.

The bank has a dedicated equal opportunities department with human
resource executives in charge of equal opportunities in gender, race
and disability.

There are good business reasons for their approach, according to
Midland's equal opportunities executive on race, Andie Constantinides.
"Equal opportunities is about diversity and reflecting the community,"
she said. "The more our staff reflect the community they are working
in, the more they will understand that community and the services that
our customers need.

"Diversity also helps teams. Decision making is better when the people
making decisions come from different backgrounds. Every individual has
their own thing to bring to an organisation. The more diverse the
individuals in an organisation, the more diverse the skills and
qualities that they will bring."

Official Midland policy states: "We seek to employ a workforce which
reflects the diverse community at large, because we value the
individual contribution of people, irrespective of sex, age, marital
status, disability, sexuality, race, colour, religion, ethnic or
national origin.

"We will treat all Midland employees with dignity and respect and we
will provide a working environment free from unlawful discrimination,
victimisation or harassment."

The bank goes further to state that if any act by an employee breaches
its equal opportunities policy, the matter "will be taken seriously, be
fully investigated, and may be subject to disciplinary procedures".

Indeed, Midland has become so competent in investigating cases of
alleged discrimination or harassment, that the bank is now marketing
its training courses in investigating complaints of racial and sexual
harassment.

The bank has its own Disability Equality Action Group which meets
regularly. It is a panel of disabled employees who provide management
with feedback on issues affecting disabled people.

To encourage job applications from members of ethnic minorities Midland
has been running a fellowship programme since 1991 where final year
college students are offered work experience placements during their
summer holidays. Midland audits its graduate selection process for
equal opportunity purposes and in 1993 16 percent of its graduate
intake came from ethnic minority backgrounds.

At present 5 percent of Midland's domestic workforce are from ethnic
minority backgrounds. The bank regularly holds "focus groups" with its
ethnic minority staff to identify new initiatives in this area and to
get feedback about their experience of working for the bank.

The director of the equal opportunities unit, Anne Watts, is also a
founder member of a new government-funded initiative, Race for
Opportunity, being set up later this year. Race for Opportunity will be
similar to another national initiative, Opportunity 2000, which is
aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of women in the British
workplace by the end of the century.

Midland was also involved in the launch of Opportunity 2000 in 1991.
Now women represent 21.5 percent of all managers, compared with only
7.5 percent ten years ago.

Like most British banks, the majority of Midland's part-time staff are
women, 96 percent. But even part-timers who fit their hours of work
around school schedules can run into home care or baby-sitting
difficulties during school holidays. Because of this, the bank runs
holiday play schemes in 40 different locations dotted around the
country.

"Play schemes form a natural extension to the bank's nursery provision,
allowing employees to work during school holidays, confident that their
children are being looked after in a caring and creative environment,"
said Watts. "The rationale is the same as with Midland's nurseries -
the recruitment and retention of high calibre experienced staff in a
cost effective manner."

The bank does not subsidise its holiday play schemes, but it provides
nursery facilities in partnerships with public sector organisations and
staff, with a satisfactory performance rating, have access to over 100
nurseries.

"Although the strategy is business driven, the implementation is wholly
child centred. Children with special needs will be accommodated
wherever possible," said Watts.

"The provision of nurseries has had an impact on retention of staff. In
1989, only 30 percent of women returned after maternity leave, but by
1993 this figure had risen to 75 percent. The profile of this group
shows that typically they have worked for the bank for at least ten
years, have received a considerable amount of training and are
experienced and effective employees. This represents retention of a
very valuable resource."

Five days a year of family leave are available to all employees with
emergency caring responsibilities. Family leave covers care of sick
children and other sick or disabled dependents, recognising that with
Britain's ageing population more staff members are caring for elderly
relatives.

As well as getting the best from staff, Midland's equal opportunities
are also aimed at improving customer service.

Midland's marketing department has appointed a manager to develop
business with ethnic minorities and the bank also runs a training
course for managers to heighten their awareness of ethnic minority
business issues. The bank is also running a pilot scheme in six of its
branches aimed at improving the service offered to ethnic minority
customers.

During customer focus training staff are taught how to welcome disabled
customers and Midland is a member of Britain's Employers Forum on
Disability.

Induction loop systems have been installed in all of the bank's
branches to help hearing aid users and copies of customer brochures are
available in braille, large print, and on audio cassettes versions for
those with loss of vision.

A COLLECTION OF FAMILIAR TALES

Job cuts were again a recurring theme in the financial services
industry last year. Cian Molloy looks back at these and other human
resources issues that made the headlines in 1994

JANUARY

EIGHT SENIOR executives of Gota Bank in Scandinavia were taken to court
by the Bankstodsnamnden, the government's bank support authority.

Gota Bank was one of the bank's worst hit by the Scandinavian banking
crisis and the government was seeking damages for losses caused by poor
lending decisions made in 1990.

The previous year, the bank support authority had threatened Nordbanken
with similar legal action, but that case was settled out of court.

BARCLAYS BANK in the UK implemented its first major compulsory
redundancy scheme in the bank's history.

WORKERS AT Spain's fifth-largest bank, Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto), were promised there would be no drastic job cuts in the
foreseeable future.

The promise was made by Banesto's new chairman, Alfredo Saenz, after
the bank was taken over by Spain's central bank at the end of December
1993.

FEBRUARY

US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton gave his support to calls for international
agreements strengthening workers' bargaining powers.

While on a visit to Europe, Clinton praised the European Social Charter
and expressed the view that some of its provisions should be extended
to workers in the Third World. "We must create more jobs," he said.
"But if more jobs involve giving up standards for which people have
fought for in the past, this could be very dangerous. It could result
in the collapse of the middle class or working class in our countries."

A THREE-year pay deal was agreed in Ireland between the government, the
Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Employers and
Business Confederation.

The deal covered bank staff because the Irish Bank Officials
Association (IBOA) is now a member of the ICTU. IBOA general secretary
Ciaran Ryan was elected to the ICTU's executive in 1993.

The IBOA joined the ICTU following its traumatic strike action in 1992
when many IBOA members crossed official union pickets and banks were
able to keep branches open, thanks to new technology. Previously, while
outside the ICTU, the IBOA had been successful in winning pay increases
higher than those achieved by unions in other sectors.

PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE Company of America launched a multi-media
interactive training scheme, claiming it would improve staff
recruitment, selection and retention.

AMERICA'S SECOND-largest bank, Chase Manhattan, offered a stock option
to all its employees as part of a performance based reward scheme.

Every employee were to receive an option on 400 shares, priced $35.50
each, but the shares were unavailable for purchase unless certain
performance-based conditions were met.

The bank's chairman Thomas Labreque said: "The option grant will align
the interests of our worldwide staff and stockholders, and provide
employees with a strong incentive to perform at levels that exceed
stockholders expectations."

MARCH

SPAIN'S THIRD-largest bank, Banco Central Hispano (BCH), announced a
staff reduction and branch closure programme aimed at cutting running
costs by Pta85 billion ($700 million) over five years.

It is planned that about 3,000 staff will be shed and 400 of the banks
2,700 branches will be closed by the end of 1995. The bank was formed
in 1991 through the merger of Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamerica.
At the time of the merger, the bank employed 31,472 people and analysts
calculated that it was overstaffed by as much as 40 percent.

Between 1991 and 1994, 750 branches were closed and 5,000 jobs shed
through early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.

THE NUMBER of Americans who telecommute - work from home using
computers linked to their offices - increased to 8 million, double the
number in 1990.

Improved technology, the Los Angeles earthquake, and bad weather on the
east coast of the US were cited as reasons for the increase in
telecommuting.

APRIL

UNICE, THE European employers organisation, reckoned that 3,000
European companies in the financial sector will be affected by the EU
directive on European Works Councils.

The directive affects all companies in the EU which employ more than
1,000 staff members with at least 100 staff members employed in a
second EU state.

HUMAN RESOURCE managers have little effect on the quality of industrial
relations, according to research by the London School of Economics.
After surveying data from the UK's Workplace Industrial Relations
Survey, researchers Sue Fernie, David Metcalfand Stephen Woodland,
concluded that human resource executives" do not improve the climate of
employee-management relations and probably detract from it".

BUT HUMAN resource managers do have a role in preventing employee
fraud, according to a director of an international risk management
consultancy.

Chris Barrett of WBK International said that during fraud
investigations it is often found that staff sense something had been
amiss, but feel they cannot voice their concerns because of
unapproachable management.

"I'm not advocating a police state," Barrett said, "but simply
suggesting that management should be readily accessible to employees."

Barrett also suggested that human resource managers develop better
systems for detecting changes in employee's personal behaviour,
including unexplained new-found wealth or increasingly frequent visits
to casinos. "By far the biggest category of employee fraudster is the
previously honest employee facing a change in the circumstances of
their lives," he said.

MAY

AN HRBI survey of European branch opening hours found that Turkish
banks stayed open longest, averaging 46.9 hours a week.

Banks in nearby Cyprus had Europe's shortest opening hours, averaging
only 21.3 hours a week. Swiss banks were ranked second with 42.6 hours
a week, while Poland with 41.9 hours, the Netherlands with 39.1 hours,
and the UK with 37 hours, were ranked third, fourth and fifth.

PAY RISES for bank staff in the UK were higher than the national
average in the first quarter of 1994.

Bank personnel saw their pay packets increase by an average of 2.6
percent in the first three months of the year, compared with a national
average for the private sector of 2.4 percent, according to the
Confederation of British Industry. The biggest wage increase was at
Lloyds Bank where the average increase based on merit was 4.5 percent.

BANC ONE Corporation in the US announced a plan to cut its running
costs by hundreds of millions of dollars without resorting to layoffs.

Banc One's chairman John McCoy said the bank planned to save $150
million in 1994 and $200 million in 1995 by using new technology to
streamline back office operations. But he added that Banc One would
redeploy staff instead of laying them off. "For example, we see an
increasing demand in retail credit, with a downturn in mortgage
financing. Therefore, we will move now to redeploy the workforce
towards retail credit, and away from refinancing."

JUNE

A SPANISH bank was left reeling by head hunters after it lost ten of
its most senior executives.

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) was robbed of some of its most valuable
employees following Banco Santander's acquisition of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto).

The BBV executives had been seconded for four months to Banesto while
it was being administered by the Bank of Spain. Poaching the BBV staff
after buying Banesto had obvious advantages for Banco Santander as the
move caused little disruption to Santander's management hierarchy and
the head-hunted staff all have experience of running the newly
purchased bank.

METROPOLITAN LIFE, one of the biggest insurance companies in the US,
shed 1,000 of its 13,000 salesforce after being fined $20 million for
mis-selling life insurance policies.

CREDIT LYONNAIS, the troubled French bank, announced plans to shed 10
percent of its workforce over three years in a move to boost
productivity. The bank's president Jean Peyrelevade set a target for
zero growth in running expenses in 1994.

SEPTEMBER

ITALIAN BANKS were hit by strike action following a break-down in talks
between employers and trade unions about the financial industry's
annual collective agreement.

Assicredito, the bank employers' federation, offered a monthly pay
increase of L83,000 ($53), but that was not good enough for the trade
unions who demanded a monthly increase of L128,000 backdated to January
1993.

THE BRITISH Bankers' Association claimed that banks were no longer
cutting their branch networks. These conclusions were based on a
comparison with 1993 which showed little change. But in the last decade
Barclays had closed 700 branches, Lloyds closed 400, Midland 600 and
National Westminster 700.

OCTOBER

AMERICAN EXPRESS said it planned to shed 6,000 staff in the next two
years.

The move, which involved compulsory redundancies, was aimed at cutting
the company's costs by $500 million a year. Most of the staff affected,
4,000, were US based. Out of the 2,000 employees being shed worldwide,
400 were in Europe working in support functions including legal, public
relations, and human resource offices.

Amex chairman Harvey Golub said: "These efforts will build a stronger,
more successful organisation that will move us closer to achieving our
vision of becoming the world's most respected service brand."

FORTIS AMEV launched a performance pay scheme for its back office
staff.

The Dutch parent of the Fortis insurance and banking group, Fortis AMEV
already had a profit share scheme in operation. The new performance pay
scheme, payable this summer, could be worth up to 15 percent of salary
for some employees.

TSB BECAME one of the first UK financial institutions to switch its
insurance salesmen from commission-based income to salaries in advance
of new disclosure rules coming into operation in the UK at the start of
1995.

TSB ALSO said it was closing 17 percent of its branch network over a
12-month period. The UK's eighth-largest bank by assets had already
closed 100 outlets in 1994 when it announced that another 200 branches
were to close to cut its total number of branches to 1,000.

John Townsend of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union said he
believed TSB was aiming to prune its network further to 800 branches.

NOVEMBER

ITALIAN BANKS and trade unions signed a four-year collective agreement
after a long-running industrial dispute.

Naturally, both sides claimed victory. Assicredito, the bankers'
federation, won concessions on hiring part-time workers, opening hours
and the use of annual bonuses which were brought in line with
productivity and bank profitability. The unions won bonuses for staff
who work Saturdays and an agreement that 12 percent of vacancies would
be kept for bank personnel who are "between jobs".

ABN AMRO, the biggest bank in the Netherlands, was caught by surprise
when a leaked report from its works council claimed the bank needed to
shed 5,000 staff in the next three years.

The bank had said earlier in the year that it planned to shed only
2,100 workers in three years or 2,800 workers over four years.

STAFF SUGGESTIONS at Midland Bank saved the company #250,000 ($400,000)
in one year, it was revealed after the bank's suggestion scheme won
praise from the UK's Industrial Society.

THE SPANISH insurer AGF-Union y el Fenix said it needed to shed 35
percent of its workforce as part of its recovery plan.

The company was faced with a great deal of staff duplication following
the merger of AGF Seguros and Union y el Fenix in June.

DECEMBER

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank became the first UK bank to open its branches
on a Sunday.

Twenty three NatWest branches, each offering a full counter service,
opened on the two Sundays before Christmas - a move which took the
bank's nearest rivals Barclays, Midland and Lloyds by surprise.

Though the move was described as "a trial", the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union claimed it was a prelude to seven-day opening throughout
the year.

TRADE UNIONS took one of the world's most profitable banks to court
last month claiming their new code of conduct infringed civil
liberties.

Banco Popular Espanol, Spain's biggest bank, was taken to court by the
Commissiones Obreras and the Union General de Trabajadores.

The code prohibits staff from living outside the town or village where
they work; no bank employee should act as a guarantor for a loan; and
no close family member of an employee should set up a business
enterprise. The code also states that"the bank does not encourage
friendship between managerial staff and the bank's clients or between
bank staff themselves".

DEUTSCHE BANK said it planned to freeze personnel costs in its domestic
banking business in 1995 - but its vice-president and head of personnel
Christoph Woehrmann told HRBI that he wondered if the target was
achievable.

Woehrmann said the bank planned to shed less-qualified clerks,
particularly in payment transactions and branch operations, by using
improved technology.

THE FOURTH-largest bank in the US, Chemical Bank, said it was shedding
3,700 employees, or 9 percent of its workforce. The move was aimed at
raising its return on equity from 14 percent to 16 percent.

DON'T FIRE ALL YOUR BRANCH STAFF YET

Conventional wisdom has it that the branch network's days are numbered,
that the future lies in ATMs and direct banking. Not so, says David
Rhodes, a believer in reconfiguration, rather than eliminatation

REPORTS OF the death of the branch are very much exaggerated. But, like
anything else, bank branches need to be evolved, to be reconfigured and
used in an effective way.

If you believe some commentators, traditional networks will be swept
away by the combinations of telecommunications and technology which
will create the virtual bank. Specialist competitors, such as mutual
fund companies, will pick over the bones that are left and customers
will desert those few remaining branches in droves.

But let me take you back in time and across Europe to East Germany. The
Berlin Wall has just come down. Imagine a bank in the town of Leipzig -
let us call it "Bank A" - with $4 billion of assets, 1,300 employees
and 67 branches. Some 400,000 customers, all in Leipzig, give the bank
a 67 percent market share.

Well, when the wall came down the bank found that life would never be
the same. Big, successful, modern banks such as Deutsche and Dresdner
moved into Leipzig with their bright, more customer-focused branches.
So the bank conducted some research among its customers - Chart 1 shows
the results.

"Bank A" is ahead in only two areas - low fees and convenient branches.
So, what do you think happened to this bank? What do you think happened
to market share? What do you think happened to profits? What on earth
do you do to fix all this?

Needless to say, one suggestion would be to close branches. Across
Europe many bankers say branches are becoming obsolete. They argue
there are too many branches and they are being made redundant by
automatic teller machines (ATMs), the telephone, cards and video
technology.

The Big Four in the UK, for example, have closed almost a quarter of
their branches in the last ten years. Midland, the most aggressive, has
cut 30 percent of its network. Midland, incidentally, has stated
publicly that it does not intend to cut any more and here are my views
why.

Imagine your business as a healthy tree. However healthy it is, it
cannot survive continual cutting of its branches. Banks are no
different. If you cut branches you lose customers and balances, you
lose a critical recruitment tool, you actually only achieve limited
cost savings. You lose cross-selling opportunities and so you lose
contribution and suffer reduced profitability. Let us look at why these
statements are true.

Chart 2 shows that more and more customers are shared with competitors.
In a world with fewer exclusive customers and more competition, you
need to think very carefully before you take away a critical
recruitment and service delivery point. In the UK, 75 percent of
customers have relationships with more than one institution, and while
a typical bank has 80 percent of the loans held by its customers, it
only achieves 20 percent share of their mortgages and 30 percent share
of their deposits.

At the moment, in the UK at least, branches are still heavily visited.
Fifty percent of customers visit their branch more than two to three
times a month. Only 10 percent never visit their branch.

But why do customers like to visit their branches? One reason is that
they are not always as eager to embrace technology as we would like
them to be.

Recent UK research found that 40 percent of customers preferred to
withdraw cash in person. This is only partly to do with age, another
reason is mistrust of machines. In Britain, there have been well
publicised cases of phantom withdrawals. This is a behavioural and
attitudinal issue that cuts across all socio-economic and demographic
segments. The mistrust of machines is even higher when it comes to
depositing cash and cheques. Finally, over 80 percent of respondents
prefered face to face financial advice, largely because advice is about
relationship and trust.

The research also showed that some customers prefer remote technology
solutions for some transactions. Any branch banking strategy needs to
reflect the fact that large numbers of customers prefer the telephone
or ATMs for some of those transactions. There is also the classic
dilemma of people not knowing that they want something until of course
you give it to them. But I do think that it is important to remember
that personal contact is central to all banking relationships.

There is another reason why branch closures may not be an attractive
option. Location is the number one reason why people choose a bank. In
the UK nearly 90 percent of people bank within ten minutes of where
they live or work.

Recruiting customers is of little value unless you sell attractive
higher margin products to them. We talk a lot about databases, customer
information files, marketing central information files, and so on. Some
people are enjoying success with these tools but none of them have
dispensed with the branch.

The most crucial aspect of selling is getting branch staff motivated
and trained. To take the example of one of the best European banks in
selling life insurance and pensions, 80 percent of the leads came from
staff talking to customers, only 20 percent came from targeted
marketing using the databases.

If we dissect those leads generated by the branch, 70 percent of the
customers had originally come into the branch just to conduct a
transaction, only 2 percent had come to inquire about life and
pensions. One other point, the conversion rate of leads to sales was
higher for the warm branch-based leads than the cold database-generated
leads.

Let us look at what happens if you do choose to close branches. First
of all, direct cost. In one large European bank less than 5 percent of
branches failed to cover their direct costs. The question is: how many
do you need to close before you can make significant reductions in
central or shared costs?

But calculating the business impact of closing branches is very
difficult. We found that many customers will not move two kilometres to
another one of their existing bank's branches, if a competitor has a
closer branch. We found that within two years of closure a bank is
doing well to have retained two-thirds of the customers from a closed
branch. The only exception, of course, is the merging of two branches
which are virtually adjacent.

Many customers use branch closure as an excuse to move. It crystallises
dissatisfaction and it seems that many of the most attractive customers
defect. Many customers are very traditional in their bank habits, have
large numbers of competitive branches nearby, and resent the upheaval.
Indeed, our analysis shows that closing 20 percent of branches saves
just 2 percent of network costs (Chart 4). That is not enough to solve
anyone's problems.

Yet, we need to recognise that changing channel dynamics will leave
behind any under-used network. As volumes switch from the branch it
seems probable that branch transaction costs will rise by about 15 to
20 percent over the next few years.

The development of the debit card, smart cards, new electronic point of
sale technology, increased ATM functionality, will all reduce the
volume of cheque and cash transactions at the counter - but only by
around 25 percent over the next few years. Equally, the telephone and
ultimately multi-media technology will allow simple sales, inquiries
and transactions such as bill-paying to be removed from the branch.

Of course, consumers will accept technology more and more as they get
used to things like armchair shopping and the greater convenience and
efficiency technology might bring.

But, again, this does not suit everybody. Research has shown that
financial services came around 50th in a list of uses for the
information superhighway. This is partly because the superhighway
cannot be used for physical transactions and partly because consumers
do not want their financial records in what they see as the public
domain.

The solution is reconfiguration - reconfiguration to cut cost, to build
sales and relationship management capability.

A Consumers Association survey of UK retail banking found a very large
gap between customers' expectations of bank staff efficiency and
service and what customers actually get. There is enormous room to
build better customer satisfaction and I want to emphasise the
importance of the branch in delivering service. If we are to justify
keeping branches then we need to provide the level of service that our
customers demand.

Quality is best achieved by fixing the processes by which you deliver
customer service. If you cannot do this, your branches will not achieve
the cross-selling and recruitment potential that justifies them. This
requires setting explicit ambitious customer service targets and
keeping to them.

One bank conducted customer research and concluded, for example, that
counter wait times should be restricted to less than two minutes in the
branch. When they achieved this the staff saw a man looking lost in the
bank lobby. "What's the matter?" they asked. "I'm worried," he said.
"Is this bank in trouble? There always used to be long lines of people
and now there are none. What's happened to all your customers?"

Another one of the bank's standards was based on new accounts. Account
opening was to take place at a sales desk, not at a teller's counter.
An ATM card and cheque book were to be offered immediately, specific
additional personal information was to be obtained and the customer was
to be given an introduction to some of the bank's other services. The
bank then measured its performance in achieving these things.

This very simple example illustrates a number of things: service
criteria were set in relation to customer needs; the account opening
process was designed to provide a relationship framework, collect
information for future marketing purposes, and to lay the seeds in the
customer's mind of what the bank could offer; and to do this through
personal, rather than through written communication. That is an example
of a bank trying to maximise the benefit of a face-to-face branch
interaction.

The next step in boosting service in an existing branch network is a
complete rethink of the role of the branch.

Someone said to me recently that the relationship between a bank and
its customers was built on trust and that selling products would
destroy that relationship. I have to say that individual must have
little faith either in the products his bank sells, or the staff who
sell them.

If, like me, you believe that branches are your sales outlets, you will
definitely need to recognise the emerging roles of your staff in a
sales-focused branch. The job today - and in the future - is for branch
staff to identify customer needs, to solve customer problems, to lead
the marketing and sales effort. Rather than being accountable for
balancing the books and making sure the cash transactions are done
efficiently.

In the future, branch staff are really going to be accountable for
customer satisfaction and sales. And that means they will need very
different skills from the skills they have today. They will need
greater communication skills dealing with customers -negotiation skills
in a way - and, of course, greater product knowledge. All this implies
that staff must be better trained.

Now, if you achieve this you will be doing a lot better than my next
example: a sort of lost potential used to justify the closure of
branches. It is to do with the cross-sale of mutual funds. In this
bank, 1,350 target customers for mutual funds came into a branch in any
given month. Of those 1,350 customers only 50 were recognised by the
bank staff as potential mutual funds investors; only 15 were approached
to see if they were interested, and only three actually made an
appointment with a sales person.

This was partly because the tellers lacked the confidence and the sales
skills to approach people; they were offered a $100 incentive, yet it
just did not work. Essentially, 99 percent of the market potential was
missed by the branch staff. Changing that would have changed the
branch's economics.

Another role that the tellers can play in reducing branch costs is by
helping customers to use ATMs. If a customer tries to cash a cheque
over the counter, it can be turned into a relationship opportunity
because the teller takes the customer to the ATM and shows them how it
works ie the customer feels that the teller is delivering valuable
assistance. If the teller has the right information in front of them,
they could use the opportunity to look at the customer's account
history and maybe spot an opportunity to suggest certain credit or
investment products. If tellers do not talk to customers, they cannot
create this sort of opportunity. And the opportunity certainly cannot
be created, if the tellers have no branch to work in.

So, what will the branch of the future look like? Well, much of the
back office will have been stripped out of the branch along with the
staff who felt happier doing the administration. Re-engineering will
have streamlined the customer processes at the front end and
centralised the factory processes at the other end into lower cost,
high scale, highly automated and highly efficient processes.

One day, the only processing a branch will do is a little point of sale
inputting before sending all the paperwork to a regional or a national
processing centre. The counter staff will move from an administrative
role to a relationship management and sales role. This will allow
branches to employ fewer, but more flexible staff. This also means that
in future branches will be smaller.

On the left of chart 5 is a picture of the standard format of a UK
bank. In the past, most of the branch space was given over to
administrative activities behind the glass screen. Customers were
crammed into the small area at the front.

On the right of the chart, we see the small branch of the future with a
much more open customer and merchandising area. The administrative
area, once nearly half the branch, is less than a quarter. There is
more automation for the customer, and for the staff, whose paperwork is
nearly eliminated. There is much less space so the branch's running
costs are much lower. This means a bank's physical presence on the high
street can be maintained while cutting costs. With less space needed,
the bank can afford better locations. Supporting these branches will be
a number of remote branded ATMs.

Is fixing the branch network really worthwhile? Well, you may have
wondered what happened to our bank in Leipzig. I am pleased to say that
it still exists. It re-engineered its branch processes and redesigned
its branches. It introduced a relationship and sales culture. It added
ATMs and it introduced a telephone banking service for existing
customers which, incidentally, won a pan-Germany marketing prize. It
kept almost all of its branches.

Two years later the customer survey was repeated and, as chart 6
shows,"Bank A" is now doing better than its competitors in many areas.
