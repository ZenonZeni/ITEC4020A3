Greece/Cyprus</h2>

<ul>


<p>

On June 19, Greece seized a Honduras-flag cargo ship carrying 136

illegal Asian migrants just outside Piraeus.  The mostly Indian and Pakistani

men said they had paid up to $6,000 each to be smuggled into the European Union

for "a better life." <p>

Two Greeks were sentenced to four and one-half years in prison by an Athens

court on November 14 after they were found guilty of using the hearse of Xanthi

Mufti's office to transport illegal immigrants.  The Mufti did not know about

the use of the hearse for smuggling. <p>

Cyprus plans to tighten its laws to allow prison terms of up to three years

for Cypriots employing foreigners without valid work permits.<p>

There are an estimated 30,000 foreigners employed in Cyprus, including

12,000 illegal workers.  Most workers are from Asia or the former USSR and

employed in agriculture or private households as domestics.<p>

"Two Greeks punished for transport illegal immigrants," Xinhua News Agency,

November 14, 1996.  "105 illegal Albanians arrested in Greece," Agence France

Presse, November 1996.  "Slave ship is seized in Piraeus," Lloyds List, June

20, 1996.<p>
