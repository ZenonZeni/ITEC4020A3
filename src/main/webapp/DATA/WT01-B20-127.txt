<TITLE>Guide for authors</TITLE>
<H1>Guide for authors
</H1>
<HR>
The Journal of the International Hemp Association publishes original research, literature reviews and news items on hemp. Contributions concern fibre, seed and resin, and can come from a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, chemistry, ecology, economy and markets, genetic resources and breeding, history, medicine, physiology, phytopathology, products and applications, and technology. Since the readership of the IHA Journal is much broader than for a single-discipline journal, highly specialized terminology should be defined or avoided. The significance of a statement, or the reasoning behind a conclusion, may have to be more fully explained than in a more specialized journal.<P>

Contributions should be written in English and not exceed 10 double-spaced typed pages (ca. 4000 words), longer contributions may be accepted if they can be serialized in two consecutive issues. Authors not fluent in English should have their paper reviewed and checked by a colleague who is fluent.<P>

Manuscripts can be submitted to:
 IHA Journal,<br> Editorial Office,<br> Postbus 75007, 1070 AA<br> Amsterdam, The Netherlands.<br> The preferred medium of submission is on disk with accompanying manuscript in triplicate. <P>

<H4>Units.</H4> Research papers and literature reviews should use the International (SI, or metric) system throughout. <P>

<h4>Title page.</h4> The title page should give the following information: 1) title of the paper; 2) names and addresses of the authors.<P>


<H4>Abstract.</H4> The abstract should be 100 to 250 words suitable for readers from a broad range of disciplines. The abstract should summarize the aim of the work, the methods used, and give the main results and conclusions.<P>

<H4>Structure.</H4>Research papers should be subdivided into four main sections: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion. The last three sections may be subdivided to improve clarity; a Conclusions section may be added if appropriate. The section on Materials and Methods should be succinct, but should contain sufficient detail to enable the reader to deduce what exactly was done. All abreviations and acronyms must be fully defined when first used. Numerical results should be shown in tables or figures.<P>

<h3>References.</h3> Publications are cited in the text by author(s) and date e.g. (Smith 1980). For publications by more than two authors use (first author et al. date). Under references, papers should be cited as follows:<P>

<h4>Book:</h4>

<H4>Part of a book:</H4>

<H3>Manuscript preparation. </H3>

The entire manuscript, including abstract and references, should be typed on one side of standard-size paper, double spaced with all margins 2.5 cm. Starting with the title page, label all pages in the upper righthand corner with the first author's last name and the page number. Do not use hyphens unless the hyphen is part of the word. Tables should fit on one page, be numbered consecutively, and each table should be on a separate sheet. Every figure and table should have an explanatory title, so that it can be understood without reference to the text. For both tables and figures, authors should indicate on the manuscript the preferred position of insertion in the text of the paper. Every table and figure should be mentioned at least once in the text.<P>

<H3>Manuscript submission. </H3>

Manuscripts should be submitted in triplicate to: Editorial Office, IHA Journal, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. All research papers and literature reviews will be carefully refereed for international relevance and quality. Submission of an article is understood to imply that the article is an original contribution that has not been published elsewhere in substantially the same form, and that it is not being considered for publication elsewhere. <P>

<H3>Electronic manuscripts. </H3>

Once a paper is accepted, the preferred medium of submission is on 3.5 inch disk (Macintosh or MS-DOS format), preferably MS word 5.0 or later, with accompanying manuscript. It is important that the file on disk and the printout are identical. Do not allow the word processor to introduce word splits and do not use a 'justified' layout. It is very important that files are saved in the word processor format. If the word processor features the option to save files "in flat ASCII", please do not use it. Please ensure that only the relevant file (one complete article) is on the disk. Also, specify the type of computer and word processing package used and label the disk with the first author's name and the name of the file on the disk.<P>
