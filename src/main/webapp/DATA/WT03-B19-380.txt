The deteriorating health of our forests can be attributed several causes, 
among which air pollution is very important. The most discussed theories 
claim that the main cause of forest damage is both the impact of nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), both of which contribute directly 
and indirectly;  indirectly by affecting the soil, or for NOx, also by 
contributing to the formation of damaging ozone in the forest air.

Transboundary pollution, especially SO2 and NOx, is considered to be the 
major cause of damage to life in thousands of lakes and water courses. 
Scandinavian soils has a limited ability to neutralize acid rain due to 
their thin topsoil layers and lime-deficient bedrock. Runoff from 
acidified soils contain high concentration of aluminium ion which 
can be toxic to fish and other organisms. The mercury content also 
increases in runoff from acidified soils, and this can accumulate in 
fish and in the next steps in fish consumers.
