<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Negotiations With Andean
Block To Continue In Lima</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>MONTEVIDEO. (MP).- </strong>The
second round of negotiations of Mercosur with the Andean
countries, (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Perú and Venezuela) to
create a free trade zone between the two blocks, ended with no progress
reported.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This means that the original idea of
signing a framework agreement next December in Brazil, during the Mercosur
presidential summit will have to wait. The delegations did agree
to continue discussions in Lima next February.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">During the first round of negotiations also
held in Montevideo, the Andean countries were discussing on an individual
&quot;<em>four plus one</em>&quot; basis, but this last time is
was agreed it should be on a block to block basis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bolivia was left out of the new approach
since negotiations, as those with Chile, had been going on for a
long time and were close to an agreement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Differences arose when both sides presented
their own draft of a framework agreement, and the Andean group
insisted on a considerable list of products to be exempted, as
well as a timetable for cutting tariffs considered too slow by
Mercosur.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;<em>They came with high expectations
and not enough reality</em>&quot;, said a member of the Mercosur
delegation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In spite of the no progress situation,
trade between the two blocks is growing: Andean countries exports
to Mercosur reached 2,5 billion US dollars in 1995; 1,27 billion
in 1994; 930 million in 1993 and 861 million in 1992. Mercosur
countries on the other hand exported 3,34 billion US dollars in
1995; 2,7 billion in '94; 2,5 billion in '93 and 2,28 billion in
1992.</font></p>
