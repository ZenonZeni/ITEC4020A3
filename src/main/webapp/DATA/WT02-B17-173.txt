<CENTER><H2>Dedicated Feedstock Supply Systems</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Systems Utilities and independent power producers must have reliable,
abundant supplies of low-cost biomass feedstocks before they build
additional biomass power facilities. Today's biomass power plants
use residues from paper mills, sawmills, wood products manufacturing,
urban wood surpluses (such as tree trimmings or used pallets),
biomass resulting from good forest management practices, orchard
prunings, agricultural by-products, and food processing remains
(such as nut shells). Tomorrow's biomass power plants will be
fueled from dedicated feedstock supply systems that use energy
crops destined for specific facilities.

<P>
Energy crops are trees and grasses selected for high yields and
resistance to drought and pests. Trees are harvested on 5- to
15-year cycles. Most grasses can be harvested one or more times
during the annual growing season and may be baled like hay. Some
annual crops, including grasses, grains, and oilseeds, are already
part of the biomass energy market.
<P>
Tomorrow's feedstocks will
consist of dedicated plantings of fast-growing woody crops such
as willow and poplar trees, and herbaceous crops such as tall
grasses and canes. The Department of Energy is developing hybrid
poplar and other energy crops for these dedicated acres. Establishing
such crop lands dedicated to supplying reliable, low-cost, renewable
fuel will enable biomass power plants to make a substantial contribution
to the nation's electric power supply.
