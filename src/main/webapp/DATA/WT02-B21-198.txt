<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SURVEY.NET FAQ</H2>

Last updated: 01/30/1995

<H3><A NAME="1.0.0">What is SURVEY.NET?</A></H3><H4>

SURVEY.NET is a public service network of servers designed to poll 
users and generate information on demographics, public opinion, 
trends, etc.  SURVEY.NET is based around a customized, ever-evolving 
script engine developed by Michael Perry (wisdom@icorp.net).
<P>
What makes SURVEY.NET special is that users have the ability to 
instantly view the latest results of each questionnaire - upon 
submission of your survey, the system automatically compiles the 
data and generates a new report, adding your responses to the data 
pool.
<P>
The nucleus of SURVEY.NET is the special engine, which has many 
advanced features, including the ability to handle user-specified 
comments (essay-type answers) as well as regular multiple-choice 
responses.  New features are continually being added to the system 
as more is learned from the process of querying users' opinions and 
perspectives.
<P>
But perhaps more important than anything else, the SURVEY.NET site 
represents a location users on the web can go and seek demographics, 
opinions and other information - as well as contribute their own.  
The underlying engine would be useless if the site itself did not 
attract a wide variety of internet participants - and this is an 
aspect that is as critical as anything else - as a result, we strive 
to keep the site vibrant and alive with opinion and controversy in 
order to consistently attract users and keep regulars coming back.  
Each of our surveys is considered a living entity: dynamic; 
sometimes predictable, sometimes chaotic - just like life.  In fact 
it can be facinating to watch the surveys on various events change 
in relation to the events unfolding themselves - the OJ Simpson 
trial survey is a prime example - we captured public opinion before 
and during each of the side's presentation of their case.  The same 
technique will be used to monitor the events leading up to the 1996 
US Presidential election.  When scenarios change which affect public 
opinion, sometimes old surveys will be closed and archived and new 
ones will be opened - to chronicle not only public opinion in 
general, but changes in perspectives through time.
<P>
Unlike other sites, at SURVEY.NET, the users are the true value - if 
they're going to submit information, they should have instant access 
to that information - this is the main reason for making the results 
automatically available - the data collected is for the enjoyment 
and education of everyone - and not something devised under the 
guise of verifying a preset agenda.
<P>
If there is an ulterior motive in all of this, it's nowhere near as 
controversial as our surveys - it is simply to be considered an 
accurate, reliable source of information on public opinion - the 
highest honor we can imagine.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="1.1.0">
Who Runs SURVEY.NET?
</A></H3><H4>

SURVEY.NET is run by Mike Perry, an independant software developer 
and president of Progressive Computer Services (established in 
1986).  Mike has been involved in developing information systems 
since the age of 13, creating sites on systems from Control Data's 
PLATO network, to developing SIGs (Special Interest Groups) on The 
Source (now CompuServe) and other networks long before the Internet 
was conceived.  Mike has been running a BBS since 1979 and has been 
awarded "Editor's Choice" in PC Magazine, as well as numerous other 
honors and endorsements from major publications and writers 
(including John C. Dvorak) for his programming projects.  In the 
area of marketing, demographics and market research, Mr. Perry has 
extensive experience in working with advertising agencies, broadcast 
media and print media - no formal training - just a PhD from the 
University of Reality in association with services provided to a 
plethora of very prominent firms.
<P>
Ok, this is me (Mike) and obviously I'm also the author of this FAQ 
- I hate writing about myself in the third person - it's pretty 
weird, but I'm also not particularly interested in using this forum 
to blow my own horn (I'd rather be judged by my work exclusively), 
but I guess these are valid questions and responses to put in a 
FAQ...
<P>
I run SURVEY.NET.  I guess you could say it's my baby.  It never has 
been profitable, which IMO is probably the true mark of integrity (ha ha
- that's easy to say when you're poor isn't it?). 
Like everybody else out there, I want to make a mark - I want to do 
something important, and SURVEY.NET is something I take great pride 
in.
<P>
I'm associated with Inter Commerce
Corporation, a local internet service provider - 
they have been kind enough to indulge my experimentation and 
attempts to establish this system, and for that I am grateful.  If 
you're looking for an ISP and you're in the area, take a look at 
what they have to offer.  Beyond this friendly suggestion, that's 
about as much influence as you'll see from me or this site with 
respect to my hosts; I might have a link to their homepage 
in places or promos for other local sites, but that's it - anything 
more would in my opinion be inappropriate considering that we're trying 
to make this site as 
objective as possible.

<H3><A NAME="1.2.0">
How does SURVEY.NET work?  What's the methodology in collecting 
information?
</A></H3><H4>

Obviously, the idea of collecting information online in an automated 
manner presents some interesting challenges.  Traditional polls rely 
on a 'human factor' and a supposed 'random sample' from which to 
generate results.  It has been argued that traditional polls could 
be more accurate than the SURVEY.NET system - someone once commented 
that my system was "biased towards those who are willing to 
participate."  That's funny.  I challenge anyone to show me any 
survey which endeavors to collect accurate information which isn't 
as biased.  The scenario doesn't exist.
<P>
Unlike other survey methods, SURVEY.NET is incapable of prejudice.  
Anyone able to participate is welcome to.  There are safeguards to 
protect against 'spamming' however (see later sections of the 
document).
<P>
The ONLY bias or slant in SURVEY.NET demographics is that our 
respondents have access to the Internet's World-Wide-Web.  If you 
want to argue whether this group is representative of any sizeable 
portion of the world society, that's a good topic for debate - but 
not here.  It is my opinion that it's just a matter of time before 
those who have access to the net will represent a major portion of 
the world community.  Aside from that, we can consider SURVEY.NET's 
results to be the opinions of those who are on the Internet with WWW 
access.  And as we speak, this segment is getting larger and larger 
by the minute!
<P>
A typical survey in the system presents a small set of questions - 
usually multiple choice.  The results are automatically compiled 
upon submission of the form.  These answers are then added to a 
"master database" of responses to each question, updated, and then 
the system re-creates a new report (an html page) reflecting the 
latest results.  The answers to each question are sorted based on 
the number of respondents, with the most-popular answer being listed 
first and the least-popular last.
<P>
Enhancements are currently underway to implement special variations 
of surveys which dynamically present new questions based on the 
results of previous answers - a truly dynamic surveying system... 
There are also plans to be able to generate results based on 
specific conditions and responses to specific questions - stay 
tuned...


<H3><A NAME="1.3.0">
How accurate is the SURVEY.NET information?  What about multiple 
users posting answers?
</A></H3><H4>

There are numerous techniques implemented to protect against users 
trying to taint the
survey results by completing surveys more than once.  For me to 
elaborate on our 
protection scheme would defeat its purpose.  
<P>
In the intial stages of developing the system, we had more than our 
fair share of people attempt to 'spam' the surveys - it helped us 
protect against such tactics.  In a few cases where users were 
successful, we were able to identify them in cooperation with their 
ISP and take appropriate action.  There is one person out of a job 
and one person expelled from a major university as a result of such 
subversive activities - and even now, they could not repeat their 
performance as a result of our new protection.  Those that were 
caught that did not have diciplinary action taken against them have 
had their entire system banned from the survey system - yes we do 
have an automated blacklist (it's very small though).  This isn't to 
say that it's impossible to defeat our protection against people 
posting multiple answers, but if you do it, we will catch you and 
you'll be sorry.  In the computer world, ultimately there is no 
fool-proof security - just like in every other segment of society, 
people should be left to their own devices to act appropriate and 
not destroy the work of others.  With that being said, at any time 
we can produce log files identifying the integrity of our surveys.
<P>
However, I stand behind the integrity of the SURVEY.NET data and
can produce log files which clearly demonstrate that the information
comes from unique respondents all over the net.

<H3><A NAME="1.4.0">
Are the Surveys anonymous?
</A></H3><H4>

YES, YES they are.  The system in its present configuration does not 
keep track of any individual survey answers - never at any time are 
user responses even written to disk - they are instantly compiled 
with the main data file.  There is no way we can specifically 
identify what answers any specific user has provided to any specific 
question - period!
<P>
The survey system does log activity however, but it is limited in 
its scope of what we can identify.  The Internet is by its very 
nature somewhat anonymous - anyone using a browser can fake an 
e-mail address - so it's very difficult to identify users 
specifically.  We have always had the option of authenticating users 
and requiring valid information in order to access the site, but we 
are not implementing this option - for the most part, 99.99999% of 
our visitors are honorable and honest in answering questions and 
following the rules - our logs prove this.  We don't want to make it 
a hassel of getting to the site by specifying a username and 
password - this hasn't become an issue and we hope it never will.

<H3><A NAME="1.5.0">
What language is the Survey system written in?  What system can run 
it?
</A></H3><H4>

The Survey engine is written in Ansi C and has been tested in a 
variety of environments - it can probably run on just about any 
computer that is capable of connecting to the web with a standard 
Ansi C-compiler available.  The source code is about 7,000 lines and 
growing as we add more features.  We have executable code for Novell 
Unixware, BSD, Sun, and other platforms. 

<H3><A NAME="1.5.1">
Is the Survey engine available to others?
</A></H3><H4>

At the present time there are no plans to make this software publicly available.
The main reason for this is that having too many copies of the Survey Engine
on the net would dilute the value of our site, and if other people were running
more-biased survey systems, it might reflect badly upon SURVEY.NET's reputation
as being objective.  This is not to say that there are no other versions of
SURVEY.NET available online.  We're currently working on setting up a European
version called "InterPoll" which will be run in the United Kingdom, and of course,
being a starving artist, if the money is right, we may consider licensing use
of the system.  <A HREF="mailto:wisdom@icorp.net">Email</A> me if you are
seriously interested in utilizing the technology - we might be able to work
something out.


<H3><A NAME="1.6.0">
How are new surveys designed?  Who decides or creates a new survey?
</A></H3><H4>

I pretty-much decide what goes up on the site.  I rely heavily on 
user-input to decide what surveys should be added or how surveys 
should be modified.  I try not to modify a survey after it's been 
released - at the most I'll correct spelling errors (which I'm 
slowly becoming famous for (grin)).
<P>
The decision to add a new survey is not solely my own - I may have 
an idea for a topic that I feel may be investigated, but at that 
point I use the full advantage of the net to seek out other, 
more-experienced people to help me create a survey.  Our current 
religion survey is a good example.  Regardless of my personal 
religious philosophy, there was no way I or any single individual 
could come up with an appropriate questionnaire on this topic that 
would not alienate particular groups - I contact the an agency, the 
Ontario Centre for Religious Tolerance and asked for their guidance 
in helping me develop an appropriate survey.  Quite often, the 
intial survey is run for a short period of time; I get feedback, 
revise the survey and start a new one with enhanced questions.

<H3><A NAME="1.7.0">
If I have an idea for a survey, what should I do?
</A></H3><H4>

Send me <A HREF="mailto:wisdom@icorp.net">e-mail</A>.  
Most of what's online is the result of user 
feedback so please feel free to offer your suggestions for new 
surveys or enhancements to existing surveys.
<P>
The more organized your response is, the more-likely it will become 
a reality.  If you present a well-thought-out list of questions & 
answers, there may be a good chance it could be the basis for a 
future survey.  BUT, please be advised that we primarily publish
surveys of a general nature - if you're looking for something
specific, there's not a great chance that we will run a survey.

<H3><A NAME="1.8.0">
What if I wanted you to run a specific survey?  Will you do that for 
organizations?
</A></H3><H4>

Yes.  It depends upon the nature of the survey however, as to 
whether or not it would be included in the main SURVEY.NET system.  
There is a standard which the main system adheres to.  Being a 
starving artist, I'll gladly produce surveys for commercial 
entities, especially if I can help subsidize my activities, but if 
it is something in conflict with our principals of objectivity, I 
may ask that the survey be isolated and promoted independetly.  
Along this line, I'll also entertain offers to license the Survey 
Engine for use on other systems by other organizations - this use 
will be limited in most cases - either for private, non-competitive 
use, or in accordance with the Survey Net standard of being as 
un-biased as possible.  
<P>
Recently, I was contacted by the folks at MegaMall who wanted to 
accumulate some demographics & opinions on online shopping - 
obviously this is something of great value so we worked together to 
create an appropriate survey.  Everyone is now able to exploit the 
information generated.  I'm particularly interested in major sites 
sponsoring surveys - especially if they direct traffic to SURVEY.NET 
- the more people the merrier!

<H3><A NAME="1.9.0">
If my company wanted to license your software or have something 
customized done, is it possible?
</A></H3><H4>

Yes.  You'll have to contact me, but I'm open to a variety of ideas 
on this.  Send e-mail to wisdom@icorp.net or wisdom@enterprise.net.  
I develop net-based client-server applications
in my business, and if you like SURVEY.NET, then you have an idea of
the quality of my work.  I also have a number of other advanced systems
which have been created after SURVEY.NET, including "The Engine", an
automated shopping mall system, and WebSet - a program that can be
used to create web pages using "templates" from a browser.  WebSet is
currently being implemented in SURVEY.NET to allow authorized columnists
to automatically update sections of the SURVEY.NET site - in this manner
the authorized writers can update their own pages without any intervention.

<H3><A NAME="1.10.0">
Can the survey results be republished?  Are there any restrictions?
</A></H3><H4>

All information generated by SURVEY.NET is republishable in any 
form.  We ask that you give us credit in your reference in return - 
that's all.  If possible, list our WWW URL of 
"http://www.survey.net/index.html, or credit "source: Mike Perry/SURVEY.NET".  
Other than that, feel free to re-print the information.  Please 
endeavor to reprint the information in it's entirety however - we do 
not want the data to be extrapolated and used out of context.  It's 
ok to extrapolate responses to individual questions, but do not 
endeavor to mis-represent the data accumulated.  We reserve the 
right to restict any organization's ability to republish data from 
our site if it is distorted in its presentation.  We ask that any 
republished information be sent to use (primarily for my own 
amusement) to:
  PCS, PO Box 7638, Metairie, LA 70010
<P>
More information can be found on the 
<A HREF="http://www.survey.net/license.htm">License Page</A>.

<H3><A NAME="1.11.0">
I've noticed some disparity between the number of respondents and 
total survey answers to specific questions, what gives?
</A></H3><H4>

This disparity seems to be the result of certain types of browsers 
not completely sending all forms data to the script - it's beyond 
our capability to deal with.  We try to keep the number of survey 
questions limited so that those who are running 'buggy' browsers 
don't make the numbers not properly add-up.  This doesn't affect the 
accuracy of survey data - however there may be some cases where some 
users' answers to specific questions are simply not recorded.   It's 
very difficult to track down the cause of this problem - it is 
noticable when you get into the area of having a thousand or more 
surveys completed - so it's not very common.  Different browsers 
handle forms data in different manners - some browsers will NOT send 
a survey answer if the user didn't specifically pick the response 
(and instead left the default answer as it was).  If you're 
analyzing survey data, assume any disparity in the number of answers 
to a specific question to be defined as "No answer."
<P>
In some RARE cases, the disparity may be due to the survey being 
modified after it was released and the results not cleared.  If I 
run across a survey where I feel an additional question should be 
added, I may add the question/answers to the survey - I've only done 
this once and will not do it often.  And in such a case, the rule 
above applies.  If 75 people answered a survey and I decide to add a 
new question, you may notice that one question has 75 less responses 
than all the others - just consider those 75 to be null or "no 
answer" since the question wasn't there before.  This will very 
rarely occur.  I'm more apt to reset an entire survey if I make any 
major changes.
<P>

The END  (for now)
