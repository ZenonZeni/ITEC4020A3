<h1>Safe Use of Cannabis </h1>

<p> <b>by Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D. </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Cannabis, ingested safely, is one of the most useful of
medicines for a variety of conditions. These include: pain,
spasticity, anxiety, depression, headache, nausea, anorexia,
epilepsy, asthma, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual tension, withdrawal
from other drugs, and glaucoma. </p>

<p> Ignorantly or imprudently used, cannabis can be harmful. </p>

<h2>Physical effects. </h2>

<p> Irritation of the throat and lungs is one of the most obvious
adverse effects to the marijuana smoker as is the inevitable
cough upon inhaling. </p>

<p> The cough is the body's reaction to the irritation of the
numerous constituents of the smoke. Prolonged and repeated
exposure to these irritants can lower resistance to and aggravate
infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungi. </p>

<p> The lesser the coughing, the safer the smoke. The fewer puffs
the better. </p>

<p> For these reasons, and to reduce harm to the user; better a
water pipe of the more potent flower tops of cannabis than a
joint of leaves. </p>

<h2>Even better: Vaporization. </h2>

<p> Delta 1,9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), psychoactive ingredient
of cannabis, is a resin that vaporizes at 155 to 157 degrees
centigrade (311-318 degrees Fahrenheit) which is lower than the
combustion point of cellulose: Fahrenheit 451. Any way to
decrease exposure of the throat and lungs to products of burning
reduces harm to the cannabis user. </p>

<h2>Dosage and Route of Administration </h2>

<p> Starting with a small amount and gradually increasing the
dose is the key to avoiding unwanted mental side effects. This is
called titration- self-titration if adjusted by the user. </p>

<h2>Mental Effects </h2>

<p> Impatience and overdosing with oral cannabis is the most
frequent mention of the drug in medical literature of the 1800's.
Oral cannabis overdoseage is much more intense and longer lasting
than from the inhaled route. Because of the two to three hours
before onset of effects, a common mistake of the inexperienced is
to repeat the oral dose with the consequence of overdosing. </p>

<h2>Overdoseage </h2>

<p> Should you take too much cannabis you may expect the mental
effects of time distortion, racing thoughts, disorientation,
speeding heart rate, dry mouth, and reddened eyes. The greater
the dose, the greater intensity and longer these stimulant
effects will last before sinking into a deep sleep. No lasting
harm will result but the experience will not be forgotten. </p>

<h2>Other Adverse Effects </h2>

<p> Other adverse mental effects are a prolonged dullness after
use or paranoia and a fear of loss of control. Cannabis, an
effective relaxant, can cause an alienation or detachment. The
price of relief of tension may be a dulling or suppression of
feelings. Insensitivity to feelings of others or situations may
result. </p>

<h2>Set and Setting </h2>

<p> The result of the drug is a combination of set
(expectations), setting, personality, and the drug. </p>

<p> Best case: Enjoying a puff or two sitting at home with a
friend at the end of the day. </p>

<p> Worst case: Taking a puff driving down the freeway, then
looking sideways into the eyes of a cop. </p>

<h2>Personality and Individual Difference </h2>

<p> Individuals with personalities that are prone to substance
abuse, allergy, sensitivity, or adverse reactions to other
medicines should exert greater caution and try the drug only if
absolutely necessary. </p>

<h2>Dependence &amp; Withdrawal </h2>

<p> Because cannabis is such an effective medicine for the relief
of many uncomfortable conditions, using the drug on a continuing
basis is not uncommon. One must decide issues of personal
risks/benefits of continuing using cannabis. </p>

<p> Withdrawal from chronic cannabis use produces several nights
of more intense dreaming and possibly some slightly increased
nervousness during the day. Some increase in exercise, if
possible, and/or small amounts of other sedatives will ease the
transition from cannabis dependence. </p>

<h2>Cannabis- a Tool </h2>

<p> Cannabis is a tool like other drugs; useful for many people
if informed of its effects. with realistic expectations,
responsibility and common sense. There is a range of appropriate
use: from total avoidance to using cannabis several times a day. </p>

<p> Because of current uncertainty of supply from it's illicit
status there can be great variability in strength. </p>
