In the District of Columbia, the average child in the delinquency system has 
fallen a minimum of two school years behind his peer group in terms of actual 
school placement, and is a minimum of three to four years behind in terms of 
academic achievement. The majority of children entering the juvenile 
delinquency system in D.C. have learning disabilities, emotional disturbances 
or mental retardation. Unfortunately, the professionals who deal with these 
children, namely, judges, probation offices, juvenile prosecutors and defense 
attorneys, typically lack the training to recognize these problems, and are 
unfamiliar with special education law. 

<p>Joseph Tulman, Associate Professor of Law and Director of the Juvenile Law 
Clinic at the District of Columbia School of Law, contends that lawyers who 
can discern learning disabilities in their clients can enhance the 
effectiveness of their representation in many ways, in his article, The Best 
Defense is a Good Offense: Incorporating Special Education Law into 
Delinquency Representation in the Juvenile Law Clinic. "Children with
learning disabilities, emotional disturbances and mental retardation do
not always understand their legal rights completely; lawyers can try
different methods of communicating with their clients, or have a guardian ad 
litem look out for the child s best interests. An understanding of special
education law can help an attorney hone her approach to the case." 

<p>A child with a learning disability may qualify for a dismissal of a 
delinquency matter and referral to the mental retardation system, if the child
is found to be moderately mentally retarded. Recognizing a juvenile client’s
mental or emotional disabilities can enable an attorney to argue for dismissal
based on "social reasons" under District of Columbia Superior Court Juvenile
Rule 48(b). Because prosecutors must not only prove that the child has
committed the alleged offense, but also that the child is "in need  of
care and rehabilitation", defense attorneys can pre-empt prosecution by
showing that the child has received treatment outside of the court, and 
therefore is not in need of additional care and rehabilitation. 

<p>In deciding whether to pursue special education rights, an attorney must, 
consistent with professional ethics, follow the client’s wishes. Often, a
client has dropped out of school and perhaps because of past academic failure
and frustration, is reluctant to return. While an attorney should listen 
empathetically, and counsel the client in light of his own perceptions of 
self-interest, an attorney should also follow the client’s wishes if he does n
ot wish to have a psycho-educational evaluation. Parents should also be 
consulted during this stage, since many education rights inure to the parent. 
While there is no inherent conflict in representing both the child and parent, 
an attorney should advise the parent of potential conflicts and what limits 
exist should a conflict arise. If the child agrees to pursue a 
psycho-educational evaluation, special education law requires the government
to place a juvenile in an appropriate educational setting within fifty days of 
a request for educational e valuation. Since delinquency matters in D.C. take 
at least sixty days from arrest/initial hearing to first scheduled trial date, 
under ideal conditions, a dismissal for social reasons could be made before 
the first trial date. 

<p>Special education law can also be used to improve the placement of the 
child. Federal and local laws require the government to provide each child 
with a "free appropriate public education" (FAPE), which does not mean an 
optimal learning environment. However, family court utilizes the "best
interest of the child" standard for dispositional orders. Thus an attorney
who receives an unsatisfactory result through the special education system can 
resort to family court Since special education law also requires the
"least restrictive environment", while family court has an obligation to
protect the community, an attorney may also be able to argue for placement in 
the least restrictive environment. 

<p>The legal community’s understanding of learning disabilities and special 
education law can be enhanced through juvenile law clinics within law schools. 
Law clinics can serve a dual function of educating the students at hand, and 
reaching out to the larger legal community. Using special education law in a 
juvenile clinic requires law students to actively develop alternative 
placements and strategies in the special education system, rather than rely 
exclusively on defense strategies. Juvenile law clinics can reach out to the 
larger legal community by offering training sessions in the law of special 
education for lawyers representing juveniles. These training sessions can 
include the distribution of useful materials, such as sample pleadings. Law 
clinics can also help establish a network of private special education experts 
who will accept referrals of cases from attorneys. These services will help 
raise the standard of practice within the community.

<p>The foregoing was summarized from an article entitled, <b>"The Best
Defense is a Good Offense: Incorporating Special Education Law Into
Delinquency Representation in the Juvenile Law Clinic"</b> by Joseph
Tulman. This article first appeared in 42 Journal of Urban and Contemporary 
Law 223 (1992).
