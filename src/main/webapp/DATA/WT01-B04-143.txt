<H3><CENTER>Use of marijuana and other illicit drugs may play role in increase
of genital abnormalities and infertility in males </CENTER>
</H3>
A report by Auger et al., New England Journal of Medicine. 332:281 -285,
1995, shows that in some countries, during the past 20 years, there was
a decline in the quality of sperm of fertile men which correlated with an
increase in genital abnormalities such as cancer and cryptorchidism. This
effect was independent of the age of the men. In the same issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine, Howards, page 312, pointed out that male infertility
is often related to lifestyle factors such as the use of marijuana, anabolic
steroids, and cocaine. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> While associations such as these do not prove
cause and effect, it is of interest that illicit drug use could be a major
factor in the decline of fertility among men over the past two decades.
The authors of the original paper admit to not having another explanation
and acknowledge that environmental or lifestyle factors could be playing
a major role. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>Lower IQ in Toddlers Linked to Prenatal Exposure to Marijuana.
</CENTER>
</H3>
Researchers (Day et al. Neurotoxicology and Teratology 16, 169-175, 1994),
found ''significant negative effects of prenatal marijuana exposure on the
performance&quot; of both African-American and Caucasian children in standard
intelligence tests. This negative effect on the child was related to marijuana
exposure during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. On average,
children exposed prenatally to marijuana will have a lower IQ compared to
children who are not exposed, even when the effects of various environmental
factors are adjusted for. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> The children involved in this study were tracked
from birth to three years. The study, which included an equal number of
Caucasian and African-American women, most of whom were single and of lower
socioeconomic status, suggesting that marijuana, not race or other prenatal
factors, accounts for these changes. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>Sleeping Problems Found in Toddlers Exposed to Marijuana </CENTER>
</H3>
Prenatal exposure to marijuana showed impairment in sleep pattern and more
awake time after sleep onset in exposed children, at age three, compared
to control children (Dahl and colleagues in the journal, Archives of Pediatric
and Adolescent Medicine, 149:145-150, 1995). Sleep deprivation is frequently
associated with emotional and behavioral difficulties and reduced attention
span, symptoms which could be associated with other psychiatric problems
as well. Marijuana directly impacts the part of the brain that regulates
sleep and arousal, causing concern that prenatal use of marijuana could
affect the development of that part of the brain, resulting in permanent
changes in sleeping patterns. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary: </STRONG>While studies of prenatal marijuana exposure
and long-term follow-up of children so exposed are rare, the weight of the
evidence suggests that this exposure is not without adverse consequences
for the child. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>Substance use during Vietnam conflict associated with nine times
higher mortality rate than that for civilians </CENTER>
</H3>
Price et al., from Washington University School of Medicine, presented long
term follow-up studies on a group of Vietnam veterans, now in their mid-40's,
compared to civilian controls who did not serve in Vietnam. Veterans who
tested positive for drugs upon their return from Southeast Asia, had a nine
times higher death rate than that of the civilian controls. The death rate
for veterans who tested negative for drugs was still four times higher.
The authors concluded that substance use in the Vietnam experience played
a key role in the increased mortality. <BR>
<BR>
This is a culmination of a landmark study started in 1972 and consists of
900 soldiers who had come home from Vietnam the year before. All had been
tested for drug use. Three year follow-up interviews were conducted in 1974
when civilian controls were also added to the sample. The current study
tracks the original participants. <BR>
<BR>
Available data in the present study show that a sizeable percentage of deceased
veterans who tested positive for drugs died of drug and/or alcohol related
causes according lo death certificates. Of the deceased drug positive veterans
37 percent had alcohol or drug related causes of death, and 14 percent were
found to be homicide victims. <BR>
<BR>
While these men tested positive in one single drug test, the authors noted
that it was interesting that this one test seemed to have predicted both
the high mortality and a high risk of certain causes of death. The authors
noted that drug use was not the only statistically significant predictor
of premature death, since veterans who tested negative for drugs still had
a four times higher death rate than men of similar age and background who
did not go to Vietnam. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This important study should carry major alarm
messages for those who advocate casual drug use and minimalize the impact
on the medical and psychiatric health of the population. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>Toxic Psychosis Produced by Marijuana Smoking While on Antabuse
</CENTER>
</H3>
A 36-year-old man who was on Antabuse alcohol treatment smoked marijuana
as a substitute for alcohol. He immediately developed an acute toxic psychosis
with disorientation, lack of reality, and a manic psychosis. This lasted
for 48 hours. The manufacturers of Antabuse have had one previous report
of this type of drug interaction (Lacoursiere et al., American Journal of
Psychiatry, 140:242-244, 1983.) <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> People attesting to a relative safety of marijuana
forget that there are interactions between many drugs that may lead to adverse
reactions. This example of an acute toxic psychosis in someone under treatment
for alcohol abuse emphasizes the potential for marijuana interactions with
prescription and non-prescription substances. <BR>
