TELECOM BILL LINGERS AS LAWMAKERS BREAK FOR HOLIDAYS

     Congress adjourned Dec. 22 for Christmas holiday without
filing conference committee report on telecom reform legislation. 
Although Senate Republicans late in day started process of
collecting signatures of conferees, there was no such action with
Senate Democrats or in House, as Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) didn't
release report for examination and signatures.

     By afternoon of Dec. 22, Senate Republicans and Democrats said
final arrangements had been worked out.  House Democrats were
satisfied with language, pending final examination.  But House
Republicans were split, with at least 3 elements in play.  One was
Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), who urged members to sign
conference report.  One was Telecom Subcommittee Chmn. Fields
(R-Tex.), who from his Houston home called lawmakers to urge them
not to sign conference report.  He had left Washington Dec. 21 to
be with his wife, who is in final stage of pregnancy.  At
leadership meeting morning of Dec. 21, Fields listed his objections
to bill following Bliley's status report, and differences
continued.  Rep. Hastert (R-Ill.), member of leadership and of
Commerce Committee, said members "will have to make up their own
minds" about which side to take.  Industry sources said Fields
reluctantly had decided to sign conference report.  Sources also
said Judiciary Committee Chmn. Hyde (R-Ill.) was asking members not
to sign report.

     Third and final factor is House leadership, Rep. Stearns
(R-Fla.) pointed out.  Despite differences between Fields and
Bliley, no bill will be closed out without leadership approving it,
Stearns said.  At time House adjourned Dec. 22, several Republicans
told us that they still had problems with bill.  As Rep. White
(R-Wash.) said on leaving House chamber:  "We're still working on
it."  Included on list were familiar issues of foreign ownership
and broadcast ownership.  But Reps. Oxley (R-O.) and Goodlatte
(R-Va.) mentioned Internet regulation as point that should be
revisited.  They told us in interviews that there was no reason
that language preventing FCC from regulating content or prices on
Internet should be removed, noting that House had passed it by
large margin.

     Final language agreed to, according to Senate staff, was
little changed from night before, when Commerce Committee Chmn.
Pressler (R-S.D.) said "framework" existed.  Negotiations resulted
in removal of language covering one-year delay in RHC joint
marketing of local and long distance services.  Other than that,
FCC freeze on attribution rules still was out, as were provisions
preventing Commission from regulating Internet, references to
foreign ownership and language to preempt states on price
regulation.  Broadcast ownership language also remained unchanged,
with 35% national audience cap still in place, although FCC could
use its residual waiver authority.  New phrase was added to clarify
Justice Department's role in determining whether RHCs should enter
long distance, saying FCC should give DoJ's opinion "substantial
weight," but "such evaluation shall not have any preclusive effect
on any Commission decision..."

     Despite uncertainty on House side, Sen. Hollings (D-S.C.),
senior Commerce Committee Democrat, said:  "There's no question in
my mind that there's agreement.  It's a good bill and it's agreed
upon.  I think ultimately you've got some political atmospheres
poisoned when the Vice President says he's for it and they [House
Republicans] say, 'We're against it.'  Maybe we can get the Vice
President to announce he opposes it."  Meanwhile, Bradley Stillman,
legislative dir. for Consumer Federation of America, wanted to
correct impression from Oxley, who had said that if CFA supported
bill, it would be victory for regulators.  CFA doesn't support
bill, Stillman said.

     On Dec. 21, House had offered new broadcast diversity
language, which brought immediate response from one network
affiliates group -- letters to President Clinton and Senate
Commerce Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) protesting proposals as
anticompetitive.

     House broadcast proposal would keep in place 35% national cap
on audience share that could be owned by one owner, but at same
time would give FCC ability to grant waiver to lift cap on
case-by-case basis if action wouldn't harm diversity or
competition.  Factors that Commission could consider in making
decision include:  (1) Effect of acquisition on concentration at
national level.  (2) "Actual aggregate" national audience reach in
which one person or company would own or have "cognizable
interest."  (3) Effect on diversity in local market.  (4) Effect on
public interest, convenience, necessity.  Language on "actual
aggregate" audience is one of 2 parts of proposal put in for Fox,
which argues that it should have higher than 35% ownership because
its ratings aren't as high as networks.  Other Fox-backed provision
would prohibit FCC from establishing or modifying any policy or
rule on attribution or calculation of media ownership.  Broadcast
industry source said provision was inconsistent with rest of bill
because it would bar Commission from acting while other parts of
bill would direct FCC to take action.

     Other elements of bill would allow one owner to have 2 VHF
stations in single market with Commission approval under
"extraordinary and compelling circumstances," while setting
standards for diversity that would call for 10 separately owned
stations in top 25 markets, 6 stations in next 75 and 3 in all
other markets.  Consumer representatives criticized bill as
insufficient in protecting public interest.

                      *    *    *    *    *

     Wireless Cable Assn.'s contention that loophole in bill, which
it blamed on Rep. Schaefer (R-Colo.), could hurt that industry (CM
Dec 18 p6) is inaccurate, Schaefer's office said, saying language
on uniform pricing as applied to buildings was Senate offer, not
Schaefer's.  In any case, staffer said, proposal would put burden
on competitor to make case to FCC in complaint, but if Commission
then accepts case, cable operator would have to prove that there's
no predatory pricing by disclosing its costs of service.  In
addition, current proposals deregulate SMATV operators by leaving
them out of definition of cable operator if system doesn't cross
public rights-of-way.  Provisions weren't drawn up with Liberty
Cable situation in mind, Schaefer staffer said.  Liberty has
protested that language could hurt it in competitive battle with
Time Warner.

JUSTICE DEPT., BROADCASTERS OPPOSE QUICK MUST-CARRY DECISION; 
CABLE DISAGREES

     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule for
must-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have been
decided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,
Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid for
quick action.  Brief signed by Solicitor Gen. Drew Days also said
expedited schedule would be hardship for govt. because of federal
shutdown and holidays.

     But cable interests don't seek shortened briefing schedule,
merely quick decision to take case that would allow it to be heard
this term, cable groups said in reply brief.  NCTA and programmers
repeated that they're willing to shorten their own briefing time if
necessary to get decision this term.  Size of record doesn't make
quick decision impossible, they said, because dispute isn't over
facts, only over legal significance of facts.  Brief also said
majority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at all
because one judge backed full hearing on merits.

     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in this
case," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,
"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by Supreme
Court in earlier decision (CM July 4/94 p1).  Now, Court must
evaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidence submitted to lower
court to determine whether Congress had enough evidence to back its
decision to impose must-carry.

     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, said joint
brief by NAB, INTV, APTS, PBS, CPB.  However, they said it took 5
months for lower court to consider evidence and uphold
congressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would be
required before this Court could reverse that judgment and strike
down a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how much
this appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Court
to decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."

     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)
Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staff
employees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply with
expedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows that
must-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth in
channel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry on
channel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers have
more, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry began,
so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cable argument
that quick decision is needed because next date for selecting
between must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct., said any
burden of that deadline is on broadcasters, who are willing to
accept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision on must-carry
for advanced TV doesn't require quick decision because no advanced
TV will enter service before Court's next term.

     Cable had hoped to know by end of last week whether Supreme
Court will expedite appeal of must-carry.  NCTA, Turner Bcstg.,
Time Warner, Discovery and Atlanta Interfaith Bcstrs. had filed
appeal of U.S. Dist. Court decision and request for expedited
treatment on Dec. 21.

     Dist. Court used wrong definition of broadcasting in its
narrow decision upholding must-carry, original cable brief said. 
Lower court said must-carry is needed to protect individual
broadcasters, rather than broadcasting industry as whole, according
to brief, and industry as whole is healthy:  "The government
effectively concedes that the broadcasting system as a whole is not
in economic jeopardy."  Individual stations that might not be
carried without must-carry usually are little watched and in
communities with unusually high number of stations, cable said.

     Must-carry is too restrictive in protecting broadcasting,
cable said.  If goal is to prevent cable's anticompetitive
behavior, there are less restrictive ways than imposing must-carry
on every cable operator, original brief said.  Other cable
arguments:  (1) Must-carry limits speech of cable programmers
because of channel capacity limits.  (2) Many benefits could be
realized through A/B switches and leased access channels.  (3) Cost
of must-carry on freedom of speech is too high.  (4) "Substantial
First Amendment challenge" shouldn't be decided because one judge
was reluctant to require full trial.

FCC PLANS TO HOMOGENIZE CABLE AND TELCO WIRING REGULATION

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home
wiring rules between telcos and cable, saying change is needed
because of convergence of industries.  Rulemaking will deal with
demarcation between customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal
leakage and quality, technical standards, customer-premises
equipment (CPE), division of state and federal responsibilities. 
In separate decision, FCC significantly eased limits on amount of
cable costs that can be included in cost-of-service rate
proceedings.

     Regulation of cable and telcos should be comparable "where
appropriate," FCC Comr. Ness said, and Commission should deregulate
"where it makes sense."  Comr. Chong said rulemaking launched Dec.
15 is significant improvement over previous drafts, which she said
didn't recognize impact of convergence of industries.  She said she
would have preferred to move demarcation point immediately, but
went along with rulemaking "since we have agreed to move swiftly." 
Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendous competitive
advantage" for incumbent, and new rules could make cable CPE market
as competitive as telephone equipment market.  Comr. Quello
expressed concern about burden of new rules on incumbents and said
benefits are "difficult to quantify."

     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point would
be appropriate, acknowledging it might be different for
single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'
broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage and
signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should have
to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcos
have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatory
distinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring as
telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-home
broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divide
regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,
states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation of
telephony and video programming.

     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should have
same rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customers
have.  It also said it believes that it may be appropriate to
deregulate cable equipment rates after market becomes competitive
and after transition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whether
Commission has authority to deregulate equipment rates.

     As result of wiring rulemaking, FCC rejected petitions for
reconsideration filed by Nynex and others asking that demarcation
point between customer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multiple
dwelling units be moved.  Chong said demarcation point, currently
12" outside subscriber premises, often isn't accessible to rivals,
so it reduces likelihood of competition.  Commission did set
rulemaking to determine whether persons other than individual
subscribers should be able to buy wiring in some circumstances.

     In response to separate petition, Commission also amended
rules on wiring procedures when customer terminates service.  New
rules shorten period operator has to remove wiring to 7 days from
30, set specific procedures for notifying ex-customer and amount
customer should pay for wiring, and say customer automatically owns
it if operator doesn't comply.

     New cost-of-service (COS) rules sharply increase amount of
intangible assets that cable operators can include in cost base to
justify rate of return.  Operators now can include only such
intangible assets as organizational costs, franchise costs,
customer lists.  Impact of action was somewhat limited, however,
because of volume of negotiated rate settlements that FCC has
approved, which limits MSOs' COS filings.  Commissioners said eased
rules are justified by agency's increasing knowledge of
complexities of cable industry.  "With age comes wisdom," Quello
said.  Ness said first rules were set "in an incredibly tight time
frame" and FCC now can tailor them better to specific needs of
cable industry.  Fact that Congress appears likely to retain cable
rate regulation "has to be read as a testament to" Cable Bureau's
successful implementation, Hundt said.

     Commission's earlier rules had said that cable operators could
include in cost base virtually none of cost of buying systems
beyond that of tangible assets.  That decision was based on
assumption that system sales prices were inflated based on
expectation of monopoly profits.  New COS rules assume that 66% of
purchase price of systems bought before May 15, 1994, can be
included in base.  New rules also allow operators to include
virtually all of their startup losses in cost base, rather than
just those accumulated in first 2 years.

     FCC will continue to assume current 11.25% rate of return is
appropriate, but started rulemaking to determine whether operators
should be allowed to try to justify higher return based on debt
cost and capital structure.  In other decisions, Commission
declared that:  (1) Systems can include cost of unused channels in
cost base as long as they will be used for regulated service within
12 months.  (2) Assets must be depreciated over useful life, not
over remaining term of franchise, because of presumption that
franchise will be renewed.  (3) Operators can put nonregulated
costs into single "all other" category instead of several.

SOME CABLE LEGAL WORK SLOWING AS REGULATION PASSES PEAK

     End of first round of cable rate cases and industry
consolidation is causing some dislocations among cable attorneys,
but most big law firms we surveyed said work merely was shifting
and some were busier than ever.  Big mergers and cable system sales
are definitely affecting some lawyers.  "There has been a big
consolidation within the industry, which means fewer entities to
represent," said Richard Wiley of Wiley, Rein & Fielding.  "The
impact is significant."  Most top lawyers predicted that telecom
reform legislation would mean even bigger wave of work.

     Despite rumors that some top cable firms were laying off
associates, none we talked with said they were cutting staff, and
most said they were adding personnel.  Cole, Raywid & Braverman,
which devotes 80-90% of its time to cable and has been subject of
rumors since releasing several associates, has added more staff
members than have departed, John Cole said:  "We've been relatively
busy and we've been hiring.  We've been very busy on franchise
renewals and things like that, and the rate work continues."

     Regardless, raft of cable rulemakings, rate cases, must-carry
and program access complaints and other Cable Act-related issues
that caused cable law boom starting in 1993 has tapered off.  As
FCC rationalizes rate rules and moves toward annual, instead of
quarterly, cable rate-setting, and cases become more routine,
there's less legal work to be done.  There has been trend toward
moving such routine cable legal work to in-house lawyers from
outside law firms, several attorneys said, and they indicated that
they have been encouraging trend because of its heavy reliance on
number-crunchers rather than legal expertise.  However, one lawyer
said reliance on in-house counsel doesn't always result in net loss
of legal business because corporate lawyers often seek backup of
outside law firms.

     Some new legal staffers have different skills because of
changing environment.  Frank Lloyd of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,
Glovsky & Popeo, said his firm's last 5-6 hires have been lawyers
with common carrier backgrounds.  "The nature of cable legal work
is different," he said.  "A huge proportion of the FCC work is
moving to the Common Carrier Bureau because so many of our clients
want to move into telephony."  Lloyd said cable clients also are
becoming involved in such typical common carrier cases as universal
service, interoperability, number portability, access.  "Hopefully,
most cable lawyers have already been trying to learn [common
carrier] for a few years," he said.  "We started with VDT and built
on that."

     First wave of cable rate cases has crested, said Seth Davidson
of Fleischman & Walsh, but that's just normal "ebb and flow" of
cable law.  He said cable lawyers remain busy with other issues,
including recent cable wiring and rate rulemakings issued by FCC: 
"We've been busy as all get-out.  I am just swamped."  Lloyd said
rate cases are "a very narrow subset" of cable law, and many
lawyers are happy to have fewer of such cases, which have become
relatively routine:  "I like to deal with the bigger issues of
getting my clients into new businesses."

     Most other cable regulatory issues, notably must-carry and
related points, still remain "very active," Lloyd said.  Wiley said
his firm remains busy with programmer issues, and that's likely to
get even more active as channel capacity crunch eases.

     Consolidation of industry has affected some lawyers.  John
Davis of Wiley, Rein, for example, decided to retire at least
temporarily when clients such as Providence Journal and Sammons
chose to leave cable business.  Davis, who also cited other reasons
for retiring, said result is "same number of lawyers chasing fewer
clients."

     Municipal attorneys report similar industry and regulatory
changes that have forced some repositioning.  Washington lawyer
Patrick Grant of Arnold & Porter said workload hasn't decreased,
but most rate-setting work is over.  He said calculating annual
increases -- now allowed for inflation and external costs -- is far
less complex than initial task of deciphering first and 2nd FCC
rate orders.  One change among cities, Grant said, is that "there's
beginning to develop a bit of a shift from traditional regulation
to a more broad-based focus on [telecom] infrastructure
development," which requires both video and telephony expertise. 
Aside from that, he said, there's still "slew of renewals" that
require legal guidance.

     Eileen Huggard, exec. dir. of National Assn. of
Telecommunications Officers & Advisers (NATOA), said infrastructure
work is "pretty large undertaking" that more cities are studying --
often with help of legal consultants and Washington lawyers.  In
most states, she said, cities still have greater jurisdiction over
video than telephony side of any telecom network, so lawyers with
cable expertise still are in demand.

     Municipal lawyer Joe Van Eaton of Miller, Canfield, Paddock &
Stone said his firm remains busy on cable matters but work directly
related to rate setting has slowed, partly because of perception
created by FCC social contracts and mass rate settlements: 
"Everyone realizes that it doesn't matter [how much cabler charges]
-- the FCC is going to find a way to give it back to the operator." 
He said industry consolidations had spurred work on franchise
transfers.

     Telecom legislation could mean "a boom time for communications
lawyers for a while," Wiley said:  "There will be a tremendous net
gain [in work] for the short term, though I don't know what it
means downstream.  For the short term, the FCC will be very busy
[with rulemakings], and that means lawyers will be very busy." 
Telecom bill "will mean another 3 years of rate regulation," Lloyd
agreed.  Davis said "it will be a whole new world" if legislation
passes:  "Any time there's uncertainty it breeds caution, and that
means work for lawyers.  The government always seems to find a way
to pick up the slack."

DENVER LAWYER FILES CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST TCI'S LATE FEES

     Denver lawyer Steven Zapiler has filed class action suit
against TCI-owned Mile Hi Cable, alleging that company's $5
"administrative fee" for late payments is "capricious,
unreasonable, unconscionable, arbitrary" and has "no rational
relationship to the presumed and/or actual damages to TCI."  At
same time, Louisville lawyer Mark Fischer took out ad in Lexington
Herald-Leader, complete with 800 number, for prospective plaintiffs
in attempt to build class action case against TCI's Telecable on
late fee issue.  Telecable also charges $5.

     Cases are among those resurrecting late fee issue, which has
been relatively dormant in recent years because of scurrying over
1992 Cable Act, as deregulatory focus of federal telecom bill
threatens local control over cable rates.  One municipal attorney
said issue has "arisen time and again over the years" and may see
new life as other regulatory issues subside.  Others said similar
cases may be on horizon in Cal. and elsewhere.

     Denver suit claims that plaintiffs were "financially injured"
by late fee, which is attempt to "blatantly and illegally extract
additional revenue and profits from its subscribers, by
sidestepping federal, state and local laws and regulations."  Among
questions cited by Zapiler were whether TCI:  (1) Made clear or
intended that fees cover liquidated damages and, if so, that it
should be $5.  (2) Made any attempt to determine or estimate actual
losses from late payments and whether they had "reasonable
relationship" to fees.  (3) Had difficulty determining relationship
between fees and damages.  (4) Imposed fees that were "penal in
nature."  However, suit contends that language of late fee
agreement was "created and drafted unilaterally" by operator on
"take-it-or-leave-it basis," leaving subscribers "without
sufficient bargaining power to compel [TCI] to negotiate, bargain
for, and/or obtain terms other than those imposed by [TCI]."

     Fischer said he expects to file similar class action suit
against Telecable in early Jan. after he finishes nailing down "a
couple of loose ends.  He said newspaper ad prompted "a lot of
response" but he hasn't decided which subscribers will become
principal complainants, or whether suit will focus on state or
federal statutes.  He said both are relevant but he won't disclose
specific details until he completes filing.  However, he said state
law is clearer than "murkier" federal statutes -- some involving
1992 Cable Act that, according to Fischer, may contain language
that could help case.

     Late fees weren't addressed directly in 1992 Cable Act, partly
because they're largely matter of state and local law.  Washington
attorney Joe Van Eaton said most states set parameters for late
fees based on administrative costs associated with delayed payment,
including whether operator could have earned interest on money had
it been paid on time.  In most states, he said, "if it exceeds
that, then it's a problem."

FCC VOTES TO PROCEED WITH DBS AUCTION THIS MONTH, SOME PARTIES
RESTRICTED

     FCC voted 5-0 on circulation to auction DBS slots and
frequencies reclaimed from Advanced Communications after company
failed to meet due diligence requirements.  Comrs. Quello and
Barrett voted for item but dissented in part.  Auction is scheduled
for Jan. 18 and MCI has said it intends to open bidding at $175
million.  Advanced attorney Robert Corn-Revere said decision to
proceed with auction was no surprise:  "It was a foregone
conclusion.  The auction was the point of cancelling Advanced's
permit."  Company has appealed decision to revoke its permit, and
oral argument is set for March 19 in U.S. Appeals Court, D.C.

     Rules approved by FCC include restrictions on ability of
existing DBS operators from participating.  "Single spectrum cap"
would limit companies' ability to control more that one
full-continental U.S. slot, meaning that DirecTV, EchoStar and
other DBS permittees are precluded from entering auction unless
they divest other holdings.  Similarly, if TCI-controlled Primestar
wins auction for Advanced's slot at 110 degrees W, TCI-controlled
Tempo would have to divest interest in 119 degrees W slot.

     FCC didn't preclude cable companies from participating in
auction.  International Bureau Chief Scott Harris said rules were
designed to provide balance between various concerns and to foster
competition.  He said certain anticompetitive restrictions that
were in notice of proposed rulemaking were removed as unnecessary
because of limit on number of slots one company can control.  "We
found the right balance with these rules," he said.

     Electronic auctions will consist of sequential multiple rounds
that will award 2 permits, one for 28 channels at 110 degrees W and
another for 24 channels at 148 degrees W.  FCC Wireless Bureau was
given authority to implement and modify DBS auctions procedures. 
Commission said that prior method of redistributing reclaimed DBS
resources (they were made available to other DBS permittees that in
essence formed line) "no longer serves the public interest, and
that the use of competitive bidding would promote the rapid
deployment of DBS service and the efficient use of DBS spectrum
more effectively than any other assignment method."

     Critics of proceeding say best way to promote rapid deployment
of DBS would be to allow Primestar to continue with plans to deploy
2 high-power satellites in 1996.  Those birds are under
construction at Space/Systems Loral plant in Cal.  Winner of
auction has 4 years to construct and launch single satellite or 6
years to construct and launch multiple satellite system.  Critics
also said that winner of auction could delay construction for up to
6 months pending decision of Appeals Court, which could void
auction results.  Industry source said reason FCC proceeded with
auction and didn't wait for court was because "they want to prove
that they can do it [approve auction rules] quickly."  However,
Harris has said that Bureau's decision to cancel Advanced's permit
will withstand judicial scrutiny because company clearly didn't
meet its due diligence requirements.

DAVIC AGREES ON WORLDWIDE INTERACTIVE TV STANDARDS

     Standards for interactive TV and digital set-top boxes were
approved on Dec. 16 by Digital Audio-Visual Council (DAVIC) at
meeting in Berlin.  DAVIC also moved high-speed cable modems to top
priority for next step of process, and even agreed to special
meeting in May to increase likelihood that modem standard will be
set in June.  Approval of DAVIC 1.0 standard is "historic moment"
and moves industry "much closer to a world that is better
connected," said DAVIC council member Robert Luff,
Scientific-Atlanta chief technical officer-broadband.

     DAVIC 1.0 sets worldwide standard for wide range of digital
interactive services, including video, voice and data, as well as
for set-top boxes to be used by cable, telcos, satellites.  Luff
described 1.0 as "core" standard that will be added to, probably as
often as every 6 months, as new technologies develop.  He said core
standards probably won't change for foreseeable future, with later
additions to be compatible with and build upon 1.0:  "This is a
giant step toward interconnectivity.  We will have this as a base
for other applications to build from, and it will create stability
for content developers."

     DAVIC's 205 member companies should receive text of 1.0
standard by 2nd week of Jan., Luff said, and it will be available
on-line soon after.  Standard then will go to ITU for what's likely
to be relatively automatic approval, which Luff said typically
would occur in about 3 months.

     "Phenomenal rise" of Internet and World Wide Web were major
issues at Berlin meeting, Luff said, causing DAVIC board to move
on-line standards to "highest priority" for next 6 months.  Goal is
to have on-line connection standards approved as part of DAVIC 1.1
by June, he said, in part because of fear that if there's no
standard by then, equipment makers will launch their modems anyway,
which Luff said could cause "some chaos."  DAVIC meeting in May
(date and location not set) was added because there wouldn't be
enough meetings before June in N.Y.C. to approve on-line standard
by June.

     DAVIC group is working closely with CableLabs, Luff said. 
Cablelabs is developing cable modem standard, and he expressed
confidence that any differences between standards would be
minimized.  He said goal is to allow PC users to access cable media
servers, at least to browse if not to receive full movies, and
DAVIC users to be able to access Internet:  "This is a very
important, do-able goal."

     In addition to modem standard, DAVIC hopes 1.1 will include
standards for digital wireless cable.  It also issued call for
standards proposals for return channels for satellite, modulation
schemes for LMDS, application software portability, security
systems.  Later call for proposals includes 3-D animation and
synthetic sound, higher quality video and audio, modulation plans
for terrestrial VHF/UHF, distributed servers, high bandwidth 2-way
audiovisual, content acquisition and production, multimedia mobile
wireless.

     DAVIC 1.0 includes QAM modulation for hybrid fiber/coaxial
systems, as expected (CM June 26 p3), QPSK modulation for
out-of-bandwidth downstream data, upstream data and satellites,
interfaces for set-tops, harmonized General
Instrument/Scientific-Atlanta media access control protocol,
server-to-network protocol.  Immediate consensus wasn't reached on
standards for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, but Luff said
that's expected to be distributed as annex to 1.0.

CAL. PUC ADOPTS FINAL TELECOM COMPETITION RULES, GIVES OKAY TO 31
ENTRANTS

     Cal. PUC on Dec. 20 approved rules to open local telephone
loop Jan. 1 and granted certificates to 31 companies that hope to
become local exchange carriers (LECs).  They include broad
cross-section of telecom industry and at least one electric
utility.  PUC said rules are "largely the same" as proposed
regulations released in July (CM July 31 p8) that set broader
outline for opening markets.  Meanwhile, PUC adopted 3-year freeze
on price caps for Pacific Bell (PB) and GTE, and lowered
productivity factor to rate of inflation because "underlying
assumptions and data" that created current 5% factor are
"obsolete."  Commission also granted some increases for 4 small
telcos.

     Companies that won certificates:  Advantage Communications,
Assoc. Group, AT&T Communications, Brooks Fiber (of Bakersfield,
Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton), Cable Plus, Century
Telecommunications, Continental Telecommunications, Electric
Lightwave, Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE-Cal., GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications, Linkatel Pacific, MCI Metro
Access Transmission Services, MFS Intelenet, NewTelco, Nextlink,
Pacific Bell, Pac-West Telecomm, TCG (of L.A., San Diego, San
Francisco), Viacom Communications, Winstar Wireless.

     New rules set terms for interconnection, interim number
portability (through remote call forwarding) and universal service,
PUC said, and keep "same level of access" for deaf and disabled
residents.  PUC said it will determine cost of remote call
forwarding in separate proceeding early in 1996.  All telecom
providers will have to provide 911 access, directory databases and
"warm-line service," which allows residents to access emergency
services even if phone has been disconnected for other calls. 
Rules contain provisions to protect against slamming by requiring
written confirmation of each sale, with description of services and
price breakdowns.

     One of biggest cable players is Continental, which said its
certificate covers counties of Fresno, Kings, L.A., Madera, Orange,
Riverside, San Joaquin, Sutter, Tulare, Yuba.  Company said it
plans telephony tests in 3rd quarter of 1996, with full deployment
in 1997, and will use AT&T Network Systems' switches, Synchronous
Optical Network (SONET) digital technology.

     PUC also released its report to state legislature on how
competition may affect universal service and proposed that basic
service include 911 access, free customer service, directory
assistance, others.  It also proposed high-cost voucher fund to
subsidize companies in rural areas and said it would lobby
legislature to change existing law to make change possible. 
Voucher system would set credits on customer bills to make sure
they received subsidy regardless of chosen provider, PUC said, and
would base amount of subsidy on cost-rate differential with
incentives to improve efficiency.  It floated idea of competitive
bidding for subsidy and said it would decide issue by June. 
Commission proposed grant programs to hook up libraries and schools
to new telecom services through bill surcharge, taxes on sale of
telecom products, or mandated discounts.  All companies also should
meet same service quality standards, PUC said.

RUMORED BELL ATLANTIC-NYNEX MERGER SEEN AS FIRST OF MANY UNDER A
NEW LAW

     Reported Bell Atlantic (BA)-Nynex merger discussions could be
first of several megamergers triggered by new law, leaving fewer
than half-dozen national providers, financial analysts said. 
Goldman, Sachs, PaineWebber, Smith Barney, UBS Securities and
Prudential Securities said they expect some level of consolidation
in 1996 as companies seek quick access into newly competitive
markets.  BA and Nynex already:  (1) Have merged cellular operation
into Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile.  (2) Have joint $100-million
investment in CAI wireless cable operator.  (3) Own 50% of PCS
Primeco partnership with U S West and AirTouch, which apparently
fueled speculation if not actual discussions, observers said. 
Others said Ameritech could be 3rd merger partner.

     Companies declined comment on report in Wall St. Journal that
they're discussing merger to create nearly $30-billion behemoth --
No. 2 telecom company to AT&T -- to gain entry into long distance. 
"We don't comment on speculation," Nynex spokeswoman James DePeau
said.  "I can neither confirm nor deny" reports, BA spokesman Eric
Rabe said.  Companies had $13 billion each in revenue in 1995 and
project $28 billion combined for 1996.  BA stock has climbed $8 per
share in recent weeks.  However, merger requires passage of telecom
reform bill now in conference in Congress. 

     Industry observers said merger talks would make most sense for
east coast companies, considering traffic volume between BA region,
which includes Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia, and Nynex
region, which covers N.Y. and Boston.  By merging, companies easily
could convert local network to provide long distance services in
corridor without paying access charges now paid by IXCs.  Analysts
estimate 40-60% of U.S. long distance calls originate or terminate
in BA-Nynex region, which would give companies additional clout in
negotiating access agreements with out-of-region LECs.

     Rush to find partners is likely to create no more than 6
behemoths providing full-service offerings, with AT&T and possibly
Sprint cable venture among finishers, with others less certain,
said Michael Elling, senior analyst, Prudential Securities, N.Y. 
Paging companies already are rushing to consolidate operations,
seeking national presence.  "These companies know they have to get
together," Elling told us.  "There can't be 20 large
facilities-based companies competing for business."  He cited
development of cable modems and PCS networks as technologies that
will destabilize local loop competition in 1996.

     Combined company would have revenues close to $28 billion,
given $27.1 billion generated separately in 1994 and $20 billion
total through 3rd quarter 1995.  Companies currently have imbalance
in efficiency, with BA at 30 employees per 10,000 lines, compared
with 37 at Nynex, with both aiming for 20 per 10,000, UBS
Securities said.  Companies cover 13 states from Me. to Va. and
west to W.Va., regions with more than 65 million residents, with
phone penetration exceeding 95% in New England, Pa., Del. and Va. 
Vt. and Va. exceed 98%;  D.C. has least at 92.8%.

CABLE CONSORTIUM COMES UP SHORT AS CANADA ISSUES 2 DBS LICENSES

     Canadian DBS providers ExpressVu and Power DirecTV have
received licenses from Canadian Radio, TV & Telecom Commission
(CRTC) to begin service in June.  CRTC denied license to joint
venture of Shaw Communications and consortium of cable operators
that had applied to launch Homestar service, Canadian equivalent of
Primestar, citing what it called "significant concerns" over
whether Homestar could implement its application.  CRTC also
approved 5 applications for direct-to-home (DTH) ventures.

     Homestar had planned to use Primestar signal when that company
switched to DBS, but now it's uncertain how Primestar will fare in
U.S. DBS auctions by FCC Jan. 24.  As result, it's unclear where
Homestar would get its U.S. programs.  Company said it was
"disappointed," had planned more than 70 video and 35 digital music
services.  Homestar, like Primestar, would have offered rental
dishes to subscribers and would have been 80% Canadian-owned.  CRTC
said it recognized need for DBS to be alternative to cable in rural
areas as well as competitor elsewhere, and it will open another
round of DBS applications to cable providers no sooner than 6
months after ExpressVu and Power DirecTV begin.  Shaw Pres.-COO
James Shaw said company would "actively pursue this opportunity."

     Power DirecTV, owned by Power Bcstg. (80.01%) and DirecTV,
plans to broadcast U.S. and Canadian programming via DirecTV and
Telesat Anik E-2, respectively.  License, to expire in Aug. 2002,
will be issued as soon as Power DirecTV is incorporated in Canada. 
Power DirecTV had wanted CRTC to levy fee on cable subscribers to
help pay for its communications costs, but agency denied request.

     CRTC approved following U.S.-based services for distribution
by Power DirecTv:  A&E, BET, Comedy Central, CNBC/Financial News
Network, CNN, CNN Headline News, C-SPAN, Kaleidoscope, KRMA-TV
(PBS) Denver,  KTLA (Ind.) L.A.,  Learning Channel, Lifetime TV,
Nashville Network, WABC-TV (ABC) N.Y., Weather Channel, WFLD (Fox)
Chicago, WGN-TV (Ind.) Chicago, WPIX (Ind.) N.Y.,  WRAL-TV (CBS)
Raleigh-Durham, WSBK-TV (Ind.) Boston, WTBS (Ind.) Atlanta, WWOR-TV
(Ind.) N.Y.-Secaucus, N.J., WXIA-TV (NBC) Atlanta.

     ExpressVu, which would use Anik E-1 beginning in June, is
owned by BCE Inc. (33-1/3%), Tee-Comm Electronics (33-1/3%),
Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom, 19%), WIC Western
International (14-1/3%).  U.S.-based channels would include:  A&E,
BET, CNBC/Financial News Network, CNN, CNN Headline News, Comedy
Central, C-SPAN, Kaleidoscope, KTLA L.A., Learning Channel,
Lifetime TV, Nashville Network, WDIV (NBC) Detroit, Weather
Channel, WTBS Atlanta, WGN-TV Chicago, WPIX N.Y., WSBK-TV Boston,
WTOL-TV (CBS) Toledo, WTVS (PBS) Detroit, WUHF-TV (Fox) Rochester,
WWOR-TV N.Y.-Secaucus, WXYZ-TV (ABC) Detroit.

     CRTC Chmn. Keith Spicer said Commission's decision introduces
competition and provides alternative to cable.  Licenses require
use of Canadian rather than U.S programming when similar services
are available and would minimize ratio of U.S.-to-Canadian services
providers can offer.  Commission decided not to regulate DBS rates,
as it does cable, saying that it believes competition between 2
services would keep prices low.

     CRTC also licensed 4 English-language and one French-language
DTH, pay-per-view services.  Sports/Specials and Power DirecTicket
will be distributed nationally, Home Theatre will serve Western
Canada, Viewer's Choice Eastern Canada.  Canal Premiere, French
service, will be offered nationally.  CRTC licensed 4 digital pay
audio services for carriage by all distribution systems, including
DTH, cable and DBS:  Allegro, DMX Canada, Galaxie, Power Music
Choice.  Commission rejected application by Power DirecTV to
operate French-language DTH pay-per-view because of concerns it
wouldn't meet Bcstg. Act terms.  CRTC projected in its ruling that
service would lose $3.7 million over 7 years and probably wouldn't
be able to offer as many Canadian-based programs as Act mandates.

     Ohio PUC received flood of comments on its generic competition

     Ohio PUC received flood of comments on its generic competition
docket, which proposes rules to open local loop.  TW recommended
PUC adopt bill-and-keep interconnection and regulatory parity to
"not unduly burden new entrants with requirements designed for
regulated monopolies."  It also urged PUC to scrap proposed rules'
current service area definition that it said "reflect[s] a
one-provider, one-technology world" and instead allow technology
and markets to define it, and exempt facilities-based entrants from
having to resell services "before they have an opportunity to get
into the business."  Ameritech charged that proposed rules would
"violate the public interest test" by allowing entrants to bundle
service offerings and escape universal service obligations while
denying same benefits to Ameritech, which would be forced to charge
"uneconomic" wholesale interconnection rates.  Ohio Office of
Consumer Counsel (OCC) suggested that PUC add to its proposal,
among other things, more specifics on universal service, basic
service tariff requirements, 3-year exemption from competition for
small telcos, bill-and-keep interconnection regime to account for
traffic imbalances.

connections.  (2) "Basic-Residential" for nonbusiness lines.  (3)
"Basic-Other" for business lines.  (4) Discretionary, covering
optional services such as call waiting and call forwarding.  (5)
Competitive, for services offered by other providers such as
Centrex and speed dialing.  BA said it will cap access and
basic-residential rates for 2 years, basic-other for one year. 
After that, BA said, it would adjust services based on Gross
Domestic Product price index minus 1.5%.  Discretionary services
wouldn't rise more than 25% per year, BA said, but competitive
services would be unregulated.  It also said plan would preserve
existing quality-of-service standards.  MCI submitted its own price
cap plan for BA last month that it claimed would shave $72 million
off intrastate toll rates.  BA has criticized plan as
"rate-of-return in sheep's clothing," saying it underestimated
universal service costs by $47 million (CM Nov 27 p8).

     Ohio PUC should intervene in interconnection negotiations

     Ohio PUC should intervene in interconnection negotiations
between Time Warner (TW) and Ameritech because telco wants to
charge "excessive" rates for "some key services" and hasn't
provided cost justifications, TW said in letter to PUC Chmn. Craig
Glazer.  TW also charged that although it has reached deals on all
technical issues, it "has not been negotiating directly with those
individuals in Ameritech who can finally explain, modify and
conclude interconnection agreements."

     FCC at agenda meeting in mid-Dec. proposed compensation

     FCC at agenda meeting in mid-Dec. proposed compensation
arrangements for LEC-wireless interconnection that would mandate
interim use of "bill-and-keep" as reimbursement method.  Under
bill-and-keep, each carrier terminates calls for others at no
charge.  Commissioners said bill-and-keep isn't ideal system, but
speed is of essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an
economically perfect system would be the enemy of the economic
good."  Beauty of bill-and-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney said, because it
doesn't require setting up new billing systems.  Although it
considers bill-and-keep "preferred" solution, Commission will seek
comments on other options such as setting uniform rate, charging
whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to terminate calls, picking
up one of various state solutions.  Comr. Ness said she would be
willing to listen if someone came up with better system "but it's
got to be less regulatory and it's got to be speedy."  Need for
state role was emphasized, with Chmn. Hundt noting, "we have a good
relationship with the state commissions and we don't want to lose
it... We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting state PUCs
is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate traffic. 
Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.
