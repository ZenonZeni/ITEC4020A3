New Jersey Releases Hospital-Specific C-Section Rates


The primary, or first-time, cesarean section rate for New Jersey hospitals was
17.67 percent in 1994, down from 18.23 percent in 1993, according to a
hospital-specific report released by the New Jersey Hospital Assn.  that
covers 67 acute care hospitals.  This is the first release of
hospital-specific clinical data in NJHA's 77-year history.

The 17.67 rate (see chart, next page) is down from 18.23 percent in 1993, but
is higher than the national average of 15 percent and higher than the 17.02
percent for the rest of the Northeast, says NJHA.  The c-section rate ranged
from a 1994 high of 28.12 percent (LHS-Meadowlands Hospital) to a low of 9.73
percent (Memorial Hospital of Salem).

The results are particularly meaningful, says NJHA, because primary c-sections
most accurately reflect medical indications and not patient preference.  In
addition, the NJHA report provides a variance rate for each hospital, which
shows the difference between the hospital's predicted rate - based on such
risk-adjustment factors as socioeconomic conditions and demographics and the
medical condition of the mother and baby - and its actual rate.  The report
then indicates whether each hospital performed fewer or more first-time
c-sections than predicted.  Nonetheless, the study "is not flawless,"
acknowledges NJHA.  Rates are based on code information submitted by hospitals
as part of the Uniform Billing data, but not every hospital codes the same
way.  A task force of New Jersey obstetricians is currently developing
consistent definitions for diagnoses and guidelines for when such coding
should be used.  New Jersey hospitals, says the Association, will work with
physicians and the public to lower the number of c-sections by:

* endorsing active labor management; * increasing peer reviews; and *
encouraging physicians to turn babies while still in utero.

NJHA will also initiate an educational program for consumers, particularly
those many women who have had previous c-sections and refuse to try a VBAC
(vaginal birth after cesarean) delivery.  Brochures on c-sections will be
distributed to obstetricians and hospitals across the state.

AMA Delegates Defeat Mandatory Point-of-Service Proposal


The American Medical Assn.  will not use its influence to try and force all
managed care plans to provide a point-of-service (POS) feature for all
enrollees at all times.  A move to do so was voted down by the AMA House of
Delegates in a contentious battle.

Favoring access to providers outside a plan at any time were many specialty
societies whose members have seen their practices eroding and who feel that
such access for a reasonable additional copayment benefits patients.  Among
those against mandatory out-of-network access were physicians who have formed
their own health plans in competition with HMOs.  Others felt that mandatory
POS plans would greatly increase plan expenses.

Existing AMA policy, affirmed by the House of Delegates, endorses the
proposition that patients be given the option to elect or reject a POS option
when joining a plan and during annual open enrollment.

Colorado Coronary Care Consortium Has its Plug Pulled


The Rocky Mountain Heart Consortium, which has been collecting data relating
to heart disease from Colorado hospitals in order to determine and compare
quality of care, closed its doors December 31 because of lack of funding for
continued operations.

The nonprofit Consortium, made up of Colorado hospitals, physician groups, and
community members, was founded in 1991 to maintain a high level of quality and
to keep costs down.  This past year, when contributions were asked of 14
Colorado hospitals, only eight signed up.  When it became evident that there
would be financial problems and lack of wide support, the Consortium's board
of directors decided to end its mission.

During the Consortium's existence it was instrumental in decreasing the number
of open heart surgeries in the state.  It also restrained hospitals from
purchasing potentially profitable - but unnecessary - equipment.  One
researcher for the Consortium told UM that the major reason the Consortium
went out of business is a change in climate in Colorado since the Consortium's
inception; namely, hospital mergers and the emergence of managed care.  "The
bottom line is cost," she said.  "Perhaps we'll come around to quality again -
but it's not happening right now."  Managed care isn't interested in seeing
data, she adds, because they "know" they are giving good care.

The demise of the Consortium and its data collection capabilities coincides
with the Colorado Health Data Commission being voted out of existence by the
state legislature.  Soon it will only be hospitals gathering their own data -
and there will be no mechanism for comparisons, says a spokesperson for the
defunct Consortium.

A Denver Post editorial places a lot of blame on the Colorado Hospital Assn.
for contributing to the deaths of the Health Data Commission and the
Consortium.  "The death of the Heart Consortium, a casualty of parsimony and
fear in the health care sector, is but an early warning sign of even more
troubled times ahead," the editorial says.

Critical Pathways:  Perhaps Ineffective, But Here to Stay 


While critical pathway programs being used by the nation's health care
organizations affect the care of thousands of patients daily, there is no hard
evidence of their effectiveness, according to an analysis that appears in the
Dec.  15 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The authors of the Annals study, who practice at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and Partners Community Health Care in Boston,
believe that critical pathways hold promise for reducing costs and improving
quality.  And managed care organizations are increasingly pressuring hospitals
to use pathways to deal with unexplained variations in medical practice and to
improve care.

Despite the growing popularity of pathways, "no controlled study has shown a
critical pathway to reduce the duration of hospital stay or to decrease
resource use, nor has any study shown critical pathways to improve patient
satisfaction or outcomes," the researchers say.  In addition, they point out
that many physicians view critical pathways as "cookbook medicine."

Uncertainties aside, pathways are a tool that is here to stay.  Therefore, the
researchers offer some ideas on how best to implement them.  If critical
pathways are to live up to their promise, "full and informed participation of
physicians" in the development of critical pathways is necessary.  The
researchers suggest that a "physician-expert" lead the multidisciplinary team
that develops a critical pathway.  Such a physician, they say, lends
credibility and "builds a foundation of support among all clinicians."

The researchers also explain their approach to critical steps in the pathway
development process, including evaluating current care processes, evaluating
medical evidence and the practices of other providers, and structuring the
critical pathway in a way that is "user friendly."

HMO Medical Director Faces Felony Charge Because Not Licensed in Florida


The medical director of a Florida-based HMO responsible for overseeing the
plan's UM decisions got into big trouble because he wasn't licensed to
practice medicine in the state.

Roger Strube, MD, the former medical director of AV-Med Health Plan, who is
licensed in Indiana and Wisconsin, is charged with approving and/or
recommending courses of medical care and treatment in violation of a Florida
law prohibiting the unlicensed practice of medicine.  He is also charged with
violating a requirement of the state's HMO regulatory body, the Agency for
Health Care Administration, that prepaid Medicaid health plan medical
directors hold a valid state license to practice medicine.

Strube is pleading not guilty to the felony charges in what GHAA/AMCRA calls
"perhaps the first case of its kind in the country."

Strube is not in violation of any law, insists Richard Dorff, executive
director of the Florida Assn.  of HMOs.  He tells UM that under the relevant
state statute, the professional judgment of a physician licensed in Florida
concerning the proper course of treatment of a health plan member "should not
be subject to modification by the [managed care] plan or its board of
directors or administrators .  .  ."  However, it goes on, the statute "shall
not be considered to restrict a utilization management program established by
an organization."  And that's all that Strube was doing, says Dorff -
utilization management.  He adds that the attending physician has the sole
responsibility for attending the patient, but that the statute doesn't
preclude a medical director from reviewing clinical criteria with the
physician.

Subsequent to the charges being brought against Strube, and because of the
case, Medicaid contracts have to stipulate that the chief medical director of
a commercial HMO must be licensed in the state.  Another law requires that
doctors using telemedicine must be licensed in Florida.

Is there a movement in Florida to thwart the benefits of managed care?  "It
certainly could be interpreted as such," says Dorff.

Patients May Also Be at Risk When Docs Are Paid Capitated Rates


Physician groups that have capitated payment arrangements directly with HMOs
enjoy practicing medicine without payers' interventions in their medical
decisions.  These arrangements, though, raise eyebrows in some quarters about
utilization and quality of care.

Six California medical groups paid by capitation are subjects of a study
appearing in the Dec.  21 New England Journal of Medicine.  Researchers found
that the groups have relatively low rates of hospital utilization and
physicians per enrollee.  The study also notes that managing utilization
through the groups' own medical directors and physician committees creates a
cooperative rather than an adversarial approach to utilization management.

The same issue of NEJM presents results of a telephone survey of 138 managed
care plans from 20 metropolitan areas nationwide.  Among the findings:  "Fifty
percent of the group or staff HMOs and 74 percent of the network or IPA HMOs
adjusted payments [to physicians] according to utilization and cost patterns."

In an accompanying editorial, Steffie Woolhandler, MD, and David Himmelstein,
MD, oft-quoted critics of the health care system, look at risk-sharing
arrangements and acknowledge the attractiveness of doctors, not insurance
executives, managing medical care.  They bemoan the idea, though, that some
doctors will boost their incomes by suppressing the use of services.  "If we
shun the sick or withhold information to benefit ourselves, we conspire in the
demise of our profession," they note.  "Let us not end up like tobacco-company
executives, who, repenting their sins, find that their contracts forbid
confessing them."

Himmelstein, a single-payer health plan advocate, was relieved of his duties
at U.S.  Healthcare effective February 26 because, he says, he violated a
confidentiality clause prohibiting member physicians from saying anything that
could undermine confidence in the plan.  The editorial he co-wrote includes
some disparaging statements about his soon-to-be former employer's gag rules,
profits, chief executive salary, and percentage of income that is spent on
health care.

HMO Opens Health Centers In Medically Underserved Neighborhoods


Oxford Health Plans is opening two community-based health centers in New York
City, the managed care organization announced last week..  Each will be
staffed with at least five board-certified physicians who will serve all
Oxford members, "but particularly those members living in the two low-income
communities currently underserved by physicians and other quality health
professionals," says David Snow, the managed care company's executive vice
president.

One center is scheduled to open this March in the Mott Haven section of the
Bronx, an area with only 42 primary care physicians, or one doctor for every
5,525 people.  Five new physicians, who are members of a professional
corporation under contract to Oxford, increases the number of doctors by 12
percent.  The site, which once housed a supermarket, is being renovated at a
cost of about $1.8 million, according to Oxford.

The other center, to open in June in the Brownsville/East New York section of
Brooklyn, a former furniture building, will be renovated at a cost of about
$1.5 million.  In addition to professional staffing, both centers will have
onsite lab drawing stations and dental and radiology facilities.  They will
maintain a community room and help organize outreach programs to improve the
quality of life in the neighborhoods.

Oxford went the health center route because there is a potential for clients
in the neighborhoods, but no network in place serving the Medicare and
Medicaid population.  "We thought it would be advantageous to the community to
actually put a facility there with doctors who meet our standards," says Bill
Ricco, director of all Oxford Health centers.

Oxford is making a large investment in the centers, and "we hope to at least
break even on it," says Ricco.  He adds that several other areas have been
identified in the New York metropolitan area for similar centers.  "Progress
will depend, to some extent, on what happens in Brooklyn and the Bronx."

HMOs Mislead Medicaid and Medicare Patients, Says NYC Official


A New York City politician doesn't like the advertising generated by HMOs.  A
study of marketing material from six Medicaid or Medicare HMOs led Public
Advocate Mark Green to refer several of the ads "that appear the most
misleading" to the state's attorney general for possible action.

"Our investigation showed that for some HMOs, the letters stand for 'Hyping
Medicine to the Old,'" says Green.  Examples of misleading ads, according to
Green, include "we are #1" data from one plan's survey being used to advertise
another of its plans.  Still other plans promise "something for nothing,"
ignoring the fact that to qualify for the Medicare managed care plans,
"recipients still have to pay their Medicare Part B premiums - a fact
conveniently buried in their marketing materials."

Oxford Health Plan of New York, one of the accused HMOs, retorts that every
advertisement and marketing brochure is reviewed and approved by city and
federal regulators.

In a separate Public Advocate report, Oxford did indeed come out Number One
with regard to the greatest number of primary care doctors and the largest
proportion who are board certified.  Not faring as well was the only nonprofit
HMO in the report, the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, which had
the greatest number of valid complaints from patients.  Almost all the HMOs
did not provide accurate basic information over the phone, says the report.
For example, patients had been told by two HMOs that they have 48 hours to
call for approval when admitted to a hospital emergency room, when in fact the
plan requires a call within 24 hours.

DEVELOPMENTS IN BRIEF


A physician profiling bill that would provide $335,000 for the state medical
board to compile information for consumers about physicians, including their
malpractice history, passed the Massachusetts Senate in December.  The House
is expected to pass the legislation in about a month, prior to its expected
signing by Gov.  William Weld (R).

Case management guidelines to reduce medical costs, enhance health care
quality, and increase provider and patient satisfaction have been developed by
Aetna Health Plans in collaboration with the Individual Case Management
Association.  Aetna started with generic guidelines applicable to all cases
and then created specific ones for high-cost, catastrophic cases, such as
AIDS, high-risk pregnancy, organ transplants, brain injury, and spinal cord
injury.  There are separate guidelines for workers' compensation cases.
Copies of the case management practice guidelines may be obtained from Mosby,
Inc.  by calling 800/633-6699.

HEDIS should provide a mechanism for companies to track their own quality
improvement rather than compare individual plans in a way that implies one's
superiority over another, according to USQA, the research arm of the managed
care company U.S.  Healthcare.  An article in USQA Quality Monitor shows how
U.S.  Healthcare used HEDIS to improve its rate of giving retinal exams to
diabetics.  After consecutive years with rates of only 35.1 percent and 35.9
percent, letters were sent to physicians and to diabetic patients reminding
them of recommendations for yearly exams.  The percentage for 1994 jumped to
41.6 percent, even though the quality improvement program was not implemented
until mid-year.

Boston's Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School have formed a
foundation for research and medicine in order to avoid overlapping of the
academic and clinical missions of both institutions.  The restructuring of the
longstanding relationship between the two institutions was deemed necessary
because of declining financial support for medical education and the changing
methods of delivering and paying for health care.  Cost-cutting and clinical
treatment beyond the usual bounds of the teaching hospital are making some of
the traditional strategies for training doctors obsolete, say hospital and
school spokespersons.

Female heart attack patients received clot-busting drugs nearly one-half hour
later than their male counterparts, according to a two-year study conducted at
two suburban Michigan hospitals, which is reported in the January issue of
Annals of Emergency Medicine.  In addition, more than half the men received an
ECG within 15 minutes of arrival to the emergency department, while less than
40 percent of women were tested during this time.

Maternity stay legislation is expected to be considered in the 1996
legislatures of the following states:  California, Connecticut, Delaware,
Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Rhode
Island, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Meanwhile, on its own, George
Washington University Hospital in Washington DC plans to permit women who have
normal deliveries to remain hospitalized for as long as two days - a day
longer than most managed care plans pay for.  "We felt it was time for the
clinicians to be ahead of the legislators, and not necessarily have something
mandated," says Keith Ghezzi, the hospital's medical director.

Increasingly, medical resources are being used on patients with somatic
symptoms that have no pathophysiological explanation.  The reasons include
little financial disincentive to seek treatment because of enrollment in a
prepaid health plan and lower tolerance of mild symptoms and benign
infirmities.  A report in the Dec.  27 Journal of the American Medical Assn.
says that a gatekeeper primary care physician could make it easier to detect
and control physician shopping and to prevent fragmented care, excessive
testing, and the overuse of specialty consultations.  "Medical personnel need
to remind both their patients and the public that not every symptom denotes
disease, and despite modern biomedicine's stunning advances, there remains a
great deal it cannot cure," say the researchers.

There is evidence that competitive pricing among HMOs brings rewards to their
customers, according to a just-released market report by InterStudy.  For
example:  It appears that family premiums are lower in markets with high
enrollment growth.  And, on average, medical expense ratios tend to be lower
in markets with low industry penetration but with a greater number of HMOs.

Regardless of the budget debate outcome, the growth of Medicare managed care
is expected to continue, says a spokesperson for The Managed Care Information
Center.  Currently, the largest managed care provider for a Medicare
population is PacifiCare with 481,365 subscribers in the West, Northwest, and
Southwest, according to an enrollment study by the Center.  Next in order of
size are FHP with 369,305 subscribers; Kaiser Foundation HP, with 353,455
covered lives; Humana Group Health Plan, with 307,155 members; and U.S.
Healthcare, with 72,192 subscribers.

Managed care tends to prevent people with rare diseases from being referred to
university-affiliated hospitals, the institutions most likely to have
physicians familiar with such diseases, says the National Organization for
Rare Disorders.  The consequences, according to NORD, are denial of access to
specialists, young doctors not being trained to recognize rare disorders and
their treatment, and the severe economic problems of teaching hospitals which
may force many of them to close.

Disease management techniques (UM 12/21/95) are now being used with organ
transplants.  Sandoz, a pharmaceutical company that manufactures a drug that
helps prevent organ rejection, and Value Health, a provider of specialty
managed care benefit programs, have joined forces to design and offer
programs, products, and services that will help health care providers enhance
patient care, further improve organ survival rates, promote organ donation,
and manage costs.

The National Institutes of Health have turned out to be a winner in the budget
battle with a 5.8 percent increase in funding for a full fiscal year.  In an
about face, Republicans determined that biomedical research fosters economic
growth.

REPORT FROM THE FIELD:  Consulting Firm Produces Health Plan "Report Cards"
for Employers


Taking advantage of employers' hunger for information on health plans'
performance, the employee benefits consulting firm Hewitt Associates recently
launched its own health plan "report card" involving plans in 75 markets and a
proprietary set of performance indicators.

To date, 130 large national employers have signed on for Hewitt's Health Value
Initiative (HVI), which was rolled out in early December.  Participants
include such Fortune 500 companies as Marriott International, IBM, and United
Airlines.  The fee depends on what a company wants in how many markets, but is
less than if the regional reports had to be customized, says a Hewitt
spokesperson.

HVI has been designed to simplify the plan evaluation process by providing
participating employers with regional cost and quality of care scores for each
plan offered in a region.  Results will be available in late March (see figure
1, next page), but if an employer wants additional updates, Hewitt will work
with it on an individual basis.

Financial Index

For the HVI, Hewitt is using its own performance indicator sets, dubbed the
"Financial Index" and "Quality Index."  The Financial Index is an actuarial
study that determines the economic value of each plan.  It is based on
premiums adjusted for location, enrollee demographics, dependent coverage,
plan design, and managed care efficiency.  ("Managed care efficiency" refers
to the efficiency of the mix of plans a large employer offers - typically HMO,
point-of-service (POS), and indemnity.  An employer who knows relative
efficiencies may want to look at the direction in which it should be steering
employees.)

With the Financial Index, the employer is able to determine whether a plan
provides good economic value, says Tom Beauregard, principal in Hewitt's
Rowayton CT office and chief architect of the HVI.  "We are testing the value
of a plan's cost relative to the population enrolled in that plan.  So we look
at the age of the population, male/female distribution, number of dependents,
and geographic location of enrollees.  We are basically coming back to the
employer to say whether this is good or bad economic value based on this
actuarial study.  It's not a simple survey; it's a refined analysis of the
economic value of health plans being offered to employers."

"Employers," says Beauregard, "will also be able to see the range of economic
value that each of their health plans is offering other participating
employers.  We may say to a company that a health plan is offering a good
value in actuarial terms, but it's not the best value out there.  We can show
the range of economic values from the 30 or so companies within our study that
use this health plan.  In other words, two employers with the same health plan
can in fact be paying different amounts, depending on a number of factors,
including negotiating skill."

Quality Index

The Quality Index is based on a Request for Information (RFI) to the health
plans in the 75 markets, along with a scoring process.  The RFI asks for
measures of clinical quality (clinical processes, physician/hospital
management, and quality improvement and utilization), administrative
effectiveness (member services, access, ID card issuance, and post-65
coverage), and organizational effectiveness (provider compensation, financial
stability, membership, and National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)
accreditation status).  An RFI will be sent out annually, but a health plan
has the opportunity to update its information at any time for inclusion in
Hewitt's ongoing database, says Beauregard.

An RFI was sent in mid-December to over 1,000 HMOs, POS plans, PPOs, and
indemnity plans in the 75 markets, and the results will be sent to employers
at the end of March.  The health plans are expected to answer all questions
because they have done so before on behalf of individual Hewitt clients and
because the questions are based largely on the familiar Health Plan Employer
Data and Information Set (HEDIS 2.5) developed by NCQA, the HMO accrediting
group.  Beauregard says that there are about 40 questions asked, half of which
are HEDIS.  If a plan has filed HEDIS information, it can just attach it to
the questionnaire rather than reanswer the questions for Hewitt.

Regarding authentication of responses relating to a plan's quality, Beauregard
says the RFI is very specific.  "In terms of utilization measures, we ask the
health plans to use the HEDIS 2.5 methodology for calculating rates.  If they
haven't used it, we ask them for their methodology - for kind of a paper audit
of the methodology."

The health benefits consultant doesn't expect to do onsite procedural audits
as part of the HVI.  But, he says, "we have gone through the study many times
with employers on their larger plans and frequently have gone onsite for
operational, procedural, and clinical audits.  But those audits for individual
employers tend to be for their largest plans that through a scorecard process
have a high variant compared to other plans.  So the Quality Index that is
part of the HVI is a great way for employers to trigger the plans for which
they want onsite audits.  The triggers typically are a large enrolled
population in that plan and how that plan did relative to other plans in the
same community."

Hewitt vs.  HEDIS

Beauregard insists that Hewitt in no way means to supplant, or compete with,
HEDIS.  He says that even though the HVI is new, Hewitt - which according to
NCQA, is a member of a HEDIS users' group - has been offering financial
scorecards to its clients for the past five years, and quality scorecards for
three.  A spokesperson for NCQA finds no fault with Hewitt's use of HEDIS
questions.

Beauregard adds that while HEDIS questions focus on utilization rates, such as
a child's immunization rate within the first two years of life, the Hewitt RFI
goes beyond that by asking questions about administrative effectiveness,
organizational stability, member services, products available, service area
information, provider compensation, and financial ratios of the health plan.
Data, Not Decisions

"We've found that on average 45 percent of each employer's plans cost more
than the community average," says Beauregard.  "If all of those plans achieve
average cost efficiency, employers could save 3 percent to 5 percent of their
total health care costs.  We've also found an average 18 percent difference
between the most efficient and least efficient health plans, making the
potential for savings even greater."

These figures obviously are not from the recently-initiated HVI.  "We've done
these kinds of studies in individual cases across the country for the last
several years," says Beauregard.  "This is the information we have extracted
from our database."

"We provide data findings and advice, but ultimately it's the employer that
makes the decision," says the Hewitt principal.  "An employer, for example,
may look at a plan and note that in his marketplace the plan has the highest
quality score and provides the highest economic value - but that he has a very
small part of his population in that plan.  The employer at that point may try
to encourage migration into that plan from other plans in that same
marketplace.  It comes down to the employers' objectives.

"What's customized about HVI is the employers' application of the findings.
There is no one answer for what employers do with the data.  The data provide
a regional description of the value of each health plan the employer is
offering.  What the employer does with that information is going to vary
across the board."

Whether cost or quality receives more attention depends on the employer, says
Beauregard.  He says that many large employers focus almost entirely on the
quality of care that's being delivered.  Others focus almost all their energy
on the economic efficiency of the plan.  Most employers fall somewhere
between.

An Employer's Perspective

Rohm & Haas, a global specialty chemical company headquartered in
Philadelphia, has signed on to Hewitt's Health Value Initiative and will
receive reports on about 30 health plans for all its U.S.  locations.  In
addition, the company is having Hewitt conduct onsite audits of health plans
at its three major locations:  U.S.  Healthcare for the Philadelphia area,
Sanus for Houston, and Humana for Louisville.  "It just gets too expensive to
audit everyone," says Lois Morris, BSN, manager of health care and disability
programs.

Morris says that U.S.  Healthcare is a natural for an audit because it is the
company's biggest health plan provider and will be used as a benchmark.  It is
also the plan with which employees are most satisfied.  On the other hand,
Sanus is also a natural because a Hewitt analysis and a satisfaction survey
have indicated problem areas.  "We work with Hewitt by building on previous
analyses," explains Morris.

Quality analyses weren't available not so many years ago under the old
indemnity system, says the company benefits administrator.  "We had to assume
that doctors practiced high quality medicine.  There was no attempt, unless
state by state, such as Pennsylvania's Health Care Cost Containment Council,
to measure quality."

"Primarily," says Morris, "we want to be comfortable that these very
profitable companies, such as U.S.  Healthcare, are delivering cost-efficient
and quality plans.  We look at the Health Value Initiative as an opportunity
to partner with the HMOs for improvement.  In other words, we are not
interested in saying an HMO's immunization rates or mammogram rates are low
for this area, and therefore we want money back.  We want the HMO to tell us
what they plan to do to increase that rate so that it exceeds local standards.
And then we want to relay this information back to employees in order to make
them comfortable with the choices that we are offering.  The unions are also
interested in that because neither do they want to hear complaints about
HMOs."

We also want to say to the health plan that we've given it ample opportunity
to improve, says Morris.  "We certainly would consider eliminating a plan that
shows no interest in improving the quality of health care delivery."

"The services of Hewitt do not come cheaply," adds Pat Coyle, director of
benefits and workforce strategies.  "But we feel it's money well spent when we
see an increase in quality.  The Health Value Initiative also lets us know how
our costs compare with the costs of other companies, and this puts us in a
good bargaining position."

HEDIS information, says Coyle, is only part of the basis for a clinical
assessment.  "Hewitt fine-tunes HEDIS information and takes it to another
level, adding what is important to our employee population."

Overall health care costs have been pretty flat over the past couple of years,
says Coyle, largely because 80 percent of the company's employees, thanks to
incentives, have enrolled in HMOs.  "We have to be able to go back to those
employees to assure them that we are working to improve the health benefit
program.

"And even though costs are flat, it's still a $50 million expenditure for the
company.  We can't continue to shell out that kind of money without some
quality indicators that give us confidence in our plans."  -KM
