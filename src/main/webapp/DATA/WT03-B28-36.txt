BOEING NEARLY DOUBLES AIRBUS ORDERS, DELIVERIES IN 1995

     Despite losing some important orders to Airbus Industrie in 1994
and 1995, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group roughly doubled the number
of orders Airbus received last year. Boeing reported orders totaling
261 aircraft valued at $18 billion, compared to Airbus's total of 106
orders with a total value of $7 billion.
     The 1995 orders are in contrast to a much more comparable figure
for 1994. In that year, Airbus received slightly more orders, 125,
valued at $9.1 billion, than Boeing, which received 120 orders with a
value of $7.8 billion.
     Boeing's 1995 deliveries also were nearly double that of Airbus.
Boeing completed and delivered 206 commercial aircraft to customers,
while Airbus delivered 124 aircraft to 30 customers. However, Airbus
sales in 1995 totaling $9.6 billion were a one-year record for the
European aircraft consortium.
     The sales increase was due primarily to a higher proportion of
widebody aircraft deliveries, principally the A330 and A340, 49 of
which were delivered, 15 more than in 1994. The number of deliveries
of A320 and A321 aircraft increased to 56, while 19 A300s and A310
widebodies also were delivered. The number of Airbus operators
increased from 123 to 131 in 1995.
     Among the orders received by Airbus in 1995, 81 were for the
A319/320/321 family; 19 were for A330/A340 aircraft, and 6 were for
A300s/A310s. New Airbus customers included Midway Airlines, TACA
International; Air Jamaica; Aer Lingus and Yemenia Airways.
     At the end of 1995, Airbus had an order backlog of 578 aircraft
valued at $46.4 billion. Of 1,935 total Airbus orders from 122
customers in the consortium's history, 1,357 have been delivered.
     Boeing's total of 206 deliveries in 1995 includes 36 aircraft in
the fourth quarter, which was lower than anticipated due to its
machinists' strike. The fourth quarter's 36 deliveries consisted of
nine 737s, five 747s, four 757s, twelve 767s and six 777s. For the
year, Boeing delivered eighty-nine 737s, twenty-five 747s, forty-three
757s, thirty-six 767s and thirteen 777s.

TAIWANESE COMPANY PLANS PANAMANIAN AIRLINE

     A Taiwanese airline company plans to begin an intercontinental
airline in Panama, sources say. Evergreen Marine Corp., which founded
Eva Airways, will boost its involvement in Panama in part because of
the confidence Evergreen Chairman Chang Jung-fa has in the Panamanian
government, the sources tell World Airline News. Chang was named an
investment adviser to Panamanian President Ernest Perez Balladares
last year.
     The airline is expected to begin international service from
Panama by July, the sources say. Equipment being considered for the
venture include 767 and 757 equipment from Boeing and A340 and A330
aircraft from Airbus Industrie.
     Eva has applied with Panamanian authorities to begin an airline
that will fly to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia, sources
say, adding that the airline has long-term plans to operate to the
U.S., Europe and Asia. Eva also has asked Panama's incumbent
international airline, copa, to become a minority shareholder, the
sources say, but has not yet received any response. The offer was made
in November.
     Eva Airways now operates long-haul service from Taipei to Los
Angeles and last year began linking that daily trip with Panama.

AIRBUS BEGINS 1996 WITH FLURRY OF AIRCRAFT ORDERS

     Airbus Industrie launched 1996 with a surge of orders from four
customers. Philippine Airlines had by far the largest order of the
four -- 24 aircraft, including four long-range A340-300 widebodies, 8
A330-200 twin-engine widebodies, and 12 A320 narrowbody planes. The
orders make it only the second airline in the world to have ordered
these three Airbus types.
     Delivery of PAL's Airbus aircraft begin in the second quarter of
1997, with nearly simultaneous delivery of the first A340 and A330.
The first A320 will be delivered in the third quarter of 1997. PAL has
an additional four A340s from a previous order, which get delivered to
PAL at the end of 1996.
     The airline plans to use the new A340s to develop its long-haul
route system, including new nonstops to Europe and North America,
Airbus says. A330s will be used on high-density Asian services and on
medium-to-long range routes as far away as the Middle East.
     PAL also ordered eight 747-400 aircraft from Boeing valued at
$2.7 billion.
     Caribbean carrier BWIA International Airways ordered two A340-300
aircraft, Airbus said Jan. 3, becoming the first Caribbean/Latin
American customer for the four-engine aircraft. The aircraft will be
delivered to BWIA in late 1996. BWIA also receives its first two A320
narrowbodies in June.
     Yemen's Yemenia Airways ordered two A310-300 aircraft and took
options on an additional two, becoming a new Airbus customer. Delivery
of the two aircraft is planned for March 1997. Yemenia will use the
aircraft on nonstop services to Europe, southeast Asia and the U.S.,
as well as on regional routes. The airline will have the airplanes
configured to 191 passengers in three classes of service. Choice of
engines has not been made.
     Airbus's fourth customer, leasing concern GATX Capital Corp.,
ordered nine A321-200 aircraft, the stretched version of the A320
narrowbody. The order was valued by Airbus at $580 million. Deliveries
of the -200, a higher performance version of the -100, begin in April
1997. GATX chose the CFM56-5B engine to power the aircraft.

BRITISH AIRWAYS DECEMBER TRAFFIC RISES 6%-8%

     British Airways was expected to report traffic growth of between
6% and 8% for December, rounding out a period of steady traffic growth
in 1995. However, analysts in Britain claim that most of the  rise in
traffic in December came from increased leisure, not business, travel,
due in part to intra-European and North Atlantic fare sales.

AUSTRIAN'S BAMMER TO FOCUS ON REGULATORY HARMONIZATION,
EUROCONTROL AS AEA PRESIDENT

     Austrian Airlines President Herbert Bammer, who was elected 1996
president of the Association of European Airlines, plans to focus on
harmonization of aviation regulations among European Union states, on
airline certification issues, and on development of a unified European
air traffic control system. "The regulatory work to reshape European
air transport is only half finished," says Bammer. "The time has come
to complete the task, with a genuine effort to remove the remaining
constraints which are keeping costs up, and efficiency down."
     Noting that all three "packages," or phases, of European airline
liberalization measures have now been implemented, Bammer said, "the
industry is standing with one leg inside the single market, while one
leg is still out in the world of inter-governmental political
wrangling."
     Bammer adds, "The politicians have the opportunity to create
effective regulatory bodies out of the JAA [Joint Airworthiness
Authorities] and Eurocontrol [the European ATC system]. JAA is
supposed to become the European counterpart of the respected and
democratically-controlled FAA in the USA." The agency, however, he
says, "has only recently begun its rulemaking task, but already it is
bogged down in bureaucratic muddle and institutional delays, while
democratic control and decision-making is not forthcoming."
     In addition, Eurocontrol has never received the power from the
various European states over which it is supposed to have airspace
control. Bammer says, "I agree with those directors-general in ECAC
[European Civil Aviation Conference] who believe that the know-how of
Eurocontrol -- and JAA -- should be combined with the decision-making
mechanisms of the European Union. Ultimately," he says, "we would see
an agency of the European Union, respecting of course the rights of
non-EU member states."
     And Bammer criticized recent decisions to delay liberalization of
airport ground handling services which, he says, "shows how much
airports are regarded as pieces in the political game.
     "The airports which enjoy monopoly handling, with the guaranteed
income that this means, make profits that the airlines can only dream
about. Not only are we overcharged, we are also prevented from
tailoring our product to our customers' liking."
     Bammer, who recently marked 30 years of service at Austrian, has
been closely involved with AEA since he was named president of
Austrian in 1992. He was chairman of the group's Commercial Affairs
Committee when it introduced the AirPlus credit card. He also
conducted the AEA Global Distribution Study, which resulted in the
launching of the Amadeus and Galileo computer reservations systems.
     Bammer succeeds Roger Sietzen, president of Luxair. Sietzen used
his presidency to promote development of European aviation
infrastructure, speaking widely on the topic throughout Europe in
1995. "Under Seitzen's guidance," says AEA Director-General Karl Heinz
Neumeister, "frequent contacts with [European Union] Transport
Commission Neil Kinnock have been established, and the debate on
infrastructure has been brought firmly into the political arena."
     Two AEA studies were published in 1995, "European Airports --
Getting to the Hub of the Problem, or the Problem of Getting to the
Hub," and "EU External Aviation Relations -- an AEA Policy Statement."
     Late in 1995, AEA attempted to break a deadlock on development of
stricter flight and duty-time rules for cockpit crews but was unable
to persuade senior officials in the Joint Airworthiness Authorities to
consider the document.

AEA REPORTS 7.7% GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN NOVEMBER

     Growth in North Atlantic and Europe-Sub Saharan African markets
highlighted November's international traffic statistics for European
carriers, the Association of European Airlines reported last week.
Traffic to sub-Saharan Africa grew by 15.6% to 2.407 billion revenue
passenger kilometers (RPKs), with capacity in the market growing at
only an 11.7% pace. Load factor, therefore, jumped 2.4 points to
70.8%.
     The statistics indicate continued strong growth in traffic
recovery by Europe's largest airlines, in contrast to a much smaller
level of growth among U.S. carriers that serve international markets.
Only one international market shrank in November -- the Mid-Atlantic.
Traffic in that market decreased 2.9% to a total 1.427 billion RPKs,
but capacity rose 5.5%, so load factor dropped 5.9 points to 66.2%.
     In total, European airlines flew 23.429 billion RPKs in November,
up 7.7%, while capacity rose only 6.5%, to 42.215 billion available
seat kilometers (ASKs). Load factor rose slightly, by 0.8 points, to
65%.
     For January-November 1995, traffic also rose at a 7.7% pace
compared to the same 11-month period in 1994. Total international RPKs
were 344.598 billion, and ASKs rose 5.6% to 487.482 billion. Load
factor increased 1.4 points to 70.7%.
     Traffic in North Atlantic and Sub-Saharan Africa markets outpaced
all others for the first 11 months, showing increases of 9% and 9.4%,
respectively. Next was Geographical Europe, with 8.5%, and 8% in South
Atlantic markets. Among the weakest markets were Mid-Atlantic, with
only 1.6% growth, and Europe-North Africa and the Middle East, which
grew at only a 1.8% clip.
     In freight markets, the South Atlantic was by far the best
performer, growing 14.9% in November and 24.9% for the first 11 months
of 1995.

AER LINGUS NAMES NEW EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

     Aer Lingus, one of the most consistently unprofitable airlines in
Europe, last week named a new executive vice president for North
America. Jack Foley, 42, will be responsible for the airline's passenger
sales and marketing efforts in the continent and will report to David
Bunworth, Aer Lingus's Dublin-based director of sales and marketing.
     Foley comes from British Airways, where he was involved in key
aspects of the successful airline's sales, marketing and information
management areas for 21 years.
     "Aer Lingus regards North America as a key market for further
development," says Bunworth. "This developing market requires dynamic
management at this critical time."

BRITISH AIRWAYS OUTLINES PAY INCREASE PROPOSALS

     British Airways has proposed a 3.1% raise over two years for
unionized workers in ground services, cabin crew, and specialized
"craft" and "non-craft" areas, such as maintenance and engineering. If
accepted by unions, the two-year raise would be retroactive to Jan. 1.
The offer also makes some changes to the airline's profit-sharing
formula and to basic pensions.
     Harvey May, BA's director of human resources, says, "British
Airways' pay rates for many jobs are in the top 10, or 25%, for similar
work in other UK companies. Although the airline is currently enjoying a
successful period, it is vital not to build in permanent costs that
increase the difficulty of any future business decisions when times are
not so good."
     May was quoted in most recent issue of BA News, the airline's
employee newspaper.   The airline's approach to pay rates,
he says, "is to protect against inflation and to tackle any issues of
market comparability when they arise separately from the two-year pay
agreement."
     Profit-sharing arrangements for the 1995-96 fiscal year, BA says,
predict that the average employee will receive 3.75 weeks of pay in
profits. As an example, an individual earning Pounds 310 per week or
below will receive a lump sum payment of Pounds 1,162. If they choose to
invest the funds in BA stock, however, the contribution rises to Pounds
1,395, representing a 20% bonus this year.
     Approximately 66% of BA staff are now company shareholders, BA
estimates, with Pounds 66 million distributed in shares last year, a
threefold increase from the year before.

ROUTE DEVELOPMENTS

     * Greece's Olympic Airways and Brazilian carrier VASP launched
codesharing services between the two countries Jan. 4. The flights,
which operate on Mondays and Thursdays, will use VASP McDonnell Douglas
MD-11 aircraft. The flights originate in Athens and stop in Casablanca
and Rio de Janeiro before ending in Sao Paulo.

     * A third Italian airline is scheduled to enter the Rome-Milan
market, making a further challenge to incumbent Alitalia. Noman Airlines
will begin service Jan. 22, operating six daily flights. The first
competitor to Alitalia was Air One, which began Rome-Milan shuttle
service in November. Although Alitalia and Air One fly out of Fiumicino
Airport, Noman has chosen to begin service from the smaller Ciampino
Airport.

     * China Northwest Airlines will begin service from Xi'an in the
Shaanix Province of North China to Macao starting Jan. 9, Xinhua News
Agency reports. The flights, to be operated twice weekly, will make an
intermediate stop in Changsha. China Northwest is the third mainland
carrier to begin service to Macao, with China National Aviation Corp.
and China Northern now flying there.

     * Air Macao will launch a daily flight between Macao and Koahsiung,
Taiwan, Jan. 12. Air Macao operates twice-daily service between Macao
and Taipei.

     * Air India has begun service to Entebbe International Airport in
Uganda. The airline will operate an Airbus A310 from Bombay on Mondays.
Air India suspended service to Uganda in 1972 when former Uganda
President Idi Amin expelled thousands of Indians from the country.

     * Emirates Airlines of the United Arab Emirates has gained approval
for flights to Australia following the successful conclusion of
bilateral aviation talks between Australia and the UAE in December.
Emirates will fly three weekly nonstops between Dubai and both Melbourne
and one other unnamed airport, using any aircraft.

     * Canada 3000 will enhance service from Edmonton, Alberta, to
Halifax, London Gatwick, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Honolulu effective
with the May 28 schedule change. A total of 14 weekly flights will be
operated, double the number operated last spring.

   * Dee Howard Co. in early December opened a new paint hangar in San
Antonio. Hangar 5 includes 3 million cubic feet of space and can
accommodate all widebody aircraft, including the Boeing 747-400 and
Lockheed L-1011. The center also includes a modern 1,600 air filter
ventilation system. Dee Howard also re-engines aircraft, doing so for 44
727-100 aircraft in the United Parcel Service cargo fleet.

   * China Eastern Airlines ordered two VITAL ChromaView visual systems
from FlightSafety International for use in the airline's A300-600 and
MD-82 cockpit flight simulators. One will be installed on a new A300
simulator in the fourth quarter of 1996, while the MD-82 simulator,
already in use, will be refitted. The ChromaView visual system provides
a higher level of reality and richer scene content. It received the
Federal Aviation Administration's Level "D" certification, the highest
for flight simulators.

   * Nordam Group, which operates flight repair stations worldwide, has

ATLANTA-BASED NEW-START INDEPENDENCE AIR GETS NEW PRESIDENT

   Independence Air, the potential new-entrant airline that wants to
begin widebody transcontinental service using Airbus aircraft, has named
a new president whose goal is to begin service by the second quarter of
this year.
   Roy Hagerty, a 25-year industry veteran, replaces Barry Harris, a
former acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, who
decided to return to his consulting business in Washington after less
than two months with the fledgling firm.
   It was the second such leadership change at Independence Air. Before
Harris, the Department of Transportation indicated to the company that
the appointment of Stephen Quinto, one of the airline's founders, would
be controversial due to the bankruptcy of his last airline,
Northeastern, in 1982.
   Hagerty, who most recently served as president of Airline
Development Group, a consulting firm based in Raleigh, N.C., says the
company needs some $6 million in startup funds to get off the ground.
The company is still looking at Airbus A300B4 aircraft, which can carry
some 270 passengers depending on configuration, but also is a good cargo
aircraft.
   Before his job at Airline Development Group, Hagerty was chairman,
president and CEO of CCAIR, Inc., a U.S. regional airline that operated
as Piedmont Commuter and later USAir Express. Hagerty grew the business
from a money-losing effort in 1983 to a $60 million firm that reported
profits of $4 million in 1991. Before CCAir, Hagerty ran Coastal Air,
which operated Southeastern Airlines, from 1972 to 1983.
   Hagerty told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week that he
plans to hire several former Eastern Airlines officials who had recently
left Independence Air after Harris resigned.

ATA PREDICTS FIRST U.S. AIRLINE PROFIT SINCE 1989

   U.S. airlines should report an annual profit for 1995, their first
since 1989, the Air Transport Association reported last week. A growing
economy, high air fares, limited sales and low fuel prices were the
major contributors, ATA says.
   "1995 was a good year for U.S. airlines, and it came just at a time
when the industry needed a good year," said ATA President Carol Hallett.
"After five long years of losses totaling $13 billion, airlines need
profits to repair balance sheets, buy new aircraft and get ready for the
21st century." Hallett said 1996 looks "hopeful" if the economy remains
healthy, if airline unions cooperate on cost-saving proposals, "and if
the government tax collector keeps his hand out of the industry's
pocket."
   However, Hallett's words seem somewhat hollow after last week's
events concerning the U.S. ticket tax. The 10% excise tax on all tickets
expired on Jan. 1 after Congress was unable to enact a new law
continuing the tax. At first, U.S. airlines simply pocketed the
additional money; however, they began dropping fares by a commensurate
level later in the week. By the end of the week, nearly all large U.S.
airlines had passed the savings associated with the tax on to consumers.
   ATA said a record 548 million passengers boarded U.S. carriers in
1995, a 3.7% increase over 1994's total of 528 million. Revenue
passenger miles totaled 540 billion, up 4%, and passenger load factors
averaged 67%, a post-World War II record. Preliminary data show that
cargo traffic increased a healthy 11%, to 15.2 billion ton miles, while
mail shipments grew at a 4.5% pace to 2.4 billion ton miles.
   For the first three quarters, U.S. airlines reported net income of
approximately $2.2 billion. Noting that Wall Street projections call for
a break-even fourth quarter, "1995 year-end profits are likely to remain
in the $2 billion range," ATA claimed.
