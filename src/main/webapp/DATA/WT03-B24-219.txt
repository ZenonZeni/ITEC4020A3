<H1><CENTER>Wishful thinking</CENTER></H1>



<center><b>By Karen Bernstein<br>



Editor-in-Chief</center></b><p>



One of the constant dilemmas for biotech companies is the multiple audiences to whom they must appeal on a regular basis. For the Wall Street audience, it is generally in a company's interest to project the largest possible market size and hence the maximum future revenue stream for its products in development -- a game that sellside analysts often play with even greater fervor (more on that at a later date). But for a second critical audience, potential pharmaceutical company partners, such projections, and the valuations they imply, can be deal breakers.<P>



Dealmakers from the pharmaceutical side provide mixed reviews about their experiences in negotiating with biotech companies. As might be expected, those whose experiences have been negative can wax long and eloquent on the problems they've run into, while those whose negotiations have run more smoothly tend to trundle along quietly on their way.<P>



Whatever the reality, biotech companies need to know how the pharmaceutical companies look at market projections, and how the senior companies look at biotech proposals. Coming in with reasonable numbers from the beginning, or a willingness to listen to the other side's numbers, can speed the process considerably, and ultimately can make the difference between walking out with a deal or walking out empty-handed.<P>





<B><CENTER>The criticisms</B></CENTER><P>



Critics of biotech proposals aren't hard to find. According to David Brush, director of licensing at Astra Merck, the majority of biotech company proposals considerably overstate the potential market size of their products compared to pharmaceutical company estimates. The differences between the two sides can be substantial. <P>



"I hate to stereotype too much, but if you say it's $100 million, they'll say it's $200-$300 million and up to $500 million, so it can be 200-300 percent off," Brush said. "For example, we're one of the few companies in the gastrointestinal area. A company will come to us and say, ÎThe inflammatory bowel disease population is X.' Our M.D.s will look at it and say, ÎThis portion of the population will be treated with steroids; this portion will be treated another way,' resulting in a lower number."<P>



That's also the opinion of Eileen Mendel and Andrew Becker of The Mendel Group, which consults to biotech companies. They can recite a list of biotech companies whose first products, often second-line therapies or products designed to replace existing treatments, they expect will be far smaller than most Wall Street analyst and company estimates.<P>



<B><CENTER>$82 million gap</B></CENTER><P>



They cited an experience with a drug for which the biotech company had estimated a $100 million potential market. The prospective partner pegged the market at $18 million. The biotech company, they said, had assumed extensive off-label use, little of which was actually likely to occur. At the same time, there was only one potential suitor for the drug.<P>



"The key is that for the majority of companies that only will have one or two suitors, the companies have to get real," Becker said. "If the biotech company had come up with reasonable numbers to begin with, the deal would have gotten done faster."<P>



The reason for the frequent disparity in numbers, said Brush, is not that biotech companies are ignorant, but that the two sides use different methodologies for building their models, and have different motivations behind the building of their projections.<P>



For the biotech companies, the obvious motivation is to build a model showing the biggest market possible in order to lure investors. "Their perception is that if they don't come in with $1 billion projections, people won't listen to them -- I don't know where they get that from," said Ronald Pepin, director of external licensing and technology at Bristol-Myers Squibb. "But you have to think that pharma companies are doing their homework. If someone came to BMS with a $200 million cancer drug we would listen."<P>



At the pharma companies, with no outside constituency to impress, the goal is to project future revenues accurately. "At Bristol-Myers Squibb, where I was previously, and here at Astra Merck, we build our market forecasts not to build the biggest market but to build a realistic market," Brush said. <P>



"They all come in with overinflated estimates of their markets and what kind of market penetration they're going to have," said Pepin. "We don't listen to their market projections -- we do our own." Still, he said, it helps biotech companies to come in with realistic estimates, because it gives the senior partner more faith that the biotech company is realistic about other things as well.<P>



One test he uses to see whether the biotech company really believes in its numbers is to offer a low royalty up to a certain amount of sales and a higher royalty thereafter. "You find out fast that they think their numbers are soft," he said.<P>





<B><CENTER>Different drivers</B></CENTER><P>



The disparity in estimates isn't simply due to different ways of calculating market size, however. Sherry Reynolds, acting president and COO of Exelixis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.) pointed out that some of the gap can be attributed to standard bargaining positions, as each side begins with high and low bids.<P>



 "Where biotech companies are missing the boat is they say Îosteoporosis' or Îcancer' and clearly their drug is only going to be effective in a subset of the patient population, but you only know that once you get into the clinic," said Reynolds. "I don't know that the pharmaceutical companies are any better at it than the biotech companies, but they'll narrow it down sooner as part of the bargaining process."<P>



In fact, because dealmakers like Brush have to present their proposals to committees within their companies for comment and approval, all the incentives work in the opposite direction, to underestimate rather than overestimate a product's potential. "No one on the pharma side wants to overestimate the market. We look at net present value, cash flow, add in the milestone payments," he said. "You can't go in front of your management with a negative value. They'll ask for your numbers and your assumptions. You can't go in and say you're estimating you'll get 100 percent of a market, or 50 percent of the market. You don't want to say it's a $100 million market and have it turn out to be $20 million. It's OK if you say it's $20 million and it turns out to be $50 million."<P>



Reynolds agreed. "They have to position the deal internally. Those market projections have to fit with the parameters of a deal that can be sold internally. No matter how you discount it back, you have to get to a number that can be sold internally."<P>



Another issue cited by Reynolds is the vastly greater resources of the pharma side. "One reason the biotech numbers may be off is because it's very expensive to do that kind of detailed analysis. It's time-consuming and the companies can't afford it. The pharma industry has access to better numbers through its access to the best databases."<P>



<B><CENTER>Find flex points</B></CENTER><P>



The result, Brush said, is "a more complex scenario that tries to forecast more of a real world type of situation. It just reflects the different motivations: one to raise money, and one to create a realistic scenario. But because of those different motivations, it sometimes becomes harder to close the gap."<P>



Reynolds suggested that one way to bridge that gap is for companies to focus on the later-stage numbers in a deal -- e.g., on the future royalty stream, and on how they can share in the benefits if the numbers turn out to be better than projected. For example, if the sales are over X million dollars, the royalty rate would increase.<P>



"Biotech companies should find where the flex points are internally at the pharmaceutical company and help them sell the deal internally, by being willing to put in milestones and other things that are totally dependent on success. If they believe in the product, they should be willing to do that," she said.<P>



Other licensing executives have had more positive experiences in their negotiations with biotech companies. "When you really sit down and talk to them, my experience is that the majority are very realistic," said Anders Wiklund, executive vice president at Pharmacia. "On the last couple of deals, and some I'm talking to now, they have had a pretty good understanding of the potential market for their products."<P>



That includes an understanding of the indications, competition, pricing assumptions and the timing of product approvals. Pharmacia always develops its own numbers as part of the discussions. "If they come up the same it's easy to deal with the issues. We have not had any serious discrepancies in our negotiations," he said.<P>



Juergen Schrenk, vice president of technology management at Corange Ltd., also said it's rare in his experience to see companies come in with their numbers off by an order of magnitude. But when it occurs it's quite discouraging. <P>



<B><CENTER>One wonders</B></CENTER><P>



"It makes you wonder whether they think you're stupid, or it's an outright lie or they didn't do their homework," he said. "But we also see companies come in with good numbers. You have to remember that these are often new markets and our people sometimes have a hard time making estimates. As long as the overall market size is correct, it's our job to reduce that to a more realistic approach."<P>



Schrenk also has had pleasant surprises in his negotiations with biotech companies. "We're looking at a company now that addresses a market that really doesn't exist yet -- their technology could replace an existing technology and actually expand the market quite a bit. These guys are more conservative than our market people. If anything, I'd tell them to be more bold."<P>



Having realistic numbers also increases Schrenk's confidence that the company will be down to earth in other areas, like technical issues. "I'm a big believer in honesty. I like dealing with a realistic, down to earth company."<P>



In Wiklund's view, developing a reasonable estimate of market size takes time, and is something that is teased out as discussions proceed. "It's hard to estimate the market before the scientists have come up with what they think are reasonable indications. So that comes reasonably late in my experience.<P>



"But the important thing is what do you do with these numbers," Wiklund continued. "The important area where market estimates come into play is when you deal with upfront payments and milestones. What we have done a few times is agreed on a higher royalty rate if some higher market size is achieved. And we might pay higher milestones if it's a significant indication versus a minor indication."<P>



Brush suggested that biotech companies, rather than assuming the pharma companies are trying to drive a hard bargain by low-balling their market estimates, should try to validate the numbers. In the end, he said, flexibility is important. "Nobody wants to enter into something with unrealistic expectations."<P>



Thomas Wiggans, president and CEO of Connective Therapeutics Inc. (Palo Alto) pointed out that it doesn't take too many different assumptions to create a very wide gap between projections. This is particularly true when companies are looking at new markets. And before a company has real data, there's not much that can be done beyond estimating the number of patients, the price and the market penetration. Still, he said, when both sides compare notes, it's usually impossible to be orders of magnitude apart. <P>





<B><CENTER>Finding an accommodation</B></CENTER><P>



One way to avoid such problems is to work with the potential partner to develop numbers. "In discussions with potential partners, we frequently focus on presenting the science and the product, and work with them in developing a product profile, asking them to give us their view of the market opportunity," said Laurence Korn,  chairman and CEO of Protein Design Labs Inc. (PDLI, Mountain View, Calif.). "In my experience, our numbers tend to be pretty much the same as theirs within a small percentage. We've never had a disagreement on the market potential of a compound, and that comes from working together to develop a picture of the overall market, and to develop a product profile and clinical development strategy."<P>



PDLI develops a product profile -- the half-life, safety, and other characteristics. If the product then shows efficacy, given its other properties, the company asks what kind of market share its potential partner would anticipate. "We don't come in and say we'll get 100 percent of the market. We listen to them because we want to hear their story and how they envision capturing the market." Thus allowing the pharma company to lay out its estimates can help the biotech company determine if this is a partner that sees a high potential for the product and is willing to work to capture market share.<P>



A high implies a low, too<P>



That doesn't mean that biotech companies don't need to do their homework first and have a realistic sense of the potential market and thus the worth of a compound. "We have somebody in-house who goes out and assesses markets," said Jeremy Levin, president and CEO of Cadus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (New York). "That was one of my first hires at Cadus."<P>



Cadus thus starts with primary research, including interviews with clinicians. The company then double-checks its numbers by looking at publicly available documents where similar calculations have been done, such as analyst reports, as well as through conversations with others in the field.<P>



Biotech companies also need to have a clear sense of the high and low bids that form the parameters of potential deals. "In the case of Geron, we came up with high and low possible bids, whereas a lot of people start with a high bid but don't know what their bottom is," said Becker of The Mendel Group. The company, which successfully negotiated a Japanese deal, presented a knowledgeable picture of the cancer field in Japan, and it structured a realistic deal, he said. "They really did their homework and went in and presented a good case."<P>



"Unless you've crunched all the numbers," added Mendel, "you don't know what you're able to accept on the low end."<P>



They advise their clients to find a consultant to do objective, realistic market models with several price points, so companies can discuss high and low estimates based on interviews with potential users. "The pharma company will generally use their own team to do a reality check, but if they have to do it all, it will take longer," Mendel said.<P>



"The pharma company will do a back-of-the-envelope calculation," said Becker. "If the biotech company comes in with a market estimate that's off by 400 percent, that acts as a red flag. Then the biotech company needs to be able to accept that it doesn't have a $250 million product. What's holding back partnering is people get wedded to their products and their science. These are science-based companies and they fall in love with it."<P>





<B><CENTER>The concrete mindset</B></CENTER><P>



Another problem, more common in the past than today, occurs when biotech companies begin negotiations with a set idea of the total value they expect from a deal. "In the past, companies had a dollar figure in mind and tried to get the numbers to add up to that," Brush said. "Now the majority, especially the smaller companies, are more flexible, more willing to work with you, and they are more willing to be compensated when they hit certain milestones. Some of the more established biotech companies are the ones that come in and do what you saw in 1990 and 1991 -- they come in and say, ÎWe want $50 million.' A lot of smaller companies are trying to work with you to get their first or second deal."<P>



In part, the top-down focus is a function of the ongoing problem created by the dual audience that biotech companies face: the investment community and the pharmaceutical companies. However, this is not the way to get a deal done.<P>



"My opinion is there's too much peer pressure or environmental pressure to come in with big numbers," said Wiggans. "That occurs for two reasons: because big numbers get attention, and because small biotech companies are pretty naive, and have never done market projections. The fact that there's pressure to have billion dollar markets discourages people from coming in with accurate numbers to either pharmaceutical companies or investors. It creates an unrealistic environment. As biotech companies become more sophisticated and have the experience to come in with good numbers, my guess is they get penalized for it."<P>



<B><CENTER>Impact of top-down</B></CENTER><P>



The initial presentation of deals is based on a top-down model at least 50 percent of the time, Reynolds said. "When you ask biotech CEOs who their customer is, they all recognize the pharmaceutical industry, but equally important is the investment community. So lots of times they're saying, ÎMy competition got this deal.' But just because one company got a deal of one size and this one got another, they're not necessarily comparable because they may be in different project areas. The problem is that investors focus on that number in assessing companies. It's an investor-driven problem."<P>



Trying to peg a negotiation to the last big deal doesn't help get a partnership, said Pepin. "When Max Link was at Corange, a company came to us and said, ÎYou'd better hurry, because we're talking to Max Link.' I said, ÎYou'd better get that deal, because there's no way we're going to match it.'"<P>



Mendel agreed. "Looking at comparables isn't really a negotiation on your product."<P>



The tighter budgets for biotech companies is making it easier for the pharma companies to do deals with them. "One of the helpful things is the trend of venture capitalists to put less money into these companies," Brush said. "That is having a trickle down effect: it's driving the move away from the kind of attitude that companies came with, saying Îwe need $50 million or $100 million.' The newer companies have had less money pumped into them that they feel they have to recover, and they seem to be more flexible."<P>





<B><CENTER>The valuation trap</B></CENTER><P>



It's one thing to present unrealistic projections to the outside world. But it's another thing altogether to build a company and spend money on the basis of such projections. When that happens, companies can face reverse sticker shock when they try to realize the value of their investment through a partnership, only to find that they've already put in more money than the rest of the world thinks it's worth.<P>



"One company came in a few years ago and we said their product was worth $2 million," said Brush. "They turned white and said, ÎBut we've put $6 million into the company.' So they're saying they can't negotiate down because they've put the money in. They never did license their compound and they ended up merging into another company."<P>



In these and other situations, biotech companies can get hamstrung by a combination of their valuations and the rate at which they're spending money, putting themselves into a position where they feel compelled to turn down a deal that implies a smaller market size for a product and hence a lesser valuation for the company.<P>



"They can't do the market numbers realistically because if they do that, and it leads to a smaller market, then they won't be attractive to the venture capitalists or public investors unless the business plan -- i.e., the burn rate -- is scaled down to match the likely revenues," Becker said.<P>



There have been times, Brush said, when he lays all the numbers out on the table and shows prospective partners all the models. Even then, the smaller companies have said they can't go for the valuation. "So they end up with nothing or say they'll go talk to someone else," he said.<P>



In the instances where companies do come in with more realistic expectations or more flexibility, it's because they haven't backed themselves into a valuation corner, he said.<P>
