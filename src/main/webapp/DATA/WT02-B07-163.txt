<table border><tr><td><i>"We have a very strong interest in the stable flow of petroleum from the Persian Gulf to Western Europe, Japan, and the United States.  Considering the fact that Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer of oil on a daily basis, on an annual basis, that interest for our economy and the economy of allies in Europe and Japan is a vital, national 
interest. It has been declared to be so and has been deemed to be so by every American Administration back into the late 1940s. It's indisputable, and we will protect those national interests."</i>

<TABLE><TR><TD width=360></TD><TD>State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns<br>July 1, 1996, following fatal bombing of U.S. military residence in Saudi Arabia<br></TD></TR></table></TD></TR></TABLE><br><br><br><img src="t.gif" align="left">he U.S. enjoys the lowest cost energy of anywhere in the world. But the price for that low cost energy is high. Two-thirds of the world's known oil reserves are located in the Persian Gulf. By the year 2010, analysts believe that more than 75% of the world's petroleum needs will be met by Arab nations. Our growing reliance on imported crude oil from the world's most politically volatile region most certainly jeopardizes our nation's economic and national security.<br><br>The price Americans pay for oil at the gasoline pump does not reflect this huge national security cost. To encourage regional geo-political stability and preserve the flow of oil, the federal government provides naval protection for the sea lanes; foreign aid to friendly regimes; and, as demonstrated by the Persian Gulf war, a commitment to use our own military forces when necessary. In addition, the U.S. maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help us weather any temporary supply disruptions.<br><br><br><h3><b>Real Price of Foreign Oil</b></h3><table><td><tr><img src="gaspump.gif" align="right">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates the military costs associated with preserving our energy security to be $35 billion per year.  That means for every $20 barrel of oil, U.S. taxpayers are paying an additional $12 to preserve and protect Mideast oil supplies. Other estimates of the real price of a barrel of oil range much higher.  According to the Economic Strategy Institute, a barrel of foreign oil costs $80. The Rocky Mountain Institute estimates the cost at $106 a barrel. The U.S. General Accounting Office calculates the cost of a barrel of foreign oil as high as $126. <br><br>Our military watch is very costly not just in taxpayer dollars for military expenditures in the volatile region, but also in terms of American lives. In addition to the lives lost in the Persian Gulf war, many view the increasing terrorist activity around the world as just the beginning of an organized resistance to the U.S. presence in the Middle East.<br><br><br></tr></td></table>



<h3><b>Monopoly Pricing of Oil</b></h3><br>Far more threatening to the U.S. economy than the military costs to assure stability in the Mideast is the growing potential for monopoly pricing as the world moves back toward dependence on Persian Gulf oil. According to the DOE, worldwide oil reserves are becoming more concentrated and the world oil market share accounted for by a small number of countries continues to rise. DOE estimates that losses to the U.S. economy from monopoly pricing of oil ranged from $100-$470 billion per year between 1974 and 1990.<br><br><br><h3><b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b></h3><br>The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), of  up to one billion barrels of petroleum products, to assure continued supplies of oil during a national emergency as well as reduce the impacts of a severe energy supply disruption. The federal government spends $300 million per year to operate and manage the reserve.<br><center><h3>A Comparison of Energy Programs, 1975 - 1995</h3><table border><tr><td></td><td><b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b></td><td><b>Ethanol Excise Tax Exemption</b></td></tr><tr><td>Amount of Energy Secured</td><td>587 million bbls of crude oil - enough for 11.1 billion gallons of gasoline</td><td>1.5 billion gallons annually - a total of 12.3 billion gallons since 1975</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. Investment to Date</td><td>$21 billion</td><td>$6 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Annual Fiscal Impact</td><td>$212 million for maintenance plus procurement costs of $25/bbl</td><td>A net savings of $528 million annually due to increased household and business income tax revenue</td></tr><tr><td>Cost/Gallon of Energy</td><td>$0.87/gal of crude oil or $1.89/gal of gasoline</td><td>$0.54/gal of ethanol, a savings of $0.35/gal when budget savings are considered</td></tr><tr><td>Jobs</td><td>67</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>Trade Impact</td><td>Each barrel of oil purchased for the SPR adds to the trade deficit, of which oil counts for 40%</td><td>Reduces MTBE imports by more than 1.2 billion annually, and increases exports of ethanol by-products by $800 million annually</td></tr><tr><td>Gross Domestic Output</td><td>-0-</td><td>$5.7 billion annually</td></tr></table><br><br></center>The U.S.' $21 billion investment in the SPR has generated 67 jobs and contributed to the U.S. trade deficit. In contrast, the $6 billion invested by the U.S. in the ethanol program has generated over 55,000 jobs and a net savings to the Treasury of $528 million a year. Clearly, American taxpayers would be better served by increasing the development and production of alternatives to imported oil, such as ethanol. Promoting domestic, renewable energy sources will increase energy security while ensuring that limited federal resources are spent in the U.S. and not exported offshore in the form of jobs, military protection and American lives. The expanded use of alternatives to petroleum, including renewable ethanol, biodiesel, wind, solar, geothermal, hydro-power, as well as increased domestic oil and gas exploration and production, can fill a market need currently met with imports.</body><center><img src="blue_line.gif" width="100%"></center><p><a href="rfa.html"><img src="b_emblem.gif"></a>Return to <a href="rfa.html">RFA Home Page</a></html>
