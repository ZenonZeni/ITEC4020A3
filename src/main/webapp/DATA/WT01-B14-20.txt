<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
March 25, 1996</I>


<P>


  While central bank policy is likely to remain passive in the face of a moderate rebound in U.S. output growth, <B>there is a risk that bond yields could be more volatile.</B> The growth of hedge funds and other leveraged investors has given the bond market a far more speculative flavor than the equity market during recent years and thus bond prices often react far more violently to new economic information than other financial assets. In 1996, the U.S. bond market will also have to contend with volatility in the political outlook of investors, not just fluctuations in the business cycle.  

<P>

  On the basis of 30 year bond yields, real long-term interest rates are currently just under 4.0% in the U.S., 5.0% in Britain, and well over 5.0% in France and Germany. The ten-year bonds of Japan yield about 3.0% in real terms while in Switzerland they yield about 3.5%. In late December 1995, by contrast, real and nominal long-term interest rates were about 100 basis points lower in the U.S. and Europe.  

<P>

  The one event still capable of producing a positive bond market surprise in the face of stronger output growth during the second quarter would be a successful U.S. budget compromise. <B>The White House is sufficiently concerned about the large rise in U.S. bond yields since January that is has been putting out feelers to Senator Robert Dole about pursuing a new budget agreement.</B> The White House has long viewed him as a more amenable to a compromise than the House Republican leadership and his success in the Republican primaries has greatly increased his potential freedom of action. But despite the opportunity for new negotiations created by the Dole victory, there are still major hurdles to an agreement. The major case for the Republicans to accept a compromise is that they have fallen sharply in the opinion polls and many voters now perceive their attempt at confrontational budget negotiations to have been a failure. The barriers to a budget agreement are congressional and White House perceptions of the tradeoffs between improving the performance of the economy and achieving no deal. The Republicans fear that a budget agreement could help the president more than them by lowering bond yields and boosting the housing market. The White House fears that any compromise which trims Medicare spending will deny them the opportunity to engage in demagogic attacks on the Republicans in states with large populations of retired people, such as Florida. In short, neither side perceives overwhelming advantages to a deal while both sides perceive potential downside. As a result of these constraints, the odds of a deal will probably remain below 50% unless the economy is so strong during the second quarter that bond yields shoot over 7.0% and equity prices fall sharply. In such a scenario, the president would offer major concessions to obtain a deal.  

<P>

  While most investors are relieved that Senator Robert Dole has won firm control of the Republican nomination and thwarted the challenge posed by Patrick Buchanan, they are not optimistic about his prospects in November. They perceive him to be an older and less dynamic campaigner than the president. They also perceive that a third party candidacy by Ross Perot or Patrick Buchanan will draw votes largely at the expense of Dole. <B>They believe that Dole has a solid base of about 150 electoral votes in the South and West but they do not think that he will be able to carry California or the Great Lakes states unless the economy deteriorates sharply,</B> there is a foreign policy disaster, or the various investigations of the first family's financial affairs in the 'emerging market' state of Arkansas produce a formal indictment of Mrs. Clinton, not just press stories about sleazy business relationships. The special federal prosecutor, Mr. Ken Starr, has indicted the Governor of Arkansas and may obtain new evidence to use against the first family if he can obtain a conviction which encourages other Arkansas politicians to plea bargain at the expense of the president. But as the president has already survived four years of rumors about his personal life and financial affairs in Arkansas, the markets will remain skeptical about his vulnerability without major new disclosures.  

<P>

  While the president is clearly ahead at the present time, <B>there are several factors which could still produce a Dole victory.</B> First, the president received only 43% of the vote in 1992 and thus would have lost if Ross Perot had not taken 19% of the vote largely at the expense of the Republicans. Secondly, as the American president is both head of state and head of government, the issue of character looms large in public perceptions of the office. Senator Dole can campaign as a World War Two veteran who has devoted a lifetime to public service while nearly half of the electorate perceives the president to be a decadent, if not corrupt, member of the most self-indulgent generation in American history (the baby boomers). Thirdly, it is doubtful that Ross Perot will be able to come anywhere close to matching the 19% share of the vote which he received four years ago. In 1992, he was a new face and the opinion polls briefly suggested that he might win the election. In 1996, it is widely accepted that a vote for Ross Perot is ultimately a vote for Bill Clinton. Nor can Perot attract the support of people who voted for Patrick Buchanan because of his clear uncompromising position on abortion. Ross Perot supports the right to abortion, so the pro-life movement has no alternative but to return to the Republican Party. Finally, in contrast to George Bush four years ago, Dole should be able to attract the support of most conservatives because he provides them with an unprecedented opportunity to influence U.S. public policy through Republican control of both the White House and the Congress for the first time since the era of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. The fact that Dole comes from a tradition of political moderation may offend some conservatives but the fact is the American people would probably not support the election of an ultra-conservative President and Congress at the same time. They like the checks and balances which come from dividing power between executive and legislative branches of different political persuasions. In fact, the president himself has effectively co-opted much of the Republicans' rhetoric so that he can campaign as the candidate who will eliminate the budget deficit in a humane way, not through savage cuts in popular middle class entitlement programs. It will be far easier for Senator Dole to portray himself as the president who can achieve his party's agenda without threatening ordinary people than it would have been for some of his party's other candidates.  

<P>

  As a result of these factors, the American presidential race is still wide open. The President's lead should narrow during the next few months but could re-open if the Republicans permit their convention to be dominated by extremist rhetoric or if Patrick Buchanan joins Ross Perot on a third party ticket which captures a large share of the Christian evangelical vote.  

<P>

  The Republicans are aware of these risks, so they should be able to avoid the mistakes which plagued them at the 1992 convention but Senator Dole will still have to demonstrate far more skill at coalition building with his party's right wing populists than was possible for George Bush.
