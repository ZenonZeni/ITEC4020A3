<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Single Premium Life Insurance:  One Payment, Many Benefits</STRONG></FONT><P>

Single Premium Life Insurance can provide the vital financial protection of life insurance and
be an
important source of capital, in a convenient "pay one time" package.
<P>
<STRONG>SPL - A Unique Concept</STRONG><BR>

The Single Premium Life (SPL) Insurance concept is simple and straightforward:  you pay a
single
lump sum ($5,000 or more) for a paid-up, cash value life insurance policy.  SPL can provide
the
financial security that people seek from life insurance, along with an attractive means of
accumulating
funds for retirement or other long-term financial needs.  SPL offers:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A death benefit free from federal income tax (in some states it may also be free
from 	state
death tax, probate expense, and the claims of creditors).
	<LI>A competitive interest rate credited to the policy's cash value.
	<LI>Tax-deferred accumulation of the policy's cash value.
	<LI>The ability to access cash values through policy loans.
	<LI>The convenience of paying just one premium for a paid-up policy.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>"A Souped-Up Annuity"?</STRONG><BR>
No, SPL is not an annuity, even though many industry experts feel that it may be more
appropriate to
compare SPL to annuities than to traditional life insurance.  SPL and single premium
deferred
annuities (SPDA) have many similarities:  a single premium payment, tax-free accumulation
of cash
value, identical tax rules governing loans, and a guaranteed death benefit.  But there are
key
differences.  The death benefit of SPL is usually a good deal larger than that of a
comparable SPDA; in
fact, by tax law, the SPL death benefit must be considerably larger than its cash value.  Also,
in most
instances, the death benefit of the SPL is free from federal income tax, while the
beneficiaries of
annuities incur taxable income on the gain in the contract.
<P>

<STRONG>A Brief History of SPL</STRONG><BR>
In the mid-1980s, insurance companies introduced the innovative SPL policy designed to
maximize
three tax advantages of life insurance:  generally no federal income tax on the death benefit,
tax-deferred
accumulation of cash value, and tax-free borrowing from that cash value.  These
advantages, along with
competitive interest rates on the policy's cash value, made SPL a very popular product with
savvy
consumers.
<P>
In 1988, Congress enacted legislation that affected the tax treatment of some life insurance
policies,
including SPL.  It is now technically classified as a Modified Endowment Contract, which
eliminates the
tax-free loan feature.  Now, when you borrow from an SPL policy, it results in a taxable
distribution.  The
lesser of the loan or gain is reported as a taxable gain.  In addition, the IRS imposes a 10%
penalty tax
on the taxable gain distributed before the policy owner is age 59 1/2.
<P>

<STRONG>To Whom is SPL Best Suited?</STRONG><BR>
While SPL is available to most ages (0 to 85), it can be a key part of the portfolio of mature,
fairly affluent
pre-retirees.  It provides financial security and the potential for 
long-term capital growth.  Under its current tax treatment, SPL may not be the most
appropriate product
for people with a need for current income.  For those seeking tax-free policy loans as a top
priority in a
life insurance product, a traditional permanent policy may be a better choice.  With SPL, it is
best to
restrict borrowing until after age 59 1/2, at which point the penalty tax would not apply.
<P>

<STRONG>The Many Uses of SPL</STRONG><BR>
Providing a degree of financial security for yourself and your family remains a primary
advantage of an
SPL policy.  SPL allows for only a single premium payment and generates an increasing
death benefit. 
Beneficiaries of SPL
proceeds
receive their funds free of federal income tax.  Those funds can be used to pay off mortgages
and other
debts, fund children's or grandchildren's educations, take care of final expenses, offset the
loss of the
insured's income, and allow a family to continue its standard of living.  To the extent
permitted by law,
insurance proceeds are protected from the claims of the insured's creditors.  Below are
other benefits
and uses of an SPL policy:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
<STRONG>A Source of Retirement Income</STRONG> - Tax-deferred cash value
accumulation can be
considerable over the long-term.  You can tap into that cash value through the valuable loan
provision to
help fund a comfortable retirement.  Since most policies will be classified as Modified
Endowment
Contracts, you would be taxed on these loans to the extent of gain in the policy, including
any unpaid
loan interest.  However, loans taken after age 59 1/2 would not be subject to the additional
10% penalty
of the taxable amount.  Outstanding loans are deducted from the death benefit. 
<P>
<STRONG>Gifts to Minors and Adults</STRONG> - A lasting legacy can be left to minor
children and
grandchildren through the gifting of SPL.  There is no gift tax due on SPL policies purchased
on a
child's
life up to $10,000 of single premium.  The children's parents should be made custodial
owners of the
policies.  Parents can also make gifts to adult children.  Using joint gifts or community
property gifts,
parents can purchase SPL policies on each adult child for up to $20,000 with no gift tax
consequences. 
Withdrawals may be subject to a tax penalty if made before age 59 1/2.
<P>
<STRONG>Charitable Giving Uses</STRONG> - Using an SPL policy, you can make a
larger donation
to your favorite charity.  Over the long-term, SPL can multiply your single premium several
times over to
provide a generous donation to a worthwhile cause.  Philanthropic bequests have become
one of the
most meaningful uses of life insurance.  
<P>
<STRONG>Lump-Sum Distribution Vehicle</STRONG> - If there's a substantial lump-sum
distribution
coming your way in the future, you might want to take a look at SPL.  It can be a good place
to put
insurance proceeds, funds from the sale of a residence, an after tax distribution from a
qualified plan,
annual bonuses, or inherited funds.
