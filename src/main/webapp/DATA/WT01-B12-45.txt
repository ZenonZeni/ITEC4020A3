 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FACIAL SKIN </H2>

<P>  Facial skin is the most exposed area on the body. Sunlight, extremes of temperature, blasts of hot and cold air,  environmental  toxins  and  other  offenders  like cigarette smoke insult it every minute of every day. It is never covered.  Yet, this small area of less than nine percent of our total skin surface suffers more than the other ninety one percent.  Also, our skin is stressed by internal factors that arise from internal emotional and metabolic factors.  Think of the phrase "putting on a good face" and understand the meaning of that phrase in terms of emotional stress pumped into our skin. Stress produces adrenalin related products, which not only restrict blood flow to our skin, but also generates potent, destructive free radicals. All of these forces combine to wreck havoc with the texture, color and resiliency of our skin. To help correct these problems with a view toward efficacy and ease of use, and to meet the demands placed on  facial  skin,  FOREVER  YOUNG  FACIAL PERFECTING GEL was developed.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STRENGTHENING AND FIRMING</H2>
<P> The ingredients in FACIAL  PERFECTING GEL include  antioxidants  such  as  Vitamin E  and Anthocyanidins, as well as moisturizers and FOREVER YOUNG marine concentrate. In addition, it includes theophylline conjugated with Algisium Complex. All of these ingredients act to prevent free radical damage, either by quenching the free radicals, stopping a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, or binding iron so that it does not react with the reactive oxygen species to form hydroxyl radicals. The overall action of the ingredients is to strengthen and firm the connective tissues in the dermis, particularly elastin and collagen. Along with the fat  deposits  beneath  the  skin,  these  proteins  are responsible for the shape and tone of the facial skin. Daily use of the product will result in firmer skin that resists wrinkling and sagging.   Sagging is mainly a gravitational effect, while wrinkling is an inflammatory response induced by free radicals. Both of these result from both exogenous (external as in sun exposure or cigarette smoke), or endogenous (internal as in toxic drug intake or alcohol abuse).
  Careful balancing of repair and protection functions in FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL PERFECTING GEL allow the use of several active ingredients that sense the need for repair at particular areas of the face.  The enzymes that replace worn or damaged collagen and elastin are assisted by these ingredients, which then effect the repair.   Critical to this process is the compatibility of the ingredients, not only to work in a synergistic manner with the normal skin physiological processes that maintain the skin in good repair, but also to aid and stimulate these processes as needed by the skin. The end results are the firming of the tissues and laying down of fresh, vibrant tissue that is responsible for the skin's strength and more youthful beauty.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS</H2>
<P>  The  antioxidants  contained   in  FACIAL PERFECTING GEL not only slow down the peroxidation of the lipids, which destroys cells, but actually  protects  many  vital  cellular  functions, particularly the DNA in the cell. The long term benefit from   using   FOREVER YOUNG FACIAL PERFECTING GEL is that there is less tissue damage, fewer abnormal cells and a better protected skin. The net result is that chronic inflammation of the skin, which is associated with aging, is markedly reduced, so that continuing skin damage is averted and skin repair is now possible on a continuing basis. Supplying the skin with antioxidants makes good sense, since the body does not give the skin the best it has to offer. The skin, especially the facial skin, needs antioxidants every bit as much as any part of the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE FACIAL PERFECTING GEL </H2>
<P>After cleansing the face with the <A HREF="mfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>, apply a small amount of FACIAL PERFECTING GEL to the five designated areas of the face. Smooth gently under the eyes, on the forehead and around the cheeks and lips. Do not apply to the lips. Then put a small amount under your chin and spread over the entire front of your neck area down to the collar bone. This will help to tighten and smooth your neck area. Allow the gel to dry completely for 1 to 2 minutes. Your skin  is  now  prepared  to  use  the  <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A>. Men also get the most benefit when they cleanse with <A HREF="mfyem.htm">EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>, but if they prefer to just use the PERFECTING GEL, they can. The best time for them to apply it is immediately after shaving.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: Apply twice a day to all areas of the face. Maximum restructuring results are seen if applied after <A HREF="mfyem.htm">FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</A>.</P>
