<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> A Stabilized Space-Time Formulation of the Navier-Stokes Equations for Moving Domain Problems </p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
A space-time finite element formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations
is presented for the analysis of flows over moving and deforming domains.
The variational equation is based on time discontinuous Galerkin method 
and employs the physical entropy variables. A least-squares operator is 
added to the formulation to improve the stability of the method and 
to account for unresolved internal and boundary layers. In this 
formulation the elements can be oriented in time to accommodate the 
spatial deformations.  If they are oriented along the particle paths,
the method is Lagrangian and if they are held fixed in time, it is Eulerian.
Consequently this formulation is analogous to the arbitrary 
Lagrangian-Eulerian techniques. 
Exploiting the idea of arbitrary orientation in time of the space-time
elements, a novel mesh rezoning technique is proposed.
This technique  adapts the fluid mesh to the moving domain with 
deforming boundaries. The approach is quite general and can be applied
to structured and unstructured meshes.
Numerical results are presented to show the performance of the method.
