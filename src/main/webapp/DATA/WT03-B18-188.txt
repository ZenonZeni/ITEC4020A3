<b>Research Interests</b><p>

Rick, an experimental plasma physicist in the Fusion Energy Research Program at the University of California, San Diego, leads a team of UCSD scientists researching plasma edge and divertor physics in the Doublet III-D tokamak at General Atomics in La Jolla, CA. He specializes in investigation of plasma turbulence and transport using Langmuir probes. A description of this work, suitable for non-plasma physicists, is available on the World Wide Web at: 
<a href="http://fusion.gat.com/DNT/DNT21.htm">
http://fusion.gat.com/DNT/DNT21.htm</a>. Rick has considerable experience working in large international collaborations, including a two-year assignment to the TEXTOR tokamak in Juelich, Germany (1988-89). <br>
<br>
Rick's research interests also include space plasma physics, in particular magnetic reconnection, solar coronal heating, and acceleration of the solar wind. <br>
<br>
Rick is active in employment and career development issues for physicists as a participant in the Young Scientists Network (archives at: 
<a href=" http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/ysn/">
http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/ysn/</a>) and as a steering committee member for the Forum on Careers and Professional Development of the American Physical Society. Rick is interested in the use of on-line technology in job placement and career development, and has contributed to the Careers Plus supplement of APS News (April, 1996) and the Careers Plus WWW site of the American Physical Society (
<a href=" http://aps.org/jobs/careerplus/">http://aps.org/jobs/careerplus/</a>) on this topic.<br>
