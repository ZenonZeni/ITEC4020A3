<P>
The CRC for Quality Wheat Products and Processes, established in July 1995, combines the research strengths of 12 participants to assist the Australian wheat industry develop high-quality wheats. The administrative headquarters are based at the Bread Research Institute in Sydney and projects are being undertaken at 14 different locations.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
A powerful research team is focused on two major programs, one addressing the fundamental issues of wheat quality and the other looking at the practical technological factors that affect the use of wheat for a range of applications. A total of 45 research projects is being conducted.
At the Australian Wheat Board’s Academy of Grain Technology in Melbourne, specialist equipment is being utilised to investigate wheat-based Asian foods. Projects include investigations of instant and long-life noodles and steamed breads. Another project is looking at the energy values of feed wheats in poultry rations.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Collaboration is now taking place in the CRC between institutions which previously had to compete for funds in order to survive. The collective expertise is expected to guarantee successful outcomes.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The wheat industry is one of Australia's major export earners with the annual crop worth $2 billion to $3 billion. An increasing proportion of the crop goes to quality-conscious buyers. The future of the industry will depend on the continued development of high-quality wheat which meet their needs.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The Victorian node of the CRC is based at the Australian Wheat Board, which has its head office in Melbourne. The Board has a huge stake in maintaining its market share in the rapidly expanding markets of Asia. The Asian foods centre has been established at the Academy of Grain Technology to lead the Asian initiative.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The CRC has an extensive education and training program comprising industry training for producers, handlers, marketers and processors; undergraduate tertiary training as part of the course in agricultural science at the University of Sydney; a new Masters degree in grain science by course work and traditional MSc and PhD research projects jointly supervised by the University of Sydney and an industry partner; and international training for full-time overseas students.
The international program builds on training provided by the AWB to its export customers.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
There are ample opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises in the wheat production and processing industries to commission business-specific projects with the various participants.
<P>
