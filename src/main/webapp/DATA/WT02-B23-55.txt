<CENTER><H2>Father, teen son die in
scuba diving accident</H2></CENTER>
	A nationally known scuba diver and his teen-age son died and three other divers required decompression treatment when things went tragically wrong during a shipwreck dive July 2 six miles off San Pedro, California. Found in 145 feet of water by rescue divers from Baywatch and Marina Del Rey Harbor Patrols were the bodies of Darren Douglass, 34, of Glendora, California and his 14-year old son Jeremiah, both of whom had run out of air. Word of the deaths stunned the southern California scuba diving community where Douglass, the father of five, was well known as the managing editor of Dive Boat magazine and a master diving instructor with 20 years of experience. Douglass was also the dive master of the diving vessel Atlantis that had been chartered that day. It was two weeks before a preliminary report of the accident outlined the dramatic events that lead up to the tragedy. <P>
	Douglass had led 12 divers, including his son, to one of the coast's popular advanced dive spots, the sunken World War I Navy destroyer Moody that lies in kelp and sand 145 feet deep six miles off Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro. Given its depth (and therefore the increased risks) the wreck qualifies as a technical dive, with a safe bottom time of only 10-12 minutes.  It was 2 p.m. and the group had made a number of successful dives that day. Since most had used up their bottom time, they prepared to leave. Then things began to go wrong. <P>
	When the Atlantis' captain announced the anchor line had snagged on the wreck and he was prepared to cut it, a majority of the divers, including Douglass and his son, opted to do a quick bounce dive to free the anchor. They swam down the anchor line to free the snag. Darren Douglas began his ascent just before the anchor was freed, and the other divers followed. But, the report states, "the freed anchor line, in the strong current, now presented a difficult, meandering and indirect route for the divers," one of whom was young Douglass who was holding on to it in an attempt to follow it to the surface. A source familiar with the investigation said the boy was wearing only a single air tank instead of two recommended for such dives. <P>
	On his way up to the boat, diver Jeff Highley,32, saw Jeremiah give the out-of-air sign, and swam to him to share his back-up air supply. But the boy, who also seemed to be having buoyancy problems, was unable to overcome the downward force (a Coast Guard source said rescuers noted a small hole in his wetsuit which at that depth could have allowed in a good deal of water). Douglass let go of the anchor line and the back-up regulator and sank. Highley, also virtually out of air, floated to the surface unconscious where the Atlantis' crew quickly brought him aboard and managed to revive him (a Coast Guard helicoptor later medevaced Highley to a hyperbaric chamber on Santa Catalina Island where he was in serious but stable condition). <P>
	When Darren Douglass surface shortly thereafter and realized to his horror that his son had still not appeared, he apparently took the biggest gamble of all and dove beneath the surface. With only 200 psi of air left, he was last seen swimming rapidly down the anchor line to search for his child. He  paid the ultimate price. Los Angeles County Lifeguard Capt. Gary Crum who was one of the rescuers called to the scene told the Los Angeles Times that rescue divers found father and son floating side by side on the sandy bottom, the father's hand outstretched toward the son. "It looked like they were probably touching until the time they passed out and died." <P>
