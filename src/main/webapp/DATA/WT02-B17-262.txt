<H1>Landscaping for Energy Efficiency</H1>


Are you looking for cost-effective yet eye-pleasing ways to lower your energy bills? Planting trees, shrubs, vines,

grasses, and hedges could be the answer. In fact, landscaping may be your best long-term investment for reducing

heating and cooling costs, while also bringing other improvements to your community.<P>


A well-designed landscape will:<P>

      <UL>

<LI>Cut your summer and winter energy costs dramatically.

</UL>

  

    <UL>

<LI>Protect your home from winter wind and summer sun.

</UL>


      <UL>

<LI>Reduce consumption of water, pesticides, and fuel for landscaping and lawn maintenance.

</UL>


     <UL>

<LI>Help control noise and air pollution.

</UL><P>


This publication covers landscaping tips to save money year-round; ways that landscaping helps the environment;

important climate, site, and design considerations; landscape planning; and tree and shrub selection. You can get

additional information on regionally appropriate species from your local nursery and landscaping experts.<BR>

<P>

<H2><B>Landscaping Saves Money Year-Round</B></H2>


Carefully positioned trees can save up to 25% of a household s energy consumption for heating and cooling. Computer

models devised by the U.S. Department of Energy predict that the proper placement of only three trees will save an

average household between $100 and $250 in energy costs annually.<P>


On average, a well-designed landscape provides enough energy savings to return your initial investment in less than 8

years. An 8-foot (2.4-meter) deciduous (leaf-shedding) tree, for example, costs about as much as an awning for one

large window and can ultimately save your household hundreds of dollars in reduced cooling costs, yet still admit some

winter sunshine to reduce heating and lighting costs. Landscaping can save you money in summer or winter.<P>


<I><B>Summer </B> </I><BR>

You may have noticed the coolness of parks and wooded areas compared to the temperature of nearby city streets. Shading

and evapotranspiration (the process by which a plant actively moves and releases water vapor) from trees can reduce

surrounding air temperatures as much as 9 degrees F (5 degrees C). Because cool air settles near the ground, air

temperatures directly under trees can be as much as 25 degrees F (14 degrees C) cooler than air temperatures above

nearby blacktop. Studies by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory found summer daytime air temperatures to be 3 degrees F to

6 degrees F (2 degrees C to 3 degrees C) cooler in tree- shaded neighborhoods than in treeless areas.<P>


A well-planned landscape can reduce an unshaded home's summer air-conditioning costs by 15% to 50%. One Pennsylvania

study reported air-conditioning savings of as much as 75% for small mobile homes.<P> 


<B><I>Winter </I></B><BR>

You may be familiar with wind chill. If the outside temperature is 10 degrees F (-12 degrees C) and the wind speed is

20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour), the wind chill is -24 degrees F (-31 degrees C). Trees, fences, or

geographical features can be used as windbreaks to shield your house from the wind. <P>


A study in South Dakota found that windbreaks to the north, west, and east of houses cut fuel consumption by an average

of 40%. Houses with windbreaks placed only on the windward side (the side from which the wind is coming) averaged 25%

less fuel consumption than similar but unprotected homes. If you live in a windy climate, your well-planned landscape

can reduce your winter heating bills by approximately one-third.<BR>

<P>

<H2>Landscaping for a Cleaner Environment</H2>


Widespread tree planting and climate-appropriate landscaping offer substantial environmental benefits. Trees and

vegetation control erosion, protect water supplies, provide food, create habitat for wildlife, and clean the air by

absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.<P>


The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) estimates that urban America has 100 million potential  tree spaces  (i.e.,

spaces where trees could be planted). NAS further estimates that filling these spaces with trees and lightening the

color of dark, urban surfaces would result in annual energy savings of 50 billion kilowatt-hours -- 25% of the 200

billion kilowatt-hours consumed every year by air conditioners in the United States. This would reduce electric power

plant emissions of carbon dioxide by 35 million tons (32 million metric tons) annually and save users of

utility-supplied electricity $3.5 billion each year (assuming an average of $0.07 per kilowatt-hour).<P>


Also, some species of trees, bushes, and grasses require less water than others. Some species are naturally more

resistant to pests, so they require less pesticides. Another alternative to pesticides is<I> integrated pest

management</I>, an emerging field that uses least-toxic pest control strategies. One example is to introduce certain

insects such as praying mantises or ladybugs to feed on -- and limit populations of -- landscape-consuming pests.<P>


Certain grasses, such as buffalo grass and fescue, only grow to a certain height --  roughly 6 inches (15 centimeters)

and are water thrifty. By using these species, you can eliminate the fuel, water, and time consumption associated with

lawn mowing, watering, and trimming. Also, recent studies have found that gasoline-powered mowers, edge trimmers, and

leaf blowers contribute to air pollution.<BR>

<P>

<H2>Climate, Site, and Design Considerations</H2>

<B><I>Climate </I></B><BR>

The United States can be divided into four approximate climatic regions: temperate, hot-arid, hot-humid, and cool. The

energy-conserving landscape strategies you use should depend on which region you live in. These landscaping strategies

are listed by region and in order of importance below.<P>

</UL>

      <UL>

<LI>Shade south and west windows and walls from the direct summer sun, if summer overheating is a problem.

</UL><BR>

<P>

<B><I>Microclimate </I></B><BR>

The climate immediately surrounding your home is called its microclimate. If your home is located on a sunny southern

slope, it may have a warm microclimate, even if you live in a cool region. Or, even though you live in a hot-humid

region, your home may be situated in a comfortable microclimate because of abundant shade and dry breezes. Nearby

bodies of water may increase your site's humidity or decrease its air temperature.<P>


Your home s microclimate may be more sunny, shady, windy, calm, rainy, snowy, moist, or dry than average local

conditions. These factors all help determine what plants may or may not grow in your microclimate.<P>


<B><I>Siting and Design </I></B><BR>

A well-oriented and well-designed home admits low-angle winter sun, rejects overhead summer sun, and minimizes the

cooling effect of winter winds. If you are building a home, pay attention to its orientation.<P>


In the northern hemisphere, it is usually best to align the home's long axis in an east-west direction. The home's

longest wall with the most window area should face south or southeast. The home's north-facing and west-facing walls

should have fewer windows because these walls generally face winter's prevailing winds. North-facing windows receive

little direct sunlight.<P>


You may be able to design and orient your new house to maximize your homesite's natural advantages and mitigate its

disadvantages. Notice your homesite's exposure to sun, wind, and water. Also note the location and proximity of nearby

buildings, fences, water bodies, trees, and pavement -- and their possible climatic effects. Buildings provide shade

and windbreak. Fences and walls block or channel the wind. Water bodies moderate temperature but increase humidity and

produce glare. Trees provide shade, windbreaks, or wind channels. Pavement reflects or absorbs heat, depending on

whether its color is light or dark.<P>


If your home is already built, inventory its comfort and energy problems, then use the following landscaping ideas to

help minimize these problems.<P>


<B>Shading</B> <BR>

Solar heat passing through windows and being absorbed through the roof is the major reason for air-conditioner use.

Shading is the most cost-effective way to reduce solar heat gain and cut air-conditioning costs. Using shade

effectively requires you to know the size, shape, and location of the moving shadow that your shading device casts.

Remember that homes in cool regions may never overheat and may not require shading.<P>


Trees can be selected with appropriate sizes, densities, and shapes for almost any shading application. To block solar

heat in the summer but let much of it in during the winter, use deciduous trees. To provide continuous shade or to

block heavy winds, use evergreen trees or shrubs.<P>


Deciduous trees with high, spreading crowns (i.e., leaves and branches) can be planted to the south of your home to

provide maximum summertime roof shading. Trees with crowns lower to the ground are more appropriate to the west, where

shade is needed from lower afternoon sun angles. Trees should not be planted on the southern sides of solar- heated

homes in cold climates because the branches of these deciduous trees will block some winter sun.<P>


A 6-foot to 8-foot (1.8-meter to 2.4-meter) deciduous tree planted near your home will begin shading windows the first

year. Depending on the species and the home, the tree will shade the roof in 5 to 10 years. If you have an air

conditioner, be aware that shading the unit can increase its efficiency by as much as 10%.<P>


Trees, shrubs, and groundcover plants can also shade the ground and pavement around the home. This reduces heat

radiation and cools the air before it reaches your home's walls and windows. Use a large bush or row of shrubs to shade

a patio or driveway. Plant a hedge to shade a sidewalk. Build a trellis for climbing vines to shade a patio area.<P>


Vines can shade walls during their first growing season. A lattice or trellis with climbing vines, or a planter box

with trailing vines, shades the home's perimeter while admitting cooling breezes to the shaded area.<P>


Shrubs planted close to the house will fill in rapidly and begin shading walls and windows within a few years. However,

avoid allowing dense foliage to grow immediately next to a home where wetness or continual humidity are problems.

Well-landscaped homes in wet areas allow winds to flow around the home, keeping the home and its surrounding soil

reasonably dry.<P>


<B>Wind Protection</B><BR>

Properly selected and placed landscaping can provide excellent wind protection, which will reduce heating costs

considerably. Furthermore, these benefits will increase as the trees and shrubs mature. The best windbreaks block wind

close to the ground by using trees and shrubs that have low crowns.<P>


Evergreen trees and shrubs planted to the north and northwest of the home are the most common type of windbreak. Trees,

bushes, and shrubs are often planted together to block or impede wind from ground level to the treetops. Or, evergreen

trees combined with a wall, fence, or earth berm (natural or man-made walls or raised areas of soil) can deflect or

lift the wind over the home. Be careful not to plant evergreens too close to your home's south side if you are counting

on warmth from the winter sun.<P>


A windbreak will reduce wind speed for a distance of as much as 30 times the windbreak's height. But for maximum

protection, plant your windbreak at a distance from your home of two to five times the mature height of the trees.<P>


If snow tends to drift in your area, plant low shrubs on the windward side of your windbreak. The shrubs will trap snow

before it blows next to your home.<P>


In addition to more distant windbreaks, planting shrubs, bushes, and vines next to your house creates dead air spaces

that insulate your home in both winter and summer. Plant so there will be at least 1 foot (30 centimeters) of space

between full-grown plants and your home's wall.<P>


Summer winds especially at night can have a cooling effect if used for home ventilation. However, if winds are hot and

your home is air conditioned all summer, you may want to keep summer winds from circulating near your home.<BR>

<P>


<H2>Planning Your Landscape</H2>


Before you start landscaping, you must first develop a plan. The components of your plan could include deciduous trees

and plants, coniferous trees and plants, earth berms, walls, fences, sheds, and garages. This section will help you

create a landscape plan before you plant around your existing home or before you begin construction on a new house.<P>


Use paper and different-colored pencils to begin designing your landscape. First, sketch a simple, scaled drawing of

your yard. Locate its buildings, walks, driveways, and utilities (e.g., sewer, electric, and telephone lines). Note the

location of all paved surfaces -- streets, driveways, patios, or sidewalks -- near your home. Then identify potential

uses for different areas of your yard: vegetable gardens, flower beds, patios, and play areas.<P>


Draw arrows to show sun angles and prevailing winds for both summer and winter. As you sketch, circle the areas of your

yard needing shade or wind protection.<P>


Indicate with arrows how you want views to be preserved or screened. Mark routes of noise pollution you wish to block.

Also, highlight areas where landscaping height or width may be restricted, such as under utility lines or along

sidewalks.<P>


Notice yard areas that suffer from poor drainage and standing water. Some trees and shrubs will not grow well in poorly

drained areas; others will. Note existing trees and shrubs. Plan for their replacement if they are old or sick and if

they provide valued shade or windbreak.<P>


Perhaps you want more defined property boundaries or less traffic noise. Consider a "living fence" of dense trees,

bushes, or shrubs. Depending on its location and application, this hedge can be customized to be tall, short, wide,

narrow, open, or dense. Privet is a species of shrub that grows in most parts of the United States and can serve as a

living fence.<P>


Areas of lawn not used as picnic or play areas can be converted to planting beds or <I>xeriscaped</I> areas.

Xeriscaping is a landscaping technique that uses vegetation that is drought resistant and is able to survive on

rainfall and groundwater once established. Converting a traditional lawn to alternative, water-conserving grasses or

other forms of xeriscaping saves energy and reduces water consumption.<P>


Perhaps you live in an urban area where yards are small and neighbors close. Your neighbor's yard may be the best place

for trees to shade your south-facing windows. Your yard may be the best location for their windbreak. Bringing your

neighbors into your plans could benefit everyone involved.<P>


The more you identify your goals and familiarize yourself with your yard's features -- current and proposed -- the

better your chances for success with your landscaping projects.<BR>

<P>


<H2>Selecting and Planting Trees and Shrubs</H2>


Trees and shrubs come in all shapes and sizes. How you select your trees and shrubs and how you<A HREF="landlink.html">

plant</A> them will directly affect your home's comfort and energy efficiency.<P>


Trees and shrubs have a life span of many years and can become more attractive and functional with age. But poor

planning of landscape improvements often creates trouble. Ensure proper plant placement and minimal maintenance<I>

before</I> you plant!<P> 


<I><B>Shape Characteristics </B></I><BR>

Tree shapes are very diverse think of the difference in shape between an oak and a spruce. The "Shading" section under

"Climate, Site, and Design Considerations" above discusses how to use varying tree and shrub characteristics to maximum

advantage when landscaping.<P>


The density of a tree's leaves or needles is important to consider. Dense evergreens, like spruces, make great wind-

breaks for winter winds. If you are just looking to impede summer winds, choose a tree or shrub with more open branches

and leaves. Such trees are also good for filtering morning sun from the east, while denser trees are better for

blocking harsh afternoon summer sun.<P>


<I><B>Growth </B></I><BR>

Should you plant slow-growing or fast-growing tree species? Although a slow-growing tree may require many years of

growth before it shades your roof, it will generally live longer than a fast-growing tree. Also, because slow-growing

trees often have deeper roots and stronger branches, they are less prone to breakage by windstorms or heavy snow loads.

And they can be more drought resistant than fast-growing trees.<P>


Consider growth rate, strength, and brittleness when locating trees near walkways or structures. Ask whether the mature

tree s root system is likely to damage sidewalks, foundations, or sewer lines. The smaller your yard, the more

important it is to select a tree with manageable roots.<P>


<I><B>Selecting, Final Planning, and Purchasing</B></I><BR> 

Landscape professionals can help you choose and locate new trees, shrubs, or ground cover. Share your drawings and

tentative ideas with your local nursery or landscape contractor. As long as you have defined intended uses and spaces

in which planting is actually possible, a competent nursery or landscape specialist will be able to help you make

decisions.<P>


When planting trees, shrubs, hedges, or bushes, find out how large the mature specimen will grow. In all cases,

determine spacing by the <I>mature</I> sizes. For those plants close to your house, plan for at least 1 foot (30

centimeters) of extra clearance between the full-grown shrub and the wall of the home. This will prevent heavy pruning

or damage to home siding in the future.<P>


After considering the placement of your trees and consulting landscaping and nursery professionals, go back to your

drawings or plans and add the new information on species, shape, and mature-size spacing. This provides a final,

prepurchase review to make sure that all elements will work well together -- in the short <I>and</I> long term.<P>


When you are ready to purchase your trees and shrubs, avoid buying damaged specimens. Thoroughly inspect the bark,

limbs, and roots to make sure the plant was handled carefully during growing, digging, and shipping. Reject plant stock

with signs of insects or disease (cocoons, egg masses, cankers, or lesions).<P>


After you purchase the plants, be sure to keep tiny root hairs damp and shaded at all times. The plants will not

survive if these root hairs are allowed to dry before planting.<P>


Contact your county extension agents, public libraries, local nurseries, landscape architects, landscape contractors,

and state and local energy offices for additional information on regionally appropriate plants and their maintenance

requirements.<BR>
