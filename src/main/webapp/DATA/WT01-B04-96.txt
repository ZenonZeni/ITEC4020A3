<p>
The Silverbank is the largest mating and calving ground for the North Atlantic
humpback whale. From January to March of each year, approximately three to five
thousand Atlantic humpbacks migrate to the Silverbank from as far away as Nova
Scotia, to birth and train their young. This area, which is north of the
Dominican Republic, is only one of a few areas where this activity happens each year,
and to swim with these mothers and calves while being escorted by many bulls is an
experience like no other a swimmer has ever witnessed.
<p>
The humpback is the most active of whales on the surface, and at this time
of year the action gets even more incredible. As you watch males compete for females,
you will see them finslapping and lobtailing. When you watch 50 ton male
leviathans as they breach completely out of the water and ram into each
other with incredible force, totally ignoring their surroundings, it is a sight that
humbles even the hard-core naturalists, and sets everybody's heart pounding.                 .
<p>
A whale expert will be present on every trip and during the night we will share
with you personal experiences with lectures, slide shows and hopefully videos
taken during the day. During the day we observe the whales from the comfort of
our large, stable skiffs. At the Silverbank, we don't only see the whales,
we also hear them. The humpback whale is famous for its haunting song, and during
mating season it is ever present. With our hydrophones you will be able to
listen in on every word, as we interpret it for you. The skiffs are provided with a
cover to protect you from the sun, and have a special area for protecting the camera
equipment. The skiffs also have bran-new, silent and fumeless engines in
order not to disturb the whales, since we are there solely to enjoy the splendor of
the whales, not to intrude on them. This is the experience of a lifetime you don't want
to miss.
