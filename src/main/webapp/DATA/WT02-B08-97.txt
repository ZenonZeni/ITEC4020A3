<P>The College of Engineering Robotics and Automation Laboratory was established by Professor Mark W. Spong in January, 1987,  as the Department of General Engineering Robotics Laboratory. Initial support was provided by General Motors Corporation, Zenith Corporation, the <A HREF=../>Department of General Engineering</A> and the 
<A HREF=http://www.engr.uiuc.edu/>
College of Engineering</A>.   

<P>In 1992-1994 the laboratory received a major upgrade with the help of a grant from the National Science Foundation Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program.   Subsequently, the laboratory was merged with the <A HREF=http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/>
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering </A>Robotics Laboratory as part of an effort to establish interdisciplinary, college wide laboratory facilities.  The current name of the laboratory reflects its broader mission.


<P>The laboratory is used by a number of classes including:
