The major risk now confronting the U.S. financial markets is that bond yields will rise sharply in response to both evidence of economic recovery and the increasingly populist tone of the 1996 election campaign.  <B>Most forecasters have clearly underestimated the U.S. economy's resilience while congressional Republicans are so alarmed about their low standing in the opinion polls that they have decided to counter-attack by proposing an immediate reduction in the gasoline tax</B>.  If the bidding war in Washington continues to escalate, investors will become concerned about expansion of the federal deficit and enactment of new regulatory entitlements, such as a higher minimum wage, at a time when the demand for labor is already starting to encourage faster wage growth.
<P>

The overall cyclical condition of the U.S. economy is the best since the 1960's, but there is widespread dissatisfaction with perceived changes in the composition of national income.  The profit share of GDP is still well below its peak in the 1950's and 1960's, but  many people believe that the post-1991 economic expansion has benefited only a small elite of senior executives and stockholders, not the great mass of the American people.  As a result the U.S. economy will be caught between two colliding forces this summer; a bond market which distrusts output growth in excess of 2.0% and a bidding competition in Washington to redistribute income at the expense of corporate profits and the federal deficit.
<P>

Since perceptions are reality in both the bond market and politics, bond investors must now confront a perplexing dilemma.  
<P>

If they start to discount a robust economy and Democratic takeover of  the Congress, bond yields will rise so sharply that the economy could stall this autumn and help set the stage for a Dole victory.  In such a scenario, bond yields could drop from 8.0% this summer back to 5.5% next year.  If, by contrast, bond yields peak close to 7.0% or soon decline, the economy will lose momentum only gradually and the odds of  Democratic victories in November will improve.  If the Democrats regain control of the Congress, bond yields will remain in the 6.5-7.5% range in late 1996 even if output growth slows to 1.5-2.0%.
<P>

Election campaigns always encourage politicians to make promises about the economy which they regret later, <B>but the stakes in the 1996 election are unprecedented in the modern era</B>.  No Democratic President has won two consecutive election victories since Franklin Roosevelt.  The Republicans have not controlled the Congress for two consecutive terms, since the days of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.  As a result, both parties perceive great opportunities and risks in the current election.  The President has done a masterful job of borrowing much of the Republican rhetoric about reducing the size of government while playing upon the theme of economic insecurity through populist proposals, such as boosting the minimum wage.  As is apparent with his stands on Tort Reform and the balanced budget, <B>he is remarkably adept at shifting between the imagery of a New Democrat and an Old Democrat on an issue-by-issue basis</B>.  In fact, a recent media search by The New York Times found that President Clinton did not refer to the minimum wage once when his party controlled the Congress, but he has endorsed a minimum wage hike nearly fifty times since the Republicans took over the Congress in early 1995.
<P>

The minimum wage has fallen so sharply in real terms since the 1980's that an increase will pose only modest risks for employment creation, but the markets regard it as a bad omen of the policies which could follow in 1997 if the Democrats win back control of the Congress.  As a result, it is not surprising that Dr. Al Wojinlower refers to the current American economic scene as one of "glum prosperity".
<P>

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.8% annual rate during the first quarter compared to wide-spread expectations that output growth would be only 1.5-2.0%.  Domestic final sales rose at a 4.1% annual rate compared to 0.6% during the fourth quarter of 1995, 2.6% during the third quarter, and 2.2% during the second quarter.  The uptick in domestic final sales was led by a 14.5% growth rate in business spending on new equipment, 5.8% growth in business spending on structures, and 3.5% growth in consumer spending.  After falling steadily for several quarters, federal government spending also rebounded at a 6.7% annual rate compared to a 12.8% decline during the fourth quarter.  As a result of auto inventory liquidation, non-farm business inventories grew at only a $12.8 billion annual rate compared to $19.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 1995, $36 billion during the middle quarters of 1995, and $54.5 billion during the first quarter of 1995.  If we exclude autos, though, real business inventories rose at a $36.9 billion annual rate last quarter compared to $19.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 1995 and $44.5 billion during the third quarter.
<P>

<B>The underlying strength of domestic final demand suggests that the economy should continue to expand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate through the middle quarters of 1996</B>.  There will be renewed weakness in federal spending during the second quarter and inventory rebuilding will boost the trade deficit, but steady growth of private final demand, coupled with a swing in the corporate inventory cycle, should still produce output growth in excess of 3.0%.
<P>

The best confirmation that the inventory cycle has turned is the purchasing agent index.  It rose back over 50 in April, or its highest level since June, 1995, in response to stronger orders, output, and backlogs.  The April employment report was weak after hefty job gains during the first quarter, but some of this weakness appears to reflect seasonal problems with the timing of the survey.  The April Conference Board survey of consumer perceptions of the job market was much more upbeat.  Only 21.3% of households reported that jobs were hard to get compared to 26.5% during March and 23.4% during February.
<P>

<B>The economy's surprising resilience during the first quarter has already provoked a new debate about when the Fed might feel compelled to tighten monetary policy again</B>.  It is doubtful that the Fed will want to move as early as its late May meeting, but some analysts are now speculating about a rate hike in July or one year after the Fed first began easing policy in response to the 1995 slowdown.
<P>

There is no consensus at the Fed about when to act because there are as many divisions about the economic outlook on the FOMC as there are in the private sector.  Some governors perceive that the economy is structurally vulnerable to weakness because of the high level of consumer debt, while the majority perceive that the economy is expanding at a moderate non-inflationary rate.  They will not want to tighten until they see clear signs that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and push utilization rates to levels which might encourage higher inflation.
<P>

The evidence on the inflation outlook itself is mixed.  There have been large price increases for food and fuel during recent weeks because of exogenous shocks, such as poor weather and low inventories.  Such price shocks are occurring independently of the global business cycle, but they could alter the inflation outlook if they began to influence corporate price and wage behavior.
<P>

Traditional cyclical measures of inflation pressure, such as the purchasing agent price index, are still subdued, but if the output growth remains close to 3.0% they are bound to revive in the near future.  The first quarter employment cost index report also contained the first hints of wage escalation in the U.S. economy.  Wages and salaries in the private sector rose at a 3.3% annual rate compared to gains of only 2.8-2.9% during the previous four quarters.  The uptick in wages was partly offset by slower growth of benefits after a long period in which benefit costs exceeded wage gains.  <B>But with the unemployment rate at 5.4%, the risk is high that wages will continue to escalate because of business competition for labor</B>.
<P>

As a result of  the low level of surplus capacity in the U.S. economy, there is clearly a case for monetary tightening as early as the July FOMC meeting, but there will not be a consensus on the FOMC for action without evidence that output growth will be sustained at a level above 2.5% and that industrial commodity prices are rising.  If the purchasing agent price index shoots up to 50% or higher during the next two months, and the Blue Chip Survey of the economic consensus projects a new median forecast of 3.0-3.5% output growth through the second half, the Fed is virtually certain to hike money market yields 25 basis points in July.  But if the purchasing agent price index is still in the 40-45 range and forecasters remain ambiguous about the growth outlook, the Fed could defer a decision until later in the summer.
