<A HREF="CoopRef#John92"><B>Johnson et al.</B> (1992)</A>: Cooperative Learning is the instructional use of small groups so that students work together to maximize their own and each other's learning. For CL to occur, the professor must carefully structure learning groups. There is a crucial difference between simply putting students in groups to learn and in structuring cooperation among the students. To be cooperative a group must have clear positive interdependence, members must promote each other's learning and success face to face, hold each other personally and individually accountable to do his or her fair share of the work, use appropriately the interpersonal and small-group skills needed for cooperative efforts to be successful, and process as a group how effectively members are working together.<BR>

<A HREF="CoopRef#Bryant"><B>Bryant and Rivera</B> (1995)</A>: Cooperative Learning is defined as sharing the benefits of working collectively to gain knowledge or skill through study and experience. Each student engaged in CL benefits from working as a team, not only by developing academic, communication, and social skills but by receiving credit for the work of the group as a whole. A primary concern with CL is team members working toward a single purpose, as it may be the case of the completion of an assignment. Acquiring academic knowledge is but one aim of CL. CL affords an excellent opportunity to develop interpersonal skills (e.g., turn-taking, collaborating, etc.), to increase overall communicative competence, particularly those associated with language content and form, practicing newly acquired language skills. Each student is actively engaged in the learning process by studying together (i.e., collectively exploring the nature of the content and using their experiences (i.e., prior knowledge) to arrive to a common goal. Each participant is an active, rather than a passive, learner. Each member experiences learning, and all members contribute to the effort by calling upon their experiences and strengths. To sum up: CL is an instructional approach that involves active participation by a heterogeneous group of students toward common goals.<BR>

<A HREF="CoopRef#Brody"><B>Brody</B> (1995)</A>: Cooperative learning evolved primarily in K-12 schools, but there are active networks of teachers in all fields and institutions of higher education who apply the research and theory of cooperative learning in their settings. Cooperative learning is a system of team learning that structures group work in a such a way that it promotes both academic and social outcomes. The emphasis is on teacher's role in classroom management, and establishing and assessing social as well as academic goals. the practice of cooperative learning accounts for ways to structure a productive and positive interdependence among students while holding their individual accountable for the outcomes. It has generally been a management and instructional tool to assist teachers in troubleshooting problems and conducting more effective, achievement-oriented group work.<BR>
