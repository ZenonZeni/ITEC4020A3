Dear Mr. Lutts:
<P>
This is the kind of letter I prefer to write -- and the kind I'm sure you receive often! (Have you guessed already that I am another happy subscriber to your stock advisory?)
You've seen the brochures from those "experts" that I now classify as "all the others", blatantly announcing that X's newsletter is the best, and reciting endless testimonials from a few mysterious (ever try to contact any of them?) subscribers stating that they've... "tried them all, but (X's) is the best!"
<P>
Well, Mr. Lutts, I really have tried all of the better ones -- and while I admit that I'm sometimes difficult to please, not one of those other letters can hold a candle to yours. Not one. Period.
<P>
Before I invested one cent in your stock choices, I read your advisory for a full year. I watched the market very closely, and compared your findings to daily movements. At the end of that year it was obvious that your indicators were absolutely 100% on target, 100% of the time, and that your recommendations were by far the most accurate of any available. Only then did I begin investing based on your suggestions. And I have not been disappointed, not once. Your service really is a service. I especially like the RP line and the Two Second Timer. And because I have found that basing one's investments on flimsy advice in today's market is both dumb and unnecessary, I am a subscriber for life. Please keep up your great work!
Very truly yours,
<P>
