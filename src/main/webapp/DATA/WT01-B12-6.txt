        Obesity is probably the most common chronic disease in
        our country. &quot;Obesity used to be viewed as a lack of
        willpower in a patient&#133; It was not viewed as a
        medical problem. Today I think it is,&quot; says Douglas
        Greene, a University of Michigan endocrinologist who
        heads an FDA committee of outside experts that studies
        new obesity drugs. Excess body fat increases the risk of
        hypertension, coronary artery disease,
        non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, <img
        src="images/beeker2.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
        width="200" height="290"></font><font size="3">hypercholesterolemia,
        lower back pain, esophageal reflux, gallbladder disease,
        sleep apnea, gout, and certain types of cancer (e.g.
        prostate cancer). Patients with these medical conditions
        would benefit from a successful weight loss program.<br>
        Proper food choices (limiting fat) and regular aerobic
        exercises are preferable to calorie restriction as a
        method of weight loss, yet this approach is futile for
        the majority of people, two-thirds of whom regain all
        their lost weight after five years. In a letter to JAMA
        (1993; 270: 1423), Robert Yaes wrote, &quot;Certainly, at
        a time when it is fashionable to claim that alcoholism an
        d drug abuse are illnesses, whose treatment should be
        covered by health insurance, it is inconsistent to blame
        fat people for their own condition&#133; The majority of
        patients who enter weight-control programs do so because
        of concerns about their physical attractiveness, not
        their health. This perception could partially explain why
        so few physicians and so many charlatans are involved in
        the treatment of obesity.&quot; We would like to see this
        trend reversed. Outcome based weight management programs
        could eliminate the cause of many diseases, as opposed to
        treating the symptoms.<br>
        It is increasingly recognized that obesity is not a
        failure of will or behavior, nor is it a disorder of body
        weight regulation. It is a chronic medical condition.
        Research suggests that drug therapy may play an important
        role in long-term management. Robert Weintraub (see the
        &quot;Rx Capsules&quot; at the end of this editorial) has
        pointed out that if obesity is a chronic medical
        conditions in the same way that hypertension is, then
        weight gain following drug discontinuation is no
        different from blood pressure elevation after stopping
        antihypertensive medications.<br>
        In the 1970&#146;s, clinical investigators Richard and
        Judith Wurtman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
        had already implicated serotonin in eating disturbances.
        They theorized that dietary starch is converted to sugar;
        sugar stimulates the pancreas to release insulin; insulin
        raise tryptophan ( a precursor of serotonin) levels in
        the brain; serotonin regulates mood. In studies with
        obese women, Wurtman et al. Found that a
        high-carbohydrate snack improved mood. In support of this
        theory, weight loss is one of the side effects noted with
        the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetinbe (Prozac).
        Boosting serotonin seems to reduce carbohydrate craving
        and helps patients feel &quot;full.&quot; If mood swings
        are eliminated, perhaps behavior modification can be more
        effective. <br>
        Dean Ornish, a California doctor leading a crusade to
        treat heart disease through diet and lifestyle change,
        disputes the premise that a serotonin imbalance is at the
        root of obesity. His clinical work suggests that a diet
        with only 10% of calories form fat is extremely effective
        in losing weight and keeping it off.<br>
        In patients for whom nutritional therapy has not worked,
        the physician may want to consider customized drug
        therapy. As pharmacists, we feel that it is important for
        physicians to have control over their patients&#146;
        therapy. Through the use of professional compounding, we
        can work with you to individualize each patients&#146;
        therapy and maximize the therapeutic benefit. Please call
        for more information. &quot;We help doctors to solve
        medicaiton problems.&quot; - </font>Patty Story - Editor

        Weintraub et al. at the University of Rochester studied
        the effects of phentermine 15mg/day plus fenfluramine
        60mg/day (versus placebo) in 121 patients who weighed
        120% to 180% of their &quot;ideal weight.&quot; After 34
        weeks of drug or placebo therapy, along with calorie
        restriction, behavior modification, and exercise,
        patients in the treated group had lost an average of
        15.9% of initial weight, compared with an average loss of
        5.9% in the placebo group. Of significance is that those
        who continued in the study were able to maintain weight
        loss for three years. (Clin Pharmacol Ther. May 1992;

        is a chronic disease that requires lifelong management.
        Drug treatment can play an important role in any
        management strategy, and combination therapy with two
        anoretic drugs may be the best approach. Combining two
        anorectics permits reducing the dose of both agents,
        which reduces adverse effects.&quot; Side effects of
        stimulation from phentermine and sedation from
        fenfluramine can be offset with combination therapy.<br>

        I first became aware of the use of transdermal NSAIDs
        when working with physicians who were treating pain of
        various origins. The physicians had found that patients
        with long-term chronic pain, including myofacial pain,
        had extraordinary response to topical non-steroidals
        prepared by a compounding pharmacist. Pain at multiple
        trigger points responded extremely well to a combination
        of ketoprofen and capsalcin.<br>
        When using this therapy for industrial injury patients
        and in those chronic back pain, I have experienced no
        failures. The typical starting dose of topical ketoprofen
        10% PLO (pluronic organic lecithin) gel is 1 cc applied
        to the affected area every six hours. The dosage is
        titrated to patient response. Ketoprofen PLO gel has been
        very helpful and I am extremely enthusiastic about
        it&#146;s potential with other patients.<br>
        A definite advantage of topical therapy is area-specific
        targeting of the active ingredient to obtain high tissue
        levels. Topical absorption means a lack of GI side
        effects. Also, low or undetectable blood levels avoid the
        need for dosage adjustment and the potential for problems
        with hepatic and renal impairment.<br>
        Editor&#146;s note: Please see the abstract in our
        previous edition regarding transdermal drug transport.
        Proper preparation of this gel involves significant
        physical agitation in order to increase micelle formation
        and ensure efficacy. (Micelles are spaghetti-like
        structures that produce a macroscopic viscosity,
        increasing the transdermal penetration of the gel.)
        Appropriate agitation requires the use of an ointment
        mill or other homogenization process which we use in our
        compounding laboratory.<br>
