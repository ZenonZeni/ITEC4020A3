CLT CONFIRMS INTENTION TO JOIN CANALSATELLITE

Canal Plus' digital DTH company Canalsatellite is being valued in
preparation for the entry of la Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT) as a shareholder (C&SE Vol.12 No.24). "We are
currently in negotiation with Canal Plus about joining the capital of
Canalsatellite," confirmed Geneviave Yver, senior manager at CLT's
digital arm, Club RTL. "However the value of Canalsatellite has to be
first established, as we do not think it is worth the amount cited by
Canal Plus, of around Fr4 billion (#526m)."

According to Patrick Jousseaume, media analyst at stockbroker Ferri,
Canalsatellite was valued at Fr1 billion when it launched as an
analogue service in November 1992 and should now be worth Fr2-3
billion. If CLT were to take a 25% stake, as has been suggested, it
would correspond to between Fr500 and Fr750 million. Canalsatellite's
ownership would then stand as follows: Canal Plus (52.5%); CLT (25%);
Compagnie Generale des Eaux (15%); Chargeurs (7.5%). Canalsatellite is
currently owned by Canal Plus (70%), CGE (20%) and Chargeurs (10%).

Several factors have pushed CLT to change its strategy. First, the
investment needed to launch its own French-speaking digital bouquet of
25 thematic channels was estimated at around Fr5 billion compared with
Fr400 million invested by Canal Plus in Canalsatellite. CLT has not
halted its own digital plans so far, revealed Yver. "Until a final
agreement on CLT joining Canalsatellite is reached, we will continue
working on our own bouquet. We intend to be an active partner in
Canalsatellite and bring our knowledge in marketing and programmes."

For the deal to go-ahead, all shareholders (Canal Plus, CGE, Chargeurs,
CLT) have to agree, said a source at Canal Plus. An agreement before
the launch of Canalsatellite planned at the end of the first quarter of
1996 is preferred, but the shareholders do not outrule the discussions
continuing.

For Havas, the common shareholder in CLT and Canal Plus,  CLT joining
Canalsatellite would resolve Havas' concern over the two companies
launching two competing bouquets. Anne Brucy, Havas senior manager,
said, "We are glad that things are developing as they are. We always
expected that only one bouquet would be launched."

CLT also faces difficulties on the German market where a recent article
in German magazine Der Spiegel claimed that Bertelsmann was close to a
take- over of CLT.

The German story was flatly denied the next day (December 27) by the
Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Junker, however, who claimed he
had "the personal assurance" from CLT's Belgian shareholder Albert
Frare that he was not to sell his stake in the company.

Junker did confirm that CLT is negotiating taking a 25% stake in Canal
Plus digital bouquet Canalsatellite. CLT has long been battling with co-
shareholder Bertelsmann over control of German TV station RTL.
Bertelsmann which controls 48.1% of the capital wants to buy out the 2%
owned by Burda to reach 50.1% of RTL capital.

This delicate position of the CLT in France and in Germany goes some
way towards justifying the rumours about the sale of CLT to a
conglomerate composed of Bertelsmann/Canal Plus/Havas.

Industry observers suggest CLT may now take the option of opening up
its capital (Fr16 billion or #2bn) - to foreign partners like Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp, Disney, Viacom or Time Warner, to ward off
Bertelsmann and Canal Plus.

UK GOLD, VIDEOTRON CLASH OVER PACKAGING

Failed year-long negotiations have resulted in UK Gold instructing
Videotron to stop distributing the channel to its London and Hampshire
franchises from February 12, a move described by Benjamin Ball, head of
programming at Videotron, as "a strong-arm negotiating tactic."

The crux is Videotron's refusal to carry UK Gold on its lowest
retention tier of five channels called Option 1, (to which channels can
be added a la carte). Gold is carried in a 10-channel tier called
Standard Pack - Videotron's 'big basic' is called Super Pack.

Videotron claims that UK Gold is asking for #0.10 per subscriber more
than any other cable operator because it wants flexibility of
packaging, and is bundling UK Gold with UK Living, making it uneconomic
to carry UK Gold alone.

Bruce Steinberg, chief executive of UK Gold, told C&SE, "It's nothing
to do with UK Living. We offer them the same single channel deal as to
the rest of the industry. We believe that UK Gold should go to the most
widely distributed package, not in the second tier. Videotron
distributes UK Gold as an o la carte channel against our wishes. We
have offered deals on lower than 95% penetration, but there's a price.
They can keep their tiered structure and even a la carte, but they will
have to pay a tiered price. We are buying top quality content and it's
expensive. We need realistic penetration rates to sell. We won't
jeopardise 98% of our business for 2%, giving preferential terms."

UK Gold is received by 87% of Videotron subscribers, the remainder
could do so for #1 as an a la carte channel, or #3 pcm for the next
tier. Unconfirmed industry estimates put the current price per
subscriber for UK Gold at around #0.28 and #0.38, with current
invoicing to Videotron around #0.45.

Videotron says it is resisting attempts by UK Gold to impose
contractual conditions that do not give its customers a flexible low-
cost cable TV service. Steinberg countered, "Videotron goes on about
how much better its packaging is, but its penetration levels are the
same as the rest of the industry - 21%. As Option 1 only has a couple
of channels, the terrestrial channels and their interactive services,
their penetration rate is actually a lot lower. Let them make their
interactive services a la carte."

Videotron responds that it has one of the lowest churn rates in the
industry and is building penetration by removing the financial barrier
to entry. Videotron intends to continue negotiations with UK Gold,
which is also hopeful the dispute will be resolved.

ASTRA 1E BEGINS DIGITAL BROADCAST

The first digital services have been switched on to the newly-
commissioned Astra 1E. However, the lack of available receivers means
that the services are only being viewed by a select few.

The first two channels to be switched on were the German national
public broadcasters ARD and ZDF (Transponder 71). Since December 31 the
clear MPEG-2 transmissions have been broadcast direct from SES in
Luxembourg after being converted from the analogue format.

The French Canalsatellite package is using transponders 66 and 70; the
transmissions had previously been made from Astra 1D, which also
operates in the Astra 1E band. The number of channels included in the
multiplex package continues to vary.

Nethold is using transponders 77 and 80 for its test transmissions from
its digital centre in Hilversum. Again, the number of programmes
included is regularly varied, but will include channels in
MultiChoice's Scandinavian package.

MultiChoice premium channel FilmNet was rebranded from January 1. Astra
channel FilmNet Plus became FilmNet 1 while the Thor-delivered FilmNet:
The Complete Movie Channel is now titled FilmNet 2.

REWE BUYS INTO PRO 7

Germany's largest food retailing group Rewe entered the media business
last week with the purchase of a 40% stake in commercial TV station Pro
7, set up by Thomas Kirch and Pro 7 chairman Georg Kopfler in 1989.
Rewe is thought to have paid around DM60 million (#27m) for the shares,
which it bought off the two Munich banks BFH Bank and Bayerische
Hypotheken (which held 75% of the shares). The two banks are now left
with a 35.5% share in Pro 7, while Kirch still holds 24.5%.

ORBIT INTO EUROPE

Orbit has booked three transponders on Intelsat 702 to allow small-dish
reception of its digital DTH pay-package across western Europe and
North Africa. The new capacity, which will fire up early in 1996, will
enable viewers from London to Algiers to access its channels via 80cm
dishes, giving the same level of service as provided to Middle Eastern
territories via Intelsat 704.

The three transponders will enable Orbit to offer its full 30-plus TV
and radio channels, though in Europe access is likely to be restricted
to those (chiefly Arabic-language) channels for which Orbit holds
rights outside the Middle East region.

AFCO BACKS ARABS

For the first time, the French cable operators' association AFCO has
demanded the authorisation to carry North African channels (C&SE Vol.12
No.23). Until now, this kind of demand has been made by individual
operators and didn't succeed. Under the umbrella of AFCO, the cable
operators now stand more chance of success. During the December meeting
in Cotonou (Benin, Africa), the head of French regulatory body, CSA,
Herve Bourges, asked the French president of the Republic, Jacques
Chirac, to allow the CSA to sign agreements with Arabic channels. AFCO
argues that cable should receive the same treatment as satellite which
is allowed to broadcast Arabic-speaking channels without regulation.

KIRCH REACHES COMPROMISE WITH MMBG

Seemingly defeated in the digital decoder war in Germany, Leo Kirch has
swallowed his pride and signed up to the Multi-media
Betriebsgesellschaft, the consortium of Deutsche Telekom, Canal Plus,
CLT, German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF and private broadcaster RTL
set up to develop an open, unified decoder system for Germany. Seca
(the joint company formed by Bertelsmann and Canal Plus) and Kirch's
technical arm, BetaTechnik, are now forming a joint company to develop
a standardised digital decoder and conditional access system for the
German market.

"There are still questions to be answered such as distribution,
technical details and the exact shareholder structure," said Kirch
spokesman Johannes Schmitz. "It's a new situation for us. Both sides
could have blocked each other, so we decided to join the MMBG and work
on a common decoder system."

After Deutsche Telekom's decision to opt for the MMBG's Mediabox
decoder technology, dismissing Kirch's "offer" on the grounds that
insufficient technical information on the decoder and conditional
access system was submitted and Telekom's tender protocol was not
adhered to (C&SE Vol.12, No.24), Kirch's position looked very
uncertain.

Without Deutsche Telekom, Kirch did not have the 16 million German
cable homes, key to the digital developments in Germany and was left
with an order for one million Nokia decoders - it is still unclear what
will become of this order. "The order stands firm. The decoders can be
used in other markets [such as Scandinavia]," offered Schmitz. The
decision by Kirch to join the MMBG has been welcomed by the members of
the consortium, for it prevents the situation which the MMBG wanted to
avoid all along - having two competing decoder systems in the German
market - which could only serve to fragment the market and confuse the
consumer.

Kirch is reportedly to take an 8.8% stake in MMBG, along with
Bertelsmann, CLT and ARD/ZDF, while Canal Plus and RTL are expected to
hold a 4.4% stake. Kirch reportedly demanded an 11% share along with
Bertelsmann, but was blocked by the other MMBG members who refused to
let Kirch muscle in at the last moment and steal the show.

5% will be held by broadcasters including the oRF and the SRG and the
Bauer publishing house. Deutsche Telekom and cable operator Vebacom
will hold the remaining 51% share. Further cable operators are expected
to join the Telekom/Vebacom stake.

The German cartel authorities have initially agreed to the new
constellation of the MMBG. Their wish for as many service providers and
service carriers as possible to be included in the consortium now
seemingly fulfilled. The MMBG still has to be approved by the EC,
while, the German media authorities are concerned that the decoder
system is as open and non-discriminatory as the MMBG claims it will be.

Kirch's compromise with the MMBG is also good news for Germany's only
pay-TV channel, Premiere, which is to play a vital role in the launch
of digital television. Premiere had been caught in the middle of the
MMBG versus Kirch digital decoder fray - its main shareholders being
Canal Plus, Bertelsmann and Kirch. A common decoder system will now be
able to be offered to the channel's one million subscribers.

OVER 300 GET THE AXE IN NYNEX RESTRUCTURE

Nynex CableComms, the UK's second largest cable company, is cutting its
workforce by 310 employees - including a 20% cut at executive director
level - as part of a major restructuring forecast to reduce overheads
by #7 million to #10 million per year.

"Nynex came out very low in an efficiency comparison with other cable
operators published last October by Goldman Sachs. The restructuring
was entirely forecastable," commented Neil Blackley, media analyst at
Goldman Sachs.

Despite the improved cost/revenue balance, and the positive
presentation of the move by Nynex as 'restructuring for growth', to
create what Allen Saunders, executive director corporate communications
at Nynex CableComms described as "a new, leaner Nynex", the initial
market reaction was negative, with shares dropping 1.5p. Longer term, a
more positive response on shares is expected, but Nynex had
underperformed the market by 25% over the last three months.

With the departure of former president Eugene Connell to the US, John
Killian has been appointed joint CEO and president at Nynex CableComms,
his former separate role of chief financial officer disappearing.
Similarly, Sally Davies, responsible for regulatory affairs and
development, is moving to Nynex in the US, her duties spread among
other staff.

And as the company consolidates to a central sales organisation, with
centralised installation, maintenance and repair and customer services,
there will no longer be separate North and South directors of
operations, with the director of operations South, Peter Morse,
resigning. Accounting and management support are expected to see most
losses, through a combination of natural wastage, voluntary and
involuntary redundancies.

"The cuts are spread across the board, geographically, with no sacred
disciplines, and affecting all levels. We have revenue objectives which
we need to correlate with costs. If it had been a pure cost-cutting
exercise we could have just cut staff by 10% three months ago. Instead,
we have conducted a complete review with a 100-man team, and
consultants Coopers & Lybrand, which has just concluded," explained
Saunders.

He continued, "We have identified significant efficiency improvements
and are confident the new organisation is correctly sized to meet our
new business objectives. Our North and South areas will now report to a
single manager, no longer using different routes to the same
objectives."

Saunders also accepted that last year's performance was not up to
expectations, "We were delighted with our telephony penetration and low
churn, but we have never hidden our disappointment at the level of catv
penetration [18.9%] and this is still a priority issue to address."

Killian pointed out that Nynex has, "doubled in size each year since
1991," and now aims to cut life-cycle costs and achieve economies of
scale. But ironically, it is the two largest UK players, Nynex and
Telewest, which underperformed in the Goldman Sachs efficiency table,
while small players like Diamond Cable, General Cable, and Comcast UK
Cable did well.

Nynex's share price dropped to 104p at press time on January 9.

GRANADA, SKY LAUNCH GSKYB

Former Granada executive and currently controller of factual programmes
at the ITV Network Centre, Stuart Prebble, has been appointed as chief
executive of GSkyB, the new company set up by Granada and BSkyB, which
plans to launch eight new channels in late 1996. Travel Channel
commercial director Jerry Glover, meanwhile, has been named as managing
director (commercial) of GSkyB.

The GSkyB package will be available as part of Sky Multi-Channels and
will probably be spread across three transponders, possibly on Astra
1D, on which BSkyB still has some spare capacity.

The new channels will be led by Granada Gold Plus, which will offer
programming from the extensive libraries of both Granada and LWT,
including classic episodes of Coronation Street.

The other seven channels will cover a range of lifestyle topics: Health
and Beauty, Home and Garden, Food and Wine, Granada Good Life, Granada
Men and Motoring, Granada Talk TV and Granada TV Shopping Guide.

Granada Gold Plus will broadcast for 18 hours a day, while the
lifestyle channels will take the form of broadcasting blocks. Men and
Motoring, for example, will have a late evening slot, following on from
Granada Gold Plus.

All seven lifestyle channels will feature predominantly new
programming. Granada Talk TV will be produced at LWT's London studios,
while the other six channels will all come from the North West.

"This venture will open up a whole new avenue of custom programme
making," said chief operating officer of Granada Group and Chief
executive of Granada's television division, Charles Allen, "enabling us
to significantly expand our program production facilities in both
London and the North West." With the addition of a new air-time sales
team within Laser, Granada's London-based sales house, the new venture
is expected to create around 200 new positions.

Granada's economic interest in the channel is 60%, although its
ownership is limited to 20% under current regulations. However, Granada
is hoping the government will remove the ownership restrictions on
broadcasters becoming involved in satellite operations, and thus allow
it to increase its ownership in the new venture to reflect its economic
participation.

The cost of the venture is expected to be #25 million over its first
two years, including start-up costs of #10 million. It hopes to be in
profit in three years and repay the initial investment in four years.
In the long run Granada also hopes to develop these channels for the
international market.

AB LAUNCHES CHANNEL FOR DIGITAL BOUQUET

Leading French youth TV producer AB-Productions (Dorothee and sitcom
number one Helane et les Garaons) offered its young audience a new
channel for Christmas. Launched live during a party on December 7, AB
Channel 1 is broadcasting series and sitcoms programming via a Belgacom
transponder on Eutelsat II F1 at 13 degrees East.

AB1 is the first channel of a future digital bouquet, the seventh in
France, after those announced by Canal Plus, CLT, TF1, Arte, France
Television and France Telecom. According to AB, in a few months time
the current analogue Eutelsat transponder will be switched into a
multiplex of nine digital channels, each of them dedicated to a
thematic genre: classic movies, thrillers, cartoons, comedy, romance,
action films, documentaries and adult.

Two other transponders would be used afterwards to upgrade the offer to
25 digital channels within two years. The digital package will be
offered to DTH viewers as well as cable. For the latter, AB's policy
will be to let the MSOs use their own conditional access if desired, in
exchange for offering the whole package.

Such an ambitious project has aroused surprise and doubt among the
French media world, especially since AB-Productions is a small company
in comparison to the TV giants engaged in the digital race.

It is understood that the company is in talks with four companies with
the aim of acquiring a whole package, including an encryption system, a
set-top-box and a subscription management service, but AB declined to
comment if such names as Canal Plus, France Telecom, Nethold or Kirch
are among the candidates.

Despite the choice of a Hot Bird slot, the channel's audience is
limited to the few motorised dish owners who receive the 12GHz band of
the transponder thanks to their multiband converters, indispensable to
receive the French channels elsewhere, on the Telecom 2 satellites. The
majority of the million or so French DTH viewers use fixed dishes with
monoband converters: 12 GHz LNBs for Telecom 2 or 11 GHz LNBs for the
Astra and Eutelsat series.

Cable is therefore essential to increase the audience. AB1 was granted
a cable licence by the CSA on December 21, despite the fact that the
channel currently screens mostly US-made products from the catalogue of
14,000 hours of programming that AB-Productions acquired on
international markets. Negotiations have already begun with French
cable operators.

Capacity is scarce on most cable networks, especially in Paris where
the basic tier is full and only two D2 Mac upper-tier channels remain
vacant. According to Videopole, it could be the first company to offer
AB1, if negotiations over the price lead to an agreement. AB is asking
a Ffr 2,50 per subscriber per month carriage fee after a six-month free
trial.

FRANCE TELECOM SLAMMED IN REPORT

French minister for Post, Telecommunications and Space, Franaois
Fillon, unveiled last week the main points of the report he ordered
last September from Georges Vanderchmitt, a former adviser of French
audit body Cour des Comptes. Fearing that France could miss out in the
digital race by having too many digital bouquet projects, Fillon
demanded a clear overview of the country's policy on satellite
telecommunications.

The Vanderchmitt report recommends the creation of a "digital super
alliance" between all the major French players, (public and private)
with broadcasters' access to the set-top boxes ensured "under fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions". The report insists on
the necessity to guarantee competition among the players inside the
alliance while having a strong policy on an external offer. Thanks to
digital technology, the latter should be adapted to the different
geographical zones it targets.

Vanderchmitt foresees that the digital market should be supervised
together by the CSA and the Conseil de la Concurrence (competition
body).

In his report, Vanderchmitt wants at the same time "to help Eutelsat to
set up a credible alternative to Astra" by changing the organisation's
structure, while he would also "establish stronger links" with Astra.
The Luxemburg system could be, according to him, "the dominant operator
in the French sky within the next three years".

The Telecom 3 series of crafts, however, is condemned by the report
which underlines the fact that Telecom 2D still has no clients.
Moreover, Vanderchmitt claims that France Telecom paid "too little
attention to marketing" and is now "marginalized and isolated". The
report concludes that the company is not in a situation to compete
anyway and should give up its DTH activities, by slipping "towards a
role of satellite services provider" only.

Commenting on the Vanderchmitt report, minister Fillon said France
Telecom's role in satellite television needs to be "redefined" and
recommended "more cooperation" with Eutelsat. Fillon also stressed that
the prejudice against the SES has to be ended and agreed with the
report's remarks that cable and satellite jurisdictions have to be
harmonized and lightened, mainly by bringing French law in line with
the European directive on transfrontier broadcasting signals.

Fillon revealed that he has ordered another report from former TDF
general director Philippe Levrier on whether or not to develop digital
terrestrial television.

BBC SEEKS EXPLANATION OF ORBIT 'CENSORSHIP'

The BBC is to "investigate as a matter of the utmost importance"
reports that Orbit has been censoring its Arabic news channel's
coverage of the case of Saudi dissident Mohammed al-Mas'ari. Senior BBC
and Orbit representatives were due to meet to discuss the alleged
editorial interference as CSE went to press.

According to Arabic and UK press reports, blackouts of the BBC's al-
Mas'ari reports started on Friday 5 January and continued over the
weekend. A spokesman for BBC Worldwide, which produces the Arabic-
language channel under a long-term contract with Orbit, said that
reports of "repeated interruptions" to the service had been confirmed -
but it was not yet clear whether this was deliberate censorship of the
al-Mas'ari deportation story or a "technical fault...we do not yet know
the source of the interruptions," he said.

Orbit was "concerned" about the reports and would be "looking into the
matter", a spokesman said - but would not comment further beyond
insisting that "reports of subscribers seeking compensation are
unfounded".

If the blackouts were deliberate, Orbit will have infringed the terms
of its contract with BBC Worldwide which guaranteed the editorial
independence of the service, as well as its pledges not to resort to
censorship. The BBC spokesman said that coverage of the Mas'ari case
would continue on the Arabic channel - "there has been further coverage
this week" - whatever the outcome.

For Saudi-owned Orbit, which already faces the problem of a patchily-
enforced dish ban in its home market, the al-Mas'ari affair coincided
with the first week of hard encryption - and thus could hardly have
come at a worse time. It had to face the dilemma of whether to risk
enraging the Saudi government, notoriously intolerant of journalistic
enquiry into its dealings, or of upsetting its partner and its
potential subscribers, just at the point when they were being asked to
pay for the first time. And also just before the launch of the rival
MultiChoice digital DTH package into which - it's not too hard to
imagine - a BBC-type news service could fit very well.

DR/TV2 LAUNCH DANISH SPORTS PAY-TV CHANNEL

Danish public service broadcasters, Danmarks Radio (DR) and commercial
channel TV2, together with state-controlled  Danish Telecom and Tele
Danmark are to launch a sports pay-TV channel, primarily aimed at the
some 1.3 million households (some 60% of the total population)
connected to cable systems. The new channel will eventually be also
offered via satellite to private DTH owners.

The as yet unnamed channel will primarily broadcast sports (mostly
football, the most popular sport in Denmark), as well as films and
popular entertainment.

The new project seems to have been triggered by the big deal recently
struck by DR and TV2 with the Danish Football Union - described as
"historical" by the Danish press, partly because of the amount of money
involved, and partly because it is the first time DR and TV2 have
joined forces, to fend off competition from the private commercial TV
sector.

The contract with the Danish Football Union is for eight years with a
price tag of over DKr0.5 billion, (#58m). For that money, the new pay-
TV channel, DR and TV2 will have the rights to all Danish football
(also international matches) of public interest.

Per Kregh Simonsen, head of sports at DR, commented, "From our side it
required quite a new way of commercial thinking. And without our trump
card, the new pay service, we would never had been able to land the
contract."

One snag in the project, is that under Danish law, Tele Danmark is not
allowed to be involved in programming operations, but it is expected
that the law will be changed by the Danish parliament this summer.

Despite the law, Tele Danmark, which is expected to put up most of the
investment money for the project, has obviously had plans to launch a
pay-TV service for some time. One year ago, it recruited one of
Denmark's most respected personalities in the film and media business,
Bo Christiansen, who has a long history with Denmark's biggest film and
media group, Nordisk Film, and is believed to have been instrumental in
planning the new sports service. Peter Herforth, former MD of Nordisk
Film Production, was recently hired to manage the new station.

The new pay-TV service will be offered at a monthly fee of DKr100 and
is expected to break even with a subscriber level of around 200,000
households.

NETHOLD/TV4 FORM STRATEGIC ALLIANCE

Swedish TV4 and Nethold Nordic have formed a strategic alliance. From
occasional collaboration in recent years - mainly in the sports field -
the leading Swedish commercial station and the increasingly
multinational Nethold have now realised their cooperation into a fully-
fledged alliance. Furthermore, TV4 and FilmNet have jointly taken over
an office building in Stockholm that used to be the Swedish head-
quarters of Philips.

Jan Friedman, vice president of Nethold Nordic, said the new alliance
would "spread throughout" the two companies, and that it would also
lead to similar alliances with local broadcasters in other Nordic
territories.

TV4 and Nethold/FilmNet have identified a number of areas where the new
alliance will take effect: Joint acquisitions of programme rights, both
to films and mini-series, sports and other big events. Instrumental in
this area is Nethold's acquisitions organisation, Holland-based ProNet.

Friedman points out that in Europe, ProNet acquires rights for FilmNet
not only in the Nordic Countries and Benelux, but also in Poland, Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus and Italy: Joint
co-production of Swedish movies and TV-movies together with local
production companies. Over a three-year period TV4 and FilmNet will
invest SKr 30 million (#3m), of which FilmNet will provide one third.
"We will also cooperate in producing other kinds of programming, like
fillers and film magazines", said Friedman.

If and when TV4 launches its second channel, satellite-delivered TV4
Plus, as it is called internally, it will be exclusively distributed
via Nethold's digital platforms. The parties have also agreed to
include the existing TV4 transmissions, also with exclusive satellite
rights, on the Nethold platform.

Nethold's SMS operation, MultiChoice, will also be made available for
TV4 in many different areas. Nethold's digital platforms are expected
to be used by TV4 in future news services, home shopping, games etc.

In the sports field, where FilmNet and TV4 have already established
different ways of cooperating, for instance in sharing rights like the
Swedish national ice hockey league and the English Premier Football
League, plans are now to establish shared programme archives, research
functions and news desk services for TV4 .

FilmNet is already a client for the TV4 air-time sales group, but the
airtime bought in the future by FilmNet is expected to increase
considerably.

It has been hinted in the Swedish trade press that a future element of
cross-ownership would be a very plausible development of the new
strategic alliance.

STRONG SALES FOR DTH IN 1995

UK sales of satellite receiving equipment revitalised during 1995.
BSkyB reports that 904,555 units were sold during 1995, however this
will include non-domestic sales, to pubs, sports and social clubs
together with resales between satellite retailers.

Included in the total is the largest ever sales figure for a single
week, 40,153, for the week ending December 16. The total amount of
sales in December was 111,320. The actual installed base of satellite
homes increased by 339,000 reflecting replacement sales and churn.

According to Continental Research, on December 31, 1995 the installed
base of UK satellite homes had risen to 3.698 million, including 55,000
smatv homes. The number of UK smatv homes has progressively fallen over
recent years, often resulting from the growth of cable services.
Continental estimates the total of UK cable homes at December 31 to be
1.205 million.

The UK DTH market has been spurred by the offer of "under #100"
receivers from manufacturers including Pace and, under the Minerva
brand, Grundig. According to market research company GfK, Pace now
holds over 40% of the UK market with Pace increasing its volume sales
for November year-on-year by 66%.

The combined growth of DTH and cable homes for the fourth quarter of
1995 was 232,000. New dish installations - replacement sales continue
to run at a little over one in three - represented 135,000 homes
eclipsing cable at 97,000.

Cable installations had been running ahead of new dish homes. The DTH
renaissance can be attributed to pre-Christmas sales, particularly in
non-cable areas, where the only way to gain access to the new media
channels is through a dish. The launch of Astra 1D, which operates at
frequencies lower than a majority of the installed base of equipment
can receive, will also be a factor.

According to Continental Research director David Chilvers, in order for
cable to reach more homes the installed base would have to consistently
grow at over 100,000 more per quarter than DTH homes - a target which
cable has so far found unattainable. At this rate cable would still not
eclipse DTH until well after the turn of the century.

A new study by Continental shows that the saturation point for cable
and satellite television in the UK to be 35%. The 35% penetration,
equivalent to eight million homes, is in line with Continental's last
major forecast produced, separately, last April.

Chilvers added that generation effects will create an impact in around
20 years time creating a slow build up in penetration. Chilvers likens
future growth to the telephone where penetration grew quickly to 80%,
but the last 20% is proving more difficult.

DIGITAL DTH OUTSHINES CABLE PROSPECTS

Cable penetration rates could be significantly held back in European
markets where digital direct-to-home pay-per-view has first-mover
advantages, according to a new circular from SBC Warburg.

The investment bank, whose conclusions are based on the last 18 months
of satellite-delivered PPV in the US, says with average DirecTv and
USSB subscribers generating PPV sales of $17 (#11) per month, "the
signs are that PPV can become a really significant generator of
business for BSkyB and Canal Plus. In our BSkyB model, we
conservatively estimate PPV revenues in 2002 of #200 million. Based on
the US experience, that implies about 800,000 subscribers spending #10
per month. We could easily be a factor of five times too low."

"This is not good news for the European cable industry, and those
operators who are either still building out their networks or who have
not yet upgraded narrowband... may find progress difficult if digital
satellite has first-mover advantages," claims SBC Warburg.

DirecTv, which has targeted operational breakeven for the second half
of this year, or three million subscribers, notched up its one
millionth customer in November. SBC Warburg says the Hughes-backed
venture has been scoring PPV buy rates of between 150 and 200 per cent
on some of its movies - five to six times higher than on cable.

According to the report, European Media Monthly, in October last year
almost 80% of DirecTv and USSB subscribers registered PPV buys, with
3.78 the average number of monthly purchases. Estimated PPV revenue for
the month was $13 million for DirecTv and USSB, and $16 million for
cable operator-backed DTH service Primestar.

PPV on US cable, meanwhile, has been plagued by poor release windows, a
lack of channel capacity and confusing listing schedules in TV guides,
says SBC Warburg.

By comparison, DirecTv and the other digital DTH service providers are
devoting 60-plus channels to near-video-on-demand PPV and have
developed more user-friendly electronic programme guides.

More bad news for the cable industry, says the bank, is that DirecTv,
which is growing at a rate of 90,000-100,000 new subscribers per month,
has been recruiting up to 50% of its customer base from cabled areas,
while over 40% were or continue to be subscribers to cable.
"Furthermore, those subscribers lured away tend to be the big spenders
who part with more than $60 per month to feed their TV appetites,"
notes the report.

Cable operators hoping to fend off digital DTH with local programming
services may also be disappointed, suggests SBC Warburg, since "these
are not a driver of subscriber take-up."

NEW DEBATE ON GERMAN BROADCASTING LAW

Only four weeks after the premiers of each of Germany's 16 states
reached a compromise on the long-disputed new broadcasting act, a new
list of controversial points have come to the fore.

The main bone of contention is the media ownership rules and whether
new media or digital services will require licences from the media
authorities. The SPD-governed states are now demanding that no single
owner can have a significant stake in companies which together hold an
audience share of 25%. This would mean, for example, that the Kirch
Group could not hold stakes in channels which have a market share over
25%. If the stake exceeds 30%, new anti-trust regulation would come
into force. Besides this strongly-criticised point, the social
democrats want television channels with over 10% marketshare to be
obliged to distribute their programming within an independent company.
Spiegel TV has its own licence scheduling its magazines on Sat l and
RTL Television. If the other premiers agree to these new demands, the
social democrats will agree to the media ownership ruling allowing
shareholders to own 100% in one television channel, 49.9% in the next
and 24.9% in other special interest programmes.

To control all these regulations, the prime ministers intend to
establish a new media concentration commission (KEK) acting alongside
the media authorities. The commission would be closely involved in the
decisions of the media authorities.

There is also a question mark over the limits on public programming and
its financing. Much of the monthly public fee of DM 23,80 (#10.70) is
needed to fund the ARD and its member stations administration. Many
politicians and commercial stations are demanding that ARD and ZDF stop
their expansion and broadcast news, information, culture, children's
programming and a mixture of entertainment as in the past.

The commission for financing public broadcasting KEF has to come up
with a proposal for the next broadcasting fee which runs from 1997 to
the year 2000. According to the government of Lower Saxony, the
broadcasting fee will increase to DM28.25 a month - an increase of
DM4.45. The ARD will receive DM2.35 and ZDF DM2.05. The money will help
fund a new parliamentary and a children's channel to be launched by the
ARD from 1997 - a move strongly criticised by private broadcasters
association VPRT, which fears that the new publicly-financed special
interest channels will target commercial channels as Nickelodeon and
all-news channels such as N-TV.

On February 8, the premiers will meet again to try and reach a new
agreement on the act.

UAP VERSIONS TCC AND DISCOVERY

United Artists Programming has introduced a version of TCC for the
Nordic market and for Discovery in the Netherlands. TCC has now also
been withdrawn from the Dutch market though minimal distribution
through the VideoCrypt II package will continue for the time being.

A backhaul was introduced on January 1 for TCC Nordic to feed the Thor
satellite which has previously taken the single UK-produced version
from Astra. The backhaul is at present transmitted in clear analogue
Pal from Intelsat 601, though the intention is to switch to an
encrypted feed in the near future.

UAP vice president, distribution Andrew Shaw said that soundtracks in
the four Scandinavian languages - Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and
Finnish - would represent 45% of TCC Nordic's output. He said TCC had
reached the point in the Nordic region where such local versioning was
feasible. 80% of TCC subscribers in Scandinavia are now able to view
the Nordic version and Shaw expects this to be brought up to a near
100% within a few months. At the same time TCC is, at 1.2 million
homes,  closing the distribution gap on Discovery, the result of the
transponder share on Thor, which allows cable operators to take a
seamless feed of the two channels.

General manager Franklin Getchell said TCC Nordic had been created as a
totally separate service running for 12 hours a day as opposed to the
11 hours of the Astra service. TCC is on-air between 06.00 and 18.00
CET. "The 12 hours will be a mix of programming. All of the live action
programming will be regionalised, the pre-school will be added by the
end of the year." Programming for older children, including some of the
high-profile animation will be subtitled. For younger children dubbing
will be used where the rights allow it. Three quarters will be dubbed
by the end of 1996.

The decision to withdraw TCC from the Dutch market follows the
acquisition by parent company Flextech of a 33% share in the Dutch
language children's channel Kindernet. While Kindernet has a virtual
saturation penetration of the market at 5.5 million, TCC is only
available to 850,000 homes, principally in the Rotterdam area. TCC's
long-time refusal to pay for carriage in the region means distribution
is unlikely to increase further.

Discovery Channel, which has been available in the Netherlands since
1989 and is available in 4.3 million homes, will carry Dutch continuity
announcements on a separate audio subcarrier. In addition Discovery
will be increasing the amount of programming reversioned into the Dutch
language and intends to buy some Dutch documentaries. Teletext
subtitling in the Dutch language will be expanded with the goal of
offering subtitles on 95% of output by the end of the year.

BSKYB JOINS RTR FOR RUSSIAN BOUQUET?

Russian national public broadcaster RTR has forged a joint venture with
a "unnamed UK partner" to launch the country's first digital satellite-
delivered service from Intelsat 604. Sources suggest that this UK
partner is none other than British Sky Broadcasting. According to
Stanislav Bunievich, the station's deputy chairman and director of
engineering, RTR Network has formed a joint venture with a UK partner
(he declined to give a name) to launch - at a cost of between $10 to
$15 million (#6.5-9.7m) for equipment alone - two channels (sport and
movies) this spring. Distributed by Intelsat 604, they will probably be
followed by further channels for medical, business and children's
television and be available to an audience of some 40 million
"collective customers" - such as those served by cable networks -
throughout the former Soviet Union.

Bunievich says the idea behind the RTR Network is to introduce viewers
to the idea of paying for their programming, which in his view is now
"the main way for television to develop in Russia." It is also an
attempt to make the broadcaster less dependent on the government for
its funding and lessen the burden of having to pay 75% of its revenue
to the ministry of telecommunications for the use of transmission
facilities.

Although RTR Network is currently negotiating agreements with several
foreign programme-providers, Bunievich feels there is a need for
Russian material which it will have to meet. He also believes there
will be exceptionally strong interest shown in the new service's
children's and medical channels and that within the next two to five
years RTR, though remaining state-owned, will become a holding company
for RTR Network and other commercial ventures.

HUNGARIAN COMMERCIAL TV IN THE WINGS

Hungary is soon to have commercial television now that the Hungarian
Parliament has finally passed the long-awaited broadcasting bill, which
is now waiting to be approved by the Hungarian president. In mid-
October, the six main parliamentary parties in Hungary came to a back
room agreement over the future of the nation's state-run television
stations and the law was passed at the end of December.

The broadcasting bill will have the greatest effect on state-owned TV
network Magyar Televizio (MTV) which now faces the prospect of its
second public chain MTV2 being privatised. The terrestrial frequency of
MTV2 will be offered in concession for ten years and the current MTV2
programme will be aired by satellite with an intended viewership of
ethnic Hungarians both inside and outside contemporary national
borders. The largest commercial radio station Danubius will also be
privatised. The main state channel, MTV1 and satellite-delivered
channel Duna TV will remain largely untouched, however.

Saatchi & Saatchi Budapest senior media planner Andreas Vigh says that
another terrestrial frequency will be opened [in the public tender],
possibly under the name of MTV3, which, at the beginning, would have
60% to 70% penetration. This national channel will also be offered in
concession for ten years. The arrival of commercial television in
Hungary is set to kick-start the industry, he says. "The state channels
will have to become much more competitive and produce better quality
programming."

MTV2 which has an 80% penetration rate will be privatised with a view
towards starting up in January of 1997, along with the new MTV3.

A tender for MTV2 is expected to be announced sometime this spring and
applications will be due in July or August. The new private channel
will most likely begin broadcasting the following January. But before
the tender is announced, the new media council will have to be
appointed, and the council's first order of business will be replacing
the director of MTV, Adam Horvath, who resigned as of January 1996.
Under the draft law, the director's powers will be significantly
reduced.

Several major media investors are expected to enter the tender for the
private channel, including MTM Communications, which has entered into a
joint venture with Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems (SBS) last
September, Central European Media Enterprises (CME), which is currently
preparing a regional TV channel in the Budapest area with the Hungarian
company 2002, and CLT. French broadcaster TF1 is also reportedly in the
running as is TV Nova operator Marc Palmer.

PREMIERE TOPS ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBERS

The first German pay-TV channel Premiere reported around 1.1 million
subscribers at the beginning of the new year 1996 generating revenues
of about DM500 million (#227m), making Premiere the fourth largest
commercial TV station in Germany, announced managing director Bernd
Kundrun. Premiere has invested about DM600 million (#273m) over the
last five years and Kundrun forecast that the company would break even
this year.

Kundrun said that the decision of MMBG and Kirch Group to develop a
standardised digital decoder was a signal for Premiere to start the
first trials in the interactive world. To produce and distribute 12
digital programmes, a company has to invest about DM 5.1 billion
(#2.3bn) over a five year period on the basis of about two million
subscribers, he said. But the revenues in the same period would only
amount to DM1.2 billion, if the subscribers pay a monthly fee of DM50.
This means digital programmes will remain a very risky business in the
next few years, he said.

In the spring, Premiere will start a trial with 1,000 households in
Hamburg. Partners in the venture are publishing companies Bauer, Axel
Springer and Gruner & Jahr/Bertelsman, retailer Otto Versand, facility
house Studio Hamburg (subsidiary of public broadcaster NDR) and
Deutsche Telekom.

CME LAUNCHES SLOVENIAN POP TV

Slovenia's broadcasting industry has received a major boost following
the launch of the country's first national independent television
service. Backed by the US-owned investment company Central European
Media Enterprises (CME) and the local stations MMTV (based in
Ljubljana) and Tele 59 (Maribor), Pop TV - a television programme
trademark of the company Pro Plus - will offer a mixture of
entertainment and information programming and initially reach some 70%
of the country's 650,000 television households.

CME, which already has direct equity interests of 58% and 33% in Pro
Plus and MMTV respectively, will shortly also acquire 33% of Tele 59.
With both its Slovenian partners also major shareholders in Pro Plus,
it will effectively have a 72% economic interest in the new venture.

According to Len Fertig, the president and CEO of CME, total investment
in Pro Plus is likely to be between #10-11.5 million, of which the
company will provide 58% and MMTV and Tele 59 the remainder. While
having to compete in an industry already served by a national public
broadcaster (TV Slovenija) and several local commercial stations
including the long-established Kanal A, the country's healthy TV ad
market (which stood at #15m) in 1994) and per capita income (#4,000)
one of the highest in central and eastern Europe) are likely to ensure
the service's survival.

Pro Plus, whose programming will be entertainment led and targeted at a
young audience, has secured agreements with most Hollywood majors and
hopes to obtain exclusive rights for Slovenian soccer. While initially
conforming to a minimum local production quota of 10%, it intends to
raise the level to 40% by the end of this year.

Although Pop TV has effectively guaranteed its status as a national
Slovenian broadcaster through being distributed by MMTV, Tele 59, TV
Robin (which serves western parts of the country) and several cable
networks, an agreement with Euro 3, a privately owned service employing
a powerful transmitter in Krvavec to cover Ljubljana and environs, fell
through after objections by Kanal A.

The latter, which is owned by Vladimir Polic and had itself at one
stage been involved in talks with CME, is believed to have a
controlling stake in Euro 3 and felt undermined by the latter's deal
with the media investment company. It is also beset by serious
financial problems and has recently benefited from a programming
agreement with Turner.

The launch of Pro Plus and its associated television network Pop TV by
CME has come shortly after the establishment of Media Pro
International, a company which will manage a new commercial network
named Pro TV in Romania. With other projects either being prepared or
up and running (and in some instances, such as the Czech Republic's TV
Nova, already highly successful), CME is rapidly becoming one of the
leading players in central and eastern Europe's television industry. As
a result, some form of networking (and therefore satellite
distribution) of its services throughout the region is a distinct
possibility in the near future.

Within Slovenia, the appearance of Pro Plus/Pop TV has nevertheless
overshadowed the launch of a further new national channel. Set up at a
cost of DM10 million (#4.5m) and backed by the Catholic Church and
several local institutions, TV3 will terrestrially broadcast around 20
hours of family-oriented programming daily to around 80% of the
population.

RADICAL CHANGES AT POLONIA 1

The Polish satellite channel Polonia 1 has begun 1996 under new
management and with a radical change in programming policy.

Set up by the Italian entrepreneur Nicola Grauso barely four years ago,
it initially operated as an unlicensed network of local terrestrial
stations before being forced out of the country and deciding to
distribute its programming by Eutelsat. On January 1 its ownership
officially passed into the hands of Mariano Vollani - once the leading
shareholder in the Czech commercial station Premiera TV - along with
several Polish and foreign investors.

According to Katarzyna Kieci, the marketing manager of Publipolska (an
agency which undertakes all commercial activities for Polonia 1), the
broadcaster will attempt to move away from the perceived image of being
a service aimed solely at women by targeting men, people aged up to 40
and young urban families.

The first changes to the 24-hour service's programming - which Kieci
says can be received by around 28% of the population - should occur in
the first week in February and the remainder will be gradually
implemented over the following month to six weeks. Besides carrying
more music, it will also show sport, news and information (with
material obtained from Euronews) and a wide range of films and
documentaries.

VIACOM POISED FOR MID-EAST LAUNCH

Viacom is developing two new channels for its five-channel Ku-Band
digital DTH package for the Middle East, which is expected to launch
via PanAmSat 4 during the first quarter.

The package will include MTV Europe and VH-1 UK, as well as a movie
channel - expected to be a version of Showtime - and new general
entertainment and children's/family channels.

Although Viacom would not elaborate on marketing plans for the service
prior to an official launch announcement "within the next two weeks,"
it is understood the package will be offered alongside ART and Nethold
channels as part of MultiChoice's Middle Eastern digital DTH operation.
This is to use the same MPEG-2/DVB standard with Irdeto conditional
access as the South African DSTV service, for which Pace has been
contracted to supply 200,000 decoders. Pace, while it has yet to ship
any DVB units into the region, is already priming its Middle Eastern
dealers with its digital 'Gold Club' scheme.

The launch of the MultiChoice mid-East bouquet, initially intended to
be pre-Christmas, is understood to have been put back to give the
partners more time to develop services which would be sufficiently
distinct from the analogue-free-to-air ART channels already popular in
the region.

CHANNEL V LAUNCHES THAI MUSIC CHANNEL

Channel V, the Star TV-owned music channel has formed a three party
deal to create and broadcast a 24-hour customised music channel for
Thailand. The new venture, to be called Channel V Thailand, is a
partnership between Channel V, pay-TV licensee Universal Cable Network
Public Company Ltd (UTV), and Broadcasting Network (Thailand) Ltd
(BNT). The latter is a 12 year old Thai company specialising in concert
promotion and music licensing.

The new channel, which is set to launch mid-March, will be an ad-free
subscription channel and will form part of UTV's premium programming
tier, although as yet the "appropriate pricing point has yet to be
decided," said Channel V executive producer Steve Greider.

As with the two other localised versions of Channel V - for India and
Taiwan, Channel V Thailand will be heavily reliant on localisation,
with most of the programming to be either dubbed or produced in Thai
and fronted by local Thai VJs. Initially, said Greider, 60% of music
videos will be Thai with the remaining 40% international. The
partnership has already built a studio in which to customise and make
new productions.

The deal with UTV is despite the fact that Star TV also has a carriage
deal on rival service ThaiSky Cable's MMDS service. According to
Greider, Star chose to go with UTV as Thaisky already has its own music
service called Smile TV. Greider said Channel V Thailand will compete
favourably with Smile TV as it will be a "much better looking channel,
that is truly Thai but produced to an international standard."

UTV is currently broadcasting 35 channels down its 64-channel capacity
fibre-optic cable network which is currently being laid in the greater
Bangkok area.

It is also rumoured that UTV and Star TV may collaborate further to
form a DTH package for Thailand. This would be beneficial to both, as
UTV would then be able to use Asiasat 2 as a distribution platform
(currently it only has C-Band capacity on Thaicom 1 and 2) and, in
turn, Star TV would gain access to the Thai DTH market by piggy-backing
on UTV's required pay-TV licence. Currently it is estimated that there
are some 400,000 back yard C-band dishes owners in Thailand, many of
whom already received Star TV.

The market for pay-TV in Thailand is both intensifying and
consolidating. In December 1995, Thai terrestrial broadcaster and pay-
TV licensee Channel 3 and Hong Kong based satellite broadcaster TVBI,
announced the formation of a joint venture company, the TVB3 Network Co
Ltd, which will launch a full service Thai language general
entertainment channel to be called Asia Entertainment Network in early
1997, using Thai dubbed Chinese programmes and Thai language programmes
produced by the joint venture company.

CZECH CABLE AND SATELLITE DEREGULATION

The Czech Parliament implemented several changes to the broadcasting
law in mid-December. It has approved extending the broadcasting rights
of CT2, the second nationwide channel, to public broadcaster Czech
Television for an indefinite period. Under a law passed in December
1992, Czech Television was granted only temporary possession of the
frequency, because the legislation agreed at that time that the second
frequency should eventually be privatised.

As of January 1, 1996, potential cable/satellite operators no longer
have to apply to the Czech Broadcasting Council for a licence, although
they must still register with the council. The council no longer has
the authority to regulate programming conditions for cable and
satellite operators. Potential operators must still obtain clearance
from the Czech telecommunication authority and a construction permit
from the municipality where the cable system will operate. The law
further reduces advertising restrictions on Czech Radio from 1% to 0.2%
for all five channels, although it is possible to group this time on
one station.

Industry analysts believe the deregulation of satellite and cable
broadcasting is partly the result of heavy lobbying on the part of HBO,
which feared the programming quotas the council wanted to implement on
cable operators which carry the pay-television channel. Some further
believe that the new decision is a compromise between supporters and
detractors of commercial broadcasting, citing that opponents of the
decision to allow Czech Television to retain its second channel were
rewarded for their support with far-reaching concessions in the
licensing of cable and satellite ventures.

Council member Helena Havledkova finds this analysis too subjective but
she agreed that the amendment, while fundamentally conforming to
European Convention regulations, is regarded as a victory for the cable
business. "HBO [and other cable operators] will be absolutely free to
do whatever they want with their programmes," she commented.

The Czech cable industry has experienced substantial investment from
foreign companies in the past two years from companies such as HBO,
which launched in the Czech Republic in November, 1994, US West
International, which purchased a 28% stake of Cable Plus, the largest
Czech cable operator, in May, 1995, and United International Holdings,
which has taken part in several cable ventures since 1993.

TERRESTRIALS SET TO TAKE ON SKY

The UK government published its broadcasting bill before Christmas
featuring some significant changes from its white paper proposals. The
new law is not expected to come into effect until summer, possibly as
late as January 1997.

Now ITV predators such as Granada, Carlton and Mai look set to flourish
under the new bill with the proposal for a two licence limit for ITV
operators abolished in favour of a new threshhold of 15% of total TV
audience. Bearing in mind that the largest ITV owner Carlton holds 9.4%
of the total audience, the scope for expansion and takeovers is great.

All but the two largest newspaper owners (News International and Mirror
group) will be able to control commercial television licences for the
first time, favouring a greater cross-ownership between newspaper
groups, TV companies and radio.

Existing terrestrial broadcasters are to be given much more digital
capacity in the new bill with the BBC awarded the best multiplex, and
ITV, Channel 5 and Channel 5 awarded half a multiplex each. In return,
the broadcasters have to air their existing channels in their entirety
in digital though they have been allowed to offer pay-TV services -
vital for their survival. With sports rights being snapped up by BSkyB,
while NBC bid $2.3 billion (#1.5bn) for the Olympics, the fear is that
the fierce bidding will also spread to entertainment. The freedom to
run a universally free and premium pay channel will place the
terrestrial broadcasters in a much more powerful position to fend off
Sky.

The government has retreated on the idea of a final date for a complete
move from analogue to digital. Instead, the analogue switch off date
will be reviewed once 50% of UK households can receive digital
terrestrial channels, or five years after the start of the first
multiplex licence.

BET ON JAZZ FOR AFRICA

Black Entertainment Television's 24-hour jazz channel, BET On Jazz: The
Cable Jazz Channel, is to join MultiChoice's South African DTH package,
DSTV, on April 1, three months after the channel launches on cable
networks in the US.

The service, first mooted in 1993 and understood to be costing $20-30
million to launch, will be offered alongside DSTV's existing 18
channels from PanAmSat 4 at no extra cost, and will be marketed in
South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Mozambique and
Botswana. Both the channel and the MultiChoice deal are breakthroughs
for BET, which, with 43.4 million cable subscribers in North America
(at November 1995), and with its domestic business already well
diversified into related media and marketing activities, is now looking
to international markets for expansion.

"This is a very big move for us," BET International vice president
George Amoah said. "Although we've been supplying programming to
African broadcasters for the last year-and-a-half on a syndicated
basis, this is the first time we've launched there in such a big way."

BETI supplied Bop-TV with an eight-hour daily block of (chiefly
educational) programming which was distributed across African and the
Middle East from a C-Band Intelsat transponder, and now supplies
similar programming to SABC's NNTV, as well as to affiliates in Kenya
and Nigeria the Caribbean, and even to Poland.

"Our plans call for global expansion," Amoah added, "and we're going
into it aggressively... our initial focus is Europe and southern
Africa."

As in the US, where BET has developed a range of complementary
businesses, BETI intends to develop similar opportunities for programme-
related merchandise in South Africa, by building up relationship with
local businesses.

While Amoah indicated that BETI was eager to bring the jazz channel to
the UK and the rest of Europe, how it will do so - whether as a
complement to the London-based BETI cable exclusive service using
additional digital capacity on Orion, or by joining national digital
DTH packages - was not yet decided.

As the world's first dedicated jazz channel, BET On Jazz promises a mix
of live concerts, classic performances, jazz movies and documentaries,
and seems destined to find big ready-made audiences across Europe and
Scandinavia.

TELEGRAAF POISED TO ACQUIRE SBS6 STAKE

Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf says its negotiations to acquire a 30%
share in SBS6 are at an advanced stage. Bank Mees Pierson is acting as
mediator for the two parties. SBS has been looking for some time for a
Dutch partner, because the channel wants to strengthen its local
presence. SBS has strong financial backing including ABC/Cap Cities and
Paramount/Viacom, but a link with a major Dutch publishing house could
be beneficial for both parties and give the broadcaster a more Dutch
face. SBS experienced a slow start late last August, but now claims
about 92% cable penetration in the country as well as a slowly
increasing market share.

De Telegraaf currently has only very limited new media investments. The
company owns local radio station Radio Amsterdam as well as a cabletext
newspaper (with rolling text pages) also in its home town of Amsterdam.
Together with PCM Publishers De Telegraaf owns 5% in the A2000/KTA
Amsterdam cablenetwork. The company's investment in SBS6 would mark a
departure from its otherwise conservative acquisition policy. Dutch
publisher Wegener announced its talks to acquire the Arcade Media
Group, who owns TV10 Gold, The Music Factory and three radio stations,
have successfully ended. Wegener will take control of Arcade for an
undisclosed sum, which insiders estimate to be around Gld300 million
(#120m). The new company will be known as Wegener-Arcade. Arcade is
privately owned, with three quarter of the shares owned by
founder/president Herman Heinsbroek, who will remain with the new
company as a consultant. The second man of the company, A de Liefde,
will take a seat on the board of Wegener-Arcade.

POLL GAUGES BELGIAN SUBSCRIBER SATISFACTION

The quality of cable distribution varies depending on the region where
subscribers live, particularly regarding the number of programmes
available, the quality of the retransmission and the cable subscription
fee, according to a survey conducted by consumers' association Test-
Achats. Each of the 36 cable distributors operating in Belgium enjoys a
monopoly in its own franchise territory and not all of them have put
the same efforts into upgrading their network and meeting their
subscribers' wishes, notes Test-Achats.

The number of channels available on cable varies from 19 in the
Ardennes region to 37 in Limburg, while cable capacity ranges from 24
to 73 channels. The cost of a new connection varies from Bfr1,346 in
Brussels to Bfr4,033 (#29-#88) in some parts of Brabant, while the
delay required before being connected can be anything from 3 days to 3
weeks. As regards the subscription fee, it can vary from Bfr 4,000 to
Bfr 5,000 (#88-#108), but without any bearing on the number of channels
provided by the cable distributor.

The survey also shows that cable subscribers' chief complaint is lack
of consultation with them by cable companies regarding the choice of
channels they receive. In both linguistic regions, viewers show,
unsurprisingly, a strong preference for channels broadcasting in their
own language. However, it seems that, in Flanders, subscribers would
also like to have access to French-speaking channels such as Tele 21,
Club RTL, Arte, TV5 and Canal Plus, while French-speaking viewers in
Wallonia fell they are deprived of VTM, Filmnet and CNN. Obviously,
subscribers are not aware that copyright licences, administrative rules
and political motivations prevent cable distributors to broadcasting
Canal Plus in Flanders and FilmNet in Wallonia.

Test-Achats concludes, saying that, most subscribers seem satisfied
with their cable distributor, the average of dissatisfied subscribers
varying from 5 to 10%. The main reasons for dissatisfaction are lack of
consultation of customers (46%), the non-availability of certain
channels (35%) and poor reception quality.

MC EUROPE JOINS PREMIERE PACKAGE

Pay-TV channel Premiere is to trial Music Choice Europe's digital audio
service in a commercial trial this spring. The arrangement is expected
to lead to a full launch in the Cologne area during the autumn and a
national rollout in 1997 as part of Premiere's Astra-delivered digital
package. Competitor DMX expects to receive Astra carriage as part of
the MultiChoice package and already utilises capacity on the first four
Astras.

MC Europe sales and marketing director Jennifer Churchill said that a
number of pricepoints would be trialled on the Cologne network, which
has 268,000 homes connected. Existing pricing ranges from #7.45 per
month in the United Kingdom to an equivalent #12.00 in Norway. In
Cologne the pricing may be as low as DM5 per month, but as director of
business strategy Simon Bazalgette pointed out the cost of the rental
cost of the General Instrument decoder is generally included.

While adopted by Deutsche Telekom as its preferred premium audio
service MC Europe still has the task of applying to each of the 15
regional media authorities. To date licences have been applied for and
obtained from each of the larger regions; Bavaria, Northrhine
Westphalia and Hessen. MC Europe's themed music service includes local
channels such as Deutscher Rock, Golden Schlager and Volksmusik.

Chief executive Stuart Graber said MC Europe was building its
distribution and was now available in "well over eight million homes
all over Europe," including a significant deal recently concluded with
Telewest in the UK.

Asked about repeated rumours of a merger with the European operations
of DMX Graber responded that MC Europe had, "the right combination of
partners and the right strategy to do the job of building a business."
MC Europe had concentrated on the programming rather than the
technology. The two companies, said Graber, were considerably different
in their management style.

Churchill is confident of increasing the potential subscriber base to
over 20 million by the end of 1996. She sees further opportunities as
cable operators migrate towards digital services. "When we started it
was in analogue and we've been able to work with the cable operators,
they enjoy working with us, and all have plans to go digital.

MC Europe has now added Comcast's Cleveland and Darlington franchises
to its roster of UK cable operators. The service will potentially be
available to an additional 225,000 homes. It follows the rollout onto
the Birmingham franchise.

NOZEMA PLANS TO SHELVE CASEMA STAKE

Dutch transmission company Nozema wants to shelve its 22 % stake in
Dutch MSO Casema - and KPN is quick to express its interest in gaining
full control of the company. KPN now owns 76.7% of Casema, Holland's
major MSO with over 1.2 connected cable homes.

Nozema is a Dutch company that owns and operates the transmitters for
Dutch public and private television and radio broadcasters. The company
is partially privatised, but the Dutch government plans to sell the
remaining 59% share it still owns later this year. Once completely
privatised, Nozema will need to invest heavily in new transmitters for
the upcoming DAB and terrestrial digital television. Therefore, it
wants to shed its Casema shares and concentrate on its core business of
terrestrial broadcasting. Nozema has appointed the British bank
Rothschild to handle the sale of its share in Casema.

KPN's intention to buy up Nozema's shares in Casema have angered
Minister Jorristma of Transport and Communication, who says KPN's share
in Casema should be decreased. The minister is afraid that Dutch cable
companies will not start cable telephony in competition with KPN as
long as KPN is a major shareholder in Casema. After acquiring Nozema's
shares KPN would own 99.3% of Casema. The company wants to have a
strong hold on Casema when its planned merger with the cable systems of
Philips Media takes place.

Casema announced it wants to double its capital by issuing new shares.
The company says it needs fresh capital to invest in updating its cable
networks and offering new services. Casema plans to issue new shares
worth Gld175 million (#70m) only with its existing shareholders.

ARCADE GAINS AMSTERDAM ACCESS

From January 17 the two channels from the Arcade Media Group (TV10 and
The Music Factory) will at last be carried by the A2000/KTA network of
Amsterdam, but not all problems have been solved. A2000/KTA demands a
payment of Gld750,000 (#300,000) per channel per year (equalling
Gld1.50 per subscriber per channel), an amount which is five to six
times what Arcade pays to other cable operators. It is also much higher
than the amounts other broadcasters such as RTL4, Veronica and SBS6 are
paying A2000.

Arcade claims A2000 is misusing its monopoly and filed a complaint with
the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. It also began proceedings at
the Court of Amsterdam to force entrance to A2000. The Amsterdam judge
refused to rule as long as the proceedings at the Ministry are still
ongoing, but suggested the two parties to agree voluntary to a
temporary solution. The agreement between Arcade and A2000 calls for
monthly payments of Gld62,500 (#25,000) per channel until Arcade's
complaint at the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been resolved. Should
the ministry decide A2000's behaviour constitutes misuse of a monopoly,
the money will be restituted to Arcade.

SHAW, COGECO LAUNCH INTERNET SERVICES

Hot on the heels of Rogers Cablesystems' announcement of Wave, its
cable-modem PC access service, two more Canadian MSOs are dipping their
feet in the Internet. Shaw Communications has signed an agreement in
principle with Motorola for the purchase of 100,000 CyberSurfer cable
modems and Cogeco Cable has announced a partnership with St.Remy Press
Inc. for the development and marketing of a PC-based, mulitmedia
platform supporting a virtual shopping mall, to be run on its cable
network.

While Wave is now up and running, Shaw's access service is just
entering trials now and won't be launched until autumn. "We are looking
at some innovative concepts in packaging different tiers of services,"
said Brian Walters, Shaw's vice president for PC interactive services.
We are in the process of looking at the way we can nurture content
developers. At the end of the day we have to have an open platform so
that anyone who wants to, can be there."

Walters added that Shaw's basic Internet service will feature local
content, such as municipal services, entertainment and events tailored
to specific communities. Cogeco launched an Internet access service in
December and is in the process of rolling it out through its Quebec and
Ontario cable systems. It plans to test its virtual mall next spring,
for two months and then roll it out on a commercial basis. So far, all
of the announced cable provided PC access services are charging
somewhere in the C$35-$40 (#15-20) range, depending on whether or not
the modem is purchased or rented.

CANADA PLANS WORLD'S LARGEST MMDS SYSTEM

Manitoba-based Craig Broadcast Systems Inc. plans to become the world's
largest MMDS broadcaster in terms of geography. "It will be the largest
system in the world," said Stuart Craig, president and managing
director. "Nobody has ever tried this before. We will be broadcasting
from the Ontario to the Saskatchewan borders, east to west and from the
52 parallel to the American border, north to south."

In effect, Craig will be building a broadcast network that will
eventually cover more than half a million square kilometres with a
potential audience of slightly over one million.

"Manitoba is an ideal place for wireless cable with its flat terrain.
It's perfect for the delivery of signals and of course we have high
towers across the province which makes the project viable." Craig
Broadcast's wholly owned subsidiary SkyCable won the first licence
allocated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission, (CRTC) on December 20.

Craig has applied for an MMDS licence four times, beginning in 1983.
'The past applications were not successful because of CRTC decisions
and policies favouring cable." SkyCable's present business plans call
for investing C$26 million (#13m) to build nine transmission sites that
will reach 80% of Manitoba's population. Its initial target will be the
50,000 rural Manitobans who are outside cable areas. It will then
compete with existing cable companies in urban areas.

The addressable digital service will initially offer 40 channels of
programming including local, off the air stations, Canadian and
American networks and speciality channels, pay-per-view, pay TV, local
community channels and an educational channel and intends to upgrade to
60 channels.

Subscribers will pay a C$100 (#50) installation charge and a C$200
refundable deposit on the reception equipment. Antennas will vary in
size depending on the location of the nearest transmitter, ranging from
an 18 inch by 18 inch wire mesh receiver to a pencil-like antenna.

Subscription costs will be competitive with cable, starting with an
$18.95, 20 channel basic package and including three advanced tiers
ranging from $6.00 to $8.95. Craig's business plan calls for signing up
30,000 subscribers to be successful. He believes that compared to the
$1,000 plus costs of DTH systems, his MMDS network will prove
attractive to Manitobans.

HUGHES OPTS FOR SEA LAUNCH TO LOWER PRICES

Sea Launch, the first commercial satellite launching system to lift off
from an ocean-going platform has sold an initial series of ten launches
to Hughes Space and Communication Co, the Los Angeles-based satellite
manufacturer. It is the rocket consortium's first contract and the
financial details have not been released, although the contract's value
is believed to be in the $500 million (#325m) range.

Hughes' launches are scheduled to begin in 1998. Sea Launch Co is an
international joint venture with Boeing Commercial Space Co being the
lead partner with 40% of the equity, followed by Norwegian shipbuilder
the Kvaerner Group with 30%, Ukrainian rocket builder NPO Yuzhnoye with
15%, and Russian engine producer RSC Energia holding the remaining 25%.

The contract is seen as one of a series of moves by Hughes to 1ower the
price of commercial satellite launches by backing a number of different
launching systems. Large commercial satellite launches vary in cost
from $80 million (#52m) from reliable western providers, while Chinese
launches are believed to be in the $40 million (#26m) range. In the
past, Hughes has supported Chinese launch systems and recently gave a
ten launch contract to McDonnel Douglas Corp as an incentive to develop
a new rocket.

When asked if Hughes was attempting to lower the cost of launching
satellites, A spokesman for the Boeing space program replied, "If you
subscribe to the opinion, the more competition the better the price,
then I think that is the correct assumption. One of the goals of our
system is to be more cost effective and very competitive in price."

Sea Launch will be based in southern California. The Ukrainians will be
providing two stage Zenit rockets for the project while the Russians
will be supplying the upper stage or the rocket and other key systems.
The rockets will be assembled on a 650 foot (197)m long assembly and
command ship being built by the Kvaerner Group in Glasgow which is also
converting a 450 foot oil rig into a launch platform. Boeing is
supplying project management. The assembly and command ship will
probably be located in Long Beach, California and the launches will
take place in international waters in the Pacific.

CAPE BLAZE DASHES DSTV HOPES

MultiChoice's hopes of meeting early sales targets for its South
African digital DTH package, DSTV, have been dashed as a result of the
fire which destroyed the Cape Town factory producing Panasonic's MPEG-
2/DVB receivers in December, leaving the market totally dependent on
Pace.

The fire, apparently caused by an electrical fault, caused R30 million
(#5.31 million) worth of damage, destroying the production line from
which Panasonic was hoping to deliver 35,000 digital boxes before the
end of the year.

At the time of the fire, Panasonic had shipped only some "two to three
thousand" receivers, according to MultiChoice general manager marketing
Cobus Scholtz, who confirmed that the fire had "severely affected"
early roll-out targets for the 16-channel DTH service.

Soon after the fire, Panasonic said it hoped to restore production by
February. However, the full extent of the damage only became clear
later, and according to MultiChoice general manager, sales and
distribution, Deon Coetzee, Panasonic is now unlikely to be able to
supply any units until April, thus threatening prolonged shortages.
"Fortunately for us, Pace has come to the party rather nicely," he
said, "They're expected to supply 15,000 units in January and 10,000 in
February."

Hopes that Grundig might emerge as an alternative supplier had not
materialised, Coetzee added: "I understand they are still in talks with
Irdeto in Europe over the conditional access system." Grundig is
however expected to supply DVB IRDs for the consortium launching a
German language digital package for Africa. Meanwhile Echostar is
expected to bring its Star Walker approved DVB receivers into the
market, but not until March/April.

Despite the setbacks, Coetzee estimated sales since the DSTV launch in
November had totalled around 10,000 - "not too bad, considering." While
much of the momentum created by the first phase of marketing had been
wasted because there wasn't product to meet demand, he added, a "second
thrust" would be launched in late January, highlighting the latest
additions to the package: Discovery in early January, plus a local
Christian channel, Rhema; with EBN, Sci-Fi Channel, Bloomberg, Zee TV
and BET On Jazz to follow over the coming months.

EXPRESSVU, DIRECTV GET DTH LICENCES

On December 20, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission licensed Expressvu and Power DirecTv as authorised providers
of DTH services in Canada. It rejected a bid by Homestar, owned by a
cable consortium led by Canada's second largest MSO, Shaw
Communications.

Homestar's bid was rejected because the commission judged that it would
not be able to gain transponder space. Homestar intended to lease space
from Primestar, the American DTH operator owned by cable MSOs.
Primestar recently lost an orbital slot when the American Federal
Communications Commission took back the one it had intended to use to
launch a DBS satellite.

While DTH licences have now been granted, it is still uncertain as to
when operations will finally begin. Power DirecTv had asked the
commission to establish a cable tax on all cable subscribers to cover
its estimated C$17 million (#8.5m) in uplink costs. Without the tax,
Power DirecTv has said that it won't be able to turn a profit. Power
DirecTV is now considering its options and has declined to state what
it will do.

ExpressVu, which had originally been granted a licensing exemption in a
bid to kick-start cable competition is once again stalled in technical
problems with a glitch in its descrambling technology.

ExpressVu had originally been slated to launch last September but
failed to do so claiming at the time that the cable companies were
hogging transponder space. ExpressVu now believes that it will be in
service by the second quarter of 1996.

While the company has been unable to launch, it has been carrying on a
marketing program. "We are looking foreward to bringing a hundred plus
channels of digital audio and video services to places that have never
had that kind of service before," said Chris Franks, ExpressVu's vice
president of regulatory affairs.

'We are just working the last bugs out of our technology and we want to
come to the marketplace with a bullet proof operation. All the other
major DTH/DBS operations around the world have had significant delays.
I don't think we have lost any credibility. We have had over 10,000
calls on our 800 number."

The Commission's decision stated that within six months of the launch
of Canadian DTH services it would hear new applications for DTH
licences. Shaw has said that it will reapply at that time.

Meanwhile StarChoice, owned by Direct Choice of New Brunswick, has
already filed an application for a DTH licence. It plans to receive its
American signals from the just launched Echostar 1.

The company plans to use Echostar receiving equipment. Like Echostar
StarChoice plans to distribute through an established TVRC company,
Walling Communications Corporation.

StarChoice plans to launch by the third quarter of 1996. If the already
licensed services fail to launch quickly, that date will be rolled
back.

ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES DBS, COMPETITION BEGINS

Echostar Communications Corp, successfully launched its high powered
DBS satellite Echostar 1 from China on December 28 and now hopes to be
in the marketplace by late February or early March.

Echostar plans to launch Echostar 2 from China during the summer. The
service will provide over 200 channels of digital video, audio and data
services and become America's second true DBS provider, after DirecTv.

While Primestar offers DTH services, it transmits from a medium powered
satellite restricting its receiving dishes to a now ungainly 30 inches
(76cm). AlphaStar, slated to start service during the first quarter of
1996, will also transmit from a medium powered satellite. True DBS
delivery systems use 18 inch receivers.

Echostar believes that it is in a strong position to compete with the
established American DTH and DBS providers. To begin with it has been
in the TVRO business as a hardware supplier since 1980 and has
operations in Holland, Spain, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia
and India. For the five years ending in 1994, the company captured 25%
of the over 2.1 million DTH units sold in the US.

"We have experience with DTH satellite products and dealers and we have
a very loyal existing base of TVRO dealers that will be our first
distribution path," said an Echostar spokesperson. "We also have the
most advanced technology. We are fully MPEG-2 compliant. DirecTv is
mostly MPEG-2 but in the area of communication between various pieces
of electronic equipment they are not. In addition DirecTv has two
sources of programming, DirecTv and USSB. If you want the full
compliment of cable programming you have to subscribe to both which
creates two bills and two cost centres. That gives us an advantage;
there will be a programming price difference."

While not yet ready to release its marketing or launch plans, Echostar
plans to come into the market at prices below other DBS/DTH providers.
Its prospectus states that the retail cost of an Echostar receiving
system will be in the $500 (#325) range, well below the cost entry
level costs of $700 (#455) for a DirecTV system.

Echostar will also be offering the system for direct sale, purchase
through financing and a leasing option. As far as subscription fees go,
the prospectus states that EchoStar intends to offer customised
packages of programming at prices below current cable and DBS/DTH
services.

"As far as the market goes," said Echostar, "we have seen numbers
anywhere from 12-20 million and we think it is at the high end of that
range. Certainly there is room for three to four players."

DUTCH INVITATION

Dutch junior minister of European Affairs Patijn has invited Belgium
public broadcaster BRTN to join the proposed pan-European Dutch
language satellite channel BVN - best of Dutch TV. Early last Summer
both Radio Nederland Wereldomroep (the Dutch world service radio) and
NOS simultaneously, but independent of each other, launched the idea of
a Dutch public satellite channel to reach the 600,000-odd Dutch living
abroad in Europe. So far, the plan has not materialised, mainly because
of difficulties in funding the project. With the possible co-operation
of the Flemish pubcaster, BVN might get off the ground in 1996.

AN UNCERTAIN LAW

Spain's cable law was finally passed by Parliament on December 15 and
came into effect On January 1. The law seems to satisfy no one, but
everybody agrees that it is much better to have a bad law than no
regulation at all, reports David Del Valle.

The Spanish cable law could have a short life if, as forecast, the
Conservative party (Partido Popular) comes to power in March and
overturns the legislation. Flying in the face of the law, PP is
insisting on putting cable TV cable licences out to tender within its
townships. Now the new law has come into effect there is some doubt
over the powers of the government to overturn licences already awarded
by regional and municipal authorities in PP-governed areas of Spain.

Besides PP's ardent opposition to the law, the Spanish cable bill has
failed to meet the demands of programmers, operators, political parties
and even the Government has voiced its opposition. The law was
introduced to fill a legal vacuum in the cable telecommunications
industry in Spain and to try to put the industry in order. All
political parties (PSOE, IU, CiU and PNV), except the conservatives,
reached a general consensus and decided, despite not being sure about
it, to approve a cable law. "The most important thing is there is a
law", said Miguel Puig, of CiU, who added that there are many things
which now need to be resolved on the technical side. Puig said the law
is too municipalist and is worried that networks awarded by townships
will give rise to "unadvanced networks dedicated only to television".

Puig agreed with programmers and operators that the law "fails to limit
the monopoly held by Telefonica and Canal Plus" and doesn't agree with
the limit of 2 million subscribed homes. The minister of Public Works
and Transport, Jose Borrell, also made his disagreement with this limit
clear and claimed "it will have constitutional problems because it
discriminates, as well as not corresponding with technological
reality". Borrell explained the need of having a cable law, however.
"We have bet on the future, not on the past. We think that this law
will allow the development of cable-based  multi-media services and
broadband networks. If a law had been passed three years ago, it would
have been obsolete by now and wouldn't have been able to meet the
current demands". He attacked PP's move to award cable licences and
calls on the party to "abandon hasty initiatives which are outside the
law, only satisfy political opportunism and which could endanger
investment in and the future of cable". He added, "we will challenge
PP's licence allocations if we consider that they exceed municipal
authority and invade ours (state authority) and if licences are awarded
not just for television, but also telecommunication services."

The Government is to create a regulatory authority responsible for
solving problems and conflicts between programmers and cable operators
which would be composed of administration, operators and programmers.

The president of Telefonica, Candido Velazquez claimed his network will
be "open to any programmers, besides Cablevision (Canal Plus). We will
be in cable wherever possible and we have approached Antena 3, Prensa
Espanola, Grupo Moll and many others". Velazquez, who assured that
"Cablevision will be operating under the same conditions as others"
considers the period of nine months which Telefonica will have to wait
before starting operations as "too long for those who want to have
cable television as soon as possible". In cities where the private
operator has no licence, Telefonica and Canal Plus will have to delay
their plans until their competitor has the correct authorisation.

Programmers, for their part, are also very critical. Eugenlo Galdon,
president of Multitel, the company which recently joined with ABC and
UIH to exploit cable in Spain and Portugal, claimed that this
"conservative" law "benefits Telefonica and Canal Plus, which both have
the monopoly of telephony and pay TV, respectively, in Spain". For him,
"it is very worrying that this law comes to light without the support
of one of the main political parties (Partido Popular)".  Galdon
criticised the limits of each demarcation (50,000 minimum and 2 million
as maximum subscribers). In his opinion, this law gives a lot of
privileges to Telefonica, because it will be able to offer both
telephony and television services, while private operators will be able
to offer only television. "This doesn't promote competition", he
concluded. According to his forecasts, two different scenarios could
take place between years 2000 and 2010 regarding cable penetration and
telephony shares in the hands of cable companies. The first one, which
he described as a good and acceptable situation, indicates, according
to his figures, that in the year 2000 cable penetration might be 20%
and in 2010, around 60%. In this situation, by the year 2000 cable
companies would manage 3% of telephony and in 2010, 20%. The second
one, a failure situation, in 2000 cable penetration would be around 10%
and in 2010, 35%. Regarding telephony, it would be 6%.

Terrestrial channel Antena 3, which has just launched five digital
Channels on Hispasat through a new company called Cable Antena, is very
unhappy with this law and has accused the Government of favouring Canal
Plus. "This law discriminates against programmers in favour of Canal
Plus", complained Manuel Campo Vidal, vice president of Antena 3. He
criticised Telefonica for joining up with Canal Plus which, according
to him, "will act as a gatekeeper which everyone, who wants to offer
his programmes through Telefonica's networks, will have to pass groups
all autonomous channels), Jordi Vila, claims that "our intention is to
be on satellite and there are four televisions (TV3, Canal Sur, ETB and
TVG) interested in it. We will form national or international alliances
to compete".

He also cast doubt on Telefonica's claim that it will have its network
open to everyone. "Canal Plus will determine the encryption system, fix
prices and determine where each channel goes. "Free access to
Telefonica's network is vital, as otherwise the development of cable
will be stopped."

Juan Luis Cebrian, member of the Canal Plus board, replied that 'this
law doesn't have any effect on the agreement between Canal Plus and
Telefonica" and justified the alliance on the need of making huge joint-
ventures to exploit cable.  He added, "according to our forecasts, we
won't make any profit on cable until within 10 years". He made it clear
that pay TV will only mean between 8 and 10% of turnover on cable, with
telephony services the most profitable. Cebrian denied that Cablevision
will act as a gatekeeper and fix prices".

Meanwhile, Cablevision continues its expansion throughout Spain - 16
cities already receive its 41 channels. Subscription to Cablevision
available from the end of the month will cost Pst 2,675 and Pst 6208 if
the subscriber also wants Canal Plus. In Barcelona, Cablevision has
already 2,600 homes connected out of a potential 12,000 homes.

KIDS CHANNELS INCREASE VIEWING SHARES

The success of children's channels helped cable and satellite channels
regain some of their audience share lost in 1994, according to a report
from the ITC. The viewing share for cable and satellite channels
increased from 34.9% to 39.6% between October 1994 and 1995, while
BBC1's share slipped from 24.3% in 1994 to 21.2%.

Children's viewing of cable and satellite channels as a whole accounts
for over half of their total viewing according to the survey conducted
by Continental Research. Some 54.4% of 2 to 15 year olds viewed cable
and satellite channels in 1995, compared with 47.3% in October 1994.
Preference for cable and satellite channels is even more pronounced
amongst younger age groups accounting for 63.9% of viewing among 2 to 9
year olds.

The viewing share for Cartoon Network rose across all individuals from
2% in 1994 to 4.5% in 1995. This share reaches 30.5% among 2 to 9 year
olds.

The recently launched Disney Channel accounts for 1.8% of total viewing
rising to 6.2% of all children's viewing (2 to 15 year olds) and 10.1%
of the younger age group (2 to 9 year olds).

TCC, increased its share from 0.6% in 1994 to 1.3% in 1995 (all
individuals, while its share among children (2 to 15 year olds) rose to
5.1% of all viewing.

DUTCH AD SPEND

For the first time in history spending on TV advertising on Dutch
channels surpassed the one billion guilder mark (#400m). Public
broadcasters are not the beneficiaries of the extra money spent on
commercials - the share of Ster went down from 50% to 35%, while IP
went up top 60%. SBS 6 is expected to take in between 3 and 5%. In real
terms, Ster's 1995 income is down 30 million guilders to 455 million.
IP's income is up to 555 million, mainly because of the arrival of
Veronica as a commercial channel. SBS 6 will take in around 20 million,
while other channels, including Euro 7, Kindernet and local cable
channels will grab 40 million.

PEARSON TUMBLES

Shares in Pearson fell 3.8% after a statement from the company warning

than expected reorganisation costs. Shares closed on Wednesday December
13 at 641p, down 25p from the previous day. Pearson said, however, that
its1995 pretax profit would easily exceed that of previous years,
largely due to proceeds from the September sale of its 9.75% stake in
BSkyB.
