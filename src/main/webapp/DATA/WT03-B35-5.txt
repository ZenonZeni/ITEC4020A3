CALIFORNIA BACKPEDAL
Air Resources Board Favoring Five-Year Delay in ZEV Mandates
In Accord with the Voluntary System Proposed by Automakers

Watch for a delay in zero-emission vehicle sales mandates in
California with two percent in 1998 effectively replaced by
10 percent -- in 2003.
     CARB has ordered its staff to develop a scheme to
replace the original 1998 deadline for meeting a 2-percent
ZEV sales mandate.
     CARB will instead float a plan to have automakers meet
a 10-percent ZEV sales mandate by 2003.
     This approach, to be formally proposed by March,
effectively gives automakers a five-year breather before
meeting ZEV sales goals.
     But the plan will also encourage ZEV introductions as
early as this year, by giving automakers credits, toward the
2003 mandate, for ZEVs brought to market before 1998.
Credits will also be given to ZEVs that use advanced battery
designs.
     Automakers, for their part, pledge to have capacity in
place to make 5,000 EVs in 1996 and 1997, and 14,000 per
year from 1998 until 2003's 10-percent mandate kicks in
(figures spread over the "Big Seven" -- Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors; and Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Toyota).

FEDERAL MILLIONS
ARPA Largesse Expected for Electric Pickup;
$5mm Project by Composite Firm, Partners

Developers of a composite-bodied electric pickup
truck will match expected government funding of
$2.5 million, making for a $5-million overall
effort, says Kerry Hitt, president of Advanced
Composite Products, of Harrisburg, Pa., lead
designer of the vehicle.
     ACP is a composite race car developer. The
new truck is known as the UEV, for utility
electric vehicle.
     Hitt and his partners, including Pennsylvania
Power & Light and other utilities coordinated by
the Pennsylvania Electric Transportation Council
(PETC) now await the formal award of money from
the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Westinghouse Drive

     The prototype UEV includes an electric drive
train from Maryland's Westinghouse.
     ACP plans to build three or four UEVs for
crash testing, hoping to take a crash-certified
final design to an OEM -- "preferably a
Pennsylvania OEM," says Hitt -- for volume
production.
     The UEV chassis is formed by a rectangular
tube structural member which also serves as the
battery storage area. "The reinforcements used in
the chassis area include carbon fiber, chosen for
its structural properties, and glass fiber,
selected for structural and dielectric
properties," ACP says.
     Other composite EV developers, says Hitt,
have "merely substituted materials," using
composites instead of metals. "We have designed
our vehicle around composite materials, around
what they are and what they do," he told F&F.

Shown in Atlanta

     ACP's competitive edge is highly accurate and
consistent fiber orientation, Hitt says. The
company will employ a proprietary fabrication
process, including resin transfer molding, to
build the UEV. The RTM-based process, which
involves dry fiber preforms that approximate the
shape of finished parts, "will cut labor intensity
by up to 80 percent." The UEV design employs epoxy
resins to consolidate the high-strength fibers and
includes both foam and honeycomb core materials.
     The prototype UEV was shown at December's
electric vehicle infrastructure meeting in
Atlanta.

ON LINE AND FOR SALE
Westinghouse Launches Manufacturing
Of EV Drives, Controllers and Chargers

Westinghouse says it's begun series production of
electric vehicle drive trains and related
components, including chargers.
     The company makes 100- and 230-horsepower EV
drives. It numbers Georgia's Blue Bird and China's
Yuanwang Bus Group among its customers for the
larger system, and Ford and Chrysler, for Ranger
pickups and the new Epic minivan (F&F, October 30;
also Chrysler-Epic story on following page of this
issue) for the 100-horsepower system.
     The Chrysler and Ford vehicles will also
employ a 6.0-kilowatt Westinghouse onboard
charger.
     Westinghouse also offers a 135-kilowatt rapid
charge system that uses knowhow from Georgia's
Electronic Power Technology, Inc. (EPTI).
     "Existing prototype systems can recharge
large transit-style electric buses to 80 percent
of capacity in under one hour," Westinghouse says.
     EV component business is organizationally
part of the Westinghouse defense and electronics
businesses that were put up for sale following the
corporation's acquisition of the CBS television
network.

POWER CONTROL
More Federal Support for SatCon:
EV Power Controllers and Flywheels

SatCon Technology Corporation has new federal
support for its ongoing efforts to perfect power
control and flywheel energy storage technology.
New funding is coming from the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and via the ARPA-supported
Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle
Consortium.
     Massachusetts-based SatCon has a Phase I ARPA
contract valued at $100,000 to develop next-
generation modular power controllers for electric
drives and some $200,000 from Electricore for
power management and flywheel-based storage
system.
Leveraging Other Projects
     The Electricore contract carries a total
cost-shared value of $427,000, as SatCon can apply
matching funds of as much as $227,000 from other
development projects.
     Thermal management is the key to SatCon's
power controllers. SatCon has "developed ways to
densely compact these modules and take the heat
out," spokesman Bill O'Donnell told F&F, partly
through the use of advanced materials but also via
proprietary engineering approaches.

IT'S EPIC, BUT WHEN?
Everything But the Release Date
As Chrysler Promotes Fleet Van

"It's aimed at the fleet market," says Chrysler,
and what's more represents "the next logical step
in the development of electric vehicles." The
automaker said at last month's EV infrastructure
meeting in Atlanta that it is ready to build the
Electric Powered Interurban Commuter -- the Epic
-- minivan in Canada, with California a prime
market target.
     But the timetable is a secret.

'Supplier Issues'

     "There are several final supplier issues that
need to be worked through, so we're not ready to
give an exact launch date," Chrysler electric
minivan program executive engineer Bob Feldmaier
said in a statement in Atlanta. But "we've made it
clear," Feldmeier said, "that this vehicle would
be available by the 1998 model year, and that has
not changed."
     Demand is a key factor in establishing a
specific launch date, Chrysler says. "Cost and
range are the two critical market issues that will
shape fleet customer demand," the automaker added.
It is predicting a modest per-charge range of
about 60 miles for the vehicle under "ideal
conditions." The company also says that its
onboard charger will require as much as eight
hours for a complete "fill-up."

Horizon Batteries, Westinghouse Drive

     Chrysler has confirmed that it will use the
lightweight Horizon lead acid battery from
Electrosource in the Epic van, and elsewhere at
the Atlanta gathering endorsed an onboard
conductive charging system that would allow an
electric vehicle to be plugged in for charging
almost anywhere. The new EV is also to employ a
Westinghouse drive train, with a 100 peak-
horsepower AC induction motor, and have a 6.0-
kilowatt Westinghouse charger.
     Chrysler says it's ready to build the Epic
van at its Windsor, Ont. assembly plant "as part
of regular production. No conversion is
necessary." The EPIC model designation will be
applied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager
EV models.
     "Because the minivan is by far our most
successful vehicle, and because it has the unique
ability to work as either a commuter vehicle or a
utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense
to us for electric power," Feldmaier said in
Atlanta.
     "The large flat floor also gives us plenty of
room to store batteries, and more importantly, to
change battery types as new technologies are
developed.
     "Right now we're able to get 27 modules at
about 1,600 pounds onboard of the advanced
[Electrosource Horizon] lead-acid battery. We
anticipate a range of about 60 miles under ideal
conditions with that amount and type of battery."
     The cost and price of the vehicle have also
not been finalized, although Chrysler warns that
"the low-volume componentry and the cost of
batteries" will make the vehicle "significantly
more costly than a comparable gasoline minivan."
Pricing will not be announced until the release
date of the vehicle has been established.
     Chrysler says it will target fleet and
utility customers that have previously purchased
its electric and compressed natural gas vehicles.
     The front-wheel drive Epic van will have a
gross weight of 5,900 pounds with 27 kilowatt-
hours of power, enough for 60 miles without
accessories (the vehicle will include power brakes
and power steering, an AM-FM radio and heat pump
air conditioning and auxiliary electric heating
system, and a rear defrost).
     The Epic minivan will also have a battery
management system and an onboard charging system.

CHARGER SPLIT
Ford, Chrysler Differ with GM
On Conductive Versus Inductive

Detroit's Big Three have another reason to say
that electric vehicles aren't yet ready for market
-- Chrysler and Ford have endorsed direct metal
contact conductive charging couplers while General
Motors prefers the Hughes-developed inductive
paddle connector now marketed by Delco.
     Ford and Chrysler unveiled a prototype metal-
to-metal connector in Atlanta, and said they were
giving meeting participants "a look into the
future."

GM Inductive Deal with Toyota

     GM, meanwhile, has notched an agreement
whereby Toyota gets a license, including
manufacturing rights, to the Delco paddle coupler.
     Ford and Chrysler say they've taken a step
toward needed standardization in the EV industry.
"With EV infrastructure, the goal is to avoid the
VHS versus Beta problems we saw with early video
tape technology," Ford EV program director John
Wallace said in a joint statement.
     "We believe conductive charging is safe and
the most efficient and cost-effective method of
charging," said Chrysler executive engineer Bob
Davis.
     The prototype unveiled in Atlanta was
produced by SCI Systems, described as "the world's
largest contract manufacturer of electronic
assemblies and products." The design, which is to
available to other charger and coupler
manufacturers, is said to have been made to the
specifications of Chrysler and Ford, "five other
major auto manufacturers," the California Air
Resources Board and the Infrastructure Working
Council sponsored by the Electric Power Research
Institute.
     GM-Delco, for its part, claims the support
not only of Chrysler and Ford but of Honda, Mazda,
Nissan and Toyota behind the issuance of a
Recommended Practice for Electric Vehicle
Inductive Charging via the Society of Automotive
Engineers a year ago (F&F, February 6, 1995).

'No Plug-and-Socket'

     "Inductive charging is known for its safety
features and simple operation," says a Delco
release. "The inductive charger has no
conventional metal plug-and-socket connection.
Instead, the user inserts a lightweight,
waterproof plastic paddle into a vehicle's charge
port. This simple action transfers power through a
magnetic field."
     Ford and Chrysler say that their coupler is
safe in all weathers, too.

VOLUME BATTERIES IN FRANCE
It's an Industry Now, Say the French,
As Saft Sets Up Bordeaux Battery Plant

Saft has inaugurated "the world's first plant to
produce electric vehicle batteries in volume" at
Bordeaux in southwest France.
     The big customers for the company's nickel
cadmium batteries are the French automakers PSA
and Renault for the Citroen AX, the Peugeot 106,
and Renault's Clio and Express EVs.
     The $20-million plant will be able to produce
batteries for 5,000 vehicles per year. "Extensions
are planned to meet market growth," says a release
from Saft America (Valdosta, Ga.).
     The French car companies and Saft have had an
agreement on ni-cads since 1992. Saft claims a
service life of 60,000 miles for the advanced
batteries.
     "Ongoing research is focused on nickel-based
batteries for current generation electric vehicles
and lithium-based batteries for vehicles in the
next century," Saft says. "Incremental increases
in battery capability are planned to increase
vehicle range to two-and-a-half times what it is
today."

PSA Peugeot Citroen may be plotting a return to
the U.S. market, according to remarks by chairman
Jacques Calvet reported in The Wall Street
Journal. "He said Peugeot would consider such a
move only if there was a niche his company could
fill," the Journal said on December 19. "[Calvet]
declined to say whether that niche could be an
electric car."

VOLUME BATTERIES IN TEXAS
$80 Million Seen as Potential Value
To Electrosource of Chrysler Order

An order by Chrysler for its Epic electric minivan
will allow Electrosource to ramp up to full OEM
supplier status, the Austin, Texas-based supplier
of Horizon brand lightweight lead-acid batteries
said in Atlanta.
     The Production Purchase Order could lead to
business exceeding a cumulative $80 million over
the next three years, Electrosource says. The
Chrysler PPO also provides cost and delivery terms
for Horizon battery packs for the Epic van. The
first of an expected series of build orders has
already been filled.
     The Horizon battery saves weight by using a
lead-plated glass fiber mesh in lieu of lead
plates. Electrosource claims "the highest peak
power of any battery technology currently
available," noting that independent testing has
pegged specific energy at 44.2 watt-hours per
kilogram, about 50 percent better than that of
traditional lead-acid batteries.

Quick-Charge Capable

     And, "with proper equipment, the Horizon
battery can be recharged as quickly as 30 minutes,
which effectively extends the vehicle's range,"
the company says. Chrysler is believed to favor
the Norvik quick-charge system, though slow-charge
will be standard for the first of the Epic vans.
     "Electrosource has met all of the technical
requirements to qualify the advanced Horizon
battery for use in our electric minivans," Bob
Feldmaier, a Chrysler executive engineer in charge
of the electric minivan program, said in the
Electrosource release.
     "Electrosource's technical staff has helped
our program improve performance by contributing
insights into battery management systems and
advanced charging profiles," Feldmaier said.

NEWT GINGRICH TO THE RESCUE?
Clinton Administration Ducks the LNG Excise Tax Issue
So the NGV and Gas Industry Takes its Case to Congress

It's falling to Congress to save vehicle users of LNG from
taxes that make the clean-burning fuel more expensive than
diesel. The Clinton administration has refused to go to bat
for the NGV industry following an adverse 1995 excise tax
ruling by the Internal Revenue Service (F&F, October 16).
     The American Gas Association and its affiliated Natural
Gas Vehicle Coalition are actively working the problem --
not via the President, as had been planned, but through
Congress.
     "Clinton doesn't want to take on the IRS," says one
industry observer in Washington. And, he says, the overall
government goal of deficit reduction looms as a major
obstacle to reversing the ruling. "The Treasury is not
interested in finding new ways to decrease revenues. The
Treasury wants to tax anything it can get its hands on."
     The NGV advocates' sole ace? Clean-burning LNG would
allow truckers to meet 2004 standards for emissions now, and
the transportation industry could arguably could save money
by doing so if the tax were readjusted.

INSIDE TRACK
EDO Gets a Leg Up with Japanese OEMs
As Fiber Supplier Toray, Sumitomo Buy In

Composite CNG tankmaker EDO Canada has snatched a
major marketing advantage with the huge Japanese
auto sector. The company has notched a deal
making Sumitomo the exclusive distributor of
EDO's LiteRider brand tanks to Japanese OEMs,
worldwide.
     In return, for an aggregate $5,000,000
Canadian (some $3.6 million U.S. at current rates
of exchange), two Sumitomo units and EDO's carbon
fiber-supplier Toray Industries have taken a
combined 16.4-percent stake in EDO's compressed
natural gas cylinder manufacturing operation in
Calgary.

EDO Still Holds the Majority

     The deal modifies the EDO Corporation-
Province of Alberta 60-40 joint-venture ownership
of EDO Canada to give Sumitomo 6.6 percent and
Toray 9.8 percent of the company. New York City-
based EDO Corporation retains the majority share.
     EDO Canada makes LiteRider brand CNG tanks
in Calgary, using polyethylene liners overwrapped
with carbon fiber. Its principal fiber supplier
has been Toray for high-strength T-700 material,
although EDO is working with at least one other
manufacturer, believed to be Hercules.
     [Toray is distinguished in the materials
world as the supplier of toughened epoxy
composite material, made with T-800 carbon fiber,
for the tail and floorbeams of Boeing
Commercial's new 777 widebody jet. The 'triple-7'
is the first American transport aircraft to be
built with composite primary structures.]

Japanese in U.S. the 'First Target'

     The initial EDO Canada deal with Sumitomo
makes Japan's Sumitomo Corporation's Osaka
Machinery Department and New York City's Sumitomo
Corporation of America the exclusive distributors
of LiteRider cylinders to Japanese automotive
manufacturers. Those with car or truck
manufacturing operations in the United States
"are the first target," says EDO Corporation
president Frank Fariello.
     Honda, for example, is promising a natural
gas-powered car for the 1998 model year. And
although the vehicle is to be built in Ohio,
component decisions are expected to be made in
Japan.
     [Prototype Honda NGVs use a two-tank
configuration using all-composite cylinders from
Lincoln Composites. Honda has indicated that it
will shift to one larger cylinder for the
production vehicle.]
     EDO may eventually grant LiteRider
manufacturing rights to its Japanese partners,
although according to Fariello, the establishment
of an NGV industry in Japan awaits regulatory
changes and the building of a fueling
infrastructure there.
     Japanese LiteRider manufacture "is not part
of this deal," the EDO chief told F&F. "That is
subject to additional negotiations."
     "At this time there are no plans for
Sumitomo to manufacture the CNG cylinders in
Japan," says a Sumitomo spokeswoman in New York.
"However, we are leaving our options open for the
future."

A Tank Technical Task Force Too

     The latest arrangement, publicized last
month, establishes a strategic alliance between
EDO, Sumitomo and Toray designed to "accelerate
and expand the alliance's presence in the U.S.
and international NGV market."
     The two Japanese firms get an EDO Canada
board seat. The Toray deal further

 --> sets up an EDO-Toray technical task force
aimed at improving composite CNG tanks with the
primary thrust of "increasing the overall cost-
effectiveness of NGV fuel storage;" and

 --> maintains Sumitomo as the sole distributor of
LiteRider cylinders to Japanese OEMs worldwide.
     "For years, the principal applications of

LNG at LAX
RFP in Preparation for Permanent Station

The Los Angeles International Airport board has
authorized LAX to float a request for proposals
for a permanent liquefied and compressed natural
gas fueling station in support of LAX vehicles.
     The turnkey LNG/CNG fueling station on
airport property near the intersection of
Imperial Highway and Main Street will also be
available to airport and other fleet operators,
and to the public.
     LAX has 14 LNG-powered shuttle buses, with
eight more expected for delivery beginning in
January 1996. The Airports department also
operates 33 CNG-powered utility trucks, pickup
trucks and sedans.
     LNG fuel for the LAX buses is currently
supplied by a temporary station. CNG comes from a
Southern California Gas station on United
Airlines' leasehold.
     The new station "will help the department
meet California's State Implementation Plan as it
applies to civil airports, which is expected to
mirror the federal plan that calls for a major
shift to low-emission vehicles," said executive
director John Driscoll.

FIRST-EVER REBATE
Payment to New York, New Jersey Port
For Three New Vans and a Conversion

New Jersey's Public Service Electric & Gas has
determined its first natural gas vehicle rebate,
a payment of $1,000 per vehicle for four NGVs
placed in service by the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey.
     The Port has bought three new Chrysler NGV
minivans and converted an existing jeep to
natural gas fuel. "The Port Authority's move to
natural gas vehicles is a good business decision
that will eventually save us money by cutting
maintenance and fuel costs," says Port project
manager Sal D'Angelo. The Port will put more NGVs
in service this year.
     The Port uses New Jersey's first public-
access CNG station, a facility put in service
near the Holland Tunnel to New York City as a
joint venture of PSE&G and Shell (F&F, May 15,
1995).
     The PSE&G rebate will be available through
August 1997.

HEAVY HALF DOZEN?
Big Rigs May Make Big Year for LNG
Half a Dozen Truckmakers Offer NGVs

The current excise tax situation has made for
uncertainty (see page 1), but big-rig trucks
represent one alternative fuel vehicle market
that may not be dependent on forced fleet buys or
fuel subsidies, as operators eye economic
advantages to clean-burning liquefied natural gas
fuel.
     Nigh-on half a dozen U.S. manufacturers are
expected to offer dedicated natural gas-powered
medium- and heavy-duty trucks for model year
1996.
     They include Volvo GM, Freightliner, the
affiliates Kenworth and Peterbilt, and possibly
Navistar. The vehicles will be outfitted with
natural gas engines from Navistar, Cummins and
Detroit Diesel.

'Products that Have Been Missing'

     "These new vehicles will give customers the
natural gas products that have been missing from
our portfolio and will play a pivotal role in
boosting NGV industry efforts to more
aggressively target high-fuel-use, medium- and
heavy-duty markets," said Gas Research Institute
product manager Dan Kincaid.
     "The availability of OEM-produced trucks is
a significant development for GRI and the gas
industry, which has cofunded development of NGV
engines," Kincaid said in a GRI statement.
     But "Vehicle manufacturers believe the
success of these trucks will depend on definitive
legislation, customer demand, cost acceptance and
fueling infrastructure," the GRI man cautioned.

NAVISTAR
Navistar, for one, says it's too early to promise
NGVs or natural gas engines for 1996 due to an
absence of federal standards on fuel systems,
particularly for liquefied natural gas. The
Chicago-based company has worked with Detroit
Diesel on modification of Navistar's T444E engine
for natural gas, but says its Class 6-7 Model
4700 truck with a T444NG powerplant isn't quite
ready for market. "Right now it's only available
with the T444E clean diesel," says a Navistar
spokesman. "We take a very conservative
approach," says another company source.
     The T444 is available for natural gas
operation through DDC as the 30G engine.
     [Navistar is also working with other
alternative fuels, including dimethyl ether,
which has been tested in a T444E engine and
according to Navistar "can eliminate exhaust
smoke and greatly reduce other exhaust pollutants
while reducing engine noise. Navistar is working
DME with Amoco and with Haldor Topsoe of Denmark
and AVL List of Germany. Topsoe has a process for
making DME from natural gas, coal, or renewables,
Navistar says.]

865-3484; fax 708-865-3330

KENWORTH
Kenworth Truck Company (Kirkland, Wash.) has the
Class 8 Model T800 and the Class 7 prototype T300
configured for LNG operation. "After the first of
the year is when we really expect to make an
introduction," says Kenworth's Evan Campbell.
Kenworth, Evan Campbell, 206-828-5758; fax 206-

PETERBILT
Peterbilt (Denton, Texas) offers the Model 320
and Model 330 trucks with Cummins L10G and B5.9G
engines for LNG operation.
Peterbilt, Scott Pearson, 817-591-4239; fax 817-

VOLVO GM
Greensboro, N.C.-based Volvo GM Heavy Truck is
offering a refuse hauler, the "Xpeditor," with a
Cummins L10-300G natural gas engine available in
LNG and CNG versions. The NGV Xpeditor was
unveiled in mid-1995 making "Volvo GM Heavy Truck
the first Class 8 truck manufacturer to offer
natural gas engines as a factory option."
Volvo GM, Dave Schrader, 910-393-2847; fax 393-
2277

FREIGHTLINER
Freightliner Corporation of Portland, Ore. also
unveiled a natural gas-powered vehicle in mid-
1995: the FL 60 business class truck with a
Cummins B5.9G (5.9-liter) engine.
     The company now offers an even wider range
of LNG-powered trucks, including the Class 5
FL50, the Class 7 FL70, and the Class 8 FL106,
FLD112, FLD112SD, FLD120, and FLD120SD models.
     Engine options include the Cummins B5.9G and
L10G and the 50G and 60G from Detroit Diesel.
     Freightliner Custom Chassis (Gaffney, S.C.)
offers the Class 3 Model MT-12FNG with a Hercules
3.7-liter or Cummins B5.9G engine.
     The MT-12FNG is designed for the postal
service, which according to GRI may buy as many
as 500 of the CNG-powered units this fiscal year.
Freightliner, Bill Thomas, 503-735-8896
Freightliner Custom Chassis, 803-488-8604

CUMMINS
Besides the well known L10G and B5.9G, Cummins
late last year promoted its first 8.9-liter
natural gas-fueled engine, the C8.3G, with
availability this first quarter of 1996. The 250-
horsepower C8.3G is available with torque ratings
of 660 and 750 pound-feet at 1,400 rpm. The six-
cylinder engine is aimed at bus and truck
markets.

CLEAN FUEL CORRIDOR
Diverse Groups Team in California
For Clean Vehicle Fueling Facilities

A California consortium is claiming to be the
first in the nation to offer private motorists a
Clean Fuels Corridor stretching across two big
southern counties: San Bernadino and Riverside.
     Fuels covered at 15 sites include CNG and
LNG, as well as electric vehicle charging.
     New natural gas fueling sites in Ontario,
Riverside, Temecula and Joshua Tree will
supplement some 77 CNG sites, about half of them
public, currently in service in Southern
California.
     Consortium members include Southern
California Gas, Southern California Edison,
United Parcel Service and local governments.
     The project has just under $750,000 in
vehicle registration funds and nearly $1.2
million from private parties including consortium
members, Applied LNG Technologies, Mesa Pacific,
Amendt Oil and Lapis Energy.

Ford has turned out the first two prototype
Ranger pickup gliders from its assembly line in
Edison, N.J. "The purpose of building these
prototypes was to learn how to move a glider most
efficiently through an assembly plant without
disrupting normal production," Ford EV marketing
manager Mike McCabe said in a statement. TDM
Worldwide Conversions is building a plant in
Kansas for the installation of electric drives in
the trucks (F&F, October 30). TDM is shooting for
Qualified Vehicle Modifier status, meaning that
Ford will warranty EV trucks from the Kansas
plant. TDM has not yet gotten the QVM nod because
"until that plant is built, Ford can't audit it,"
says TDM project manager Bill Coppola. He notes
that TDM has already secured QVM status for Ford
NGV conversions. "We've seen the drill," Coppola
told F&F. "We've done it." TDM, Bill Coppola,

German postal authorities have kicked off their
test of the zinc-air battery system from Israel's
Electric Fuel, taking delivery last month of half
a dozen EVs and staging a ribbon-cutting ceremony
for Electric Fuel's zinc regeneration facility in
Bremen. The Electric Fuel system uses replaceable
zinc cassettes in lieu of conventional battery
charging. The test by Deutsche Post, the largest
mail service in Europe, will involve 64 vehicles,
among them Mercedes-Benz MB410E vans and Corsa
Combo pickups from GM Opel. Three of each have
now been delivered. The German postal and
telephone companies may eventually purchase
25,000 and 15,000 EVs each, Electric Fuel says.
