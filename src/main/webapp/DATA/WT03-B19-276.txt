The Northern Victoria Region includes a broad spectrum of topographic
and climatic zones. Economic activity varies between the higher
rainfall and forested Great Dividing Ranges in the south, and
the irrigated Murray River farmland in the north.
<P>
The City of Greater Bendigo is the largest centre in the region
and one of Victoria's largest and most important provincial centres.
<P>
The Northern Region of Victoria also covers the main industrial
centres of Mildura (in the Sunraysia), Castlemaine, Swan Hill,
Echuca, and Maryborough. Information on Bendigo's industrial strengths
and of the other larger centres in Northern Victoria and the districts
that surround them is provided in this regional profile.
<P>
In addition to the larger industrial centres, Northern Victoria
covers towns such as Kyneton, Robinvale, Rochester, Cohuna, Kerang,
Pyramid Hill, Boort, St Arnaud, Donald, Charlton and Wycheproof,
each of which has significant industrial features.
</FONT>
<H2>Kyneton</H2>
<P>
Kyneton, in the south of the region, has succeeded in developing
tourism, and has attracted a variety of unique manufacturers.
 Kyneton Fine China, for example, produces high quality ceramic
china for export.  The area surrounding Kyneton is well known
for mineral water and quality hardwood.
<H2>Robinvale</H2>
<P>
Robinvale is one of northern Victoria's growing &quot;river towns&quot;.
 Robinvale's manufacturing industries, headed by Robinvale Cooperative,
are developing rapidly.  The Cooperative is planning major expansion
into world markets in dried fruits and other horticultural products.
<P>
Other rapidly growing industries in the area around Robinvale
include almond growing, grape growing and wineries.
<H2>Rochester</H2>

<P>
Due to the availability of gravity fed irrigation, a number of
Northern Region communities, including Rochester, have developed
intensive agriculture and produce a variety of products.  Rochester
is a service centre for a major dairy industry and is the base
for a Murray Goulburn manufacturing plant.
<H2>Cohuna and Kerang</H2>
<P>
The lush dairy pastures surrounding
the Murray River town of Cohuna provide the raw materials for
the Leitchville Kraft Cheese factory, which is another major dairy
product manufacturer in the Northern Region.
<P>
Kerang, to the north-west of Cohuna, also supports the dairy industry
and is the base for major graziers producing fat lambs and top
quality beef cattle.  There are also small salt mining operations.
<H2>Pyramid Hill</H2>

<P>
The town of Pyramid Hill has shown an amazing ability for growth.
 Pyramid Hill Pet Food is a rapidly expanding manufacturer producing
for the entire Australian market and exporting to South East Asia.
<H2>Boort</H2>

<P>
Like Pyramid Hill, Boort is located in the Shire of Gordon irrigation
district.  The well known firm Hy-Cube regularly provides complete
train loads of containerised lucerne cubes for export to Japan.
<H2>Donald, Charlton, Wycheproof</H2>

<P>
Donald, Charlton, Wycheproof and other towns in the south-west
Mallee-Wimmera area are support centres for Victoria's major grain
growing areas.
<H2>St Arnaud</H2>

<P>
St Arnaud is also a service centre for grain and is the base for
manufacturers such as Goldfields Turkeys, Gold Acres Farm Sprays
and Melban Pty Ltd, a pet food raw material manufacturer.
