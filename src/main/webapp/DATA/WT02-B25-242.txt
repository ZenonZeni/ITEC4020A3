<P>
"Schizophrenia from Mind to Molecule" is a collection of thirteen
essays--some highly technical--that provides a comprehensive and
authoritative picture of the current state of schizophrenia
research.  It is divided into five sections dealing with human
experience, phenomenology, neurobiology, treatment, and the
molecular basis for the disease.
<P>
Although most of the book will be of primary interest to 
psychiatrists and brain scientists, the first three chapters
are quite accessible to family members.  Dr. Martin Willick
writes movingly from the perspective of a psychiatrist who
is also the parent of a schizophrenic son; Laurie Flynn of NAMI
succinctly summarizes the enormous social, economic, and family
costs of schizophrenia and proposes policy solutions aimed
at providing appropriate care and treatment; and Dr. John Strauss
looks at the need for balance between the psychosocial and
neurobiological aspects of the disease.
<P>
Although most of the remaining ten chapters go into considerable
detail about the specialized research underway in the primary
areas addressed in the five sections of the book, "Schizophrenia
from Mind to Molecule" is recommended as a resource for affiliate
libraries.
<P>
Note:  This book can be purchased through your local bookstore or
may be on loan through your public library.

<A NAME = "thema"><H2>"THE MAD AMONG US"</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Complete Title:  "The Mad Among Us:  A History of the Care of
America's Mentally Ill<P>
Gerald Grob, professor of the history of medicine at Rutgers
University, is the leading historian of the treatment of mental
illness in the United States.  "The Mad Among Us:  A History of
the Care of America's Mentally Ill" draws on a lifetime of
research and four earlier volumes that cover various periods and
aspects of his subject.  Authoritative (with extensive notes for
each chapter) yet readable, the entire book will be interesting
to NAMI members with a flair for history.  The last third,
however, covering the period from the end of World War II to the
present, is "must" reading for those who want to understand the
system we deal with in our daily lives.  Throughout, the book is
humane and compassionate as it illustrates the irony of deep
social concern coexisting with the unmet needs of persons with
serious mentally illnesses.
<P>
The first two-thirds of the book covers care of the mentally ill
in families in colonial times; notes the first mental hospital
that opened in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1767; and discusses the
development of asylums and public mental hospitals in the 19th
century.  Institutions soon came to be understaffed and
overcrowded, and patients were often neglected and badly treated.
<P>
Mental hospital reform was a continuing issue in public policy,
spearheaded by Dorothea Dix in the l850s to l870s.  As psychiatry
developed, it long remained associated with mental hospitals and
became independent only in this century.  Treatment theories
informed the practice of care:  always professionals searched for
a treatment that would cure patients and allow them to leave
hospitals and lead normal, independent lives.
<P>
NAMI members' interest in "The Mad Among Us" will probably
quicken in the last third of the book, which traces developments
since 1945 when the locus of treatment shifted from the hospital
to the community.  The central theme is the key role of the
federal government.  The Social Security Act of 1935 was amended
in 1965 to set up Medicare and Medicaid; in l956 to provide
disability benefits (SSDI); and in l972 to provide income support
(SSI). These amendments soon covered the mentally ill and infused
large amounts of federal funds into their care and treatment.
Other legislation provided federal leadership in shaping the
concept of community care: the National Mental Health Act in
1946, the Mental Retardation and Community Mental Health Centers
Construction Act of 1963, and its extension in 1975.  The Mental
Health Systems Act of October 1980 was repealed in 1981 and block
grants to the states were initiated--reversing "nearly three
decades of federal involvement and leadership" (p. 287).  As a
result, the care and treatment of the mentally ill became
fragmented.
<P>
NAMI members know well the failures of the community care
concept. Levels of funding for community health centers were
always low, and the centers were slow to accept the need for
supportive services for the mentally ill that must accompany
treatment.  In addition, as the centers expanded their work with
persons with emotional problems, those with serious mental
illnesses were crowded out.  
<P>
In the l960s, l970s, and l980s, mental hospitals discharged
increasing numbers of patients to communities that were usually
poorly equipped to help them.  Some became homeless.  By the late
1970s, large numbers of young mentally ill persons--never
hospitalized--were suffering also from alcoholism and drug abuse.
<P>
NIMH's Community Support Program in 1977 and the State
Comprehensive Mental Health Service Plan Act in 1986 supported
efforts by the states to integrate federal entitlement programs
and community services for seriously mentally ill persons.  Other
privately funded efforts have been undertaken nationally; and, as
NAMI members know, innovative programs that combine treatment and
psychosocial services have proliferated in states and
communities. Such programs often reduce the need for
hospitalization and foster a better quality of life.  The author
applauds the advocacy of NAMI in the 1980s and 1990s in support
of these developments in services.
<P>
A minor theme interwoven with the central theme is based on the
changes since 1945 in the theories that underlie treatment. 
Seldom seen today is the practice of making early interventions
in emotional difficulties that was based on a "continuum theory"
of mental disorders (meaning that they begin with emotional
difficulties and end with chronic mental disease).  The advent of
psychotropic drugs and the findings of brain research have
challenged psychoanalytic theory and given treatment leadership
to biological psychiatry.  Increasingly, treatment deals with the
psychiatric and the human needs of the seriously mentally ill.
<P>
These reviewers feel that Professor Grob does not give adequate
emphasis to the giant leap forward in scientific research into
the brain that has revolutionized the understanding of serious
mental illnesses in the last decade.  This research is largely
the result of the impact of the research budget of NIMH.  The
author thus inadvertently understates the role of NAMI's
advocacy, inasmuch as we have been a leading advocate of brain
research.  The policy debate is still going on, but NAMI members
can be heartened that today biological psychiatry gives the
debate a scientific foundation.
<P>
What does all this history teach us as we continue to grope as a
nation for wisdom when dealing with serious mental illness?   Two
lessons are clear:  we must be more realistic in our anticipation
of what public policy can achieve, and we must be more humble
about our knowledge of the complex issues serious mental
illnesses raise.  The following are some thoughts of Professor
Grob:
<P>
The community mental health policy proved no less problematic
than its institutional predecessor.
<P>
If American society is to deal effectively, compassionately, and
humanely with the serious mentally ill, we must acknowledge that
this group includes individuals with quite different disorders,
prognoses, and needs, the outcome of which varies considerably
over time.
<P>
We must also confront the evidence that serious mental disorders
are often exacerbated by other social problems of a nonmedical
nature--poverty, racism, and substance abuse.  Although
psychiatric therapies can alleviate symptoms and permit
individuals to live in the community, there is no magic that will
cure all cases of serious mental illnesses.[Mental illnesses] can strike at any time and among all elements
of the population.  The ensuing impact on the individual, family,
and society is immense, for it often leads to disability and
dependency.  Treatment does not necessarily eliminate the
disorder.[We must not be discouraged in our efforts] to find ways to
alleviate some of the adverse consequences of illness...[and to
assist] seriously ill persons in coping with and managing their
condition.
<P>
The severely mentally ill have a moral claim upon our sympathy,
compassion, and, above all, upon our assistance.

Adverse Effects of Psychotropic Drugs by John M. Kane, MD,
Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, and Oliver G. Cameron, MD, PhD
Published by Guiliford Press, 1993.  511 pp  $60.00
<P>
Twenty years ago, Shader and DiMascio edited "Psychotropic Drug
Side Effects."  A great deal has happened in psychopharmacology
in the intervening 20 years (for example, development of the
specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors,and recognition of the
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and tardive dyskinesia), and a new
book on side effects, adverse effects of psychopharmacological
agents is very timely.  Thus, the recently published edited
volume by Drs. Kane, Lieberman, and Cameron is quite welcome.
<P>
This is a book written for and by physicians, mainly clinical
psychopharmacologist; over 90 percent of the contributing authors
are MDs or DOs.
<P>
The subject matter and level of detail are directed at
practitioners who are specialists in the therapeutic use of
psychotropic agents.  Most of the authors are from the United
States, especially from New York and Massachusetts, but a few are
from the United Kingdom and Ireland.
<P>
There are 3 major sections in the book, titled "General Issues,"
"Side Effect Profiles of Psychotropic Drugs," and "Special
Populations."
<P>
The general issues section focuses on pre- and post-marketing
evaluations of drug safety, drug-drug interactions, abuse
potential, and informed consent, while the section on special
populations addresses problems primarily related to children and
geriatric patients.
<P>
In the section on side effect profiles, there are 5 subsections:<br>
(1) "Behavioral Effects," <br>
(2) "Neuromuscular Effects," <br>
(3) "Cardiovascular Effects," <br>
(4) "Convulsive Effects," and <br>
(5) "Endocrine Effects." <br>
<P>
The chapters in the subsection on behavioral effects are arranged
around types of drugs--antidepressants and lithium, neuroleptics,
benzodiazepines, and psychostimulants.
<P>
Most of the neuromuscular side effects of psychotropic are due to
the antipsychotics; however, there is also a welcome chapter
included on these effects due to antidepressants and lithium.  
<P>
The cardiovascular effects subsection focuses on the effects of
antidepressants -- heterocyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
while the subsection on convulsive effects deals with several
classes of drugs in a single chapter.
<P>
The subsection on endocrine effects actually deals with more than
just endocrine issues, and is thus somewhat inappropriately
named; in addition to chapters on endocrine, metabolic, and
nutritional effects, and on reproductive and sexual, there are
chapters on hematologic, immune system, gastrointestinal and
hepatic and genitourinary.  
<P>
The authors provide the reader with numerous useful tables,
figures and references. The 15-page index is very helpful. 
Because of its focus, length and detail, the subsection on
neuromuscular effects might be the best and most useful in the
book, especially since these adverse effects are often very
problematic and not as routinely recognized by clinicians as they
should be.
<P>
The typical member of NAMI is likely to find this book not "all
you wanted to know," but much more than that, and at a level of
technical detail which is likely to make many parts of the volume
not understandable to someone not clinically trained in this
area. 
<P>
But knowing that this information is now easily available in an
up-to-date version is important to anyone who has an interest in
the optimal care of individuals on psychotropic medications.
<P>
You might not read this book yourself, but you will want to know
where you can find the wealth of knowledge contained in it, and
you will want to be sure that the prescribing physician does too!

<A NAME = "anint"><H2>AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. TORREY</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
An interview with E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., author of Surviving Schizophrenia:  A Manual for Families, Consumers and Providers, Third Edition.  
<P>
How is your new edition of Surviving Schizophrenia different from the previous ones?
<P>
The third edition of Surviving Schizophrenia is as different from the second edition as its green cover is different from the orange cover on the older edition.  Even the subtitle of the book has been changed from "A Family Manual" to "A Manual for Families, Consumers and Providers."
<P>
I have especially reorganized the practical aspects of the book so that readers can more readily pick out what they are looking  for. For example, Chapter 9 is entitled "Six Major Problems" and has sections on 1) Cigarettes and Coffee; 2) Alcohol and Street Drugs; 3) Sex, Pregnancy, and AIDS; 4) Medication Noncompliance; 5) Assaultive and Violent Behavior; and 6) Suicide.
<P>
Chapter 10 is "Questions Asked by Consumers and Families," and it has sections such as "Should People with Schizophrenia Drive Motor Vehicles?" "How Can Relapses Be Reduced?" and "How Do Religious Issues Affect People with Schizophrenia?"
<P>
I have also included more practical information on resources.   There is a six-page listing of the most useful videotapes, compiled by Mrs. Katie Petray, as well as a listing of available courses forgetting education on schizophrenia.  
<P>
My favorite section continues to be the annotated "Readings on Schizophrenia," which has been expanded to include "The 15 Best and the 15 Worst."   Some old favorites and unfavorites are joined by new nominees, including some outstanding books and also some that are truly dreadful.
<P>
What are some of the positive changes that have taken place in the last 12 years in how we view and treat this disease?
<P>
The two most exciting changes that have taken place in the past 12 years have been advances in research and a decrease in stigma.   We know much more about schizophrenia as a brain disease, as I summarize in Chapter 6, "What Causes Schizophrenia?"  
<P>
Increased research funds from NIMH, NARSAD, the Theodore and Vada Stanley Foundation, and the Scottish Rite have merged with rapidly improving technology for studying the brain to produce a veritable stream of research developments, and this stream is accelerating.   It is really an exciting time from a research point of view.
<P>
The decrease in stigma has come largely through public education..  NAMI members at the local level (for example, teaching a class at a local school) and at the national level are largely responsible for this decrease in stigma.  
<P>
However, the single largest factor in decreasing stigma has been the willingness of individuals who have been affected with schizophrenia to go public and talk about their experiences in newspaper interviews, books, radio, television, and videotapes.  We owe a great debt to these individuals, such as Fred Frese, Lori Schiller, Esso Leete, Carol North, Brandon Fitch, and the others.
<P>
Is anything surrounding this disease or its treatment actually worse now than it was a decade ago?
<P>
There is no question that public services, overall, are worse than a decade ago.  More individuals with schizophrenia are living in public shelters and on the streets; more of them are in jails (usually on misdemeanor charges); more of them are living in very marginal group homes; and more of them are living in questionable nursing homes. 
<P>
For many reasons, which I detail in Chapter 1, "Dimensions of the Disaster," deinstitutionalization has been carried out very poorly and is the largest single failed social experiment in twentieth-century America.  We are so used to the mediocre services that we forget how bad they are.
<P>
For that reason I included a new section in the book on "Examples of Good Services" and listed (with an accompanying map) the best clubhouses, the best continuous treatment teams, and the best community mental health centers and comprehensive treatment programs.
<P>
The other troublesome question that has recently arisen--and which I discuss in the book--is whether the incidence of schizophrenia is increasing in the United States.  There is recent data suggesting that it may be.  If this is indeed true, then our problems with services are going to get even larger.
<P>
How will consumers and families be helped by your book?  Overall, what does it offer them that they have trouble obtaining otherwise?
<P>
Surviving Schizophrenia offers families, consumers, and providers one-stop shopping.  In a single book an answer can be found to almost any question that may arise, from the history of schizophrenia to a list of the best journals to read to keep up on the research developments.  
<P>
My model for the book is Dr. Benjamin Spock's Baby and Child Care, which is so widely used because it tells mothers everything they need to know in a single volume.  The third edition of  Surviving Schizophrenia has a markedly expanded table of contents (five pages) and index (17 pages) so that readers can quickly find whatever they need.  
<P>
In that sense, Surviving Schizophrenia is the type of book that you keep around and pick up to read specific sections.  It's not a book that you read once through then put on the shelf.
<P>
What is the most often asked question about schizophrenia from someone such as a family member who has just learned that a loved one has the disorder.  What is your answer?  The most often asked question is the obvious one:  What can be done?  And my response to it is to emphasize the importance of finding a competent psychiatrist and the importance of starting antipsychotic medication as quickly as possible.  I detail this in Chapter 7, "The Treatment of Schizophrenia."  
<P>
The next most often asked question is frequently asked indirectly:   "Did I cause my relative to become sick?"  Those of us who are familiar with research on schizophrenia sometimes forget how many people are not familiar with it.
<P>
Family members often assume that they played some role in causing their relative's disease.  I explain that they played no more role in causing the schizophrenia than they would if their relative had developed Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis--in other words, no role whatsoever.
<P>
If the family of a person with schizophrenia remembers just one major point made in your book--holds onto just one message--what would you like it to be?  If the consumer remembers just one point, what would you like it to be?
<P>
For the family, I would ask them to read Chapter 2, "The Inner World of Madness," and realize how difficult life is for individuals with schizophrenia.  People with schizophrenia are often heroic in their efforts to control their voices and delusional thinking and to lead normal lives.   
<P>
For the consumer, I would ask him or her to read Chapter 11, "How to Be an Advocate," and parts of Chapter 10, such as "How Can Consumers Survive Schizophrenia?"  If they remember just one point, I would like it to be the increasing role that consumers themselves are playing in advocacy efforts and in delivering services to other individuals who are affected with this disease.  
<P>
Perhaps the best examples are the consumer provider (also called consumer case manager) training programs listed in Appendix C.  Consumers are playing an increasing role in services, and this is exciting progress.
