 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter.  The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals. These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and concentrated tissue nutrients  in  select  products.  By  combining  modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITION FOR THE EYES</H2>
<P>  Life  Plus  EYE  FORMULA  is  formulated  to nutritionally support the tissues of the eyes and other tissues.  Every year millions of people lose their sight to conditions such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts and retinal hemorrhages.</P>
<P>  Few people stop to think how our eyes are bombarded each day by air pollution, chemicals, drugs, certain cosmetics, fumes from solvents and cigarette smoke. Thus, it is imperative that we support our eyes nutritionally, if we want to use them for a whole lifetime.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NIGHT BLINDNESS AND VITAMIN A</H2>
<P>  One of the most common vision problems people have today is night blindness.  Vitamin A is actually a cure for this condition. EYE FORMULA contains 500 international units of Vitamin A in its natural precursor form, Beta-Carotene.  Ideally, more should be taken for this specific application, but only 500 international units are included in EYE FORMULA to not over supplement for individuals who are obtaining it from other supplements. However, the representative amount in EYE FORMULA ensures that it is present and available to the eyes when the other nutrients in this great product are present to provide its synergistic effect.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CIRCULATION AND EYES</H2>
<P>  Most eye problems associated with degeneration are related to circulation impairment in some way.   The decrease in blood supply is responsible for a lack of both oxygen and needed nutrients reaching our tissues.  In addition, end products of metabolism can build up and result in toxemia.   This  situation can be especially damaging to the eyes as oxygen levels are very critical to their delicate tissues. It has been shown, for instance, that decreased levels of Glutathione in the ocular tissues are associated with the existence of cataracts.</P>
<P>  The Eyebright herb in Life Plus EYE FORMULA is a very important ingredient and has been used as a valuable nutritional supplement for years, especially in Europe.  It has not only been taken whole, but made into tinctures, fluid extracts and even poultices that were applied topically.</P>
<P>  Bioflavonoids are compounds that occur in nature with Vitamin C. The Rutin and Hesperidin contained in Life Plus EYE FORMULA are known to  help maintain the integrity of the thousands of tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, in the eye. These two specific bioflavonoids are known to be especially beneficial for the eyes.</P>
<P>   Macular degeneration is a condition of the eyes that is characterized by a gradual decreased ability to see. Eyebright herb and Vitamin A combined with improved circulation can be very helpful.  Eyebright herb and the natural tri-peptide, Glutathione, is a unique synergistic nutritional  supportive  combination  for  the  eyes. Glutathione is a special natural substance that is present in all  normal  cells, especially ocular tissue that contain sulfur.   It is a great anti-oxidant and detoxifier and is thought to be helpful in the prevention of cataracts. Concentrated tissue nutrients from bovine ophthalmic and brain tissues are also included for their overall synergistic effects in the nutritional support for the healthy metabolic processes of eye tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  EYE FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>
