<h1>Vaporization of Cannabinoids: a Preferable Drug Delivery
Route </h1>

<p> <b>Oral vs Inhaled</b> </p>

<p> While cannabis used medicinally has generally utilized the
oral route, certain difficulties have been recognized since its
introduction to western medicine by O'Shaughnessey in 1839. The
most common entry in the Surgeon General's List, 19th century
precursor to the Indicus Medicus described overdose. While not
physically harmful, the mental effects were alarming. </p>

<p> While the oral cannabis ingestion using gradual upward
titration may take days, oral cannabis' absorbtion rates vary,
depending on motility and contents of the gastrointestinal tract.
Inhaled cannabis by contrast produces much more rapid onset of
effect (within minutes compared with hours), reliable effect, and
accurate autotitration. </p>

<p> The current use of cigarette or pipe for the inhaling of
cannabinoids is recognized as delivering numerous irritants and
possible carcinogens along with the desired active principles to
the tracheobronchial tree and oral cavity. Vaporization separates
out the more therapeutic chemical components from the crude plant
or resin impurities and breakdown products of pyrrolysis. </p>

<p> The vaporization temperature range is significantly below the
flash point and pyrrolytic temperature of cannabinoids and
non-cannabinoid components of crude cannabis. </p>

<p> There are some 421 identified compounds in cannabis, 61 of
which are cannabinoids. All of these compounds are pyrrolyzed
into numerous degradation products which are delivered to the
respiratory tract through the process of smoking.** </p>

<p> Any mitigation of irritation to the oral cavity and
tracheobroncheal tree in the delivery of active principles of
cannabis- especially in the chronic marijuana user would be
inherently safer. For the immunocompromised, debilitated, or in
respiratory distress possibly life saving. </p>

<p> A program to study the physical and therapeutic properties
including asthma which would utilize the therapeutic properties
of the drug without the drawback of the irritation to the lungs. </p>

<p> Systematic evaluation of specific vaporization temperature
ranges is required to better differentiate and characterize the
optimal combinations of cannabinoids for different symptoms and
conditions. </p>

lists the boiling point of delta 1,9 Tetrahydrocannabinol as 200
degrees centigrade. </p>
