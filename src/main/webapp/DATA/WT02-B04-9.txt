<P>
<CENTER><B> SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
 These <I>amici</I> submit that this Court should interpret, construe,
and declare the indecency sections of the CDA as constitutional,
valid, and enforceable.  Failure to recognize the power of Congress
to extend reasonable protections for minor children to interactive
computer services, including the Internet, would result in a serious
departure from established law and cause a fundamental reversal
in the way in which law and society handle children's access to
pornography.  
<P>
 The District Court below misinterpreted the indecency test to
be so broad that it could reach virtually any sexual speech, regardless
of its specific context, purpose, or intent, and thus made the
CDA appear unconstitutional. 
<P>
 <I>Amici</I> ask this Court to properly interpret the CDA as
adopting a narrow test for indecency that does not reach serious
expression that should be protected for adults, and thereby recognize
its constitutionality.  
<P>
 This Court should find that the indecency standard, as tailored
to this medium of communication, is a facially valid test for
identifying patently offensive representations of sexual and excretory
acts and organs that should be restricted from children and would
not, in context, restrict legitimate, serious sexual works.  Congress
adopted a medium specific standard for online indecency and this
Court can recognize that the scope of such indecency for the CDA
does not restrict materials that are worthy of protection online.
 Judgments as to specific violations, defenses, compliance methods,
or the nature of particular communications are evidentiary, as
applied, factual considerations that should be reserved for case-by-case
contextual analysis in actual cases or controversies. 
<P>
The District Court created, in effect, a previously nonexistent
license to knowingly send indecent pornography directly to known
children and to knowingly display it to minor children on computer
networks without taking any good faith steps to restrict it from
their access.  If allowed to stand, this ruling would force this
nation's federal and state legislatures to surrender their compelling
interests in protecting children from pornography, in favor of
the economic interests and ideological wishes of computer pornography
providers, leaving them unburdened and untroubled even by reasonable
responsibilities for their pornography reaching children.  This
result is being increasingly exacerbated by the uniquely pervasive
nature of the medium and the growing accessibility that America's
children have to interactive computer networks, both at home and,
more often, outside the home and outside parental control.  This
unique accessibility to children will only increase with the Government's
incentives for helping schools provide Internet access to all
students, and with libraries providing free, unsupervised Internet
access to children of all ages. 
<P>
Adults should not be granted an absolute First Amendment right
to use the Internet to knowingly send or make indecency available
to minor children, just as they cannot use billboards or magazine
racks to knowingly sell or display pornography to minor children.
 Indecent material may be protected expression among adults, as
this Court has said, but indecent and harmful material is not
necessarily protected from restriction when disseminated to children,
as this Court has also said.  
<P>
The focus of this Court should not be on whether adults who wish
to show patently offensive sexual or excretory depictions would
find it bothersome to restrict them from minors.  Instead, this
Court must decide whether the provider of such patently offensive
material should be relieved of all burden of making any good faith
effort to restrict his indecency from children, in light of the
compelling interest that government and all of society have in
protecting minor children from premature exposure to patently
offensive pornography.
<P>
 <I>Amici</I> suggest that three actions should be taken by the
Court in this appeal from the preliminary injunction:
<P>
1.  Reverse the unprecedented decision below that this Court's
test for indecency and patent offensiveness is unconstitutionally
vague and overbroad and uphold the CDA as adopting the medium
specific, constitutionally valid test of online indecency for
telecommunications devices and for the Internet and other interactive
computer services.
<P>
 2.  Reverse the decision below that 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223 (a)(1)(B)
and (a)(2) are invalid for using the standard of indecency and
uphold this section as creating a valid offense of knowingly using
a telecommunications device to send indecent messages directly
to a known, minor recipient.
<P>
 3.  Reverse the decision below that 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223 (d)(1)
and (d)(2) are facially invalid in all respects and make four
separate findings:  (1) uphold subsection (d)(1)(A) as creating
a valid offense of using an interactive computer service to knowingly
send online indecency to a specific minor;  (2) uphold subsection
(d)(1)(B) as creating a valid offense of knowingly displaying
online indecency in a manner available to minors on commercial
sites or services, without taking good faith steps under available
technology to restrict access by minors to such indecency;  (3)
uphold subsection (d)(1)(B) as creating a facially valid offense
as to persons who knowingly display online indecency in a manner
available to minors without taking any good faith steps under
available technology to restrict access by minors to such indecency;
and  (4) uphold (d)(2) as creating a valid offense as to interactive
computer service owners and operators who knowingly permit the
facilities under their control to be used for the known sending
of indecent material to specific minors or for the known display
of indecency in a manner that is available to minors, without
taking any available good faith action to restrict it from minors.
 
<P>
<I>Amici</I> also submit that the record of the preliminary injunction
hearing below does not conclusively establish that pornography
distributors cannot take reasonably effective steps online to
restrict their indecency from children while making it available
to adults and was, therefore, incomplete, inaccurate, and misleading.
 The seriousness of striking down the Act's provisions without
complete discovery and full disclosure of facts concerning technically
feasible and possible technologies for compliance with the CDA
would at least warrant a remand for reconsideration and a rehearing
or trial on the merits, rather than an affirmance on this record.

<P>
<CENTER><B>LAW AND ARGUMENT<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>I. THE CDA'S INDECENCY TEST IS A VALID AND PROPER STANDARD
TO SEPARATE PROTECTED SPEECH FROM &quot;ONLINE INDECENCY&quot;
THAT IS UNPROTECTED FOR MINOR CHILDREN.<BR>
</B>
<P>
In its Conference Report on the CDA, Congress described the offenses
added by the Act to protect minor children from online indecency,
<I>see</I> Conf. Rep. at 188, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02:
<P>
New subsection 223(d)(1) applies to content providers who send
prohibited material to a specific person or persons under 18 years
of age.  Its &quot;display&quot; prohibition applies to content
providers who post indecent material for online display without
taking precautions that shield that material from minors. &#133;
Defenses to violations of the new sections assure that attention
is focused on bad actors and not those who lack knowledge of a
violation or whose actions are equivalent to those of common carriers.
<P>
 The District Court below found the CDA unconstitutional on its
face for two main reasons, separately discussed by each of the
three judges sitting on the panel.  The first was that the test
for &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;patent offensiveness&quot;
was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and would totally ban
indecent speech for adults and some speech protected even as to
minors.  The second was that the CDA was not a least restrictive
means because existing protocols and practices on the Internet,
Usenet, and World Wide Web made compliance difficult or impossible
for potential providers of indecency.<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>  
<P>
 This Court can address both of these perceived defects by recognizing
the test for indecency for interactive computer services and telecommunications
devices as a uniquely suited test for online indecency and recognizing
the broadly flexible compliance defenses for the various components
of the interactive computer media.  
<P>
<I>Amici</I> recognize that a standard of online indecency for
interactive computer services that are available to minors would
be more permissive than broadcast indecency and would allow unrestricted
availability of anything that can be aired on radio or TV, or
lawfully sold or displayed to a minor in a store, on a billboard,
on one's jacket in public, or provided to a minor by phone, fax,
mail, cable, or in a school, museum, or library<FONT SIZE=2>.
 </FONT>Congress's Conference Report on the CDA demonstrates just
such an expectation<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>and this Court's precedent
protects such a level of expression, even to minors, without violating
the indecency standard.<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT> This is not so for
broadcast indecency, which is the broadest test for indecency
and covers a wider breadth of sex and nudity because it is designed
to protect both minors and unconsenting adults over radio and
TV.  <I>See FCC v. Pacifica Foundation</I>, 438 U.S. 726, 748-50
(1978)<FONT SIZE=2>.  </FONT>The CDA chose the less restrictive
measure of only prohibiting the knowing transmission or display
of indecent material to minors, not unconsenting adults, so the
offense is narrower than under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1464 and differs
markedly from broadcasting law. Unlike for broadcasting, adults
are not protected by the CDA even if they inadvertently access
online indecency.  This Act requires only the protection of minor
children.
<P>
Online indecency was not intended and should not be held to have
the same scope as broadcast indecency and the two standards are
not co-extensive.  Adults under the CDA need not avoid all the
sex and nudity that would be prohibited or restricted to safe
harbor hours on radio or TV under the broadcast standard of indecency
and its enforcement policies.  Adults need only avoid sending
to children, or displaying to minors on sites that are available
to children, that type of explicit sexual depiction or description
that constitutes &quot;online indecency&quot; because its offensiveness
is patently clear under the circumstances when considering the
host of variables of value, intent, prurience, purpose, audience,
subject matter, etc.  As such, the type of pornographic indecency
that is unlawful to display to minors online encompasses all that
would be unlawful to display or sell to minors in all public streets,
places, and stores.  However, what could lawfully be available
to all adults and even children online can include any seriously
valuable sexual material that would not be indecent online, even
if it could be unlawful to broadcast (if indecent for unconsenting
adults and children) or prohibited from display in a commercial
store or public place (if harmful to minors).  Therefore, the
federal standard of &quot;online indecency&quot; is not <U>more</U>
restrictive than the state standard of &quot;harmful to minors&quot;
and can be less so when considered &quot;in context.&quot;  
<P>
It should be noted that the online indecency standard provides
even <U>more</U> latitude to consider serious literary, artistic,
political, and scientific value for adults, since it is based
on the second prong of the &quot;<I>Miller&quot; obscenity test,
than would the state &quot;harmful to minors&quot; standard, which
is based on a variable standard that considers what is offensive
in light of what is suitable for minors and what prurience and
value it would have </I><U>only</U> in relation to <U>minors</U>.
 <I>See Miller v. California</I>, 413 U.S. 15, 24-25 (1973); <I>
Ginsberg v. New York</I>, 390 U.S. 629, 634 (1968)<FONT SIZE=2>.
</FONT> 
<P>
The court below mistakenly arrived at just the opposite conclusion
and found that Congress adopted a more broadly encompassing test
with indecency than it would have with harmful to minors<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
 This misinterpretation alone warrants reversal of the District
Court's opinion that Congress should have no power to protect
children by use of the indecency standard for any regulation of
telecommunications devices and interactive computer services.
 
<P>
The court below failed to read the law as this Court required
in <I>Pacifica and created a hypothetical overbreadth that was
unwarranted by the plain words of the statute and made the CDA
falsely appear unconstitutional.  Faithfulness to Pacifica</I>
would have avoided such a result.
<P>
A faithful application of <I>Pacifica and Denver Area,</I> recognizing
the true capabilities and knowledge of the parties and accepting
the true nature of the test, is illustrated in the recent decision
of another three-judge court hearing a challenge to certain cable
TV provisions in the CDA and finding the harm to children a serious
matter warranting Government attention toward the most egregious
offenders who are well aware of the type of sexual exploitation
materials within the meaning of indecent.  <I>Playboy Entertainment
Group, Inc. v. United States</I>, 945 F. Supp. 772 (D. Del. 1996).
<P>
 A reasonable understanding of the test for &quot;online indecency&quot;
for the Internet and other computer and telecommunications systems,
would be to recognize that the CDA's use of the indecency standard
is in a specific contextual fashion that is uniquely applicable
to these interactive computer services and networks, as Congress
intended. <FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>In this regard, this Court need
not &quot;construe&quot; the statute so as to change it, but only
to read it within its constitutional scope, as the Court did in
<I>Pacifica, and make clear its lawful and intended reach</I><FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
 These <I>amici</I> submit that the court below &quot;construed&quot;
the law and did change its plain meaning, but did so in a way
that improperly expanded its sweep and, by doing so, the District
Court created a perceived overbreadth that is beyond the scope
of the test mandated in <I>Pacifica and intended by Congress to
be the standard for the CDA.  This Court, therefore, is faced
with resolving this conflict and should uphold the law within
its proper limits and for its intended and necessary purposes.</I>
<P>
As mandated in <I>Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750, the use of the indecency
standard in any medium is &quot;rested entirely on a nuisance
rationale under which </I><U>context is all-important</U>.&quot;
 This concept of &quot;context&quot; was explicitly incorporated
into the CDA by Congress, in recognition of the following holding
of the Court in <I>Pacifica, id.</I> (emphasis added):  
<P>
<U>The concept requires consideration of a host of variables.</U>
 The time of day was emphasized by the Commission.  The content
of the program in which the language is used will also affect
the composition of the audience, and the differences between radio,
television, and perhaps closed-circuit transmissions, may also
be relevant.  
<P>
 The indecency standard, as thus interpreted by this Court and
applied by the FCC, &quot;does not by any means reduce adults
to hearing only what is fit for children,&quot; <I>id.</I> at
750 n. 28, since consenting adults can obtain indecent materials
at stores and theaters and at times or under circumstances where
the dissemination of the offensive material may not be &quot;indecent&quot;
or may be channeled to adults or by a safe harbor policy.
<P>
 <I>Amici</I> submit that Congress made its intent and understanding
clear in the &quot;Conference Report on the CDA&quot; by stating
that this law was adopting a standard of indecency for online
services that was particularly sensitive to the presence of serious
value:
<P>
  The conferees intend that the term indecency (and the rendition
of the definition of that term in new section 502 [&#167; 223
(d)(1)(B)]) has the same meaning as established in <I>FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation</I>, &#133; and <I>Sable Communications of California,
Inc. v. FCC</I>, &#133; that the indecency standard is ... <U>specifically
limited in its reach</U> so that the term is not unconstitutionally
vague. ... [citing Circuit indecency cases]
<P>
  The precise <U>contours of the definition of indecency have
varied slightly depending on the communications medium </U>to
which it has been applied.  The essence of the phrase - patently
offensive descriptions of sexual and excretory activities - has
remained constant, however. ...
<P>
  The conferees considered, but rejected, the so-called &quot;harmful
to minors&quot; standard.  <I>See</I> <I>Ginsberg v. New York</I>,
&#133;.  The proponents of the &quot;harmful to minors&quot; standard
contended that that standard contains an exemption for material
with &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific
value,&quot; and therefore was the better of the two alternative
standards. ... <U>This assertion misapprehends the indecency standard
itself</U>, and disregards the Supreme Court's various rulings
on this issue.  <I>See</I> <I>Pacifica, &#133;at 743, n. 18, and
its progeny.</I>
<P>
  <U>The gravamen of the indecency concept is &quot;patent offensiveness.&quot;
 Such a determination cannot be made without a consideration of
the context of the description or depiction at issue.</U>  It
is the understanding of the conferees that, as applied, the patent
offensiveness inquiry involves two distinct elements: the intention
to be patently offensive, and a patently offensive result. . .
.[citing FCC rulings]  <U>Material with serious redeeming value
is quite obviously intended to edify and educate, not to offend.
 Therefore, it will be imperative to consider the context and
the nature of the material in question when determining its &quot;patent
offensiveness.&quot;</U>
<P>
  [<U>U]se of the indecency standard poses no significant risk
to</U> the free-wheeling and vibrant nature of discourse or to
<U>serious, literary, and artistic works</U> that currently can
be found on the Internet, and which is expected to continue and
grow.  As the Supreme Court itself noted when upholding the constitutionality
of indecency prohibitions, prohibiting indecency merely focuses
speakers to re-cast their message into less offensive terms, but
does not prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of the communication.
. . . Likewise, requiring that access restrictions be imposed
to protect minors from exposure to indecent material does not
prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of the indecent communication,
it merely puts it in its appropriate place: away from children.
<P>
[Conf. Rep. at 188-89, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. Leg. Hist. at 202-03]
[Emphasis added, citations omitted.]
<P>
 The enactment of the CDA with the federal indecency standard
was not, therefore, a rejection of the serious value prong of
the &quot;harmful to minors&quot; test.  Congress adopted an even
less restrictive test with indecency, since only a lack of serious
value for minors is relevant to the state standard whereas indecency
considers serious value for adults as well as minors.  The presence
of truly serious value or purpose is a significant factor in a
finding that a presentation does not offend or was not intended
to offend.  Conversely, that which is &quot;pandered&quot; for
its prurience could be found not to be offered for a serious purpose
or for any serious value<FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT>
<P>
 Under the &quot;online indecency&quot; test, the Government need
not affirmatively prove the presence of prurience or lack of serious
value.  However, the trier of fact <U>must</U> nevertheless consider
the presence of value and, in addition, may consider any evidence
of pandering to prurient interests in determining the patent offensiveness
of the material in the specific factual context of the &quot;host
of variables&quot; that are inherent in the legal &quot;term of
art&quot; the law calls &quot;indecency.&quot;
<P>
 Therefore, this Court can recognize that online indecency is
a medium specific standard for the CDA and is a proper synthesis
of the &quot;host of variables&quot; in a nuisance rationale,
as required by <I>Pacifica and Denver Area,</I> such as the following:
<BR>

<P>
&quot;<U>Online indecency</U>&quot; means any communication that,
&quot;in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive
as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs&quot;.  Any determination of patent offensiveness
must consider the presence, lack, or inherent involvement of the
following host of variables:  any serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value inherent in the material itself;
any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific purpose
to which the material was intended or used by the communicator;
the time, place, and manner of the communication; the content,
theme, and context of the material in relation to its subject
matter, program, forum, and manner of presentation; the composition
and age of the audience;  the pervasiveness of the medium used
and its availability to minor children under the circumstances;
 any evidence of intention to be patently offensive; and any evidence
of pandering or exploiting a prurient interest in nudity, sex,
or excretion in the creation, marketing, or dissemination of the
material.<BR>

<P>
As used, the CDA's indecency test for online computer services
need not make each variable a separate element, but clarifies
that it is the totality of the circumstances that shall be considered
in making the ultimate determination of whether the communication
was &quot;patently offensive&quot; in the context in which it
was made, disseminated, and received.<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT> One
need not pre-judge its application in every future or hypothetical
circumstance to know that the fairness of the result will be governed
by the mandate that each future judgment be guided by constitutional
principles, such as &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; and &quot;presumption
of innocence&quot;, or an objective rule such as the &quot;reasonable
man&quot; of fact finding.<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>
<P>
 Such a judicial melding of the generic definition with its constitutional
considerations is faithfully consistent with this Court's development
of the tests for obscenity, child pornography, harmful to minors,
and indecency, and with the intent of Congress as expressed in
the CDA and its accompanying Conference Report.  This would accomplish
the same sensitivity to First Amendment values and allow this
test to be used, like that for obscenity and harmful to minors,
as a constitutionally valid method of separating protected speech,
that may be freely and openly distributed to everyone online,
from patently offensive sexual and excretory depictions that are
indecent in the online context and clearly inappropriate for knowing
transmissions or displays to minor children.
<P>
This is the mandate of <I>Pacifica.</I>  As the Conference Report
explains, it is also the affirmatively expressed intent of Congress
in adopting the indecency test of <I>Pacifica for the computer
medium.  In determining whether material is patently offensive
in the context of interactive computer services, and therefore
meets the test for online indecency, courts and triers of fact
</I><U>must</U> consider its offensiveness in the context of the
host of variables mandated by this Court in <I>Pacifica and Denver
Area, including the presence of serious value or purpose and,
if evident, any pandering to prurient interests.  As such, the
CDA would </I><U>not</U> reach legitimate and serious sexual information
that should be protected, as the Government properly represented
below.<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
 The CDA is <I>not</I> a total ban on indecency, and should not
be interpreted to have the same effect as a ban<FONT SIZE=2>.
</FONT> In contrast, the CDA criminalizes the knowing transmission
of indecent material to a specific minor child and the knowing
display of indecent material to minors.  The offenses in this
Act require an offender to act &quot;knowingly&quot; by knowing
of the sexually explicit character of the communication and knowing
that it is going to or is available to minors.  This dual <I>scienter</I>
element further narrows the reach and scope of the law, since

<P>
<B>INDECENCY TO MINORS ARE COMPELLED BY </B>
<P>
<B>THE NEED TO PROTECT CHILDREN.<BR>
</B>
<P>
 The CDA is carefully tailored to do no more than is necessary
to further the compelling interest in protecting children from
accessing online indecency. 
<P>
Sexually explicit images are undeniably present and available
online, and &quot;pornographic repositories tend to be heavily
accessed&quot; making it &quot;more freely available over the
Internet than in other mass communications media in the United
States.&quot; &quot;Until the CDA, the only barrier to viewing
free pornographic images on the Web was often a mouse click affirming
that the viewer is of requisite age.&quot;  <I>Id.</I>
<P>
This Court's precedent is unmistakably clear that the Government
does have a compelling interest in protecting children from pornography.
 This Court articulated such an interest in <I>Ginsberg v. New
York</I>, 390 U.S. at 636-43; <I>Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-50;
Sable, 492 U.S. at 128; Denver Area, 116 S. Ct. at 2391,</I><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>and has consistently reaffirmed it, most recently in <I>Denver
Area, 116 S. Ct. 2374, 2391 (1996).</I>
<P>
<B> </B>The court below concluded that it is &quot;highly unlikely&quot;
that a young child will &quot;come across&quot; pornographic material
while surfing the Web, and regarded as significant the notion
that &quot;the receipt of information requires a series of affirmative
steps.&quot;  929 F. Supp. at 852.  The extent to which children
will affirmatively search for or inadvertently observe sexually
explicit pictures on their computer screens is completely irrelevant
to the issues in this case, since the compelling interest in protecting
them from seeing such material remains the same in either event.
 <I>Id.</I> at 883.
<P>
The District Court also emphasized that &quot;a child requires
some sophistication and some ability to read to retrieve material.&quot;
 929 F. Supp. at 845 
<P>
These conclusions reveal the lower court's lack of recognition
of the ease with which children can maneuver today's computers,<FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>especially in the point-and-click icon format of the World
Wide Web which demands neither computer nor English literacy.
<P>
 [I]t is relatively simple for persons of any age and modest experience
with the Internet to set up their computers so that reaching repositories
of pornography is as simple as selecting a TV channel.
<P>
The interactive nature of this new medium, if anything, deepens
the Government's interest in protecting children from access to
or receipt of online pornography.  That is why Congress passed
the CDA. 
<P>
A review of the Telecommunications Act as a whole reveals Congress's
intent to expand the development of the Internet, through various
means including financial incentives and discounts for schools
to provide Internet access to all of American's children.   The
goal of stimulating the growth and use of the Internet for all,
including children, requires a concomitant responsibility to take
steps to make the Internet safely available to them.  If pornography
is allowed to proliferate and is freely available to minor children,
then there will be a disincentive to universal access and use
of the Internet at home and in schools and libraries.  Therefore,
Congress considered protecting children a necessary part of its
interest in facilitating the growth of this important educational
and social medium.<BR>

<P>
<B>III. CONGRESS CHOSE THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS OF PROTECTING
CHILDREN FROM ONLINE PORNOGRAPHY.<BR>
</B>
<P>
 Congress enacted the CDA because it was the least restrictive,
yet effective, means of promoting its interest in protecting children
from access to and receipt of patently offensive sexual and excretory
depictions online.  
<P>
The court below recited in its Findings of certain assertions
about the nature of the Internet and conclusions that the CDA
would criminalize all sexual speech, that compliance is &quot;technologically
impossible&quot; and &quot;economically prohibitive&quot; and
therefore not a least restrictive means, 929 F. Supp. at 854,
and that the CDA will not prevent children from getting pornography
and therefore it fails for underbreadth.  The court held that
its Findings &quot;lead to the conclusion that <U>Congress may
not regulate indecency on the Internet at all</U>.&quot;  929
F. Supp. at 877 (emphasis added). 
<P>
This Court's precedent is to the contrary:  &quot;[O]ur cases
have not left Congress or the States powerless to address the
most serious problems.&quot; <I>Denver Area, 116 S. Ct. at 2384.
 The First Amendment is committed to protecting most speech from
regulation, </I>
<P>
 but without imposing judicial formulae so rigid that they become
a straightjacket that disables Government from responding to serious
problems.  This Court, in different contexts, has consistently
held that the Government may directly regulate speech to address
extraordinary problems, where its regulations are appropriately
tailored to resolve those problems without imposing an unnecessarily
great restriction on speech.
<P>
<I>Denver Area, 116 S. Ct. at 2385.</I>
<P>
The decision below renders the Government helpless to do anything
but hope that parents will purchase and install blocking software
in the family computer, and concludes that this is all that is
<I>necessary</I> to protect children from online indecency.  To
the contrary, Congress has a compelling interest to affirmatively
protect children so that they may participate in this new and
extraordinary medium, especially where private actors fail to
use even the blocking and screening methods at their disposal
to protect children from the domestic and foreign pornography
that is available online.
<P>
 Inherent in a least restrictive means analysis is the expectation
that the &quot;means&quot; are actions constitutionally taken
by Congress, not by private actors.  They are legislative in nature,
and therefore mandatorynever voluntary.  Hypothetical, ad-hoc
ways for private individuals to address the problems in which
Government has a compelling interest are inapposite to the means
by which Government may attempt to promote its compelling interest.<FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT> &quot;[P]arents and others . . . who have th[e] primary
responsibility for children's well-being are entitled to the support
of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility.&quot;
 <I>Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh</I>, 938 F.2d 1535,
1541 (2nd Cir. 1991), <I>cert. denied</I> 502 U.S. 1072 (1992).
 <I>See also Information Providers' Coalition v. FCC</I>, 928
F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991).  
<P>
It stretches the limits of logic and legal precedent to suggest
that the Government may take steps to fulfill its compelling interest
in protecting children from pornography in every medium, including
print, video, television, radio, and the private telephone, but
the Government may do <I>nothing</I> to further its compelling
interest where pornography reaches children by online computers,
faxes, videophones, and other interactive computer services and
telecommunication devices.  Further, it has the untenable and
intolerable result that even direct, knowing transmissions of
pornography to a known child must be tolerated because &quot;the
Government may not, through the CDA, interrupt that [world-wide
Internet] conversation.&quot; 929 F. Supp. at 883.  Absent from
the opinion below is any discussion acknowledging that it is fundamentally
wrong for adults to knowingly give pornography to children.
<P>
As a matter of law, Congress has an independent interest in protecting
children from exposure to or receipt of patently offensive sexual
or excretory depictions, and is not required and should not be
compelled to rely on the private, voluntary actions of others,
such as parents, but can encourage their assistance.  
<P>
Plaintiffs below proffered parental screening software products
as a less restrictive alternative to the CDA.  Even if they were
relevant, however, such actions are not effective, and therefore
do not constitute a less restrictive but &quot;as effective&quot;
alternative to the CDA.
<P>
Although all parents, schools, and libraries may and should make
use of whatever software products are available (<I>i.e.</I> X-Stop,
Rated-PG, Library Safe, CyberPatrol) to gain whatever benefits
that they can offer, not all parents will purchase such software,
and, even if they do, children have access to many computers which
will not employ software filtering devices such as in schools,
libraries, and neighbors homes.
<P>
That the CDA rests the burden of compliance upon the speaker of
patently offensive sexual or excretory depictions and not on the
consumer of these depictions, including children, not only carries
the weight of unanimous precedent, but also has the benefit of
being highly  practical.  Law and logic compel the conclusion
that, as between speaker and consumer, the speaker is in the better
position to know the content of his speech.  Plaintiffs would
transfer the obligation from those who are in the best position
to know whether something is a patently offensive sexual or excretory
depiction to the consumers, who must search, find, identify, and
then attempt to block the hundreds of thousands of available pornographic
images from their children.
<P>
 Steps like parental involvement in their children's use of the
Internet, the installation of filtering software, and content-rating
protocols are each important elements in protecting children on
the Internet. These self-help measures should be regarded as complements
to the CDA, much as the parental admonition, &quot;don't talk
to strangers&quot; complements laws against kidnapping.  None
of them, however, individually or in the aggregate, eliminates
the need for legal prohibition of sending or displaying pornography
to children, or supplants Congress's constitutional authority
to take action in furtherance of its compelling interest.<BR>

<P>
<B>IV. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CDA IS FEASIBLE AND NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE.<BR>
</B>
<P>
The flexibility and capability of Internet technology makes few,
if any, desired goals impossible to attain.  The CDA restrictions
and defenses were designed with this flexibility and potential
for creativity in mind.
<P>
Under the challenged sections of the CDA, it is not a crime for
adults to provide online indecency to other adults, consenting
or not.  Furthermore, even if a child does obtain patently offensive
sexual or excretory depictions, it is a defense to criminal or
civil liability, under &#167; 223 (e)(5) and (f)(1), that the
provider of the depictions took good faith actions under available
technology to limit such depictions to adults.  Such good faith
actions are an essential aspect of this law, both legally and
technologically.  The CDA is a technology flexible statute that
allows pornography providers to take actions with the means now
available, but expects that more will be done when more can fairly
be done.<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
 The defenses provided in the CDA are both all inclusive of true
good faith efforts and allow for more defenses than are available
under any other federal indecency law, including broadcasting,
cablecasting, or dial-a-porn.  The CDA not only incorporates the
defenses applicable to the dial-a-porn offenses in &#167; 223
(b) and (c), which were promulgated by the FCC and specifically
referred to with approval by this Court in <I>Sable, </I> but
also provides good faith defenses to those who take steps of their
own device or pursuant to any future FCC regulation in order to
protect children from accessing their patently offensive sexual
or excretory depictions. The CDA's criminal and civil immunities
for good faith and &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; acts are available
to those who take affirmative steps to restrict indecency from
minors, not for taking no action.
<P>
The court below granted the injunction against the CDA in part
because  it concluded that compliance is &quot;either technologically
impossible or economically prohibitive for most plaintiffs.&quot;
 The lower court overestimated the difficulties of compliance
with the CDA and underestimated the capabilities of interactive
computer technology. One of the ways in which the court below
distorted the problem of compliance was in its misconstruction
of the indecency standard to include communications related in
any way to sexuality, which, as stated above, is a patent misapprehension
of the constitutional parameters of indecency and the stated intent
of Congress.  And to proceed, as the lower court did, from the
observation that the &quot;the strength of the Internet is [its]
chaos&quot; is to misunderstand the true systematic orderliness
of the Internet.
<P>
It is certainly difficult to relate the observation that compliance
is &quot;either technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot;
to the prohibitions of subsection 223(a)(1)(B) and (d)(1)(A) against
knowingly sending indecent material directly to a known child.
 <I>Amici</I> submit that, in light of the scienter element, there
is no legal or logical reason for finding these direct transmission
crimes facially unconstitutional.  This Court's precedent, from
<I>Ginsberg to Pacifica to Sable,</I> is unequivocally clear about
the constitutionality of such a prohibition. 
<P>
In addition, Judge Sloviter concluded below that it would be a
&quot;burden . . . impossible to sustain&quot; (929 F. Supp. at
856) for people online to review their content for patently offensive
sexual or excretory depictions.  Such a conclusion, if accepted
here, would seem to render infeasible <I>any </I>Internet regulation,
and certainly other pornography-related prohibitions to which
Plaintiffs have made no challenge.  Internet content and access
providers are no more or less able to evaluate their material
pursuant to obscenity and child pornography laws which apply online
than they would be pursuant to the CDA. 
<P>
Since content and service providers must provide solutions to
the problem of obscenity and child pornography and since those
solutions are likely to be equally effective in regulating indecent
or patently offensive expression as well, the technological impossibility
argument is not necessarily a persuasive argument, either factually
or legally.
<P>
That reasonable methods of compliance are technologically feasible
is further demonstrated by the fact that many sites are now screening
children from access to pornographic materials.  There will undoubtedly
be more ways to comply in the future, especially when the market
is encouraged by the presence of a legal obligation. While evolving
technologies are increasing and improving the means of restricting
pornography from children, and the FCC can lend its expertise
in defining further good faith defense measures pursuant to subsection
223 (e)(6), it should not be a matter for dispute that there are
sufficient and adequate means already available under present
technology for adults to keep their patently offensive sexual
or excretory depictions from minors.
<P>
The act does not require the impossible, but only requires reasonable,
effective, and appropriate actions to prevent children's access
to or receipt of pornography. The lower court ignored that there
are a variety of  &quot;no tech&quot; and &quot;low tech&quot;
means to comply with the CDA as simple as knowing who you are
communicating with, channeling indecent communications to &quot;adults
only&quot; areas, utilizing contractual obligations with subscribers,
access providers, and content providers for monitoring.
<P>
 Other potential means of compliance include system-wide protocols
for screening children's access, server-level filtering software,
mechanisms which allow content providers to identify adult visitors
to their sites, pages, or GIFs, and digital IDs for adults or
minors that could provide an age to visited sites, age-tagging
programs or protocols, such as the successful &quot;-L18&quot;
program illustrated in the hearing below, or an adaptation of
the next generation's Internet Protocol for address and routing
packets (&quot;IPv6&quot;) to code for age in its expanded header
extensions for authentication and privacy capabilities, a modification
of the existing &quot;finger&quot; program for requesting visitor
identification which could be relayed back to the visitor's ISP
for a reply that the subscriber is of a certain age without giving
a name (thus preserving anonymity and privacy protections for
children).
<P>
 Although not added to the Findings, it was admitted in the opinion
below that sites on the World Wide Web have the present capacity
to use &quot;cgi scripts&quot; to exclude minors from accessing
pornography.  929 F. Supp. at 854.  This situation is likewise
with the Usenet, where much of the most graphic and notorious
pornography is made available, both hard- and soft-core, normal
and perverted, actual and simulated.  The Findings below describe
the Usenet as an open and uncontrolled medium, yet each Internet
service or access provider must choose which Usenet feeds to accept.
 The Plaintiffs did not disclose, and the court failed to find,
that the Usenet is actually a privately owned, proprietary, commercial
subscription service with closed access and control over each
newsgroup, moderated or not, by an administrator.  If an ISP does
not subscribe to a particular hierarchy or newsgroup feed, it
cannot be accessed by customers through that ISP, who would read
the groups from the ISP's local server rather than from some remote
server or Usenet backbone server somewhere else.  The Usenet is
totally within the control of the ISP, who could be subject to
prosecution for obscenity, child pornography, stalking, and even
providing known access to minors, since this is not a &quot;common
carrier&quot; service and not within the exemption of &#167; 223
(e)(1).
<P>
Moreover commercial online services must decide which commercial
services to subscribe to, such as encyclopedias, news, financial
data services, Usenet hierarchies, or other special interests.
 Many commercial Bulletin Board Services do the same and either
use the Internet to advertise their BBS telephone number or contract
to have their board's content offered by a commercial online content
or access provider.  Such contractual arrangements are obviously
and legally subject to control and existing technology could be
used to screen for minors on any such subscription services that
would contain pornography.
<P>
 The commercial, educational, institutional, and corporate online
service providers, in addition to acting as ISPs and providing
access to the Internet and World Wide Web, can and often do, offer
other material over which they have absolute editorial control
(such as services, boards, chat rooms, and pages).  A service
provider must also exercise conscious and deliberate subscription
control over which commercial or privately owned services it will
take onto its own servers in order to re-offer it to its customers
or users.  
<P>
This Court in <I>Sable, supra</I>, 492 U.S. at 126-27: recognized
the constitutionality of compliance by making private arrangements
with third parties.
<P>
In <U>all</U> of these instances, every Internet service and access
provider can use available server-level screening software to
protect the children on their computer systems from pornography.
 Though the first generation end-user programs were unreliable,
as the &quot;online demonstration&quot; in the hearing which failed
below illustrates, the next generation server-based applications
offer better protection, and ISPs should employ software for minors
on their systems, and leave it to parents to unblock if any parent
so chooses.
<P>
Some members of the industry may consider solving the problem
to be against their economic interests.  Whether the defenses
are economically unpleasant is not dispositive for First Amendment
analysis.  The Court in <I>Sable, supra</I>, 492 U.S. at 126-27,<I>
</I>made it clear that compliance costs for the providers of patently
offensive sexual or excretory depictions do not affect the constitutionality
of the statute:
<P>
 While Sable may be forced to incur some costs in developing and
implementing a system for screening the locale of incoming calls,
there is no constitutional impediment to enacting a law which
may impose such costs on a medium electing to provide these messages.
<P>
While those who provide patently offensive sexual or excretory
depictions may well incur some costs in order to attempt to screen
their depictions from children, the cost to children of their
failure to do so is incalculable.
<P>
 In light of the possibilities for complying with the CDA's limited
requirements, the assertion of impossibility may portend simply
seen an unwillingness to undertake the effort.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>CONCLUSION<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B> </B>Each time the pornographers break through a new barrier,
society's best reaction should be the honorable one - to protect
the children first.
<P>
As one of the CDA's original sponsors said on the day this law
was enacted by the Congress:
<P>
 <I>Sometimes our technology races beyond our reflection, and
we are left with a dangerous gapa period when society is unprepared
to deal with the far-reaching results of rapid change.  That is
the situation we have on the Internet.  This is the situation
which [the CDA] will address.</I>
