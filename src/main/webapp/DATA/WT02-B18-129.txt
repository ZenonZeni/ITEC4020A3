<h1><strong>About APWU</strong> </h1>
<p>The American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, represents 366,000
employees of the U.S. Postal Service who are clerks, maintenance
employees, motor vehicle operators, special delivery messengers,
and non-mail processing professional employees. The world's
largest postal union, APWU is also the fifteenth largest union in
the AFL-CIO. </p>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>Postal unions, dating back to the nineteenth century, have
gone through a number of transitions paralleling the growth of
the former Post Office Department and its transformation into the
U.S. Postal Service under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970.
Under the PRA, postal unions first won the right to bargain
collectively over wages, hours and working conditions. </p>
<p>APWU was founded on July 1, 1971, the result of a merger of
five postal unions: the United Federation of Postal Clerks, the
National Postal Union, the National Association of Post Office
and General Service Maintenance Employees, the National
Federation of Motor Vehicle Employees and the National
Association of Special Delivery Messengers.</p>

<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>APWU's top officers are the president, Moe Biller; the
executive vice president, William Burrus; and the
secretary-treasurer, Douglas Holbrook.</p>
<p>The union's organizational structure reflects its separate
craft origins. There are five craft divisions: clerk,
maintenance, motor vehicle, special delivery and mail handler,
and a support services department. Other headquarters departments
are industrial relations, legislative, research and education,
organization, and human relations. Craft divisons and departments
are each headed by a director.</p>
<p>The three top officers, the directors of the departments and
divisions, other craft division and department officers, five
regional coordinators and 60 national business agents are all
elected by mail ballot referendum of the membership every three
years. The next election of officers will be in 1998.</p>
<p>The APWU has more than 2000 locals located in every state and
territory of the United States. Its top governing body is the
biennial national convention, the next to be held in August,
1998. Between conventions, a 13-person national executive board
sets union policy. Members of the NEB are the top three officers,
the five craft division directors, the director of industrial
relations and the five regional coordinators.</p>
