<IMG SRC="gifs/dolpushes_head.gif" ALT="The DOL Pushes For Better Investment Education">
<BR> 

Workers are increasingly finding themselves responsible for the
investment management of their retirement savings.  The reason?
 The growing popularity of participant-directed individual account
retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans. An advantage of these
plans is that they remove the burden of investment allocation
from employers.  In return, workers hold ultimate control over
their accounts and are oftentimes given more flexibility in their
investment options.
<P>
Although such plans are generally viewed as positive, the 
<A HREF="http://www.dol.gov">U.S. Department of Labor 
(DOL)</A> has become concerned.  The DOL fears
that participants may not understand investment principles well
enough to make informed decisions that will ensure an adequate
retirement income.  In addition, the responsibility of choosing
investments may frighten workers who do not understand investment
principles, thus deterring them from plan participation.
<P>
To combat these drawbacks, many employers and plan sponsors have
provided workers with basic investment education programs.  Many
others, however, have held back.  They fear that their investment
education may be construed as offering &quot;investment advice&quot;
under section 3 (21) (A) (ii) of ERISA, which could give rise
to fiduciary status and potential liabilities.  
<P>
In an effort to promote better investment education by employers,
the DOL recently published <A HREF="http://www.benefitslink.com/erisaregs/96-1.html">
<I>Interpretive Bulletin 96-1</I></A>.
 The bulletin clarifies the differences between investment education
and investment advice. It also identifies four categories of investment
education, which are summarized below.
<P>
<I><B>1) Plan Information</B></I>
<BR>
Any materials that explain the operation of the plan, its investment
alternatives, the benefits of enrolling, the advantages of increasing
contributions and how preretirement withdrawals may lessen retirement
income.
<P>
<I><B>2) General Financial and Investment Information</B></I>
<BR>
Information that explains such topics as risk and return, diversification,
dollar cost averaging, compounded return, tax deferred investment,
effects of inflation, determining time horizons, and other similar
financial and investment concepts.
<P>
<I><B>3) Asset Allocation Models</B></I> 
<BR>
Materials that illustrate different portfolio asset allocations
based on various time horizons and risk profiles and are based
on generally accepted investment theories and principles.
<P>
<I><B>4)  Interactive Investment Materials</B></I> 
<BR>
Worksheets, software and similar materials, which provide a participant
the means to estimate future retirement income needs and assess
the impact of different asset allocations on retirement income.
<P>
Ongoing investment education can play a crucial role in helping
your workers understand what it takes to invest successfully.
 A better understanding by employees may also expand your plan's
participation and contribution rates.  As always, contact your
financial or legal advisor if you have questions about your company's
investment education programs.  If you know his or her e-mail
address, <A HREF="mailto:">send an e-mail now</A>.
