<P><I><FONT SIZE=+2>Mad Dog Expeditions was formed to expand the experience of sport diving into
realms usually reserved for scientists and heavily sponsored exploration teams.</FONT></I>  The
sites will all present unique challenges.  Some will add a dimension of exploration  to an
accessible diving experience; some will reveal worlds seen by few humans; some will demand a high
level of advance work in conditioning and specialized dive training.  All will contain a strong
educational component to enrich and inform your participation.

Besides our exisiting <A HREF="SCHEDULE/schedule.html"><B>S<FONT SIZE=-1>CHEDULE OF</FONT> E<FONT SIZE=-1>XPEDITIONS</FONT></B></A> in the <A HREF="PLACES/amazon.html">Amazon</A>, <A HREF="PLACES/ARCTIC.HTMl">The Arctic</A>, <A HREF="PLACES/cave.html">Florida/Mexico caves</A> and many wrecks of the world we will be
adding further new programs in late 1996 and 1997. After having a successful trip to study the <A HREF="sharks/sharksf.html">Great
White Sharks</A> in South Africa this April we will return again in March of 1997. In November of 96 and
throughout 1997 we will dive the Aircraft carrier USS Saratoga in <A HREF="places/bikini.html">Bikini</A> along with the other
magnificent wrecks of this region. For those  wishing to dive a little closer to home, <A HREF="PLACES/wkscay.html">shark diving
in the Bahamas</A> and many wreck sites along the USA coast are scheduled. 
<P><IMG SRC="train.gif" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="50" ALT="TRAINING ">We will continue and expand our
Technical Diver Education and <A HREF="schedule/wreck.html">Wrecks of the World</A> programs.  These two programs work hand in hand to
provide divers with the opportunity to undertake technical training while they explore some of the
world's most exciting and challenging wrecks.  We will be offering all levels of ice, cave, wreck, 
NITROX and mixed gas certification.  All technical training is through IANTD, cave training is with
NACD & NSS CDS and recreation training is with PADI.  The wrecks will vary from tropical dives
within recreational limits to 300+ foot virgin sites in sub-Arctic conditions.  Experience and
training will determine which ones are right for you.

We are very excited to announce that Mad Dog Expeditions and Cis-Lunar Development Laboratories have forged an exclusive alliance to promote exploration opportunities with the use of rebreathers.  Given our insatiable appetite for new frontiers, it seemed logical to team up with the manufacturer of the world's most technically advanced closed circuit life support system.
<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="CAVE.JPG" WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="158">The Cis-Lunar Mk 5 has been subjected to more rigorous, real life testing than any other unit  currently on or off the market.  Originally designed to include the possibility of space applications, it is the only unit that has proven it can go anywhere we can take it.  To us it represents an invaluable tool to reach previously inaccessible areas.  To our customers, this will mean new technical and non-technical diving destinations, a greatly enhanced technical training schedule and, in the foreseeable future, occasional Cis-Lunar experiences.  For rebreather users, particularly Cis-Lunar owners, it will also mean rebreather dedicated trips, field support on trips and always having a similarly trained and equipped dive buddy. 
<P>Though the units may not be rented, they are currently available for sale, to pre-qualified divers, directly through Cis-Lunar.  To find out more, give them a call at (508) 368-0771.
