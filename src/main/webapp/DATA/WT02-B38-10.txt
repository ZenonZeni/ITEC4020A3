COURTING FAVOR: S&LS GIVEN NARROW ODDS ON SUPERVISORY GOODWILL

Oral arguments held on supervisory goodwill Feb. 10
revealed a bitterly divided, 11-member court likely to decide for or
against the thrift industry by a margin as thin as a single vote.
     Industry lawyers were buoyed by the receptiveness of many
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit judges to its
arguments and by concession of key points by the government. But too many
judges still appear to be leaning toward the governments camp to predict an
industry win in the battle over whether Uncle Sam owes thriftsboth living
and deadfor supervisory goodwill promises made during the debacle.
     Between 40 and 50 supervisory goodwill cases have already
been filed and a victory in this lead case could encourage more to step
forward. The number of cases could rise above 100 and claims could add up
to $1 billion.
     Its too close to call, said Daniel J. Goldberg, an attorney
with Housley Goldberg & Kantarian in Washington. Goldberg predicted a 6-5
or 7-4 decision in a ruling that could take a year.
     Edward H. Sisson, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, a
Washington firm representing several supervisory goodwill cases, said he
was encouraged by how the court received the arguments, giving a slight
edge to thrifts.
     Sisson said that government arguments, such as that
supervisory goodwill agreements were not contracts and the so-called
sovereign acts doctrine, were revealed as red herrings.
     Under sovereign acts doctrine, the government can breach
contracts without obligation so long as it acts to benefit the general
welfare.
     Sisson and other observers were surprised that the
governments attorney, Douglas Letter, conceded under grilling from Judge
Pauline Newman that the goodwill agreements did constitute contracts.
Newman dissented in a pro-government decision by a three-member panel of
the same court in May 1993.
     If we agree with the court of federal claims that these are
contracts, Newman said, then the govern-ments position on sovereign rights
doesnt apply.
     Goldberg said he was also surprised that Letter appeared to
concede the regulatory capital credit issue to thrifts. This could be
significant, Goldberg said, since the counsel for Glendale, Jerry Stouck of
Spriggs & Hollingsworth, and for Statesman, Charles J. Cooper of Shaw,
Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, pursued somewhat different strategies.
     Statesmans claim is widely seen to be stronger than
Glendales and Goldberg said it was possible, though less likely, that
Statesman would prevail but not Glendale. But both have valid contracts, he
hastened to add.
     The oral arguments were punctuated by interruptions from
argumentative judges, who asked for clarifications or interjected sarcastic
barbs. Several judges seemed intolerant of the governments attempt to walk
away from a contract and from responsibility for any attendant damages.
     Letter repeatedly invoked an interpretation of the Supreme
Court ruling in Powen vs. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security
Entrapment, 477 U.S. 441, a 1986 case suggesting that the government has a
right to break a contract.
     At one point Judge S. Jay Plager cut in, telling him, I
want you to remember something from first year [law school] contracts
class.
     I had a terrible first year contracts professor, Letter
said. I learned almost nothing.
     Plager instructed Letter that nobody disputes that the
government can break a contract. But when a contract is broken damages must
be paid. Plager then said that thrifts never would have taken on millions
of dollars in liability by taking over insolvent institutions without
goodwill accounting promises from the government. Nor would regulators have
tried to resolve one failing thrift by dragging down another, said Plager,
referring to the knock-out impact of broken goodwill promises.
     I have arguments for all of that, Letter said.
     Obviously something you learned in contracts, Plager said.
     Or in my opinions, joked Chief Judge Helen Nies, who wrote
the majority opinion in the earlier pro-government decision.
     Minutes later, Letter tried to flatter Plager by saying, I
wish I had had you as my first year contracts professor.
     Me too, we wouldnt be here, the judge retorted.
     In the course of his argument, Nies pressed Stouck to show
her where in Glendales agreement did the government specifically agree to a
40-year goodwill amortization period and promise that there would be no
change in policy, the so-called double promise.
     Stouck said these details were spelled out in a letter to
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board by Glendales accountant in a letter he
said was integrated into the contract.

INTERSTATE BRANCHING BILL: IT HAS LEGS

With interstate branching legislation appearing to have its
best shot in almost a decade in passing Congress this year, industry
lawyers and lobbyists are scrambling to reshape a measure cynics had given
little chance of winning congressional approval this yearif ever.
     It has legs, one legislative lobbyist for a bank trade
group in Washington said. I never thought I would ever see it passed in my
lifetime, nevertheless my career, he said with  little sarcasm.
     The linchpin of the political viability of the legislation
is language that bars branching across state lines without acquisitiona big
carrot to community banks  because it offers  a potential windfall if they
want to sell out.
     An amendment to the legislation offering incentives to
institutions seeking to branch interstate to do so by acquiring troubled or
marginally capitalized institutions is among options being proposed by some
members of Congress, industry officials and regulators. No such requirement
is contained in the initial legislation that passed the financial
institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee Feb. 3 by a 29-0
vote. Ironically, the bill was passed before it was officially introduced.
But markup by the full banking committee could come before the end of
February.
     Another potential change would be to allow states to opt
out of Douglas amendment repeal, an amendment that will be sought by the
Independent Bankers Association of America. That group believes that the
legislation passed Feb. 3 gives the back of its hand to 14 states that have
not chosen to allow holding companies outside regional compacts to acquire
banks in their state.
     The bill passed by the House panel permits full nationwide
interstate bank holding company acquisitions one year after enactment and
national bank interstate branching by acquisition three years after
enactment. The bill allows states to opt out entirely from interstate
branching within three years after enactment of branching legislation. The
bill also allows bank holding companies operating in more than one state to
consolidate those subsidiaries into one bank 18 months after enactment.
     But  securities analysts and industry lobbyists believe
that the IBAAs concerns about allowing states to opt out of repeal of the
Douglas amendment is a mere face-saving move aimed at disguising the fact
the IBAA was caught off guard by Sen. Christopher J. Dodds, D-Conn.,
announcement and the new-found momentum behind the bill that Dodds decision
created.
     These officials also said that the only bank of note to
benefit from a state opting out of repeal of the Douglas amendment would be
Barnett Bank of Jacksonville,  a $38 billion-asset institution that
dominates the Florida market but is weak outside the state. One analyst in
New York speculated that two potential acquirers Barnett would like to hold
off are BankAmerica in California and Chemical Bank of New York.
     Steve Verdier, senior legislative counsel for the IBAA,
confirmed that the IBAA was surprised at Dodds announcement and the new-
found potential for the bill to pass. I think you could write that about
anyone in Washington connected with banking legislation, he said. No one
outside of Mark Leggett, the Washington lobbyist for NationsBank, gave
interstate branching more than an outside chance of passage this year.
     No small part of its new-found momentum is the statement
Feb. 3 by  Dodd announcing that he would not seek to bog the legislation
down by adding an amendment that hamstrings the ability of banks of all
sizes to grow their insurance sales business.

MULDOON DOES $1 BILLION IN CONVERSIONS IN 1993

Insiders arent the only ones benefiting from sweet mutual
conversion deals. Muldoon, Murphy & Faucette of Washington did the legal
billing on 15 mutual to stock flips in 1993 worth a total of $1.03 billion.
     While Silver, Freedman & Taff handled six more flip deals
than Muldoon, its rival handled bigger flips that issued far more stock.
Offerings associated with Muldoon averaged $68.5 million per flip. Silver
flips averaged $42.2 million.
     We came out on top because we have a lot of very
experienced people who work in securities and almost everybody has
government experience, said Joseph A. Muldoon Jr. He said the firm thrives
because it takes good care of its clients.
     The top underwriting, legal and appraisal firms dominated
the biggest of the 109 thrifts that converted from mutual to stock form
last year, raising $2.1 billion in gross proceeds, according to the data of
SNL Securities.
     The king of the conversion hill is Adams Cohen Securities,
the underwriting firm on Long Island. It had a piece of flip deals worth
$1.1 billion, or more than half of the total 1993 gross. The dozen flip
deals associated with Adams Cohen  averaged $94.4 million in gross
proceeds.
     Kaplan Associates of Washington led the appraiser group;
deals associated with this firm came to $1.05 billion, almost twice as much
as its next closest competitor, RP Financial Inc. Kaplan flips also had the
biggest gross per appraiser, averaging $75.3 million.
     The lead firms in these groups handled the doozy deals of
1993. When the Coral Gables Federal Savings & Loan Association flipped
early last year, it was the largest  since a few big flips in the mid-
1980s, according to Robert Adams, managing director of Adams Cohen. The
Coral Gables deal was eclipsed at the end of the year by Astoria Federal
Savings Bank in Lake Success, N.Y., only to be eclipsed earlier this year
by the mother of all flips, Green Point Savings Bank with about $6 billion
in assets.
     Muldoon and Adams did both the Astoria and Green Point
deals. Appraising for Astoria was done by Kaplan; RP Financial of
Arlington, Va., the second largest flip appraiser, handled Green Point.
     Close scrutiny of mutual to stock flips by regulators and
members of Congress concerned about excessive insider benefits has these
firms uncertain about what 1994 will hold.
     As to 1994, I would say were very cautious, Adams said. We
dont know where the congressional hearings and legislation [on mutual
flips] will go. He said the firm is keeping an eye to the windward and
diversifying. Were substantially expanding our sales trading activity and
other research work, he said.
     Muldoon predicted a clampdown on merger-conversions, but he
was cautiously optimistic that conversions will continue.

CREDIT UNIONS ARE HEDGING THEIR BETS

The National Credit Union Administration has the authority
to allow AT&T Family Credit Union in North Carolina to serve additional
employee groups, the credit union and Credit Union National Association
claim in a motion made in federal district court in Washington. However,
given the possibility that banks could win the case, the two defendants
also say that even if the banks win, relief should only be prospective.
     AT&T Family and CUNAs brief, filed as a motion for summary
judgment in First National Bank and Trust Co., et al vs. NCUA, No. 90-2948,
is a crucial component of a lawsuit that could have broad legal, political
and competitive implications for both the credit union and banking
industries.
     The American Bankers Association filed the suit on behalf
of First National Bank and Trust, arguing that the Federal Credit Union Act
common bond criteria bars credit unions from expanding their field of
membership beyond their primary service group, that is employees of AT&T in
North Carolina.
     In summing up the banking industrys case, AT&T Family
Credit Union and CUNA put it best:
     The relief sought in plaintiffs complaint includes a
declaration that all amendments to Family Federals charter that were
requested after Nov. 14, 1989 are null and void. Such a declaration would
divest Family Federal of approximately 95 employee groups. These groups
have 34,000 members30.3% of the total membership of the credit union. This
would have a catastrophic effect on Family Federal and its members.
     Besides its argument that NCUAs action was proper and
Family Federals charter is lawful and valid, the Family Federal-CUNA brief
hedges its bets by saying that even if the banks are right, giving banks
what they want would impose harm on the credit union of great magnitude,
while the competitive harm to the plaintiffs that would result from
prospective relief only is negligible.
     The brief added, This requires the court either to rule
that the banks are not entitled to retroactive relief or, at the very
least, to hold an evidentiary hearing to evaluate the relative harms and
other equitable factors such as waiver and estoppel.
     Banks are seeking divestiture because they believe that
credit unions have become unfair competitors because they are not taxed and
yet can offer the same services.

D&OS FACE EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

Giving another kick to one of its favorite political
footballs, Congress has moved to extend the statute of limitations for
civil actions against insiders at failed thrifts.
     Sen. Alfonse M. DAmato, R-N.Y., pushed for the extension as
part of his efforts to keep pressure on the Clinton administration in
regard to White-watergate, the controversy surrounding the role of the
president and his wife in an Arkansas real estate project that was funded
by a savings and loan that later collapsed.
     DAmato offered an amendment Feb. 9 to a supplemental
appropriations bill that allows the Resolution Trust Corp. to bring civil
suits for fraud and gross negligence until Dec. 31, 1995. The Senate
approved the amendment the same day by a vote of 95-0, and on Feb. 11 the
House of Representatives voted 390-1 to instruct their conferees to retain
the amendment.
     This means that those who are potentially liable to the
taxpayers cant hide behind the calendar or a legal technicality, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said. Congress will not
tolerate gross fraud or negligence at the taxpayers expenseno matter who
the culprits are.
     DAmato was joined in offering the amendment by Sens. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
     DAmato said he pushed for the extension for fear that the
statute of limitations would run out by the end of February for cases
involving the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the institution connected
to the Whitewater resort development in Arkansas.
     He cited the administrations repeated failure to provide
any specific information regarding the expiration of the civil statute of
limitations in the Madison/Whitewater controversy.
     Under current law, the statue of limitations for fraud and
gross negligence is five years. DAmatos amendment, certain to pass because
it was attached to a supplemental appropriations bill, extends the statute
of limitations in cases involving failed S&Ls to the same date that the RTC
goes out of business.
     Now that the RTC will have additional time, we must be
concerned that it will use it to conduct a thorough investigation and then
recover some of the billions of dollars taxpayers have poured into the
savings and loan bailout.

DAVID PAUL GUILTY ON SECURITIES CHARGES

Andrew Wheat
In a surprise move David L. Paulwho became a symbol of the
S&L era as the defunct head of the former CenTrust Bankpleaded guilty Feb.
10 to remaining charges in a 100-count indictment.
     Miami-based CenTrust failed in early 1990 at an estimated
taxpayer cost of $1.5 billion. The indictment came two years later and a
jury was selected last October for the first batch of counts that charged
that Paul had diverted bank funds to pay for the work on his mansion and
had obstructed justice. The jury found Paul guilty of many of those
charges.
     The second batch of charges to which Paul just plead guilty
cover racketeering allegations that Paul and his associates misled
regulators and purchasers of CenTrust subordinated debentures about the
underwriting of CenTrust junk bond investments.
     A 1991 FDIC suit against junk bond king Michael Milken
argued that directors of several thrifts, such as Paul, Charles Keating and
Thomas Spiegel, allowed Milken to draw on their funds to support prices and
prevent defaults in his multibillion house of cards. Each of these persons
intended to share in the plunder of their respective institutions and to
obtain other benefits the Milken Group provided to those who purchased
large quantities of Drexel-underwritten junk bonds, the suit said.
     An additional charge in the second batch of Paul charges
was that CenTrust parked a piece of the offering with Bank of Credit and
Commerce International parties to make it appear that it was more heavily
subscribed than it was. Further charges allege that CenTrust transactions
with Charles Keatings Lincoln Savings and Loan contained material
information that was not disclosed to auditors.
     Sentencing is scheduled for April 1, April Fools Day.
There will also be Rico forfeiture proceeding March 21.
     I have a hard timeeven for internal purposesestimating what
kind of sentence he might be faced with, said Allan Sullivan, the assistant
U.S. attorney handling the case. It all is governed by sentencing
guidelines. Its all calculated based on fraud losses, and aggravating or
mitigating factors.
     This marks the conclusion of a successful prosecution
against Paul resulting in his prosecution on Rico charges, Sullivan said.
     In an interview with The Thrift Regulator in October (Oct.
4, page 3) Pauls attorney, Stephen Neal of the Chicago office of Kirkland &
Ellis, said there was no question the bank had paid for work on Pauls
house. But he dismissed the second set of chargesto which his client has
now pleaded guiltyas nonsense put into the indictment solely to soil Pauls
name through guilt by association with Keating and BCCI.
     Neal could not be reached for an updated comment.

PROMPT ACTION ON SUPERFUND LAW SOUGHT

It is doubtful that the banking industry will be successful
in trying to use a negative court decision on the ability of a government
agency to exempt lenders from hazardous waste cleanup suits brought by
private parties as a lever to force Congress to act quickly on a law which
provides that protection. That will mean that for the time being,
persuading judges to read the lender liability exemption in the current
Superfund law broadly is the best way for lenders to reduce their potential
liability for cleanup of hazardous waste.
     One of the reasons prompt action on the legislation, the
Superfund Reau-thorization Law, H.R. 3800 and S. 1834, is unlikely is that
Congress, even under the most optimistic of scenarios, will have little
time to deal with it this year. Second, the misery-loves-company groups
that brought the court suit against the Environmental Protection Agencys
1992 regulation are unlikely to cave in quickly to pressure from the
administration and members of Congress, even though these groups are
acutely aware of the potential economic impact of leaving lenders out to
dry for the damage caused by borrowers to the environment.
     The two groups are state and local governments and the
chemical industry, both with a big stake in having someone with deep
pockets share the blame for cleanup of hazardous waste. The suit is Kelley
vs. EPA. Frank J. Kelley is the attorney general of Michigan. The Chemical
Manufacturers Association was the co-plaintiff in the case.
     The bill does what a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit says the EPA doesnt have the authority to do unilaterally,
establish strict limits on when lenders are liable for hazardous waste
cleanup. But in its Feb. 4 decision, the court held that Congress must
grant EPA the authority to limit lender liability. Otherwise, courts will
determine the extent of lender liability based on the current Superfund
law, the court said. The EPA promulgated the rule in response to the Fleet
Factors decision in the 11th U.S. Circuit in 1990, which imposed liability
on lenders based on the theory that the mere capacity to influence a
borrowers decisionmaking was sufficient to make the lender potentially
liable. It in effect called into question the secured lender exemption in
the original Superfund statute.
     Elliott P. Laws, assistant administrator for the Office of
Solid Waste and Emergency Response at the EPA, testified before a House
panel Feb. 10 that the provisions in the reauthori-zation law regarding
lenders and trustees has assumed a greater level of importance.
     Although the government has not yet determined whether to
seek a rehearing by the full court in the case, the administrations
proposal would confirm EPAs authority to administer the statute in a fair
and effective manner, Laws said. An unnecessary imposition of liability on
lenders and trustees ... would have a chilling effect on the provision of
working capital to otherwise credit-worthy borrowers, or to provide funds
for the purchase of environmentally distressed property. Clear liability
standards for lenders and trustees are necessary elements of the
administrations plan to rehabilitate urban brownfields and to bring
distressed property back into the stream of commerce.
     Besides strictly limiting lender liability, the proposed
legislation would overhaul the manner in which shares of responsibility for
cleanup of hazardous waste would be allocated and provide for expedited
settlements. Laws summed it up this way: The administration intends to
increase fairness and reduce transaction costswith the expectation that
most parties will settle their liability to the U.S. and that more money
will be spent on cleanups, rather than lawyers.
     Under the proposed law an early, expeditious and obligatory
allocation process would be created. Each liable partys share of response
costs would be allocated by a neutral, third-party allocator. The proposed
process is intended to reduce, if not virtually eliminate, the expensive
and time-consuming process of litigating these issues in federal district
court, Laws said. The plan offers substantial incentives to parties who
choose to settle their liability, and disincentives to parties who choose
to litigate following the allocation.
     The American Bankers Association acted strongly against the
court decision and called for prompt action on the legislation. The ABA
said it would seek a rehearing before the full court on the rulingit has
been certified as an intervenorbut industry lawyers believe that is a
holding action aimed at persuading Congress to move quickly on the bill.
The only thing that could yield a rehearing is the still-to-be published
dissent of Chief Judge Abner Mikva to the courts ruling.  ABA and the
government could  seek review from the full court if Mikvas dissent is
strong enough, in the eyes of  ABA and the government, to put enough doubt
in the minds of other members as to warrant rehearing.
