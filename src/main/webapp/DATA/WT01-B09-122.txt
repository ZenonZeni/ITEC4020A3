<B>Project Title: Design and Fabrication of SiC Rectifiers<p>

Performing Organization: Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey </B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Professor Jian Zhao, (908) 445­5240</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P><P>While SiC rectifiers with over 1,000 V capability have been reported they are all based on
vertical structures which make them severely limited in achieving high total current capabilities. At present and in
the near future, these rectifiers may not be practical applications because of the presence of the vertical,
"device­shorting" micropipes in SiC. The demonstrated high voltage rectifiers were typically reported with currents
in the milliampere range because a larger current rectifier would require a larger diode area which inevitably will
include some micropipes, resulting in, not only, a substantially reduced switch voltage, but also unacceptable
uniformity and catastrophic damages. Besides the lack of good control in both epilayer thickness and doping
concentration in the mid 1015 cm­3 range and the maximum 101lm epilayers commercially available make it
impossible, at present time, to fabricate the conventional vertical power rectifiers near 1,000 V with a high current
capability and acceptable uniformity. </P>

<P>In this project, we propose to develop planar SiC pn rectifiers using our recent invention in p+ and n+ SiC formation
by ion implantation. In this two­year project, our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the planar rectifiers and to
develop a fabrication technology suitable for commercial production of SiC power rectifiers with a few tens of
amperes total current and up to 2,400 V capabilities needed for electric vehicles and many other applications.</P>

<P>Contrary to the many ongoing aggressive efforts on developing SiC or Si based IGBTs and MCTs, little effort has
been made to dramatically improve, in comparison to the currently used Si p­In diodes, the performance and
reliability of power rectifiers which are needed for each and every kind of power electronic system. This project
aims at a breakthrough by a factor of 10 to 100 in power semiconductor rectifier performance urgently needed, not
just for immediate use, together with Si­based IGBTs and MCTs, for electric vehicles, but also for the merging high
temperature SiC technologies for future advanced electric vehicles. </P>

<P>At the end of this two­year project, 600 V planar rectifiers with up to a 3­A total current will be developed for 300°C
operation. Preliminary 1,000 V rectifiers, with up to l­A total current, will also be developed.</P>

<P>The most important contribution of this project, if successful, is the demonstration of the feasibility and the
development of the planar SiC rectifier technology which will have widespread applications in almost every kind of
power electronic system. </P>

<P><B>Project deliverables:</B></P> <P>Planar SiC power rectifier of 600 to 1,000 V
</P>
<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P> <P>Expected to begin May 1, 1996 & continue for 2 yrs.
