EXCLUSIVE:  AMEX TESTS SMART CARD

AMERICAN EXPRESS is testing a multiple application chip-based card in
its New York City headquarters, sources have told CI.

The pilot, which began in late December, has processed the first
chip-based credit card transactions in the US. Unlike the card
associations, which are pushing stored-value applications, American
Express has installed T&E (green or gold card), Optima and corporate
accounts on one card. Future applications might include electronic
purse and loyalty programmes, according to a source familiar with the
programme.

The microprocessor chip cards are produced by Solaic, a division of
French-based Group Sligos, and smart card terminals will be provided by
US manufacturer VeriFone and French producer Dassault Electronique.

During the pilot, about 30 to 100 cards are being tested by employees.
At the point of sale, a consumer inserts his/her card into a reader/pin
pad, enters a personal code and selects to which account the purchase
will be billed. American Express' back office has already certified the
VeriFone Omni460 base terminal and the SC450 smart card peripheral.

The card is accepted at the company cafeteria but the test will be
expanded to include other sites within the World Financial Center, a
source said. A table-service restaurant at headquarters will also test
portable terminals manufactured by Dassault.

American Express confirmed that since before Christmas, it has been
operating a small employee test of a multi-application smart credit and
charge card. Fewer than 50 cards were involved, she said, emphasising
that it was not a significant event in the opinion of the company.

American Express has taken a leadership position within the Smart Card
Forum, a US-based multi-industry group set up to advocate the
development of smart card systems. Robert Wesley, who is head of
international smart card business development at Amex, is a member of
the Forum's executive board and head of the travel and entertainment
subcommittee.

Internally, smart cards comprise one section of an advanced payments
group which also oversees ExpressNet, an on-line service which appears
on America Online, a private online computer network.

Another key Amex executive, David Boyles, is head of the prepaid card
subcommittee in addition to leading information technology efforts at
the company's Utah-based Stored Value division, formerly known as the
Travelers Cheque group.

In addition, Boyles' group has internally posted several job openings
for the Salt Lake City site, suggesting the division is preparing for
additional work and that smart card efforts may be consolidated in
Utah. The Stored Value group oversees travellers cheques, Amex Special
Teams, which install purse card systems on college campuses, and Amex
Telecom, which is getting into the prepaid phone card business.

In related news, American Express has secured the co-operation of
MasterCard for terminal interoperability. At a CardTech/SecureTech
regional trade show in San Jose, California, officials from American
Express and MasterCard processed smart card transactions using their
respective cards on a common terminal.

American Express has been eager to be included in the payment system
specification work carried on by Europay International, MasterCard
International and Visa International. The demonstration paves the way
for all bank and Amex smart cards to be processed on one terminal,
satisfying a key demand of the merchant community.

ASIA-PACIFIC:  PYNE RESIGNS AS VISA HEAD

IN A SHOCK announcement, Visa International has revealed that its
president for the Asia-Pacific region, Lindsay Pyne, has resigned.

It is understood that Pyne will leave Visa some time in June. He will
stay on in his current position until the appointment of the new
president for the Asia-Pacific region.

While Visa has said Pyne is leaving "to pursue other business
interests", industry sources have said there have been rumours
circulating for two to three weeks that he had been approached by a
recruitment firm representing an international insurance organisation
operating in the region.

Pyne's resignation comes after having spent just two years at Visa
Asia-Pacific. He was earlier involved in spearheading a major
reorganisation of the Bank of New Zealand. Observers said the
resignation of Visa's most senior executive in Asia could not have come
at a worse time, as MasterCard is perceived to be gaining market share.

Also, sceptics said that for Pyne to leave when Visa is still in the
development stages of a number of important initiatives should concern
members over the long-term direction of the card association. One
source said: "It is a shame to come at a time when members are looking
for stability from the association. There is no continuity with people
resigning, we are not able to follow through with initiatives we are
planning with Visa."

Other member institutions were surprised at the news. Many had not
expected the resignation One banker commented:"They have been going
through a lot of turbulence over the past year. There has been a spate
of senior executive turnover."

PHILIPPINES TARGETED FOR CARD GROWTH

TWO PLAYERS have entered the Philippine cards market in the last year,
confirming predictions that the market is ripe for expansion.

According to the president of the Credit Card Association of the
Philippines, Dennis Legaspi, the country now has a total of 12 players
and the market has grown by 60 percent to 70 percent in the last 12
months to reach 1.5 million cards in force.

In terms of billings, growth in the past year was estimated to be in
the order of 30 percent to 40 percent. Observers are predicting that
growth rates will continue in the 50 percent range in 1996.

LandBank Visa card

One of the new players in the market, LandBank of the Philippines,
recently introduced its first credit card, the LandBank Visa card on
November 13.

To make the card more accessible to prospective cardholders, the income
requirement for the card is P120,000 ($4,600), as compared to the
industry standard of P200,000. Explaining the rationale behind this
strategy, Felicitas Mozo-Dimaano who heads LandBank's card business,
said that there is a large well of "cardable people" who can be tapped.

The LandBank Visa card entitles cardholders to savings on utility bills
when they use the card. In terms of settlement of their outstanding
accounts, special payment features allow cardholders to opt for
payments for costly items worth over P2,000 to be made in three-monthly
increments, up to 24 months.

In addition, a payment scheme known as Lite Payment Option, allows
cardholders to make partial payment of their account of at least 10
percent of their monthly purchases and cash advances. Cardholders can
also withdraw up to P20,000 a day from the bank's ATMs and ATMs from
the Megalink-run network.

PVB Visa card

The Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), one of the Philippines' newest
banks, has also entered the credit card issuing business. An agreement
with Equitable Credit Card Network, an affiliate of Equitable Banking,
has allowed the bank to issue a Visa card by using the former's card
processing capabilities in its card issuing business.

PVB, a private commercial bank owned by 500,000 World War Two veterans,
started operations in August 1992. It issues the Classic and the
Veteran Gold Card, catering to both the middle and upscale markets.

Existing players

As competition increases, some of the more established players are
looking to consolidate their positions by introducing new products or
enhancing existing ones. Bank of the Philippine Islands, one of the top
five issuers, is to roll out the BPI MasterCard later this month.

As for its standard Burgundy card, this will receive a revamp and will
be relaunched to carry a longer repayment period, and a lower minimum
payment of 5 percent of monthly balances. In addition, the bank will
continue to run its successful"Frequent User, Sure Winner" bonus
point/incentive programme until mid-1996.

Citibank, which has 300,000 cards in issue, is banking on its enhanced
customer service to keep its top position in the market. The bank,
which claimed to have achieved a 91 percent score in terms of overall
satisfaction of its customers, has recently introduced the 24-hour
Citicard Banking Center which offers a wide range of banking and credit
card transactions.

Meanwhile, the Far East Bank and Trust Company introduced a new
instalment plan for holders of the FarEastCard. The low interest plan
offers cardholders an instalment limit equivalent to three times their
regular credit limit, up to a maximum of P150,000. In addition, the
bank will waive interest on the first instalment payment.

SINGAPORE BILLINGS HIT ALL-TIME HIGH

DESPITE THE fact that Singapore's retail sector is still in the
doldrums, MasterCard International has just released statistics showing
that billings on MasterCard-branded credit cards during the 1995
pre-Christmas season rose 14 percent from the same period in 1994,
reaching an all-time high of S$34.25 million ($24 million).

The MasterCard-sponsored survey shows transaction figures in all retail
sectors from December 10 through December 23. Statistics also indicated
that mail-order purchases registered a corresponding increase, but at a
faster pace of 82.7 percent, reaching S$409,000.

The international card association said that its analysis of a number
of sectors, including travel and entertainment, retail and services
which comprised health care, education, etc, showed that card spending
on all sectors experienced year-on-year growth in 1995.

The fastest growth was recorded by the service sector which grew by 31
percent, growing from S$3 million in 1994 to S$3.9 million in 1995.
Trailing behind were the travel and entertainment and retail sectors
which grew by 13 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Overall T&E spending in 1994 was S$9.3 million, which jumped to S$10
million in 1995. The retail sector grew from S$17.3 million in 1994 to
S$19.4 million in 1995.

A breakdown of the retail and services sectors showed that growth was
helped by increases in hardware purchases and spending on education
which expanded dramatically by 127 percent and 190 percent
respectively.

GERMANY:  BAHNCARD MISSES TARGET

A SURVEY conducted by German business newspaper Handelsblatt suggests
that Germany's largest co-branding deal between Citibank and Deutsche
Bahn has failed to reach its targets. According to the survey, only 20
percent of the 3 million Bahncard holders have opted for the payment
function which has been on offer since last July.

It is three years since Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railways
operator, introduced the Bahncard, which costs DM220 ($153) and offers
half-price travel for a year.

The product quickly attracted a customer base of more than 3 million
and so impressed the banks that they competed vigorously to provide a
payment function: Citibank was finally selected as the Bahn's
co-branding partner and agreed to offer either a Visa or an Electron
chip at no additional charge.

Citibank acknowledged from the start of the marketing campaign last
July that the deal would be profitable only if cross-selling activities
were successful. Since revolving credit is scarcely used, and there is
no annual fee for the card, Citibank had no prospects of generating
adequate revenue from the card itself.

The bank estimated that 50 percent of existing Bahncard holders would
opt for either Electron or Visa functions and that 1.5 million to 2
million new customers would be won. But Handelsblatt's survey indicates
that the past six months have fallen far short of those goals.

Citibank is refusing to comment on the Handelsblatt survey and also
declines to produce its own figures on the "improved" Bahncard, arguing
that the marketing campaign got off to a slow start. Deutsche Bahn
commented that the marketing figures could not be analysed properly
until the product had been on the market for 12 months.

The marketing campaign hit problems from the start. Citibank signed the
deal with Deutsche Bahn on the assumption that all cards would
automatically carry either the Electron or the Visa function. But after
protests from consumer groups, Citibank said the payment option would
be provided only if customers expressly asked for them.

GERMANY:  GZS SIGNS DEAL WITH VISA

THE TRADITIONAL division between Visa and the German banking community
has ended. Visa has been awarded processing rights to Gesellschaft fur
Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the Eurocard/MasterCard processing centre in
Germany.

In return, processing houses in the Visa camp, such as B+S
Kartenservice may process Eurocard/MasterCard payments, although this
was previously the sole preserve of the GZS.

The deal is regarded as a triumph for the GZS, which recognised some
time ago that it would in future have to compete with its member banks
and their affiliates for card processing work. The bank-owned
organisation responded by investing in new processing systems - and
applying for a Visa processing licence.

Traditionally, most German banks issued Eurocard/MasterCard cards only,
while Visa issuers such as BfG Bank and Berliner Bank were very much
the exception. But now a number of institutions are offering both
Eurocard/MasterCard and Visa. For the processing houses, this is a
chance to win the processing contracts for both Visa and
Eurocard/MasterCard, but also carries the risk of losing existing
business.

The Visa deal is effectively an admission by the GZS that it is now
competing with its own member banks for processing contracts and can no
longer afford to exist on Eurocard/MasterCard business alone.

In recent months most large banking groups have established some sort
of processing capability and, as a result, some savings banks
(Sparkassen) are reported to have cancelled their processing agreements
with GZS altogether.

But the GZS believes the capability to process both Visa and Eurocard
payments will be crucial in future."Dual processing capability will be
a benchmark for measuring the success or failure of card processing
houses," a statement said.

SOUTH AFRICA:  CLICKS ROLLS OUT FIRST NATIONAL LOYALTY CARD

SOUTH AFRICA'S health and beauty store, Clicks, plans to extend use of
its loyalty Clubcard from the Western Cape to the Northern Province at
the end of March. It then plans to take it to national roll-out in July
to be available in all 160 of its stores.

According to Ingrid Bosman, direct marketing manager for the Clicks
Clubcard, the card is "South Africa's first true loyalty card". Before
the launch, Click's management researched the success of direct loyalty
cards in the UK, France, Spain and the US.

Since August 31 1995, 200,000 cards have been given free to customers
and it is expected that this figure will rise to 400,000-600,000 later
this year.

"Customers can't use the card for payments, it's purely for collecting
points," Bosman said. One point is given for every R5 ($1.40) spent
with a minimum of a R10 spend. After three months, if the customer has
collected 50 points, then discounts may be given from 5 percent off
cosmetics and jewellery to 2 percent off all other purchases.

"The discounts are the direct benefit to customers after three months,"
Bosman said. Other advantages include cardholders receiving the Clicks
Christmas catalogue before general release, information on special
sales and promotions and new product launches.

South African retailer Dions had a similar loyalty store card a few
years ago but this was discontinued."In South Africa there are a lot of
private label credit cards and some of them are incurring debt, so we
didn't want this problem. We want to use the card as a marketing tool
and not be bogged down with maintenance," Bosman said.

Interested customers can fill out their enrolment forms in-store where
they are given a card number for immediate use. The card is then put
through the cashier's till when paying for purchases and the card
number is linked to that sale. The card supplier to Clicks is BN Card
Technologies of Johannesburg.

TURKEY THIRD COUNTRY TO OFFER SIGNIA

TURKEY HAS become the third country in Europe after the UK and
Switzerland to offer Europay's exclusive Signia card. It will initially
be offered to selected customers of Garanti Bank and Yapi Kredi with
three other Turkish banks coming on stream later this year.

According to Derya Goknar, Europay's operations manager for East
Europe, "as time passed it became more difficult to differentiate
between Gold and Classic cardholders. So we thought we would recreate
the distinction with the Signia card. We believe that in the next three
years, 3,000 Signia cards will be issued."

Europay already has 400,000 MasterCard cards in Turkey of which 55,000
are Gold cards. It also has 2 million Cirrus/Maestro cards issued by
its 22 member banks.

"Signia is not just a card product but is being positioned as a private
banking product," Mehmet Sezgin, Europay's regional business manager
for Turkey, told CI. He added that about five Turkish banks are
actively researching ways to offer private banking to their selected
clients. "Signia is the first product offered by those banks wanting to
get into private banking and as such is the first product of its kind
on the Turkish market," Sezgin said.

A minimum credit limit of $50,000 is required in order to become a
cardholder and each application must be approved by the bank's board of
directors.

"Our market research in the last year-and-a-half gave a positive
outcome. Yes, there is a market for the Signia card. The packaging
around Gold cards has not been successful and this has been eroding the
higher market segment for Visa and MasterCard," Sezgin added. He
maintained that Eurocard/MasterCard cards have a transaction value 35
percent higher than on Visa cards.

It is expected that the annual fee will be set at $500 with an interest
rate of 16 percent monthly. Inflation in Turkey is currently running at
higher than 100 percent.

TARGA'S EARLY SUCCESS IN ITALY

TARGA, THE co-branded Fiat card issued by Instituto San Paolo di Torino
is surpassing targets, according to preliminary results. The
Eurocard-branded card is said to be generating three times as many
sales as other credit cards.

The card was launched in March 1995 and allows cardholders to
accumulate points which can be redeemed against the purchase of a Fiat
car or other services, such as Lufthansa flights.

Roberto Culasso, product manager responsible for the Targa card at San
Paolo di Torino, said: "The product was the idea of Europay and was
inspired by the General Motors card. It has proved highly suited to the
Italian market.

"The average annual expenditure on the Targa card was running at L2.5
million ($1,500) and L3 million. At the end of last year, we estimated
that average spending on the Targa card was L7 million to L8 million.
The definitive figure will not be available until March this year, but
I would not be surprised if it was higher than our current estimates,"
Culasso said.

Meanwhile, the number of Targa cards in issue passed the 100,000 mark
and additional partners are expected to join the points scheme,
bringing the figure to about ten.

Europay International pointed to the success of the card to illustrate
the wisdom of its decision to work with the Italian banks."Targa
typifies Europay's approach in Italy, where we are to committed to
working closely with the banks. We feel this is more effective than
merely promoting our brand," said Gaetano Carboni, senior area manager
in Southern Europe for Europay.

Recent figures from Europay show that the Italian market is finally
showing signs of growth. Transaction volume for credit and debit cards
in the Europay stable increased by 21 percent in 1995, while the number
of payments went up by 31 percent.

The number of Europay products increased by 15 percent last year, with
the number of debit cards rising to 3.6 million and credit cards going
to 754,000.

Visa, however, continues to dominate the market, with 4.7 million debit
and credit cards in circulation and transaction volume of $7 billion.

FRANCE:  CARTE BLEUE REDESIGNS CARD

THE NATIONAL Carte Bleue card is to take on a new look, giving the bank
logo more prominence. Its logo is to appear as it does on the
International Carte Bleue Visa card (at the bottom, on the right, just
above the hologram).

The new design is an integral part of the Groupement Carte Bleue
strategy designed to relaunch the Carte Bleue brand in synergy with the
print advertising campaign launched last autumn in national magazines
(See CI 142).

The redesigning of the domestic-only Carte Bleue card appears as one of
the major plans in support of the Groupement Carte Bleue's press
advertising campaign in the national magazines, said the company. In
fact, the overall design of the cards belonging to the Carte Bleue
range has to follow a certain logic and be coherent with the clearly
defined brand policy, it added.

In addition to the appearance of the Carte Bleue logo on the front of
the card and to the increased amount of space available for bank
branding, the other components of the changed design are as follows:

- the horizontal hologram in the middle of the card is to become a
square hologram in the right-hand column, as on international cards,
with the original design: this new hologram will appear on all French
bank cards designed for domestic use;

- the CB logo, symbol of interoperability and of acceptance among
French retailers, will occupy the space at the top, on the right, above
the hologram.

Jean-Marc Bornet, chief executive of Groupement Carte Bleue, told CI:
"This change in the visual aspect of the Carte Bleue Nationale (a
product already in use among nearly 5 million customers), is part of
the Groupement's long-term policy of concentrating the range of cards
on the Carte Bleue brand, which is greatly appreciated by French
people.

"This focusing on Carte Bleue as well as the greatly increased
co-operation with Visa are the two poles of a policy designed to
improve the Carte Bleue members' profits through the increase in the
value of their products".

HOUSEHOLD, WAGONLIT CO-BRAND

HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL is to co-brand corporate T&E cards with Carlson
Wagonlit Travel, the second-largest travel agency in the world, in a
partnership that targets a market dominated by American Express.

Household Bank is well known as the seventh-largest bank card issuer
and a leader in co-branding, such as the GM and Pacific Bell card
programmes. It has also become one of the leading issuers of MasterCard
corporate cards in the US with 127,000 cards.

The Illinois-based finance company initiated corporate card programmes
for its co-branding partners, including General Motors and two of its
subsidiaries, Electronic Data Services and Hughes Corporation.
Household also issues cards for Ameritech, Palomar Products, and for
itself.

As part of the exclusive partnership, Carlson will market its cards to
multinational corporations based in the US starting this quarter, to
European countries in the second quarter and in Asia and elsewhere in
1997. Household Limited, a credit card bank in the UK, gives the
company a foothold in Europe. Carlson Wagonlit operates the Carlson
Travel Network, AT Mays in the UK and Viajes Ecuador in Spain.

The Household deal is also a victory at the expense of First Bank
Systems, which was Carlson's co-brand partner from 1993. That
relationship ended in December. First Bank remains the leader among
bank T&E card issuers with 575,000 commercial cards and 250,000
purchasing cards branded by Visa. American Express, however, dominates
the commercial T&E market with more than 7 million cards.

Carlson Wagonlit, which is based in Minneapolis and Paris reported $12
billion in sales last year with 4,000 locations in 125 countries. The
agency will contribute its extensive corporate client list and its
travel service.

A Household spokesman said the companies had created a fully integrated
reporting package that goes beyond turnkey software provided by
MasterCard.

Co-branded corporate cards are a rarity, since T&E cards do not earn
interest income from revolvers and so do not generate the same profit
dynamics as consumer credit cards.

Wells Fargo Bank and Cincinnati-based Star Bank last year introduced
commercial cards with travel rewards built in, but neither involved a
leading player such as Carlson.

UNITED STATES:  CITI TESTS UNBRANDED CARD

CITIBANK, THE world's largest bank card issuer, has broken with
tradition by launching a non-Citibank-branded card, under the banner of
"CBSD". This stands for Citibank South Dakota, one of the New York City
money centre's issuing banks.

Citibank has solicited customers with an unbranded Visa gold card that
makes no mention of the bank, with the exception of some fine print
among the terms and conditions.   The offer represents a major shift in
strategy for a bank that has heavily promoted its name for years. But a
bank spokeswoman denied that Citibank was changing its long-term
strategy of promoting the bank brand.

"It's not a strategy but rather a test to reaffirm how important the
brand is. We do things like this to gauge customer reactions," she
said. The bank regards the test as being no different than offering
different combinations of fee, service and interest rates to different
customers.

In 1986, Citibank purchased the Choice card programme which featured a
rate lower than the standard Citibank Visa card but without any extra
benefits. It was offered to customers with exceptional credit records
in the era shortly before the upsurge in competition.

The CBSD card offered a 4.9 percent teaser rate for six months, no
annual fee and up to $15,000 credit limit. The rate increased to 5.4
percent above prime.

In recent months, Citibank has invested more heavily in its cards
business, which began growing in the latter half of 1995 after several
years of stagnation. It has also been promoting its name in new ways,
dropping its familiar Citibank Visa advertisements in favour of the
bank name alone.

MARINE MIDLAND EXPANDS ADVANTAGE PROGRAMME

IN AN EFFORT to keep its most profitable customers, Marine Midland Bank
has launched a rewards programme, called MarineAdvantage.

Midland Marine, a Buffalo, New York-based subsidiary of HSBC Holdings,
introduced the loyalty programme this month. It plans to solicit the
remainder of its portfolio by offering the same value-added rewards
programme for a fee.

The result is a seven-tier rewards scheme whereby cardholders can
redeem points accumulated through charge activity. The programme, which
features rewards offered by retail, travel and dining partners, mirrors
one offered by its UK-based parent Midland Bank.

Peter Davidson, executive vice president and head of consumer banking
at Marine Midland said it is essential to retain lucrative customers
already on the books. "The approach we take in customer management is
one of determining who our most profitable customers are and
determining what it is that attracts those people," he said.

Marine Midland divides its portfolio into four categories of revenue
generation: highly profitable; moderately profitable; marginally
profitable, or those which cover variable costs; and the unprofitable,
which do not cover fixed or variable costs.

Davidson said Marine Midland is looking to "put a wall up" around its
core customers. "In most cases, 20 percent of the portfolio generates
100 percent of the profits," he said. Those accounts that are marginal
or unprofitable should be charged fees or higher rates to either make
them more profitable or encourage the customers to close their account.

Because of the fierce competition in the market, it may be very costly
to replace one good customer. "If you have a highly profitable
customer, that customer may generate upwards of $300, $400 or $500 a
year for the bank. To lose one of those, you might need ten average
customers. If you could spend on an existing account what you would on
a new account, then that is well worth your while."

The MarineAdvantage programme also addresses the attrition of
value-conscious customers, those who have been lured away by co-branded
schemes. "We already addressed the needs of price conscious and service
conscious customers," he said.

Marine Midland consumer research found cardholders preferred fun or
out-of-the-ordinary rewards, and rewards that are attainable sooner
rather than later. This self-branded programme is administered by
Maritz of Missouri, a third party that developed card-based employee
incentive programmes.

Davidson also said Marine Midland will test ways of getting rid of
unprofitable customers in the second quarter of this year. "One
approach is to price them, to the point where they accept the terms or
leave - a $50, $75 or $100 fee," he said.

All of this suggests that Marine Midland, too, hopes to tap into the
booming credit card business. The bank is just starting to make a dent
in the marketplace, growing its loans by $300 million last year to $1.8
billion in receivables, placing it among the 30 largest US portfolios.
"We see cards as a very profitable product, when managed properly, and
we feel it is still a growth business, what with the new uses that are
coming about."

Still, Davidson acknowledged several danger signs that have emerged at
the end of 1995: a dip in consumer confidence and a slight rise in
personal bankruptcies and charge-off rates."It may be time to be a
little cautious and concentrate on finding the best customers that are
out there in the marketplace, given signs that the economy perhaps is
softening a little bit. I don't think there are any disasters out there
yet, but it's a good time to be prudent."

CITIBANK FORD CARD REACHES 4.4 MILLION TARGET

CITIBANK'S FORD credit card programme, usually in the shadow of its
more successful rival issued by Household Bank/General Motors, is
finally coming into its own.

According to annual surveys conducted by Brittain Associates, a
marketing consultancy based in Atlanta, Ford's rebate and marketing
partner strategies are having the desired effect, with the number of
cards reaching 4.4 million, an increase of 350,000 accounts since 1994.

Both Texaco petrol and Hertz Rental Car sales have enjoyed increased
sales as a result of Ford Citibank cardholders seeking to build up
rebate points faster.

The study is good news to card issuers, since it shows that allied
marketing partners do benefit from their association with card
programmes while at the same time they add value to the programme. "By
all appearances, it's a win-win-win situation for Ford, Citibank and
their marketing partners," said Bruce Brittain, president of the
consultancy.

"We have seen a net 7 percent growth in the number of accounts in the
past 12 months and evidence that their revolvers are carrying larger
balances. These are healthy signs for the portfolio," Brittain said.

In a separate survey, Brittain also noted that American Express' Optima
True Grace has grown 45 percent since April or an additional 500,000
accounts. The study suggested that American Express is reaching a
younger, less affluent segment than its traditional business.

Meanwhile, the quietly successful General Electric Rewards card may
have declined as much as 20 percent in the same six month period.
Brittain says that once again, changes to the card's rebate schemes
trigger cardholder behaviour. In this case, rebates were remitted as an
annual cheque starting July 1995, rather than coupons to be used with
marketing partners. If a programme change is to blame, Brittain
explained, then he expects the portfolio numbers to rebound in the
coming months.

Petrol rebate cards continue to perform well. Chemical Bank's Shell Oil
card enjoyed a 15 percent increase in accounts in the last nine months.
Virtually all of the accounts are new to Chemical's portfolio (soon to
be called Chase Manhattan) and two-thirds were already Shell
proprietary customers who were converted.

According to the survey, the GE Exxon card has only attracted 250,000
cards in its first year, a quarter of the size of the Shell programme
after the same duration. Brittain found that Exxon, unlike Shell, did
not market the card to its entire proprietary portfolio.

SPONSORSHIPS YIELD RICH HARVEST

Credit card companies have joined brewers and cigarette makers as some
of the most active sponsors of sporting and entertainment events in the
world. Joseph A Giannone reports

WITH ADVERTISING and other marketing channels growing increasingly
cluttered, credit card issuers and organisations are seeking to
increase their profile through sponsorship of major events. Sporting
events are being selected to market cards and the brands as well as tap
into some of the enthusiasm fans have for their sports.

Exclusivity does not come cheap, however. According to IEG Sponsorship
Report, a newsletter covering the sponsorship trade, Visa International
spent between $30 million and $35 million on sponsorship rights on the
National Football League, the Elton John tour and some destination
deals.

MasterCard is spending $10 million to $15 million towards the soccer
World Cup in 1998, the National Hockey League and several golf
competitions. MasterCard and its members spent a combined $75 million
in relation to World Cup 1994.

Card sponsorships took off in 1984 when American Express was a leading
sponsor to the Olympics, according to Jim Andrews of IEG, a consultancy
specialising in sponsorships. But in 1988 Visa took over lead
sponsorship and has subsequently generated great success by exploiting
its exclusive sponsorship rights.

Sponsorship activity grew heated this year, as the two associations and
American Express each landed one among three major sports leagues. In
April 1995, Visa announced its deal with the National Football League
with an estimated value of $50 million over five years. Visa this
summer created tie-ins as the official card of Triple Crown horse
racing.

American Express in May signed on with the National Basketball League,
paying $30 million for three years. It also signed a sponsorship deal
with the Dallas Cowboys football club to be the official card of Texas
Stadium, though Visa has rights bestowed by the league.

The most recent industry deal was scored by MasterCard in December with
a four-year, $2 million exclusive deal with the National Hockey League.
MasterCard is touting its gold cards at several title golf tournaments,
such as the PGA Grand Slam and the Colonial.

Likewise, the NHL hockey and NASCAR automobile racing circuit will be
used to promote standard cards. Three more golf title sponsorships are
pending, a MasterCard spokeswoman said.

Visa and MasterCard continued their worldwide sponsorship commitments.
Visa paid $40 million for the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.

MasterCard seized on World Cup soccer as a global marketing platform.
It paid $10 million to sponsor the 1998 championships in France,
according to IEG. A four-year package of associated sponsorships
leading up to the games is worth $40 million.

Credit card groups are not alone in seizing on sponsorship as a new way
of doing business, according to Jim Andrews, an IEG vice president.
Sponsorship spending will top $5.4 billion in the US next year, 15
percent more than the $4.7 billion projected to be spent in 1995.

Sponsorships have become popular as a rallying point for everything a
company does. For MasterCard and Visa, the World Cup and Olympics have
formed the cornerstone promotions used by members as well as the
associations.

"In sponsorships, it's not just what you have, it's what you do with
it," said Mava Heffler, MasterCard senior vice president in charge of
sponsorships. MasterCard, she said, has expanded its soccer sponsorship
to include a broadcast television soccer report and markets the brand
as host of smaller events leading up to the World Cup championships.

"The current level of activity can be traced to the Olympics, in terms
of what it has done for sponsors in a number of ways. Companies have
found that whenever they ran promotions to make donations to the teams,
their usage went up," Andrews said.

The big winner in all of this, though, may be Delaware-based MBNA
America, the second-largest bank card issuer in the US and king of
affinity credit cards. At the same time as Visa secured the NFL spot,
MBNA was chosen as the issuer for 30 professional football franchises.
Likewise, MBNA has been tapped by MasterCard to issue cards for all 26
hockey teams.

ADVANTA LOOKS AT GLOBAL EXPANSION

Advanta Corporation, one of the fastest growing credit card issuers in
the US, is getting serious about reproducing its success in other
countries. Joseph A Giannone reports

ADVANTA IS joining the swelling ranks of US non-bank credit card
issuers that are expanding beyond national boundaries. Last year,
Advanta formed a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland to issue
cards in the UK. And that, according to Advanta International head Jim
Allhusen, is just the beginning.

"International business will be a key part of corporate expansion and
it will be a major part of our strategy. We plan to be opportunistic
when we find markets that are inefficient or stagnant," Allhusen said.

Within the US, the limited-purpose credit card issuer based near
Philadelphia has jumped into the elite top 20 while it continues to
outperform the industry. Advanta managed $11.9 billion in assets at the
end of the third quarter, making it the 13th-largest issuer in the US.
In the first nine months of 1995, the company added 1 million new
accounts for a total of more than 4 million.

The company, which has its roots in making loans to educators in
Pennsylvania, has recruited several industry luminaries with
international credentials. Most notably, former MasterCard
International chief executive Alex "Pete" Hart joined in 1994 and was
subsequently named CEO of the company.

Hart has since lured two association colleagues to join him: Arthur
Kranzley, formerly head of MasterCard's worldwide debit business, who
came on board in the autumn.

Earlier this month, the company hired Hung-Fu "Hank" Chiang, who left
his post as general manager of MasterCard China. Chiang also had worked
with Hart at First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles.

Chiang, an American of Chinese descent, will report to James Allhusen,
an executive vice president in charge of Advanta International, a
newly-formed group. Allhusen, who ran consumer banking and cards for
Standard Chartered Bank, came on board last year. His career includes
stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Allhusen noted that Hart, Chiang and he all have expertise and contacts
in Asian markets. He said people were now in place to develop an Asian
strategy. When asked if a China strategy were in place at Advanta,
Allhusen replied, "No, not yet."

But company executives speak openly of plans for global expansion by
way of joint ventures with indigenous partners in certain high-growth
markets. Unlike Citibank, MBNA or Household International, which have
set up issuing banks in target markets, Advanta will seek to create
ventures with like-minded banks as it did with Royal Bank of Scotland
last year.

"We believe Advanta has skills within the company which have made it
very successful in the US. We see opportunities in foreign markets to
use those same skills to our advantage. My job is to find out which
skills are most transportable across borders and to find partners we
could work with in those markets," said Allhusen, naming RBS as an
example.

Royal Bank, he said, "is just as committed to the success of the
proposition, has a strong image, a strong brand and an infrastructure
to support a cards operation. What we bring is a number of skills that
have not yet been developed in the UK market."

In recent months, Advanta has been more aggressive in seeking
publicity, another sign that the company seeks recognition as a leading
cards player.

Allhusen said the increase is coincidental, since the company recently
has had much to proclaim. Advanta has a motive in trying to earn the
favour of Wall Street to boost its share price, a tactic recently
employed by First USA. News of international expansion could help
rectify a depressed price-earnings ratio of 12.5, which according to
Allhusen is"lower than it ought to be."

Along with the other pure plays, Advanta's Class A stock took a plunge
at the end of December, dropping to $38 per share from an October high
of $49.

According to analysts pure play companies such as Advanta, which derive
almost 100 percent of their revenues from credit cards, have suffered
from recent reports that make gloomy predictions for the future. In the
last few quarters, charge offs and personal delinquency rates have
crept upward on average, though individually Advanta's loss experience
has been better than the industry as a whole.
