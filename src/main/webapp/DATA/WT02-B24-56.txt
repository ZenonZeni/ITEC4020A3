<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Transition Services</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee 
<br>December 1993</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Transition Services&quot; means a coordinated set of activities
for a student, designed within an outcome-oriented process, that promotes
movement from school to post-school activities, including postsecondary
education, vocational training, integrated employment (including supported
employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent
living, or community participation. </p>

<p>The reauthorization of Public Law 94-142, now referred to as the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, PL 101-476), in 1990, left no questions
as to the necessity for including transition services in the educational
program for all students with disabilities. In Section 602(a)(20) of IDEA,
the need for stating specific strategies to effect successful transition
is mandated (paragraph D). Transition planning must be included in the
Individualized Education Program (IEP) beginning at age sixteen and continuing
until the student leaves school, possibly as late as age twenty-one. The
transition goals are to be specified in an Individualized Transition Plan
(ITP) as part of the IEP process. The ITP itself may be outlined in a separate
document that is considered to be part of the IEP, or the ITP goals can
be specified in the main IEP document. </p>

<p>In high schools, transition services have traditionally been available
only to the most promising students. High school guidance counselors spend
approximately thirty per cent of their time working with the students who
are college-bound. Legislation now demands that students with disabilities
(including students with learning disabilities) who may or may not be college-bound
have the same level of services available to them. Providing transition
services within the school may require that not only the guidance counselor
and the special educator be part of the IEP team. Regular education personnel,
vocational educators, speech and language professionals and other specialists
may need to provide information or participate in writing the IEP to make
the planning process as comprehensive as possible. </p>

<p>Beyond simply meeting the mandates of the law, transition planning requires
a change in how school personnel view students with disabilities and how
they prepare those students for adulthood. Simply moving students forward
within the school system does not provide the type of guidance and preparation
necessary for transition to adult roles in the community. Clear and specific
goals must be identified early. The law stipulates that should there be
a need, transition planning can begin as early as age fourteen. Many transition
specialists, however, maintain that even age fourteen is very late and
that planning should begin as soon as the disability is identified. </p>

<p>The student and the parents must be involved in the ITP process. A wide
range of options should be considered based on the student's interests,
skills, and abilities, not just the student's disabilities. Also, the need
for services beyond what the school provides must be considered and appropriate
representatives from the community should be part of the ITP process. Appropriate
members of the community may include persons from Vocational Rehabilitation,
potential employers, service agency representatives, and personnel from
institutions of higher education. </p>

<p>Even though outside agencies may participate in the process, it is still
the local education agency (i.e. the school system) that has ultimate responsibility
for implementing the plan. Should outside agencies not provide the support
required, the school system then is required to reconvene the IEP team
to identify alternative strategies to meet the objectives outlined in the
IEP (34 C.F.R. Section 300.347). </p>

<p>Transition planning, used effectively, can increase the number and type
of options open to students with learning disabilities. By accurately assessing
students' interests, skills, and abilities early, students, parents, educators
and other professionals can work together to make sure that all school
experiences help move students toward successful adulthood. </p>

<p>Note: Final regulations for IDEA can be found in the September 29, 1992
Federal Register (Vol. 57, No. 189 pp. 44794-44852). </p>
