Dear Mr. Olsen: 
     Thank you for your letter of November 26, 1995 and the 
enclosed materials.  I am glad that you  took the time to share 
your thoughts with me. 
     As a doctor, I understand the terrible suffering experienced 
by victims of diseases such as AIDS  and cancer.  Many patients 
find it difficult that their loss of appetite results in 
significant weight loss,  often threatening their health. 
     Earlier this year, Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts 
introduced legislation to permit the  therapeutic use of 
marijuana for certain patients.  Under current law, marijuana is 
considered a Class  I drug and cannot be prescribed for any 
medical condition.  There are, however, several prescription  
drugs that use the same active ingredient as is found in 
marijuana.  I will be sure to keep your support  for Congressman 
Frank’s legislation in mind if it comes before the House for 
consideration. 
     Thank you again for your letter.  I hope to hear from you 
again on other issues of mutual concern. 
     Sincerely,
     Greg Ganske, M.D.
