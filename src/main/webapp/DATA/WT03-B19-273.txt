<FONT SIZE="+2">
The lure of gold was a magnet drawing people from all over the
world to Ballarat in the 1850s.
<P>
The rush to the Ballarat goldfields and other discoveries nearby
gave enormous impetus to Victoria's population growth. It also
established Ballarat as a major business and commercial centre.
<P>
Today, Ballarat is the natural service centre for a large part
of western Victoria, and the City of Ballarat is the region's
main centre for professional, commercial, education, health and
welfare services.
<P>
With an urban population of more than 93,000, Ballarat is Australia's
second largest inland city and the regional &quot;capital city&quot; of
western Victoria.

<H2>Golden beginnings</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/brat1.gif" align=right>
The economic base of Greater Ballarat reflects its past foundations
on mining, manufacturing, services and commerce.
<P>
Secondary industries and manufacturing enterprises have continued
to grow since the 1850s. Initially, capital accumulated from gold
production was used to establish manufacturing industries servicing
the mines, but as agriculture developed, manufacturing industries
expanded to produce machinery, equipment and processing for farming.
<P>
Community services such as health and education, wholesale and
retail trade and manufacturing account for 60 per cent of the
population's employment.
<H2>Diverse manufacturing base</H2>

<P>
Ballarat and District has responded to the challenges of structural
change in manufacturing by expanding and diversifying. Major sectors
of the local economy include: agriculture, tourism, community
services, manufacturing, wholesale/retail, education and health.
<P>
Although service related industries have grown over the last ten
years, manufacturing still plays an important part in the region's
economic future, employing about 15.2 per cent of the total workforce.
In 1991, more than 5,000 people were employed in manufacturing.
<P>
Key industries include food processing, gold mining, clay and
mineral extraction, metal manufacturing and agriculture based
industries.
<p>
<H2>A place to grow</H2>

<P>
Agriculture is the region's major land-use activity and is a significant
contributor to its economy.  Because Ballarat has a diversity
of soil types, topography, rainfall and weather patterns, the
region's primary industry is diverse and productive.  Produce
includes wool, beef, lambs, oats, barley, potatoes and dairy products.
 Other important enterprises include apiculture, pig farming,
oil-seed cropping, fresh fruit, vegetables, grapes and cut flowers.
<P>
Even though the region has a well developed and diverse agricultural
sector, great potential exists to increase processing and manufacturing
of local produce.
<P>
An excellent example of value-added produce is the McCains Australia
plant, producing French fries and prepared frozen meals.  During
its peak season, McCains employs about 650 people.  The company
processes more than half the local potato production.
<P>
Apart from renewed interest by a number of companies in investigating
the potential and feasibility of future gold mining in the region,
extracting and processing clay and minerals offers companies immediate
opportunities for development.
<P>
Local clays are already an important economic resource.  Selkirk
Brick and the Eureka Tile Company use local clays for their raw
materials.  Potential exists for mining high grade kaolin, which
also occurs locally.  Kaolin deposits at Pittong and Lal Lal are
mined by Kaolin Australia Ltd, a subsidiary of English China Clay,
and the company's processing plant produces a range of products
used in ceramics, paper, prints and rubber.
<H2>District advantages</H2>
<P>
The region has a number of advantages attractive to industry.
 First and foremost are the services and infrastructure that provide
a sound base from which industry can grow.
<P>
Four major highways converge at Ballarat.  The Western Highway
links Ballarat to Melbourne (111 kilometres), by a high quality,
continuous, four-lane freeway that reduces travel time between
the two cities to about 75 minutes.
<P>
The Western Highway bypass around Ballarat reduces congestion 
and gives Ballarat airport's industrial
area better access to Melbourne.  The airport has three runways
and offers 24-hour landing facilities.
<P>
The Midland Highway gives access to Geelong to the south and Bendigo
to the north. The Sunraysia Highway links the region with Mildura,
and the Glenelg Highway connects it to Mt Gambier in South Australia
via Hamilton.
<P>
V-Line provides fast track freight services by road and rail to
the ports of Melbourne and Geelong. More than sixty transport
companies provide local businesses with an extensive range of
road transport services.
<P>
Ballarat's urban sewerage system can accommodate new development,
and the town's water supply can cope with a further 40,000 people.
The urban area is serviced by two main water supplies: a gravity
system, centred on the Moorabool and White Swan Reservoirs; and
a supply pumped from the Lal Lal Reservoir. The quality of this
water is excellent for both domestic and industrial use.
<P>
Electricity is in ample supply to meet the demands of most major
industries within the developed area, and distribution feeders
can be supplied for industries outside this area. A major natural
gas pipeline supplies Ballarat, and can be extended to meet the
needs of industry as required.
<H2>Community services</H2>

<P>
Ballarat and District offers its residents excellent health, welfare
and education services. Health and welfare services include the
Ballarat Base Hospital, St John of God Private Hospital and the
Queen Elizabeth Geriatric Centre.
<P>
Ballarat's education facilities provide for pre-school to post
secondary education, with a variety of private and public schools.
Tertiary institutions include the University of Ballarat, the
Ballarat School of Mines and Industries and the Catholic University
Aquinas College.
<P>
Twenty-six government and thirteen non-government primary schools,
and six government and eight non-government secondary schools
provide the region with an excellent education system.

<H2>A solid base for growth</H2>

<P>
The breadth and depth of the region's construction industry attracts
a great deal of investment, and the Ballarat Business Directory
lists more than 350 construction businesses. They include building
and construction, concreting, bricklaying and roof and wall tiling
companies, as well as other companies providing more specialised
trade services such as structural steel erection and plumbing
and electrical work.
<P>
Ballarat has been recognised by the State Government as a location
to which new, high-technology enterprises will be directed. The
Victorian Government is outsourcing the Public
Transport and Vic Roads computer work to private enterprise in
Ballarat. The city is also the site for the Victorian Government's
State Data Centre, specialising in geographic information systems.
<P>
The Ballarat Technology Research and Development Park covers nearly
seven hectares adjoining the University of Ballarat, and tenants
of the Park will have access to the University's facilities.
<P>
Ballarat has targeted industry with its initiative to establish
the Wendouree Garden Industrial Estate, where blocks are available
for manufacturing firms. A substantial quantity of industrial
land is available locally with all on-site services provided.
<P>
Commercial activity is dominated by the Ballarat Central Business
District, and the city draws on a regional catchment population
of more than 120,000. An extensive range of convenience and specialty
shops caters to most needs.
<H2>Golden future</H2>
<P>
Tourism is a big winner for Ballarat, and plays an important part
in the local economy. Tourist attractions such as Sovereign Hill,
the Eureka Stockade, Ballarat Wildlife Park and the Ballarat Fine
Arts Gallery bring thousands of visitors to the region annually.
<P>
Ballarat has a vast range of indoor and outdoor recreation facilities
for residents and visitors, and the surrounding forests offer
bushwalking, rock climbing, picnicking, fishing and fossicking.
