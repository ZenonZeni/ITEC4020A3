<P>
The two basic options for the management of used fuel are direct disposal or reprocessing.  These give rise to different radioactive residues. 
Used fuel for <I>direct disposal</I> is long-lived high level solid waste.  The whole fuel assembly is treated as waste.  It is stored and cooled until its radioactivity and heat output have reduced enough to simplify handling, before it is ready for packaging and final disposal.  These storage and subsequent conditioning operations generate intermediate and low level waste. 
<P>
Before <I>reprocessing</I>, the used fuel is stored for some five to ten years at reactor sites or reprocessing plants. During reprocessing, uranium and plutonium are separated.  The following intermediate and high level wastes will be generated during the different processes: 
<UL>
<LI>Liquid, high level, long-lived waste.  This is mainly the fission products and actinides other than uranium and plutonium. 
<LI>Liquid, intermediate level long-lived waste from the various separation processes.
<LI>Solid, intermediate level waste, such as fuel claddings etc.
</UL>
The methods used to deal with these are described later. In addition, there will be a variety of low-level wastes. 
<P>
Liquid, high level waste is stored in cooled tanks for a number of years before being solidified by a vitrification process.  Steel containers holding the vitrified waste are then stored, typically for 30 to 50 years, in air-cooled vaults for the decay heat to reduce.  Concepts for its final geological disposal have been developed, and its safety has been evaluated. 
<P>
Low and intermediate level liquid waste.  The effluents other than high level waste are sent to a waste treatment plant where they are stored in different tanks, depending on their nature.  Two types of treatment can be used for decontamination: chemical precipitation or evaporation.  Sludges, flocs and evaporator concentrates are solidified by being cast in cement, resins or bitumen. 
<P>
The waste is either finally disposed of or, more usually, temporarily stored pending final disposal in a repository. 
<P>
Solid wastes from reprocessing, such as fuel claddings, are encapsulated into cement or bitumen before storage or disposal.
