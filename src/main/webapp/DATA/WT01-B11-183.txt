<B>MNR Moves to Conserve Fisheries Resource




</B>

</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced that the ministry plans to manage commercial fishing by issuing commercial fishing licences to two Aboriginal communities in the waters around the Bruce Peninsula.<P>

"In keeping with its commitment to finding a resource management solution that is fair and equitable, and which respects the legal rights of First Nations, MNR is instituting a regulated system that we believe fairly accommodates these rights.  At the same time, it will provide for a healthy, sustainable fishery that will benefit all the people of Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

Mr. Justice Fairgrieve's 1993 decision regarding Aboriginal fishing in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay accepted the Crown's right to regulate fishing for the purposes of conservation and resource management, and that the Aboriginal right to fish was not an exclusive right.<P>

Through the commercial licences, the ministry is providing the two First Nations 50 per cent of the commercially allowable Bruce Peninsula catch. This is equivalent to approximately 540,000 kilograms (1.2 million pounds) of fish, mostly whitefish and chub.  Chinook salmon, rainbow trout and brown trout are not included in any provincial commercial allocations.<P>

"The ministry is providing  a fair and reasonable allocation to First Nation commercial fishers in the waters around the Bruce Peninsula," Mr. Hodgson said. <P> 

Since 1993, MNR has spent approximately $2 million on commercial fishing buyouts and leasebacks for the waters surrounding the Bruce Peninsula. In addition, the ministry spent $400,000 on pre-negotiation discussions which took place with the two First Nations in 1994 and 1995.<P>

"We would have preferred a negotiated arrangement with the two First Nations.  However, the reasonable efforts by both this government and the previous one, including the provisions of thousands of dollars to support discussions with the First Nations, were unsuccessful." Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

MNR will regulate the Bruce Peninsula Aboriginal fishery by issuing a commercial fishing licence under the Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations (ACFLR), a mechanism designed by the federal government following the Supreme Court of Canada <B>Sparrow</B> decision.  The ACFLR are applicable in Quebec and Ontario, as well as in federally managed fisheries across the country.  They also permit the First Nations flexibility and are best suited to communal use, while ensuring that the commercial fishery is regulated, and fish stocks are protected.<P>

MNR has been in discussion with the First Nations regarding fishery management for three years without reaching a negotiated solution.  This decision is unique to the area and does not affect other First Nations in the province.<P>

In the recent <B>R v. Nikal</B> case, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that licensing is a necessary first step to the preservation and management of the fisheries resources and that licensing will not of itself constitute an infringement of Aboriginal rights.<P>
