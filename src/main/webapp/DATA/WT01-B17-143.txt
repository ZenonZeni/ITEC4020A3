<P>





With the alarming and continuous spread of dysfunction and illness among American adults in the 1990s, it’s reasonable to wonder whether some of the seeds of these problems might be sown in infancy—in fact, in the very process of birthing. According to cranial osteopath, Carlisle Holland, D.O., of the Santa Rosa Medical Group in Santa Rosa, California, the answer is yes.<p>
Among the many infants Dr. Holland has treated, he has observed a relationship of prime importance; that is, between distortions in the baby’s skull, often produced by the birthing process itself, and later health problems, such as colic, seizures, eye asymmetry, even autism. This is alarming because the incidence of soft tissue injury to newborns during birth approaches epidemic scale in this country, says Dr. Holland.<p>
Dr. Holland estimates that perhaps 80% of American newborns have a functional problem with the way their muscles, bones, and nervous system work together and that the majority of these neuromusculoskeletal dysfunctions happen in the birthing process. While the majority self-correct, about 15% require treatment. This underlines the need for screening because most problems are correctable by cranial osteopathy, a technique of gentle manipulation by the hands of muscles and bones (including the 33 spinal vertebrae), particularly the bones of the skull.<p>
The newborn’s skull is soft and highly malleable, says Dr. Holland. For many months after birth, the 13 bones (or plates) of the infant’s skull remain quite flexible, more like a thick starch than solidly knit bone. The trouble here is that slight to serious injuries to the baby’s delicate skull during birth can produce distortions and deformities in the arrangement of its bones. <p>
This in turn interferes with the natural flow of energy and cerebrospinal fluid from the base to the top of the spine. It’s what osteopaths call the cranial rhythmic impulse or CRI (sometimes known as the cranio-sacral pump). High-tech brain scans have confirmed what osteopaths have claimed for a century, that there are regular pulsations or physiological motions up and down the spine between the sacrum and cranium that are vital to the well-being of the body. Anything that interferes with this pulsation or CRI, such as a head or neck injury or skull distortion from birth, can lead to more serious functional problems and illness.<p>

<b>DISTORTIONS IN THE SOFT SKULL OF THE NEWBORN</b><p>
There are many risk factors that can lead to cranial distortions in infants, says Dr. Holland: the infant is the firstborn, there is a rapid or prolonged labor or a difficult delivery, forceps were used, Cesarean section was needed, the mother was ill, it was a high risk pregnancy or premature delivery, the birth was one of twins or triplets, the infant had an early childhood illness—any of these can predispose a newborn to cranial injury. <p>
This is where osteopathy can make a significant contribution. “Our  approaches are not only cost-effective, but offer a medically-based but medication-free way to interrupt functional and nervous system  problems of small children,” Dr. Holland states. The reflexes of the autonomic nervous system play a central role in many problems experienced by infants. “Neuromuscular reflex imbalances are what cause many of the functional problems that pediatricians routinely medicate in children. Osteopathic manipulation  can affect cranial nerves and  rebalance autonomic reflex disturbances, thereby influencing the neuromusculoskeletal system without resorting to drugs.<p>

<b>KINDER THAN SURGERY AND HEADBANDS</b><p>
The approach of conventional medicine to what they describe as lopsided skulls is rather severe and traumatic to infants, Dr. Holland explains. Since about 1992, American physicians have reported a huge increase in the incidence of infants born with misshapen skulls. At the same time, pediatric surgeons have performed an alarming number of surgeries on infant skulls for a condition they call cranio-synostosis. Here the skull plates have prematurely fused, constricting the brain and forcing it to bulge in places. The skull may also appear flattened in the back. Surgeons quite coldly refer to this operation as a “cranial vault remodel”—the cutting and reshaping of infant skulls. Now some doctors are worried that pediatric surgeons are misdiagnosing this condition and seriously overprescribing the operation. Some talk about an “epidemic of misdiagnosis.<p>
As an alternative, conventional physicians favor a $2000 hard plastic corrective headband to restore the normal shape of the infant’s skull. This crude device works by applying constant hard pressure to the skull similar to the way dental braces squeeze crooked teeth into alignment. “Infants and little children hate this,” observes Dr. Holland. “Cranial osteopathy has a much kinder, less expensive, and more effective approach.<p>

<b>ADJUSTING THE SKULL TO END COLIC</b><p>
Dr. Holland treated an infant named Annie, 6 months old, who had severe colic and had never slept for more than 2 hours at a time. Annie had episodes of persistent crying, spitting up, and signs of abdominal distress; she could turn her head only one way and did not breast-feed well. Technically, Dr. Holland explained, she had condylar compression, referring to the condyles, which are the cartilage attachments whereby the neck joins the base of the skull.<p>
During the infant’s passage down the mother’s birth canal, the head and neck can get compressed and thus distorted in shape. Annie’s preferential turning of her head in only one direction was a result and this produced the colic. “I estimate that about 10-20% of newborns have some degree of asymmetry in neck-turning when they are born.” In his initial session with Annie, Dr. Holland worked on balancing the muscle reflexes on the right side of her neck, which was the site of the compression. <p>
Suddenly, Annie took a deep breath and relaxed as the entire pattern of musculoskeletal movement up and down her back was reset. The whole pattern of distortion and spasming let go.” That night, Annie slept without interruption for 14 hours and she showed none of the signs of colic after that. Dr. Holland treated her twice more to reinforce the adjustment that had ended the colic. As much as one-third of all colic in newborns may have a structural origin, Dr. Holland adds.<p>

<b>MAKING THE EYES SEE STRAIGHT</b><p>
When her mother brought Abby to Dr. Holland, she was a year old and had Duane’s Syndrome. One of her eyes had retracted into its eye socket, making it appear smaller than the other eye. It was primarily a cosmetic problem, affecting her appearance, but not vision, says Dr. Holland. <p>
Doctors had advised Abby’s mother that cosmetic skull surgery might be the only treatment (at a cost of $75,000-150,000), but Dr. Holland believed that osteopathy could produce far better results with no surgery. In fact, Dr. Holland’s video record of the way Abby’s retracted eye became normal again over a 6-month treatment period is highly impressive.<p>
The structural problem with Abby was that the base of her cranium was twisted, probably due to birth, says Dr. Holland. It might even have developed while Abby was still in the womb. The sphenoid bone under Abby’s pituitary gland was bent or distorted. This distortion produced the disfigurement in the eye. It wasn’t that one eye was measurably smaller than the other but, rather, the tension placed on the structures behind the eye’s orbit pulled it in, making it seem smaller.<p>
Dr. Holland used his hands to work on the sides of Abby’s head and the base of her neck. “Sometimes in a situation like this where the skull is twisted, you put one hand across the forehead and the other across the back of the head and apply a gentle twisting mechanical force to untwist it. Of course, you have to know the anatomy inside and out and how to use your hands exactly to make the right changes.<p>
Dr. Holland’s remark underscores a surprising fact about the skull of an infant, and about the entire human body, even that of adults. The skull is not a rigid unmoving entity; rather, it is “viscous, fluid, elastic, bendable,” says Dr. Holland. The cranial osteopath’s skill is to to apply just the right amount of pressure to the precise skull and neck structures to “bend” the distortion back to normal. “I liken this to whispering a request to somebody rather than yelling a command. When you induce a gentle force, the body can accept it and restore the correct balance.” Gentle can mean as light as the weight of a quarter on the skin.<p>
Dr. Holland began seeing positive changes in Abby within the first month of treatment. Each weekly session lasted about 20 minutes; after 3 months, Abby started “looking very good.” In all, it took 6 months to coax her muscles, tissues, and bones to reset themselves and for her retracted eye to come forward in alignment with the other eye.<p>

<b>CALMING SEIZURES WITH THE DOCTOR’S HANDS</b><p>
Osteopaths who work with children are often criticized by conventional M.D.s. They say you cannot change the function of the brain by putting your hands on the outside of the head. But Dr. Holland proved them wrong quite convincingly in his successful treatment of a boy named Andrew, aged 14 months, who had infantile spasms or seizures. Dr. Holland was not at all surprised to discover that a cranial dysfunction was the cause.<p>
Andrew was the firstborn in the family and had arrived with a compressed shoulder which meant that the structural forces on his head were uneven. He had obvious skull distortion, the sutures between the skull plates overrode one another, his head bulged noticeably on one side, and he couldn’t turn his head, and thus nurse, in one direction.<p>
Andrew was suffering 30-40 seizures in quick succession. Doctors at a childrens’ hospital told his mother that Andrew was likely to end up in a chronic vegetative state, his life wasted. Meanwhile, the anticonvulsant the doctors had him on failed to stop the seizures. The first step Dr. Holland took was to encourage the neurologist to prescribe a different anticonvulsant because the constant brain seizures kept erasing the corrections Dr. Holland’s osteopathic manipulations achieved. A new drug reduced Andrew’s spasms by about 60%, enabling Andrew’s musculoskeletal system to begin retaining Dr. Holland’s corrections.<p>
Next, by studying brain-scan printouts of Andrew’s brain energy patterns, Dr. Holland found that the location of his brain seizures matched the site where his skull was distorted. Using osteopathic manipulation techniques, he was able to release the constrictions and distortions in this area, thus freeing Andrew of the seizures. “There was a huge release in Andrew’s musculoskeletal system. I could feel how the structural forces were transferring evenly through his neck, up into his skull and down the back. The seizures completely stopped and never returned.<p>
This pivotal treatment occurred 4 months after Andrew first came to Dr. Holland. It took 3 months to find the right anticonvulsant for Andrew and to reduce his seizures. A month later, the osteopathic treatments completely eliminated them. Andrew was kept on the anticonvulsant for an additional 4 months, as a safety measure. Dr. Holland stopped Andrew’s seizures, although the child would be developmentally delayed as a result of virtually missing 9 months of his life due to recurrent seizures. But then he wouldn’t be spending his life as a helpless “vegetable” as his previous doctors had predicted.<p>

<b>RESTORING THE AUTISTIC CHILD TO LIFE</b><p>
Many cases of autism also may be due to cranial distortions, says Dr. Holland. Of the 30 autistic children he has treated with cranial osteopathy, each had the same patterns of skull distortion. Specifically, this was a compression of the brain’s left hemisphere, a bending of the cranial base to the right side, and a bending downward of another bone, the spheno-basilar symphysis.<p>
Generally, it’s birth trauma that produces this degree of skull disfigurement, says Dr. Holland. This left-hemisphere compression of an autistic child’s skull could account for the poor processing between the two brain hemispheres. The key to success in treating autism that is structurally produced is to catch it as early as possible, ideally within the first days or weeks after birth. “In fact, I dream of the day when all newborns and babies will be checked by qualified palpatory diagnosticians,” says Dr. Holland. “That way I hope society can minimize the number of children suffering from potentially reversible conditions.<p>
Osteopathic research shows that 10-15% of newborns have functional problems that result from trauma, strain, injury, or distortion during birth and which do not self-correct. Of these, an estimated 5% develop persistent dysfunction in their body systems. “These figures are consistent with information about the incidence of chronic illness, learning disabilities, developmental delay, and other functional impairments of the general population,” Dr. Holland notes. What cranial osteopathy offers is the chance to avoid or reverse a great deal of misery in infancy, childhood, and adulthood that results from distortions in the structure and function of muscles and bones. <p>
Osteopathic manipulation is becoming much more accepted as a good treatment strategy for a variety of conditions,” Dr. Holland says. “The importance of the neuromusculoskeletal system in health and disease is beginning to be appreciated in medical training programs.<p>
