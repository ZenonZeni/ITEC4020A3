NO END TO DIVIDED GOVERNMENT

The struggle between President Bill Clinton and the Republic-
controlled Congress over almost all issues will probably not produce
much budgetary reform.  The 1996 presidential and congressional
elections are also not likely to lead to changes in policy direction,
even if the Republican challenger, probably Robert Dole wins the
presidential election.  The most likely result of the elections will
be a slim victory for Clinton and Republican control of both houses.
Protectionist sentiment will increase at the grass roots level, but
it is not likely to be translated into policy.  The economy will
drift while the politicians argue over spending and tax cuts.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  United States

April 19, 1995      A huge car bomb devastated a federal building in
                    Oklahoma City, killing at least 167 people.
                    Timothy Mc Veigh and Terry Nichols were later
                    charged with the bombing.

June 2, 1995        Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady's F-16 was shot
                    down over Bosnia, and he narrowly escaped Serb
                    forces after fleeing his crippled plane.  He was
                    rescued by the Marines six days later.

June 29, 1995       The US Space shuttle Atlantis successfully docked
                    with the Russian station Mir.

November 5, 1995    In national elections, Republicans took control
                    of both houses of Congress for the first time in
                    40 years.

December 1995       A Budget Impasse caused 260,000 federal employees
                    to be temporarily out of work.

December 1995       US troops were sent to Bosnia as part of a NATO
                    mission.
