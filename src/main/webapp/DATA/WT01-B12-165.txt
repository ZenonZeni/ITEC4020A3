<H3>ZURICH KEMPER INVESTMENTS LAUNCHES NEW RETIREMENT PLANS UNIT</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (April 2) -- As part of a strategic plan to further 
strengthen its position as a leading provider of qualified retirement 
plan products and services, Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. 
(formerly Kemper Financial Services, Inc.) has formed a new strategic 
business unit, Kemper Retirement Plans Group.
<P>

"The formation of a separate, stand alone business unit to support and 
service qualified plans underscores our commitment to this increasingly 
important marketplace," said Stephen B. Timbers, president, chief 
executive officer and chief investment officer of Zurich Kemper 
Investments, Inc.
<P>

Separately, the company announced that William E. Chapman II has been 
named president of the Kemper Retirement Plans unit.  Chapman was formerly 
executive vice president of marketing and product management for Kemper.  
He has more than 30 years experience in the retirement plans business.
<P>

"Bill Chapman is a seasoned veteran and an accomplished executive with a 
tremendous wealth of knowledge and expertise in the qualified plans arena," 
said Timbers.  "Under his capable direction, we are confident that our 
retirement plan business will grow significantly and that in a few short 
years Kemper will be recognized as one of the leading providers of 
retirement plan products and services to businesses of all sizes."
<P>

"Our vision is clear: by the year 2000, we expect to be the acknowledged 
leader in the retirement plan business in a much broader sense than we are 
today," said Chapman.  "One of our first priorities is to increase our 
sales capability to support the broker-sold market and at the same time, 
hire salespeople to directly market to larger plan sponsors."
<P>

Chapman cited several other factors that he believes will drive Kemper's 
success in the coming years.  These factors include superior recordkeeping; 
innovative and broad use of technology to service the needs of 
participants, plan sponsors and administrators; and investment products 
that "make sense" to plan participants and address their investment needs 
and expectations.
<P>

With more than 45 years of professional investment management experience, 
Kemper has long been a household name for investment products and services. 
 Kemper is an experienced qualified plan provider who currently serves more 
than 8,000 plans and manages more than $4 billion in retirement plan 
assets.  The company believes it was the first to dispatch a field sales 
force committed exclusively to supporting qualified plan sales, and also 
the first to establish a fully dedicated in-house retirement plan marketing 
staff to market the company's retirement plans.
<P>

Kemper Retirement Plans is a unit of Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI). 
 ZKI is the investment manager for the <A HREF="../../funds/kemperfunds.html">Kemper Funds</A>.  
Kemper Funds consists of 61 open-end portfolios and seven closed-end portfolios.  It has nearly 3 
million shareholder accounts and approximately $45 billion in retail assets.
<P>

<A HREF="../../prospectus.html">Prospectuses</A> for the Kemper Funds are available from the 
principal underwriter, Kemper Distributors, Inc.  They contain more complete information including 
fees and expenses and should be read carefully before investing or sending money.
<P>
	
ZKI is part of Zurich Insurance Group, a global organization headquartered 
in Zurich, Switzerland that provides services in life and non-life 
insurance, reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.
