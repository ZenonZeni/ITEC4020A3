<P>Founded in 1990 on an old English estate, G Force Precision Engineering Ltd. (Sussex) has built a reputation as a premier specialist in international motorsports--Formula One, IndyCar and Super Touring--for its 
design, manufacture, test, and track-side engineering support. Two recent projects the company has been involved with are: (1) the 100,000-hp Thrust SSC, which G Force built for Richard Noble for a land-speed record attempt and (2) the design and build of chassis for the 1997 Indy Racing League (IRL) series.

<P>The G Force founders are veterans of Formula One and Indy racing. They have surrounded themselves with 40-some experts in flat floor race car concepts, composite structures, aerodynamics, wind tunnel model design and test, pattern-making, metallurgy, fabrication and machining.

<P>Shown here is the activity in what once was the stables of an old English estate and is still very much yet a stable--for a different kind of thoroughbred, a very different kind of racing.

Like A Pencil
</H2>
<P>Ken Anderson, lead designer, G Force Precision Engineering, Ltd., one of three firms selected to build the new Indy IRL car, needed to develop the chassis in a big hurry. From a clean sheet to the first race of the season this coming January 25th at the Disney World 200. Which led him to have at least three major considerations:
<UL>
<LI><I>time</I>--which is a fleeting finite element, a factor which cannot be negotiated
<LI><I>tools</I>--specifically those which help make the best use of what little time there is 
<LI><I>results</I>--which like time, cannot be negotiated and must be superlative.<P>
</UL>
<B>Tools</B>. This is the answer to all three concerns.
<P>What Anderson has selected as a design tool is a straightforward, simple 3D wireframe CAD program 
from Ashlar, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA), called Vellum.

<P>Vellum is not a 3D solids package, nor is it a CAE package. Vellum is a PC-based program that Anderson 
admits he uses as a 2D &quot;drafting&quot; program--like a pencil.

<P>He explains: when he wants to draw a line (the entire IRL car, from components, to wheels, to the body 
and chassis, has been done in Vellum), he wants to 
<I>draw</I> it. He does <I>not</I> want to keyboard, like data entry, in points in space what he wants to draw, and then create it with snap keys. He just wants to take the mouse, and draw, and leave the resident 3D capability in the background until--and if--it's needed.

<P>The IRL body, for example, is designed entirely in one-inch 2D sections stacked together, allowing the 
sections, and the spaces between them, to be looked at individually or in total. Then, a simple menu selection renders the body in wireframe, can be downloaded in DXF or IGES for translation for multi-axis machining.

<P><B>Simplicity</B>. Anderson points to an attribute called the &quot;drafting assistant.&quot; Think of it like this: You've drawn a horizontal line a few inches across the screen with the mouse. Now you want to place a vertical line perpendicular to the mid-point of the first. As you drag the line tool along the horizontal line, a screen prompt pops up when you've reached midpoint. The &quot;assistant&quot; then creates the vertical line, assuring that if you drag along its length, your second line will be perpendicular to the first. No data points in space. No keystrokes. Just drag the mouse. Like a pencil on a pad.
