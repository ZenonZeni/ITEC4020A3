<P><HR><H4>
Since the Winter of 1990, an ACTCM student began to develop a medicinal herb 
garden on the school grounds.  Since that time, the Medicinal Herb Garden Project 
Director continues to develop the project.   The garden consists mainly of Chinese 
medicinal plants and some important European and North American herbs are included.  
The garden is intended to serve as an educational tool and to provide a place where
the general public may gain a greater awareness of Chinese medicine.  Students can 
be assisted in learning the usage of each plant, and both students and the general
public alike, can gain a deeper feeling and link with the herbs.  Plaques are placed in
the garden containing information cards providing the Chinese and Latin names of the 
herbs, the "temperature" (hot or cold), the taste (bitter, sweet, bland, etc.), and the 
function in Chinese medicine.  Having close access to the living plants that are being 
used at the school, is a valuable learning tool. Also, harvesting the useful parts of the
plants, drying and tasting them firsthand, can be an enlightening experience that can 
connect one to the botanical in a special and personal way.  The plants have been 
obtained as young plants from nurseries, botanical gardens, private individuals, and 
from seed.  Contacts for the plants and seeds have been made from as far away as 
Europe, Japan, Korea, and China.
<P>
The garden is a work in progress.  New contacts and new plants/seeds are continuously 
being sought out.  There are plans to translate and compile information on the usage of 
many of the species grown here which are not yet listed in the current medical materials 
in English.  Students are encouraged to assist the Medicinal Herb Garden Project Director 
and to be involved in the project
