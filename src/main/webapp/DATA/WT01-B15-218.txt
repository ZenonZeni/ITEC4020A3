Transportation and Emergency Response Training; Technical
Assistance and Funding
<p>
<b>AGENCY:</b> Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management,
Department of Energy.
<p>
<b>ACTION:</b> Notice of inquiry; supplemental information.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="summary">
<b>SUMMARY:</b> The Department of Energy (the Department) intends
to implement a program of technical assistance and funds to
States for training for public safety officials of appropriate
units of local government and Indian tribes through whose
jurisdiction the Secretary of Energy plans to transport spent
nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. The training would
cover both safe routine transportation procedures and emergency
response procedures. The Department issued a Notice of Inquiry in
the Federal Register on January 3, 1995 (60 FR 99) which briefly
describes various options to delineate Section 180(c) of the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act policy and procedures. Members of the
public were invited to submit comments on the Notice of Inquiry.
In the March 14, 1995, Federal Register (60 FR 13715) the
Department extended the deadline for comments to May 18, 1995. In
a continuing effort to include stakeholders in pre-decisional
discussions, the Department has developed additional information,
presented below, that discusses options for policy and procedures
and their applicability to the Section 180(c) mandate. The
discussion below does not reflect final Departmental policy. The
Department welcomes comments in response to this Federal Register
notice on how best to implement the Section 180(c) program.
Comments to the previous notice will also be considered.  The
Department intends to prepare a Notice of Proposed Policy and
Procedures for the Section 180(c) program in 1996.
<p>
<b>DATES:</b> Written comments should be sent to the Department
and must be received on or before September 30, 1995.

<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>
<p>
<b>I. Purpose and Need for Agency Action</b>
<p>
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (42
U.S.C.  10101 et seq.) (NWPA or ``the Act''), the Department of
Energy is responsible for disposal of civilian spent nuclear
fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a deep geologic
repository. The Department is also responsible for managing the
disposal of spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power
plants and high-level nuclear waste, and for possible monitored
retrievable storage of spent nuclear fuel prior to disposal.
Additionally, the Department is responsible for transportation
of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste to the Department's
disposal or storage sites. To carry out these responsibilities,
the Department needs to implement Section 180(c)of the Act.
Section 180(c) of the Act states:
<p><pre>
    The Secretary [of Energy] shall provide technical assistance
    and funds to States for training for public safety officials 

    of appropriate units of local government and Indian tribes   

    through whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to transport  

    spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste under     

    subtitle A or under subtitle C. Training shall cover         

    procedures required for safe routine transportation of these 

    materials, as well as procedures for dealing with emergency  

    response situations. The Waste Fund shall be the source of   

    funds for work carried out under this subsection.[42  U.S.C. 

    10175]

<p></pre>
In the interest of obtaining input from the broadest range of
stakeholders, the Department began to develop the Section 180(c)
program by publishing a Notice of Inquiry in the Federal
Register on January 3, 1995 (60 FR 99). The Notice of Inquiry
briefly described various policy and administrative options the
Department was considering and invited members of the public to
submit comments. In response to comments requesting more
information on these options, the Department is presenting
additional information in this Notice of Inquiry.
<p>
The analysis presented here contains three main sections:
Guiding Principles for Section 180(c) Policy and Procedures,
Options for Section 180(c) Policy and Procedures, and Summary of
Public Comments received in response to the January 3, 1995,
Notice of Inquiry.
<p>
<b>II. Guiding Principles for Section 180(c) Policy and
Procedures</b>
<p>
Section 180(c) requires the Department to provide financial
and technical assistance for training. Within this mandate,
specific training elements must be addressed. Training must
encompass procedures for both emergency response and safe
routine transportation for public safety officials and
appropriate units of local government and Indian tribes through
whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to transport fuel or
high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
While the mechanism for distributing the funding and
technical assistance for training is not specifically provided
for in the Act, the legislative history (S. Rep. No. 152, 100th
Cong., 1987) of this section suggests that Congress intended for
the Department to provide direct funding to States and they,
rather than the Department, would determine how best to allocate
the funds. The Department will retain the responsibility of
ensuring that Section 180(c) funds are distributed consistent
with the NWPA.
<p>
In addition, the Department has identified several guiding 
principles that it intends to follow in carrying out the
requirements  of Section 180(c). The following are not listed in
any particular order.
    <ul>
    <li>The Department recognizes that State, tribal, and
local jurisdictions vary in organizational and staffing
structures, philosophies on roles and responsibilities of public
safety officials, and levels of preparedness and training. The
Department will strive to develop a program with enough
flexibility to accommodate the wide variety of State, tribal,
and local assistance needs associated with NWPA shipments and
Departmental responsibilities under Section 180(c).
    <li>Where possible, the Section 180(c) program should be
 integrated into established Federal, State, and tribal training 
structures.
    <li> The Department's responsibilities under other
statutory authorities must be considered in the Department's
options evaluation.  These Departmental responsibilities exist
under the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP),
coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
Department's 5500 series Orders, and other radiological
emergency preparedness and response programs.
    <li> The Department will strive to minimize the Section
180(c) program's administrative burden on the Department and
recipient jurisdictions.
    <li> Distribution or use of Section 180(c) funds must be
in  accordance with restrictions applicable to the Nuclear Waste
Fund as indicated in the NWPA.
</ul>
<p>
<b>III. Options For Section 180(c) Policy and Procedures</b>
<p>
This section is divided into two parts. The first part
discusses a range of policy options that, when defined, will
largely characterize the scope of the Section 180(c) program.
These policy options are inextricably linked to how the
Department will define the training goals and terms relevant to
Section 180(c). Therefore, the policy options are discussed in
terms of: (1) Emergency response training goals, (2) Safe
routine transportation training goals and definitions,  (3)
Technical assistance definitions, (4) Eligibility criteria, (5) 
Funding allocation formulas, and (6) Restrictions on use of
funds.
<p>
Second part discusses the procedural options through which
Section  180(c) assistance might be administered. These options
include other  Federal training programs that the Department may
be able to use to  meet Section 180(c) requirements and funding
mechanisms that may be used to distribute assistance.
<p>
<i>A. Discussion of Policy Options</i> 
<p>
<i>Emergency Response Training Goals</i>
Jurisdictions have differences in philosophy, in division of 
responsibility, and in levels of resources when planning for
hazardous materials emergency response procedures. Some
jurisdictions want those officials responsible for initial
response action (``first responders'') at the local level to
have the highest levels of training and equipment to prepare for
all events. Conversely, other jurisdictions direct resources to
more specialized response capabilities of regional or State
hazardous materials response teams and provide first-on-scene
personnel and first responders with only awareness training. The
Department will take both these positions into account when
delineating the scope of the Section 180(c) program. 
<p>
<i>Safe Routine Transportation Definitions and Training Goals</i>
<p>
The Federal government and State, tribes and local
governments currently engage in a range of activities related to
safe routine transportation and accompanying training. Part of
setting the scope of Section 180(c) will be identifying what in
the existing range is appropriate for NWPA shipments. Most safe
transportation activities are designated the responsibility of
the shipper and carrier by Federal regulatory action. However,
States and tribes, in varying degrees, perform conveyance
inspections and impose restrictions and penalties as part of
safe transportation and its enforcement. The Federal government 
carries out three types of activities related to safe routine 
transportation. The Department of Transportation sets regulations
for driver qualifications, hours of operation, labeling and
placarding and related activities. They also conduct the Motor
Carrier Safety Assistance Program discussed later in this paper 
that provides funding to encourage States to enforce uniform
motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations. In
addition, the Department of Energy has implemented stringent
driver qualifications and vehicle inspection standards for the
eventual shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near
Carlsbad, New Mexico. State and tribal regulatory authority for
safe transportation inspections or enforcement is much more
limited for rail transportation than for highway transportation.
<p>    
Some potential definitions of safe, routine transportation
have been developed by the Department and stakeholder groups.
The two definitions listed below may not be comprehensive and
additional activities will be considered when defining safe
routine transportation. Through such definitions, training needs
may be better identified and provided for in a Section 180(c)
program.
<p>
Proposed definition from <i>Strategy \1\</i> document: ``Safe,
routine transportation is the condition of incident-free
transportation. It involves the inspection and enforcement of
shipments through State, Tribal, and local jurisdictions. Safe
routine highway transportation is characterized by adequate
vehicle, driver, and package inspection, and enforcement of the
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and the Hazardous
Materials Regulations. Rail and barge transportation regulations
include the Federal Railroad Administration and Coast Guard 
regulations. Compliance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission
requirements for prenotification and physical protection also
contributes to safe, routine transportation.''

Provide Training Assistance to State, Tribal, and Local
Governments, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management,
DOE/RW-0374P, November 1992, Washington, D.C.
<hr>
<p>
Proposed definition from Transportation External
Coordination  Working Group \2\: ``Safe Routine Transportation is
the uneventful movement, from origin to destination, of
hazardous materials in a manner that does not present an undue
risk to human health or the environment and is in compliance
with applicable Federal, State, tribal and local laws and
regulations.'' If this definition is chosen, the word
``hazardous'' will be replaced by the words ``radioactive
waste''. 
<p>
<hr>
    \2\ The Transportation External Coordination Working Group is
a  group of national and regional organizations that participates
in the Department's efforts to identify significant issues
related to the transportation of hazardous and radioactive
materials, recommend activities to resolve those issues, and
implement appropriate activities as Transportation External
Coordination Working Group tasks. All meetings are open to the
public.
<hr>

<p>
<i>Technical Assistance Definitions</i>
<p>
The Department needs to determine what constitutes
``technical  assistance'' as it applies to the Section 180(c)
program. As with safe routine transportation, technical
assistance has been widely discussed in the Transportation
External Coordination Working Group and other forums where the
Department and stakeholders discuss transportation issues. The
following illustrate a range of possible definitions of the term
``technical assistance''.
<p>
Proposed definition from Strategy document: ``Technical
assistance is assistance that the Secretary of Energy can
provide that is unique to the Department to aid training that
will cover procedures for the safe, routine transportation and
emergency response situations during the transport of spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
<p>
If a definition of technical assistance is provided in the 
implementation of Section 117 of the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA), OCRWM will use that
definition for future planning regarding emergency situations.''
<p>
Note: The Department of Transportation (DOT) does not provide
a definition of technical assistance in the HMTUSA regulations.
<p>
Proposed definition from Transportation External Coordination
Working Group: ``The term <i>Technical Assistance</i> as it is
used in Section  180(c) implies that the Department of Energy
will, in general, provide planning guidance, training support,
available definitions of technical  standards and criteria,
practical support, and expertise to ensure that  State and tribal
governments are trained for safe routine  transportation
practices as well as capable of responding to spent  nuclear fuel
and high-level waste transportation emergencies within  their
jurisdictions. More specifically, activities may include aid in 
developing, implementing, and evaluating readiness and response
plans;  assistance in developing, conducting and evaluating
exercises and  training programs, support for coordination
between neighboring groups, coordination between other government
agency programs, and for public information and education
efforts; on-site response support in the event of an accident or
incident; and logistical and scientific expertise for recovery,
reentry, and remediation activities at an emergency site.
Technical assistance may include activities that monitor and
assess the capabilities of groups in order to make funding
decisions. Financial assistance or direct funding, however, is
considered to be beyond the scope of this definition.''
<p>
Proposed definition from the Council of State Governments 
Midwestern Office: ``The term <i>Technical Assistance</i> as it
is used in  Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act means
a variety of  activities designed to ensure that state, tribal,
and local governments are trained for safe routine transportation
practices as well as responding to transportation emergencies
within their jurisdictions, including but not limited to planning
guidance, training support, practical support, funding of
pre-identified equipment, and expertise.'' 
<p>
<i>Eligibility Criteria</i>
<p>
While the NWPA clearly directs the Department to provide
technical assistance and funds to States for training for public
safety officials of appropriate units of local government and
Indian tribes through whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to
transport spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste, a
key determination is the eligibility of jurisdictions in light
of the shipment schedule throughout the life of the shipment
program.
<p>
The Department has stated previously that implementation of
the Section 180(c) program will begin three to five years prior
to shipments. Although the Department has not yet selected
routes or final disposal or interim storage sites, current
contracts with utilities identify a sequence of acceptance from
utility sites. Eligibility may be tied to transportation
activity within a jurisdiction.  Alternatively, all jurisdictions
could receive assistance in the first year and throughout a
Section 180(c) program. The Department must consider how
eligibility may be tied to transportation activity both before
shipments begin and in those cases of years where there is no 
transportation activity planned through a particular
jurisdiction.
<p>
<i>Funding Allocation Formulas</i>
<p>
A funding allocation formula is another element of the
Section  180(c) program whose definition might assist in
establishing the scope of the program. A funding allocation
formula is often the primary tool in a grants program identifying
the variables that affect the amount of funding to go to a 
particular recipient. A formula may identify a percentage of a
pool that has been appropriated for an entire program or identify

qualification for predetermined amounts. The formula may identify
a single amount for each recipient or a series of smaller amounts
for the recipient to use toward specified goals.
<p>
For the implementation of Section 180(c), funding allocation
may be  based on a variety of factors. Some of these factors
include the following:
<p>
<b>Shipment miles.</b> This is an estimation of miles that a
shipment would cover through a jurisdiction combined with the
frequency of shipments. A slightly different approach would
include route miles.  This estimation is a measure of the length
of a route through a jurisdiction but does not include frequency
of shipments. The two measurements produce different results.
Using shipment miles would imply that two jurisdictions with
routes of equal length would receive different funding levels if
one jurisdiction experienced a higher number of shipments
compared to the other.
<p>
<b>Number of affected jurisdictions.</b> Because training is
targeted for people rather than mileage, the identification of
the number of groups at the State, local, or tribal level that
should receive assistance may be an effective way to determine
funding. Using this measure, allocation could effectively mirror
highly populated metropolitan areas and less populated rural
areas. However, the number of affected jurisdictions may prove
too difficult to defend, particularly when considering the
differing training goals of dissimilar areas. As an example,
areas of higher population may have more emergency response 
personnel to train, but in general they may already be better
trained  and have considerably smaller response areas. Rural
emergency response jurisdictions may cover considerably wider
areas with a much smaller response group.
<p>    
<b>Population</b> may be a factor in funding allocation as it
indicates the number of people along a route of a particular
shipment. However, this implies areas of lower population would
receive lower levels of assistance and those with higher
populations would receive more.  Including a measure of
population in an allocation formula may be more effective if used
in conjunction with other measures.
<p>
<b>Agreements between neighboring jurisdictions.</b> In some
cases, a  State or tribe not receiving funding in a given year
may still share some responsibility with neighboring States or
tribes that do receive funding. An allocation may include a
provision for additional cooperative activities in these cases.
However, it is also conceivable that States and tribes would be
asked to rely on their existing cooperative agreements.
<p>
<b>Annual timing of funding.</b> The Department has stated that 
implementation should begin three to five years prior to
shipments but some recipients may want to apply the bulk of
assistance closer to a potential shipment date to ensure the
highest possible training retention. Assistance may be provided
at the start of the program to all recipients or it may be
linked to transportation activity in a recipient's jurisdiction.
A combination of these two possibilities may provide basic
assistance for all recipients at the program's start and 
additional, more specific assistance based on transportation
activity within the jurisdictions.
<p>    
<b>Designation of a proportion of the assistance</b> for training
in  specific areas. For example, funding could be divided by the
formula  for training in each mode of transportation, i.e., rail
or highway.  Likewise, it could be divided into assistance for
routine  transportation training and assistance for emergency
response training.  The Department may also choose to leave
decisions to recipients on the  specific areas of funding.
<p>
<i>Restrictions on Use of Funds</i>
<p>
A Section 180(c) program may include some restrictions on the
use of funds to ensure that the Department's intentions for
direction and administration of the program are met. Any
restrictions will also  impact the program's scope. 
<p>
Funding restrictions may affect the choice of training courses,
division of funds for local governments, or coordination
activities.  Training costs may be limited to tuition for
Department-approved  courses, or recipients may be able to
develop or choose their own  training programs with their funding
allocation. The Department might  simply suggest a course list to
recipients. The Department may limit  the percentage of an
allocation to be spent on administrative  activities or specify a
percentage that must reach a local or regional level. Some
specification for sharing funds with neighboring jurisdictions
may be included, particularly where Memoranda of Understanding
(MOU) or mutual aid agreements exist between jurisdictions for
emergency response activities.
<p>
Some direction may be included governing the use of funds to 
purchase equipment. While the Act states that financial
assistance is for training, some have argued that training is
only valuable in conjunction with equipment that will be used.
The Department may develop a list of approved equipment for use,
develop a list of approved equipment for training, or restrict
equipment purchase to a percentage of discretionary funding.
Similar choices may be made regarding travel costs for training
of individuals and travel and salary costs for trainers.
<p>
Restrictions may be identified that address the timing of
funding use. For example, recipients may be required to use
allocated funds within each year, within some specified time, or
within the life of the program. An alternate option is to
annually reimburse approved expenses by each recipient.

<i>B. Discussion of Procedural Options</i>
<p>
The following section discusses the Department's current
research on procedural options for a Section 180(c) program and
the existing Federal programs that could be used as funding
mechanisms or to provide technical assistance. Also, the section
discusses ways to combine elements of existing options to create
new programs for funding and training. An analysis of each
procedural option is included in terms of the intent of the NWPA
and the stated goals of the Section 180(c) program. The options
can be considered either as avenues through which to administer
Section 180(c) or as models that the Department could emulate.
<p>
The existing Federal training programs are discussed in terms
of their safe routine transportation and emergency preparedness 
activities, and ways in which they are administered. Options
discussed include: (1) the Department of Transportation's
Hazardous Materials  Transportation Act grants, (2) the
Department of Transportation's Motor Carrier Safety Assistance
Program, (3) the Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad
Administration's State Participation Program, (4) current DOE
training programs, (5) the Federal Emergency  Management Agency's
Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement program, (6)  cooperative
agreements and grants, (7) Department-wide or OCRWM  assistance
programs, and (8) combinations of options from previous  groups.
<p>
1. <i>Department of Transportation, Research and Special
Programs</i> 
Administration, Interagency Hazardous Materials; Public Sector
Training and Planning Grants     
<p>
This program of Federal grants is primarily considered in this 
document for its applicability to emergency response training for
highway shipments.
<p>
DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) has
developed a program for reimbursable training and planning
grants (49 CFR Part 110). The program was established by the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), as amended by the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990.
It is intended to enhance existing State, tribal, and local
hazardous materials transportation emergency preparedness and
response programs by providing financial and technical
assistance, national direction, and guidance that enhances 
overall implementation of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). The program scope is broader
than that of Section 180(c), covering all hazardous materials,
not just radioactive materials. The program is supported by fees
collected from a registration program for shippers and carriers
of certain hazardous materials.
<p>  
RSPA has issued a list of activities eligible for funding
under this program. States and tribes must complete application
packages which require specific information on the intended use
of a proposed grant. Applications are reviewed semi-annually and
approved or declined by an RSPA grants administrator.
<p>    
Applications include detailed descriptions of proposed
programs of planning or training. For training grants, the
application includes a letter from the governor of the State or
from the tribal government with authorization for a particular
State agency or tribal organization to receive or administer the
grant; a statement explaining current practices for collecting
fees on the transportation of hazardous materials and whether
such fees are used to support hazardous materials 
transportation; a statement outlining individuals who will be 
responsible for coordinating and administering the program; a
detailed narrative of goals and objectives; a statement of work,
associated  costs, and schedule; and a description of major
costs.
<p>
For planning grants, the application includes a certification
for compliance with EPCRA; a statement of aggregate expenditures
for the previous two fiscal years; an agreement to make 75% of
the grant available to Local Emergency Preparedness Committees
(LEPC) or their designees; other specifics on who will
administer the grant and how;  and a statement that the State
Emergency Response Commission has reviewed the grants
application.
<p>
The recipient agency is required to provide 20% of direct and
indirect costs, acceptable in funds or in labor and equipment 
equivalents. Although limited needs-based advances are allowable
in some cases, in general the grants are reimbursed. An existing
grant is not a commitment of future Federal funding. Training
and/or planning grants have been awarded to 50 States, 5
territories, and 11 Indian  tribes. Indian tribes had been
restricted to only receiving planning  grants, but as of 1995
will also be eligible for training grants.
<p>
As directed within the HMTA, allocation criteria for both
training and planning grants are based on the needs of
applicants. A portion of the grants is set aside for separate
distribution to tribes. Allocation factors include objective
criteria and criteria based on performance, compliance, and
innovation. Some factors considered in allocating funds include:
number of hazardous materials facilities, types and amounts of 
hazardous materials transported, population at risk, frequency
and number of incidents reported in past years, high mileage
transportation corridors, whether fees are collected on
transportation of hazardous materials, and whether such fees are
used to carry out purposes related to this activity. This places
the burden on RSPA to identify the most needy applicants in the
application review process and reflect their assessment in each
award.
<p>
Assistance under Section 180(c) is not needs-based but
provided to each jurisdiction along NWPA transportation routes.
The Department will identify a program-specific basis for
Section 180(c) funding allocation.
<p>
<i>2. DOT, Federal Highway Administration, Office of Motor
Carriers, Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program</i>
<p>
The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) is
primarily considered in this document for its applicability to
training for safe routine transportation procedures for highway
shipments. 
<p>
DOT provides Federal funds to the States for a variety of 
commercial motor vehicle activities that encourage each State to 
enforce uniform motor carrier safety and hazardous materials 
regulations through MCSAP. The program was established in the
Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 and reauthorized
in the Motor Carrier Act of 1991 (Title IV of the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991). Present funding
levels exceed $80 million.
<p>
The objective of MCSAP is to reduce the number and severity
of accidents and hazardous materials incidents involving
commercial motor vehicle carriers by substantially increasing
the level and effectiveness of enforcement activity and the
likelihood that problems affecting, or potentially affecting,
safe vehicle operations will be detected and corrected. More
specifically, States use MCSAP funds to train personnel to
inspect vehicles and driver records, conduct reviews of carrier
operations, and promote public awareness of commercial vehicle
laws and safety. Also, States may use funds to support truck 
weight enforcement, drug interdiction activities, uniform truck
and bus accident reporting, Commercial Drivers License
enforcement, hazardous materials requirements training, research
and development, public education, and enforcement of State
traffic laws in conjunction with MCSAP roadside inspections.
<p>
Uniformity and compatibility of State regulatory requirements
affecting interstate and intrastate carriers is a primary goal
of the MCSAP. As a prerequisite for MCSAP funding, the Federal
Highway Administration requires that States adopt or agree to
adopt interstate and intrastate regulations which are compatible
with Federal safety regulations. Currently, 48 States and 4
Territories actively participate in MCSAP but not Indian tribes.
<p>
To receive basic MCSAP funding, a State must first agree to
adopt and assume responsibility for enforcing the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR parts 390-399) and highway
related portions of the Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations
(49 CFR parts 107, 171- 173, 177, 178 and 180) or compatible
State regulations. Each State must also submit annually a State
Enforcement Plan for the conduct of an effective safety program.
The Federal Highway Administration uses this plan as a basis for
monitoring and evaluating performance of the State.
<p>
The Federal Highway Administration, through regulations in 40
CFR  350, lists other specifics for basic grant approval and
identifies in more detail the contents of the State Enforcement
Plan including requirements of State participation in North
American Uniform Driver/ Vehicle Inspection standards and other
Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance programs. (The  Commercial
Vehicle Safety Alliance is a national organization that has 
developed uniform inspection procedures, and trains inspectors in
these procedures.)
<p>
Available MCSAP funds are distributed in three separate
grants:  Basic, Supplemental, and Special. Basic grants are given
to each State  with an approved State Enforcement Plan according
to an allocation formula based on the most recent reliable data
concerning the following factors in equal proportion: road
mileage, vehicle miles traveled, number of commercial vehicles
over 10,000 pounds, population, and special fuel consumption.
Supplemental grants are used to encourage innovative, successful,
cost efficient or cost effective programs and may include
emphasis areas identified through consultation between
the Federal Highway Administration and States. To be eligible
for a supplemental grant, a State must qualify for a basic
grant. Special grants are awarded for activities that help
States meet the requirements of eligibility for basic grants; or
for States already participating in the basic program, to
develop the prerequisites for expanded activities not presently
part of their basic programs. Special grants are also available
for research or data collection activities.  To be eligible for a
special grant, a State need not qualify for a basic grant.
<p>
MCSAP reimburses States for 80% of eligible costs identified
in the State's State Enforcement Plan. The other 20% must be
provided by the State. Eligible costs are defined in 49 CFR
350.29 but include salaries and benefits of inspection and
enforcement personnel, recruitment costs, training, equipment,
vehicles, uniforms, motor fuel and oil, communications
equipment, travel costs and per diem, and special inspection
equipment, among others. 
<p>
<i>3. DOT, Federal Railroad Administration, State Participation
Program</i>
<p>    
The Department has studied this program as a possible avenue to 
provide training for safe routine transportation procedures for
rail transportation.
<p>
Initial responsibility for the inspection of hazardous
material shipments by rail, which travel on private property,
historically has been placed with the railroads. Government
oversight of these type of inspections has been shared by both
the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Railroad
Administration. To date, States and tribes have played a limited
role in these inspections and no monetary Federal assistance is
currently provided in regard to the performance of the 
inspections. Following passage of HMTUSA, the Federal Railroad 
Administration promulgated regulations on State participation in 
railroad safety inspections and investigations concerning 
transportation of hazardous materials.

<p>
The State Participation Program (49 CFR Part 212) for
inspector training began in 1992. State participation is
voluntary. The Federal Railroad Administration pays for each
State participant's travel expenses, per diem allowance, and
course tuition associated with any conferences, seminars,
workshops or classroom training. The State is then required to
provide salary and benefits for the trained inspector who is
expected to spend fifty percent of his/her time conducting 
Federal Railroad Administration-related inspections. Federal
Railroad Administration training does not include provision of
gear or equipment.
<p>
The Federal Railroad Administration trains inspectors in five
disciplines: track, motive power and equipment, operating
practices, signal and train control, and hazardous materials. In
1995 there are 283 Federal Inspectors and 60 safety discipline
specialists spread across the eight standard Federal regions.
Currently, 30 States participate in the program with 134 State
inspectors encompassing all five safety disciplines.
<p>
The number of both Federal and State inspectors who receive 
training in any given fiscal year is dependent upon two factors.
These factors are the training budget allocated to the Federal
Railroad Administration as an agency and the reallocation of the
training funds within the Federal Railroad Administration which
determines the training offered and the number of inspectors,
both State and Federal, who will attend the training. If the
cost of training all the perspective Federal and State
inspectors in a single fiscal year would place a drain on the
training budget, then the participation in training is limited.
<p>
Prior to applying for the Federal Railroad Administration
inspector training program, a State employee must meet the
minimum apprentice level requirements as stated in 49 CFR Part
212. The Federal Railroad Administration will work with the
apprentice applicant to gain the necessary field experience in
order to become certified as a Federal Railroad Administration
inspector under the auspices of the State Participation Program.
<p>
<i>4. Current DOE Training Programs</i>
<p>
Current Department training programs are considered in this 
document as possible sources of training for all aspects required
of a  Section 180(c) program, regardless of chosen funding
mechanisms. 
<p>
The Department of Energy has an extensive infrastructure with
which  to train personnel for safe transportation of radioactive
materials,  compliance with Federal regulations, and preparedness
and response to radiological materials accidents at fixed
facilities and during shipment. The following discussion
describes the current divisions of responsibility within the
Department for transportation and emergency response policy,
current training programs for transportation-related activities,
and the applicability of these to a Section 180(c) program.  This
is not a comprehensive description of the Department's programs 
but rather an outline of those training programs with potential 
relevance to a Section 180(c) program.
<p>
The Department maintains a radiological accident response 
capability for the Federal government. The Department's Assistant
Secretary for Defense Programs manages the Radiological
Assistance Program and ensures that the necessary emergency
plans, procedures, and resources are developed and maintained.
Qualified Radiological Assistance Program teams are located in
ten regions of the United States ready to respond when summoned
by any other Federal agency, State, tribe, local government
official, private industry representative, or private citizen.
The Department's Office of Nonproliferation and National
Security is responsible for coordinating the development and
operation of the overall Departmental Emergency Management
System, including maintenance of an Emergency Operations Center.
The Department also provides this capability in support of the 
Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, which outlines the
roles and responsibilities of all Federal agencies in situations
involving radioactive materials.
<p>
Within the Office of Environmental Management, the Office of 
Transportation, Emergency Management, and Analytical Services is 
responsible for setting Departmental policy on transportation
matters.  As part of this responsibility, the Office of Emergency
Management (EM- 26) Emergency Management Team administers the
Transportation Emergency  Preparedness Program, to coordinate all
non-weapons transportation emergency preparedness across the DOE
complex. The Transportation Emergency Preparedness  Program was
established in 1991 to coordinate the development and 
maintenance of uniform policies and approaches for Department
programs  and field offices responsible for transportation
emergency preparedness activities.
<p>
The Department is also involved in activities at national 
laboratories and regional operations offices around the country
that  require employees and contractors to be trained in proper
handling/ treatment of radioactive materials in routine and
emergency situations.  Transportation operations personnel must
be trained to meet the same Department of Transportation,
Environmental Protection Agency, and Nuclear Regulatory
Commission regulations required of all shippers of hazardous
materials. Because of the variety and magnitude of such 
activities, the Department has developed a number of training
courses that deal with radioactive materials. Many are offered
to State,  tribal, and local public safety officials as well as
Department and contractor personnel.
<p>
Section 180(c) program development could use existing
Departmental courses in several ways. Whether funding were
received through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, DOT,
the Department, or some combination, the training programs could
be modified to accept State and tribal members and train for
NWPA shipments. The courses may be required, approved, or simply
suggested by Section 180(c) policy.  Department training may
provide the added benefit of consistent, accurate training. The
Department offices that share responsibilities for the
Department's transportation and preparedness policies and 
infrastructure, Defense Programs, National Security and Non-
Proliferation, and Environmental Management Offices, will be
consulted  as the Section 180(c) program is developed. Any
training that is  provided under Section 180(c) will be most
effective when it enables  civil safety officials understand and
work better within the existing Departmental and Federal
systems.
<p>
<i>5. Federal Emergency Management Agency, Comprehensive
Cooperative Agreements</i>
<p>
The Department has studied this program as a possible avenue
to channel financial and technical assistance for all aspects of
the Section 180(c) mandate.
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been charged with
building and supporting the nation's emergency management
system. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is responsible
for coordinating emergency planning, preparedness, mitigation,
and assistance functions for the Federal government. As part of
that mission, the Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement mechanism
channels financial and technical assistance to State, tribal and
local governments. The Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement
program (Public Law 95-224, Federal Grant and Cooperative
Agreement Act of 1977) is a possible mechanism through which
Section 180(c) assistance could be administered.
<p>
Each Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement program (the Federal
Emergency Management Agency currently administers about fifteen 
different Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement programs) can be
tailored to meet specific needs of the recipients and the
requirements of the authorizing legislation. Other agencies,
including the Department of Defense and the Environmental
Protection Agency, have used Comprehensive Cooperative
Agreements to deliver funding and technical assistance to meet
the needs of their programs and their statutory obligations.
<p>    
There is considerable flexibility in the Comprehensive
Cooperative Agreement and Cooperative Agreement programs that
would help cover several of the statutory mandates of Section
180(c). The money could be sent to a designated State or tribal
emergency response agency and then passed through to the agency
responsible for safe transport activities. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency already has the means to earmark funds as
Nuclear Waste Fund money, making it easier to monitor proper use
and effectiveness of the program. Lastly, the Comprehensive 
Cooperative Agreement program allows each statement of work to be

different to suit recipients' unique needs within the program's 
parameters.
<p>
Whether the Department uses the Comprehensive Cooperative
Agreement process as a funding mechanism, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's lead agency responsibility for coordinating
Federal emergency management makes it a candidate source for
technical assistance under Section 180(c). The Federal Emergency
Management Agency has lead agency responsibility for monitoring
hazardous materials planning and training under the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of  1992, for the
Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee,  and
for the Radiological Assistance Committees.
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency submitted a proposal
to the Department for administration of the Section 180(c)
program. Their proposal is referred to in the Summary of Public
Comments in this notice and will be considered along with other
comments received in response to the January 1995 notice.
<p>
<i>6. Cooperative Agreements and Grants</i>
<p>
Two basic mechanisms are used by Federal agencies to
distribute funds to State and tribal governments: cooperative
agreements and grants. The Federal Grant and Cooperative
Agreement Act (P.L. 95-224) outlines the proper use of each type
of mechanism. Grants primarily indicate a transfer of funds,
while cooperative agreements imply more substantial involvement
between parties. Grant mechanisms can be further subdivided into
categorical grants, block grants, and direct payments for a
specified use. A Section 180(c) program may make use of any of
these mechanisms.
<p>
Cooperative agreements reflect a more interactive
relationship between the Federal government and a State or local
government or other recipient. As with grants the principal
purpose of the cooperative agreement relationship is the
transfer of money, property, or services to the State or local
government or other recipient to accomplish a public purpose of
support authorized by Federal statute. But unlike grants,
substantial involvement is anticipated between the Federal 
agency and the State or local government or other recipient
during the planned activity.
<p>
Although grants usually present less of an administrative
burden than cooperative agreements, Section 180(c) policy may
require increased interaction between some recipients and the
Department.  Cooperative agreements generally require more
communication between the Department and the recipient
jurisdiction to develop scope of work, monitor activities, and
complete reporting requirements. Grants can be narrowly focused
in purpose and well defined so that once an application has been
approved the Department's role is limited with the recipient
jurisdiction having more flexibility and fewer record keeping 
and monitoring requirements.
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management currently
has cooperative agreements with ten regional and national
organizations. A cooperative agreement mechanism could be
utilized to administer Section 180(c) funds to State and tribal
recipients. While it might add a layer of bureaucracy and
increase administrative costs, it may reduce the long range
costs to the Department. 
<p>
The Department could use a combination of grants and
cooperative agreements based on the recipient jurisdiction's
level of preparedness.  In general, cooperative agreements could
be established with recipients who lacked basic public safety
infrastructure, while a grant program could be established for
recipients with more developed infrastructures. This approach
could help address the lack of working infrastructure for safe
routine transportation and emergency response in some
jurisdictions and the fact that many existing Federal programs 
do not currently fund tribes as they do States.
<p>
The combination of cooperative agreements and grants would
allow for increased involvement between the Department and the
recipient jurisdiction when necessary while not requiring it of
all participants.  Once a basic level of preparedness had been
reached, a jurisdiction could transfer to the grant program.
With this option the Department could define a basic level of
preparedness and identify applicants accordingly, or allow each
applicant to determine the type of funding mechanism most
appropriate to them.
<p>
<i>7. Department-Wide Assistance Program or OCRWM Assistance
Program</i>
<p>
The options discussed above can be considered either as
avenues through which to administer Section 180(c) or as models
that the Department could emulate. If none of the options are
seen as sufficient to meet the statutory requirements of Section
180(c), it is possible that the Department could develop an
assistance program to consolidate all activities of similar
nature. In a more directed approach, OCRWM could create its own
assistance program tailored for Section 180(c).
<p>
Under a Department-wide program, OCRWM would participate with
other Departmental offices in establishing a program to
coordinate provision of financial and technical assistance
across all Department of Energy programs. The assistance could
be designed to address training needs for both emergency
response and safe routine transportation of radioactive
materials for States and Indian tribes for the whole range of
DOE nuclear shipments. These shipments include NWPA shipments, 
transuranic waste shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, 
defense, and other Departmental shipments.
<p>
This approach presents a comprehensive program covering both
safe routine transportation and emergency response for both
States and tribes. It would promote coordination, increase
efficiency, consistency and uniformity throughout the
Department; and allow for a high degree of Departmental control
and oversight. One potential difficulty with this approach would
be that different Departmental offices responsible for shipping
work under different legal requirements that may not be 
compatible. A Departmental assistance program would also require
a commitment of resources to consolidate the functional programs
that have traditionally operated relatively independently. A
Departmental program may also adversely impact the current
schedule for developing the Section 180(c) program.
<p>
OCRWM could develop and implement its own program,
specifically tailored to Section 180(c) requirements. The
benefits of this approach are that OCRWM could develop a program
focusing solely on NWPA requirements. This offers greater
flexibility in designing funding mechanisms and funding
formulas. The disadvantages include duplication of State and
tribal training within the Department and overlap efforts of
other Federal agencies.
<p>
<i>8. Combination of Elements from the Previous Groups</i>
<p>
In order to encompass safe routine transportation and
emergency response training, for rail transportation and highway
transportation, and for State and tribal recipients, a
combination of procedural options may be most effective. There
are many ways to combine the options to meet the Section 180(c)
requirements.
<p>
Some options discussed above have the potential to meet all
of a Section 180(c) program's mandates while others have the
potential to cover only a portion. If the Federal Railroad
Administration and the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program
are used to implement Section  180(c) safe routine transportation
training, then a further combination of options will be
necessary. Emergency response training procedures and tribal
government participation requirements would be met through other
avenues.
<p>
Current Department programs, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's Comprehensive Cooperative Agreements, a Department-wide
program, or an OCRWM-wide program offer the best choices for 
implementing a complete Section 180(c) program through a single
option, but even here combinations are possible. If funding and
technical assistance are distributed through the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, current Departmental training
programs could supply the necessary training courses.
<p>
Other combinations are certainly possible and may include
options not discussed in this paper, such as using funds to
obtain training from private sources and from carriers of
hazardous materials.
<p>
<a name="comments">
<b>IV. Summary of Public Comments</b>
<p> 
The Department received 36 comments in response to the
January 3, 1995, Notice of Inquiry. Comments were received from
several State agencies, an Indian tribal government, a tribal
organization, county governments, national transportation safety
organizations, national and regional state government
organizations, one Federal agency, a nuclear energy business
organization, a utility and two citizens. The commenters held
very diverse opinions; no single theme for implementing Section
180(c) was apparent.
<p>
The following section discusses general categories and
summarizes  major points of comments and the Department's
response, where appropriate. The Department will provide
more-detailed responses to these comments and any additional
comments resulting from this Notice of Inquiry; Supplemental
Information when the Notice of Proposed Policy and Procedures is
issued in early 1996.
<p>
<i>Major Issues</i>
<p>
A. Section 180(c) Policy
<p>
The commenters raised many topics related to defining final
Section 180(c) policy. Although the Department recognizes that
these topics are closely related and overlap each other, this
section divides those topics into the following subsections:
general themes for a Section 180(c) program, safe routine
transportation, emergency response procedures, technical
assistance and equipment, and funding eligibility, allocation
and restrictions.
<p>
<i>General Themes</i>
<p>
A number of commenters offered ideas about the philosophy and
general structure of the program. These ranged from developing a
needs-based type of program to one that offers assistance for an
additional incremental level of training in existing hazardous
materials transportation training.
<p>    
Several commenters requested a program that assesses the
current capabilities of jurisdictions, assesses the needed level
of readiness for NWPA shipments, and then provides Section
180(c) assistance to make up the difference. They suggested that
planning grants could fund jurisdictions to complete the
capabilities assessment. Then, implementation grants could be
provided to carry out the identified activities.
<p>
Another general theme urged the Department to take into
account the low level of risk presented by spent nuclear fuel
and high-level radioactive waste shipments and proportion the
assistance and training accordingly. They maintained that
current hazardous materials transportation training for safe
routine and emergency response procedures is sufficient to
handle any situation that may occur.  Creating a Section 180(c)
program that went beyond the current hazardous materials
transportation training would send a message that the NWPA
shipments are more hazardous than they really are.
<p>
Separate from the issue over the basis for distributing
assistance, several commenters recommended using the State
Emergency Planning Committees and the Local Emergency Planning
Committees as points of contact to decide who should receive
assistance and to determine the needed level of training.
<p>
Other frequently occurring comments urged the Department not
to ship or to limit the number of shipments until a Section
180(c) program is in place. This comment was often made in
conjunction with the comment that the Department has an
obligation to accept waste in 1998, and if Congress identifies a
storage facility, shipping may well begin in 1998 or shortly
thereafter. In addition, these commenters urged the Department
to accelerate Section 180(c) implementation and to ask for a 
Section 180(c) budget allocation in the 1996 budget request to 
Congress.
<p>
Several commenters encouraged the Department to quickly
announce potential routes. They argued that jurisdictions need
to know as soon as possible what routes will be used so that
they may begin planning immediately for shipments and be
prepared if shipping occurs prior to the year 2010 currently
targeted by the Department.
<p>
<i>Safe Routine Transportation</i>
<p>
Several definitions of safe routine transportation were
offered.  These often included activities commenters thought
should be included in training for safe routine transportation.
One commenter endorsed the Transportation External Coordination
Working Group definition while two commenters wrote more
expansive definitions to include combinations of: alternate
route analysis, inspection and enforcement training, en route 
contingency plans, transportation infrastructure improvements,
shipment notification and tracking, escorts, public information,
and development and distribution of training curricula and
course materials.
<p>
Not all comments referred to safe routine transportation
directly, but identified the need for escorts and a satellite
tracking system.  The Conference of Radiation Control Program
Directors questioned the need for escorts as an expensive option
considering the actual level of risk compared to other hazardous
material shipments. The National Conference of State
Legislatures called for the Department to examine the
possibility of response teams travelling with the shipments. The 
tracking system was encouraged as a way to build trust in the
safety of the shipments and work more closely with the corridor
jurisdictions.
<p>
<i>Emergency Response Procedures</i>
<p>
Several commenters offered either definitions of emergency
response procedures or offered activities that they thought
should be covered by training for emergency response procedures.
Frequently, the Department was asked to delineate the
responsibilities of each response level in case of a spent
nuclear fuel transportation incident or accident. Only then
would the best funding mechanism be identified.
<p>
It was frequently commented that emergency response training
for local public safety officials should be integrated into
existing hazardous materials training. A couple of comments
pointed out that current hazardous materials training was
sufficient for local responders because the response
requirements for radiological incidents fall within the
requirements for other hazardous materials shipments.
<p>
Contradictory comments were received concerning training for 
hospital personnel. One commenter argued that training for
hospital personnel was not necessary, while others comments
ranged from the need to provide simple awareness training to
specialized decontamination equipment and training.
<p>
<i>Eligibility Criteria</i>
<p>
Comments on eligibility criteria focused on which
jurisdictional level should be eligible to apply for funds. Some
argued that local governments should be eligible to receive
funds directly. They argued that this would reduce
administrative costs and give local governments more control
over the assistance. Several counties simply requested that they
be guaranteed an amount of funding and given some discretion in
using the assistance. Other commenters said only States and
tribal agencies are eligible to apply for assistance.
 <p>   
Some commenters made suggestions regarding how the timing of
NWPA shipments through a jurisdiction impacts eligibility. The
Western Interstate Energy Board defined an eligible state or
tribe as host and corridor states or tribes through which
shipments under the NWPA are planned within six years. Others
said training should begin one to three years prior to shipment.
<p>
The point was also raised that tribes near corridor
jurisdictions should be eligible for assistance, since their
lands and people would be at risk in case of a transportation
accident or incident. 
<p>
<i>Funding Allocation Formula</i>
<p>
Once eligibility criteria are determined, the total
assistance available will have to be allocated among the
eligible parties.  Commenters were fairly specific in their views
of how funds should be allocated. A frequent comment was that
funds should be allocated according to the shipment miles
through a jurisdiction. The Western Interstate Energy Board
commented that annual implementation grants should have 75% of
the funds allocated according to shipment miles and 25%
allocated to ensure minimum funding levels and program 
capabilities. They defined shipment miles as the product of the 
expected number of shipments multiplied by the distance of such 
shipments. The Nuclear Energy Institute countered that the number
of  shipment miles through a jurisdiction does not automatically
make a jurisdiction more impacted and therefore does not qualify
them for additional assistance. They requested that the
Department allocate funding to incrementally increase
preparedness above what exists, rather than build a new
radiological response capability.
<p>
The Southern States Energy Board suggested that funding
should be allocated to each eligible jurisdiction based on a
formula that includes both the number of routes miles in the
jurisdiction and the population at risk along the shipment
route(s), with consideration given to existing capabilities.
<p>
The HMTA Training and Planning Grants approach (discussed on
pages 8 and 9 of this notice) to allocating funds was also
suggested as a model.
<p>
<i>Allowable Use of Funds</i>
<p> 
The Notice asked stakeholders what types of activities should
be allowed once funding has been allocated. This discussion
often overlaps with the discussion of program scope and the  
definition of key terms. Several State agencies and organizations
said that States and tribes should be the ones to prioritize
needs and decide who needs training. They argued that recipients
need wide latitude in deciding how to spend funds because of the
varying levels of preparedness, divisions of responsibility, and
other differences among jurisdictions. Many commenters, however,
said that the final allocation of funding should guarantee a
specific portion of the funding for local governments to use as
they see best.
<p>
Another comment argued that the DOT Research and Special
Programs Administration grants program provides a good model for
allowable activities. These regulations require recipient
jurisdictions to describe existing programs and explain how the
requested funds supply necessary improvements to the existing
capabilities. They also provide for monitoring of the program's
effectiveness.
<p>
Another frequently mentioned point was that the Section
180(c) program should not require any matching funds from the
jurisdiction in order to receive assistance.
<p>
The final Section 180(c) program will indicate what, if any, 
restrictions there will be on the use of funds. Most likely, the
types of activities that the Department will consider in this
area include:  what, if any, equipment a jurisdiction could
purchase; what, if any, training courses would be mandated or
recommended; and what, if any, percentage of funds would have to
be distributed to local public safety officials as opposed to
State, tribal, and regional officials.
<p>
<i>Technical Assistance and Equipment</i> 
<p>
Several commenters discussed the definition of technical
assistance in addition to equipment issues. All the comments
that included definitions of technical assistance identified the
need for equipment in that definition. Therefore, these topics
are being discussed together in this section.
<p>
Some commenters suggested that the Department use the 
Transportation External Coordination Working Group definition of 
technical assistance cited in the text above. Another suggested
using the Department's 1992 Draft Options Paper definition, also
cited above. 
<p>
Other suggestions were more broad in their application,
encompassing such things as emergency response equipment,
inspection equipment, assistance in route planning, emergency
response plan development, course development and exercises,
tracking capability, equipment and training for hospital
personnel, 24-hour access to Federal radiological safety
personnel, carrier qualifications, and funding, among others.
<p>
The Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors
questioned the need for equipment, especially for local
responders. They argued that the low risk of these shipments
does not justify a response capability beyond what currently
exists. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, on the other
hand, offered their assistance to the Department in providing
technical assistance and equipment to responders through their
role as providers of emergency and disaster preparedness for
State, tribal, and local governments.
<p>
One of the broader views on equipment came from the Council
of State Governments-Midwestern Office. They believe the
Department should supply funding for equipment, its maintenance
and calibration, and that States should have funding to purchase
computer software and hardware to assist with monitoring and
response activities.
<p>
<i>Concerns of Rural and Tribal Governments</i>
<p>
Many comments reflected concerns of jurisdictions in rural
parts of the country and of tribal governments. Issues of
concern to tribal governments are often very separate because of
their sovereign nation status. However, in many instances,
concerns overlap with those of rural jurisdictions.

Comments received that dealt directly with tribal issues
reiterated the Department's responsibility to work with tribes
on a government-to-government basis and to fulfill the
Department's Trust responsibility towards tribal governments.
One comment encouraged the Department to begin direct
communications with tribal governments near reactor locations to
address their particular concerns. The Department was also 
encouraged to contact tribal governments who may not know they
could have NWPA shipments crossing their lands.
<p>
The Department was also encouraged to take extra steps to
address the lack of infrastructure and resources on many of the
tribal lands that will be crossed by NWPA shipments. This should
include providing resources to allow tribes to participate in
the OCRWM program and to begin early to build an emergency
response infrastructure for those tribes lacking basic
infrastructure. One comment urged expansion of the cooperative
agreement with the National Congress of American Indians to help
facilitate communication with tribal governments.
<p>
Other commenters made suggestions about how a Section 180(c) 
program could address the concerns specific to rural areas. Rural
jurisdictions often rely heavily on volunteer public safety
personnel with high turnover rates, they serve large areas with
few staff, have few resources for training, and little or no
ability to travel to obtain training. The commenters encouraged
the Department to offer training in the community where the
local responders reside and to guarantee that certain levels of
training and equipment would be supplied.
<p>
Both tribal governments and rural local and state governments
expressed concern about lack of infrastructure or basic funding
and personnel to build infrastructure. The transportation
emergency response workshops sponsored by the National Congress
of American Indians through their cooperative agreement with the
Department of Energy, are a way to address tribal concerns. This
preliminary type of awareness training may help provide some of
the basic knowledge and know-how commenters mentioned as
lacking.
<p>
How much training and assistance is available for any
eligible jurisdiction will depend on how Section 180(c) policy
is defined. What training goals are set for what level of public
safety official will give an indication of the assistance
available at various governmental levels. These types of
decisions will also determine whether the Department provides
funding for the State and tribe to distribute as they see fit,
whether certain portions of funding are required to be spent at
the local level, whether training is proscribed at one or two 
locations around the country, or whether the Department sends
materials to the local jurisdiction for their own self-study.
<p> 
The Department has made no decisions regarding Section 180(c)
policy or the associated definitions and activities discussed
above.  These comments and others received throughout the
development of the Policy and Procedures will be considered in
the Department's decisions.
<p>
B. Section 180(c) Procedures
<p>
Of the options for implementation outlined in the Preliminary
Draft Options paper and the January Notice of Inquiry, no
clear-cut choice was identified in the comments. Some commenters
suggested additional sources to consider for implementation
procedures, and a few suggested new combinations of existing
options. 
<p>
One theme found among comments on procedural options was the 
request to minimize the administrative burden on all parties.
Depending on the perspective of the commenter, this appeared as
requests to either enhance or avoid existing programs. The theme
also surfaced as requests to limit layers of bureaucracy and
administration through which funding must be passed.
<p>
(1) Use Established Federal Agency Programs Other Than the
Department's
<p> 
From the State perspective, the Texas Department of Public
Safety,  Division of Emergency Management commented that
receiving additional assistance through an existing and familiar
program would be the least administratively burdensome. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency Comprehensive Cooperative
Agreement program, and the Research and Special Programs
Administration program, under the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act were both mentioned as good options to avoid 
multiple Federal agency coordination requirements. New assistance
programs, some felt, would create new administrative burdens.    
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency commented extensively
with descriptions of their current regulatory authority to
monitor and assess emergency plans and preparedness and a
proposal for how they could administer the Section 180(c)
program. This agency has current training programs and expertise
in the emergency management field.  Although a commenter
criticized the agency for placing emphasis on preparations for
nuclear attacks rather than transportation incidents,  the
Federal Emergency Agency stressed their all-hazards approach to 
preparedness that includes radioactive materials shipments within
the larger scope of emergency preparedness.
<p>    
The Nuclear Energy Institute commented that a separate
program for Section 180(c) in addition to the Research and
Special Programs Administration under the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act program will force utilities to pay twice for
emergency preparedness. They suggested that working with RSPA
could address this issue.
<p> 
Both tribal and non-tribal commenters identified problems 
associated with existing Federal programs and a dissimilar
approach to tribal assistance. Many concluded that the
Department will need to address tribes in separate agreements.
Also, it was suggested that the Department explore more current
funding mechanisms used by tribes such as the Department of
Housing and Urban Development Community Development and Block
Grant Program.
<p>
Many county commenters expressed concern that any additional 
involvement of the Federal government would detract from the
amount of funding ultimately destined for training costs and
equipment. Others cited a diminished focus on NWPA shipments,
Nuclear Waste Fund issues, government downsizing, or added
administration as negative aspects of this option. The
Commercial Vehicle Safety Association also pointed out that it
may put expertise and training further away from the intended 
delivery point.
<p>
(2) Establish Agreements With State, Local, Tribal, and Other 
Organizations
<p>     
This option prompted a variety of interpretations. Some
identified the potential improvements in regional cooperation
and efficiency as the biggest benefit to establishing agreements
with organizations.  Agreements or Memoranda of Understanding
between recipients, agreements between the Department and
recipients, or agreements between the Department and regional or
national coordinating organizations were all discussed. Overall,
State and regional coordination was identified as a benefit.
   <p> 
This option, specifically through an additional agreement
with the National Congress of American Indians, was indicated as
a potential solution to the Department ensuring up front
consultation with tribal recipients. It was suggested that
expansion of cooperative agreements with tribes would be
beneficial, particularly in light of the differences between
tribes and other recipients governments.
<p>
Many commenters, however, after praising the benefits of 
cooperative agreements pointed out that their development is a
lengthy, involved process and may take too long to implement
effectively. Two specifically cited the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant program, which has developed over six years and only
involves seven States substantively.
 <p>
Also, this option was named as an unnecessary administrative
layer that would take away from total funding to be spent on
training.
<p>
Some other organizations were suggested for total or partial 
implementation or training support. The Association of American 
Railroads' Technical Training Center in Pueblo, Colorado is well
suited to train emergency responders for rail incidents and is
currently in operation. The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance
has worked closely with the Department to develop enhanced
uniform inspection standards and train inspectors.
<p>
(3) Establish a Department-Wide Grant Program
<p>
Response to this option was mixed. Some called it
inappropriate or difficult, citing the Nuclear Waste Fund issues
of commingling funds or the inability to coordinate with the
diverse shipping campaigns of the Department in a timely manner.
Another commenter noted that the fewer points-of-contact between
the Department and stakeholders would be beneficial.
<p>
One comment praised the current training courses offered at
the Nevada Test Site and encouraged the Department to include
them in Section 180(c) training. Another commenter suggested a
review of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant project as an
effective implementation of similar goals. However, it was noted
that this project targeted a smaller and better identified
group, and modifications would be necessary.
<p>
(4) Establish an OCRWM Grant Program 
<p>
Many commenters saw this option as the most direct funding
option.  Some pointed to a minimized bureaucracy and
administration, increased flexibility, and a resultant reduction
in competition with other funding priorities as benefits of
distributing Section 180(c) assistance without involving other
programs. Also, the diversity of recipients and increased
Department control and accountability were mentioned as
benefits.
<p>
The Western Interstate Energy Board commented on this option 
favorably, provided that such a grant program incorporates
flexibility to allow States to coordinate the training and
funding. The Southern States Energy Board and the National
Conference of State Legislatures both identified this option as
favorable if additional national or regional coordination
efforts were also supported.
<p>
Many county commenters interpreted this option as similar to
the direct payments made to local governments through Yucca
Mountain oversight programs. They were generally in favor of
options that assist local governments as directly as possible.
<p>
(5) Use Elements From the Previous Four Groups
<p>
Two commenters agreed that a combination of OCRWM grants and
regional/national group cooperative agreements would be best.
This could provide the proper degree of direct contact between
the Department and recipient governments while also encouraging
national or regional planning, coordination, and uniformity.
<p>
It may be necessary to apply a combination of options to
encompass the wide array of objectives outlined in the NWPA.
This range was discussed above in part III.B.8, Combination of
Elements from the Previous Groups.
<p>
C. Applicability of Section 180(c) to Private Shipments 
<p>
Many States, counties, and regional groups urged that the
Section  180(c) program should apply to all commercial spent
nuclear fuel or defense high-level radioactive waste shipments
ultimately destined for a NWPA facility, whether or not those
shipments are transported to and stored on an interim basis at a
private facility. Commenters cited that any large-scale shipping
campaign of such materials will have virtually the same impact
on States and tribes as that envisioned in the NWPA.
<p>
The Department does not currently have the legal authority to
implement a program of financial and technical assistance for
shipments other than those outlined by the NWPA. However, the
many comments on this issue have been noted.
<p>
D. Policy Development Process
<p>
A few commenters questioned the Department's plans to issue a
Notice of Policy and Procedures rather than establish the
program in regulations. They voiced concern that implementation
of Section 180(c) through regulations is necessary to ensure
stability through changes of leadership within the Department
and that an interpretation of policy and procedures is ``less
robust.'' An expedited rulemaking process was suggested to
accommodate time constraints.
<p>
The Department's response to these comments is that
development of the Interpretation of Policy and Procedures has
followed and will continue to follow Notice and Comment
Procedures of the Federal Rulemaking process. At some future
date the option of converting Policy and Procedures to a
rulemaking may be acted upon. In development, however, it was
the Department's intent to remain flexible in order to work
through unforeseen problems without rulemaking requirements.

<b>V. Conclusion and Request for Submission</b>
<p> 
This paper has presented a discussion of options for Section
180(c) policy and procedures. The subjects discussed here should
not be viewed as the only potential options for the program.
Comments received on this Notice and continuing research on
these options may still identify aspects of the program not
discussed here that will be included in the Notice of Proposed
Policy and Procedures, which the Department intends to publish
in 1996. The purpose of this document has been to share with 
stakeholders the research to date and request additional comments
from interested parties.
<p>    
The Department solicits comments from the public on all
aspects of Section 180(c) implementation.
