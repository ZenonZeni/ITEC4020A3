<H2> EMERGING AWARENESS </H2>

<P>   As society develops new awareness of the importance of natural foods we understand why we should eat them. In the fast-paced lives we live, it is difficult to consume the recommended seven cups of fruits and vegetables every day. It is even difficult or impractical for many people to obtain them.</P>
 <P>  As our scientific community learns more about our foods, they are also learning what they contain. It is an almost everyday occurrence in national news about some researcher finding a new substance in broccoli, cauliflower, carrots or whatever. The news expounds these new "finds" are linked to cancer, birth defects, asthma, arthritis, etc. These substances have been in our foods all along but we are just beginning to learn about them.</P>
<P>    One thing is for sure, our bodies, and the trillions of cells that make it up, were designed to have them to metabolize properly, stay healthy and live a productive life. Without reasonable amounts of them, our cells and organs simply could not function properly.   When this happens, we see signs of deficiencies such as chronic infections, improper healing of wounds, lack of energy, unbalanced blood chemistry, nervousness and anxiety, lack of mental acuity and all kinds of degenerative diseases.</P>

<H2>"PHYTO"</H2>
<P>   Our digestive system is efficient in digesting and absorbing nutrients from fruits and vegetables.  It is now understood that we obtain the basic three food groups from vegetables, that is fats, proteins and carbohydrates.  We need them for tissue repair, growth and development and the production of hormones, enzymes and other substances. We also get energy in the form of calories from them.</P>
<P>   A whole new area has come into view the last few years--what the scientific community calls "phytochemicals." In the nutrition industry, we call them "phytonutrients." Actually, both terms are correct. They are chemicals and also nutrients. "Phyto" is the term used in botany, herbal science and in the scientific and natural health communities to label any substance coming from a plant. The term actually comes from the Greek word phyton, meaning "a plant."  So then, phytonutrients are nutritional substances that come from plants.</P>

<H2>SPECIFIC PHYTONUTRIENTS</H2>
<P>   Numerous phytonutrients have been identified and isolated. Yet common sense tells us that there are many more. A partial listing of some of them includes allyl sulfides in garlic, onions, leeks, chives and shallots; capsaicin in chili peppers; genistein in soy beans; polyphenol catechins in green and black teas; camosol in rosemary; lignans in flaxseed; glycerrhizin in licorice root; limonenes in citrus fruits; sulforaphane in broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, turnips and kale; lycopene in tomatoes, red grapefruit, watermelon and apricots; alpha-carotene in carrots and seaweed; beta-carotene in carrots, squash, apricots, peaches, red, yellow and dark green vegetables; lutein/zeaxanthin in yellow squash, spinach, collards, mustard and turnip greens; polyphenols (bioflavonoids) in red grapes and wine, artichokes, strawberries and blueberries, anthocanins in cranberries and currents; gingerol in gingeroot; phytic acid in rye, wheat, rice, lima beans, sesame seeds, peanuts and soybeans; phenethyl isothiocyanates 
in horseradish, mustard, cabbage and turnips; saponins in kidney beans, chickpeas and lentils; onoterpenes in basil, carrots, parsley, mint, cabbage, citrus and caraway seeds; indoles in brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale and dark green leafy vegetables.</P>

<H2>SUPER GREEN ALGAE</H2>
<P>   These "super foods" are simply power houses of phytonutrients and high quality, easily utilized nutrients.  They are cultured in controlled environments to insure they are free of chemicals and are one of the most highly concentrated sources of nutrition available. RICH 'N GREEN contains three of the most important ones, Chlorella, Spirulina and Hydra Green.  They have special value because of their large amount of chlorophyll, which is a great detoxifier in the body.  They are high in RNA (ribonucleic acids), which are used in the body to produce DNA. These super algae are also rich in carotenes and lypoic acid.</P>

<H2>MAITAKE & REISHI MUSHROOMS</H2>
<P>   A number of mushrooms have been used by eastern civilizations for centuries. Maitake and Reishi are two of the most valuable because of their ability in supporting the immune system. They are also known as good protectors of the liver.</P>

<H2>BARLEY & WHEAT GRASS</H2>
<P>   Grains such as barley and wheat all produce a grass. When it is in the early "sprout" stage it is loaded with incredible amounts of nutritional  value.   They are particularly rich in  plant enzymes, beta-carotene, Vitamins A, C and K, chlorophyll, RNA, DNA, antioxidants and amino acids.   They are simply a gold mine of phytonutrients fitting for a healthy diet.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  The food concentrates from the Amazon Rainforests in RICH 'N GREEN tablets have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting sustainable natural resources like the phytonutrients in RICH 'N GREEN tablets and other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying this valuable resource.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>


<H2>HOW TO USE RICH 'N GREEN</H2>
<P>   There is no iron-clad method how to take RICH 'N GREEN tablets. Two RICH 'N GREEN tablets supply the equivalent amount of vitamins, minerals, plant enzymes and other phytonutrients as one full cup of fresh vegetables.  The U. S. Government recommends seven one-cup servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Adjust to your needs.  If it is difficult for you to obtain and prepare your daily vegetables, these tablets are very convenient.   The foods in RICH 'N GREEN tablets have not been cooked and are in the most valuable "raw" state. So, you also obtain the greatest benefit from their phytonutrients.</P>
