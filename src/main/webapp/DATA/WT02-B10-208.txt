<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During 1994, the Department of Nursing attained full staffing. Nurses and Mental Health Therapy Aides applied for both full and part-time positions at Psychiatric Institute, because of interesting assignments in our research areas and acute setting, and opportunities to attend sophisticated education programs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Nursing Staff Development department focused on a number of topics pertinent to our patient population. Education was provided concerning the Adolescent and Older Adult, as well as Dual Diagnosis, Cultural Awareness, and the Interrelationship of Physical/<BR>
Mental Illness.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department's most significant contribution to the Institute was the continuation of exemplary nursing practice. As with many other institutions offering nursing services, the department provides twenty-four-hour per day care. While there is overlapping of duties on each shift, each tour provides its own special contributions, as patients' and families' needs change throughout the day. Due to their expertise, proximity, and direct care responsibilities nurses and aides respond immediately to both psychiatric and medical emergencies, providing necessary interventions and support.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two nursing staff members received awards for outstanding service. Ms. Gretchen Seirmarco was selected for the 1994 Nursing Excellence Award, and Mr. Peter Biggins was recognized by his colleagues for the 1994 Mental Health Therapy Aide Award for Excellence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Group work remained a priority on a number of units and two new groups began. On PI6 ICU, Allen Spatafore, R.N. is leading Current Events, and on PI5 South, Frances Martinez, M.H.T.A. is running a Crafts Group. Other ongoing groups led by nursing personnel are: Horticulture, Smoking Cessation, Patient Pass, and Health Education on the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Washington Heights inpatient staff lead forums concerning Discharge Planning, Psychoeducation, Current Events, Unit Orientation, and issues concerning people with Mental Illness/Chemical Abuse. Nurses and mental health therapy aides of the General Clinical Research Unit are involved in Discharge, Health Awareness, Women's, Crafts, and Addictions Groups. Clinical Psychopharmacology nursing service staff members lead Multi-Family and Eating Disorder Groups. Children in the Day Hospital Program attend Social Skills Training, as well as Boys' and Girls' Groups.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Outpatient nurses and aides greatly contribute to patients remaining in the community. When patients have exacerbations of problems/symptoms, they may often be first noted by OPD staff who provide assessment and assist them in obtaining appropriate treatment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nurses in outpatient research settings are also facilitating protocols and contributing to the research efforts. Registered nurses are employed by the Children's Day Program, Biological Psychiatry, Clinical Psychopharmacology, and Brain Imaging, as well as in the Lithium, Anxiety Disorders, HIV, and Depression Evaluation Clinics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nursing personnel are also encouraged to share their expertise in the community. Ms. Kathleen Ibrahim, Assistant to the Director of Nursing for Staff Development, presented "Perspectives on Multiple Family Group Therapy with Eating Disordered Patients," at the Society for Education and Research in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing. Linda Fitzsimons, ECT Nurse, was a guest lecturer at Adelphi University's Masters Degree in Social Work Program where she spoke on "Group Psychotherapy with the Elderly"; she also contributed to a number of publications concerning ECT and depression.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A number of personnel were also awarded advanced degrees, certificates, or honors. Kathleen Ibrahim completed the Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing program in Psychoanalysis at Columbia University School of Nursing. Other degree recipients included: Lonnie Crews, M.H.T.A. earned an Associate in Applied Science, with a major in nursing; and Nevada Solano, M.H.T.A. earned an Associate in Human Services. Mary Ellen Lovrin, R.N. and Dee Mancuso, R.N. were inducted into the International Nursing Honor Society.
