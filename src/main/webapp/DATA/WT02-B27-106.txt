<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Current Perspectives On Metacognition</H2>

Recent Research has generally supported the notion that metacognitive strategies are helpful to students in producing more positive academic outcomes. Some specifics:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> A large percentage of students and adults fail to use appropriate metacognitive strategies spontaneously<BR>
<BR>
<LI> better students and experts tend to report using metacognitive strategies more often than poorer students and novices<BR>
<BR>
<LI> performance tends to go up on a task once metacognitive strategies have been taught or elucidated<BR>
<BR>
<LI> many identified metacognitive strategies are often acquired without direct instruction (even children under the age of two demonstrate the acquisition of primitive repair strategies without direct instruction)<BR>
</UL>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Metacognition is not a Panacea</H3>
<UL>
<LI> some critical mass of knowledge is needed in a topic before students can successfully invoke metacognitive strategies<BR>
<BR>
<LI> that students (especially young or novice students) may be overconfident with their answers or overestimate comprehension, thus reducing the likelihood that they will employ a metacognitive strategy to correct for errors<BR>
<BR>
<LI> that many strategies require significant practice to overlearn to the point where they reduce cognitive load, making it more likely that students will abandon these strategies<BR>
<BR>
<LI> that transfer of strategies is problematic -- i.e., often does not happen<BR>
<BR>
<LI> that classroom variables such as mastery orientation can play a role in supporting a student's use of metacognitive strategies<BR>
<BR>
<LI> and that student variables such as achievement motivation, depression, locus of control, or perceived self-efficacy might influence the utilization of metacognitive strategies.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Summary</H3>

Taken as a whole, the field of metacognition represents the potential to improve and refine the educational process, especially for poor performers.<BR>
