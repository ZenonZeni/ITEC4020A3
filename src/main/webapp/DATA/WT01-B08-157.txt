<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Unfortunately, at this time our system is not working exactly as
planned.  The only scent we have successfully transmitted is a mixture
of cold pizza and dirty socks! (and it is suspected that the smell was
already there in the room of the at-home tester) It will be a long time
before our patented Scent-O-Net(tm) is truly up and running!  It's still in
its early stages of testing.  But give it a second try- I hear
"Scratching the Monitor" works better.</FONT></B></CENTER>
