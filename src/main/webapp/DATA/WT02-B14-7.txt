Proposals to Reduce Illegal

<tt>On May 3, 1995, Senators Kennedy (D-MA), Boxer (D-CA), and Simon (D-IL),
formally introduced President Clinton's proposals to deal with illegal
immigration, S754, the Immigration Enforcement Improvements Act</tt><p>
<tt>of 1995.  The Administration bill is similar to the proposal of Senator
Simpson (R-WY), S 269, increasing the likelihood that immigration reform will
be enacted in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The administration's proposal would permit US border communities as a
"local option" to impose a $3 per vehicle fee on border crossers, with the
funds used to add staff and crossing points that would speed legal crossings
and deter illegal immigration.  Other features of the proposal include:
testing a pilot worker identification system, adding 1,500 INS employees over
the next three years, reducing the appeals permitted to aliens in deportation
proceedings, and allowing the use of racketeering laws to wiretap and prosecute
alien smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>The administration proposal would double employer penalties for hiring
unauthorized workers if the employer was also guilty of violating other laws,
such as not paying the minimum wage.  The White House also plans to increase
the number of inspectors who investigate immigration and wage-and-hour
violations.<b> </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The number of documents that a new employee could present to an
employer to prove authorization to work would be reduced from 26 to six:
resident alien card or "green cards," employment authorization issued to other
work-authorized aliens, a Social Security card, a U.S. passport, a driver's
license, or a state-issued identification card.  US birth certificates would no
longer be acceptable to prove authorization to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton acknowledged that the US "was built by immigrants," but he then
asserted that the US "won't tolerate immigration by people whose first act is
to break the law as they enter the country."  An April 1995 Times Mirror poll
found that 62 percent of all Americans, up from 58 percent in March 1994,
believe that the US is losing ground in dealing with illegal
immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 6, 1995, President Clinton pledged to expedite the deportation of
criminal aliens from the US.  Under US law, there must be a separate proceeding
to determine whether convicted "criminal aliens" should be deported. The US
deported about 40,000 aliens who had been convicted of crimes in 1994, and
there is a backlog of another 100,000 awaiting deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>US Attorney General Janet Reno announced on May 22 a one-month pilot
program at the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles that would place 46 INS agents
at the facility to detain all illegal immigrants upon their release.  The
inmates will be taken into federal custody, transported to a special
immigration court, and promptly deported, most on the same day they are
released from jail.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS expects to deport 1,500 illegal aliens through this program in June
1995.  About 20 percent of the inmates in Men's Central Jail are illegal
immigrants, according to the Sheriff's Department.</tt><p>
<tt>In Congress, there are bills pending to require that aliens apprehended
twice in the US be returned to at least 300 miles from the US border.  State
and local governments would be required to cooperate with the INS or lose
federal funds.  Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) heads the Congressional Task Force on
Immigration Reform that is expected to make recommendations to reduce illegal
immigration to the House subcommittee in June 1995.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Western
Growers to Ask for Guest Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The proposed crackdown on illegal immigration has led California's growers
to call for a guest worker program that would permit them to legally hire
foreign workers.  Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) is expected to introduce in June 1995
a 35-page proposal billed as a tool to "manage migration."  A similar measure
is expected to be introduced in the House.</tt><p>
<tt>The growers' proposal would substitute attestation for certification to
determine whether foreign workers are needed.  Instead of requesting permission
to import foreign workers from the US Department of Labor, and then waiting for
DOL to certify that the grower tried to recruit US workers at prevailing wages
and with offers of free housing, transportation, and contracts for work,
growers would simply assert that they had taken these steps, and DOL would be
required to approve their applications unless the applications were obviously
incomplete or inaccurate.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one scenario, farmers would fax applications that include promises to
recruit local workers and to pay prevailing wages to the US Department of
Labor.  DOL could review the request for completeness and accuracy, but not
initiate an investigation unless there was a complaint.</tt><p>
<tt>Unless DOL disapproved within seven days, growers would be free to employ
foreign workers, either workers in the US, or those abroad.  Details on how
foreign workers would obtain what would be a new work authorization visa are
sketchy.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers assert that their new program would encourage foreign workers to
leave the US when there is no work, but they have not yet spelled out
how.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the arguments in favor of a new guest worker program are familiar.
Cheap labor is necessary to have cheap food, Americans won't do farm work, so
there is no correlation between US unemployment rates and the availability of
farm workers, and it is well known that agriculture relies heavily on
recently-arrived immigrant workers, so the US should openly deal with the
reality of immigrant farm workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The counter arguments are also well established.  Most begin with a
restatement of economic theory--there is no shortage of workers, only a
shortage of wages.  Wages have stagnated in agriculture, and if immigrant farm
workers did not continually arrive, farm wages would rise, and more US workers
would seek or remain farm workers.  Because of the higher wages, the demand for
immigrant farm workers would fall--farmers would learn how to produce food with
fewer workers, or the US might import more labor-intensive crops<b>.
</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Under current law, growers anticipating labor shortages can bring to
the US non-immigrant workers under the H-2A program.  The H-2A program requires
growers to ask DOL to certify their need for workers at least 60 days before
the shortage is anticipated.  The H-2A program also requires recruitment in
places where US workers are found, and requires that growers offer to US and
foreign workers housing and round-trip transportation.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 3,000 US farmers requested 17,000 H2-A workers in FY94.  About 470
California farms and ranches apply for H2-A workers annually.  Most of the H-2A
farm workers in California are sheepherders, primarily from Chile, Mexico and
Peru. </tt><p>
<tt>California Attorney General Dan Lungren renewed his appeal for a guest
worker program on May 3.  Lungren's proposal would require foreign workers to
deposit a portion of their pay in an escrow account to encourage them to return
home.  Lungren distinguishes his proposal from the Bracero program because, he
says, it would not require foreign workers to stay with one US employer,
thereby limiting exploitation.</tt><p>

Cubans to enter the
US</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>After two months of secret talks with representatives of Fidel Castro, the
Clinton Administration on May 2 announced that the 21,000 Cubans in Guantanamo
would be admitted to the US, but that any Cubans headed for the US in the
future would be returned to Cuba.  According to reviews of how 35 years of
providing immigrant status to Cubans was reversed, political and safety
concerns forced the change in policy.</tt><p>
<tt>Politically, it was thought that riots in Guantanamo, or another wave of
rafters in the summer of 1995, might hurt Clinton's chances of carrying Florida
in 1996.  It was also feared that the mostly young men held in Guantanamo could
not be held there indefinitely, or returned to Cuba, without violence.</tt><p>
<tt>The trick was to figure out how to solve the problem created by the safe
haven policy established in summer 1994 without setting off another wave of
migration to the US.  The compromise was to count the 21,000 Guantanamo Cubans
against the guaranteed 20,000 immigrant visas provided for Cubans each year.
</tt><p>
<tt>By counting the Guantanamo Cubans against the 20,000 quota over the next
three years, fewer visas will be available for Cubans who apply to emigrate in
Havana.  This alleviated concerns by Floridians that they would again be
flooded with refugees, but angered Cuban-Americans because fewer slots are
available for those wishing to emigrate from Cuba.</tt><p>
<tt>The Administration asserted that the policy shift would save money.  The US
was spending $1 million per day to care for Cubans in Guantanamo, and the
military had requested $100 million to upgrade facilities for Cubans there.
</tt><p>
<tt>Most Cubans who come to the US move in with relatives, but the State
Department said that it would seek $100 million for medical assistance and
language training for the Guantanamo Cubans.</tt><p>
<tt>Leading Florida politicians welcomed the policy shift, saying it was the
best compromise to deal with a difficult situation.  Many Cuban Americans
welcomed the admission of Cubans in Guantanamo, but protested the new policy
that, in the future, will have the US Coast Guard returning to Cuba persons
leaving the island in small boats.  On May 9, the first 13 Cubans picked up at
sea were returned to Cuba .</tt><p>
<tt>Cubans blocked traffic in the Miami area to protest the policy change, and
on May 18, it was announced that the White House aide who negotiated the
agreement with Cuba would no longer deal in Cuban affairs.  However, it was
reported that many Cuban-Americans disapproved of the disruptive
protests.</tt><p>
<tt>Some House Democrats and Republicans criticized the Clinton administration
for "trusting the word" of Castro. About 45 percent of the Cubans in Miami
approved of the new policy. </tt><p>
<tt>There are about 1.5 million Cuban-Americans in the US, and 11 million
Cubans in Cuba.</tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban-American National Foundation, the most powerful Cuban group in
the US, wants to toughen the sanctions that the US has imposed on Cuba.  It
supports, and the Clinton Administration opposes, a proposal in Congress to
prohibit the importation of sugar from any country that buys sugar from Cuba.
The US pays a premium price for imported sugar. </tt><p>
<tt>Canada and Mexico, Cuba's two largest trading partners, also oppose
tightening the sanctions on Cuba.</tt><p>
<tt>Supporters of the Florida version of Prop. 187 say that the admission of
the Guantanamo Cubans should help the passage their initiative, which would
eliminate health, education and welfare benefits for illegal immigrants.  The
initiative would not affect Cuban exiles, but the image of thousands of
Florida-bound immigrants becomes blurred with illegal immigrants, say backers
of the Save Our State initiative.   </tt><p>
<tt>A second initiative, called FLA-187, has begun to circulate.  It also calls
for making English the official language of all state and local governments.
</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on May 19 announced that the last 203 Haitian children in
Guantanamo will be removed by June 30, 1995; it is widely assumed that most
will be admitted to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban agreement did not mention Haitians, and on May 3, the US returned
27 Haitians to Haiti.  There were on May 1, 1995 about 350 Haitian children
under 17 among the almost 500 remaining Haitians in two camps in Guantanamo,
and they attend schools while awaiting a decision about their fate.  Most of
the 21,000 Haitians in Guantanamo were repatriated after November 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>It has proven difficult to find the children's parents and relatives in
Haiti, and some of the children hope to be admitted to the US, as are Cuban
children from the 12 Cuban camps for whom life in Guantanamo is considered by
the INS to be "an extraordinary hardship." Haitian advocates in the US alleged
that, in some instances, Haitian children were returned to strangers in
Haiti.</tt><p>

<tt>Republican success during their first 100 days of considering the Contract
with America has been credited to, inter alia, a willingness to march in
lockstep to approve even controversial measures.  But the debate over how to
deal with legal and illegal immigration has split Republicans.</tt><p>
<tt>Republican presidential hopefuls have begun to address immigration issues.
Patrick Buchanan has called for a five-year moratorium on most legal
immigration to allow the US to "assimilate" recent arrivals, a constitutional
amendment to deny citizenship to the children of illegal aliens, and stepped up
efforts to prevent illegal immigration, including a 100 mile, double-layered
fence at the most significant border-crossing points. </tt><p>
<tt>Buchanan has also called for a national law based on California's Prop.
187, which creates a state-run screening system to prevent illegal aliens from
obtaining welfare and medical benefits; Buchanan also endorses making English
the official language.  Phil Gramm and Pete Wilson have also staked out tough
immigration control stances--Gramm has called for a "lifetime" ban on immigrant
access to federal means-tested benefits such as Medicaid.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Bob Dole is likely to follow the lead of Senator Alan Simpson on
immigration reform, supporting efforts to reduce illegal immigration, and
reducing legal immigration by about 25 percent.  Dole is reportedly skeptical
about barring legal immigrants from federal welfare programs.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Republicans favor more immigration, but none of them is running for
president.  House Majority Leader Dick Armey recently asserted that US problems
would not be diminished by less immigration, and may be ameliorated by more.
He decried restrictions on immigration, and suggested that the US "should be
thinking about increasing legal immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>Armey has vowed to oppose an improved work place identification system.
The Commission on Immigration Reform, President Clinton, and leaders on
immigration reform in both parties endorse at least pilot programs that would
make it harder for illegal aliens to use false documents to obtain US
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans such as Armey represent the libertarian wing of the party that
wants as little government as possible, while Buchanan represents the
reconstructionist wing that wants to use government to reshape society as they
think it should be.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 3, 1995, California Governor Wilson confirmed that in 1978 his first
wife employed an illegal Mexican maid in their home, paying her $25 per day.
There was no federal penalty for US employers who hired illegal aliens until
1986, and the maid became a legal immigrant in 1979.</tt><p>
<tt>California Democrats called Wilson a hypocrite for taking such a strong
stand against illegal immigration, while having hired an illegal alien.  Wilson
and his former wife owe about $3,000 in back Social Security taxes and
penalties.</tt><p>
<tt>All other announced Presidential contenders for 1996 have asserted that
they did not employ illegal aliens.</tt><p>

<tt>On May 26, 1995, the US followed the lead of Canada and issued new
guidelines that recognize rape, domestic violence and other forms of violence
against women as possible political persecution, and thus grounds for receiving
asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>According to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, the guidelines are meant to
sensitize asylum officers to gender-based discrimination and provide a means to
evaluate a woman's asylum claim.  The guidelines do not lower asylum standards:
women must still show that their personal political convictions made them a
target of state persecution. </tt><p>
<tt>The guidelines are not expected to affect asylum cases involving forced
sterilization or abortion in China.  On May 2, a federal judge held that these
practices alone do not constitute grounds for political asylum because there
existence does not constitute individual political persecution. </tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be a debate whether women in the US who might be subject
to persecution in e.g., Algeria or Saudi Arabia because they refuse to veil
themselves should be granted asylum in the US.  In 1993, Canada granted asylum
to a Saudi student who argued that she would face persecution if she was seen
in public with her hair and face uncovered.  The US does not generally grant
asylum to persons who argue that their lifestyles clash with cultural mores at
home, and thus they would face persecution if they returned.</tt><p>
<tt>Lawyers asked that the 136 Golden Venture aliens still being detained be
released while their asylum appeals are processed.  According to the lawsuit,
about 40 percent of all Chinese asylum applications have been approved, but
only 14 percent of those from the Golden Venture have been approved, allegedly
proving that the US government manipulated the consideration of the Golden
Venture applications to send a signal that applications from persons smuggled
into the US will not be considered favorably.  Most Chinese asylum applicants
base their claims on China's one-child policy.</tt><p>

Dual Citizenship and
Devaluation</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The Mexican Congress is considering a constitutional amendment that would
allow Mexicans to hold dual citizenship. Mexican immigrants in the US could
become US citizens, and keep their Mexican passports, plus enjoy all other
rights of Mexican citizenship except the right to vote in Mexican elections.
</tt><p>
<tt>If approved by the Mexican government as expected, some predict a surge of
Mexican applications for US citizenship among the five million Mexicans
residing in the US who might qualify for US citizenship (other estimates put
the number of Mexicans who might apply for dual citizenship at 1.5 to 2
million).  Permitting dual citizenship might create a powerful, pro-Mexican
lobby in the US, and increase the workload of US immigration
authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Some analysts speculated that the Mexican dual citizenship proposal is a
response to the attack Mexicans face in the US after the passage of Prop. 187
and similar initiates around the nation. </tt><p>
<tt>US press reports on Mexico's economic prospects were mixed.  The Clinton
Administration announced that the US bailout was working as intended, and that
Mexico was on the road to recovery.  On May 31, President Zedillo announced
that the economy would grow at a five percent per year clip once Mexico snapped
out of its current recession.  However, the official jobless rate rose to 5.7
percent in March 1995, and projections are that the economy will shrink by four
percent in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mexico, there appears to be increasing resentment against growing
inequality.  It was widely reported that rich Mexicans --the top 10 percent of
earners received 38 percent of the nation's income in 1992--were alerted to the
possibility of devaluation in December, when the new government had trouble
re-negotiating the pact between unions and employers.  These rich Mexicans
began a run on the peso, foreigners followed suit, and Mexico was forced to
devalue.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans who managed to convert their pesos into dollars before the
devaluation are richer than before, and sales of some luxury goods, such as
$50,000 Mercedes, were up 25 percent in the first quarter of 1995.  Expensive
restaurants are reportedly full, while medium-priced establishments are
struggling.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mexico, reports of middle-class suffering abound.  Some 10 to 20 million
of Mexico's 90 million people were considered to be middle class before the
peso devaluation on December 20, 1994, meaning that they had credit cars, owned
cars and often houses, and could afford to take vacations.  Many middle class
Mexicans believed that Mexico had turned the corner toward first world status,
and they borrowed freely in anticipation of a continued boom.</tt><p>
<tt>Crime is reportedly up sharply.  In addition to home and street thefts, US
businesses complain that criminals posing as police stop southbound trucks
loaded with merchandise and steal it.  Some 85 percent of US-Mexican trade
moves by truck, and US businesses complain that, until police corruption is
curbed, theft losses will drive up the Mexican prices of US goods.</tt><p>
<tt>For the first time in decades, Mexico's Congress of Labor, and  the
business and peasant organizations, who form a pillar of the ruling PRI,
canceled the traditional May 1 labor day parade.  Instead, "independent" unions
drew about 75,000 protesters to Mexico City's main square, where they
complained that the government's economic policies were hurting workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 2,000 threatened strikes in Mexico between January and April
1995, but fewer actual strikes than in any comparable period in the 1990s,
reflecting worker fears of job losses.  In Mexico City, the government
dissolved Ruta 100, the 4,000-bus, 14,000-driver transit service for the
Federal District, reportedly because the drivers' union protested government
economic policies.</tt><p>
<tt>The U.S. National Administrative Office (NAO) created by NAFTA's labor side
agreement said it will investigate charges that Sony fired workers at its Nuevo
Laredo maquildora because they tried to affiliate with the independent
Authentic Workers Front (FAT) union.  The NAO previously dismissed similar
complaints against General Electric and Honeywell.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's agricultural sector is in a crisis that is expected to produce
sharp reductions in production in 1995, and fewer farmers in the years ahead.
There are five to six million farmers in Mexico, including one to two million
landless workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994/95, the production of 10 basic grains during the winter/spring
growing season fell almost 40 percent, from 11 million tons to seven million
tons, and some predict that up to 10 million hectares will not be planted
during the spring-summer agricultural cycle because of low prices and high
credit and fertilizer costs. </tt><p>
<tt>Corn tortilla prices rose 26 percent in the Mexico City metropolitan area
in early April, to about 15 cents per kilo.  Mexico is obliged to permit the
tariff-free import of 2.5 million tons of corn from the U.S. and 100,000 tons
from Canada in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's more open political climate is seeing more open debates about how
to put the economy back on a sure footing.  There have been calls, for example,
to restructure the tax system to reward savings and tax consumption, so that
Mexico does not have to depend as heavily on foreign investment, and to step up
private and public investment in infrastructure.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico attracted about $5 billion of the $19 billion Foreign Direct
Investment that flowed to Latin America in 1993, and $8 of $22 billion in 1994.
Foreign investment in Mexico is currently governed by a Foreign Investment Law
enacted December 28, 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexico crisis may delay NAFTA's expansion to include Chile.  Chile, a
country of 14 million rich in natural resources, has been growing at a seven
percent annual rate over the past eight years.  Exports in 1994 were about $12
billion, including $2 billion worth of commodities sent to the US, and imports
were also $12 billion, including goods worth $2.5 bought from the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration in mid-May endorsed a bill to extend NAFTA's
free-trade provisions to Caribbean Basin Initiative countries.  Employer and
union representatives of apparel firms protested that extending free trade to
CBI nations would destroy their industries in the US.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">House
Solicits Immigration
Suggestions</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims on May 17 opened hearings
on legal immigration reform.  Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX) noted that
immigration has been increasing, and that there appears to be no "natural" end
to the current wave of immigrants in sight.  Smith argued that narrow special
interests have replaced the broader national interest in the making of
immigration policy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Ranking minority member John Bryant (D-TX) expressed concern that legal
immigrants and non immigrants are displacing US workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Susan Martin, executive director of the Commission on Immigration Reform,
promised CIR recommendations on legal immigration reform in June 1995.  She
noted that legal immigration dropped by about 10 percent in FY94 versus FY 93,
from about 880,000 to about 800,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Preliminary data suggest that there will be about 800,000 legal immigrants
in FY95, which ends September 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Almost all of the witnesses agreed with Martin's three-pronged definition
of the US national interest, viz, to admit close family members of US citizens
and settled immigrants, needed workers, and humanitarian (refugee) newcomers.
The disagreement came in answer to the three fundamental immigration questions
of how many, from where, and in what status newcomers should arrive.</tt><p>
<tt>Also testifying was British-born journalist, Peter Brimelow, whose book
Alien Nation is, some say, doing for the immigration debate what Charles
Murray's book Losing Ground did for the argument that government assistance
hurts rather than helps poor Americans.  Brimelow argues that immigration is a
luxury that the US can no longer afford, because too many of today's immigrants
are too poor and too poorly educated to be assets in America.  </tt><p>
<tt>Brimelow recommended that the US limit annual legal immigration to 200,000,
which he estimates to be annual emigration.  The key failure of US immigration
policy, according to Brimelow, is that the US admits only one in six legal
immigrants on the basis of US economic needs.</tt><p>
<tt>In the ensuing debate, it became clear that there is widespread concern
about the logic of admitting minority immigrants into a country that has a
system of preferences for all minorities, including immigrants not descended
from those who suffered discrimination at the hands of US governments.
Political scientist Peter Skerry argued that, if the current system of group
rights and group politics were ended, there may be less need to worry about the
large numbers of minority immigrants who arrive, since they would not be
asserting claims to preferences.</tt><p>
<tt>A recurring issue was whether the "immigration problem" was due primarily
to the number of new arrivals, or who is arriving.  Some argued that only
numbers--and perhaps skills--matter; others argued that rights to entitlements,
such as minority preferences in the US, were the most important factor in
deciding who should immigrate.  </tt><p>
<tt>In a debate between Brimelow and TV Think Tank host Ben Wattenburg,
Brimelow argued that the 1965 Immigration Act unexpectedly triggered today's
immigration wave, and that the US is inflicting current and future assimilation
problems on itself by not stopping the unexpected wave of immigrants.
Wattenburg countered that the immigration moratorium favored by Brimelow would
put the US on the same demographic track as most of western Europe--below
replacement fertility, and thus producing an aging and stable population that
will cease to be the dominant world power.</tt><p>
<tt>Several witnesses stressed that legal immigration requires difficult
trade-offs that Congress can no longer avoid.  It was emphasized that, when
Congress considered legal immigration reform in the late 1980s, with the aim of
increasing the proportion of needed workers in the flow, the number of
immigrants was expanded so that there was no need to make difficult
trade-offs.</tt><p>
<tt>However, in a preview of the 1995 Congressional debate, witnesses
representing narrow interests such as high tech computer firms made the
seemingly contradictory argument that, even though the process for creating
software is becoming so mobile that some companies already employ e.g., Indian
programmers who are linked by satellite continuously to programmers in the US
and Europe, the US immigration system should make it easy for US firms who want
to import foreign programmers.  </tt><p>
<tt>In reaction to the 48 Hours story (See related story below) of how US
programmers were laid off and replaced by legal temporary foreigners from
India, an employer lobbyist argued that, in this case, the current system
worked as intended, since DOL has recommended that the offending company be
barred for one year from importing foreign workers.  Other witnesses argued
that the current system invites employer abuse, since employers simply "attest"
that they tried and failed to recruit US workers, and then they receive
permission practically automatically to import foreigners.  DOL investigates
only if there is a complaint, and the one year ban on importing more foreign
workers was considered by some to be inadequate.</tt><p>
<tt>A compromise between employers who want to continue getting skilled
temporary workers automatically via the attestation process, and unions who
want a detailed labor certification process, may lie in the adoption of one
aspect of the German sanctions system, which permits easy entry of skilled
workers, but also permits the confiscation of any profits earned by unlawfully
employing foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Most witnesses offered general proposals and guidelines for reforming legal
immigration.  Several echoed CIR Vice-Chair Lawrence Fuchs, who noted that the
major difference between mass immigration at the end and the beginning of the
20th century is that the almost one million legal immigrants arriving each year
at the end of the century are accompanied by large numbers of non-immigrants
(almost 25 million each year) and unauthorized aliens (an estimated two to
three million entries, and 300,000 settlers annually).  Fuchs notes that the
hope for economic betterment has long been the major motivation of immigrants,
although most of those hoping to improve their lot enter through family
unification channels.</tt><p>
<tt>It was noted several times that US immigration law begins with definitions
rather than clearly articulated goals of immigration policy, that few Americans
understand the current immigration system, and that today's complex system is,
in any event, poorly administered by the INS.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some urged that the US adopt a point system for admitting immigrants--all
persons wishing to immigrate to the US would apply, and they would receive
points for e.g., being young and educated and having US relatives and/or a US
job offer.  All persons who score above the cutoff level would then enter an
annual lottery or a queue.</tt><p>
<tt>Canada and Australia each admit about half of their annual immigration flow
through such point systems.  In Canada in 1993, for example, individuals could
score up to 34 points for education and training, 18 points for having work
experience in labor short occupations, 15 points for knowledge of English or
French, and 10 points each for having a job offer, being young, and being
personally suitable--70 pints is required for entry.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) plans to introduce in the summer of 1995 a
point system to admit legal immigrants, restarting the debate over how much
"expert systems" should be used to select immigrants.  On the one side are
mostly economists who argue that the US should use the scientific tools
available to pick immigrants most likely to succeed in the US, benefiting the
immigrants and the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On the other side are ethnic lobbies who argue that a point system would
exclude especially poorly-educated Mexicans, and those who argue that
family-based immigration does admit ambitious immigrants who will succeed in
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On May 10, the Senate heard testimony on a new, fraud-proof Social Security
card that would include individual biometric information on the person to whom
the card was issued.  Simpson envisions a two-part check:  the employer
verifying that the person presenting the card is the person to whom the card
was issued, and then the employer calling in the Social Security Number to a
database to verify it, much as credit card numbers are verified.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 270 million Social Security accounts in a nation of about 265
million.  The total cost of re-issuing Social Security cards is estimated to be
$3 to $6 billion, but this cost might be spread over many years, by, e.g.,
beginning with students and school leavers seeking their first jobs.</tt><p>

proposal at the May 26 Senate markup on SB 269, but the markup was

<tt>On May 11, the CBS-News TV program 48 Hours aired a segment on abuse of the
attestation procedures under which US employers can "attest" that they tried to
recruit US workers at prevailing wages, which allows them to bring into the US
temporary foreign professionals, such as computer programmers, to the US to
fill job vacancies.  One example of abuse was a New Jersey insurance company
that reportedly laid off 130 US programmers, and then replaced them with 130
programmers from India hired through a labor contractor.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the H-1B program, the US Department of Labor is permitted to review
employer attestations only for completeness and accuracy; DOL does not
investigate employers who are requesting H-1B workers unless there is a
credible complaint.  Some 42,000 H-1B visas were issued in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The hour-long show, entitled "Slamming the Door," also dealt with the rape
of a small girl by an illegal alien in a small town in Utah, the failure of the
INS to deport and keep out the US illegal aliens who have been convicted of
committing crimes here, and the costs borne by California and Florida to
provide medical care and education to immigrants and their children. </tt><p>
<tt>California reportedly spends $1.2 billion annually on medical care for
illegal aliens, in part because some Mexicans prefer to have their babies born
in the US because of the quality of medical care, and because the babies born
in the US are US citizens.  Prenatal care and emergency medical care are
available to all residents, but MediCal fraud investigators find that, in many
cases, aliens provide US addresses, but are not residents.</tt><p>
<tt>In an especially telling segment, the show reviewed how the INS sends
so-called "surrender letters" to criminal aliens asking them to appear at an
INS office before leaving the US, but only four percent of the aliens to whom
such letters are sent respond.  The INS is trying to deport convicted illegal
aliens straight from their jail cells, so that they are not freed from prison,
and then have to be re-located and removed.</tt><p>

<tt>On May 19, it was reported that the 22,000 Nicaraguans whose work permits
have been renewed on a year-to-year basis while their asylum applications are
pending may, contrary to earlier reports, have their work permits renewed once
more.  However, the INS is also likely to speed up the deportation of
Nicaraguans whose asylum applications have been denied.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1990 COP found 74,000 Nicaraguans in Dade County, while local leaders
estimate there are as many as 200,000. The first wave that arrived after the
Sandanistas took power in 1979 were welcomed as refugees from Communism, but
subsequent waves included many poorer and less educated Nicaraguans.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a US policy begun in the early 1980s, Nicaraguans were given work
permits even if their applications for asylum were rejected, and some have now
worked in the US for more than a decade.  On March 1 in Miami, about 1,000 of
the 100,000 Nicaraguans in southern Florida protested an INS policy effective
January 4, 1995 that discontinued the automatic issuance of work permits to
asylum seekers.  Today, work permits are issued to Nicaraguan and other asylum
seekers on a case-by-case basis.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 60,000 Nicaraguans are affected by the ruling; 24,000 applicants
whose cases have not yet been heard, and the rest applicants who are appealing
a denial of asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Nicaraguans say the changes will force them to take illegal jobs or return
to a economically troubled homeland.  In December, 1994, Nicaraguan President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro urged President Clinton to allow the Nicaraguans to
remain in the US longer, because, she said, the Nicaraguan economy could not
handle the return of thousands of Nicaraguans.  Chamorro says that Nicaragua
receives $150 million per year in remittances, although exiles believe
remittances exceed $300 million. </tt><p>
<tt>Nicaragua is a country of four million with a 1992 per capita GDP of $340,
lower than Pakistan and China.  About 200,000 Nicaraguans are believed to have
returned from the US to Nicaragua since 1990.</tt><p>

<tt>The Bilingual Education Act of 1967 required local school districts to
teach subjects such as math and science in the native language of students, at
a cost in federal funds of $226 million in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bilingual education has now come under attack.  In many school districts,
all students with, for example, Hispanic surnames, are tested for English
language proficiency, and those who score in the fortieth percentile or less
are placed in bilingual classes.  Those placed in bilingual programs are
reportedly isolated from other students.</tt><p>
<tt>Many studies conclude that non-English-speaking students taught in English
do better than those taught in their native language.  In the second such study
by a major school district, a New York study concluded that those taught mostly
in English perform better in English and math and science than children taught
subjects such as math and science in their native language, with supplementary
English instruction.  The justification for bilingual education is that, by
teaching non-English speaking children in their mother tongue, they will not
fall behind other students, and will learn English. </tt><p>
<tt>One alternative to bilingual education is English as a Second Language.  In
ESL settings, students take regular classes in math and science, but then take
supplemental intensive instruction in English.  In New York City, over
three-fourths of the non-English speaking children who entered kindergarten in
ESL programs were able to move into regular classes within three years, versus
half of the children in bilingual classes.  Bilingual education costs $7,289
per student per year in New York City, versus $5,149 for regular
classes.</tt><p>
<tt>A reassessment of the overall performance of the US educational system by
Sandia concluded that "America's 'on-time' high school graduation rate has been
steady for over 20 years at roughly 75 percent to 80 percent....[but the]
recent immigration of Hispanics, many of whom come into the US school system
with inadequate background to succeed is significantly inflating dropout
figures for the Hispanic population....some students require more than four
years to complete high school, and many dropouts avail themselves of
opportunities to reenter (GED, night school, etc.), resulting in an overall
high school completion rate for young adults of over 85 percent. This rate is
improving and is among the best in the world." </tt><p>
<tt>Organizations such as the American Legion have attacked bilingual
education, bilingual ballots, and the practice of swearing in new US citizens
in a language other than English.  For example, in 1993, 76 immigrants in
Tucson became US citizens in a ceremony conducted mostly in Spanish.<b> </b> In
California, drivers may take their test in any one of 35 languages, including
Laotian, Farsi, Samoan, Western Armenian, and Tongan.  Federal law requires
that voting materials be printed in the language of any non-English speaking
group of 10,000 or more, or if they are five percent or more, of a voting
district.</tt><p>
<tt>California had a law practically mandating the teaching of "limited English
proficient" (LEP) students in their own language until 1987 but, according to a
recent reports, the state Department of Education has been captured by
administrators and unions that benefit from own-language instruction, so that
the law's requirements persist.  At a December 1994 hearing in Sacramento,
there was widespread opposition from such groups to plans that would permit the
establishment of English immersion programs if the local school board thought
that English immersion was the best way for LEP children to learn.</tt><p>
<tt>California Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin asked the
Board of Education to increase flexibility for districts that want to use more
English-language instruction because educators are becoming convinced that
bilingual education is not the most effective means to teach non-native English
speakers.  Eastin also plans to crackdown on school districts using the
native-language model and not performing well. </tt><p>
<tt>California has 1.2 million LEP students in 500 school districts (of 5.2
million), and spends $300 million annually to educate non-English speakers in
their native languages.  The debate over bilingual education is illustrated by
the response to the Sacramento Bee editorial by William Dawson, the former
acting state superintendent of public instruction in California.  There is
disagreement on the facts:  Dawson asserts that the research shows that using
the students primary language leads to English becoming the main language after
two to three years, but that special services are needed for five to seven
years.  </tt><p>
<tt>English First, the organization that supported Prop. 63 in 1986, opposes
bilingual education.  The 4,300-member California Association for Bilingual
Education (CABE) supports the continuation of bilingual education
programs.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York City, an "immigrant high school" has been proposed to educate
up to 1,000 ninth to twelfth graders in English and native languages who have
been in the US for less than one year.  If approved by the Board of Education,
the new school would offer newcomers up to four years--rather than the usual
one year-- of native language instruction; critics allege that such newcomer
schools institutionalize the isolation of immigrant children, making it hard
for them to make the transition into regular schools.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Italy,
Albania Take Measures to Control Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Every night hundreds of Kurds, Albanians, Yugoslavs, and Chinese are
ferried from Albania across the Adriatic Sea to Italy.  At its closest point,
Albania is 50 miles across the Adriatic Sea from Italy.  Officials estimate
over 50,000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union each year through
Italy's heel.</tt><p>
<tt>The governments of Albania and Italy announced a joint task force on May 27
to deal with the problem of illegal immigration from Albania to Italy.  Italy
has also tighten its border controls.  On May 10, the Italian government moved
1,000 soldiers to the southern Adriatic coast to deter illegal immigrants from
entering the country, and another 500 will be moved into the area during the
summer months.</tt><p>
<tt>After six days at the border, the Italian troops arrested only 30 Turkish
Kurds and one Albanian crossing the Adriatic.  The Kurds were given medical
checks, photographed, and then released and told to leave Italy within 15
days.</tt><p>
<tt>Albania has also assigned 300 troops to stop Albanians from leaving their
homeland.  The Albanian Interior and Defense ministries recently tightened
maritime and land border crossing patrols to prevent the country from being
used as a springboard for illegal immigrants.  In May 1995, Albania turned back
about 500 Turks, Kurds, Pakistanis and Chinese. </tt><p>
<tt>One reason why illegal immigrants aim to enter the EU through Italy is
that, under the 1991 Martelli law, most illegal aliens who are apprehended are
given 15 days to leave the country--only Albanians are expelled immediately. If
caught trying to enter Italy without papers, Albanians are returned on a ferry
that makes the journey between Italy and Albania three times each week.  Italy
does not require visas from former Yugoslav nationals, a violation of an
agreement made by Schengen members in January.</tt><p>
<tt>The Italian foreign minister is considering granting temporary seasonal
visas to Albanians in an effort to reduce illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>An eleven-page report by the Carabinieri, the armed police of the Italian
Interior Ministry, details how Turkish smuggling organizations move Turks into
Europe through Italy.  Turkish migrants enter Italy along the Apulian coast,
having been brought across the Adriatic from Albania. Until it was blocked by
the war in ex-Yugoslavia, the more direct land route through the Balkans was
used. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the current illegal border crossers are Kurds, attracted by the
prospect of jobs in Germany.  They are collected by the smuggling organization
in busses from such Kurdish cities as Eiazig, Bingol, Mes, Palu, Eleskirt,
Varto and Nardin, driven through Bulgaria to Albania, and parceled out to
operators who take them by truck and bus to the harbor cities of Durres and
Vlore, where Italy is only fifty miles away across the Straits of Otranto.
</tt><p>
<tt>From Italian coastal towns, they are taken by train to Milan or Voghera to
San Remo or Ventimiglia, and then taken across the French border to Marseille
and Lyon.  They are then moved from France to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The Carabinieri report says that the smugglers take the Turks' passports at
the start of the journey, so that they can control them more easily, and also
so that the Turks are in better position to claim asylum should they be caught.
Smugglers charge each migrant about $4,300 for the whole trip--$2,100 as far as
Albania, $1,050 for the boat crossing to Italy, another $500 or $600 to get to
France, and the rest for the final push to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The Carabinieri estimate that the smuggling organization has brought more
than 7,000 unauthorized migrants through Italy into France, and has earned
itself some $28 million in that way.  In the first quarter of 1995, the German
border police picked up 435 Turkish citizens attempting illegally to cross the
French and Benelux borders into Germany.  There is no estimate of how many
people may have succeeded. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany's Interior Minister, Manfred Kanther, argued that Italy must police
its borders more effectively.  Kanther has said that Italy is disregarding the
spirit of Schengen by allowing hundreds of illegal immigrants into the EU every
day.  Italy has signed but not implemented the Schengen agreement. </tt><p>
<tt>In Rome, Kanther was contradicted by Christopher Hein, director of the
Italian Refugee Council, who said that the influx of Kurds was a long-range
consequence of the German recruitment of Turkish guest workers in the 1960s.
</tt><p>
<tt>Italy is also facing an influx of illegal Chinese immigrants being smuggled
in by Chinese gangs.  Italian authorities are concerned that the Chinese and
Italian mafias are working together. </tt><p>

<tt>There are 10 to 13 million Muslims in France, Germany, the UK, and the
Netherlands, mostly immigrants and their children from North Africa, Turkey,
and the Indian subcontinent.  According to some observers, there is a marked
difference between the original "guest workers" and their children--the now 50
and older guest workers are trying to stay connected to Islam and their
homelands via satellite TV, while their children adopt the language and values
of their host countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Muslims living in Europe support militant movements to change
governments in their home countries, and in recent years, many have been
arrested for stockpiling weapons.  Many older Muslims who arrived as guest
workers reported that they did not think about their religion, and religious
differences, until settled and they and their children suffered
discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt>Second-generation immigrants suffer high jobless rates--often 50 percent or
more--and some turn to militant Islam because of their failures to obtain
promising jobs.  In other words, unemployment, not Islam, is believed to be at
the root of the appeal of militant Islam.</tt><p>
<tt>Fears of militant Muslims reportedly pervade the thinking of government
officials--NATO in 1995 announced that militant Islam is as much a threat to
Western Europe today as Communism was before 1989.  About 200 militant Muslims
were arrested and expelled from Western Europe in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of Europe's Muslims are in four countries:  France--five million
Muslims in a total population of 57 million, Germany, two million of 81
million, UK,1 million of 58 million, and the Netherlands, 750,000 of 15
million.  In most countries, there are relatively few mosques for these large
Muslim populations.</tt><p>
<tt>France is trying to support the development of what it calls "French
Islam," a secular type of Muslim religion. </tt><p>

<tt>The number of asylum seekers in Germany fell to 8,500 in April 1995, a six
year low.  Some 40,400 foreigners have applied for asylum in Germany so far in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>On April 28, a Schleswig-Holstein court ruled that Kurds facing deportation
from Germany risk persecution in Turkey and should not be sent there.
SPD-governed states or Laender such as North Rhine Westphalia announced that
they would not deport Kurds until at least June 12.  Under German law, the
federal government decides whether a foreigner deserves asylum in Germany, but
it is up to state governments to remove rejected asylum seekers from the
country.</tt><p>
<tt>In early April 1995, virtually all of the EU Parliament deputies voted
against an EU-Turkey customs union to protest the Turkish government's alleged
violation of human rights in its war against PKK Kurdish separatists.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 16 Amnesty International released a report on German police
brutality against foreigners, which concluded that the police do not help
foreigners attacked by Germans, and sometimes are the cause of violence against
foreigners.  There were 70 reports of police brutality against foreigners
reported to police between January 1992 and March 1995.  Amnesty International
called upon federal and regional authorities to prevent police brutality
against foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the cases involved police in Berlin.  Berlin has the
largest Turkish population outside Turkey.  The city also has many Vietnamese
who were brought in during the Communist era and are now regarded as illegal
immigrants; many of those without work permits live by selling smuggled
cigarettes on the streets. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, there were 1,233 xenophobia-grounded violent crimes against non-
Germans in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>German schools report that xenophobic violence is becoming more common on
school grounds--and not just in urban areas.  German authorities report
bombings near schools and drive-by shootings.  In Eppingen, a southern German
town of 18,000, a local 30-member gang of extreme rightist youths stormed a
high school graduation ceremony shouting "Deutschland den Deutschen (Germany
for the Germans)." The gang beat up pupils and teachers and engaged in
vandalism.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC16">British
Immigration Crackdown</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard has proposed new powers for public officials
to investigate claims of suspected illegal immigrants who use public services,
such as health and housing.  The proposals would allow the Home Office's
Immigration and Nationality Department to reveal confidential details of
immigration cases to other officials.  Government departments and local
authority staff would be encouraged to exchange information with immigration
officials routinely.</tt><p>
<tt>Another proposal by the Social Security Secretary would detain thousands of
asylum seekers in camps and cut welfare benefits while claims are being
considered.  The plan would also speed up the asylum process.  Similar camps
have been set up in Holland, Germany, Norway and Spain.  The British Home
Office has expressed concern about whether there would be a cost savings.  Most
asylum cases take about 32 weeks to process and there is a backlog of 55,000
cases. </tt><p>
<tt>A bill to make it illegal to employ undocumented immigrants was passed by
the House of Commons with a majority of nine votes.  Although not expected to
become law, there is speculation that Howard will introduce a similar measure
in his package of immigration reforms in the next Queen's Speech.  In Britain,
it is illegal to harbor illegal immigrants, but it is not illegal to employ
them. </tt><p>
<tt>Howard is determined to close loopholes in UK immigration laws and to
streamline the procedures for dealing with asylum-seekers.  About 80 percent of
all asylum applications are rejected -and 80 per cent of appeals are also
turned down.  </tt><p>
<tt>The majority of the 34,000 asylum applications since 1994 are not genuine,
according to the Home Office, which is drawing up procedures to decide more
quickly which applications are without merit.  Howard is reviewing the extent
to which asylum-seekers should continue to obtain welfare benefits while their
appeals are pending.  New and tougher penalties for the smugglers of illegal
immigrants are also being considered.</tt><p>

<tt>Immigration played an important role in the closing days of the French
presidential election held on May 7, 1995, which was won by Paris Mayor Jacques
Chirac with 53 percent of the vote.  On May 1, a Moroccan immigrant was drowned
when a French skinhead pushed him into the Seine river during a rally of Le
Pen's National Front.  According to the National Front, the suspect was not a
member, but was there to sabotage the demonstration.</tt><p>
<tt>Both candidates criticized Le Pen for not condemning the drowning, and both
paid homage to him as a victim of racism and xenophobia.  Both took strong
stands against illegal immigration, and Chirac urged more foreign aid for
Africa to prevent African immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Both candidates promised to work harder to curb illegal immigration, and
Chirac has promised to enforce aggressively the 1993 Pasqua laws enacted to
make it more difficult to immigrate to France.  These laws permit random police
checks of persons to determine whether they are illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Chirac announced that reducing France's 12 percent unemployment rate was
his top priority, and proposed a $400 monthly subsidy for two years to
employers who hire a worker who has been unemployed 12 months or more.
Employers would also be exempt from payroll taxes on such hires.</tt><p>
<tt>The French economy is expected to grow three percent in 1995, inflation is
low, and France is the world's fourth leading exporter, but there are great
concerns about persons "excluded" from French growth, including foreigners.

<tt>Migrants from ex-Soviet states and the Third World are continuing to enter
Russia.  Since 1994, about 2.5 million people have moved to Russia from the
former Soviet states, according to the Russian Federal Migration Service.
Russia's Center for Economic Affairs estimates that by the year 2000, there
will be a net migration of 2.8 million people from the former Soviet republics
into Russia. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the migrants are Russians from Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and
Uzbekistan, but the influx from Kazakhstan is increasing.  Within Russia, the
conflict in the Caucasus has produced some 300,000 internal refugees, and a
further 320,000 have fled the war in Chechnya.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the migrants from the Third World in Russia are in transit to the
West.  The FMS estimates the number of such migrants at 500,000, mostly from
Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Iran,  Sudan, Angola, Pakistan
and Nigeria, and mostly awaiting a turn to go west in Moscow.</tt><p>
<tt>"Operation Foreigner," a Russian program to rid the country of illegal
Chinese immigrants, has been in effect for over one year and, according to
Russian officials, has been successful. Operation Foreigner includes more
border guards at the Chinese frontier, and closer scrutiny of documents.

<tt>In some border towns, Chinese workers have both Russian and Chinese
documents, and the influx of Chinese is blamed in part on lax tourist controls.

</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a></a>Maids</a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>There are between one million and 1.7 million women employed as foreign
maids throughout Asia and Middle East.  </tt><p>
<tt>The largest number are employed in Saudi Arabia, according to a 1992
survey.  Hong Kong and Singapore each had about 65,000 maids, and  Bahrain had
40,000 maids.  The Philippines was the largest source of maids--at least
275,000 Filipinas work overseas.  The next largest exporters of maids were Sri
Lanka and Indonesia, each with about 100,000 women abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>Maids go to the Middle East because of the high wages, but there is
widespread agreement that working conditions are harsh.  Hong Kong pays three
times the wages of Singapore.  Canada was previously a popular country because
Canada granted permanent residence to maid caregivers after two years' of
employment.  Canada halted that policy in 1991, but foreign workers are allowed
to marry or change their employment.  </tt><p>
<tt>In Singapore, the number of foreign maids rose from about 5,000 in 1978 to
40,000 ten years later.  Since 1988, the number of maids has doubled again to
more than 80,000; the sharp rise is seen in data that indicate that in 1990,
the Singapore Census found that only two percent of the households relied on
foreign maids to care for children.</tt><p>
<tt>Today, one out of every ten households in Singapore has a maid.  About
three-quarters of Singapore's maids are from the Philippines; the rest are from
Indonesia, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign maids first started going the Singapore in the 1930s when the
so-called amahs arrived from China and Malaysia.  The amahs belonged to a
sisterhood, called kongsi, which believed in spinsterhood and female
independence.  This organization provided them lodging, helped in recruitment
and negotiated working conditions.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the 1970s, the Singapore government began to allow more foreign maids
from the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka to be employed because of the
shrinking supply of amahs and local maids.  In 1989, the government gave
married working women an income tax deduction for the wages they paid to a
foreign maid.  As the number of foreign maids grew, the government implemented
a levy on foreign maids.  Today, Singaporeans wishing to bring in foreign
domestic workers must pay a monthly fee of $US 235 to the government.</tt><p>
<tt>In June, 1995, some 50,000 Sri Lankan, Indian and Bangladeshi women are
expected to move to Singapore to replace Filipino maids.  There is some concern
that cultural differences between the South Asian and Singaporeans will create
problems that did not arise with the English-speaking Filipinas. </tt><p>
<tt>More than 60,000 Filipina maids continue to work in Singapore, despite
three planeloads of their compatriots returning home under following the
dispute over the hanging of a Filipina maid (Migration News, May 1995). </tt><p>
<tt>Philippine President Ramos has called a special legislative session to
develop a Magna Carta for Philippine nationals working abroad.  The Philippine
Department of Labor and Employment has developed proposals to prevent another
Philippine national from being hanged without a complete investigation by
increasing the number of Philippine Labor attaches, adding legal attaches and
military and policy attaches abroad to aid Filipinos victimized by unfair labor
practices. </tt><p>
<tt>The human rights organization Kalayaan called for the UK to change its laws
to protect 20,000 foreign domestic servants in the UK.  British law allows
employers to bring domestic workers into the country, but does not grant them
an independent immigration status, which means they must stay with their
original employer.  Many of the UK's foreign workers are Filipino. </tt><p>
<tt>The Trade Union without Borders helps domestic workers in Geneva, where
there are about 2800 foreign maids.  The union asserts that there are many of
abuse and exploitation of these maids. </tt><p>

<tt>On Sunday evenings thousands of Indians and Bangladeshis descend upon
vacant lots in the City Center of Singapore to talk with friends.  About 30,000
Indians and Bangladeshis work in the shipyard and construction industries of
Singapore.  Residents who live in the nearby area worry about their safety, but
are resigned to the use of vacant lots as gathering places for foreign workers.
</tt><p>
<tt>In another part of town called Little Thailand, the 40,000 Thai workers
have similar gatherings.  The 60,000 Filipino maids gather at the mass transit
stations on the weekends.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners account for more than 300,000 of Singapore's 1.6 million
workers.  Foreign worker quotas were raised in 1994 in the manufacturing,
service, and shipbuilding sectors.  </tt><p>
<tt>On April 1, 1995<b> </b>the foreign worker levy was raised by 10 per cent
to prevent an influx of low-wage foreign workers.  Government officials hope
that these foreign worker policies will prevent the settlement of foreign
workers, and discourage local employers from becoming dependent on foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore Minister for Home Affairs told employers that they should not
rely upon workers from only a small number of countries, such as Malaysia and
the Philippines.  He suggested India, Burma and Vietnam as possible new sources
of labor.  </tt><p>

<tt>The Taiwan Council of Labor Affairs started accepting applications from
employers for 8,200 foreign workers.  The workers will come from Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and possibly Fiji.  The council will allow a
maximum of 35 percent of a company's work force to be foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The workers will be allocated under quotas to industries, such as fabric
and sock weaving, sweater producers, electroplating, pigments, machinery
molding plants, and producers of stone products. </tt><p>
<tt>Individual companies will no longer be allowed to employ foreign workers
privately; all foreign workers will be admitted under government contracts.
The government will control the number of foreign workers in Taiwan and will
set a ceiling of five percent of the Taiwanese work force, or a maximum
460,000.  The CLA has issued permits for 250,000 foreign workers, which means
that Taiwanese employers will be permitted to bring in another 190,000 foreign
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently about 169,000 foreign workers and 8,800 domestic
helpers in Taiwan.  They earned about US $600 per month. </tt><p>
<tt>The police said 9,333 foreign workers brought into Taiwan had run away from
their legal employers as of the end of March, 1995.  But only 3,144 of them
have been found and deported.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Malaysia's booming economy has drawn more than a million migrants from
Indonesia, the Philippines and Bangladesh, among others, in search of
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>By one estimate, if economic and job growth continue at current rates--the
government projects economic growth of seven percent per year to 2020--
Malaysia will need 23 million workers in 2020, but will have only 13 million
workers.  Malaysia currently has a per capita GDP of $3200.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite promises by Malaysia's Prime Minister to permit industrial wages to
rise, and to reduce the country's reliance on foreign workers, the government
is considering extending the work permits for foreign workers.  The Malaysian
Department of Human Resources proposed a 3+2 formula which would allow work
permits for foreign workers to be extended for two years upon the request of an
employer.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers are currently given two-year work permits, with the
employer having the option of extending the permit for one year.  Employers
have ask the Malaysian government to permit another two year extension so that
they can keep trained workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is considering imposing stiffer fines on recruitment agencies who
employ foreign workers in illegal activities.  Some of the proposed penalties
include higher fines, jail and caning.  A bill with the proposed changes is
expected to be submitted by the Attorney General's office before the end of
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian authorities arrested over 3,000 illegal Indonesian migrants in
just two months, mostly in the provinces of Johor, Selangor, Melaka and Negri
Sembilan.  Many of the illegal immigrants are arriving by boat.  Those caught
are held temporarily in one of five immigration detention camps. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1992, the government licensed about 300,000 illegals from these camps
for temporary employment in households, plantations and the construction
industry to ease the acute labor shortage in these areas.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is considered an economic success story, but there continue to be
concerns about the country's treatment of unions.  The Malaysian electronics
industry employs 140,000 workers, including 120,000 women, but labor law bans
unions from this "pioneer" industry in which the government hopes to lure
foreign investment.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most electronics workers are young women who start on the assembly line at
age 17 to 25, and stay for less than 10 years, earning $140 to $250 per month.
A Spring 1993 survey reported that electronics workers were 75 percent female,
63 percent Malay, and 57 percent skilled.  </tt><p>
<tt>Skilled workers were paid an average $1.15 per hour or $221 per month,
including benefits.  Unskilled workers were paid an average $133
monthly.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government reports that fewer Malaysians are settling in
Australia.  Between 1984 to 1994 over 40,000 Malaysian, 16 percent of all
settlers from Southeast Asia, settled in Australia.  Malaysia was the third
largest source of settlers after Vietnam and the Philippines. </tt><p>

<tt>The Philippines, sometimes called "the sick man of Asia", grew by 5.1
percent in 1994, giving the country a GDP of about $50 billion, and exports of
$12 billion.  Foreigners promised to invest $2.5 billion in the Philippines in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Earlier in 1995, there were fears that the Philippine bubble would burst,
as did Mexico's because so much of the foreign money coming into the country is
portfolio investment in stocks and bonds.  The Ramos government reportedly
killed two birds with one stone by permitting competition in the telephone
industry--reducing the power of the local oligarchy, and lowering costs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines, with 68 million people, has one of the fastest population
growth rates in Asia, about 2.2 percent, versus 1.4 percent in Thailand, which
has 60 million residents. But the Catholic church in the Philippines--85
percent of Filipinos are Catholics--insists that there be no governmental
support for birth control. </tt><p>
<tt>President Fidel Ramos called the Philippine Congress into a special
one-week session from May 21 to 28 to approve measures to protect overseas
workers.  The government is also calling on the Philippine Senate to approve an
international convention to protect the rights of migrant workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Philippine overseas workers declined by 2.5 percent in the
first quarter of 1995 compared to the same period last year.  The Middle East
remained the primary destination of overseas workers with 48 percent, while 36
percent went to other Asian countries. </tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 100,000 illegal aliens in the Philippines will be offered
amnesty under a new program.  Under the Alien Social Integration Act of 1995,
foreigners who entered the Philippines before June 20, 1993 can apply for legal
status.  The amnesty program runs from June 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996.
Illegal aliens with pending criminal cases and refugees can not apply under the
program. </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines government announced that it will also closely monitor
foreign students after police officials said that some were linked to
international terrorist groups.  The police will verify the identities of all
foreign students and identify any who have overstayed their visas.</tt><p>

<tt>Over the weekend of May 20-21, 1995, several thousand Vietnamese boat
people rioted while being transferred from one camp to another in Hong Kong,
leaving 200 Hong Kong police and Vietnamese hurt.</tt><p>
<tt>The cause of the riot was ostensibly a bill in the US House of
Representatives that provides $30 million to resettle in the US about half of
the 40,000 Vietnamese boat people being held in detention camps through out
Asia.  </tt><p>
<tt>The bill, proposed by Republicans and opposed by the Clinton
administration, would permit the money only to be spent on resettling these
Vietnamese in the US, thereby overturning the US and international policy-known
as the Comprehensive Plan of Action-- of returning to Vietnam those who remain
in camps throughout Asia by the end of 1995.  If approved, the bill would end
US contributions to the UN program that has since 1990 returned to Vietnam
persons found to be economic migrants.  A vote on the bill is scheduled for
June.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 21,000 Vietnamese in camps in Hong Kong, and UNHCR
officials there expressed fear that, as the House proposal becomes known in the
camps, few Vietnamese will return to Vietnam voluntarily, and more may leave
Vietnam in small boats.  In 1994, a false rumor that Japan was accepting
Vietnamese boat people prompted more than 1,000 Vietnamese to sail for that
country.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN and the Hong Kong government started an information campaign shortly
after word of the US proposals began to filter through the detention camps,
emphasizing that that no US law has been enacted that will reverse the decision
to return them to Vietnam.  But some believed that, with powerful champions in
Congress, they should resist returning to Vietnam in the hope that the bill may
yet be enacted.  </tt><p>
<tt>On April 30, 1975, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh city) fell to North Vietnamese
troops.  Some 1.2 million southeast Asians eventually left their countries of
origin, and most were resettled in the US.  There are over southeast Asians in
California, and about 60 percent are on public assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>As Americans re-debated whether the US should have fought in Vietnam, there
were remarkably few reflections on how the southeast Asians are faring in the
US and California.  Most profiles stressed the success stories--the children of
refugees who are valedictorians in high school and the success of refugees in
business, including the Cambodians, who dominate California's donut business.
A few profiles emphasized the welfare dependency of Southeast Asians in
California, and the tendency of youth gangs to break into homes of recent
arrivals and rob those unlikely to complain to police.</tt><p>

<tt>Bangladeshi troops have been ordered by the government to shoot-on-sight
any "illegally entered foreigners" who violate the night curfew along the 2,590
mile-border with India.  Bangladeshi officials say the shoot-on-sight order is
necessary to stop smuggling of illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>News reports said that those entering Bangladesh were being "pushed" out of
India by Indian authorities on the grounds that they were illegal
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Almost two million Bangladeshis are believed to have migrated to the
northeastern Indian state of Assam over the past 20 years, and clashes between
natives and immigrants have killed 7,000 since the 1980s.  Instead of cracking
down on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, India is now emphasizing the need to
reduce emigration pressures from the world's most densely population
nation--there are 2,200 people per square mile in Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>Indian estimates are that 15 million former East Pakistanis and
Bangladeshis--some of whom were Hindu--have settled in India since 1947.</tt><p>
<tt>Karachi, Pakistan is a vast city spread over 30 miles of semi-desert area,
whose population has been increasing by six percent per year.  Police in
Karachi estimate that up to 20 percent of the city's 10 million residents are
illegal aliens.  An estimated 1.2 million are Bangladeshis, followed by 200,000
Burmese, and 84,000 Afghans.  </tt><p>
<tt>Each wave of immigrants allegedly adds another slum to the city.  According
to Pakistani officials, illegal migrants cause crime and take jobs away from
Pakistanis.  Pakistan has been unable to deport illegal Bangladeshis, because
Bangladesh does not take back citizens who have left the country illegally.
</tt><p>
<tt>Pakistani employers reportedly prefer to hire the illegal workers because
they are willing to work for lower wages.  Pakistani police recommend a
legalization program, and then a 1000 rupee-- $33--charge for a work permit.
Some human rights lawyers do not want the Pakistani police to have any role in
immigration, since they allege that the police are responsible for extorting
bribes from immigrants.  Instead, they call for better border controls.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 12, the provincial government of Karachi cracked down on illegal
aliens and arrested several hundred.  The Pakistan government blames much of
the terrorism in the port city on illegal immigrants, primarily muhajirs, who
are Urdu-speaking migrants from India and their descendants. </tt><p>
<tt>Pakistan's economy grew by four percent in 1994, and foreign direct
investment topped $300 million, but it remains one of the world's largest poor
countries--GDP per capita was just $420 in 1992, versus $310 in neighboring
India.</tt><p>

<tt>At a May 22 Israeli cabinet meeting, several ministers demanded that the
government limit the country's increasing dependence on foreign guest workers.
On the same day, the Interior Minister expelled 14 illegally employed Thai and
Filipino workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs asked the government to stop labor
brokers or manpower companies from importing foreign guest workers.  The
minister said that the agencies are responsible for deteriorating working
conditions of foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Israel is slowing reopening its borders to Palestinian workers after two
year of restrictions following a wave of terrorist attacks.  There are now over
30,000 Palestinian workers permitted to cross the border daily; half are
agricultural workers, and the rest construction workers.  There were about
100,000 Palestinians workers in Israel before the borders were closed following
terrorist attacks two years ago. </tt><p>
<tt>Israel in 1995 accelerated the substitution of Asian and European workers
for Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, importing 70,000 foreign workers
from Romania, Thailand, Ghana, and Turkey since 1993.  In some cases,
Palestinians are being asked to train other foreign workers, who usually earn
the minimum wage of about $2 per hour.  Some Israeli employers prefer Asian and
European unskilled workers because they reportedly have little knowledge of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.</tt><p>
<tt>Israeli and Palestinian officials in March 1995 began negotiations on the
possible repatriation of Palestinians who left what is today Israel, the West
Bank, and Gaza.  Some 600,000 to 800,000 Palestinians are believed to have left
what is today Israel in 1948, and another 220,000 to 330,000 left the West Bank
and Gaza in 1967.  Today, there may be as many as three million Palestinian
refugees and their children.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about three million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza
today, and all sides agree that the economy there cannot support immigration.
However, Palestinian officials are committed to the gradual and unconditional
return of all refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>US officials are calling on Israel to find short-term solutions to
alleviate Palestine unemployment, which is 60 percent in Gaza.  Palestinian
economists estimate that Palestinian workers lose $1 million each day that
Israel closes the border.  Israel plans to announce a series of public works
programs inside the Palestinian Authority.</tt><p>

<tt>The Saudi government plans to offer amnesty to an estimated 500,000 illegal
immigrants in the country.  Most are Moslems who entered Saudi Arabia on
pilgrims' visas, often with no intention of returning home.  Since January
1995, Saudi Arabia deported over 5,000 Indians who overstayed their pilgrims'
visas.  Earlier in the year, Saudi officials deported one thousand Bangladeshi
and Pakistanis who had overstayed their visas. </tt><p>
<tt>Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gives Moslems who want to go to Saudi
Arabia on pilgrimages only exit visas.</tt><p>
<tt>There is very little crime committed by foreigners despite the fact that
most are young men separated from their families--an average 150 per year have
been arrested in 1993-94.  However, Saudis complain that Catholic nannies pass
on their religion to the children in their care; that the abundance of foreign
workers tends to make Saudis think that they deserve to manage others, leading
to an excess of middle managers; and that the availability of foreign workers
deters the entrance of women into the economy and labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>Saudis consider many of these illegal immigrants to be fortune hunters who
simply want to make as much money as soon as possible, rather than learn Arabic
and Saudi culture.  The five million immigrants among the 12 million residents
of Saudi Arabia remit an estimated $4 billion annually to their countries of
origin.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC33">Urban
Institute Workshop on Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></h2>
<tt>As Congress and the administration step up their efforts to reduce illegal
immigration, and consider proposals to reduce legal immigration and to restrict
the access of legal immigrants to welfare, agricultural employers prepared to
make another push for a guest worker program.  Some feel that guest workers are
the natural second-best option for very divergent interests unable to get what
they really want.  For example, ex-President Salinas of Mexico and California
Governor Wilson agree on little else about immigration other than that guest
workers are preferred to the status quo.</tt><p>
<tt>The Urban Institute on May 23 held a workshop entitled "Guest Workers:  New
Solutions or New Problems?"  A new Urban Institute Working Paper notes that all
of the OECD countries, plus many others, have programs that aim to add workers
to the labor force, but not settled residents to the population.  However, in
every case, the results are the same, best expressed in the aphorism that there
is nothing more permanent than temporary workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The usual rationale for guest worker programs is economic--admit foreign
workers to fill labor shortages and thereby obtain the mutual benefits of more
production and economic activity in the labor-importing country, while
providing jobs and wages for the emigration country.</tt><p>
<tt>However, dependence and distortion are everywhere associated with guest
workers.  These terms refer to the fact that some guest workers settle, that
employers assume that foreign workers will continue to be available, and that
foreign jobs will continue to be available.  These factors combine to create
powerful migration networks that make immigration control a more difficult
objective to achieve.</tt><p>
<tt>The Urban Institute Working Paper emphasized that the rationale for guest
worker programs is changing.  During the 1960s, for example, guest workers were
practically synonymous with thousands of Turks and Algerians arriving every day
in Germany and France to fill macro or economy-wide labor shortages during
periods when the unemployment rate was less than one percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Today, guest workers are imported to herd sheep in the American west, pour
drinks in mountain resorts, and be physical therapists--these foreign workers
are usually filling very specific labor shortages in labor markets with high
unemployment.  </tt><p>
<tt>The instruments needed by governments to fill such precise labor
shortages--active and credible employment services and control over illegal
immigration--are often lacking, making the determination over whether guest
workers are needed an increasingly contentious issue.</tt><p>
<tt>After the government certifies that foreign workers are needed to fill
vacant jobs, employers may be free to recruit in any country and under any
circumstances that they want, or they may be required to take the workers
arranged by the ES in particular countries.  </tt><p>
<tt>The third and most debated aspect of guest worker programs is how to avoid
employer dependence and worker settlement.  Governments in East Asia are trying
to avoid what they see as the mistakes made in Europe and North America by
levying taxes or fees on employers who hire foreign workers, and requiring some
of the foreign workers' earnings to be put into government savings accounts.
If workers do not claim these wages in their country of origin at the end of
their contracts, the wages are forfeited.</tt><p>
<tt>The mostly western growers proposal for a 1995 guest worker program for US
agriculture makes major changes to the current program under which foreign
workers are permitted to be admitted for temporary US farm jobs.  About 3,000
US farm employers bring 17,000 so-called H-2A alien farm workers to the US each
year, so that legal temporary foreigners are less than one percent of the
nation's 2.5 million hired farm workers.</tt><p>
<tt>But about two-thirds of all farm workers in surveys are foreign born, and
about 25 percent are unauthorized, up sharply from less than 10 percent
authorized in 1990.  Farmers argue that if Congressional plans to reduce
illegal immigration are successful, and because many farm workers want to find
other jobs, then agriculture will face escalating labor shortages as
immigration control efforts become more effective.</tt><p>
<tt>Farmers fearful that the US Department of Labor may not agree that they
need foreign workers want to bypass DOL and substitute an attestation procedure
for the current certification procedure.  Under their proposal, farm employers
would certify that they recruited and failed to find US workers while offering
prevailing wages etc, and the DOL would be required to agree unless it could
show that the farm employer was lying.  Farmers would then make individual
agreements with foreign workers that would not be subject to government
scrutiny unless there were complaints.</tt><p>
<tt>Farm worker advocates attacked this proposal, charging that it undoes a
half century of regulations that were established to prevent the exploitation
of US and foreign farm workers.  The growers' plan is scheduled to be
introduced May 26 during the mark up of the Kennedy-Simpson immigration reform
proposal; both Kennedy and Simpson oppose the growers' proposal.</tt><p>
<tt>A second paper on the economic crisis in Mexico and trends in Mexico-US
migration argued that the current migration hump-- the temporary increase in
migration being experienced in 1995--was a predictable result of Mexico-US
economic integration under NAFTA.  The major reasons for the migration hump
include the fact that, despite NAFTA, there continued to be a demand-pull of US
jobs that attract Mexican migrants, NAFTA-inspired restructuring in Mexico
increased supply-push pressures, and well-established networks efficiently move
migrants across borders.</tt><p>
<tt>NAFTA also spurred long-term foreign direct investment in Mexico, but FDI
takes time to create jobs that deter migration.  An overvalued peso throughout
1994, the NAFTA "hope factor" that made devaluation unnecessary, and the
Chiapas uprising and several assassinations provided no opportunity for an
orderly or gradual devaluation.  Instead, a massive devaluation occurred on
December 20, 1994, and a US led international bailout was required to stabilize
Mexico's economy.</tt><p>
<tt>The peso devaluation is certain to stimulate Mexico to US migration in
1995--the only question is how much.  According to most analyses, at the
margin, there is a 1 to 0.7 relationship, i.e., a one percent peso devaluation
increases Mexico-US migration by seven-tenths of one percent. </tt><p>
<tt>In order to reduce Mexico-US migration, the US could step up border
enforcement, try to channel illegal migrants into a guest worker program, or
persuade Mexico to prevent or deter exits.  The paper concludes that none of
these short-run measures is likely to provide a quick fix, and that the US
would be best off if it supported Mexico in pursuing the long-run policies that
are necessary to deter emigration, viz, stick to stable macro policies,
implement political reforms, and develop Mexico's human and physical
infrastructure.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC34">Immigration
in the Americas</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The North-South Center at the University of Miami held a workshop May 19-20
on International Migration and Immigration Policy in the Americas to explore
the current dimensions and reactions to migration.</tt><p>
<tt>Participants were reminded that, despite polls suggesting that the fear of
mass immigration is now equal to the fear of the spread of nuclear weapons--72
percent of those polled put these threats at the top of their list-- US doors
to immigrants, non immigrants, and unauthorized entrants remains open.  Every
day, about 2,500 legal immigrants arrive, as do 60,000 non immigrants, and
about 1,000 unauthorized aliens settle here.</tt><p>
<tt>The year 1994 was the year that the Clinton administration took actions to
deal with immigration issues, and 1995 is shaping up to be a year of
Congressional action on immigration.  In 1994, the Clinton administration
announced reforms that deny work authorization to asylum applicants, stepped up
border control efforts in Texas, Arizona, and California, and changed migration
policy on Haiti and Cuba several times.  In the case of Haiti, it was noted
that some Haitians assert that their country is the only Caribbean nation that
"must" remain democratic so that Haitian migrants have no claim to US
asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration bills are working their ways through both houses of Congress.
The bills most likely to be enacted in 1995 would deal with illegal immigration
by experimenting with new systems through which newly-hired workers prove to
their employers that they are authorized to work in the US.  The debate over
internal enforcement, it was agreed, is whether emphasis should be placed on a
data base against which employers can check worker numbers, whether the
emphasis should be on a secure card for all workers, or whether emphasis should
be placed on stepped-up workplace enforcement.</tt><p>
<tt>There was extensive discussion at the conference about why the US seems
poised to reduce legal and illegal immigration.  Some argued that the
anti-immigrant mood represents another period of nativism, defined by historian
John Higham as a combination of nationalism and ethnic prejudice.  But it was
also noted that there are powerful forces operating at individual, family, and
village levels, as well as in emigration countries and in some sectors of the
US economy, that will make it very difficult to enact and enforce effective
immigration controls.</tt><p>
<tt>One in-between outcome of an effort to reduce immigration when there are
strong forces that want it to continue is to acknowledge inevitable migration,
but seek to regulate it in a manner that does not lead to settlement.  This is
the definition of a guest worker program, and several participants thought that
the US may develop different policies for different countries--virtually
stopping e.g., Haitian immigration, because it is not an economic necessity,
but trying to manage Mexican migration with a guest worker program.</tt><p>
<tt>The conference addressed both south-to-north flows of people within the
Americas as well as global migration flows.  It was noted that there is an
alphabet soup of international organizations to deal with the one-sixth of the
world's GDP that flows across borders in the form of trade, but few
international organizations to deal with the two percent of the world's
population that flows across borders.  </tt><p>
<tt>There was considerable discussion of why states should give up power to one
or more international organizations to deal with migration.  In contrast to
trade organizations, for example, there is no theory or consensus that
countries should be open to immigrants, but there is a theory that countries
will grow faster if they are open to trade in goods.  </tt><p>
<tt>Second, it is widely recognized that freeing up trade creates winners and
losers, so that states often willingly give up power to international
organizations, and put the blame for free trade or tight money decisions on the
World Bank or the WTO.  Immigration also creates winners and losers, but there
is less agreement that states should turn at least some migration control over
to international organizations to help them to deal with domestic winners and
losers in the wake of immigration reforms.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, it is widely recognized that trade channels tend to narrow over time
as special interests attempt to erect barriers to trade, so international
organizations that regulate trade matters look skeptically at the attempts of
countries to interfere with the free flow of goods.  Migration channels, by
contrast, can widen over time as networks are set in motion, so that an
international organization might be forced to play dual roles, justifying
restrictions in countries that want to limit immigration, and justifying the
lowering of migration barriers on behalf of countries that want to increase
labor exports.</tt><p>
<tt>National attitudes toward migration have evolved since the mercantilist
era, when especially skilled craftsmen were hoarded and emigration was
discouraged.  In the 19th century, emigration became a safety valve for
industrializing European societies.</tt><p>
<tt>Many other topics were raised in the free-flowing discussion.  For example,
just how much of the "immigrant problem" in industrial democracies is created
by these rich countries recruiting cheap labor, or sending capital abroad that
disrupts traditional production relationships and thereby sets migration in
motion?  What does it mean to be a member of more open and diverse societies
such as the US, and how easy should the US make naturalization?  </tt><p>
<tt>The current immigrant wave raises doubts about whether the US will be able
to successfully integrate the diverse newcomers arriving today.  The same fears
were raised at the beginning of the century, and it was argued that the key to
integration is the second generation, an issue on which there are signs for
optimism and pessimism.</tt><p>
<tt>Most authors concluded that there is a permanence in the migration they
studied, whether Salvadorans in Long Island, or Colombians in Venezuela.  In
each case, a long period in a richer country leads to permanent settlement for
a significant fraction of the immigrants.</tt><p>
