<PRE>Dear Andy,

Thank you for the book , membership in IGA is great!I get to talk with you
concerning my many garden problems. Now I have a lawn that needs your help!
I never paid much attention to my lawn until it started to look bad and wouldnt grow
as well as my neighbors lawn did. So I asked what they did and I went out and
bought 40 lbs of weed and feed stuff that I could find at my local nursery.
Well, the stuff smelled awful! On the way home I nearly died! After reading the
ingridents and talking with the local dept of agri agent as well as talking tp my
local gardern center sales person, who all told me it was perfectly save to use.
So I went a head and applied it to my lawn.
 a few things happened right after that....
1....I became ill for about two weeks. Doctor said I had a mild case of a 24 hr flue.
2...My cats became ill and would not eat their food. This lasted for about 4 days.
Then they were allright after that.
3...My children, especially my liitle girl, developed at first a  nose drip then developed
into a flue like systoms.
4...My dog also refused to eat for about a few days then she would eat ok after that.
After about 2 months after I applied the weed and feed, the symptoms disappeared.
 No one connected it to the weed and feed application. That it until I applied the stuff
again in another two months( the directions said to apply every 4 months).

The same thing happened again only worse! My illness lasted several months and I still
have'nt fully recovered. My little girl was tested (they did a spinal tap) and was found not
to have lukimia as they had sespected. They they don't know what what they main cause
 except they sespect it to be caused by some toxin in the environment(hint..weed and feed?
and my dog has died of some type of liver illness since thge last application(my dog died
 within 24 hrs of my last application!).

I went to a famous doctor to test us out. He descovered that we were being attacked by several
toxins in our environment and suggested that I get your book "Natural Pest Control" that
it would help me to find natural alternatives to these chemicals. I have also told him of the
weed and feed applications (only after he had asked me about what chemicals I have been
using in my home and garden). He found that I was also using some rather deadly
combinations of home products.

I have since getting your book, stop applying any type of chemical in my home and garden.
With your help my garden is green and safe and my family is enjoying good health as
well!

yours Truly
