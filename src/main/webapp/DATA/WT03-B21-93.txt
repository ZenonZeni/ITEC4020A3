Conceptus is dedicated to addressing the serious needs in reproductive medicine that affect so many patients today. Our initial focus is on improving the diagnosis and treatment of fallopian tube disorders, a major cause of female infertility.

In the last twenty years, there has been an increase in the number of couples diagnosed as infertile, and fallopian tube disorders are implicated in over 35% of these cases. Many of the life style changes of the last two decades are thought to be at least partially responsible for increasing rates of infertility. The tendency for women to defer childbearing in order to establish careers outside the home, for example, has contributed to increasing rates of female infertility because a women at 35 is statistically three times as likely to be infertile as a women of 25.
<P>
Due to the anatomical position of the fallopian tubes, accessing the tubes in order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment has been difficult and often necessitated invasive surgical techniques. Recently, tremendous strides have been made in the development of device technology that allows non-surgical access to remote areas of the body, facilitating less-invasive diagnosis and treatment. Devices, such as micro-catheters and small telescopes, are commonly used in cardiology, gastrointestinal, peripheral vascular and neuro procedures. Many of us at Conceptus were a part of this dramatic change in the way medicine is practiced and we want to see the same patient benefits brought to reproductive medicine. 
<P>
Conceptus’ mission is to bring this proven medical device technology to reproductive medicine, develop technology where it doesn’t exist , and modify and optimize existing technologies for routine use in identifying and treating common reproductive disorders.
<P>
The Company has developed proprietary micro-catheters, smaller than the lead in a pencil, and tiny guidewire systems to allow physicians the ability to access and navigate the proximal end of the fallopian tube (near the uterus) in a non-surgical approach. These devices are inserted through the natural opening of the vagina, into the cervical canal and across the uterus to enter the tubal opening. We believe that our fallopian tube access system facilitates a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of tubal diseases and disorders than conventional diagnostic methods, which are known to be inaccurate. More importantly, we believe that a more accurate  diagnosis will lead to more appropriate infertility therapy, providing the patient with a better result. Our first catheter system for fallopian tube catheterization was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States in 1995. Data from physicians performing tubal catheterization procedures using our catheter system indicate many patients can be spared the trauma and expense of more invasive surgical procedures such as tubal surgery and/or in-vitro fertilization.
<P>
We at Conceptus are also excited about the potential application currently under investigation of our tubal access catheters and other related devices to perform a non-surgical, permanent contraception procedure to replace surgical tubal ligation, the most common form of "birth control."  Stay tuned as we evolve the applications of our unique catheter access products and develop new technologies to expand your options in reproductive medicine.
