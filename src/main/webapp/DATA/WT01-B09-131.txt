<B>Project Title:  Distributed Energy Management System Development and Demonstration<p>
Performing Organization:  Delco Electronics Power Control Systems</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Chris Lawler  (310) 517-6915 (phone)  (310) 517-6721 (fax)</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>Heavy duty electric vehicles, such as buses, contain multiple strings of Description 	parallel battery packs that charge at different rates due to inherent imbalances between the individual battery modules.  High power charging is also becoming a prevalent need by heavy-duty electric vehicle which compounds the charging problem.  To address the problem associated with charging multiple battery packs comprised of batteries of varying capacity and temperature, Delco Electronics Power Control Systems (DEPCS) will develop, test, and demonstrate an effective multi-pack, energy management system.  To properly compensate for all the variation within a pack and between multiple packs requires a system that monitors individual battery module temperature and voltage, and compensates for the capacity variations through charging equalization.  The proposed DEPCS Distributed Energy management System (DEMS) will incorporate individual battery voltage and temperature monitoring and equalization capability using a system of interconnected distributive modules.  The distributive modules are managed through a battery pack controller, which provides total system  control.  Westinghouse, Bluebird, and GNB will all be active participants in this program with DEPCS.</P>


<P><B>Milestones</B></P>	

<P>Delco Electronics Power Control Systems will develop, fabricate, and field test a prototype DEMS hardware over a 12 month period.</P>
