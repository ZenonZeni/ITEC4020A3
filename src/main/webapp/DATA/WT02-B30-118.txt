<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The Best Time to Invest</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Life's milestones are what investing is all about</STRONG><BR>
Graduating, getting married, buying a home, having children, and changing jobs are
milestones that
forever mark the passage of time.  Other major events, such as sending your
children to
college or
starting your own retirement, may lie ahead.  Of course, not every milestone is a
major one. 
You may
just want to redecorate your living room or increase the amount you set aside each
month. 
Wherever
you are on life's highway and whatever goals you're pursuing, it's smart to invest
today to
help achieve
financial security tomorrow. 
<P>

<STRONG>Get started now</STRONG><BR>
The sooner you start investing, the more you can set aside and the longer your
money can
work for you. 
Which means the best time to invest is right now.
<P>
	People who wait to invest may be missing opportunities.  No one can say where
the
markets will
move next.  If you're looking for the "perfect moment," you may never know when it
comes. 
The wise
strategy is to invest today and adjust your holdings over time. 
<P>

<STRONG>Let time help reduce your risk</STRONG><BR>
Staying invested can be a powerful way to help reduce risk.  Since 1926, stock and
bond
investors have
seen both up and down markets.  While past performance is no guarantee of future
results,
in the past,
those who have stayed invested for 20 years or more have always earned positive
total
returns.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>  
<P>
	Of course, some people are inclined to sell securities when the market goes
down. 
But
experienced
investors know that selling when prices are down is one way to ensure a loss, and
staying
invested
leaves the opportunity open for possible future gains.  While there is no
guarantee that the
market will
recover, many professionals recommend buying when the market is down to increase
the
likelihood of
benefiting if there is a recovery.
<P>

<STRONG>Benefit from regular investing</STRONG><BR>
Regular investing is a convenient and cost-effective way to build your portfolio. 
If $10,000 is
more than
you can afford to invest right now, $300 a month might be within your reach.  At
that amount,
in just three
years, you'll have invested more than $10,000, not taking into account any income
or
capital
gains your
investment might earn.
<P>
If you can invest the same amount on a regular basis, the ups and downs of the
market may
potentially
work to your advantage.  In particular, you may avoid the risk of investing all of
your money
when share
prices are high.  While regular investing cannot assure a profit or protect
against loss in
declining
markets, one thing is certain  - the number of shares you own will increase over
time, giving
you a
larger stake in each of the funds you select.  Since this strategy depends on
continuous
investment in
securities regardless of fluctuating price levels, investors should consider their
ability 
to continue to make purchases through periods of varying price levels. 

<P>

<STRONG>How time can add value to your investments</STRONG><BR>
Time can be a powerful tool in helping your money grow. To see how important time
can be, look at how
much just a few years can add to a $10,000 investment earning an 8% annual return
with
monthly
compounding.
<P>
It's never too late to invest, but it pays to start early. The sooner you start
investing, the more
you can set
aside and the longer your money can work for you. Which means the best time to
invest is
right now. 
<P>
Staying invested can be a powerful way to help the reduce risk. Since 1926, stock
and
bond
investors have seen both up and down markets. While past performance is no guarantee
of
future
results, history shows that those who have stayed invested for 20 years or longer
have always
earned positive
returns.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP> 
<P>
As time passes, the rising cost of goods and services can also affect the value of
your
investments.
This process, known as inflation, may reduce the amount of 
food, clothing, housing, and healthcare your money can buy. If the cost of living
rises faster
than the
value of your savings or investments, you could actually be losing money. Even
modest
inflation can eat
away at the dollars you set aside, which is one important reason why many people use
investments to
seek higher return potential.
