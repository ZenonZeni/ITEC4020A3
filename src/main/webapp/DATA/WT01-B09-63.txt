<B>Project Title:  Optimization of an Induction Motor and Sensorless Speed Operation<p>

Performing Organization:  Delphi Energy & Engine Management Systems, Delco Propulsion Systems</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: K. Rajashekara, Delphi­E, (317) 579­3700</P> 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The focus of this project is to develop a highly efficient and reliable motor control system for
induction motors for deployment in electric and hybrid vehicles. Application of this technology to electric vehicles will
be investigated. The feasibility of extending this technology to electric buses and military applications will also be
investigated.
</P>
<P>The main objective is to make the motor drive system operate at the highest possible efficiency at any given
operation condition. This action will take place on­line. Several technologies will be investigated and the best chosen
to implement the efficiency optimization schemes. Fuzzy logic and neural network control strategies shown an
enormous potential for advancing power electronics control technology. </P>

<P>Another part of the project is to investigate the operation of the motor without using a speed sensor. Speed
sensorless operation improves the reliability and reduces the cost of the overall drive system.</P>

<P>For the advancement of electric vehicle development, the single most important technology, next to the battery, is
the power converter. The power converter control system significantly affects drive characteristics, efficiency, range,
and all dynamic characteristics of the electric vehicle. It is necessary to have high efficiency, low weight, and
reliable power converters in electric vehicles.</P> 

<P>Traditionally the efficiency is optimized based on the look­up tables. In slip frequency control schemes, the motor is
run at various slip frequencies for a given speed and motor current. The slip frequencies corresponding to maximum
efficiencies for various operating conditions are stored in a look­up table. But this method depends on the motor. For
each type of motor, this experiment has to be repeated. This is time consuming. </P>

<P>In the proposed project, the efficiency is optimized by determining the minimum input power for a given output
power. The flux is varied on­line to make the motor operate in the linear region and also to operate at a higher
efficiency point. Under steady­state, light­load operation, the drive efficiency will be improved by reducing the flux
from the rated value so that, for the same developed torque, a balance is maintained between the motor's core loss
and the copper loss. The real­time search method of control using fuzzy logic makes control independent of
machine parameters and the adaptive control reduces convergence time. </P>

<P>Fuzzy logic control enables on­line changing of the operating modes of the system. This makes it possible to
operate the motor at maximum efficiency under all operating conditions. Because fuzzy logic control provides this
flexibility, it is applicable to a wide range of electric vehicle applications including cars, buses, military tanks, and
trains.</P>

<P>Neural network technology will be used for estimation of the rotor flux. The estimated flux will be used for closed
loop flux control and it can also be used for direct field orientation control of the induction motor.</P>

<P>Elimination of the speed sensor will make the system more reliable, less expensive, and more robust. The speed
sensorless operation research work has been going on for the past 20 years. However, there is no practical speed
sensorless based induction motor drive system in existence today. There is a lot of progress that has been made in
this area. The main problem is the non­linear speed­torque characteristics of the motor and its parameter variation
with temperature, current, and frequency.</P>

<P>Delphi will work jointly with the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana University­Purdue
University at Indianapolis on a computational intelligence approach to speed sensorless operation that utilizes a
neural network/fuzzy logic/evolutionary computation hybrid approach that provides a reliable, robust and inexpensive
solution despite the system nonlinearities and parameter variations.</P>

<LI>Expected to begin May 1, 1996 & continue for 2 yrs.</UL></P>
