<p>
here are some other weaknesses in netscape's ssl:<br>
<p>
an early version of netscape's software used a weak prng to generate keys.<br>
<p>
an early version of the ssl spec made no provision for message-integrity<br>
checking, which is very necessary with a vernam cipher like rc4.<br>
<p>
in 7/95, i presented a man-in-the-middle attack on netscape's ssl,<br>
at the 1st usenix workshop on electronic commerce in manhattan. my<br>
attacker would distribute altered netscape browsers, containing<br>
spurious certification-authority keys. users of these browsers will<br>
then accept forged merchant certificates from the attacker. the<br>
attacker sets up a simultaneous session with the merchant, translating<br>
the encryption of the key-sharing messages. once the session-key is<br>
established, the attacker's active role ends; with the session-key<br>
in hand, he eavesdrops on the rest of the session. note that this is<br>
not the m-i-t-m attack addressed in the ssl specification by el gamal.<br>
<p>
my attack exploits three flaws in netscape:<br>
  * no secure channel for the verisign CA key: the netscape browser<br>
    executables are easy to modify in this way, but are hard for a<br>
    naive user to integrity-check.<br>
  * freeware distribution of executables: netscsape's browser is<br>
    commonly redistributed by other sites, including insecure<br>
    academic sites.<br>
  * without client-side authentication, the merchant's server can't<br>
    detect the man-in-the-middle.<br>
<p>
of these flaws, client-side authentication would seem to be the<br>
easiest to fix: the client uses the merchant's public-key first,<br>
then signs the resulting ciphertext with his own private key.<br>
however, signing ciphertext is vulnerable to another attack,<br>
as was pointed out by burrows, abadi, &amp; needham in '89, and by<br>
i'anson &amp; mitchell in '90. so, it's necessary to sign some of<br>
the plaintext, encrypt the signature, and sign the ciphertext,<br>
too. this solution is pretty cumbersome.<br>
<p>
i might also remark that their recent random-seed generation problem<br>
is not merely a "bug." it is very hard to fix, and netscape's track<br>
record shows that they're unlikely to get it right.<br>
