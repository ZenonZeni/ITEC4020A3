<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

The other important dimension of the Buchanan victory was his ability to attract strong support from religious fundamentalists. He received 54% of the votes of people who consider themselves to be part of the religious right compared to 11% for Dole and Alexander. The religious right is a political phenomena unique to the United States among the major industrial nations. <B>About 45% of Americans go to church every Sunday compared to only 5-10% in Europe. As the U.S. was founded by religious dissenters, it has a free market in religion whereas in Europe religion is often a nationalized industry.</B> Britain has a state church under the nominal rule of the monarch while the Catholic church is the official church in many other countries. The number of Americans who classify themselves as evangelical Protestants is about 25% today or the same as thirty years ago. But during the interim, many evangelical Protestants have moved from a relatively modest and rural socio economic status firmly into the suburban middle class and thus greatly enhanced their ability to influence the political system. The population of mainstream Protestants, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% of the U.S. total in the 1960's to about 20% today. Catholics have been steady at about 25% of the population while the population of secularist (no religious affiliation) has expanded from 1-2% thirty years ago to about 15% currently. <B>The rise of the religious right has played a very important role in the revival of the Republican Party during recent years.</B> According to surveys of the 1994 congressional elections, the Republicans attracted the support of 78% of Mormons and 75% of evangelical Protestants, compared to 56% of the votes of mainline Protestants and 53% of Catholics. Without strong support from the religious right, Buchanan would probably have received less than 20% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and thus come in third. He also benefited from the fact that New Hampshire permits Democrats and independents to vote in the Republican primary. As the Democrats had no presidential primary, some of their voters probably cast votes for Buchanan on the grounds that he would be the most divisive of Republican candidates.
<P>

<B>While Buchanan cannot win the Republican nomination, the question still hovering over the markets is how his electoral success will influence other candidates and public policy after 1996.</B> Will his victories encourage other candidates to support more protectionist trade policies? Will the issue of job insecurity cause other candidates to promise more federal money for job training, unemployment relief, or other safety net programs? Will resentment at growing income inequality encourage political support for a return to much higher marginal income tax rates on high income Americans, especially the corporate executives who collect large bonuses and stock option awards while reducing employment in their companies? In 1992, Bill Clinton had campaigned on a platform called "Putting People First" which had pledged to spend $200 billion of federal money on various human capital programs to bolster productivity and real wages. He abandoned most of these promises in order to pursue deficit reduction during 1993 and focus on health care in 1994. When the Republicans captured the Congress in 1994, he further retreated from the campaign themes of 1992 and stressed in his recent State of the Union message that the era of big government is over. Yet, the Buchanan electoral success suggests that there is a political market among less skilled people for campaign promises to bolster job security through some form of government intervention. As a result of the racial profile of his constituency, Mr. Buchanan focused far more heavily on trade protection than government sponsored income redistribution or worker training but it is not difficult to imagine other candidates putting forward federal programs linking the two issues.
<P>

<B>The Buchanan victory in New Hampshire probably creates three major risks for public policy after the election.</B> First, it will be more difficult for the next president to promote new free trade legislation, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile. Secondly, despite the electoral success of Steve Forbes in Delaware and Arizona, it will be more challenging to develop broad bi-partisan support for a tax reform program to reduce marginal income tax rates or provide new tax allowances for savings. Thirdly, there will be greater willingness to tinker with new tax incentives for promoting certain forms of corporate behavior such as protecting jobs or increasing spending on human capital. In fact, two Democratic Senators will soon be introducing legislation to redesign the corporate tax code to provide new tax incentives for job protection and training programs. Mr. Robert Kuttner described the legislation in a recent issue of Business Week:
<P>

 "Bingaman and Daschle have therefore turned to the one avenue that might produce some traction: inducing corporations to embrace a 'stakeholder' model. The draft legislation, to be released in late February, proposes a new class of corporations, the R Corp.-'R' for Responsible. The idea is to reward corporations that invest in employees and communities instead of pursuing relentless downsizing that boosts short-term profits."
<P>

 "An R Corp. would receive lower taxes and streamlined regulatory treatment. Specifically, the plan replaces the corporate income tax with a 'business activity tax' of the sort proposed in 1994 by Senators John C. Danforth (R-MO) and David L. Boren (D-Okla.). This tax applies a fixed rate to all receipts, subtracting payments for most inputs. Employee training and R&#38;D expenses would be tax-deductible, while wages dividends, and interest would not. Under this plan, an R Corp. would be taxed at 11%, compared with 18% for conventional corporations. It would also pay reduced payroll taxes and be able to self-certify in several areas of regulation."
<P>

 "Compensation Ratio. To qualify, a corporation would be required to contribute 3% of payroll to a portable, multi-employer pension plan, devote 2% to employee training, pay half the costs of a qualifying health plan, and have a profit-sharing plan or employee stock ownership plan with employee trustees."
<P>

 "Another requirement would be to hold the compensation ratio of the highest to lowest paid employee to no more than 50 to 1, compared with the 130-to-1 ratio in some corporations . An R Corp. would have a 'community responsibility agreement' tempering relocations and layoffs. It would be unionized or have an employee-involvement plan. An R Corp. could not use child or prison labor anywhere in the world and half of its new investment and employment would have to be in the U.S."
<P>

 "The Bingaman plan includes a tax of the sort long proposed by Yale University economist James Tobin on the profits of short-term securities trades. The proceeds would finance a social capital fund for worker training, school-to-work transition programs, industrial extension, export promotion, and technology research and development."
<P>

If there has to be a federal programatic response to public concern about job insecurity, the new Democratic proposals are far superior to the Buchanan program of high tariffs. But attempts to use tax allowances to promote various forms of corporate behavior also raise troublesome questions about the efficiency of resource allcoation, including whether the government will simply end up subsidizing investments which corporations would have made anyway.
<P>

In Britain, the new Labor Party leader, Mr. Tony Blair, has been making numerous speeches about the theme of promoting "stakeholder capitalism" over the traditional form which merely protects the interests of shareholders. The theme of stakeholder capitalism has caught on with only a few Democratic Party intellectuals, such as Labor Secretary Robert Reich, but the Buchanan primary victories will encourage more discussion about American corporate behavior as the campaign progresses. <B>Although promoting discussion about "stakeholder capitalism" is an intelligent way for Washington policy wonks to channel populist outrage over foreign competition and corporate labor shedding into a coherent examination of public policy choices, it is difficult to imagine the next Congress enacting any substantive legislation to promote stakeholder capitalism.</B> First, the traditional models of stakeholder capitalism, such as Germany and Japan, have been suffering from prolonged recessions in part because their corporate sectors are carrying very high embedded social costs. In Germany, unemployment is rising sharply as German firms attempt to escape from the country's high social benefit costs by shifting jobs to the U.S., eastern Europe and other low wage countries. Secondly, corporations which need well trained workers are already spending heavily on education while small firms would regard legislation requiring investment in new federally mandated programs as a reason to curtail employment. Thirdly, the next Congress will still have to address the issue of federal deficit reduction, so expensive new tax allowances will be challenged by House and Senate committee chairmen. As with Bill Clinton's Putting People First program in 1993, the promises of presidential election campaigns will fade quickly if the American legislative branch remains as conservative about fiscal policy as it has been during recent years. Since the Buchanan and Forbes campaign are personality driven phenomena without any large scale organizations to influence congressional races, it is doubtful that the 1996 presidential race will produce major changes in congressional attitudes towards issues such as deficit reduction and federal spending. <B>But as the presidential contest will dominate political news coverage during the next few months, concern about right wing populism undermining support for deficit reduction and free trade in the Republican Party will probably continue to produce a higher political risk premium in U.S. bond yields.</B> This risk premium will be a de facto tax on the economy to compensate investors for the risk of extreme outcomes in the November elections for the White House and Congress.
