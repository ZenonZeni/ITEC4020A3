<B><FONT SIZE=4 >Press Freedom Groups Urge Algerian Government to Release Political Cartoonist, End Ban on His Newspaper</B><BR>
</FONT><BR>
NEW YORK-- Two international organizations that defend press freedom, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.calvacom.fr//rsf/">(RSF)</A>, today demanded the release of Chawki Amari, a cartoonist with the independent Algerian daily <I>La Tribune</I>, and called on the government to end legal proceedings against two of his colleagues from the paper.<P>

The trial of Amari, Kheireddine Ameyar, <I>La Tribune&#146;s</I> publisher, and Baya Gacemi, the editor in chief, will begin on Monday, July 29. Amari was arrested at his home in Algiers on the morning of July 4.  He is charged with desecrating a national emblem for drawing a cartoon, published on July 2, which depicted the Algerian flag in a satiric manner. If convicted of this offense, Amari could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison. On July 10, an examining magistrate denied Amari&#146;s request for bail. He is being held at Serkadji prison.<P>

On July 3, <I>La Tribune</I>&#146;s offices were sealed and Ameyar and Gacemi were placed under judicial supervision and ordered to appear before the court twice a week. <P>

Publishers of independent newspapers in Algeria yesterday denounced the detention of Amari and the suspension of <I>La Tribune</I> and called for an end to press censorship. Algerian journalists, who for three years have been the targets of an assassination campaign by extremists, held a one-day strike on July 15 to demand Amari&#146;s release and the reopening of <I>La Tribune</I>.  <P>

CPJ and RSF consider the imprisonment of Amari and the suspension of<I> La Tribun</I>e to be grave violations of press freedom. And we believe that government censorship, which forces the press to print government propaganda as news, jeopardizes journalists who face a constant threat of assassination by terrorists.<P>

CPJ and RSF join our Algerian colleagues in calling on the government of Algeria to demonstrate its commitment to freedom of the press by:<BR>
<!-- List Tag --><UL>
<LI>Immediately releasing Chawki Amari <BR>
<LI>Ending legal proceedings against Kheireddine Ameyar and Baya Gacemi<BR>
<LI>Lifting the suspension of<I> La Tribune</I>    and<BR>
<LI>Ending government press censorship<BR>
</UL>
