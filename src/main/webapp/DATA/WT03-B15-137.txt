<H2>March 1995</H2>

<P>Robot Simulations was formed in 1989, by Dr. John Owens, to bring to the market a software system called WORKSPACE. This product group is the result of research carried out by John Owens for his Ph.D. in Robotics, Simulation, Advanced Languages and Control.</P>

<P>The first version to be introduced was WORKSPACE 1.0, which was the first 3D robot simulation to run on a PC, in the world. As with all new products feedback from customers was essential in identifying possible areas of improvement, leading to, in 1991, the release of WORKSPACE 2.0. This received much greater recognition within the robotics establishment and was gradually accepted  within higher education and industry as a valuable teaching, training and learning tool.</P>

<P>Robot Simulations Limited (RSL) was incorporated in December 1992, when Roger Verrall came in as Managing Director, allowing John Owens to concentrate on finalising WORKSPACE 3.0. This is a product for industry as well as education. The features that were incorporated brought PC based software ever closer to workstation systems as a very much more cost effective alternative. Full factory lay-outs with unlimited number of robots and mechanisms can be designed, calibrated, simulated and programmed, as one model. Apart from robot and model calibration there is inverse kinematics, robot languages, over 100 industrial and educational robot models, DXF/IGES interface, 3D graphics in SuperVGA (256 colours), computer aided learning files all on a standard modern PC. This increases the number of companies who can now afford to automate, without incurring the high cost of workstation hardware/software.</P>

<P>In July 1994 RSL linked with Robot Dynamics to market the Robotrak measuring system. This is an electro-mechanical set of units that can when linked with WORKSPACE 3+ (latest version) produce accurate calibration for off-line programming. This process is the subject of a patent application.</P>

<P>RSL is based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has a policy of employing graduates with either computing or engineering disciplines. With increased staff levels, the ongoing development of the new WORKSPACE versions and other systems is well underway. To keep ahead of the field RSL develops products of quality with speed. The emphasis on quality and customer support has led to RSL doubling its turnover each year to reach 6 figures in just 3 years.</P>

<P>Sales have increased to UK. colleges and export markets on each continent. The Japanese and the USA have recognised the value of PC based simulation systems and development work is underway with major blue chip companies worldwide. Experience has shown the value of good agents with ability to recognise the value of WORKSPACE in the long term, not for the quick return.</P>

<P>RSL is a totally independent company, with no outside shareholders or venture capital. WORKSPACE is an in-house development, suitable for both robot manufacturers and users, each receiving equal service and confidentiality.</P>
