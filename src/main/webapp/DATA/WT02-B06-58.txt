Agreement Terms</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
1. The CompuServe Information Service (the &quot;Service&quot;) consists
of computing and information services and software, information and other
content provided by CompuServe Incorporated (&quot;CompuServe&quot;), as
well as access to services, software, information and other content provided
by third parties (collectively, &quot;Third Party Content&quot;). These
terms and any Operating Rules published over the Service constitute the
entire and only agreement (collectively, the &quot;Service Agreement&quot;)
between CompuServe and member (one who has an account with CompuServe for
the Service), including member's designated users with respect to the Service
and supersede all other communications and agreements with regard to the
subject matter hereof.<BR>
<BR>
2. Upon notice published over the Service, CompuServe may modify this Service
Agreement, (including the Operating Rules) or prices, and may discontinue
or revise any or all other aspects of the Service in its sole discretion
and without prior notice.<BR>
<BR>
3. Unless otherwise agreed, member's right to use the Service or to designate
users is not transferable and is subject to any limits established by CompuServe,
or by member's credit card company if billing is through a credit card.<BR>
<BR>
4. Member agrees to indemnify CompuServe against liability for any and all
use of member's account.<BR>
<BR>

6. Member shall pay, in accordance with the provisions of the Billing Option
selected by member, any registration or monthly fees, connect time charges,
minimum charges and other charges<BR>
incurred by member or its designated users at the rates in effect for the
billing period in which those charges are incurred, including but not limited
to charges for any purchases made<BR>
through the Service and any surcharges incurred while using any supplemental
networks or services other than the Service. Member shall pay all applicable
taxes related to use of the Service by<BR>
member or its designated users. Information on connect time charges and
surcharges (if any) that are incurred by a member will be made available
to the member online. Although certain<BR>
areas of the Service may be designated as free of charge, member acknowledges
that CompuServe incurs substantial costs in maintaining these areas. Accordingly,
if in CompuServe's judgment the member's account reflects an excessive number
of hours in such areas, CompuServe reserves the right to charge for such
excess (at normal connect time rates).<BR>
<BR>
Member shall be responsible for all use of the Service accessed through
member's or its designated users' password(s). For example, member may allow
individuals in its household to use the<BR>
Service through member's account. Member acknowledges that member is aware
that areas accessible on or through the Service may contain material that
is unsuitable for minors (persons under 18 years of age). Member agrees
to supervise usage of the Service by minors whom member permits to use the
Service.<BR>
<BR>

assign or transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations under this license
is void.<BR>
<BR>
11. This Service Agreement is made in Ohio, and shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and
of the State of Ohio. Any cause of action of member or its designated users
with respect to the Service must be instituted within one year after the
claim or cause of action has arisen or be barred.<BR>
<BR>
12. If Member's account is a qualified business account and approved by
CompuServe for corporate billing, charges for the services provided under
this Service Agreement will be accumulated and identified by User ID number
and will normally be invoiced following the end of the month in which the
service is provided. Terms of payment on all charges are net, ten (10) days

by the member within thirty (30) days after the invoice date, late charges
of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month shall be due and payable
with respect to such payment, and CompuServe may, in addition, at its sole
discretion and without notice to the member, (a) suspend its performance
under this Service Agreement and the member's and its designated users'
access to and use of the Service, or (b) terminate this Service Agreement

any provision or condition in any purchase order, voucher, or other memorandum
of the member which is in any way inconsistent with, or adds to, the provisions
of this Service Agreement is null and void. Neither the course of conduct
between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify the provisions of
this Service Agreement. CompuServe may authorize or allow its contractors
and other third parties to provide to CompuServe and/or to member services
necessary or related to making the Service available and to perform obligations
and exercise rights of CompuServe under this Service Agreement, and may
collect payment on their behalf, if applicable. If any provision of this
Service Agreement is determined to be invalid, all other provisions shall
remain in full force and effect. The provisions of paragraphs 4, 7, 9, and
13 and all obligations of and restrictions on member and its designated
users shall survive any termination of this Agreement.<BR>

completely different physical network than CompuServe's communications network
and different content than that normally available on the Service. The reliability,
availability and performance of resources accessed through the Internet
are beyond CompuServe's control and are not in any way warranted or supported
by CompuServe or its third party contractors. Member acknowledges that safeguards

<H2><CENTER>CompuServe and Mailing Lists</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<EM>CompuServe has two additional documents that detail their policies with
mailing lists.</EM>
<PRE>Description: About Mailing Lists
Header: About Mailing Lists
Trailer: CIS:FRE-275

In our continuous effort to provide our customers with the best 
possible service, we occasionally utilize our membership list
mailings.  From time to time, special CompuServe mailings may be
sent.  CompuServe also sometimes makes its membership mailing lists
available to other companies who wish to send our members
information about the products or services.

Most members enjoy receiving these mailings, however, you have the
option of including or excluding your name from these various
mailing lists.  Your name will be included on all lists unless you
specify otherwise.  Your choice is not permanent and you can change
it at anytime.  For more information, and to choose to
include/exclude your name, select menu options 2-5 on the previous
menu.

From this area you may also choose to include/exclude yourself from
the Membership directory.  Including your account name and User Id
number in this directory will enable others to communicate with you
through CompuServe Mail.</PRE>

<PRE>Description: CompuServe Special Mailings
Header: CompuServe Special Mailings
Trailer: CIS:FRE-279

Special CompuServe mailings might include tips and hints for using
a particular service more effectively, a step-by-step tutorial,
announcements of new online services, or maybe even a connect time
credit!  Or one of our Information Providers might send a mailing
about his or her particular service.  In any event, the mailings
would always feature ways to better use CompuServe or a specific
online product or service.  You have the option to include or
exclude your name from this mailing list.  All changes will take
effect at the time of our next quarterly update.<A NAME="go_member"></A>
