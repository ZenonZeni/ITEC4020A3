<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Story of the Missing Nutritional Link</CENTER></H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>
By Donald O. Rudin, M.D.</CENTER></H3>

Debi Erin is a lovely, bright, and vivacious young woman. She has shown courage and
intelligence in recounting her own story. For a number of years, she has been a
successful nurse.  But for a decade, starting in her mid-teens, she suffered from
what can only be called, in lay terms, the &quot;horrors.&quot;  
<P>
She was repeatedly hospitalized and treated by a dozen different psychiatrists for
schizophrenia, a diagnosis which seems as accurate as any other, for she was
afflicted by daily visual and sometimes auditory hallucinations, intrusive thinking
and compulsive behavior including attacks forcing her into a peculiar sideways walk,
in addition to head-banging and other violent behavior.  She also had a wide variety
of physical disorders, some probably related to immune system problems; all of them
were aspects of her mental illness.
<P>
Debi fell into the group of about 30% of schizophrenics who neither deteriorate nor
spontaneously recover but show a more or less constant illness pattern over the
years.  Consistently, she remained intellectually bright and had insight into her
illness, recognizing that she was &quot;crazy.&quot; While this gave hope that she could
recover, it meant that she experienced the &quot;horrors&quot; of it all, for she knew when she
was hallucinating and consciously suffered the many other aspects of her illness. 
<P>
Under the guidance of a devoted mother and father, Debi submitted to every treatment
known, from antipsychotic drugs to dialysis. While the dialysis helped temporarily
for a few days after treatment, nothing gave her permanent relief. Most observers
were convinced she would be severely ill for the rest of her life.
<P>
At this point in her prolonged illness, I was contacted by her astute and dedicated
mother who had read some of my publications dealing with what I considered to be the
nutritional missing link in the diet. This is the omega-3 oils or
ultrapolyunsaturates (alpha-linolenic acid), which are about 80% depleted in the
modern diet. This means we obtain 
<I>
only 20% 
</I>
of these essential fatty acids, so necessary for optimal health, in our standard
American diet.
<P>
They're depleted as a result of hydrogenation, oil refining, and the consumption of
warm-climate foods and oils by people of cold-climate, or northern extraction,
especially if they're still living in the north.  Moreover, this family of essential
nutrients seems to be especially important for primates in brain function. Yet most
nutritionists have missed it all.
<P>
Although I had seen remarkable improvement of a variety of physical disorders on
omega-3 dietary supplements, Erin was my first patient with a mental disorder. Her
favorable response, starting with the first tablespoon of food grade linseed oil-this
was a traditional cooking oil in common use before 1940-was one of the great thrills
of my life. For the sake of the patient, of course, we physicians are supposed to
keep such feelings to ourselves.
<P>
Over the the next year, Erin learned to adjust her dosage level while all her
symptoms gradually improved. For many years now, she has been almost entirely
symptom-free, leading a productive life to the astonishment of her friends and
psychiatrists. 
<P>
After working with Erin, I suspect that a significant fraction of modern illness is
caused by an extensive omega-3 essential fatty acid deficiency.
<P>
All of this produces  what can best be called the Modernization Disease Syndrome,
possibly the single most common cause of illness today and one afflicting every organ
system depending on genetic susceptibility.  This is, in every way, the parallel of
the catastrophic vitamin deficiency syndromes of the last century and the early part
of this one, e.g., pellagra and BY Donald O. Rudin, beriberi, which were caused by
indiscriminate food refining.  
<P>

EDITOR'S NOTE: This article was adapted from Dr. Rudin's Foreword to Debi Erin's
book. Donald O. Rudin, M.D., a graduate of Harvard Medical School and former director
of the Department of Molecular Biology at Eastern Psychiatric Institute in
Philadelphia, has been researching essential fatty acids and health since 1956.

Dr. Rudin is the author of The Omega-3 Phenomenon: The Nutritional Breakthrough of the 80s (1987) and The Omega-3 Oils (Avery, 1995). Now retired, he lives and travels in the Virgin Islands, where he may be contacted by fax at 809-775-3590.
