<P>
If you suffer from fatigue, muscle aches, food sensitivities, psoriasis,
asthma, and many other common complaints, your health problems may be yeast-related, says
William G. Crook, M.D. Dr. Crook is not only a practicing physician, but a well-regarded
lecturer and author of 11 books and numerous articles. Too much yeast (specifically, Candida
albicans) in the body is a problem that applies equally to men and women (despite Crook's
gender-specific title), which means this book should interest all those with a chronic
illness or health condition-and their physicians. 
<P>Candida albicans, a common yeast, normally lives in the human body where it causes no
problems provided the biochemistry is balanced and the immune system is strong. But
prescription drugs, hormonal changes, infections, improper diet, and other factors can cause
a yeast overgrowth in the intestinal tract, thereby producing a dismaying list of symptoms.
Yeast infections then weaken the immune system and "like a stream cascading down a mountain,
set off disturbances that can make you feel sick all over," explains Dr. Crook.
<P>These "disturbances" include irritable bowel syndrome, vaginal yeast infections,
endometriosis, headaches, depression, multiple sclerosis, and others. The list of
yeast-related diseases itself may come to many readers as a revelation of holistic medical
investigation. 
<P>Dr. Crook argues that the primary contributing factor in yeast overgrowth is too many
broad-spectrum antibiotics in the system. While Dr. Crook does not state that yeast is the
sole cause of chronic health problems, he suggests that too much Candida albicans in the
body may be one of the prime causes of many health problems.
<P>Crook supplies the reader with numerous questionnaires to help determine whether or not a
health problem may be yeast-related and he offers a step-by-step practical program to help
you overcome it. Along the way, he discusses hormones, parasites, specific nutritional
supplements, free radicals, diet, the mind-body connection, nonprescription antiyeast
medications, and a great deal more. The result is an uncommonly useful and meticulously
detailed book by one of alternative medicine's leading  doctors.

<P>"There is an enormous infrastructure in place, built up since the 1940s, that supports
and promotes the use of toxic pesticides," states Marion Moses, M.D. She's a physician who
has spent 30 years investigating pesticide-related health problems in farmworkers and their
families. She and the volunteers at her Pesticide Education Center collaborated in producing
this book so the informed reader can choose other, less toxic methods to ultimately "tame
the toxic beast." 
<P>Too often people give no thought to what is in those containers of "designer poisons"
they buy to bomb their homes, spray their pets, and shampoo their children. But Dr. Moses
says we had better start giving it a lot of thought. Bug sprays may have been designed to
kill insects, but they're proving to be poisons to humans as well.
<P>Did you know there is an over-the-counter pesticide (Lindane) that has been linked to
brain cancer and leukemia? Or that there are pesticides you can buy that act like (or
interfere with) female hormones, lodge in fatty tissue, and cause cancer?  Or that there is 
a lice shampoo that contains a pesticide linked to brain cancer in children?<P>There is
even a pesticide used to kill termites that depletes the earth's ozone layer. 
<P>Designer Poisons is a virtual encyclopedia of tables, charts, quantities, brand names,
ingredients-everything you need to know to make informed decisions. With Dr. Moses' capable
and thoroughly documented guidance, "you can choose pest control methods that are safer for
you, your family, your pets, your neighbors, and the environment."

<P>An estimated 575 million women, worldwide, are in menopause, but what does it mean to a
woman?  Women become old, dried up, and useless after menopause-that's still the prevailing
myth in our society about life after menopause, but to counter this erroneous view, Jill
Holden and Jesse Hanley, M.D., emphasize that menopause is a time for a woman to be honored,
not ashamed.<P> 
<P>Dr. Hanley, Medical Director of the Malibu Health and Rehabilitation Center,  provides
expert advice about alternative health options and the dangers of standardized hormone
replacement therapy. She also reviews what happens in a woman's body at menopause. One bold
new fact that emerges here is that the symptom picture of  menopause is individualized,
based on each woman's lifestyle, her use of chemicals (prescription drugs and birth control
pills), and personal medical history. Dr. Hanley also shows pre-menopausal women how
detoxification, herbs, and natural diet can prevent future health problems when menopause
begins.
<P>"Life is not over after forty," Dr. Hanley discovered for herself. "There are positive
changes in a woman's sense of freedom, power, and wisdom."

<P>
"This is a book on optimal nutrition, not adequate nutrition," says Robert Crayhon, M.S.  "A
book on adequate nutrition is as interesting as a financial guide for staying above the poverty
level," he quips. Crayhon should know: he is a practicing nutritionist, host of the syndicated
"Voice of Wellness" radio show and the cable television show, "Alternative Medicine." 
<P>His book is stocked with how-tos, lists of helpful nutrients to take, and ways to improve
your health using alternative medicine. With his quick wit and quirky sense of humor, Crayhon
makes nutrition education enjoyable as he walks you through all the latest information about
exactly what you need to stay healthy. His lists are unique, fun to read, and informative.
<P>For example, here are the "Top 10 Things to Put on Your Shopping List:" fresh fruits and
vegetables; fermented dairy products; organic flaxseed, canola, or olive oil; fresh, pure
water; dried beans, lentils, and peas; whole grains; salsa; unfermented green tea; raw nuts;
and herbs. Along the way, he gives you the "Top 10 Reasons Why Most Doctors Do Not Know
Anything about Nutrition." Reason No. 6: "Nutrition promotes the self-empowerment of the
patient, which some physicians find threatening."

<P>"It amazes me how much of what passes for knowledge in cancer therapy turns out to be
incomplete, inadequate, and anecdotal," states Ralph Moss, Ph.D., author of The Cancer Industry
and Cancer Therapy. In  Questioning Chemotherapy, Moss intends to spark an international debate
on whether the toxic drug,  chemotherapy, has any value in the treatment of cancer, whether
it's any better than sugar pills.
<P>The evidence that chemotherapy, or "bottled death," as some critics call it, prolongs a
cancer patient's life or improves its quality is nearly nonexistent, says Moss. "Oncologists
have been derelict in not doing reproducible studies to investigate this question." That's why
Moss is questioning the chemotherapy establishment.
<P>Modern chemotherapy derives from experiments with poisonous mustard gas in the 1940s; its
claims are based on the temporary improvement in a mouse and one patient in a single
experiment. Definitive clinical trials have rarely been carried out and fail to support the
claims of the advocates of chemotherapy. Cancer patient hospital bills are almost $90 billion
per year,  almost 10 percent of the total U.S. health bill. Linguistic dodges, biases, and
exclusion, or fraudulent presentation of data make chemo-therapy appear far more effective than
it really is.
<P>We need to be informed medical consumers, to question doctors, and be aware there is a party
line in the medical system, Moss advises.  Chemotherapy is pushed as an ideological fixture in
medicine, keeping patients oriented toward "proper" (allopathic) medical therapy-but that
doesn't mean it's the best cancer treatment. When you get chemotherapy, it reduces the
likelihood of your benefiting from other promising nontoxic, nutritional, or immunological
treatments, Moss adds. "If you are a sane and sentient adult you have an absolute right to
take or refuse any treatment," says Moss. A new critical attitude about chemo-therapy could be
your turning point towards health wisdom and survival.
