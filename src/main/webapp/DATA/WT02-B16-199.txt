<p><font size=+2>F</font>rench physicist Edmond 
Becquerel first described the photovoltaic (PV) effect in 1839, but it remained a 
curiosity of science for the next three quarters of a century.  At only 19, Becquerel found that
certain materials would produce small amounts of electric current when exposed to 
light.  The effect was first studied in solids, such as selenium, by Heinrich Hertz in 
the 1870s.  Soon afterward, selenium PV cells were converting light to electricity at 
1% to 2% efficiency. As a result, selenium was quickly adopted in the emerging field 
of photography for use in light-measuring devices.

<p>Major steps toward 
commercializing PV were taken in the 1940s and early 1950s, when the Czochralski 
process was developed for producing highly pure <a href="sipolysi.html">crystalline silicon</a>.  
In 1954, scientists at Bell Laboratories depended on the Czochralski process to develop 
the first crystalline silicon photovoltaic cell, which had an efficiency of 4%.
