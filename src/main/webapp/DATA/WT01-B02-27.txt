There have been literally hundreds of calls coming to Brian each month from state home schooling organizations and media reporters wanting information on home schoolers. Betsy and the seven children are busy with the work of raising a family, home schooling, and operating a small farm.  The older girls are helping to key data on computers for the new nationwide study (which is an update to the 1990 study which NHERI did for HSLDA) currently in progress.<H4>The Tindall family</H4><P>The Tindalls are helping Brian do some of the data keying work, and Mike has been helping Brian to plan some of the upcoming research projects. Mike has been a tireless assistant, and has contributed greatly to the recent growth and development of NHERI. We are extremely grateful for his hard work and his prayerful commitment to NHERI.<H4>The Lloyd family</H4><P>The Lloyds has been busy teaching their three children at home.  Bill works during the day as a researcher at the Census Bureau, and works for NHERI part-time as the Washington DC Branch Manager.  Bill, as NHERI Research Associate, has had several interviews with various television and radio stations, newspaper columnists, writers, and other media journalists. The Lloyd family was featured in a television show on Maryland Public TV that focused on home schooling. Bill recently received a videotape from the producers of Lifestyle Magazine, a nationally-syndicated talk show.  Bill appeared on Lifestyle Magazine in May 1996, and was the home school research expert in that show, representing NHERI.  Bill also was on a radio program on WJHU in Baltimore as a spokesman for NHERI and home schooling research.  Copies of these audio and videotapes are available from NHERI's Washington DC Branch Office.<H2>UPCOMING NHERI RESEARCH</H2><P>NHERI is in the process of conducting a nationwide follow-up to the 1990 study which Brian did. The questionnaires have been mailed out to and returned from the sample households. The questionnaires are being keyed into a data file, from which the results will be tabulated. We'll keep you posted as to when the results will be available.<P>NHERI is also doing research for several state home schooling associations. The results are available for a fee from NHERI.
