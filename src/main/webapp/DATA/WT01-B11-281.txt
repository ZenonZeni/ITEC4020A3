<B>Performance Highlights</B>

<UL>
<LI>During October and November the fixed income market rallied, fueled by election results and data indicating a slowing economy and low inflation.
<LI>The money market yield curve (yields on securities with maturities of up to 1 year) flattened during December -- year-end borrowing demand forced yields higher in very short maturities (overnight to 1 month), while yields fell 10 to 20 basis points for longer maturities.
<LI>We were cautious about holding many securities maturing in January, as rates often decline during that month.  During the quarter, we continued to purchase selected longer securities (maturing in 9 months to 1 year) as we found attractive values.
<LI>The average maturity of the portfolio shortened slightly during the quarter.  The Fund's assets increased by $80 million.
