ELECTRIC RESTRUCTURING: ELCON Releases Its Blueprint For The Future

The Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON), a Washington,
D.C.-based trade association representing large industrial
customers, has released its "Blueprint for Customer Choice," which
it believes contains the economic and regulatory frameworks, as
well as legislative reforms needed for the emergence of real
competition in the electric industry.

ELCON advocates removal of federal and state impediments to market
entry by any entity that seeks to provide or purchase products or
services presently offered as a bundled service by utilities. ELCON
believes that only a minimum of physical assets and services need
be regulated to ensure the reliable operation of the grid. It wants
all market segments to be unbundled. But while generation service
should not be regulated, the rates, terms, and conditions for use
of transmission and distribution facilities that continue to be
provided as monopoly services should be regulated.

Existing contractual relationships between native load customers
and their utilities, and between utilities and their suppliers,
should be honored. But ELCON advocates that utilities mitigate
stranded costs by writing off or writing down those assets against
earnings, by the sale of those or other nongenerator assets, by
renegotiating purchased power or fuel supply contracts, and by cost
reductions. No utility should be allowed to seek recovery of any
costs associated with uneconomic assets that were incurred
subsequent to enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).
ELCON desires creation of an independent system operator, splitting
the traditional distribution functions between a "wires" business
and the electric services merchant business, and creation of a
federal-state joint board to recommend actions to state
legislatures.

Cynthia Mansfield, a General Public Utilities Vice President, and
a leader of the PURPA Reform Group, expressed dissatisfaction that
ELCON would deny utilities recovery of prudently incurred costs
associated with uneconomic assets committed to after passage of
EPAct, yet require utilities to continue buying PURPA power for the
indefinite future. Mansfield claimed that ELCON's proposal to
extend PURPA benefits to all producers and consumers who had
achieved PURPA qualifying status by the beginning of the transition
period, would increase stranded costs.

GAS TRANSPORTATION: Bay State Gas To Offer New Programs

The Massachusetts commission has approved a settlement authorizing
Bay State Gas Co. (BSG) to redesign its gas rates and launch a
residential unbundling pilot program, believed by BSG to be the
first of its kind offered in New England.

The pilot will allow participating residential customers to buy
natural gas transportation service from BSG, while choosing gas
suppliers. The program will be conducted in three phases of
development, pilot implementation (by heating season of 1996), and
program assessment.

The settlement will enable BSG to introduce new rates that more
closely reflect the actual costs associated with serving different
customer classes. New rates became effective January 1, 1996.

Other components of the utility's rate redesign will be aimed at
making transportation service from BSG more attractive to a larger
group of commercial and industrial customers. (Presently only 100
of BSG's largest customers buy unbundled transportation service).
Specifically, BSG will offer supplemental gas supply service during
the winter period to meet seasonal demand. Also, it will offer
`needle peaking' service to help commercial and industrial
customers guard against supply shortfalls during the coldest days
when marketers may be unable to guarantee deliveries.

CREDIT RATINGS: Moody's: Northeastern Utilities Are Under Pressure

Moody's Investors Service has released a report, "Northeast Break-
Even Analysis," which foundsthat while wide variations exist in the
cost structures of investor-owned, municipal, and state electric
utilities in the Northeastern United States, that in a deregulated,
price competitive market for electricity, a solid majority of the
utilities would be at a significant disadvantage in relation to
their peers in contiguous regions. If full competition is
introduced, Moody's concluded that Northeastern utilities with
above average costs likely would experience deterioration in credit
quality as some investments are unrecoverable from ratepayers.

Moody's defines the Northeast competitive arena as all major rated
utilities within two transmission interconnects of Consolidated
Edison Co. of New York. It includes 25 IOUs in nine states, as well
as two public power and two Canadian utilities. They represent over
$153 billion in combined assets, $29.7 billion in combined equity,
and over $48 billion in annual revenues.

Moody's said that most of the utilities have the highest "break-
even" prices in the nation. (Moody's defines break-even as the
price a utility must charge for each unit of capacity to cover its
fixed charges after applying all profits or margins from its energy
sales. Because Moody's generating cost model is a residual
analysis, differences in relative cost position are magnified,
which allows for meaningful comparisons among utilities).

Moody's estimated $43 billion in stranded costs in this region
alone, which accounts for about one quarter of all U.S. stranded
costs.

Regulatory initiatives remain at the information gathering stage,
with principles for guiding an orderly transition to competition in
place in New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island (see Weekly No.
3234). They are in the process of being developed or endorsed in
New Hampshire, New Jersey, Vermont and Maine (see weekly Nos. 3228,
3230, 3234). Moody's noted that Pennsylvania is leaning toward a
"wait and see" approach, with a recent PUC staff recommendation
suggesting that it is not yet time for extreme change.

Based on average price assumptions, Moody's found that only Hydro-
Quebec would be able to cover all fixed costs and earn a profit
through energy sales alone. Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power
Authority fell at the low end of the scale, with negative break-
even prices, reflecting much hydrogeneration. At the high end of
the price scale are United Illuminating, Long Island Lighting Co.,
and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co-op. Moody's said
it expects downgrades to continue for utilities in the Northeast,
especially due to negative transition cost decisions and definitive
moves toward open access.

ELECTRIC RATES: S.Carolina E&G Pleased With Ruling

The South Carolina PSC has approved a $67.5 million (7.34%) retail
electric rate hike for South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. (SCEG), to
be phased-in over a two-year period. SCEG had requested a $76.7
million (8.35%) increase.

The approved rates are based on a 12% return on common equity,
resulting in an overall return on rate base on 9.59%. The Phase 1
increase of about $59.5 million (6.47%), will become effective upon
completion and commercial operation of SCEG's new, 385-Mw, coal-
fired Cope generating plant, expected January 15, 1996. The total
capital cost of the plant is expected to be about $436 million
(including AFDC), which is under the original budget of $537
million. About one-half of the plant's total capital cost already
is included in base rates due to a June, 1993 order. The PSC now
approved recovery of remaining capital costs and annual operating
expenses associated with Cope.

Also included in Phase 1 is a $4.3 million increase for a storm
damage reserve account, that will be capped at $50 million and
collected through rates over a ten-year period.

The PSC granted SCEG's request to accelerate recovery of almost all
its regulatory assets, and to shift about $257 million of
depreciation reserves from its transmission and distribution assets
to nuclear production assets. The latter change will enhance its
competitive position by reducing the cost of its nuclear
generation.

INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS: Moody's Finds U.K. Deal Manageable

Moody's Investors Service has lowered the commercial paper rating
for Central and South West Corp. (CSW) from `P-1' to 'P-2' in
response to significantly greater leverage assumed by CSW to
acquire SEEBOARD, a regional electric distribution company located
in Great Britain.

The CSW bid valued SEEBOARD at $2.5 billion, and Moody's said it
finds the additional debt manageable given the good competitive
position of CSW's U.S. utilities, and the generally stable business
outlook for SEEBOARD. But Moody's expects the increased leverage to
put some strain on CSW's cash flow, reducing overall financial
flexibility.

CSW plans to fund the acquisition 60% through nonrecourse bank
debts raised in the U.K., and 40% through an equity contribution
from the U.S. parent corporation. It has negotiated an $850 million
unsecured bank facility to raise funds for the equity contribution.

ELECTRIC FUTURES: NYMEX Looks Forward To Approval

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) expects approval of its
two West coast electric futures contracts by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) this month, and anticipates launching
them before the second half of 1996.

The futures, the first ever for electricity, have the same delivery
terms but one has a delivery point at the California-Oregon border,
while the other is at Palo Verde, Arizona.

Meanwhile, the two proposed electric options contracts, which are
based on the futures contracts, are expected to receive CFTC
approval later in 1996.

DISCOUNT RATES: Vermont Customers to Get Break

Green Mountain Power Corp. (GMP) has asked the Vermont commission
to approve a one-year pilot electric discount program, which would
be available to residential and small business customers who use
more electricity in 1996 than they did in 1995.

The program is aimed at GMP's smaller customers and would provide
a 25% discount on electricity use that exceeds the amount a
customer used during the previous year. The discount would be
limited to 15% of additional electricity use, and customers would
not have to sign up for the program but instead would automatically
qualify.

"Qualifying customers can take advantage of the discount without
increasing the cost to other customers, said GMP President and CEO
Douglas G. Hyde. "That is because there is a surplus of electricity
in new England, and we are giving out customers an opportunity to
take advantage of this unusual energy situation," Hyde added.

NATURAL GAS PIPELINES: Nixed Sale Leads To New Deal

Tenneco Energy (TE) has agreed to sell its 50% interest in the Kern
River natural gas pipeline system to the Williams Companies, Inc.
for $205 million. The companies are joint venture partners in the
Wyoming to California pipeline.

The plan came about after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled
at the end of December that the sale by TE of its 50% interest to
Questar Pipeline could result in market power by Questar in the
Salt Lake City area (see Weekly No. 3235). But the new sale plan
still requires FTC approval.

"Based on discussions with our partner, Williams over the past few
days, we concluded it was in Tenneco's best interest to avoid the
time and expense involved in restarting the bidding process, and go
ahead and finalize the terms of the transaction before year end,"
said Steve Chesebro', TE Chairman and CEO.

LEAST-COST PLANNING: Oregon PUC Finds Idaho Power Reasonable

The Oregon PUC on December 29 acknowledged Idaho Power Co.'s (IP)
least-cost plan, which implements new conservation programs and
system efficiency improvements, continues efforts to relicense its
hydroelectric plants, and continues solar and windpower
development.

PUC acknowledgement of a least-cost plan means that the plan seems
reasonable to the PUC at the time, but favorable ratemaking
treatment is not guaranteed. It gives considerable weight in the
ratemaking process to utility actions that are consistent with
acknowledged plans.

TELEPHONE COMPETITION: Colorado Works On Local Rules

The Colorado PUC is beginning hearings this month on proposed rules
to open the local telephone market to competition beginning July 1.
The proposed rules would implement state legislation passed last
year instructing the PUC to open up local service to competition.

For six months, various working groups have attempted to agree on
interconnection and number potability, resale, high cost funds, 911
services, and certification. Each group drafted a set of proposed
rules, and consensus was reached in the areas of 911 requirements
and certifications. More than one set of proposed rules were
drafted for the other areas, and the PUC need by law only give
substantial deference to those rules where consensus was reached.
The hearings run through March, with an initial decision expected
in early April, and a final decision by May 31.

ELECTRIC COMPETITION: Tribal Choice Causes Lawsuit

Madison Gas and Electric Co. (MGE) on January 3 filed a lawsuit in
court and a complaint at the Wisconsin PSC against Wisconsin Power
& Light Co. (WPL), because WPL will provide electricity to a Native
American tribe's bingo hall to be located in MGE territory (see
Weekly No. 3232).

WPL on December 1, 1995 had won the bid to provide service to the
tribe. Although present state law only allows provision of service
by a certificated utility in its own service territory, the tribe
has raised the argument that it is excluded from the law because it
is a sovereign nation.

In court, MGE has asked for treble actual damages -- lost margins
on electric sales made by WPL. MGE also asked for punitive damages
and award of attorneys' fees. At the PSC, MGE asked it to require
WPL to remove any electric lines and related plant from  MGE's
service territory.

INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATORS: FERC To Hold Technical Conference

The FERC on January 4 announced that as part of its electric
transmission open access NOPR, it would hold a technical conference
on independent system operators (ISO) and reform of power pools
under the federal power act. The conference will be held January 24
at 9:30 A.M. at the FERC.

The FERC said that at its December 5 and 6, 1995 conference on
comparability for power pools, that several speakers had described
proposals for developing ISOs as one method to address full
competition. It wants to (1) define the essential elements and
operational characteristics of an ISO; (2) explore principles to be
used in reforming power pools; and (3) explore utility formation of
ISOs.

Electricity -- Flexible Rates

The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities has approved a new
"market-based" electric tariff for Fitchburg Gas & Electric Co., a
combined electric and gas utility. The new Energy Bank Service
offers rates for new or expanding industrial customers that are
priced competitively with average industrial rates in the United
States.  While the utility had supported the new rate offering as
consistent with the state's restructuring goals of greater customer
choice and access to wholesale market prices, the department
rejected the utility's position that the new discount customers
should be exempted from any specific stranded cost charges in the
future.

According to the company, it currently has no excess capacity and
intends to meet the power requirements for the new service offering
form wholesale markets through short-term contracts of one month or
less.  The department said that utility's proposal deserved
stricter scrutiny than other discount proposals recently approved
for utilities who had extra power to sell. Nevertheless, it found
that revenues would more than offset incremental power costs and
separate fuel procurement and accounting procedures devised by the
utility would allow the department to determine whether the new
service offering affected costs for other ratepayer groups. The
department also directed the company to include in the new tariff
a statement that the structure and design of the new rate might
change as a result of the implementation of a restructuring plan
for the utility. Re Fitchburg Gas and Electric Co., D.P.U. 95-75,
Nov. 30, 1995 (Mass.D.P.U.).

The Missouri Public Service Commission has turned down a request by
Kansas City Power and Light Co., an electric utility, for approval
of a generic tariff for special contract offerings to its large
industrial customers. The proposed service would have allowed the
utility to "flex down" from rates in its established Primary Large
Service tariff in order to meet a competitive threat. The utility
had proposed to limit availability of the discount service to
customers with demands of 1,000 kW or greater who are faced with
competition from other energy suppliers. It would have provided the
service at a rate not less than the greater of 1.3 cents per kwh on
an annual average basis or its annualized incremental cost per kwh.
The commission rejected allegations that special rate contracts
were unlawful and also ruled that the protection of confidential
business information associated with the contracts was within its
authority, but it concluded that a generic tariff for discounts
should be considered as part of an investigation of the utility's
overall rate design. Nevertheless, the commission found that the
type of competition currently facing the utility could require a
"bundled service" offering of the type suggested by the utility. It
also said that an unbundled service offering with a price ceiling
and price floor for each service component might also be necessary
in "preparation for the full range of competition" in the utility's
service territory. Re Kansas City Power and Light Co., Case No. EO-
95-181, Dec. 6, 1995 (Mo.P.S.C.).

Electric Industry Restructuring

The Maine Public Utilities Commission has launched a formal inquiry
into the restructuring of the electric industry in the state. The
state legislature had allotted the commission a one-year period,
beginning on January 1, 1996, to develop at least two plans for the
transition to a competitive retail electric market including: (1)
a plan to achieve full retail market competition by the year 2000
and (2) a plan to achieve retail competition "wherever effective
competition is likely" while maintaining regulation where
necessary. Under the legislative mandate the commission is required
to provide a range of estimates of stranded investment associated
with each restructuring proposal.  the commission seeks comments on
a variety of issues including whether rate decreases can be
expected  and whether retail competition would provide benefits to
consumers that cannot be obtained through enhanced wholesale
competition.  Re Electric Utility Industry Restructuring, Docket
No. 95-462, Dec. 12, 1995 (Me. P.U.C.).

Mergers -- Rate Increases

The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission has turned
back a pre-merger attempt by Puget Sound Power and Light Co. to
make permanent a $165.5 million rate increase allowed under its
periodic rate adjustment mechanism (PRAM), a ratemaking clause
designed to remove disincentives to utility conservation efforts by
"decoupling" revenues from sales levels and instead relying on a
revenue per customer approach to cost recovery. The utility had
earlier agreed to defer a scheduled base rate filing pending review
by the commission of its proposed merger with Washington Energy Co.
The commission said that it had approved the deferral subject to
the utility's agreement to file a rate case by April of 1996 if no
merger application was filed, but that any extension of the PRAM
collections beyond their scheduled expiration on October 1, 1996
would be treated a temporary rates subject to refund. It added that
the utility could choose to file a base rate case at any time
seeking permanent recovery of the PRAM collections. Washington

LECs -- Competition -- Interconnection tariffs

The New York Public Service Commission has ordered New York
Telephone Co., a telecommunications local exchange carrier (LEC),
notify customers of the newly instituted opportunity to choose an
alternative carrier for intraLATA toll calling. Interexchange
carriers in the state had complained about the LEC's plans for
implementation of a recent order by the commission reqiring equal
access for intraLATA toll services. (Prior to the "intraLATA
presubscription" ruling, customers who desired their "local" toll
calls to be carried by an interexchange carrier such as AT&T, MCI,
or Sprint were required to dial special code numbers in addition to
the telephone number.)  The LEC had proposed that in negotiating
new services with customers its representatives would not inform
customers of the rule change or ask customers who they want as
their intraLATA toll carrier. It claimed that to do so would place
it at a competitive disadvantage and increase the cost of
processing new service orders. The commission disagreed with the
carrier finding that while the claims may have some merit, the LEC
had ignored the advantages it possessed in controlling the
telephone order processing function and from beginning the equal
access process with 100% of the presubscribed market. For a
competitive market to develop customers must be informed of
available choices, the commission said. It also noted that without
specific instructions from regulators "irresistible incentives"
would develop to sell the LEC's service unfairly. Re New York
Telephone Co., Case Nos. 28425 et al., Dec. 1, 1995 (N.Y.P.S.C.)

Trimble County Generating Plant -- Rate Disallowance

The Kentucky Public Service Commission has approved an agreement
finally concluding a long standing case governing rate treatment of
the investment by Louisville Gas & Electric in the Trimble county
generating facility. The matter had been before the commission in
one form or another for well over a decade.  In 1989 the commission
determined that 25% of the 495 megawatt coal-fired plant was
disallowed from rate base. Under the approved agreement the utility
will refund current customers $22 million with $5.3 million
reserved to special contract customers and the rest refunded to all
other customers through a per-kwh credit over a five year period.
The utility also agreed to apply an additional $4.5 million to fund
low-income energy assistance programs over the same five-year
period. Commissioner Linda K. Breathitt expressed concern in a
separate concurring opinion over the length of time necessary for
residential customers to receive their refunds while certain
industrial customers would receive immediate payments. She also
noted that the agreement was an example of a recent trends in
settlement agreements presented to the commission where the
utility, its large industrial customers, and low income customers
are the obvious beneficiaries of ardent representation at the
bargaining table while the vast majority of customers appear to
have a much smaller voice in the process. Re Louisville Gas and
Electric Co., Case No. 10320, Dec. 8, 1995 (Ky.P.S.C.).
