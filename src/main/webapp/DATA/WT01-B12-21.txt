 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NEEDS VARY </H2>

<P>  Vitamin C is the most talked about and most studied vitamin.   It naturally reinforces hundreds of defense mechanisms in the body. With the exception of man, almost all other animals are able to manufacture their own. However, we must obtain it from food or supplements.</P>
<P>   Individual needs for Vitamin C vary from person to person and from day to day, according to the types and amount of stress that is experienced.  Dr. Linus Pauling, the world's leader in Vitamin C research, consistently took 6,000 mg per day for years, which he considered to be the absolute minimum, even though the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is only 60 mg per day. Most doctors and scientist agree that we routinely need more since the RDA was determined to be enough to only prevent scurvy.</P>
<P>   Those who live in cities or near busy highways may suffer from carbon monoxide and lead poisoning. In large doses, Vitamin C has been shown to have a protective effect of pulling the carbon monoxide away from the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, so the oxygen can become attached and be carried to the cells.</P>
<P>   Pregnant women who take adequate amounts of Vitamin C have less problem with leg cramps, fluid retention and toxemia.</P>
<P>   It  has  been  proven  that  Vitamin  C  increases  certain biochemical reactions in white blood cells that kill bacteria. There are many bacteria, viruses, and allergies which can be associated in various ways with colds.  Vitamin C does not provide complete protection against all of them. Nonetheless, your odds are probably better while taking it.</P>
<P>   If you smoke one pack of cigarettes a day, you have about 25C/o less Vitamin C in your blood than non-smokers.  Those who drink a lot of alcoholic beverages need Vitamin C, because the liver depends on it to produce an enzyme that helps take alcohol out of the bloodstream. Aspirin depletes the body of Vitamin C and blocks the blood cells from absorbing it. The more exposure to drugs and chemicals, the more Vitamin C is needed to minimize harmful effects.</P>
<P>   Diabetics seem to lack the ability to transport Vitamin C across their cell membranes, which can result in serious blood vessel complications, which is common among diabetics. Dr. George Mann of Vanderbilt University states that "cataracts may be a late consequence of marginal intakes of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), with the diabetic being more prone to cataracts because of their lack of insulin."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLLAGEN</H2>
<P>   Vitamin C is necessary for healthy metabolism of skin and connective tissues. Collagen is the major component of skin and connective tissues in our bodies and is the "glue" that holds our bodies together. It cannot be manufactured without Vitamin C. As long as our tissues have the strength provided by collagen, they are able to resist the invasion of infections. Defective collagen assumes a watery consistency and leaks into the bloodstream. The cells are then easily permeated, and all kinds of diseases can run rampant.</P>
<P>   Dr.  Constance  Leslie  of  Pindersfields  Hospital  in Wakefield, England and many other doctors believe that Vitamin C causes cholesterol to come out of arterial plaque into the blood.  It can then be used by the liver to make bile salts for digestion.</P>
 <P>  The brain has a greater concentration of Vitamin C than most other tissues in the body.  Dr. Pauling proved that insufficient Vitamin C can impair mentality.  There is strong evidence that ascorbic acid helps brain functioning.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CHELATION</H2>
<P>   Studies show that Vitamin C reduces the danger of mercury, cadmium and lead poisoning. With cars emitting at least 500 million pounds of lead into the atmosphere each year, it is estimated that over 200,000 American children are victims of chronic lead poisoning. It is difficult to avoid cadmium. You get it from passive cigarette smoke, white bread, coffee and tea, to name a few sources.  The FDA reported in Science Magazine that Vitamin C protects against cadmium toxicity.</P>
<P>   Vitamin C protects against nitrosamines, cancer causing chemicals that are made in the stomach from nitrates and nitrites in foods like hot dogs, bacon, luncheon meat and smoked fish.</P>
<P>   Thousands and thousands of papers have been published by reliable researchers from all over the world about Vitamin C. We cannot begin to list all the ways our bodies need Vitamin C, but these few things will give you an idea of its importance.</P>
<P>  Life Plus is careful to include a broad spectrum of bioflavonoids in VITA-C-1000-TR, as these substances occur with Vitamin C in nature.  Bioflavonoids are involved with every major metabolic process of the body, and they act synergistically with Vitamin C.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   VITA-C-1000 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE VITA-C-1000</H2>
<P>   There is no generally accepted amount of Vitamin C to take as everyone has different needs. The RDA of only 60 mg is considered way too low and is only the amount necessary to prevent scurvy. However, larger amounts are needed in times of stress. Many experts believe that teenagers should probably take at least 2,000 mg per day, and most adults may do best on a minimum of 4,000 mg per day or more. Don't forget to include other Life Plus products you take that contain Vitamin C in computing your total consumption such as <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>, <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A>, <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> and <A HREF="mcombat.htm">COMBAT</A>.
