<p><strong>From Basic Research to Product Development</strong>
<P>
For PV to grow in domestic and international markets, it's critical that we reduce the cost of the
electricity it generates. We are doing this in three primary ways: by making devices more
efficient, by making PV systems less expensive, and by validating the technology through
measurements, tests, and prototypes. We accomplish these tasks under the program's three main
elements: Research and Development, Technology Development, and Systems Engineering and
Applications. See <a target=_parent href="implement.html">Implementing the Program</a> for more details about these
elements.

Research and Development (R&D)
<P>
For PV to make a significant contribution to the nation's energy resource mix, the
technology must be improved and electricity from PV must become more cost-competitive.
Therefore, at the most basic level, we study and analyze the very materials used in solar cells
and modules.  We work to develop materials, processes, and devices to yield cells and modules
with higher conversion efficiencies, and we carefully measure, model, and evaluate new
concepts with this same goal. (Photo: Jim Yost Photography)

Technology Development
<P>
The next step is to translate laboratory innovations into technical improvements for commercial
products. To this end, we investigate manufacturing technology, module development, and
balance-of-system (BOS) components. Much of this work is performed under the Photovoltaic
Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT) initiative, a close collaboration between our national
laboratories and the U.S. PV industry.  In projects like this, industry funds 50% and more of the
work.

Systems Engineering and Applications
<P>
Even after a technology is in commercial production, we are involved in its development and
refinement. At this stage, we help  industry improve the performance, reliability, and operational
characteristics of its products.  Working with the industry partners, we test and evaluate the
material, mechanical, electrical, and safety characteristics of cells, modules, BOS components,
and complete systems.
