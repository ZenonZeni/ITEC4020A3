<H2>Cabot's Two-Second Indicator</H2>

<P>
When we open the financial section of our newspaper every morning,
we look at one number first. This is the most important number
we look at all day. The smaller that number the better we like
it. And it takes us only two seconds to check it. That's why we
call this new indicator Cabot's Two-Second Indicator!
<P>
This new indicator, unlike any other market timing indicator we
know of, answers the question, &quot;How healthy is the stock
market today?&quot; When you use it, you are simply taking the
temperature of the stock market. All you have to do is glance
in your newspaper and note the number of stocks on the NYSE that
hit new 52-week price lows for the previous day. This single number,
when properly interpreted, will give you a very good idea of the
health of the current stock market.
<P>
Is this indicator perfect? No. No timing indicator is infallible,
and we never expect to find one that's perfect. Nevertheless,
we have found a strong correlation between the number of daily
new lows and the health of the stock market itself. Essentially
we see that as long as the number of daily new lows does not exceed
40, the market is sound and in no danger of falling significantly.

<P>
In sum, the indicator is most helpful during normal markets and
at market tops. But in addition, at market bottoms this indicator
can help you identify the reduced selling that takes place before
the next major market advance.
<P>
As a result of our research, we have been able to divide the stock
market into three distinct categories of varying degrees of strength
or weakness. Here are the categories:
<H4>CATEGORY ONE - A ROBUST MARKET</H4>

<P>
This type of market is the strongest and typically has no days
of 40 or more new lows. Even on market corrections of 100 Dow
points or more, no 40 readings occur. This is an exceedingly healthy
market on a safe footing. When the daily new low readings are
consistently fewer than 40, it's impossible for the stock market
to drop significantly. 
<H4>CATEGORY TWO - A HEALTHY MARKET</H4>

<P>
This type of market, while not as strong as the one identified
above, is nevertheless a healthy market. And it is more typical
of what we see in an advancing market. Sometimes this type of
market can be quite strong and yet interspersed with corrections
that have reasonably short periods (one to twenty days) of 40
or more new lows. In this category the 40 reading doesn't appear
until the market correction has been in force for a few days.
So these occasional pockets of 40 readings are not worrisome.
They occur around the bottom of a normal correction. And the selling
pressures ease rather quickly if the market is basically healthy.
In fact, the subsequent shrinkage to readings of fewer than 40
can be considered a good buying point for stocks.
<H4>CATEGORY THREE - A SICK AND DANGEROUS MARKET</H4>

<P>
Do not underestimate the danger of this market! If you are aware
of only this category and take defensive action when it first
appears, you will be extremely well rewarded. In these cases we
observe that as the market advances to a new market peak or a
sub-peak, the daily new lows start expanding simultaneously to
produce readings of 40 or more, day after day. DANGER, DANGER,
DANGER!!!! Internally, the real market is heading down, producing
a dangerous number of new lows day after day, even though the
Dow is hitting new peaks and even though the daily new highs might
be expanding! A sell signal is flashed as soon as five consecutive
days of readings in excess of 40 new lows are registered. The
Category Three market remains in effect as long as the new lows
remain greater than 40. 
<P>
To conclude that the Category Three decline has truly reached
its end, we like to see a retest of the market bottom with the
daily new lows at reduced levels followed by at least four days
of fewer than 40 new lows in an advancing market.
<H4>REVIEW OF CABOT'S TWO-SECOND INDICATOR</H4>

<P>
Probably the best way for you to understand this indicator is
to look at some history. The detailed comments show you how you
could have spotted each of these new market trends, not in hindsight,
but in real time, as it was developing. You'll find one example
of Category One, one example of Category Two and then eight examples
of Category Three. This is the category of greatest interest because
it helps you to identify market tops as they occur. It warns you
of serious market declines and even of impending market panics
such as the one of October, 1987.
<H4>A ROBUST MARKET<BR>
Category One, 1991</H4>

<P>
1991 was a typically bullish year in which the Two-Second Indicator
repeatedly signaled that the stock market was healthy and there
was nothing to worry about. The new lows remained at fewer than
40 throughout the entire year except for five trading days in
the middle of January when the market was going through a normal
correction, one day in August when Gorbachev of Russia was ousted
for a day, and then in late November and December when the market
was correcting again. (These year-end corrections could be considered
Category Two configurations.) The year 1983 provided us with another
good example of a Category One configuration. In that year, no
new lows in excess of 40 appeared until December, and that was
during a market correction. There were only nine recorded days
of more than 40 new lows in 1983.
<H4>A HEALTHY MARKET<BR>
Category Two, 1992</H4>

<P>
In 1992 the Two-Second Indicator produced readings of less than
40 throughout the year except on 35 trading days. And those 35
trading days occurred during five distinct market corrections.
There were two in April at the bottom of the correction. There
were seven in June, during a correction. Two in July during market
weakness. Two in August during a sell-off. And finally, beginning
in September and extending into November, there was a series of
days of more than 40 new lows (22 days in all). These 40 or more
readings kept appearing and then disappearing during the September-November
market correction. But the new lows never expanded. Ever-so-slowly
they started drying up and then eventually disappeared. This is
a good example of Category Two, a reasonably healthy market that
is frequently interspersed with reasonable market corrections,
none of a damaging nature. You would have been safely and profitably
investing throughout the entire year.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1962</H4>

<P>
In January of 1962 the Dow had just hit record highs of 725 in
the Dow, had corrected and was advancing again in March, just
a handful of points short of the January record highs. The daily
new lows were substantially fewer than 40, without exception.
On March 15 the market peaked at 723. On the 18th, with the Dow
at 720, the daily new lows exceeded 40, and then day after day
kept getting larger and larger. We were witnessing Category Three
unfolding. The market was right at its highs and yet the daily
new lows started expanding. We were able to record five consecutive
days of 40-or-greater readings by the time the market dropped
to 714 in the Dow, on March 25th. This flashed a sell signal.
Fundamentally, there was news to precipitate the weak market that
developed in late March and April. President Kennedy had confronted
the steel industry and forced the steel companies to rescind their
recent price hikes. The stock market took this badly. The Dow
Industrials dropped from 723 to 535 (a huge drop of 26%) in little
more than three months' time.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1966</H4>

<P>
In February of 1966, the Dow Industrials were hitting a new record
high at 995, breaking up through the previous highs of mid-January.
But surprisingly, only one day after that peak, with the Dow slipping
only five points, the new lows expanded to 50 and continued to
expand. That was the first day of a whole series of days until
November, where 97% of all the readings exceeded 40 day after
day. The sell signal was flashed at Dow 973, only six days after
the yearly market high was recorded in mid-February. This was
clearly a Category Three sell signal. The market skidded and dived
throughout the year, dropping from Dow 995 in February to 745
in early October, a drop of 25%. It was a great year to be anywhere
but the stock market!
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1970</H4>

<P>
1970 witnessed the daily new lows expanding rapidly in January,
but not until a correction was well under way (Category Two).
Then, as the market advanced again into early April, the new lows
shrunk, as expected, to below 40, but only briefly, actually for
six days. Then, while the Dow was resting at its market peak of
Dow 790, the new lows started to expand dramatically with the
first reading in excess of 40 occurring four days prior to the
market's ultimate peak. This was a weak situation and spelled
danger for the market. The fifth consecutive reading of excessive
new lows occurred right at the exact market top in mid-April,
producing a market sell signal. This coincided with the liquidity
crisis that occurred at that time. The market plummeted from the
Dow 790 area to 630 in less than two months. That amounted to
a shocking 20% drop. 
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three 1973</H4>

<P>
In 1973, as the Dow hit record highs of 1050 in mid-January, the
daily new lows started expanding and exceeded 40 on the very first
day following that all-time Dow peak. That was a bad sign, indicating
that the market was getting pneumonia. A market sell signal was
flashed at Dow 1000 on January 25, after five consecutive days
were registered. The new lows remained in excess of 40 until September.
In those eight months the market plummeted from Dow 1050 to 853,
for a loss of 19%.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1974</H4>

<P>
In 1974, as the Dow advanced to a new high for the year (in March
at Dow 890) the new lows started to expand and a short four days
after that peak the new lows were 50. This was a bad sign, new
lows expanding to beyond 40 just four days after the peak in the
Dow was being reached. The sell signal was flashed in late March
with the Dow at 870, only 20 points off its peak. These new lows
continued to expand day after day, remaining in excess of 40 until
October. The market was in a shambles. The Dow had collapsed from
Dow 890 to 585 in less than seven months. The Dow drop amounted
to a gigantic 34%. 
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1980</H4>

<P>
In 1980, the big market drop lasted only six weeks, but a lot
of damage was done in that time. However, the daily new lows exceeded
40 for six days <I>before</I> the market top of Dow 900 in mid-February.
The indicator gave a sell signal one day before the market peak.
And the new lows continued to expand day after day. The new lows
finally reached an extreme of 698 at the end of March before drying
up rapidly. The drop in the Dow from 900 to 760 amounted to a
16% plunge.
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1987</H4>

<P>
1987 provided the record market crash of modern times. The year
started out bullishly enough with very few daily new lows for
the first three months. In the April-May market correction, the
new lows expanded beyond 40 just near the bottoms of the several
pullbacks (Category Two). Then the Dow advanced to new all-time
peaks in August to Dow 2722. And the daily new lows looked fine.
We had a normal correction in September where the new lows expanded
to beyond 40. Then the Dow started advancing again, moving up
to 2640 over a period of two weeks. But on this 150-point advance,
as the daily new lows tried to contract to below 40 they failed
to do so, with the exception of one day in early October, just
one day before the peak. Then the new lows exceeded 40 again,
the Dow started dropping, and the new lows started expanding sharply!
After five days, this indicator gave a sell signal. And you had
about six more trading days to act before the crash occurred.
From the October peak of Dow 2640 to the close of 1841 on October
20, we saw a market drop of 30%. The new lows expanded sharply
to a gigantic 1175 on that nightmarish October day. 
<H4>A DANGEROUS MARKET<BR>
Category Three, 1990</H4>

<P>
Before the bear market started in July, there was a Category Two
configuration in January, extending into February. The market
then rallied up to 2760 in mid-April, and this indicator flashed
a sell signal as the new lows persisted at more than 40 for five
straight days. But this signal proved to be premature since the
market strengthened and went ahead to about Dow 2909 in June with
the new lows drying up. Then there was another normal pull back
in late June. But as the market rallied again to a new all-time
peak in July just short of Dow 3000, the daily new lows failed
to shrink from the June correction. They remained in excess of
the 40 level. This was a bad sign, because the Dow was clearly
above its peaks of early June and yet the daily new lows were
running between the 40 and 60 level, a very unhealthy situation.
That was a clear-cut sell signal. The new lows kept expanding
as the market started a correction. Thirteen trading days after
the market peaked (it was down 150 points by then) news arrived
that Iraq had invaded Kuwait. The market rout was under way and
it wasn't until mid-October that the market bottomed at Dow 2360.
Thus, the market drop amounted to 21%, a serious decline. 
<P>
Now, after reviewing these details, you have a better understanding
of how you can use this indicator for more profitable investing.
Of course, no indicator is infallible. That's why we strongly
advise that you use this Two-Second Indicator in conjunction with
Cabot's other indicators, such as the Power Index and the daily
Advance-Decline Line of stocks on the NYSE.

<H4>IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF <BR>
CABOT'S TWO-SECOND INDICATOR</H4>

<P>
1. Every day, it gives you a simple, unbiased reading of the health
of the stock market.<BR>
2. It is extremely broad-based, involving the entire NYSE.<BR>
3. It is a specific reading of what the stock market itself is
doing. It is not some secondary or tertiary indicator, such as
the economy, or interest rates, or employment rates or inflation
rates.<BR>
4. This indicator gives you an ongoing picture of the general
health of the market. When there are no or very few daily lows
in excess of 40, you know it's a robust market. When the daily
new lows begin to exceed 40 in the depths of a market correction,
you know it's still a healthy market, and you should remain invested
or even take advantage of the buying opportunity.<BR>
5. With this indicator, you can identify market tops as they occur.
As a general rule, when the Dow Industrial Average advances strongly
for roughly two weeks to a month to a new peak or a sub-peak and
is accompanied at the top by five continuous days of daily new
low readings in excess of 40, it's a sign of danger ahead in the
stock market. The earlier the five readings occur, the more dangerous
the situation!
