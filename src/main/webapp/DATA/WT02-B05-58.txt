<p>
<p>
Jerry Berman is the Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology 
(CDT) in Washington, DC. CDT is an independent, non-profit public interest policy 
organization whose mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect 
and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital media. The 
Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and 
coalition building. 
<p>
The Center, founded by Jerry Berman, Janlori Goldman, and Daniel Weitzner in 
December 1994, marshals legal, technical, and public policy expertise on behalf of 
civil liberties goals, including:
<ul>
<li>protecting free speech and the free flow of information in on-line and interactive media; 
<li>increasing citizen control over sensitive personal information held by third parties;
<li>securing  communications privacy in a global network environment; 
<li>guaranteeing public access to electronic government information; and
<li>working for network architecture policies that serve universal access and other democratic values. 
</ul>
<p>
Mr. Berman coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group comprised 
of over fifty communications firms, associations and civil liberties groups 
addressing communications privacy policy issues. The group works on such issues 
as the Administration's "Clipper Chip" key escrow encryption scheme and monitors 
the implementation of the recently passed Digital Telephony legislation.
<p>
Mr. Berman also coordinates the Interactive Working Group, an ad-hoc of public 
interest groups, online information service companies, telephone and cable 
companies and broadcasters working on free speech and content regulation issues 
confronting interactive media today.
<p>
Prior to founding the Center for Democracy and Technology, Mr. Berman was the 
Policy Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Until 1988, Mr. Berman was 
Chief Legislative Counsel at the ACLU and founder and director of ACLU Projects 
on Privacy and Information Technology.  Mr. Berman has led coalitions to draft and 
enact such legislation as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986; the Computer Security Act of 1987 
the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988; and the privacy protections in the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994. He has written in 
both scholarly and popular journals on privacy, free speech, and information access 
issues.
<p>
Mr. Berman received his BA, MA, and LLB at the University of California, Berkeley.  
He graduated with honors, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and served as an editor of 
the California Law Review at Boalt Law School.
