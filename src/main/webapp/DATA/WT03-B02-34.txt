Clinton Signs Bill Delaying Over-The-Road Bus Accessibility Under ADA

WASHINGTON -- As the Justice Department considers one amendment to the
ADA, another has already been signed into law by President Clinton. The
National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, signed by the president
on Nov. 28, 1995, delays the date by which over-the-road buses must be
accessible under the ADA.
Original ADA regulations called for large over-the-road carriers such as
Greyhound  to be accessible by July 1996, and smaller carriers by 1997.
Those dates, however, were based on the issuance of Department of
Transportation regulations by July 1994. DOT did not release regulations
by 1994 -- in fact, it still has not.
Congress, therefore, moved to amend the ADA so that large and small
carriers have two and three years, respectively, to comply from whatever
date DOT issues its regulations.
According to Maureen McCloskey, who monitors Congress for Paralyzed
Veterans Association, the ADA amendment was placed into the
transportation bill while it was being debated in the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, chaired by Rep. Bud
Shuster, R-Pa.  The Senate had no ADA provision in its version of the
bill, but Senate officials receded in conference and the bill went to
the president with the ADA provision intact, McCloskey said.
"We're concerned that the disability community was not involved in the
process," McCloskey said. "We had received assurances from both the
minority and the majority that this would not be in the bill. But there
it was."
Disability-rights advocates concede that controversy about accessibility
to over-the-road buses did not cease when the ADA was signed into law in
1990. The Office of Technology Assessment was charged with doing a study
on the best way to provide accessibility to the buses; DOT was to have
based its regulations on the results of the study.
The study, completed in 1993, concluded that each vehicle should be
accessible, whether by a ramp or lift, either vehicle-based or station-
based. The controversy between advocates and bus company officials
simmered as DOT issued its notice of proposed rulemaking in 1994.
According to McCloskey, DOT was considering allowing only a percentage
of buses to be accessible. It also was considering a proposal by bus
companies to use a boarding device, placing a mobility-impaired person
into a regular bus seat and stowing the wheelchair. Advocates prefer
having the wheelchair secured within the bus -- but that tends to take
up more seats and more potential revenue from bus operators, McCloskey
said.
The 1994 deadline passed and DOT didn't issue regulations.
"I understand the bus companies' concern that they have no regulations
to comply with and their statutory deadline is in six months," McCloskey
said. "As far as the ADA being a reasonable law, the extension makes
sense. Other entities had two years after regulations came out to be in
compliance.
"On the other hand, they are the only public entity that hasn't had to
do anything under the ADA. They're being allowed to perpetuate an
inaccessible system. The technology is there. The private buses are
doing it. This is not a technological problem -- it's what the bus
industry is pushing as a financial problem."

WASHINGTON

The Department of Justice has proposed extending the deadline -- by 10
years, in some cases -- for the installation of curb ramps in cities and
towns across the U.S. The surprise announcement was made in a notice of
proposed rulemaking in the Nov. 27, 1995, Federal Register.
If Justice's proposal is realized it would become the most significant
alteration of Americans with Disabilities Act regulations since the
law's passage in 1990. Further, the proposal comes on the heels of
another rollback in ADA regulations that took disability-rights
activists by surprise: In late November President Clinton signed a
transportation bill containing a provision that extended the deadline
for accessibility to over-the-road buses. (Story on page 7.)
Public comment on the curb ramp proposal will be accepted until Jan. 26
-- and there should be plenty of it. For disability-rights advocates,
curb ramps are a basic issue: What good are other accessibility measures
if a person in a wheelchair can't get out of the street? Feelings run
equally deep in municipal governments, where officials say budgets are
being stretched to the limit to comply with this costly unfunded federal
mandate.
The proposed rule would amend Title II regulations to extend the time
period for compliance, to Jan. 26, 2000, for curb ramps serving state
and local government facilities, transportation, places of public
accommodation, other places of employment and the residences of
individuals with disabilities. It would extend the time period for
providing curb ramps at existing pedestrian walkways in other areas to
Jan. 26, 2005.
The proposed rule would not affect a public entity's obligation to
install curb ramps at all newly constructed or altered streets, roads
and highways. (28 C.F.R. Section 35.151(e)) And, public entities that
choose to take advantage of this extension of time must amend their
transition plans to establish specific schedules for meeting the new
deadlines.
What are the current deadlines for curb ramp installation? This has been
a matter of some debate. The provision of curb ramps is linked to the
Title II "program accessibility" standard -- in other words, a public
entity's programs and activities, when viewed in their entirety, must be
readily accessible to persons with disabilities. Title II required
public entities to have achieved program accessibility by Jan. 26, 1992
-- the effective date of Titles II and III. But where structural changes
-- such as curb ramps -- were required for program accessibility, the
ADA provided that such changes be made as expeditiously as possible, but
in no event later than Jan. 26, 1995, unless meeting that deadline would
result in a fundamental alteration of its program or would impose undue
financial and administrative burdens.
That Jan. 26 deadline came and went last year, and most disability-
rights advocates admitted that while some cities had made significant
progress toward full program accessibility, many -- if not most -- had
not. The Department of Justice, in explaining its reasons for proposing
the extension, stated that "it is the Department's hope that this
extension will provide the additional flexibility necessary for state
and local governments to comply with the ADA in light of strained fiscal
resources, and that it will actually increase the number  of curb ramps
that will be installed on this nation's streets." That, too, was the
stated motivation of a group of senators -- former co-sponsors of the
ADA -- who wrote the Department of Justice last year urging it to
consider the revised deadlines.
Justice Department officials could not be reached for further comment
due to the partial shutdown of the federal government, which was ongoing
at presstime.
Maureen McCloskey, who monitors Congress for the Paralyzed Veterans of
America, said members of her organization and the disability community
in general are not pleased by the proposal.
"We're real upset about this," she said. "This directly affects our
members' ability to get around. Local governments had five years since
the ADA was passed. They're not making a ruckus about this; they just
aren't doing anything. And what does this say to the communities that
have complied with the ADA's current provisions?"
Justin Dart, former chairman of the President's Committee on Employment
of People with Disabilities, sums up the arguments on both sides. On one
hand, would an extension of deadlines encourage further non-compliance?
Will further extensions of time be granted after these expire?
Conversely, he also said the revised deadlines are not unlike those
ordered by courts when communities are found to be in violation of the
ADA.
"What will we gain if we defeat the rule change?" he said. "We will
retain the right to sue now. If we sue or threaten to sue every
delinquent community and win, we will probably get court-ordered or
voluntary schedules for compliance that are very similar to the ones
required by the rule change. It will cost money and time. It could, in
some instances, create animosities that become barriers to other agenda
items -- access, programs and funding."
The genesis of the proposal was some of the ADA's staunchest and most
powerful allies in the U.S. Senate: Republican Sens. Bob Dole, John
McCain and Orrin Hatch and Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin and Edward
Kennedy. They sent a letter to the Department of Justice early last
year, stating that "it was our intent to carefully craft ADA to include
fair and balanced provisions and specific safeguards for state and local
governments regarding costs. In this regard, we have heard that curb
cuts are a unique, significant capital expense, and believe that our
intent would be more properly fulfilled over a longer time period."
It had been suggested by some advocates that the proposed rule should
require public entities to establish a formal process through which
individuals with disabilities may request installation of a ramp at
their personal residence -- and that the ramp should be installed within
one year of the request. The Justice Department, however, states that it
"is concerned that the imposition of a requirement to provide curb ramps
at private residences within a year of a request may inhibit the ability
of a public entity to give priority to installing curb ramps on more
heavily traveled routes serving public and commercial facilities."
Justice currently recommends -- but does not require -- the development
of a request procedure. The proposed rule would require public entities
to ensure that curb ramps serving the residences of individuals should
be done by Jan. 26, 2000, and before the construction of ramps at other
residential and non-commercial sites.
The Department of Justice also is seeking comments on:
Costs. Justice is hoping to get beyond anecdotal evidence from state and
local governments and receive specific curb ramp costs, including the
amount of funds used both in terms of gross numbers and percentages of
the city and state budgets.
Transportation. The lack of curb cuts could hamper the move toward
accessible transportation as some bus stops may lack curb ramps for a
longer period of time.

sent to: John L. Wodatch, Chief, Disability Rights Section, Civil Rights
Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Rulemaking Docket 007, P.O. Box

Insurer Refusing to Cover Applicant Because He Is Deaf, Suit Alleges

MINNEAPOLIS -- While most insurance-related ADA suits have so far
focused on disability-based caps or exclusions in coverage provided by
employers, a case here appears to chart new waters: Does an insurer
violate the law if it refuses to write a health insurance policy for an
individual who is deaf?
That's the allegation in a suit filed by James L. Houselog, a 30-year-
old Minnesota man who has been deaf since birth. Houselog was denied
insurance by Continental General Insurance Co. because of his hearing
loss -- even though he has no apparent health problems, said one of his
attorneys, Laura Rovner of the National Center for Law and Deafness in
Washington.
The case has obvious implications for insurers. If Continental's
decision is found to be discriminatory, insurers across the nation could
be forced to re-evaluate their policies on applicants with disabilities.
Employers should keep an eye on the case too, as they are liable if they
offer a policy to employees that is found to be discriminatory.
Access to health insurance has been a long-standing problem for people
with disabilities -- in fact, it was at the top of disability activists'
agenda during the debate for national health care reform in 1994.
However, even staunch disability-rights proponents concede that the ADA
is a civil rights law and not a blueprint for healthcare and insurance
reform. Despite this, ADA suits continue to net favorable settlements
when challenging caps or exclusions in insurance (See Mason Tenders
story on page 1.)
The Minnesota case centers on plaintiff Houselog, a financial consultant
who does not receive health benefits from an employer. He submitted an
application for health and accident insurance to Continental. According
to the suit, the application asked whether he "[e]ver had any
indication, diagnosis or treatment of eyes or ears, including: impaired
sight or hearing?" Houselog answered yes, indicating that he was born
deaf because his mother had rubella while she was pregnant.
According to the suit, Continental denied the application, stating: "In
accordance with our current medical underwriting guidelines, we do
consider applicants with deafness on a substandard basis. Unfortunately,
the state of Minnesota has passed insurance regulation that limits our
ability to offer substandard coverage in Minnesota. Therefore, we are
unable to issue a policy to you." The insurer indicated that it would
have considered Houselog on a "substandard" basis -- in other words, it
would have covered him for only those expenses not related to his
deafness. However, Minnesota recently passed a law forbidding the
writing of substandard policies, Rover said.
"This is the purest form of discrimination," Rovner said. "It's like
racial discrimination; it's like saying we're not going to cover you
because you're black. There is no reason to think that this man, who has
a totally clean health record, would incur any more expenses than a
person who is not deaf."
An official representing Continental declined comment on the case.
Rovner expects the insurer to equate its alleged denial of Houselog's
application to the more common practice of insurers not covering persons
with pre-existing conditions. Rovner also notes that the ADA at 42
U.S.C. Section 12201(c) allows insurers to classify and administer
insurance risks that are consistent with state law.
"The ADA also requires that such a decision be based on actuarial
evidence," Rovner said. "I think their justification is that there is
some kind of actuarial basis that deaf people are a greater risk. But
they haven't presented that to us.
"Plus, they haven't obtained enough information from him to know whether
he's an increased risk. They know that his mother had rubella, that he
was born deaf. The insurance company didn't even get enough information
to know whether he was  totally deaf and therefore wouldn't even need a
hearing aid."
Houselog  asked the Minnesota Department of Commerce to investigate the
alleged denial of insurance. According to the suit, a Continental
official responded to the state inquiry by writing, "Because Mr.
Houselog presented an application with the history of hearing loss, we
were unable to provide a standard policy. We consider applicants with
deafness on a substandard basis."
The state concluded its investigation by informing Houselog that "[i]t
appears that the reply addresses your concerns and answers your
questions. We have closed the file."
Rovner said that, ironically, Minnesota has a law that prohibits the
denial of insurance because of someone's blindness. The law, however,
does not address other disabilities.

the District of Minnesota. Filed November 1995

WASHINGTON

Employment of people with disabilities in the federal government remains
steady despite government-wide downsizing, according to a report just
released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
"It is gratifying to see that while government continues to downsize and
hiring restrictions at many agencies remain in effect, the number of
people with disabilities in the federal executive branch has actually
risen during the Clinton Administration from 6.9 percent in 1990 to 7.4
percent in 1994," said OPM director Jim King.
The office's report will be used to give agencies up-to-date information
to develop strategic affirmative recruiting plans, and for making
informed and cost-effective human resource decisions, according to OPM.
The report names the Department of Veterans Affairs as the largest
employer of persons with disabilities, employing 22,038 people with
disabilities. This represents 8.4 percent of the work force in that
department. About 13 percent of employees with disabilities in the
federal work force are veterans who are eligible for preference because
they served in combat or suffered a service-connected disability, the
report says.
Other agencies with the best records for hiring individuals with
disabilities, according to the report, are the Navy, Army, Air Force,
Agriculture and Treasury.

Mason Tenders Fund Settles Landmark Case

NEW YORK -- Mason Tenders District Council Welfare Fund will pay some $1
million to settle the government's first suit alleging unlawful ADA/HIV
insurance exclusions under the Americans with Disabilities Act. As part
of the settlement, the fund will pay back medical bills and compensatory
damages to workers with HIV or AIDS whose medical expenses were not
covered.
Terrance Donaghey, whose complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in 1992 got the case started, will receive $16,000 for
emotional distress as well as payment for past medical bills. In all,
the fund will compensate more than 10 workers who had filed complaints
with EEOC and also invite other plan members to file claims if they feel
they have been discriminated against.
The landmark settlement -- believed to be the largest yet in an
insurance exclusion case -- brings to a close the government's first
suit alleging "disability-based distinctions" under the ADA. From the
EEOC's perspective, it emphasizes to employers and insurers that
disability-based distinctions are illegal unless they can be justified.
Government regulations issued just days before Mason Tenders was sued in
1993 state that the so-called distinctions are illegal under the ADA
unless proven by actuarial evidence.
The fund, which provides health benefits to thousands of construction-
related workers in New York, amended its plan in 1991 to, among other
things, exclude coverage for expenses relating to HIV and AIDS. Union
officials had said the decision was prompted by rapidly rising health
care costs and a construction downturn related to the recession of the
early 1990s.
Nevertheless, the EEOC made the elimination of disability-based
distinctions a priority in its ADA enforcement and chose Mason Tenders
as its first target. EEOC went on to sue numerous other funds that had
excluded AIDS or HIV, but  just about all of those cases settled.
"The fact is that when the insurers were told they would have to justify
their denial of coverage, settlements came pretty quickly," said Cary
LaCheen of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, who represented
Donaghey in his private suit against Mason Tenders. "They don't fight
these cases indefinitely."
But Mason Tenders -- unlike most of the other funds sued by EEOC ----
appeared prepared to fight back. Many thought the case would eventually
go to the U.S. Supreme Court and resolve the murky interplay between the
ADA and insurance. While the case never made it to the high court, it
did yield an important decision at the district court level. There, the
fund's motion for summary judgment was denied when a judge held that it
was a covered entity under the ADA -- even though it didn't fit the
typical definition of employer under the act. The judge held that the
fund must justify its exclusions by a sound actuarial basis. (See box on
page 11.)
"The most significant part of the Mason Tenders case, in addition to the
settlement, is the earlier ruling that the plan was covered under the
ADA," LaCheen said. "That was instrumental in leading to the settlement
of this case and probably affected other settlements as well."
The judge's oral opinion -- which was never issued in written form --
relied on a broad interpretation of "employer" in a 2nd Circuit case,
Spirt v. Teachers Insurance Annuity Association, which was brought under
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC, in its interpretive
guidance of ADA regulations, provides that the term "employer" has the
same meaning under ADA as it does under Title VII.
In a brief filed in opposition to the fund's motion for summary
judgment, the EEOC also cited the Spirt case: "In Spirt, a tenured
university professor sued the independent insurance company and pension
fund that managed the university's retirement fund to challenge under
Title VII their use of sex-based mortality tables to compute lower
annuity payments for female retirees. Although the professor was not an
employee [of the insurance company or the fund] in any commonly
understood sense, the court of appeals held that the defendants, which
exist solely for the purpose of enabling universities to delegate their
responsibility to provide retirement benefits for their employees, are
so closely intertwined with those universities ... that they must be
deemed an employer for purposes of Title VII."
The Mason Tenders judge accepted EEOC's argument that the fund, too,
exists solely for the purpose of enabling contributing employers to
delegate their responsibility to provide health benefits for their
employees.
"These settlements send a clear signal to other insurers that they
cannot discriminate on the basis of disability," LaCheen said. "People
with disabilities should come forward and file complaints with EEOC
about disability discrimination in insurance they receive through work.
You don't need a lawyer to file a complaint."
Attorneys representing the Mason Tenders fund did not return phone calls
seeking comment on the case. EEOC officials could not be reached for
comment due to the partial government shutdown, which was ongoing at
press time.

In Settling Suit, City Agrees to Accelerate Installation of Curb Ramps

PHILADELPHIA -- The proposed deadline extension for the installation of
curb ramps appears to have come too late for the city. Then again,
perhaps that's not surprising. No other major city in the nation has
been the target of more litigation concerning the accessibility of its
streets and sidewalks under ADA's Title II.
Last year the city appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court a
lower court ruling that said it must construct curb ramps on all streets
it resurfaced since Jan. 26, 1992 -- the effective date of Title II.
The high court declined to review the 3rd Circuit case, Kinney v.
Yerusalim, 4 NDLR Paragraph 278 (3rd Cir. 1993).
And just last month, in settling a suit brought by 20 persons with
mobility impairments, the city agreed to adopt a new transition plan and
accelerate its schedule for curb ramp installation citywide. Under the
new plan, the city will install curb ramps on virtually all
intersections within the Center City district by Dec. 31, 1996. The plan
also calls for the city to install curb ramps throughout all
Philadelphia by Dec. 31, 2001 -- nine years earlier than stated in the
city's pre-lawsuit transition plan.
The proposed settlement agreement will not become effective unless it is
approved by a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania. A hearing is scheduled later this month.
Persons with mobility impairments sued the city last year, alleging that
its transition plan for installing curb ramps did not give priority to
streets near state and local government offices and facilities,
transportation, places of public accommodation, and employers -- as is
required by ADA regulations at 28 C.F.R. Section 35.150(d)(2). The plan
did not identify any specific priorities nor did it identify  the date
by which curb ramps would be installed, according to the suit.
Title II regulations required all public entities to set a transition
plan -- by January 1992 -- for areas where structural changes to
existing facilities were required to comply with the ADA. In addition to
establishing a plan to install curb ramps at existing facilities, the
ADA at 28 C.F.R. Section 35.151(e) requires that all newly constructed
or altered streets must contain curb ramps.
City officials could not be reached for comment on the settlement
agreement. However, when the suit was filed last year, officials said
the city was making progress on the curb ramp project, which it said
would take 10 years and $100 million to complete. Plaintiffs' attorney
Stephen Gold said the city had spent only $1 million installing curb
ramps over the last three years.
As part of the settlement agreement, the city will provide plaintiffs
with annual status reports containing detailed information about its
compliance with the new transition plan. Plaintiffs may remedy any
violations through motions to enforce the agreement if resorting to a
dispute resolution process proves unsuccessful.
Gold said the Justice Department's proposal to extend the curb ramp
deadline should have no effect on this case.

UPDATE

CLEVELAND -- A football fan who is hearing-impaired has failed to
convince the 6th Circuit that the National Football League is violating
the ADA when it "blacks out"  local TV broadcast of home games that are
not sold out 72 hours before game time. Thomas Stoutenborough was
appealing a district court's decision to grant the NFL's motion to
dismiss. In essence, Stoutenborough alleged that the blackout unlawfully
discriminates against persons with hearing impairments because they have
no other way to access the game. Thus, they are denied the
"substantially equal" access that they claim the ADA requires. The
appeals court, however, ruled that the blackout rule is not
discriminatory because it applies equally to the hearing-impaired  and
non-hearing-impaired population. The court also called "irrelevant" the
fact that hearing individuals may be able to listen to a blacked-out
game on radio. The NFL blackout rule does not affect radio broadcasts,
according to the court.
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has announced two settlements
involving restaurants. In northern Michigan, the owner of the well-known
Bear Lake Tavern agreed to make its restrooms accessible to persons with
disabilities. The settlement stems from a civil suit filed by the
department against owner James O. Moyes, who allegedly refused to make
the restaurant more accessible. In addition to altering restrooms, the
restaurant installed a ramp at the entrance, designated two accessible
parking spaces and lowered the public telephone. Moyes also agreed to
pay undisclosed damages. In Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., the Raindancer
Restaurant built a ramp and made its restroom accessible. Two
complainants also received $900 worth of gift certificates for meals at
the restaurant.
CHICAGO -- The Chicago Cubs professional baseball team has agreed to
make major renovations at Wrigley Field to bring the 83-year-old stadium
into compliance with ADA's Title III.  An elevator to the stadium's
terrace level will be installed, more than doubling the number of
reserved accessible seats. Cubs officials also agreed to correct alleged
deficiencies in Wrigley's washrooms and concession stands. Accessible
parking also will be expanded. The Cubs were sued by the Legal Clinic
for the Disabled last year after people with disabilities filed
complaints. The settlement agreement was finalized just two months
before a trial was set to begin. Under terms of the agreement, Cubs
management has until April to make the stadium accessible under the ADA.
The Cubs also agreed to publish a brochure describing the facilities and
arrangements made for persons with disabilities. Finally, the club will
pay Legal Clinic for the Disabled $20,000, which includes a
reimbursement to plaintiffs for the costs of the suit.
