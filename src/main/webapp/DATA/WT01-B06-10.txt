Before Eagen, C. J., and O'Brien, Roberts, Nix,
Manderino, Larsen, and Flaherty, JJ.  


<p>Roberts, Justice

<p>   At common law a lessee who had never entered into possession of his
leasehold was prohibited from bringing an action in ejectment to gain
possession.  The issue before us is the continued validity of this
rule.  We are satisfied by considerations of reason and fairness and
by the weight of modern case law that the ancient rule now serves no
useful purpose, and, accordingly, we refuse to permit its continued
use.

<p><center>

 </center>  

<p>   On August 15, 1951, George and Mary Beech leased property they owned in
Allegheny County to appellee Sun Oil Company for a term of fifteen years with
two additional five-year options.  The lease was recorded.  In 1956 George and
Mary Beech conveyed the property to appellee James Beech.  The lease to Sun Oil
was not affected.

<p>   On September 17, 1962, appellee James Beech and his wife leased the
same property to appellants Joseph and Violet Soffer for a fifty-year
term.<a name="F1_1"><a href="#FN1_1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a>  This lease specifically recited that it was
``subject to'' the prior lease to Sun Oil.  <a name="F1_2"><a href="#FN1_2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> This lease was also recorded.
 

<p>      In July of 1974, as Sun Oil's term was approaching an end, James
Beech and Sun Oil executed what they styled an ``amendment and
ratification'' to the original 1951 lease.  This ``amendment and
ratification'' would allow Sun Oil, at its option, to remain in
possession until at least 1997.<a name="F1_3"><a href="#FN1_3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a>

<p>   In March of 1976, the Soffers sent written notice to Sun Oil of
their intention to take possession on October 1, 1976, the expiration
date of Sun Oil's original fifteen year lease plus the original
options.  Sun Oil replied that it would remain in possession under the
provisions of the 1974 ``amendment and ratification.''

<p>   The Soffers then filed this ejectment action against Sun Oil and
James Beech in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.  The
complaint asserted that the ``amendment and ratification'' constituted
a cancellation of the existing 1951 lease and that the Soffers were
entitled to possession of the property and damages of $ 240 a month
from January 1, 1975, the effective date of cancellation.

<p>   Sun Oil responded by raising a single preliminary objection, which
is the subject of this appeal.<a name="F1_4"><a href="#FN1_4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> Sun Oil asserted
that the Soffers' complaint failed to state a cause of action in
ejectment because it did not allege that the Soffers had ever entered
into possession of the property and were thereafter ousted.  Sun Oil
claimed that the complaint could not be amended to include such an
allegation and, therefore, that the complaint should be dismissed
without leave to amend.  The trial court sustained Sun Oil's objection
and dismissed the complaint.  On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed
without opinion.  This Court then granted allowance of appeal.

<p>   It has never been doubted that a tenant who has been in possession
of his leasehold but who is subsequently ousted may bring an action in
ejectment to regain possession for the duration of his term.  He may
do so whether the wrongful possessor is his landlord or a third party.
13 Stnd.Pa.Prac. Ch. 67, &#167; 35 (1957).  Indeed, ejectment was
originally developed as a remedy for tenants wrongfully dispossessed
of their estates.  <em>Dice</em> v. <em>Reese,</em> 342 Pa. 379, 385, 21
A.2d 89, 92 (1941); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 199.  We are
faced today only with the question of whether a lessee who has never
been in possession but who is entitled to immediate possession, should
be permitted the same remedy.<a name="F1_5"><a href="#FN1_5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a>
 

<p>   The common law originally denied ejectment to the lessee who had
never been in possession.  And a handful of cases in this
Commonwealth, most of them now musty with age, have acknowledged this
restriction.  The trial court, in dismissing the Soffers' complaint,
relied on the two most recent of these cases, <em>Barnsdall</em> v.
<em>Bradford Gas Co.</em>, 225 Pa. 338, 74 A. 207 (1909) and <em>Dime Bank
and Trust Company of Pittston</em> v. <em>Walsh</em>, 143 Pa.Super. 189, 17
A.2d 728 (1940). In Barnsdall this Court noted the existence of the
rule that a lessee could not maintain ejectment prior to entry.
Barnsdall, however, distinguished the rule and upheld an ejectment
action by a lessee of mineral rights who had never entered into
possession.

<p>   In <em>Dime Bank</em> the Superior Court followed the rule and
elaborated on its history:
<blockquote>
    ``The court below . . . held, and in our opinion correctly,
that as plaintiff had only a leasehold interest in the lot of land,
and had never entered into possession, it could not bring ejectment to
obtain possession.  The history of the action of ejectment given in
Blackstone's Commentaries (Book III, pp. 199-206) shows that a tenant
for years must have been in possession under his lease and been ousted
before he can bring ejectment.  In fact, a lessee did not become a
tenant for years, until after he entered `by force of the lease':
Littleton's Tenures (Edited by Wambaugh), Book I, chap. VII, p. 26.''
</blockquote> 
143 Pa.Super. at 195, 17 A.2d at 731 (emphasis in original).  We do
not question the Superior Court's recitation of the early history of
the rule.  But the mere recitation of the rule's history does not
explain its present use nor does it justify its continued application.
Indeed, a review of the historical development of the action of
ejectment indicates that the common law rule requiring prior entry by
a lessee is inconsistent with the modern scope of the writ and with
our modern conception of landlord and tenant relations.

<p><center>
   III
</center>

<p>   The legal action of ejectment began not as a real property action,
but as an action in trespass.  <em>Seitzinger</em> v. <em>Ridgway</em>, 9
Watts 496 (1840). Ejectment originally rested on a claim of actual or
constructive ouster of the plaintiff.  13 Stnd.Pa.Prac. Ch. 67, &#167; 1
(1957).  Entry by the lessee and subsequent ouster by the defendant
were essential to the claim of trespass.

<p>   The writ of ejectment, however, has changed dramatically in the
centuries since its narrow origin.  Today, the right to possession is
the central element of the action---not the claim of ouster.  The writ
of ejectment has long been the general method for obtaining possession
of real property.  <em>Dice</em> v. <em>Reese</em>, 342 Pa. 379, 384-86,
21 A.2d 89, 92-93 (1941); <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Hoffman</em>, 319 Pa. 8,
16-17, 179 A. 41, 45 (1935). The writ has expanded from a tenant's
remedy and has long since been available to fee claimants and all
others who assert the right to possession of estates in real property.
See <em>Gilberton Coal Co.</em> v. <em>Schuster</em>, 403 Pa. 226, 228,
169 A.2d 44, 45 (1961).<a name="F1_6"><a href="#FN1_6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a> Yet it has
never been suggested that a fee claimant need allege entry and ouster
in order to succeed in ejectment.  Rather, our cases involving fee
claimants speak only of the right to possession by one not presently
in possession.  See e. g., <em>Brennan</em> v. <em>Shore Bros.,
Inc.</em>, 380 Pa. 283, 285, 110 A.2d 401, 402 (1955); <em>Bruker</em> v.
<em>Carlisle Borough</em>, 376 Pa. 330, 334-35, 102 A.2d 418, 420
(1954).
 

<p>   Nevertheless, the growth of ejectment to provide a general remedy
for the recovery of estates in realty did not extend to lessees who
had never been in possession.  In all likelihood this was because at
common law a lessee who had not entered into possession was not
thought to have an estate in land.  Rather, such a lessee was said to
have an ``interesse termini,'' or an interest in a term.
Coke. Litt. 46b; 2 Blackstone, Commentaries * 144.  Whatever the
original usefulness of this distinction may have been, we see no
reason why it should continue to prevent a lessee from maintaining an
action in ejectment.<a name="F1_7"><a href="#FN1_7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a>
 

<p>   Even fifty years ago the rule requiring prior entry was correctly
viewed as a remnant of an earlier age.  Speaking of precisely the rule
we review today, one federal court of appeals then observed:
 <blockquote>
``These things relate to a far-distant past.  They are strangers to
the jurisprudence of the United States.  The modern tendency of
jurisprudence is to look through shadows to substance---to eliminate
technicalities in the interest of substantial justice.  It is no
longer necessary to go upon land as in the days of old and receive a
twig or a clod of dirt as a token of changed possession.  . . . In the
more modern doctrine of ejectment, entry is not a prerequisite to the
action, and if the lessee has such interest in the property as gives a
present right of possession, it is immaterial whether he has entered
 into possession before bringing the action.  The right of
entry, not the entry  itself---the right of possession, not
actual possession---are the essentials of an action in ejectment.''
 </blockquote>
<em>Ewert</em> v. <em>Robinson</em>, 289 F. 740, 750-51 (8th Cir. 1923). 
The notion that prior possession by a lessee is necessary to trigger
the right of possession is a legal fiction unrelated to our more
modern view of a lessee's contractual rights.  See <em>Pugh</em> v.
<em>Holmes</em>, 486 Pa. 272, 405 A.2d 897 (1979) (opinion by Larsen,
J.); <em>id</em>., 486 Pa. at 298-299, 405 A.2d at 910 (Roberts, J.,
joined by Nix and Manderino, JJ., concurring) (holding landlord and
tenant's obligations mutually dependent); see also <em>Albert
M. Greenfield & Co., Inc.</em> v. <em>Kolea</em>, 475 Pa.  351, 380 A.2d
758 (1977) (relieving tenant of obligation to pay rent when premises
destroyed by fire).  We refuse to afford a lessee entitled to
possession by virtue of his lease lesser protection than that given a
fee claimant seeking possession.

<p><center>

<p>   By making ejectment available to lessees before entry, we adopt the
view of modern authority.  As stated in 49 Am. Jur.2d <em>Landlord
and Tenant</em> &#167; 220 (1970): <blockquote> ``It seems now generally
agreed that ejectment will lie in favor of the lessee against the
third person, even before entry on the demised premises by the
lessee.''  </blockquote> Accord, Tiffany, 1 The Law of Real Property
&#167; 86 (3d ed. 1939) (and cases cited); 51C C.J.S. <em>Landlord and
Tenant</em> &#167; 314 (1968) (and cases cited).  This is also the result
reached by modern decision, see, e. g., <em>Leader</em> v.
<em>Joyce</em>, 271 Minn. 9, 135 N.W.2d 34 (1965); <em>Wright</em> v. <em>Irving
Trust Co.</em>, 70 F.2d 245, 246 (2d Cir. 1934) (L. Hand,
J.).<a name="F1_8"><a href="#FN1_8"><sup><fontsize=-2>8</font></sup></a></a>
 

<p>      We should not hesitate, in any event, to abolish a rule of law
when its basis has disappeared.  Holmes, <em>The Path of the Law</em>,
10 Harv. L. Rev. 457 (1897); Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial
Process 150-51 (1921).<a name="F1_9"><a href="#FN1_9"><sup><fontsize=-2>9</font></sup></a></a> In recent
times this Court has been alert to reject other out-dated rules which
were no longer in accord with contemporary experience and policy.
<em>Ayala</em> v. <em>Phila. Board of Public Education</em>, 453 Pa. 584, 
603-606, 305 A.2d 877, 886-88 (1973) (abrogating governmental
immunity) (and cases cited); see, e. g., <em>Commonwealth</em> v.
<em>McCusker</em>, 448 Pa. 382, 292 A.2d 286 (1972) (rejecting rule that
psychiatric evidence is inadmissible in murder prosecution for
purposes of determining whether defendant had acted in heat of
passion); <em>Falco</em> v. <em>Pados</em>, 444 Pa. 372, 282 A.2d 351
(1971) (abrogating parental immunity); <em>Reitmeyer</em> v.
<em>Sprecher</em>, 431 Pa. 284, 243 A.2d 395 (1968) (rejecting prior
limitation on landlord's liability for defective conditions);
<em>Flagiello</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania Hospital</em>, 417 Pa. 486, 208 
A.2d 193 (1965) (abrogating charitable immunity).
 

<p>      Indeed, as this Court observed long ago in the specific context
of enlarging the scope of the writ of ejectment: <blockquote> ``Many
other alterations have taken place; and the same authority which
brought it thus far, may certainly carry it to a higher degree of
perfection, as experience happen to show inconveniences, or defects.''
</blockquote> <em>Boyd</em> v. <em>Cowan</em>, 4 Dall. 138, 140 (1794). We
are convinced that the rule we review today does not meet current
societal and jurisprudential needs.  The common law rule now stands as
an unfair barrier to justice and we therefore abolish it.  We hold
that a lessee entitled to present possession of his leasehold may
bring ejectment regardless of whether he has previously entered into
possession.

<p>   The order of the Superior Court is reversed, the order of the Court
of Common Pleas of Allegheny County is vacated and this case is
remanded to the court of common pleas for proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

<p>Manderino, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_1"></a><a href="#F1_1">1</a></b>   The 1962 agreement leased the property to the Soffers
and another couple.  The other couple has since assigned their
interest to appellants.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_2"></a><a href="#F1_2">2</a></b>  The relevant
paragraph of this lease provided: 

<p>``This lease is subject to a prior lease given on the said premises by
George V. Beech and Mary J. Beech, his wife, to the Sun Oil Company,
dated August 15, 1951, for a period of fifteen (15) years, plus right
in the lessee, to two five-year extensions, which said lease has been
assigned by George V. Beech to James L. Beech.  It is understood and
agreed that the lease herein made is subject to all the terms and
provisions of the said lease of August 15, 1951, and that during the
term of the said lease of August 15, 1951, and any extensions thereof,
rentals shall be payable by the Sun Oil Company directly to the said
James L. Beech.  In such case the second parties shall be relieved of
any obligation under the within lease until the expiration of the said
Sun Oil Company lease.''

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_3"></a><a href="#F1_3">3</a></b>  This instrument declared that
the 1951 lease was ``in full force and effect,'' and then provided for
six automatic five-year renewal periods, any of which Sun Oil could
cancel on 180 days written notice.  At the conclusion of these
renewals the lease was to continue from year to year, with 120 days
written notice required of either party in order to terminate.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_4"></a><a href="#F1_4">4</a></b>  Appellee James Beech filed an
answer denying that his 1962 agreement with the Soffers, styled
``LEASE,'' was in fact a lease, and denying that the Soffers were
entitled to either possession or damages.  These issues are not before
us on this appeal, and we express no view on them.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_5"></a><a href="#F1_5">5</a></b>  As recited above, appellants'
complaint alleges that the ``amendment and ratification'' agreement
between James Beech and Sun Oil worked a cancellation of the prior
lease, and, therefore, that appellants became entitled to immediate
possession on January 1, 1975.  Sun Oil has not challenged this claim
and the issue is not before us.  For purposes of this appeal we
assume, without deciding, that appellants were entitled to immediate
possession at the time they filed their complaint.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_6"></a><a href="#F1_6">6</a></b>  The statutory basis for ejectment in
force at the time this case arose declared in sweeping language that
the writ ``shall issue in all cases where lands, tenements or
hereditaments are claimed . . .'' Act of April 13, 1807, P.L.  296,
&#167; 1, 12 P.S. &#167; 1514.  This section has subsequently been repealed by
Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, &#167; 2(a), effective June 27, 1978 and
was replaced by 42 Pa.C.S.A. &#167; 1722(a)(1) which gives this Court
authority to prescribe and modify general rules governing practice and
procedure.

<p>   Because the writ of ejectment was not a real property action, but
originally was an action in trespass, it was not subject to the
hypertechnical pleading rules which surrounded the common law real
actions.  This in part was responsible for the growth and popularity
of ejectment.  See generally Holdsworth, 7 History of English Law 4-10
(1926).  Fee claimants seeking to take advantage of this simple means
of determining title to realty, soon developed methods for using the
writ.  By a series of paper leases and fictitious claims they were
able to frame their dispute to fit within the original pattern of the
ousted tenant's cause of action.  As Blackstone characterized it, the
method ``entirely depends upon a string of legal fictions; no actual
lease is made, no actual entry by the plaintiff, no actual ouster by
the defendant; but all are merely ideal, for the sole purpose of
trying the title.'' 3 Blackstone, Commentaries * 203.  By the
seventeenth century this procedure had become so common that the
English courts instituted reforms calculated to allow these claims
without such contrivances.  This was the beginning of the writ of
ejectment as it exists today.  It is ironic indeed that courts, in
their willingness to determine title to property, have knowingly
accepted wholly fictitious claims of lease, entry and ouster, but have
been unwilling to provide a remedy to actual lessees, such as the
Soffers, who do not make these fictitious claims.

<p>   We note that our rules of civil procedure have abandoned the
historic system of pleading in ejectment in favor of the more
straight-forward assumpsit rules, Pa.R.C.P. 1051-1058.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_7"></a><a href="#F1_7">7</a></b>  In <em>St. Vincent's Roman Catholic
Cong. of Plymouth</em> v. <em>Kingston Coal Co.</em>, 221 Pa. 349, 70
A. 838 (1908) this Court held that a lease for twenty-one years or
more, if properly recorded, vests an estate for years in the lessee
and not simply an interesse termini.  This result was based on the
Court's construction of certain provisions of our recording act, still
in effect today, Act of May 28, 1715, 1 Sm.L. 94, &#167; 5, 21 P.S. &#167; 471
(1955 and Supp.1979).  We note that the Soffers' complaint alleges a
lease for more than twenty-one years and proper recording.  This would
vest the Soffers with an estate for years and not an interesse
termini.  But whatever this distinction may mean in other contexts, we
expressly refuse to make the availability of ejectment turn on such
niceties.  There is little to explain even the original usefulness of
the common law distinction between an estate for years and an
interesse termini; it has been rejected by text-writers who have
called it ``difficult to comprehend,'' Tiffany, 1 The Law of Real
Property 132 (3d ed. 1939), and it has been abolished by statute in
England, Law of Property Act of 1925 &#167; 149(1).  We refuse to use the
concept now to create an artificial barrier to the remedy of
ejectment.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_8"></a><a href="#F1_8">8</a></b>  The Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord and
Tenant &#167; 6.1 (1976) is intended to apply to situations where a tenant
is deprived of possession or use of his leasehold by the landlord or
by action attributable to him.  This section allows the tenant to
terminate his lease or continue the lease and recover damages, abate
rent, use rent to eliminate the interference or withhold rent and
place it in escrow.  Comment b to this section makes it clear,
however, that other relief may also be available:
<blockquote>
   ``b. Unauthorized possession or conduct.  An unauthorized
possession of all or any part of the leased property by the landlord,
or someone whose conduct is attributable to him, is an eviction of the
tenant that could be cured by the tenant himself.  The rule of this
section does not require him to take legal steps available to him to
eliminate the eviction, although that option is open to him.''
</blockquote>

<p>   Companion section 6.2, applicable when the tenant is deprived of
possession by a third party, expressly adopts the view that a ``tenant
may recover the possession of the leased property from the third party
improperly in possession.''

<p>   The Illustrations to both of these sections make clear that the rules of the
Restatement are not limited to situations where the tenant previously has been
ousted.  See, e. g., &#167; 6.1, Comment c, Illustration 7; &#167; 6.2, Comment b,
Illustration 2.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN1_9"></a><a href="#F1_9">9</a></b>  In The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.
L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897), Justice Holmes remarked: ``It is revolting
to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid
down in the time of Henry IV.  It is still more revolting if the
grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the
rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.''
