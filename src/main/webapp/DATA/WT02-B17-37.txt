<h2>ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES</h2>
<p>
A selected applicant under this solicitation could receive DOE funding 
support for the following types of activities.  This list is not intended 
to include all eligible activities related to near-term 'niche' markets 
or mid- to long-term energy markets.  Typical activities may include:
<p><dl>
        Hydrogen production activities, such as thermal processes, 
electrolysis, or photolysis,
        or any other near-term 'niche' production activities.<p>

        Hydrogen storage activities, such as physical or chemical 
storage, or any other near-
        term 'niche' storage activities. <p>

        Hydrogen utilization activities, such as electrochemical or 
combustion processes, or
        any other near-term 'niche' utilization activities. <p>

        Hydrogen transport technologies to provide a transition from the 
current,
        conventional energy transport methods to hydrogen-based energy 
markets. <p>

        Any combination of the technology areas to achieve an integrated, 
commercial system
        for near-, mid-, or long-term hydrogen applications.</dl><p>
