<title>The Growth of Renewables Depends on Several Factors</title>

<H2><I>C. </I>The Growth of Renewables Depends on Several Factors</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
Several factors affect renewable electricity development, including:<BR>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     Prices of competing fuels, especially natural 
gas</B></I>. The current and forecasted price of natural gas and other 
fossil fuels will continue to influence the business climate for 
renewables, affecting utility power purchases, the competitiveness of 
renewables in bidding solicitations, and the availability of private 
investment capital and government support. Deploying renewables has high 
up-front capital costs, but typically extremely low operating costs 
because there are no fuel costs. On a life-cycle basis, renewables often 
have lower costs.<a href="#309" name="r309"> [ 309 ] </a>Nevertheless, at present, natural gas beats 
renewables on a first-cost, short-term basis. Modular natural gas 
facilities currently produce electricity at around 3 cents per 
kilowatt-hour, or less. Although fossil prices, including natural gas 
prices, will inevitably rise, it is uncertain when.<a href="#310" name="r310"> [ 310 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     Evolving electric power regulation</B></I>. Because 
renewables have difficulty competing with natural gas on a first-cost 
basis, regulatory treatment is critical to the future development of 
renewable electricity. Legislative incentives and regulatory policies 
favoring renewables have been responsible for the bulk of purchase 
contracts awarded to renewable electricity developers to date. Just ten 
states have accounted for more than 70 percent of U.S. renewables 
development (excluding hydropower development by utilities), which shows 
the importance of state utility regulatory policy.<a href="#311" name="r311"> [ 311 ] </a>P>
<B><I> <p>     Environmental externalities</B>.</I> A key question in 
the utility industry restructuring debate is whether, or how, the price of 
fossil fuels will be adjusted to account for the environmental and social 
costs associated with their extraction and combustion. At present, these 
externalities are not fully incorporated into market prices. Since 
renewable electricity technologies consume less water and generate much 
less air pollution, hazardous waste, and carbon dioxide emissions, they 
would see wider use in markets that internalize the environmental costs of 
energy production. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 
as of early 1994, 29 states and the District of Columbia required electric 
utilities to consider environmental externalities in their resource 
planning processes. Seven of these states - California, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon and Wisconsin - have developed 
monetary values for pollutant emissions. The momentum toward quantifying 
and incorporating the costs of environmental externalities, however, has 
recently stalled.<a href="#312" name="r312"> [ 312 ] </a>P>
<B><I> <p>     Future Cost Curves of Renewables.</I> </B>Further cost 
reductions could greatly enhance the market penetration of renewables. 
Reductions in the price of renewables are dependent, however, on the 
willingness and the ability of private industry, the federal government, 
and electric utilities to continue to fund technological research, 
demonstration, and commercialization programs. Regulatory uncertainty and 
overcapacity in the market have slowed needed investments in renewables, 
while Congress is scrutinizing the U.S. DOE's budget and is even 
considering abolishing the department altogether.<a href="#313" name="r313"> [ 313 ] </a>P>
<B><I> <p>     Foreign Competition. </B></I>Although the United States 
has pioneered most renewable electricity technologies, the foreign rate of 
development for these technologies is beginning to surpass the U.S. 
pace.<a href="#314" name="r314"> [ 314 ] </a>If the U.S. market continues to be inhospitable, it may force 
renewables development overseas. If the United States fails to develop 
aggressively its own renewables market through public incentives, the 
future U.S. energy infrastructure could become dominated by foreign 
firms.<BR>

<P><A NAME="309"  HREF="#r309">309.</a> Wind project developers have been signing contracts to deliver 
electricity at prices as low as 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in a contract's 
first year, and wind developer Zond Systems just signed a contract for 3 
cents per kilowatt-hour levelized over 30 years. Geothermal and 
small-scale hydro plants can produce electricity for between 4.5 and 7 
cents per kilowatt-hour. Even the more expensive photovoltaics systems 
(which convert sunlight to electricity) have seen costs fall to around $7 
a watt for grid-connected systems, down from $30 a watt for experimental 
systems in the early 1980s, and now produce electricity for between 25 and 
50 cents a kilowatt-hour. Williams, S., and Bateman, B., "Despite Improved
