engine behind the CONCAWE reputation as a ‘tell it as it is’ organization
is the stream of high quality technical studies which, since inception
in 1963, CONCAWE has been reporting into the public domain. As time has
passed, the questions being addressed have become much more complex, more
to do with economics and more interactive with other issues. Studies were,
therefore, taking longer to complete. Each study group had to establish
its own basis and boundaries whilst working simultaneously but independently
of each other. The reconciliation of results was becoming bedevilled by
apparent anomalies in the basic data and planning assumptions employed.
In the late eighties, CONCAWE’s Refining Planning Advisory Group (RPAG)
was formed to establish a structure for carrying out industry-wide refining
studies and to provide the computing tools to do the job.</P>

<P>At the core of the toolmaking was the CONCAWE Linear Programming (LP)
model; the foundation of the structure was the establishment of a planning
cycle to provide a planning basis and to update it when necessary. The
first CONCAWE planning cycle was carried out in 1994 and was made available
(CONCAWE document no. 95/02) on request to anyone in the business of doing
refinery studies. The structure has proved to be invaluable in carrying
out the many refining studies required for the European Auto/Oil Programme,
and for others such as the disposal options for used lubricating oils.</P>

<P>At the heart of any planning basis is an oil product demand forecast.
CONCAWE has not tried to set itself up in the ‘crystal ball’ forecasting
department but uses the Directorate General for Energy (DG-XVII) view of
the future. This forms a major element in determining the effects of initiatives
which can arise in any of the European legislative bodies. DG-XVII has
recently published its views in ‘European Energy to 2020’. The CONCAWE
RPAG has analysed these views in the context of its own thinking on the
supply side of the equation, such as crude slate developments and future
refinery processing economics trends. The results of this analysis have
been reviewed by a number of independent consultants having an acknowledged
expertise in the field. </P>

<P>Thus, armed with knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses in the supply
and demand scenarios, the RPAG is proceeding with its 1996 Planning Cycle.
The CONCAWE LP model is being used to develop a detailed planning basis
for the year 2000 through to 2010 and beyond. This should be ready well
before the end of this year. </P>
