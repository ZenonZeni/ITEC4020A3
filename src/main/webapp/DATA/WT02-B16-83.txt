<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

 The natural tendency after any disaster     
 is to try to return your life and your      
 home to the way it was before as soon as    
 possible.                                   
<p> 
 Due largely to recent advances in           
 building technologies, it is possible to    
 rebuild your home with a little extra care
 and not much more time or cost and          
 have a home that is much more energy        
 efficient than it was before disaster       
 struck.                                     
<p> 
 If you are faced with the task of           
 repairing or rebuilding a flooded home,     
 you have several opportunities to make
 that home more energy-efficient. By         
 doing so, you will increase your family's   
 comfort, reduce energy consumption          
 and utility bills, increase your property's 
 value, and save money and energy for        
 years to come.                              
<p> 
 In normal times, any decision to upgrade    
 or improve the energy performance of
 your home would have to be based            
 entirely on the energy economics            
 involved.                                   
<p> 
 The silver lining behind the cloud of       
 rebuilding is that most equipment or        
 material must be replaced after a flood
 anyway so it frequently makes sense to      
 buy the most efficient equipment and        
 materials available.                        
<p> 
 Repairs to your flood-damaged home          
 can add energy efficiency at the same       
 time you address pressing structural        
 needs, mainly by replacing and              
 
   upgrading insulation in walls and floors,
    and checking your foundation for flood
    damage. Many energy efficiency options
    are available to you today that may not
    have been widely available when you
    built your house even if that was only a
    few years ago.
<p>
    Cost effectiveness depends on several
    factors, including cost of fuel and
    materials, efficiency levels of the
    structure and components, and climate.
    This booklet offers some general tips to
    improve the efficiency of your home's
    shell and equipment.
<p>
    Additional information on any issue
    covered in this booklet is available from
    various agencies within or near your
    community, including your state energy
    office, local community action agency,
    utilities, Red Cross and Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
    offices.
<p>
    While this booklet focuses on the energy
    efficiency aspects of rebuilding a flood-
    damaged home, there are many other
    issues involved in rebuilding. Further
    information on these topics is also
    available from several sources.
<p>
    Probably the best single source for
    written help is a free 60-page booklet
    titled <b>Repairing Your Flooded Home</b>,
    which is a joint publication of the Red
    Cross and FEMA. For a free copy, write
    to FEMA Publications, P.O. Box 70274,
    Washington, DC 20024, or contact a local
    Red Cross chapter and ask for ARC 4477.

<H2>Part I:<br>
 Dos and Don'ts About Personal Safety and
 Entering the Home After a Flood</h2>
 
 Returning to your home after a flood to survey the damage can be overwhelming.
 Usually, the first urge is to set upon the task of getting things back to the way they were
 as quickly as possible. Before any of that can happen, however, you must first verify
 that the threat of other dangers no longer exists.
 
<p>
 This section is offered to provide useful information to help you take care of the most
 important things first: protect your personal safety, the safety of your family, and the
 safety of your community.
<p>
 
<i><b> Make personal safety your first priority when returning to your home.</i></b>
 
 <h3>DOs:</h3>
 
<ul> 
 <li>   Walk around the premises and look for structural damage. Note any downed,
     fallen, or damaged power lines or broken water lines and smell for gas leaks. If
     power lines or water lines have been damaged, or if you smell gas, notify your
     utility company immediately.
 
 <li>   Wear protective gloves, boots, headgear, goggles, and a respirator (check with
     your local health department for recommendations on the best type). Flood water
     contains raw sewage and other contaminants.
 
 <li>   Wash hands thoroughly after contact with flood water or flood-contaminated
     surfaces.
 
 <li>   If you are directly exposed to flood water, get a tetanus booster shot if you haven't
     had one within five years, or if you're not sure when you last had one.
 
 <li>   See your doctor immediately if you experience abdominal cramping with nausea,
     vomiting, or diarrhea.
 
 <li>   Contact your county health department about testing your water to be sure it's
     safe to drink. Have the wells pumped and the water tested before drinking.
 
 <li>   Use battery-powered lanterns or flashlights to examine buildings. Never use
     matches, lighters, or anything else with an open flame as this could cause an
     explosion if propane, natural gas or other flammable fumes or gases are present.
 
<li>   Keep a battery-powered radio or television handy and tune in frequently for
     information on where to get medical care, housing, clothing, and food, and on
     how to help yourself and your community recover.
 
 <li>   Report fallen utility lines or submerged utility equipment to the police, fire
     department, or your utility company. Keep others away until the authorities
     arrive.
 
</ul>
<h3> DON'Ts:</h3>
 
<ul> 
 <li>   Don't eat food that has come in contact with flood water.
 
 <li>   Don't use oil or gas lanterns or torches, matches, lighters, or anything else with an
     open flame that could cause dangerous flammables present in the home to
     explode.
 
 <li>   Don't handle live electrical equipment in wet areas. Always have a professional
     check and dry electrical equipment before returning it to service. If you're
     uncertain whether equipment is live, assume it is.
 
 <li>   Don't visit the disaster area unnecessarily. Your presence may hamper rescue and
     other emergency operations.
 
 <li>   Don't restart any electrical equipment before having it assessed by a qualified
     contractor. Submersion of electric or gas heating and cooling equipment can cause
     system damage. Restarting without proper inspection could result in electrical
     shock, fire hazard, carbon monoxide poisoning, or explosion.
 
 <li>   Don't go near a submerged or overflowing septic tank, or try to service it yourself
     in any way. If you have a pumped system, disconnect the power to the system
     before checking it, and don't restart the system without having it professionally
     checked and serviced.
</ul> 
<p> 
<b>Entering the Home</b>
 
 <h3>DOs:</h3>
<ul>
 
 <li>   Turn off the power in your home as soon as it is safe to enter, even if the utility
     has turned power off in your neighborhood.
 
 <li>   Turn all electricity off at the main breaker box or fuse box.
 
 <li>   Use a dry wooden stick to switch off the main breaker, if necessary, instead of
     stepping in water to reach the electrical box.
 
 <li>   Shut off the gas by turning the handle of the gas valve perpendicular to the pipe.
     If the valve handle is parallel to the pipe, the gas is on.
 
 <li>   Leave the premises immediately if you smell gas.
 
 <li>   Check for broken or leaking water pipes. If you find any, turn off the water
     supply at the main. If your pipes don't appear to be leaking or broken, you can
     use tap water for hosing and some cleaning, but not for drinking, cooking, or
     washing dishes or clothes until you're sure it's safe.
 
 <li>   Find and protect valuable items, such as money, important papers, jewelry,
     photographs, and family heirlooms. Wash the mud off these items before they dry, if possible. 
     Move them to another location to safe-keeping.
 
 <li>   Step carefully as water and mud can make floors very slippery. Also watch out
     for loose flooring and ceilings that are sagging, as well as for snakes and animals.
 
</ul>
 <h3>DON'Ts:</h3>
<ul> 
 <li>   Don't step in water when turning off the electricity in your home. Instead, use a
     dry wooden stick to switch off the main breaker, if necessary.
 
 <li>   Don't ignore the importance of turning off power in your home, regardless of
     whether the utility company has turned it off in your neighborhood. The utility
     company may restore power without warning.
 
 <li>   Don't try to pick up or clean everything until the more important things are taken
     care of.
</ul>

<h2>Part 2: Drying Out Your Home</h2>
 
 Now you're ready to begin drying out your home and establishing your plan for
 rebuilding. The information contained in this section will help you to dry out and
 decontaminate your home, sort through the debris, and get ready to rebuild your home
 with energy efficiency in mind.
<p> 
 <b>Drying and Disinfecting                     
 Your Home</b>
<p> 
 Flooding in your home has several
 consequences. Materials submerged in        
 flood water can decay, swell, and warp.     
 Electrical equipment and components         
 can become damaged and may cause            
 fires or electrical shock if not replaced   
 after a flood. Wet surfaces encourage       
 mold growth, which discolors surfaces,      
 leads to odor problems, deteriorates        
 building materials, and may cause           
 allergic reactions and other health         
 problems in susceptible individuals.        
 Mud leaves things dirty and the             
 contaminants that may be contained in       
 this mud can pose potential health
 threats.                                    
<p> 
 Controlling and preventing decay is         
 easier to accomplish and reduces the        
 health risks to occupants if done           
 correctly. Control and prevention of the    
 effects of mold and other contaminants is   
 more difficult to accomplish. However,      
 the stakes are much higher. You can         
 minimize these risks by reducing            
 moisture levels in your house through
 drying, <b>and</b> by decontaminating building     
 surfaces.
<p> 
<p> 
<p> 
 
 
   <b>After a flood, you must both dry and
    decontaminate your home. Either
    measure alone is not enough.</b><p>
<p>
    Because flood water and mud contain
    sewage, hazardous and toxic materials
    released upriver, micro-organisms, and
    other contaminants, it is essential to both
    dry and decontaminate your home.
    Drying without decontamination, or
    decontamination without drying, are
    ineffective. Remember too, that all
    materials and tools you use in the
    process, such as clothing, wet/dry
    vacuums, etc., will become contaminated
    and in need of disinfecting when you are
    finished.
<p>
    <b>CAUTION: Contact with flood water
    may result in severe health risks.
    Contaminants in flood water can induce
    cancer, induce birth defects, reduce
    immune system performance, poison
    tissues, cause "sick building syndrome,"
    tuberculosis, Legionnaire's disease,
    aspergillosis, hypersensitivity
    pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, and viral
    respiratory infection.</b>
<p>
    <b>Measures to Help Dry the House</b>
<p>
    Ventilate the building as soon as possible.
    Open doors and windows, as well as
    cabinets, drawers, and closets. Circulate
as much air as possible through the         
 building and its cavities, such as walls    
 and attics.                                 
<p> 
 Heat the building as soon as possible.      
 Moisture will move from inside the home     
 if the indoor temperature is warmer than    
 the outside temperature.
<p> 
 Ventilating and heating are more effective  
 when done together than either is alone.    
<p> 
 If your electricity has been safely         
 restored, use portable fans, window air     
 conditioners (set on fan exhaust only),     
 and dehumidifiers to help speed drying.     
 Remember that it is more effective to       
 remove air from the building than to        
 bring air in. Therefore, if you are using a 
 fan to speed drying, aim it toward the      
 outside to move moist air out.
<p> 
 Use a wet-vacuum to remove as much          
 water as possible from the floors and       
 carpets.                                    
<p> 
 <b>CAUTION: Don't use a regular vacuum         
 cleaner on wet carpet. Regular vacuum       
 cleaners are not designed to remove         
 water and mud and attempting this may       
 result in electric shock.</b>
<p> 
 The central fans and blowers of forced-air  
 heating and air-conditioning systems can
 be disconnected from contaminated           
 ductwork and can be operated for            
 exhausting moist air. Temporary ducts       
 can be connected in such a way that the     
 central blower removes air from the         
 building and discharges it through a        
 temporary duct installed through a          
 window or other opening. This               
 procedure should only be attempted by       
   individuals confident in their ability to
    rewire electrical systems. If you're
    unsure how to do this, contact a
    professional. Also remember that if the
    fan or blower motor has been submerged,
    it will need attention by a professional
    before it can be safely operated.
<p>
    Also, while forced-air heating and air-
    conditioning systems can be used to help
    dry your home, because duct work will
    likely have become wet and
    contaminated from mud and debris, you
    will need to clean the ducts before using
    them. Sheet metal ducts must be hosed
    out and decontaminated. If liners or
    insulation are present in sheet metal
    ducts, remove and discard them. Also
    remove and discard fiberglass ducts, as
    they cannot be properly decontaminated.
<p>
    <b>CAUTION: Powerful exhaust fans can
    cause harmful flue gases to be drawn
    down chimneys and into the living
    space if the house is closed up tight. If
    you are using a powerful exhaust fan
    when heating systems with chimneys
    are also present, proper venting, such as
    opening doors and windows, is
    essential.
<p>
    How can you tell when your home is
    dry?</b>
<p>
    Depending on things such as the extent
    of flooding and the weather, drying your
    home after a flood could take anywhere
    from several days to several months, or
    even longer. To determine whether your
    house is adequately dried, you should
    consult with a professional, such as a
    local contractor, your county extension
    agent, or the local building inspector,
who may have a moisture meter to test       
 your home's moisture level.                 
<p> 
 Since acceptable moisture levels vary in
 different parts of the country, also consult
 with these professionals about the          
 recommended levels for your area.           
<p> 
 If you're unable to locate anyone in your   
 community who offers moisture level         
 testing, see the list of moisture meter     
 manufacturers in <a href="#ref10">Appendix 1.</a>                
<p> 
 <b>How can you prevent recurrent moisture      
 problems in the future?                     </b>
<p> 
 Moisture may persist as a problem in        
 your home even after you feel that you      
 have dried out everything that can be       
 dried. Excessive moisture that remains in   
 your home can lead to mold, mildew and
 rot, causing damage that goes beyond the    
 initial mess caused by the flood if it is   
 left unattended.
<p> 
 For human health and comfort, relative      
 humidity in a home should be kept           
 between 30 and 50 percent. During           
 winter months, when outdoor                 
 temperatures are colder, relative           
 humidity should be kept as close to 40      
 percent as possible. You can buy simple     
 inexpensive instruments to measure          
 indoor relative humidity at a local         
 hardware store.                             
<p> 
 If you find that the relative humidity of
 your home is higher than 50 to 60
   percent, you should take steps to reduce
    it, as this might be the source of
    problems.
<p>
    Take care not to aggravate any moisture
    problems in your home as well. Seek out
    and reduce the causes of dampness: a lot
    of cooking with uncovered pots;
    unrepaired leaks; hanging clothes
    indoors to dry; long, hot showers without
    adequate venting. These few examples
    might not apply exactly in your case, but
    they may point you toward potential
    sources in your home.
<p>
    One suggestion is to open your windows
    and doors once or twice a day during
    milder weather to provide a complete
    change of air. Good circulation of indoor
    air prevents trapped pockets of moist air
    from causing problems.
<p>
  <b>  Measures to Help Decontaminate
    the House</b>
<p>
    Your home should be cleaned from mud
    and silt immediately to remove any
    sewage and micro-organisms that may
    have been deposited on building surfaces
    by flood water. However, removing mud
    and debris is only the first step. Surfaces
    that have been cleaned will still be wet
    and will require time to dry. As these
    surfaces dry, they will become hosts for
    mold and other biological growth.
    Therefore, your home may have to be
    decontaminated again once it is dry.
<p>
<b>Cleaning or decontamination alone is        
 not sufficient. You will need to do both.   </b>
<p> 
 To decontaminate surfaces, apply a          
 solution of diluted chlorine bleach on      
 surfaces that have come in contact with     
 flood water or mud.                         
 
 Experts suggest a solution of 5 to 10       
 percent bleach. If you can respond right
 away, the 5 percent solution will be        
 enough. The higher concentration is         
 recommended for surfaces that have          
 heavier contamination. In all cases,
 repeat the treatment at least twice within  
 a 30-minute period.                         
<p> 
 Be sure the area is well-ventilated, and    
 wear a mask and gloves to protect
 yourself when doing any cleaning or         
 decontamination work.                       
<p> 
 New decontamination techniques done
 by trained professionals are also an
 option to consider. For more
 information, check your Yellow Pages
 under "Restoration,"
 "Fire Restoration," or "Carpet Cleaning,"
   or see <a href="#ref11">Appendix 2</a>. Some products and
    materials, such as some carpets, ceiling
    tiles, upholstered furniture, and
    mattresses, will be virtually impossible to
    dry and effectively decontaminate after a
    flood. Such products should be removed
    and discarded.
<p>
    <b>Removing Debris</b>
<p>
    Before installing new materials in your
    house, remove and dispose of the wet,
    broken, and unusable materials.
<p>
    Since flood damage is usually
    widespread throughout affected areas,
    there will be a significant impact on local
    landfills.
<p>
    Check with your local health department
    and sanitarian for recommendations on
    how best to dispose of debris.

<b>Federal Occupational Health Protocol for Controlling Microbial Growth
 After a Flood</b>
<p>
 
 1.   Inventory all flooded areas so that every water damaged area is treated and cleaned.
 
<p>
 
 2.   Remove and dispose of wet ceiling tiles and drywall within 24 hours of water contact.
 
<p>
 3.   Remove and replace all drywall and insulation damaged by water up to 12 inches above the
      water line. Wicking can cause water to move up several inches above the water level.
 
<p>
 4.   Dry all wet light fixtures.
 
<p>
 5.   Water damaged furniture should be replaced or cleaned with a diluted 10 bleach solution.
      Furniture made of particle board or pressed wafer board should be discarded. Wood furniture
      can be salvaged by removing microbial growth with a bleach solution. However, check to see
      whether the solution will damage the furniture finish. Fabrics soaked in standing water should
      be treated the same as carpets (see below).
 
<p>
 6.   Leave all cabinets and drawers open to facilitate air flow for drying. All surfaces of cabinets 
      and drawers should be wiped and disinfected with a diluted bleach solution.
 
<p>
 7.   Remove any essential wet paper from the flooded area to a location where it can be dried,
      photocopied, and then discarded.
 
<p>
 8.   If a large amount of tiles and paperwork cannot be dried within two days, essential tiles and
      paperwork may be rinsed with clean water and temporarily frozen until proper drying of the
      tiles and paperwork can be completed. Never let paper products become moldy.
 
<p>
 9.   Immediately remove as much water as possible from wet carpeting using wet vacuums.
 
<p>
 10.  Upon completion of the wet vacuuming, shampoo the carpet with a 10-percent bleach solution
      twice within a 30-minute period. Begin shampooing as soon as the wet vacuuming is finished.
      Before beginning the bleach treatment, conduct a spot test in an inconspicuous area to see if 
      the bleach fades the carpet
 
<p>
 11.  If the carpet fades with the bleach solution, then the area must be immediately dried and    
      treated with an alternate biocide. <i>Consult a microbiologist to determine what type of biocide 
      to use, since certain biocides are inhibitors and may not effectively kill microbes.</i>
 
 
<p>
 12.  Rinse the carpet with clear water to remove the bleach solution. Take steps to ensure that the
      carpet is <i>totally dry within 12-24 hours of treatment.</i>
 
<p>
 13.  Increase air circulation and ventilation if any biocide is used.
 
<p>
 14.  Air and material testing for microorganisms should be performed immediately after the flood
      and periodically thereafter by a trained environmental health professional to ensure that no
      microbial amplification and excessive human exposure occur. Post-cleanup clearance sampling
       and inspection are necessary to ensure that no excessive concentrations of microbes still exist 
      in the building.
 
<p>
 15.  Use dehumidifiers and air conditioning/ventilation to speed up the drying process.

<h2>Part 3: Planning For Rebuilding -<br>
 Adding Energy Efficiency</h2>
 
 This section is offered to provide what you need to know about your house and its
 damage before you start to rebuild. It also provides details about the many steps you
 can take at this stage to add energy efficiency into your home to make it more
 comfortable, affordable, and energy efficient in the years to come.
<p>
 
<a name="ref5">
 <h3>Building Shell Issues</h3>                       
<p> 
 Rebuilding a flooded house can be very      
 expensive, so it is important to            
 understand which items you must             
 replace, which items you can salvage,       
 and what you can do yourself.
<p> 
 First, you need to estimate your building
 construction and technical skills. This     
 will tell you how much work you can do      
 yourself without hiring contractors.        
<p> 
 Second, you need to collect information     
 on the extent of damage, how you would
 like to rebuild, and your financial         
 resources. Rebuilding is an opportunity     
 for homeowners not only to rebuild, but     
 to upgrade their houses in the process.     
<p> 
 To accomplish this inexpensively you        
 need to know:                               
<p> 
<ul>
 <li>    the degree of flood damage,            
 <li>    the level of improvement you
 <li>    would like to reach during the         
      rebuilding process,                    
 <li>    what you can do by yourself,           
 <li>    what can be done only by               
      professionals, and                     
 <li>    which materials, if any, can be        
      reused.                                
</ul>
<p> 
   By carefully inspecting every part of your
    home and surrounding area, and by
    answering these questions, it should be
    possible for you to develop a work-
    program aimed at inexpensive
    rebuilding.
<p> 
   <b> Air Leaks</b>
<p> 
    Increasing a home's airtightness will
    lower its space heating and cooling
    requirements, allowing you to install a
    smaller, less expensive heating or cooling
    system.
<p> 
    Airtightness is essentially accomplished
    by minimizing leaks using caulking and
    weatherstripping. While you are
    repairing, pinpoint where air is leaking
    into the home and then seal those leaks.
    Common air leakage points include
    openings for plumbing and wiring,
    recessed lights, attic hatches, and at the
    top of foundation walls (See <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).
<p> 
    Caulking can effectively seal smaller gaps
    (less than about 1/4"), but be sure to
    select a caulk that is suitable for the
    materials you are sealing. For larger gaps
    (1/4" to 1"), use an expanding foam, or a
    backer rod followed by caulk. If your
    windows and doors have been broken or
    damaged due to flooding, now is an
opportune time to upgrade their             
 efficiencies.                               
<p> 
 A simple and quick way to cut down the      
 heat loss from your existing windows is to  
 seal around them with caulk. Doors
 should also be weatherstripped to make a    
 tight seal when they are closed.            
<hr>
<a name="fig1">
<img src="/overview/disaster/flood1.gif">

<hr>
<p> 
 <b>Windows</b>
<p> 
 Windows can account for as much as 25       
 percent of the heat loss in homes. If
 existing units are in good condition, you   
 can cost-effectively improve their
 performance with weatherstripping and       
 caulk, as mentioned earlier. To double      
 the energy efficiency of single-pane        
 windows, install storm windows.             
<p> 
 If your existing windows have been          
 damaged or are in poor condition,           
 consider replacing them with new,           
 higher efficiency units. Double-pane
 windows incorporating the new               
 technologies of low-emissivity coatings     
 and gas-filling for greater insulation      
 value are now the standard with many        
 major window manufacturers. These           
 units could cost about 25 percent more
 than a standard, double-glazed unit, but    
 they are about twice as efficient, making   
 the cost premium worthwhile.                
<p> 
 Select wood, vinyl, or fiberglass frames    
 rather than metal ones. Metals such as      
 steel or aluminum are poor insulators       
 and can account for as much as 24
 percent of a window's overall heat loss,
 in addition to contributing to
 condensation problems.
<p> 
   There are, however, metal windows
    which include a "thermal break" to avoid
    high heat loss. Be sure to ask for this
    feature if you decide to select metal
    windows.
<p> 
    And finally, windows that close against
    compression seals, such as casement and
    awning windows, tend to be more
    airtight than windows with sliding seals,
    such as double-hung and horizontal
    sliders.
<p> 
    <b>Doors</b>
<p> 
    Inspect exterior doors to be sure they are
    in good condition. Solid wooden doors
     that swell will tend to return to their
    original size when dry. Give them time
    to dry thoroughly before making
    adjustments. Check for warping or other
    structural damage if the doors have been
    exposed to flood water.
<p> 
    Quality construction, proper fit, adequate
     weatherstripping, airtight jambs, and
    tight-fitting hardware are important to a
    door's efficiency. Obviously, any broken
    glass in the door should be replaced.
     Sweeps installed on the bottoms of doors
    can also help to ensure a tight seal. If
    your door is not very airtight, consider
    installing a storm door to reduce heat
    loss, or replacing the door with a new,
    insulated model with good
    weatherstripping.
<p> 
Many wood doors are made from               
 hardboard or contain hardboard spacers.     
 However, wood products such as              
 hardboard, plywood and oriented-strand      
 boards will not regain their original       
 shape when dried after substantial          
 wetting.                                    
<p> 
 Plywood and oriented-strand boards
 may delaminate. Hardboard swells            
 when wet and can lose its strength.         
 These products will have to be discarded    
 and replaced.
<p> 
 <b>Insulation</b>
<p> 
 If flood water has reached the insulation   
 of your walls, floors, or ceiling, you will 
 need to replace it (See <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Some
 sources say that fiberglass insulation can  
 be dried and reused with no loss of         
 thermal performance. However, once          
 any type of insulation has been exposed     
 to flood water, the possibility for mold or 
 mildew growth and the resultant             
 potential indoor air quality problem        
 exists. Therefore, flood-contaminated       
 insulation should be replaced. Insulation   
 is not the most expensive of materials      
 and salvaging it is probably not worth      
 the effort given the potential for          
 problems.                                   
 <p>
 Replacing your insulation provides an       
 opportunity to select a product with a
 higher insulating or R-value, which will    
 slow down the heat lost or gained within    
 the house. For example, many homes          
 with standard two-by-four framing have      
 fibrous batts rated R-11. Within the same   
 limited space, you can boost the            
 insulating value to R-13 or R-15 by
 
 
   installing medium- or high-density
    fiberglass batts. Another option to
    increase your wall's R-value is to add
    insulating foam sheathing to the outside
    walls. While availability and cost of
    these materials may vary in different
    areas, they can be cost-effective especially
    where energy costs are high.
<p> 
    Added insulation may allow you to
    downsize your heating or cooling
    systems, saving energy and money.
<p> 
    You should also insulate attics and floors
    above unconditioned spaces to at least
    the minimum recommended levels. To
    determine what these levels are for your
    area, see <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>.
<p> 
    As you replace your insulation, you will
    discover that drywall and wood framing
    may also be wet. While you'll want to
    replace your insulation and drywall as
    soon as you can, be aware that it can take
    weeks or months for a house to
    completely dry out. The house must be
    completely dry before it is re-insulated to
    avoid later damage to building materials
    and serious health problems for your
    family that may develop if moisture,
    mold, and mildew are allowed to go
    untreated in your house.

    <b>Foundations</b>
<p> 
    Wet or flooded foundations will be a
    continuous source of moisture, and can
    increase the time needed to dry the rest of
    the house. Homes with basements
    require special attention during the
    aftermath of a flood.
<p> 
Do not be in too big a hurry to pump        
 water out of your basement. Water in the    
 ground outside your house is pushing        
 hard against the outside of your            
 basement walls. At the same time, the       
 water inside your basement is pushing       
 back. It is important to keep these two     
 forces balanced as the water subsides. If   
 the forces become unbalanced by             
 pumping too rapidly, the basement floors    
 or walls may crack.
<p> 
 It's important to keep basement floor       
 drains open and clear as flood water        
 recedes to allow the pressures from         
 outside and inside the foundation walls     
 to equalize.                                
<p> 
 Crawl spaces require special attention as   
 well. First, remove and discard all wet     
 insulation and plastic sheeting you find    
 there. Next, dry out the crawl space        
 using natural or powered ventilation
 such as a fan if necessary.                 
<p> 
 This may be a good time to check with       
 local building officials to determine if    
 your crawl space is adequately vented.      
 Finally, crawl spaces should have           
 continuous plastic ground covers            
 installed once standing water has been      
 drained or pumped out of the crawl
 space. Damp ground that is not covered      
 will continue to be a major moisture        
 source. Crawl spaces should be              
 ventilated as much as possible to dry       
 them out.                                   
<p> 
 <b>Floors and Flooring</b>
<p> 
 Unfortunately, most floor coverings will    
 not survive a flood and should probably     
   be replaced. If you can remove them
    yourself, you can save a lot of time and
    money. By removing them you will also
    be helping the house to dry. And doing
    so doesn't require any special equipment
    or experience. If the floodwater reached
    wall-to-wall carpeting, you should
    discard it. To make this job easier, cut
    carpet and padding into strips that are
    small enough to carry.
<p> 
    Tile, vinyl, and linoleum should also be
    removed to speed the drying of the floor.
    Although a good floor finish helps by
    preventing the water from penetrating
    the surface from above, the underside of
    the floor allows water to penetrate from
    below and cause swelling and damage.
    When the floor is dry, you can sometimes
    correct "cupping" by sanding and
    refinishing. Otherwise, you must replace
    the flooring.
<p> 
    Tile, vinyl, and linoleum are usually
    installed over an underlayment, which in
    turn is installed on a structural subfloor.
    Water can loosen these materials directly
    or through swelling of the underlayment
    so it may be necessary to replace the
    flooring material and probably even the
    underlayment.
<p> 
    Structural subflooring is usually plywood
    or oriented-strand board. Older types of
    plywood made for interiors are especially
    susceptible to damage since they may not
    have waterproof glue between the
    veneers. Water penetrates the unfinished
    edges and surfaces of the plywood
    causing the veneers to soften, swell and
    delaminate. If this has occurred, you
    may need to replace the structural
subfloor as well. If in doubt, check with   
 your local building department or a         
 contractor.                                 
<p> 
 Before you begin to rebuild or refinish,    
 it's important that the wood structure of   
 the home be completely dry. Refer to the    
 earlier section on drying and
 decontaminating your home.                  
<p> 
 <b>Walls</b>
<p> 
 <b>Interior Finish</b>                             
<p> 
 In most homes, ceilings and walls are       
 covered by either plaster or drywall.       
 Plaster can regain its strength when
 dried, however it can not be                
 decontaminated. Therefore, wet plaster      
 should be removed and discarded.            
<p> 
 Drywall acts like a sponge drawing water    
 up above the flood level. Drywall           
 becomes very fragile if it stays wet for a  
 long time, and it will fall apart when
 bumped. Drywall can't be                    
 decontaminated either and should also
 be discarded. Because new drywall will      
 be installed horizontally, a good line to   
 remove old drywall to will be about 48"     
 above the floor.                            
<p> 
 Check to make sure that the insulation      
 above this line is dry and hasn't wicked    
 water any higher. Insulation can act like   
 a paper towel does with a counter spill,    
 pulling up water much higher than the       
 point of contact with flood water. If it is 
 wet, remove all drywall.                    
<p> 
<p> 
All wall coverings inhibit drying so they
 should be removed and discarded, even
 in homes where the flood water has not
 actually reached the walls. New wall
 coverings can be installed once the
 building has been dried and
 decontaminated.
<p> 
 Wood construction is durable and will
 normally be structurally sound even after
 being in water. But once the water
 recedes, the moist contaminated
 environment allows decay organisms to
 flourish. If the environment persists, the
 decay will cause structural damage.
 Therefore, you must dry the structure.
<p> 
 Kiln-dried or well-seasoned wood used
 for residential framing can absorb water
 and will swell as a result. However, as
 the wood dries it will often return to its
 original shape and strength. Remember
 that even if this occurs, you will need to
 decontaminate.
<p> 
<b> Exterior Finish</b>
<p> 
 Most homes will have either siding or
 brick on the exterior. To facilitate drying,
 walls can also be opened from the
 exterior. In the case of wood-lapped
 siding, plastic wedges can be inserted
 under the siding at the horizontal lap
 joint. Use a pry bar carefully. Place a
 wedge beside each nail. The wedges will
 stay in place permanently and will
 improve paint performance. These
 wedges under siding are only an
 additional measure, not an alternative
 measure - you must still open and
 completely expose all exterior walls from
 the inside of the home.
<p> 
In the case of brick, generally good        
 quality brick masonry can withstand         
 flooding over long periods. Most types      
 of brick will dry out and show no           
 permanent damage from water.
 However, if the mortar is old or of poor    
 quality, damage can occur from strong       
 water currents or wave action. In           
 addition, a disturbance or subsidence of    
 the foundation can cause cracks in brick    
 masonry. Do a careful inspection or get     
 professional help. Even tiny cracks may     
 be evidence of much larger and costly       
 problems with the foundation.
<p> 
 <b>Electrical</b>
<p> 
 Electrical wiring in walls may suffer       
 damage from wetting. The damage will        
 depend on how well-sealed and               
 impervious its shielding is. In many        
 homes, plastic coated wiring is used, and   
 it is fairly waterproof. Plastic-coated     
 wiring will probably not need to be         
 replaced after a flood.                     
<p> 
 
 Any outlet or switch, and all connections   
 that have been under water for any          
 period, however, may corrode. It is         
 cheaper and safer to replace outlets and    
 switches and to redo connections than to    
 repair them. All electrical work should     
 only be done by a qualified electrician.    
<p> 
 
 During the rebuild, you may want to         
 consider adding or moving outlets,          
 switches and fixtures. Ground fault         
 interrupters installed in each branch of an 
 electrical circuit are a good idea to       
 consider as well. If the house is old, it is
 possible the existing electrical service
  maybe undersized. Consult your
  contractor about the feasibility of adding
  a larger service entry and more breakers.
<p> 
  Since you'll be doing electrical work
  anyway to recover from the flood and the
  walls will be open for easy access, it may
  be a timely opportunity to consider
  electrical system improvements. Also,
  cabling for television, audio, and even
  security systems will be easy to install at
  this time.
<p> 
  <b>Ceilings</b>
<p> 
  A ceiling may not have been touched by
  flood water, but it can still be damaged
  by humidity. Check to see if drywall has
  swelled or pulled away from the framing.
  If it has, replacement will probably be
  necessary. If sections of the ceiling are
  sagging, carefully punch a few small
  holes at the low spots to drain collected
  water.
<p> 
  If flood water reached a drywall ceiling,
  you should remove and replace it. If the
  ceiling is plaster, it will dry eventually
  but will likely sag or crack, so it should
  also be removed and replaced. Remove
  all ceiling insulation to allow the joists to
  dry.
<p> 
  Consider upgrading the ceiling insulation
  as you rebuild. Remember, once the
  insulation contractor is on site to
  reinsulate walls, the extra cost of
  additional ceiling or attic insulation could
  be relatively minor.

<h2>Building Systems and                        
 Equipment Issues</h2>                            
<p> 
 <b>Flooding Effects on Equipment               
 and Appliances</b>
<p> 
<p> 
 Residential heating and cooling systems,    
 refrigerators, water heaters and other      
 appliances in contact with flood water      
 can pose an extreme risk to the             
 homeowner.                                  
<p> 
 <b>CAUTION: Gas and electricity are            
 dangerous and if not properly handled
 and controlled, can result in explosion,    
 electrical shock, and even death.           </b>
<p> 
<p> 
 Therefore, from a safety standpoint, it is  
 essential to restore heating and cooling    
 systems and appliances to safe operating    
 condition through repair or replacement
 <b>before</b> restoring power.                     
<p> 
 In addition to safety, there are health     
 concerns associated with equipment and      
 appliances affected by floods. Always       
 assume that flood water brings              
 contaminants. If equipment in the home      
 has been in contact with flood water, the   
 equipment could be contaminated by          
 harmful bacteria and organics from the      
 flood water.                                
 
<p> 
 It is essential to eliminate these          
 substances from appliances, particularly    
 those used for food storage and             
 preparation, and any equipment in           
 contact with potable water. While           
 thorough cleaning of all surfaces with a    
 disinfectant is necessary, you need to do   
 more to return equipment to safe
 operation. The general procedure
  involved is cleaning, disinfecting, drying,
  and having a qualified professional
  inspect equipment.
<p>
  Repairing your home and replacing its
  various systems represents a big
  opportunity for you to save significant
  amounts of energy and money in the long
  term. If your heating system, water
  heater, air conditioner and other major
  appliances have been damaged, you can
  upgrade to more energy-efficient models.    
<p>
  
  Some energy-efficient appliances cost no
  more than their inefficient counterparts.
  And while an energy-efficient furnace or
  air conditioner may cost you more
  initially, it will be cheaper to operate and
  will pay for itself in energy savings in just
  a few years.
<p>
  For example,if your gas furnace is only
  about 60-percent efficient, as many older
  models are, upgrading to a 90-percent
  efficient model can lower your annual
  heating bill by about one-third. A new
  energy efficient refrigerator will consume
  about half the electricity of a model built
  15 years ago. Depending on your local
  electric rates, a new model could save
  you up to $100 per year.
<p>
  
  Additionally, your utility may offer
  rebates for the purchase of high-efficiency
  furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners
  or refrigerators. Utilities, along with
  government and private agencies in your
  area, are ready to help you make
  informed energy-saving decisions as you
  rehabilitate your flood-damaged home.
<p>
The Federal Government sets energy          
 consumption limits on furnaces, clothes     
 washers, water heaters, dishwashers,        
 refrigerators and freezers, room air
 conditioners, central air conditioners and  
 heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp            
 ballasts. As a result, today appliances are 
 more energy-efficient than their            
 predecessors. However, many appliances      
 are more efficient than the minimum         
 standards. Use the EnergyGuide labels to    
 compare efficiencies of appliances. These   
 labels display the appliance's annual
 energy cost, based on estimated annual      
 hours of use and on a national average      
 energy price.                               
<p> 
 Because energy prices vary from region      
 to region, the labels also include a cost
 table that allows consumers to estimate     
 operating costs based on local rates.       
<p> 
 An excellent reference to help you choose   
 energy efficient heating, cooling, and      
 water-heating equipment is the              
 <b>Consumer Guide to Home Energy               
 Savings</b>, which lists the most energy        
 efficient models available in all of these  
 categories and more. See other sources of   
 information in <a href="#ref11">Appendix 2</a>.

 <b>Special Considerations For                  
 Electric Motors</b>                             
<p> 
 There are a considerable number of          
 electric motors in your home. The           
 furnace, whether gas or electric, washer,   
 dryer, air-conditioner, dishwasher,         
 refrigerator, and freezer all have an
 electric motor which may be damaged by
  exposure to flood water. As always,
  safety should be your first consideration.
<p> 
  <b>CAUTION: Don't start up any heating,
  cooling, or other electrical equipment
  that has come in contact with flood
  water. Serious damage and life-
  threatening injury can occur. Be sure
  that all electrical equipment is either
  unplugged or power to it has been
  disconnected at the main breaker.</b>
<p> 
  Any electrical equipment that has an
  electric motor and has been subjected to
  flood water will need to be inspected and
  evaluated individually by appropriate
  professionals before using.
<p> 
  Contact your insurance adjuster to
  determine your coverage for repair
  versus replacement, especially of heating
  and air conditioning equipment. Also
  check your warranty, if possible. Flood
  damage to this equipment may not be
  covered by warranty. The objective is to
  make an informed decision on whether
  repair or replacement is the best course.
  Successfully repairing an electric motor
  depends on the following considerations:
<ul>
  <li>    the length of time the motor was
       under water,
  <li> the age of the motor,
  <li>    the type of bearings involved and
       how they are lubricated, and
  <li>    the type of contaminants in the
       flood water.
</ul>
Repair costs, particularly for heating and 
 cooling equipment that has been exposed    
 to flood water will likely be extensive.   
 Manufacturers usually recommend that       
 all motors, electrical components, safety  
 controls, and (in the case of gas          
 appliances) gas valves be replaced. A      
 detailed and thorough cleaning and         
 disinfecting of all components is also     
 recommended.                               
<p>
 Given the likely expense of attempting to  
 have equipment repaired, replacement       
 may be the best option. Especially
 considering the potential for selecting    
 new equipment which is much more           
 energy efficient.                          
<p>
<p>
 <b>Space Heating Systems</b><p>                      
 <b>Gas Furnaces and Boilers</b>                   
<p>
 Natural gas furnaces, space heaters and    
 boilers all have gas valves and controls   
 that are especially vulnerable to water    
 damage from floods. Corrosion begins       
 inside the valves and controls, and        
 damage may not be readily visible, even    
 if the outside of the device is clean and  
 dry. At a minimum, this damage can         
 result in reliability problems. More
 severe consequences could be fire or       
 explosion. If there is any question        
 whether flood water has reached a gas      
 appliance, have the unit checked by a      
 professional. In all cases where you have  
 decided to try to salvage the unit, you    
 will need to replace gas valves, pilot and 
 burner orifices, controls, and the filter. 
 This work should only be done by a         
 qualified professional.
<p> 
  There are differing opinions regarding
   replacement versus repair of flood-
   damaged heating systems; however, most
   experts recommend replacement. Even if
   a furnace has been cleaned of debris and
   mud, and disinfected (often at great cost),
   and seems to be working properly, parts
   may later corrode or malfunction and
   you may also lose your warranty
   coverage. The older a heating system is,
   the more likely it is to be inefficient, so
   you may be better off replacing yours
   even if it hasn't sustained much damage.
<p> 
   Replacing a heating system is a complex
   matter, difficult under any circumstances.
   Yet, as a result of flood damage, you may
   have no choice but to replace your
   furnace. You can turn misfortune into
   opportunity by considering a new,
   energy-efficient model that will lower
   your future heating bills. Depending on
   the type of fuel you use - oil, electricity,
   propane, wood or natural gas - this may
   be also a good time to consider switching
   fuels. See the worksheet in <a href="#ref12">Appendix 3</a> to
   help determine which fuel will be
   cheapest for you. Also ask your local
   utility about available rebates for new
   energy-efficient gas or propane furnaces.
<p> 
   If you have a central forced-air furnace in
   the house you are repairing, devote some
   attention to your ductwork too. Do not
   try to salvage duct insulation that has
   been in contact with flood water. It is
   impossible to decontaminate. Next,
   clean, dry and disinfect the ductwork.
   Doing a thorough job will require
   disassembling the ductwork. Since
many ducts are leaky, uninsulated, and      
 lose a tremendous amount of heat, this is   
 also your opportunity to eliminate          
 wasteful heat loss. The best approach is    
 to carefully seal all joints in the ductwork,
 and insulate all ducts located in
 unconditioned spaces such as attics and     
 crawl spaces.
<p> 
 <b>Special Considerations                      
 for Propane Systems</b>                         
<p> 
 Propane-fired heating equipment should      
 be dealt with the same way as indicated     
 for natural gas-fired equipment. In every   
 case, you should replace all valves and     
 controls that have been in contact with     
 flood water. Propane systems also           
 require attention to their gas pressure     
 regulator. This regulator contains a small
 vent hole in its body to sense outside      
 pressure. For effective gas regulation,     
 this hole must always remain                
 unobstructed. During a flood, debris can    
 easily plug the hole, causing dangerous     
 malfunction and corrosion.
<p> 
 <b>CAUTION: You must replace all               
 pressure regulators used in propane         
 systems affected by flood water.            </b>
 
<p> 
 Unlike natural gas, propane is heavier      
 than air. Consequently, propane can         
 settle to the floor or to the basement of a 
 home, and being invisible, would            
 produce a hazardous situation that could    
 easily go unnoticed. Basements and
 other low places are locations where        
 propane would tend to collect. This         
 makes working around areas where            
 propane has leaked quite dangerous.         
 
 
 
  Use extreme caution where there is the
   potential for propane leaks and get
   propane equipment checked, repaired
   and/or replaced by a qualified
  professional as quickly as possible.
<p>
   <b>Electric Heat</b>
<p>
   Electric resistance space heating for
   homes exists in a variety of
   configurations, but the most common
   type is the wall- or baseboard-mounted
   units. Although they can be costly to
   operate depending on the price of
   electricity in your area, these systems
   have flexibility in providing heat to
   individual rooms in a house and can even
   be operated from individual thermostats
   in each room or zone of a house.
<p>
   The baseboard-mount types have no
   moving parts and unless they are
   damaged by an electrical short, they will
   withstand flood conditions.
<p>
   Before returning these systems to
   operation, disconnect electrical power to
   each unit by switching off the main
    breaker. All connections at the heater and
   control thermostat should be allowed to
   dry carefully and thoroughly. Before
   restoring electrical power, a qualified
   electrician should check for shorts on all
   heating circuits. You can then restore
   electrical power and use the heaters to
   help dry out the interior of the house.
<p>
   Sometimes in emergencies, stand-alone,
   plug-in heaters are used by homeowners
   as a source of temporary supplemental
   heat. These heaters, however, usually
contain a small fan, and its motor will     
 likely need special attention after being   
 submerged.                                  
<p> 
 A second type of electric space heat is the 
 central electric furnace. This furnace      
 consists of electrically heated coils, a fan
 to provide air circulation across the coils,
 and controls which include safety relays.   
 Just like the gas forced-air furnace, the   
 electric forced-air system is susceptible to
 corrosion and damage, resulting in
 reliability problems or safety hazards. If  
 there is any question whether flood water   
 has reached an electric furnace, have the
 unit checked by a professional. In all      
 cases where you have decided to try to      
 salvage the unit, a qualified professional  
 will need to replace all controls, safety   
 interlocks, and probably motors.            
<p> 
 Electric forced-air heating systems have    
 essentially the same ductwork as gas-       
 forced air systems, so the same actions     
 are in order. Discard any wet duct          
 insulation. Disassemble, clean, disinfect,  
 and dry the ductwork. Take extra care in
 reassembling the ductwork to avoid          
 leaks. Carefully insulate all ducts in      
 unconditioned spaces.                       
<p> 
 <b>Radiant Ceiling Heat</b>                        
<p> 
 In this type of heating system,             
 electrically-heated cables are embedded     
 in the plaster or drywall ceiling. The      
 cables warm the ceiling, which in turn      
 warms the room by radiant heat.             
<p> 
 
 
 
 
 
  If the ceiling becomes wet from a flood,
   the plasterboard will weaken, and
   perhaps crack and the ceiling will need
   replacement. Although the electrical
   cables themselves may appear to be
   undamaged due to their tough,
   waterproof coating, there may have been
   large mechanical stresses on the cable,
   and a qualified electrician should be
   consulted to determine whether the cable
   is reusable.
<p> 
   <b> Heat Pumps And Air
   Conditioning Systems</b>
<p> 
   Heat pumps extract heat from the outside
   air and transport this heat into the house
   with the aid of a refrigerant. Reversing
   this process allows the same heat pump
   system to provide air conditioning for the
   home, eliminating the need for a separate
   cooling system. Some heat pumps (the
   unitary type) are simple wall-or window-
   mount, and some (split systems) are more
   elaborate, with part of the components
   indoors and part outdoors.
<p> 
   Of the various types of split-system heat
   pumps that are in use, two things they
   have in common are the power and
   control wiring between the indoor and
   outdoor parts of the system, and the
   piping that moves the refrigerant from
   inside to outside the home and back. The
   refrigeration circuit of virtually all
   residential heat pump (and air
   conditioning) systems is sealed at the
   factory. In a split system it is sealed by
   the contractor during installation.
<p> 
Even if the system is in contact with flood 
 water for a long period, this sealed        
 system is likely to remain intact.          
 However, if flood water has repositioned    
 either the indoor or outdoor units of a     
 split system by only a small amount,        
 there is the potential for a breached       
 refrigerant system. The heat pump (or       
 air conditioning system) will then require
 major repair or full replacement.           
<p> 
 If the refrigerant system remains intact    
 after the flood, the entire system should   
 be cleaned, dried, and disinfected. You     
 should have a qualified electrical or       
 refrigeration mechanic check all electrical 
 and refrigeration connections for both      
 indoor and outdoor units, including all     
 control circuits. The decision to repair or 
 replace should be made by a qualified       
 professional on a case-by-case basis.       
<p> 
 As with the other types of heating          
 systems, the heat pump system will also     
 have a system of distribution ducts. The
 same procedures of disassembling,           
 cleaning, disinfecting, and drying are in
 order. Remember to carefully reassemble     
 the ductwork without leaks, and to          
 insulate those portions of the ducts that   
 go through unconditioned spaces.            
<p> 
 If you need to replace your existing heat   
 pump, or if you are considering             
 switching to a heat pump because your       
 existing heating system is beyond repair,   
 consider the most energy-efficient model    
 available. If electricity is the only energy
 source available, and the climate requires
  considerable cooling and heating during
   the year, a heat pump system can be
   more cost-effective than electric
   resistance heating with a separate air-
   conditioning system. Using the
   worksheet in <a href="#ref12">Appendix 3</a>, you can
   analyze the relative costs of various fuels
   and heating systems.
<p> 
   To compare the energy efficiency of
   residential heat pumps, consult the
   Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER)
   for cooling and the Heating Seasonal
   Performance Factor (HSPF) for heating.
   Efficiency ratings for heat pumps are
   listed in the <b>Consumer Guide to Home
   Energy Savings, Third Edition</b>. More
   extensive ratings of heat pumps can be
   found in an annual directory published
   by the Air-Conditioning and
   Refrigeration Institute (ARI). You may be
   able to obtain this directory in a library or
   from a contractor. See <a href="#ref11">Appendix 2</a> for
   sources of both references.
<p> 
   <b>Space Cooling Systems</b>
<p> 
   whether your home has been cooled with
   a central air conditioning system, a heat
   pump, or room air conditioners, you can
   replace flood-damaged units with
   energy-efficient models that can cut
   energy use by more than 20 percent. A
   professional can help you select a unit
   based on the size and tightness of your
   home. Your local utility may offer rebates
   on the purchase of energy-efficient air
   conditioners, too.
<p> 
Consumers can compare the efficiency of     
 central air conditioners and heat pumps     
 (in the cooling cycle) using the SEER.      
 The higher the SEER, the more efficient     
 the unit. Room air conditioners are rated
 by a counterpart system called the          
 Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER).              
<p> 
 The American Council for an Energy          
 Efficient Economy recommends central        
 air conditioners with a SEER of at least    
 12, and room conditioners with an EER of    
 at least 9. No matter what type of system   
 you choose, make sure that it is sized      
 properly by a qualified air-conditioning    
 technician. If your cooling needs are       
 modest, then room air conditioners are      
 probably your best choice.                  
<p> 
<b> Water Heating Systems</b>                       
<p> 
 
 Whether your water heater is gas or         
 electric, if it was exposed to flood water, 
 the unit should be replaced. A new water    
 heater is a relatively small investment,    
 and replacing it is fairly easy to do.      
<p> 
 In a gas unit, valves and controls will     
 likely corrode. In an electric unit, the    
 thermostat and controls will likely         
 corrode. In both types, the insulation      
 surrounding the unit will be                
 contaminated and will be nearly             
 impossible to disinfect. Additionally, the  
 insulation would take a long time to dry,
 leading to corrosion of the tank from the   
 outside.                                    
<p> 
 Even if water heater components have        
 been cleaned and the unit seems to          
 operate properly, parts may corrode in      
 the future. Both gas and electric water
 
 
  heaters have a pressure relief valve that
   can corrode and stick after being exposed
   to flood water. Be sure, therefore, to
   replace this valve as well.
<p> 
   Next to space heating, water heating uses
   the most energy in the home. As with
   furnaces, new energy-efficient models are
   available. Insulation levels in new gas
   and electric water heaters are higher
   today than in the past. Some utilities
   offer rebates on their purchase. You may
   even be able to get a package deal from
   your heating supplier on a furnace and a
   water heater. And, as with furnaces, you
   may want to look at the operating costs
   of electric versus gas water heaters.
   Depending on your electric rates and
   availability of gas, a gas water heater can
   be cheaper to operate.
<p> 
   Remember, too, that many different
   measures are available to reduce hot
   water consumption and thereby decrease
   water heating costs. For example, low-
   flow shower heads use 1 to 4 gallons per
   minute (gpm), compared to standard-
   flow shower heads, which generally use 5
   to 10 gpm. A shower head flow restrictor
   can save as much as 6 gpm. Similarly,
   insulating hot water pipes in your home
   can reduce the amount of energy (and
   water) lost while waiting for water to
   become hot at the tap.

<h2>Appliances                                  </h2>
 
<p> 
 <b>Large Appliances</b>
<p> 
 Large appliances include stoves,            
 refrigerators, freezers, washing machines   
 and dryers. Evaluate these items one-by-    
 one and determine whether it is more        
 prudent to salvage or replace them. In all  
 cases, there are some general guidelines    
 to follow.                                  
<p> 
 <b>Stoves</b>                                      
<p> 
 With stoves, an assessment by a qualified   
 appliance technician will help the          
 homeowner decide if it is better to         
 replace or to refurbish the damaged         
 stove. As a start, disconnect the stove     
 and remove the back cover to expose
 portions of the insulation. Allow the       
 insulation to dry thoroughly before         
 turning the stove on.                       
<p> 
 If the controls and rheostats have gotten   
 wet, have them replaced. With gas           
<p> 
 stoves, you should always replace the       
 pilot orifices and gas control system if    
 water was present. The interior surfaces    
 must be cleaned and disinfected. Once
 the stove is operable, an extended "bake    
 out" period is recommended. The high        
 operating temperature of a stove will       
 help eliminate residual moisture that       
 could cause later problems.
<p> 
 If your refrigerator or freezer was         
 submerged in flood water, these             
 appliances should be replaced.              
<p> 
  <b>Refrigerators and Freezers</b>
<p> 
   Refrigerators and freezers contain
   insulation that could be wet if the units
   were under water. This insulation is
   difficult to reach without destroying the
   cabinet of the unit. It will dry very
   slowly since the cabinet walls remain
   relatively cool while the appliance is on.
   Mullion heaters in some refrigerators,
   which eliminate condensation, are of
   further concern in water-soaked cabinets
   because they present a shock hazard.
   Further, the slow dry-out of the
   insulation in refrigerator/freezers is
   conducive to the formation and growth
   of bacteria carried between 
   the walls of the cabinet by the flood. This also
   presents a health hazard.
<p> 
   Refrigerators alone can account for as
   much as 15 percent of a home's energy
   budget, so replacing an old unit with a
   newer energy-efficient one can save
   considerable amounts of money and
   energy. A typical new refrigerator with
   automatic defrost and a top-mounted
   freezer uses about 800 kilowatt-hours
   (kWh) per year; a typical 20-year-old
   model uses about 2,000 kWh per year.
<p> 
   When shopping for a new refrigerator,
   keep in mind that different features can
   have an impact on energy consumption.
   For example, side-by-side refrigerator/
   freezer units typically consume about 18
   percent more energy than units with a
   top-mount freezer. Of course, larger
   units consume more than smaller ones,
and units with automatic defrost tend to    
 use more energy than their manual           
 defrost counterparts. Select an energy-     
 efficient refrigerator with only the        
 features that you need. The expected        
 long life of refrigerators coupled with     
 high efficiencies available in the newer    
 models will produce savings to the          
 homeowner for years to come.                
<p> 
 
 If flood water covered only a few inches    
 of the kitchen floor, it is likely that the 
 insulation for refrigerator/freezers is dry,
 and you will only need to check the         
 refrigeration system along the bottom       
 and back of the unit. Like heat pump        
 and air conditioning units, the             
 refrigeration system is sealed in           
 refrigerators and freezers. Unless
 punctured during the flood, they should     
 be in good shape.
<p> 
 Check all electrical controls including the 
 defrost timer, thermostats and other        
 safety interlocks in refrigerators and      
 replace them if there is significant water  
 damage.                                     
<p> 
 <b>Washers and Dryers</b>
<p> 
 As with other appliances, clean, dry and    
 disinfect your washing machine and          
 dryer and have an electrician or            
 appliance technician check all electrical   
 contacts and connections. Replacement       
 of the timer controls of these units will   
 likely be necessary.                        
<p> 
 If you decide to replace your clothes       
 washer, you should be aware that most of    
 the energy used by washing machines is      
 
 
 
  used to heat the water. Look for
   machines that offer several water
   temperature selections for both the wash
   and rinse cycles. A load of laundry
   washed and rinsed in hot water can cost
   as much as 20 times more than one using
   cold water for both cycles. Also look for
   machines that allow you to select
   different water levels.
<p> 
   If you decide to replace your clothes
   dryer, you should be aware that newer
   models are able to sense dryness and
   automatically shut off. Compared with
   the older models, which operate on a
   timer, these new models can save
   between 10 and 15 percent on energy
   costs.
<p> 
   <b>Dishwashers</b>
<p> 
   As with other appliances, clean, dry and
   disinfect your dishwasher and have an
   electrician or appliance technician check
   all electrical contacts and connections.
   Replacement of the timer control system
   will likely be necessary.
<p> 
   If you need to replace the dishwasher,
   consider a new energy efficient model.
   Most dishwashers today use about 8 to 14
   gallons of water per wash. Most of the
   energy used by dishwashers goes toward
   heating water, so units using less water
   also use less energy. Many dishwashers
   available have energy-saving features,
   such as "no heat" drying cycles and light
   wash cycles, which can save both water
   and energy. Units equipped with booster
   heaters will heat water to the higher
   levels necessary to adequately clean and
disinfect dishes (generally 140 degrees F). 
 This feature allows you to keep your        
 water heater at a lower setting, thus       
 reducing your household water-heating       
 costs. For each ten degrees you can         
 reduce your water heater temperature,       
 you will save about 3 to 5 percent.         
<p> 
<b> Small Appliances</b>
<p> 
 You will need to unplug, clean, dry, and    
 disinfect small appliances including        
 microwave ovens, TV's, etc. inside and      
 out. Examine them carefully and             
 determine whether to repair or to replace   
 them. In some cases, simply drying the      
 entire unit with careful attention to the   
 electrical parts will be enough. Allow an   
 extended drying time before testing the     
 appliance.                                  
<p> 
 <b>Lighting</b>
<p> 
 Incandescent bulbs are the most common
 source of lighting in American homes,
 and they waste a lot of energy. Ninety
 percent of the energy consumed is
 dissipated as heat. Fluorescent lamps
  have much greater efficiency than
   incandescent lamps, especially when
   combined with the high-efficiency
   electronic ballasts now on the market.
   Compact fluorescent lights are available
   that can replace incandescents using the
   same fixture, and save considerable
   energy for the same light output.
<p>
   Compact fluorescent lamps are more
   expensive than incandescents, costing
   about $15 to $20 each. But they last much
   longer and use a great deal less electricity.
   Depending on how long your lights are
   typically on each day, installing compact
   fluorescents could save you quite a bit of
   money over time. And, if your utility
   offers rebates that lower the initial cost of
   these lamps, they'll pay for themselves
   even more quickly.

<h2>Part 4: Summary</h2>
 
 The ravages of a flood will require you to  
 replace some, if not all, of the major      
 heating and cooling equipment in your       
 home and replace some of the building       
 components.                                 
<p> 
 In cases where replacement is the best      
 solution, selecting equipment or            
 components with higher energy               
 efficiency can often be accomplished at     
 relatively little additional cost. Often the
 improved energy conservation features       
 used in rebuilding the home's shell will    
 allow downsizing of some of the heating     
 and cooling equipment to the point
 where the additional costs, if any, of      
 higher efficiency equipment is offset by    
 savings from buying a smaller system.       
<p> 
 Energy conservation will add substantial    
 value to the house and will provide         
 increased dividends to the homeowner in     
 reduced utility bills, especially if fuel
 costs rise in the future.                   
<p> 
 Perhaps the major question left involves    
 financing, or from the homeowner's          
 point of view, "Improved energy             
 efficiency sounds fine, but how can I pay   
 for it?" Many sources of funds and
 techniques are available and should be      
 explored to reduce the cost of adding       
 energy efficiency in homes which are        
 being rebuilt after flooding. Some of       
 these are listed below.                     
<p> 
 <i><b>Utility rebate programs.</i></b> Many utilities     
 offer incentive programs that promote       
 residential energy conservation. These      
  programs range from outright subsidies
   to offset the additional costs of high
   efficiency systems, to low (perhaps zero)
   interest loans that are repaid in
   installments added to your monthly
   utility bill. By installing an energy-
   efficient system in a home, the energy
   costs are smaller than before. These
   reduced energy costs, even when
   combined with an interest payment for
   amortizing the loan from the utility,
   frequently result in a monthly utility bill
   that is lower overall than the pre-flood
   bill.
<p>
   <i><b>Low-interest home improvement loans.</i></b>
   Current low interest rates make home
   improvement loans more attractive than
   in the past. The avoided costs from
   energy savings will help to offset
   principal and interest payments to
   service the loan.
<p>
   <i><b>Disaster relief programs.</i></b> Funds may be
   available through disaster relief
   programs. Remain aware of disaster
   relief efforts and discussions between
   local, state and federal organizations and
   authorities.
<p>
   <i><b>Bulk purchase buying.</i></b> Flood damage is
   usually widespread. Consequently, your
   equipment replacement needs will
   probably match those of your neighbor.
   Therefore, you may be able to save by
   purchasing similar energy-efficient
   equipment in bulk quantities by
   coordination with neighbors, insurance
   companies, and neighborhood
   associations.
<p>
<i><b>Energy-efficient mortgages.</i></b> If you do       
 consider adding energy efficiency           
 measures to your home, you may qualify      
 for a special mortgage that rewards such    
 features based on the idea that your        
 energy payments will be lower as a result
 and you will be a better credit risk.       
 While these mortgages may slightly
 increase the amount of monthly              
 payments, they will also extend your        
 ability to borrow. These mortgages are      
 offered through four federal lending
 agencies. Check with your local bank for    
 more details about how to qualify or how    
 you can apply for an energy-efficient
 mortgage.                                   
<p> 
  Finally, after a natural disaster where
   major rebuilding is necessary, be wary of
   opportunists who will come into the area
   trying to make a fortune from your
   misfortune. Be a cautious consumer.
<p>
<ul>
   <li>    Hire licensed contractors.<p>
   <li>    Always ask for references from
        previous customers, or check with
        consumer protection agencies.<p>
   <li>    Don't sign any contracts if you have
        doubts.<p>
   <li>    Don't pay for work in advance.<p>

<h3>Appendix 3: Comparing Heating Fuel Costs</h3>
 
<p> 
 <b>Choosing Fuels</b>                              
<p> 
 People decide to switch fuels or heating    
 systems usually for economic reasons.       
 They feel that their current heating        
 system is costing too much money.
 Sometimes people feel that their existing   
 heating system is inefficient and should    
 be replaced. Or, they are choosing a        
 heating system for a new building. At       
 the same time they wonder, "What fuel       
 should I choose for my new heating
 system."                                    
<p> 
 
 <b>Useful Heat</b>                                 
<p> 
 Useful heat is the heat that reaches the    
 living space providing comfort to the       
 occupants of the space. Useful heat is      
 always less than the potential heating
 value of the fuel because heat is wasted    
 in the combustion process, in the           
 heat transfer process and in the delivery   
 process. As the efficiency becomes less     
 the cost of useful heat becomes greater.    
<p> 
 <b>The energy cost index chart will help       
 you to estimate the comparative cost of     
 various fuels.</b>                              
 
<p> 
<p> 
<ul>
   <li>   The fuels are listed at the top of
        each column on the chart and an
        assumed seasonal heating
        efficiency is listed at the bottom of
        each column.<p>
    <li>   The left vertical axis of the chart
        gives costs per one million Btus (A
        Btu or British thermal unit is
        roughly the amount of heat
        contained in a kitchen match.)<p>
    <li>   Each column contains a yardstick
        marked off in dollars or cents.
        Written in each column is the
        assumed Btu content of the fuel
        and a ratio like $/MCF or  /kWh
        that will inform you of the units
        used on the yardstick.<p>
    <li>   Natural gas, propane and oil are
        assumed to have seasonal heating
        efficiencies of 60% which is
        characteristic of central heating
        systems with pipes or ducts to
        distribute the heat. All the other
        fuels are assumed to be space
        heating systems without the
        distribution losses.<p>
   <li> See the second page for a glossary
    of terms and abbreviations.<p>
