CNN's Bill Schneider offered this prediction for '96: "Clinton
goes into his 1996 re-election campaign virtually certain to lose
next month's New Hampshire primary to Jesse Jackson."  For this
year's prognostications.

    and not have some sense that you're dealing with just an
               extraordinarily charming person."

MATCHING FUNDS:  DOLE CERTIFIED FOR BIGGEST PAYOUT TODAY

     The FEC has certified more than $37 million in matching
funds to go to 10 pres. candidates in the first pay-out for the
primaries.  The Treasury Dept. will make the disbursements today
but due to a shortfall in the presidential campaign fund, the
actual amounts sent will be less than the certified amount.  The
campaigns will receive the full allotment once the the fund is
replenished from checkoffs from '95 income tax returns.  During
the primaries, campaigns can qualify for federal matching funds
if they receive $5,000 in contributions of $250 or less per
indivudal in 20 states.  The govt. then matches contributions of
$250 or less raised by qualified campaigns.  In return,
candidates must abide by spending limits in the different states.

           AMOUNT CERTIFIED 12/27
Dole         $ 9,265,291
Clinton        9,014,645
Gramm          6,653,919
Buchanan       3,977,007
Alexander      3,226,450
Lugar          2,275,051
Wilson         1,591,393
Specter          988,976
LaRouche         261,235
Hagelin          100,000

NEW HAMPSHIRE:  DOLE RISES IN LATE-DECEMBER POLL

     16 delegates.  An American Research Group poll, conducted
12/19-22, surveyed 560 likely GOP primary voters; margin of error
+/- 4.2% (release, 12/27).

       12/19-22   12/5-7   11/8-9
Dole      42%       30%     27%
Forbes    11         9       7
Buchanan  10        13      17
Gramm      9         3       3
Alexander  6         5       6
Lugar      2         2       6
Dornan     1         0       0
Keyes      1         0       3
Taylor     1         0       0
Undec.    17        37      31

     Pollster Dick Bennett said the poll and focus groups "show
the negative advertising by Forbes aimed at Dole and Gramm has
backfired. ... Bennett said the ads have only strengthened the
loyalty of voters previously leaning toward Dole and Gramm"
(Rezendes, BOSTON GLOBE, 12/29).
     FINAL STAGE:  Manchester UNION LEADER's DiStaso writes the
NH primary "moves into its final, frenzied stage" today as NH
voters will be "bombarded" with TV, radio and mail messages for
the next six weeks (1/1).  Both Dole and Buchanan attended
Concord's famed "First Night" festivities.  300 revelers waited
in line to have their pictures taken with Bob and Liddy.  An
estimated 12,000 attended (Schmitt, CONCORD MONITOR, 1/1).

IOWA:  SIX WEEKS TO GO, LAST HURRAH FOR THE HAWKEYE STATE?

     25 delegates.  DES MOINES REGISTER's Yepsen writes for
"political addicts" it's already been a "long campaign" in IA and
the "most intense phase is just starting."  For "real people" the
campaign thus far has been "background music" and they are just
now tuning in.  It is possible '96 will mark the last time the IA
caucuses will "amount to much" as LA has successfully supplanted
IA's first in the nation status.  Up to now, "there's been little
movement.  Bob Dole is ahead."  But there is a "softness" to
Dole's support which leaves him "vulnerable."   The current
"flavor-of-the-month" challenging Dole is Steve Forbes, but
history shows such flavors "melt on caucus night for lack of
organization."  Forbes, Gramm, Alexander and Buchanan are all
"bunched up" behind Dole and anyone of them could finish second.
Polls currently show it will be Forbes, but county GOP officials
say it will "probably" be Gramm.  "The truth is, no one knows."
One thing certain: "whoever finishes in fourth place or below can
start to shut down their campaigns" (1/1).

SOUTH CAROLINA:  DOLE SLIPS, BUT SO DOES GRAMM

     37 delegates.  A Columbia STATE/WIS-TV poll, conducted
12/26-27 by Mason-Dixon/PMR, surveyed 427 likely GOP primary
voters; margin of error +/- 4.7% (1/2).  The SC primary is 3/2.

GOP PRIMARY   NOW   5/95      FAV/UNFAV    ID
Dole          40%   49%       46%/19%      100%
Gramm         17    22        35 /18       81
Forbes        14    --        34 /12       73
Buchanan       8     4        31 /32       93
Alexander      3     5        20 /11       59
Lugar          2     1        12 / 8       54
Keyes          0     0        11 / 6       44
Dornan         0     0        13 / 7       45
Taylor         0    --         3 / 5       31
Undec.        16    16

     ANALYSIS:  While Gramm "has practically moved into South
Carolina, turning it into a make-or-break state," he "has failed
to make any headway" against Dole.  Gramm SC dir. Jim Merrill
"downplay[ed] the lack of movement, saying things will turn
around when they start buying their own TV time this year":
"There's no doubt Forbes is climbing.  Let's face it: If you took
Gumby and spent a quarter of a million dollars, he would also
reflect well in the polls.  [Forbes is] kind of like a crazy
professor out there saying nice things about himself.  People
don't know that he's pro-choice, that he's probably more liberal
than Bob Dole is."  Pat Buchanan's "poor showing isn't
surprising, considering the issues driving the electorate."  The
poll shows voters are "far more interested in economic issues
than in the social issues he's more closely identified with"
(Scoppe, Columbia STATE, 1/2).
     DEBATE:  The SC GOP will hold a one-hour debate 1/6, to be
televised on CNN and WIS-TV.  At the close of filing 12/31, the
party reported Alexander, Gramm, Lugar, Buchanan, Forbes, Dole,
Taylor and Keyes will be on the SC primary ballot (SC GOP
release, 12/31).  Dornan did not file.

OTHER EARLY STATES:  A RHODE TO NOWHERE

     LOUISIANA (30 delegates):  USA TODAY's Keen profiles the 2/6
LA caucus battle between Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan.  The other
candidates have pledged to stay out in deference to IA.  GOP
activist Bryan Wagner: "Unfortunately for Buchanan, Louisiana is
located next to Texas, and Gramm has spent years doing
fundraisers and making himself known and appreciated in
Louisiana."  Buchanan predicts he'll "take delegates away from
Gramm in his own back yard": "[Gramm] came down here on the
proposition that he's the only one who can beat Dole.  Well, Phil
knows he's now in the race with an authentic conservative. ... If
we can come out of Louisiana with a dramatic showing, I think
it's all over for Phil Gramm" (1/2).  Morry Taylor and "several
Louisiana residents" filed a lawsuit to block the LA caucuses,
contending the event violates the Voting Rights Act,
discriminating against minorities by making it more difficult for
them to participate.  LA also holds a 3/12 primary, but the bulk
of delegates are selected 2/6.  IA GOP Chair Brian Kennedy
"praised" Taylor for "taking action" (Yepsen, DES MOINES
REGISTER, 12/23).
     DELAWARE (12 delegates):  Only Phil Gramm and Steve Forbes
have filed for the GOP primary so the chairs of DE's two parties
want the DE legislature to pass a law that allows the parties to
have the power to place candidates on the ballot (DiStaso,
Manchester UNION LEADER, 12/28).  At the 12/27 filing deadline,
ex-Gov. Elbert Carvel, 85, filed as the only other candidate on
the Dem primary ballot, besides Lyndon LaRouche.  Carvel is on
the ballot to keep LaRouche from winning delegates.  Carvel said
he would surrender his delegates to Pres. Clinton.  Clinton did
not file due to the state's decision to hold its primary inside
the NH's one-week "window" on 2/24.  If LaRouche were to win
delegates, the DNC would undoubtedly deny credentialling them, as
the party has not sanctioned DE's primary date.
     RHODE ISLAND (16 delegates):  Three candidates failed to
qualify for the 3/5 RI GOP primary ballot.  The official ballot,
as announced 12/28 by RI Sec/State James Langevin (D), does not
contain the names of Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes.
1,000 valid signatures were required to qualify.  The Buchanan
campaign, just 19 signatures short, said it would challenge the
decision.  The Gramm campaign said RI was not a big priority and
would focus on other states that day.   Alexander manager Dan
Pero: "The Gramm campaign has spent $20 million winning straw
polls, but it doesn't even get on the ballot in a state with real
delegates" (release, 12/29).
     MINNESOTA (33 delegates):  Dole "has largely fallen off the
radar screen" in MN, a state he won in '88.  His once "small
presence" in MN "disappeared completely" when a small office was
shut down.  Dole aides "dispute that it was even a campaign
office, but backers see the move as virtually conceding" the 3/5
MN caucuses to Phil Gramm.  MN GOP chair Chris Georgacas:
"There's no question Gramm's got a very strong organization built
down to the lower echelons of the party."  Conservative activist
Allen Quist: "Dole does not receive much enthusiasm from
conservatives" (Glover, AP, 12/30).

NATIONAL ISSUES CONVENTION:  LIST OF NO-SHOWS GROWS

     The Nat'l Issues Convention -- a four-day conference to take
place in Austin, TX 1/18-21, billed as an "experiment in informed
democracy" -- is "having difficulty wooing presidential
candidates to participate."  Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander have
already declined invitations, and a Phil Gramm spokesperson said
Gramm "likely will not participate."  Only Steve Forbes said he
would go; neither Pres. Clinton nor Pat Buchanan has announced a
decision on attending.  Univ. of TX's James Fishkin, one of the
convention organizers (along with PBS), said the NIC was supposed
to be a "social science experiment and not a candidate forum,"
with about 600 people picked randomly from across the nation to
learn about issues.  Fishkin: "The candidates who want to speak
to the concerns of the public can do so. ... We think that in the
long run we will have more participation than you think" (Walt,
HOUSTON CHRONICLE, 12/28).

DOLE:  GET READY FOR THE CAVALCADE OF GOVS

     DES MOINES REGISTER's Yepsen reports the Dole campaign is
planning a 1/6 rally in Des Moines to showcase some of the 20 GOP
gov. endorsements they have.  There are currently 31 GOP govs.
nationwide (including LA's Foster).  IA Dole manager Darrell
Kearney expects "at least" 9 or 10 govs. will attend, that will
be followed by "caucus training session" in some of IA's larger
cities to work on "boosting turnout" and generating some media
attention.  Kearney: "It's quite a coup for us to have these
governors here blitzing the state" (12/29).
     THE FEAR FACTOR:  Dole Dep. Chair Bill Lacy: "I am more
scared of this campaign making a mistake than anything the other
guys can do. ... We are in control of or own fate at this point.
I don't think there is a single thing out there that Phil Gramm
or Steve Forbes or Lamar Alexander or Pat Buchanan can do that
could sort of alter the dynamics of the race so fundamentally
that it would deny us the nomination" (Raasch, GANNETT, 12/28).
     THE AGE FACTOR:  BOSTON GLOBE's Nyhan, urging Lamar
Alexander to utilize the age issue, notes the Pope was born
5/18/20, Dole 7/22/23 (12/27).  NEWSWEEK's Fineman profiles Bob
and Liddy Dole under header, "This is their Washington life --
the one you won't see in Dole's campaign ads" (1/8 issue).
     NEW ADS:  Dole's campaign began running new ads 12/22 in NH
and IA.  IA FULL TEXT ("One of Us/Midwestern Values"; 30 secs.,
produced by Stuart Stevens) -- DOLE: "As a young man in a small
town, my parents taught me to put faith in God, not government
and never confuse the two."  ANNCR: "Bob Dole's midwest values
make him one of us.  He's fighting for our conservative agenda:
1) Demanding Hollywood stop corrupting our children; 2)
Protecting our children's future with a balanced budget;  3)
Strengthening working families with a $500 per child tax credit.
Bob Dole. The character and courage to lead America" (AP, 12/28).

FORBES:  IN PERSON AND ON THE TUBE

     In a profile, N.Y. TIMES' Kolbert notes in his public
remarks, Forbes "mentions his opponents only in passing.  But in
his commercials, he takes aim at them directly.  He was the first
candidate in the race to run negative commercials, and his media
campaign has been devoted at least as much to attacking Mr. Dole
and Mr. Gramm as it has been to touting his own ideas."  Forbes'
ad strategy "is unusual for someone so little known.  Generally,
candidates try to establish their own credentials before starting
to attack their opponents, and even some of Mr. Forbes' allies
worry privately that the approach is flawed.  But at least for
now, it appears to be having the desired impact."  GOP consultant
Sal Russo, "who has conducted focus groups for Mr. Forbes but is
not working on his campaign": "He's rewriting the Presidential
rules."  Forbes manager Bill Dal Col "predicted Forbes would do
'exceptionally well'" in DE 2/24 and "forecasted a strong
showing" in the 2/27 AZ primary, "where the Forbes campaign
appears to be breaking spending records."  Gramm media adviser
Alex Castellanos: "Nobody wants to get chased down the street by
a mad billionaire with a squash racket. ... Money can buy you
love.  But it can't buy you the Presidency" (1/1).
     LATEST ANTI-DOLE AD:  The Forbes campaign began airing a new
TV ad.  ANNCR: "A choice for Republicans on wasteful spending.
Million dollar pensions for Congress paid for by taxpayers?
Steve Forbes says no, politicians shouldn't receive taxpayer-
funded pensions.  Bob Dole says yes.  Bob Dole voted to increase
tax-payer-funded congressional pensions.  Two men.  Different
values.  Bob Dole -- Washington values.  Steve Forbes --
conservative values" (Forbes release, 12/21).
     FLAT TAX:  TIME's Birnbaum writes "the flat tax is becoming
the hottest new issue" in the race.  On 1/9, Jack Kemp's tax
reform commission "will make its own proposal to flatten the
federal income tax."  Bob Dole, a co-sponsor of the commission,
"is expected to endorse it."  The idea "is picking up so much
steam that the real estate lobby is planning" to broadcast radio
ads in IA and NH "to pressure candidates not to make their tax
plans too flat" (1/8 issue).

GRAMM:  FAULTS DOLE IN BUDGET BATTLE

     At breakfast with 150 IA supporters, Phil Gramm "criticized"
GOP leaders -- Bob Dole "in particular -- for bungling the
federal budget battle."  Gramm "said Dole ... has failed to get
the Republican Party's point across in the debate": "This is one
of those deals where virtually everything our leadership has done
has been a mistake and everything Bill Clinton has done has been
right politically. ... When was the last time you heard Bob Dole
give a response to Bill Clinton where you said, 'That hit is
exactly on the head'?  I can tell you I don't remember the last
time it happened."  Gramm added that failure to deliver the GOP
message to voters is giving Clinton the edge in opinion polls,
and may lead to his re-election: "If we're going to deliver it,
we're going to win or lose against Clinton based on our ability
to communicate with independents, conservative Democrats, blue-
collar workers, people who get their hands dirty working for a
living.  I believe I can do that.  I think there's no chance in
this world Senator Dole can do it."  He said a GOP compromise on
the budget would cause voters to lose confidence in the party:
"Republicans did not say we would balance the budget only if Bill
Clinton joins us.  We didn't say we'd balance the federal budget
if it's easy.  We didn't even say we would do it if it was
popular.  We said we would do it. ... If we don't live up to the
commitment we made in 1994, how is anybody going to believe
anything we say in 1996?" (Hartman, DES MOINES REGISTER, 12/29).
     WINS DOLE BACKERS IN IA:  Two of Dole's IA county chairs
have switched to Gramm, "who they say is stronger anti-abortion
advocate."  Dallas Co. co-chair Peggy Hermann and Warren Co. co-
chair Terri Hall "said Dole has waffled on the abortion issue."
Hall: "[Dole] led me to believe he was 100 percent pro-life --
clearly he is not" (REGISTER, 12/29).
     TRASHES THE BUREAUCRATS:  Gramm, on "Brinkley": "Have you
missed the government?  I mean, doesn't it strike you funny that
200 government -- 280,000 government employees -- are furloughed,
large segments of the government are shut down.  I think this
proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we need to go back and
eliminate another 150- to 200,000 bureaucratic positions in the
federal government."  Gramm asked whether his campaign was
"washed up": "I believe that I am in good shape in Iowa, I think
we're building a base of support in New Hampshire.  There are
only two candidates that have a nationwide organization.  There
are only two candidates that in the end can win the nomination,
and they're Bob Dole and myself" (ABC, 12/31).

ALEXANDER:  SAYS FOCUS ON BALANCED BUDGET HURTS GOP

     Lamar Alexander in IA 12/28 said the "preoccupation" of
other GOP candidates with balancing the federal budget is
"playing into President Clinton's hands."  Alexander said neither
Bob Dole nor Phil Gramm is providing voters with "a vision of
America's future."  Alexander: "We've got nobody talking about
what kind of country we're going to have or how we're going to
get there.  We've got a lot of people talking about less from
Washington and nobody is talking about more from us.  If all we
can talk about in the next year is balancing the budget, if we
have no more vision than that, Bill Clinton is going to be the
next president of the United States of America and he's going to
have a Speaker Gephardt to work with."  The budget impasse in
Washington has given Alexander a "fresh context for his anti-
Washington theme."  He stressed GOP leaders should "stand firm"
on their budget priorities, but he said he would focus on other
goals like creating jobs and rebuilding communities (Roos, DES
MOINES REGISTER, 12/29).
     "SEVERITY WITH A SMILE":  NEWSWEEK's Klein writes Alexander
"has a rare political talent, the ability to make the radical
sound reasonable."  This ability would "seem a marketable quality
in our overripe era.  But it hasn't clicked ... One problem
Alexander won't -- can't -- acknowledge is that he's chosen the
wrong central organizing gimmick for his campaign.  He is running
as that hoariest of political cliches, the 'outsider.'  It seems
a threadbare conceit, too slick by half for the '90s. ... A more
profitable route might have been to emphasize his low-key style;
a calm, smart, reasonable person in a party that seems mesmerized
by its lunatic fringe."  Still, despite his problems, the race
"may be ready for a late-breaking dark horse" and Lamar has
"begun to position himself cleverly" by "courting the GOP's
smarter cadres, the neoconservatives and 'empowerment' activists
who cluster around Newt Gingrich and Bill Kristol."  Lamar will
give a speech incorporating their ideas and offering a "New
Citizenship" this week.  Alexander "has belatedly recognized
Ronald Reagan's great secret: Republican primary voters like
their severity with a smile."  He ran "the cleverest ad of the
campaign so far" over the holidays "tweaking" Gramm and Forbes
for their negative ads and offering a "different message in
rebuttal" (1/8 issue).
     THE AD:  The 30-sec. "5th Grade" spot featured Lamar walking
between TV monitors showing the Gramm and Forbes negative ads.
The spot ran over the holidays and is now off the air.  TEXT
(produced by Murphy Pintak Gautier): "Here they go -- Washington
mudslinging.  These guys act like they are running for president
of the 5th grade.  I'm Lamar Alexander.  My campaign is
different.  In January, I'll be talking about my ideas for good
jobs, better schools, and strong citizenship.  Where we expect
less from Washington and more from ourselves.  But this week,
while the others are so busy telling you their best insults, I
have something to say to you as well.  Have a Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year!" (release 12/21).
     RESN REWIND:  In a front page story, W. POST' Marcus &
Babcock reported on the Alexander campaign's release of documents
showing the candidate raised "millions of dollars" for the
Republican Exchange Satellite Network -- which he founded in 1993
-- and that those donors "later formed the financial base" of his
campaign.  Center for Public Integrity's Charles Lewis called
RESN "a rather thinly disguised campaign mechanism" which was not
subject to FEC rules.  Alexander comm. dir. Mark Merritt called
Lewis' assertion "totally false" and said while it might have
offered him a platform, the primary purpose of RESN "was never to
elect Lamar Alexander president."  The POST ran a list of those
who gave RESN $100K or more (12/30).

BUCHANAN:  AIRS RADIO AD IN NEW YORK, WANTS TO REACH BALLOT

     Pat Buchanan released a "last-minute" radio ad attacking
NY's GOP leadership and primary process.  Only Bob Dole, who is
supported by Sen. Al D'Amato (R) and Gov. George Pataki (R) is
expected to "easily qualify" for NY's ballot.  The rest of Dole's
rivals, except Buchanan and Steve Forbes, have "written off" NY
and its 102 delegates.  Buchanan spokesperson K.B. Forbes said
the ads were designed "to boost up numbers" on petitions to reach
the ballot in each of NY's 31 counties.  The petitions are due
1/4.  AP's Humbert: "Notable is that Buchanan avoids attacking
D'Amato and Pataki ... by name in the ad. ... The late appearance
of the radio ad in select markets across the state indicates two
things:  Buchanan believes New York could be a key battleground
and he is worried about being kept off the battlefield" (12/28).
     "FACE"-ING DOLE:  Buchanan, on "Face the Nation," when asked
if he could support Bob Dole as the GOP nominee if he chooses a
pro-choice VP: "Bob Dole's a friend of mine. ... I deeply regret
that he moves around on every single issue. ... If Bob Dole picks
a liberal running mate, he will risk a real debacle at the
convention, but we're not going to have that problem because Bob
is going to be standing up there nominating me for president of
the United States" (12/31).
     WON'T BE EXCLUDED FROM WMUR DEBATE:  After announcing 12/20
that Buchanan would be excluded from a 2/15 debate, WMUR-TV
reversed itself 12/22.  Buchanan will be allowed to participate
(Manchester UNION-LEADER, 12/22).
     WON'T MISS DEFECTORS:  Responding to the defection in IA  of
Marlene Elwell and Guy Rodgers, Buchanan aides said the two are
"consultants who went to work for candidates who paid them more
 ... [but] have no knowledge of campaign secrets that might be
turned against Buchanan" (Yepsen, DES MOINES REGISTER, 12/27).

LUGAR:  MIXED REVIEWS OF BOMB THREAT ADS

     A Manchester UNION LEADER editorial: "Whoever Dick Lugar
hired to produce his latest series of TV ads raising the specter
of nuclear terrorism should be given the boot. ... The ad
campaign is a dud. ... Even as a scare tactic the ads come a
cropper.  The 'spine chilling' spots are so hokey as to be funny.
Somewhere Ed Wood is grinning ear to ear" (12/26).  W. POST
editorial: "A certain amount of the tut-tutting the ad has
occasioned seems to us misfocused.  The sensationalistic quality
of the message ... does not fit with the persona of Mr. Lugar and
diminishes him by making him look a bit desperate. ... But that
is not the most troublesome part of the story.  What's
troublesome is what the ad says ... about the apparently
universal understanding of what it finally takes to win attention
-- and support -- in politics" (12/31).

CLINTON:  A SPRING OFFENSIVE?  THE REAGAN PLAYBOOK?

     NEWSWEEK's "Periscope" reports Pres. Clinton's re-election
strategists are focusing on a likely Dole nomination and "expect
Dole ... to be cash-strapped by early spring ... and they're
hoping that moment of weakness will allow Clinton, already flush
with about $28 million, to 'do some real damage' to Dole, who
will be 'out of money and a sitting duck" (1/8 issue).  U.S.
NEWS' "Washington Whispers" reports strategists are urging
Clinton to formally announce for re-election the week before the
2/12 IA caucuses.  "The reason: to make political mischief."
They say announcements in IA and NH on 2/8-9 "would divert
publicity from the GOP.  It would also let Clinton fire a few
rhetorical shots that might capture voters' attention. ... Aides
believe that an effective theme" against Dole would be to cast
Clinton as "the future," Dole as "the past" (1/8 issue).
     REAGAN REDUX:  In an interview with AP's Fournier, Clinton-
Gore dep. chair Ann Lewis pulled out a binder entitled, "Reagan-
Bush '84, Review and Analysis," and said, "This is my Bible.
These are my secrets."  Although saying she was using hyperbole,
Lewis admitted, "I use the Reagan campaign for a lot of my
pointers.  What they did well was make it clear what Ronald
Reagan did, and why he did it."  Fornier reports one Clinton
campaign slogan "under discussion" is "Leadership for the
Future," which is meant to "create the same warm, fuzzy feeling
conjured" by Reagan's "Morning in America" (12/28).
     HAPPY NEW YEAR:  U.S. NEWS' Barone calls Clinton "The dead-
end kid": "Clinton, who campaigned in 1992 as a champion of
change, seeking to win younger voters, is now campaigning as an
enemy of change trying to scare older voters. ... His previous
arguments -- that the [CBO] numbers that were the only good ones
in 1993 need not be used in 1995, that smaller increases in
Medicare spending like the ones his wife proposed are now vicious
cuts -- cannot be sustained. ... Clinton does well enough in the
polls when voters are asked about Republican proposals.  But in
the electoral endgame 11 months from now, voters will be asking
what both parties will do, and for that Clinton has no clear
answers -- or perhaps too many" (1/8 issue).

A FEW YEAR-END THOUGHTS

     BOSTON GLOBE'S SHRIBMAN: "For Bill Clinton, 1995 was the
year everything changed -- and yet nothing did. ... He is, in
short, once again strongly positioned to conduct a political
campaign but weakly positioned to exert political leadership"
(12/28).  N.Y. TIMES' MITCHELL & PURDUM:  "Clinton ... will run
on the record of a very different Presidency than he and his
supporters seemed to imagine when the man from Hope, the youngest
President since [JFK], came into office speaking of generational
and social change" (1/2).  ANALYST KEVIN PHILLIPS writes 1996
"looks like a minefield": "With no more than a bit of bad luck,
1996 could bring a recession, an unpopular U.S. military
involvement in Bosnia and the first case in U.S. history of the
president of one party and the speaker of the other party both
facing special investigative counsel."  As for the economy, "The
recovery that began in 1991 will be starting its sixth year in
1996 -- about as long as most cycles run.  But the GOP's
unpopular budget package puts the Republicans in a position to
pay for what may be a cyclical downturn, something they should
have thought of whne they approved the script.  A 1996 recession,
occurring while the Repoublicans have grabbed the economic-policy
ball, could make the Democrats' 1994 congressional election
disaster one of the great forward fumbles of modern politics"
(L.A. TIMES, 12/31).  TIMES' "Chronicles" flips the argument and
calls Bob Dole a winner of the week: "Worst season in decades
fuels talk of slowing economy on eve of election year" (1/8
issue).  BOSTON GLOBE'S CANELLOS: "So far ... the surprise is how
mild and statesmanlike the race has been ... Candidates seem to
be fighting to claim two titles, tax-cutter -- and nice guy.
Wedge issues are locked away, at least for now" (1/2).  BOSTON
GLOBE'S LEHIGH rates the GOP pres. candidates on the "substance"
of their candidacies:  Alexander "D";  Buchanan "A-";  Dole "C+";
Forbes "B-";  Gramm "B";  Lugar "F" (12/24).
     ELECTORAL COLLEGE COUNT:  W. TIMES' Lambro sees the GOP
nominee with a 197-153 electoral vote edge over Clinton.  But
when leaning states are added, the count is tied 242-242, with 54
EVs considered "tossup."  Tossup states: WA, IL, OH (1/2).

WHITEWATER:  WHILE YOU WERE AWAY ...

     NEWSWEEK's Hosenball & Isikoff report that one month after
Bill Clinton's election in '92, Tyson Foods general counsel James
Blair, the family friend who assisted Hillary Rodham Clinton in
her highly lucrative cattle futures investments in '79 and a
member of a "defensive research team" to fend off Whitewater
allegations, loaned Jim McDougal $1,000 so that McDougal could
buy the Clintons out of their Whitewater investment.  Atty Vince
Foster "handl[ed] the transaction."  Blair: "I didn't think the
Clintons should go to Washington tied in to McDougal."  Blair's
loan "is one more sign of the Little Rock crowd's strange
sensitivity about the scandal that would not die."  While an aide
to Senate Whitewater chair Al D'Amato (R-NY) said Clinton may
have violated financial disclosure laws by failing to report
Blair's loan as a "gift" to the Clintons, Clinton atty David
Kendall disagreed: "The money came from McDougal.  Legally,
there's no issue."  But just-released notes from a 11/93 meeting
by then-WH Assoc. Counsel William Kennedy say, "Blair could have
knowledge.  Could be source of money to allo McD to purchase
stock."  Writes NEWSWEEK, "The emerging record suggests that the
Clintons' friends were worried about something -- and the
behavior of the First Couple's advisers, both before and after
Foster's suicide, looks like a bungled cover-up" (1/8 issue).
     MCDOUGAL TO D'AMATO:  After a federal court refused
McDougal's demand that D'Amato "be subpoenaed to answer questions
about his Senate probe," McDougal called D'Amato a "crook,"
adding that he was disappointed D'Amato wasn't coming to Little
Rock "because nobody in Arkansas has seen a member of the Mafia."
He challenged D'Amato "to dueling lie-detector tests" that would
cover D'Amato's past ethics problems and "mob ties" (Galvin, N.Y.
POST, 12/29).
     NEW SUBPOENAS:  The Senate Whitewater cmte issued subpoenas
to hear from 16 Arkansans, including Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (D) and
Jim and Susan McDougal.

GINGRICH:  A HAPPY NEWT YEAR?

     Speaker Newt Gingrich, appearing on CNN's "Evans & Novak,"
was asked about his high disapproval ratings: "If I were the
person they see in seven-second sound bites, I wouldn't like me
either" (12/30).  U.S. NEWS' Borger writes, "The professor needs
time to explain himself, but that is not how his world works.
Unless the networks invent the 35-minute sound bite, Gingrich
will remain difficult to stomach" (1/8 issue).  Gingrich, on the
Air Force One incident: "There's no question that there are times
that I describe that were like throwing an interception straight
into the other team's defense.  And on several occasions, and
that's one, I did things that weren't wise."  Gingrich, on what
he will do differently in '96: "Listen more carefully and try to
be more precise in what I'm saying. ... I think, frankly, I'm
going to work harder at interacting with individual editors and
individual reporters to try to see if we can't get our story
through, if by no other means, than just embarrassing them into
being professional."  Commenting on the president's persona,
Gingrich said that it is "almost impossible to be in a room with
Bill Clinton and not have some sense that you're dealing with
just an extraordinarily charming person" (CNN, 12/30).
     FROSH FOLLOWERS:  Rep. Zach Wamp (R-TN), asked whether
Gingrich has the freshmen's "proxy" in the budget negotiations:
"The Republican freshmen are the ones that have forced the
principal issues time and time again.  And the leadership has
come back to us, over and over again, and said: what will you
agree to? ... If we stick to the agenda of the Republican
revolution, not the personality of the speaker or the president
or other personalities, we're going to win because we're on solid
ground."  Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI), asked if he was prepared to
go the last mile for Gingrich: "I always look at Speaker Gingrich
kind of like I look at a basketball team, where Speaker Gingrich
is the point guard, and maybe [House Budget Chair] Mr. Kasich and
Gingrich together are the point guard on this team.  The rest of
us make up the rest of the team" ("Meet the Press," NBC, 12/31).

OTHER STUFF:  SCHUNDLER SPILLS THE BEANS

     AT THE RENAISSANCE/DARK AGES WEEKENDS:  Pres. and Mrs.
Clinton arrived in Hilton Head, SC on New Year's Eve in time to
keep their 12-year streak of attending the event alive.  Perhaps
the most interesting revelation of the weekend came from Jersey
City Mayor Bret Schundler (R).  NEWSWEEK's Kosova reports
Schundler "sheepishly admitted he had cut taxes too quickly,
leaving his city with a budget shortfall" (1/8 issue).   About
1,200 attended Renaissance Weekend; about 300 attended the new
GOP-only "Dark Ages Weekend" at Miami's Doral Golf Resort,
organized by DC attys Laura Ingraham and Jay Lefkowitz.  Guests
received a set of rules including: "No group hugs" and
encouragement for wearing furs and using chlorofluorocarbons
(Burleigh, TIME, 1/8 issue).
     RUSH:  L.A. TIMES' Randolph reported "there is a faint whiff
of trouble" in Rush Limbaugh's "formidable kingdom."  Program
managers at radio stations that carry Limbaugh's show "have begun
complaining about a slight dip" in his ratings.  Why?  "In sum,
he is now a member of the conservative political establishment;"
the outsider is now an insider (12/28).

1996 PREDICTIONS

     GEORGE WILL: "The Republicans will gain seats in the House
and the Senate and will have enough to pass a balanced budget
constitutional amendment."
     SAM DONALDSON: "There'll be a serious effort to say NATO no
longer needs to exist because the Soviet Union doesn't exist."
     JIM WOOTEN: "If nothing goes badly wrong [in Bosnia], Bill
Clinton does not profit from that.  That becomes a kind of
political wash.  If something goes wrong, Bill Clinton is
seriously damaged by that" ("Brinkley," ABC, 12/31).
     DAVID BRODER: "I'm afraid that we may be in for another
negative campaign year, with a lot of talk about character and
age, and things that are a lot less important to most Americans."
     WILLIAM SAFIRE: "The Democrats are going to try to make the
issue abortion and gun control, and divide the Republicans on
that.  I don't think the Republicans will bite.  I think they'll
fuzz it up."
     ANDREA MITCHELL: "I wouldn't bet the ranch on this being a
Clinton-Dole race.  Republicans are getting increasingly nervous
about Bob Dole's ability to defeat a revitalized Bill Clinton.
 ... Since none of the other Republican candidates look like
winners, I wouldn't rule out ... Colin Powell."
     CHARLIE COOK: "You'll see Republicans picking up two to four
seats in the Senate, minimal changes in the House ... and a
presidential election between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole that will
be much, much closer than it looks right now."
     AL HUNT: "The presidential race will be very close -- that
Bill Clinton and the Republican nominee will go right to the
wire.  I also suspect there will be, at least, a third-party
candidate, probably Mr. Perot, and maybe one or two others."
     LISA MYERS: "Two of the biggest issues in 1996 will be
leadership and character, which is one reason I think Senator
Dole has a lot better chance against President Clinton than a
whole lot of people now think."
     PAUL GIGOT: "The big issue of 1996 is going to be character
-- President Clinton's and the country's. ... 1996 is going to
show that Dan Quayle was a man ahead of his time when he put
these issues on the table, or tried to, in 1992."
     JACK GERMOND: "If we assume that Bosnia doesn't go sour,
which would probably destroy the president's chances of being
re-elected ... I don't think the campaign of '96 is going to turn
on any of the things they're talking about now -- not the budget
or foreign policy. It's going to turn on Clinton's ...character."
     JAMES CARVILLE: "In the vice presidential selection -- my
prediction is Dole is going to pick John Engler of Michigan."
     JIM MIKLASZEWSKI: "Even though he says he's not interested,
Colin Powell will be Dole's running mate.  There could be as many
a four candidates on the ballot, including two independents. ...
As long as the economy's good and Bosnia and Whitewater are
quiet, he's still the favorite, because Bill Clinton is still the
best campaigner to ever hit the White House" ("Meet the Press,"
NBC, 12/31).
     KEN DUBERSTEIN: "Big political story of the year is going to
be the House freshmen and that they will by and large be re-
elected. ... Bob Dole is going to be elected president. ... No
Democrat, with the exception of Jimmy Carter in 1976, has gotten
more than 45.6 percent of the vote.  Bill Clinton can't get above
that, period."
     FRANK RICH: "I have to go with conventional wisdom and say
it looks pretty good for Clinton right now" ("Face the Nation,"
CBS, 12/31).

ILLINOIS:  DURBIN CHALLENGES KRISLOV PETITIONS

     Rep. Richard Durbin (D-20) has asked state election
officials to bar Clinton Krislov (D), a millionaire atty, from
the ballot because of "alleged wholesale nominating petition
irregularities."  Krislov filed 10,080 signatures by the 12/18
deadline and Durbin is challenging 9,200 of them.  Krislov called
the allegations "evidence that his candidacy was giving the
jitters" to Durbin (Secter, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/27).  More
Krislov: "I am the only serious candidate in this race who is 100
percent pro-choice, no restrictions."  He said Durbin, "who now
says he is pro-choice, 'voted 25 times with the radical right' on
abortion issues."  Durbin "has said he went to Congress as a pro-
life candidate, but switched to pro-choice in part because he
found that some pro-life advocates there were also against family
planning to reduce the number of abortions" (Schoenburg,
Springfield STATE JOURNAL-REGISTER, 12/28).  Other Dems: ex-
Treas. Pat Quinn, p.r. exec. Ron Gibbs, businessman Paul Park,
and Jalil Ahmad.  GOPers: LG Bob Kustra, state Rep. Al Salvi,
radiologist Robert Marshall, Wayne Kurzeja, and Martin Paul
Gallagher.  Primary: 3/19.

KANSAS:  FRAHM FROWNS ON SENATE BID

     LG Sheila Frahm (R), a moderate, said she would not run for
the seat being vacated by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R): "The right
thing for me to do in 1996 is to continue to serve my state as
lieutenant governor."  Frahm's decision leaves conservative state
Sen. Eric Yost (R) as the only announced candidate (Petterson,
K.C. STAR, 12/27).  Frahm acknowledged that her decision "leaves
the moderate wing of the Republican Party without a candidate":
"It's a very difficult decision. ... If I was the moderate
candidate, maybe there are others who were hesitant and may be
interested in stepping forward" (AP/WICHITA EAGLE, 12/27).
Possibles: frosh Rep. Sam Brownback (R-02), real estate exec/'90
gov. primary cand. Nestor Weigand (R), retiring Rep. Jan Meyers
(R-03), Treas. Sally Thompson (D), stockbroker Jill Docking (D),
and Dole aide Dan Stanley (R).  Filing deadline: 6/10.

LOUISIANA:  TAUZIN WON'T RUN, SHAKES UP POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

     The battle for the seat being vacated by Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston (D) was "turned on its ear" by the decision of Rep.
Billy Tauzin (R-03), a recent GOP convert who was considered the
"leading" Republican candidate, not to run.  Tauzin was seen as a
likely candidate when he switched parties in 8/95, but "said he
decided to stay out of the race because he is up for a key
chairmanship in the House": "I have been looking at the race for
some time, but there has been a new development."  He said the
retirement of Rep. Jack Fields (R-TX) "puts him in line" to chair
the subcmte on Telecommunications and Finance, which he called
the "most important subcommittee post in the House."  Tauzin said
he has been assured by the GOP leadership that he will head the
panel, assuming of course he wins re-election and the GOP
maintains control of the House.  Tauzin: "I think I can help
Louisiana better in that position than as a freshman senator.
The decision is best for me, personally, too."  The decision came
just three days after the release of a poll conducted of 800 LA
voters by Southern Media & Opinion Research, which showed Tauzin
and outgoing Treas./'95 gov. hopeful Mary Landrieu (D) the
"front-runners" in the race: Landrieu received 19% to Tauzin's
14%, with 22% undecided.  AG Richard Ieyoub (D) got 12%, with
everyone else in single digits (Wardlaw, N.O. TIMES-PIC, 12/27).
     OPEN THE GATES:  Rep. Jimmy Hayes (R-07), like Tauzin a
recent GOP convert, said he would get in and insisted he wasn't
dismayed by early poor numbers: "When I first ran for Congress,
my poll was 2 percent.  I won with 57 percent of the vote.  But I
ran when I thought I could win.  I wasn't interested in the
competition" (AP, 12/27).  Baton Rouge consultant Bernie Pinsonat
said that the election of Gov.-elect Mike Foster (R) "proved that
there's no longer any penalty for party-switching."  Ex-Gov. Dave
Treen (R), who flirted with the '95 gov. race, said he is
"interested if he can take care of the business obligations that
caused him to get out" of the gov. campaign.  Rep. Bob Livingston
(R-01), who had considered a Senate bid until he was named House
Appropriations chair, said Treen will be the "front-runner if he
gets in."  Also announced is ex-state Rep. David Duke (R), who
hasn't run for office since he "fared poorly" in the '92 GOP
presidential primaries.  State Rep. Woody Jenkins (R), the
"darling of religious conservatives" who has twice run for the
Senate, is interested in running, as are New Orleans
Councilmember Peggy Wilson (R) and oilman Pat Taylor (R).  Taylor
had announced but then withdrew because of illness; Livingston
"said he is recovering and may change his mind."  Ex-Gov. Buddy
Roemer (R) "has long wanted" a Senate seat, and some of his
backers "urged him to sit out the 1995 governor's race and wait
for the 1996 Senate race."  But Roemer ran and finished fourth.
No Republican has won a Senate seat in LA since Reconstruction.
On the Dem side, Landrieu said she is looking at the race, "but
at this time I'm leaning against it."  Rep. Bill Jefferson (D-02)
said he would run for the Senate when he pulled out of the gov.
race last summer, "but he would have to leave a safe House seat
to do so."  Pinsonat "said he thinks Fields will more likely"
run, especially if he loses in his battle to keep his CD intact
(Wardlaw, TIMES-PICAYUNE, 12/28).  Other possible cands.: Rep.
Richard Baker (R-06) and Insurance Commis. Jim Brown.

MASSACHUSETTS:  WELD DOES AN ABOUT-FACE ON PACS

     Gov. Bill Weld (R) is "tossing aside some of his political
principles" by agreeing to accept PAC funding for his race
against Sen. John Kerry.  Weld said in 9/93 that PACs "just try
to buy influence and buy incumbents. ... I'd like to see an end
to this type of money funding" in MA.  Now Weld is justifying his
switch on the grounds that Kerry -- not a "paragon of
consistency" either -- "refused to agree" to a $5M campaign
spending cap.  Kerry, a "self-styled advocate of campaign
reforms," has in the past promoted spending caps (BOSTON GLOBE,
12/24).

SOUTH CAROLINA:  STROM NOT STRONG IN NEW POLL

     A Columbia STATE/WIS-TV poll, conducted 12/26-27 by Mason-
Dixon, surveyed 427 likely GOP primary voters; margin of error
+/- 4.7% (STATE, 12/31).  Tested: Sen. Strom Thurmond (R), ex-
Gov. Carroll Campbell (R) and Sec/State Jim Miles (R).

THURMOND SHOULD ...
Not seek another term    59%
Run for re-election      33

WILL YOU VOTE FOR THURMOND IN PRIMARY?
Consider voting for someone else   56%
Will vote for Thurmond             44

PRIMARY MATCHUP
Thurmond       40%            Thurmond  53%
Campbell       37             Miles     26
Miles           8

     ANALYSIS:  Although the poll shows Campbell within the
margin of error of Thurmond, Campbell insisted he will not run
against him: "I'm for Strom Thurmond.  As long as he runs, I
support him."  Miles "is more elusive" about his plans.  When
asked the chances of his entering the race, Miles "side-stepped
the question entirely."  Although Miles "couldn't topple"
Thurmond, "his interest could spur others to run.  Associates say
Campbell will jump into the race if Miles does" (Scoppe, Columbia
STATE, 12/31).  Southern political analyst Earl Black: "The only
way for Republicans to lose that seat is for the Senator to go
for one more term when his day is past. ... People are looking
for somebody younger."  Although only educator Charlie Thompson
has entered the GOP primary, Miles, "a maverick Republican, is
believed to be positioning himself to run."  Miles recently
mailed a "cleverly worded fund-raising letter saying" SC's next
senator will be one "who can energetically advance the
conservative values of our state."  Left unsaid in the letter is
whether the next senator will be elected in '96 or '98 (Bandy,
STATE, 12/31).  Announced Dem: businessman Elliott Close.  Filing
deadline: 4/30.

ILLINOIS:  FILING DEADLINE 12/18, PRIMARY 3/19

     4th CD:  Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D) gets a primary challenge
from John Holowinski (D).
     5th CD:  Frosh Rep. Michael Flanagan (R) will face primary
challenges from Chester Hornowski and Charles Prignano.  On the
Dem side, state Reps. Rod Blagojevich and Nancy Kaszak are
considered the favorites; other Dems to file were Ray Romero and
Eric Puchala.
     7th CD:  Retiring Sen. Paul Simon (D) has endorsed Cook Co.
Commis. Danny Davis for the seat being vacated by Rep. Cardiss
Collins (D).  Simon: "I think he has the stuff that real leaders
are made of" (Kuczka, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/18).  Other major Dem
candidates in the overwhelmingly Dem CD: Chicago Aldermen Dorothy
Tillman, Ed Smith & Percy Giles, and Cook Co. Commis. Bobbie
Steele.
     8th CD:  Don Huff (R), a political neophyte who was laid off
last summer as a manufacturing sales mgr., filed against 14-term
Rep. Phil Crane (R), calling for a "less confrontational
atmosphere" in DC and taking "more moderate positions" than
Crane.  Huff called the uphill battle a "Donald versus Goliath
fight" (Martinez, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/19).
     9th CD:  Given the large number of Dem retirements, "no one
would have second-guessed" Rep. Sidney Yates (D) if he decided to
join the crowd; Yates is 86 and was first elected to the House in
'48.  But "to the surprise, and mild consternation" of some, he
filed for a 24th term.  Atty J.B. Pritzker (D) filed but "said he
would withdraw by the January deadline if Yates remains a
candidate."  Other Dems: Terrence Gilhooly, Mark Matheney and
Seth Tillman (Pearson/Fegelman, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/12).
     10th CD:  Businessman Richard Rinaolo (R) has filed against
Rep. John Porter (R), calling for a "sweeping joint agreement to
prohibit acceptance or use of out-of-district PAC money."
Rinaolo: "It's time to stop preaching about campaign finance
reform and start practicing it. ... Porter, despite his pious
professions, has been part of the problem, not part of the
solution."  Rinaolo calls himself a "staunch supporter" of the
GOP Contract, while Porter "has alienated many Republicans by
voting against half of the Contract" (Rinaolo release, 12/26).
     20th CD:  In the race to succeed Senate candidate Dick
Durbin (D), the top ballot spots went to Bill Owens (R) and John
Glynn (D).  Also running: state Rep. Jay Hoffman (D), Madison Co.
Treas. John Shimkus (R), state official Patrick Baikauskas (R),
Sangamon Co. Circuit Clerk Carl Oblinger (R), student Dave Green
(R), atty James Zerkle (R), Rick Angel (R), and Sam Cahnman (D)
(Springfield STATE JOURNAL-REGISTER, 12/28).

MD 07:  THIRTY-TWO VIE TO REPLACE MFUME

     A record 32 candidates -- 28 Dems, 4 GOPers -- filed by the
12/26 deadline to succeed Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D), who is resigning
effective 2/15 to head up the NAACP.  The field includes state
Sens. Delores Kelley (D) & Nathaniel McFadden (D), Dels. Clarence
Davis (D), Elijah Cummings (D), Salima Mariott (D) & Kenneth
Montague Jr. (D), plus several clergy members including Baltimore
City Register of Wills Mary Conaway (D) and Rev. Frank Reid III
(D), who leads a 10,000 member church and is the brother-in-law
of Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke (D) (Zorzi, Balto. SUN, 12/27).
The seat has "historically been" held by a resident of West
Baltimore City, but with a large field and redistricting that
extended the CD further into E. Baltimore and Baltimore Co.,
nothing is certain.  The only major candidate with ties to
Baltimore Co. -- "where nearly a third of the vote lies" -- is
Kelley, who "could be the beneficiary of a race with a large
number of city candidates" because her district "straddles"
Baltimore City and Baltimore Co.  State Del. "Pete" Rawlings (D):
"It is creating a situation where [Kelley] has an excellent
chance.  Reid lives in the County, but has few political or
church ties there" (SUN, 12/26).  Mfume said he did not think he
would make an endorsement (SUN, 12/29).  Special primary: 3/5.

HOUSE HUNTING:  CHANGE OF HEART FOR BATEMAN

     TX 05:  Two Dems who were expected to run for the seat of
Senate hopeful John Bryant (D), Dallas school board pres. Sandy
Kress and atty Ken Molberg, will not.  A third potential Dem,
John Pouland, who like the other two is an ex-Dallas Co. Dem
chair, "said he is still on the fence."  Dems thought that Kress
"might have been the best-positioned to finance a Democratic
campaign."  He was expected to run in '90 when Bryant toyed with
a bid for AG.  Molberg said he didn't have enough money to make
the race: "That was the only thing that stayed in the way.  This
is a district that is tailor-made for an anti-Gingrich message"
(Stahl, DALLAS MORNING NEWS, 12/29).  Two GOPers are already
running: businessman Pete Sessions, who won 48% of the vote
against Bryant in '94, and ex-Dallas City Councilmember Glenn
Box.
     TX 15:  State Rep. Renato Cuellar (D), a 68-year old nine-
year veteran of the TX legislature, became the third Dem to
announce for the seat being vacated by Rep. Kika de la Garza (D).
Other Dems in race: atty Jim Selman and businessman Ruben
Hinojosa (AP, 12/27).
     VA 01:  Rep. Herb Bateman (R), who during the '94 campaign
said that would be his last race, changed his mind and will run
for an eighth term.  He said the GOP sweep of Congress "has made
him more powerful and effective -- and eager to stay in office."
Bateman said his "health is not an issue," but he had bypass
surgery in '89, underwent radiation for prostate cancer in '92,
and "discovered during a routine examination this past July that
he had suffered a minor heart attack without realizing it while
the House was keeping a busy schedule."  1st CD Dem chair John
McGlennon said no Dems have come forward to run but promised an
"aggressive recruiting effort" (Petkofsky, RICHMOND TIMES-
DISPATCH, 12/30).
