<h2 align=center>Support Groups for Adolescents with Learning Disabilities</h2>

<h3>by Harrison Sylvester</h3>

<p>My name is Harry Sylvester. The reason I do support groups for people
with learning disabilities is that I am very learning disabled myself.
My disability is in written language. My reading is at the 30th percentile
and my written expression is virtually zero. Because of these conditions,
I have lots of school failure experience. The kids that I work with can
identify with that very nicely. I have been doing this work for about 7
or 8 years and I have done all kinds of different groups. I've done substance
abuse, correctional institutions, and school groups. I have also done adolescent
and adult groups for people with learning disabilities. These ideas are
some of the things that have worked for me and I hope they will be helpful
to others. This paper is an edited transcript of a tape I made. The tape
is also available. </p>

<p>The purpose of this discussion is not how to run a support group. There
is lots of literature available with basic information on support groups.
I see this as information on how support groups can work for people with
learning disabilities, their specific needs, and things to talk about.
Everybody has the same problems with learning disabilities and the learning
disability is the same whether you're an adult, an adolescent, or a child.
The focus of this discussion is adolescents, although many of the needs
and suggestions are right for children and adults with learning disabilities
as well. Adolescents are having problems getting their education and they
are having social problems. 

<hr width="50%">

<h3 align=center>Getting Started</h3>

<p>One of the things that we all need to do is to discover that we are
not alone in having learning disabilities. I think one thing that happens
is all of us with learning disabilities haven't met other people with learning
disabilities so we feel quite alone. It's a wonderful experience when we're
in a room full of people and everybody is learning disabled and they're
talking about the same things you've had trouble with and experiences you've
had. It's quite different to learn about other people with learning disabilities
from this kind of experience than it is to have somebody tell you that
10% of the population is learning disabled. There's lots of people out
there and it's hard for us to relate to the fact that, yes indeed, there
are people with learning disabilities, and a lot of them. We can't begin
to really understand that until we start talking with other people who
have learning disabilities.

<p>When I meet with a group of adolescents the first thing I like to do
is have the group members tell what their names are, where they're from,
and what grade they're in. It's nice for them to do something that, is
very non-threatening and it starts them talking and participating in the
group.

<p>It is important to establish confidentiality at the beginning. By that
I mean that we can talk about a lot of things in the group, we can learn
from them, but we just can't take people's names away from the group. The
intent is that everybody learns that we do not put names to any of the
information we hear. With adolescents, one of the things we want to do
is to make sure that the parents are involved. My suggestion is that the
first meeting be conducted for both the adolescents and the parents. It
is a good way for the parents to know who the facilitators are and what
the adolescents are expected to do. This will make the parents less nervous
about who their children are working with and what they will be doing.

<hr width="50%">

<h3 align=center>Suggested Topics and Comments</h3>

<p>These ideas of things to talk about in a support group are good, but
the very best ideas are things that the group itself might like to talk
about, so the facilitator should always be exploring, &quot;Is there anything
that you'd like to talk about or any particular subject that you might
be interested in?&quot;

<p>Comment: I find it interesting that when you have a group of learning
disabled people together, there is all kinds of knowledge about learning
disabilities in that group. I think it is the facilitator's job to get
that information from the group and get everybody participating in discussing
it. On a particular subject you may find a little bit of information from
one person and something else from somebody else and as everybody talks
about it, you'll find that there's an awful lot of information right in
the group. As a matter of fact, I feel that it's a group of people that
are learning disabled who are really the experts on the subject. With a
little bit of help it is amazing the kind of information that will come
out of a group. I think I have learned more about learning disabilities
from groups than I have from other sources. 

<p><b>Special Education Services
<br></b>Most of the adolescents are receiving some type of special education
and they need to talk about this. You can have them say if they're getting
special ed services and talk about whether they think the services are
helping.

<p>Comment: With these kinds of things you can get everybody to participate.
The kids will also talk about what it's like to receive special education
services. They will tell you that there are all kinds of things involved
with the resource room; whether they like to go to the resource room, what
the other kids think about it, whether they're called dummies because they
go to a different kind of class, if they're thought of as being retarded,
how it feels to get these kinds of services, and if it helps. It's kind
of surprising sometimes the kinds of things that they'll tell you. Some
of them will be very satisfied and think they are getting somewhere and
others will have some real doubts and some very serious feelings about
the special ed services.

<p><b>Diagnostic Evaluations
<br></b>Another thing to talk about is whether they've been evaluated.

<p>Comment: Many of them will have been evaluated and they won't realize
it. Most of them, even if they have been evaluated, don't understand what
the evaluation shows and what it might mean. This is an area that I think
they need to have some help with. This can be arranged by having them get
someone to go over their evaluation with them like the school counselor
or maybe a parent or somebody from LDA who is knowledgeable about evaluations.
By the time they're in junior high school and high school these kids need
to know what their specific learning disabilities are, how they affect
their education, and what might be some good coping strategies to help
with the difficulties they have. It's kind of nice for them to talk about
this together because they begin to see that all of the kids have similar
types of problems and they don't feel quite so alone. By talking with each
other, they're going to help each other cope with some of these things.

<p><b>Types of Learning Disabilities - Academic Problems
<br>Small Motor Problems or Dysgraphia.</b> The kids don't usually understand
about small motor problems or dysgraphia. This is really something that
they need to talk about, and quite extensively, because it does bother
a high percentage of them. They often think that the reason that they can't
write well is because they're messy, they don't pay attention, and they
don't try. It's kind of a different concept to them that they have small
motor problems and they can't get their hands to do the writing the way
they want them to or writing gets to be a very cognitive process for them,
very time consuming and hard.

<p>Comment: Just this one subject is something that could go for a whole
meeting because it's very involved and they will have enough experience
with it that they can share. Have each one of them say if they have these
kinds of problems, what they're like, and what the ways are that they have
found to cope with these kinds difficulties. I find that not only the kids
don't understand about dysgraphia, but most adults don't either. Teachers
don't understand and this comes as a surprise to the kids. It's kind of
a relief to them to know what these kinds of difficulties are, that they
are not because they aren't trying, that there is a reason for them, and
it has a name. It is also a relief to know that there are lots of people
who have the same kinds of troubles.

<p><b>Executive Function Problems.</b> These kids have what we call executive
function difficulties. That means keeping their lives organized, getting
their work done, and making school come out right. One of the first things
that I do when I start to talk about this is I'll ask all of the kids if
they have a locker. Of course all their hands go up because everyone does
have a locker. The next question is, &quot;Do any of you have a mess in
your locker right now?&quot; They'll all start to laugh and everybody's
hands go back up again because most of us who have learning disabilities
have red trouble keeping things organized and getting things done. I'll
describe how the locker looks; most of them will have 6 to 8 inches of
paper crammed in the bottom with a bunch of books and stuff thrown in on
top, everything will be accumulating and nothing will be taken care of.
There'll be homework papers that are lost in the heap, assignments that
never got home to be done, and papers that never got passed in because
they got lost. All these same thing also usually apply to bookbags.

<p>Another part of the same kind of thing is that kids have real problems
with time schedules at school - getting to the right class at the right
time. They will sometimes get it all figured out so they can get around
right , but they still will have troubles having the right books and homework
with them. One of the things they will often do is carry every single one
of their books in their bookbags at all times and never go near a locker
because they can't really handle shifting things around and making sure
things work out right. With time problems, what happens is that they'll
finally get a schedule worked out so that they know where they're supposed
to be and get it working all right and then all of a sudden school might
run on a different schedule because of an assembly or something. This throws
them all off and they get lost and don't know where they're supposed to
be and they can't figure it out.

<p>Comment: The kids will start to talk about these kinds of things and
then you can get them to start talking about ways that they can help eliminate
some of these problems. It's important that they think up the ways to do
it themselves. We can't give them a recipe for organizing their school
work. They need to work out a way that's going to work for them individually
and they will start thinking about ways that they can keep their assignments
organized, make sure they get home and that they get their work done and
get it back to school the next day, and that they get it to the right class
and passed in. They will think about ways to get the right books to the
right class at the right time. All of these things are real problems for
them and they are often surprised to find that other kids are having the
same trouble. It's very good for them to start talking to each other about
these kinds of things. It makes a good topic because most everybody is
involved and they all realize that they need to do something about it,
and they are quite willing to talk about it.

<p><b>Language Problems, Academic.</b> There are many things that need
to be talked about associated with language. Questions to be asked include:
What kinds of trouble did you have learning to read? What is your reading
level? Are you making any gains? How is your spelling? I find that the
spelling seems to be a common denominator. Everybody that has language
problems, I think, has problems with spelling.

<p>Another thing that needs to be talked about is the math part of it.
I've been noticing that those who have trouble with language are apt to
have problems with early math or arithmetic. They seem to go hand in hand
so it looks to me like you have to have the same skills to learn language
as you do to learn early math. For instance, learning multiplication tables
and addition facts is a kind of short term memory work. To add, subtract,
multiply and divide, you need sequencing skills and these are somehow related
to language difficulties.

<p>I see that a big change happens in math when you get to Algebra I. Many
people who have had real difficulties in arithmetic and can't seem to do
accurate work, and can't seem to learn, when they get to algebra they will
be very successful. It might turn out to be an area that they're very strong
in. Sometimes those who can do algebra can do geometry and trigonometry
and do very well in math. So people have to be looking for these kinds
of things. I also notice that sometimes those who have been very successful
in arithmetic, get into high school and all of a sudden they are failing
algebra I and they don't have the faintest idea what's happened to them.
Everybody around them is saying, &quot;Well, you are a real, good, smart
person, if you paid attention you could do the algebra. You can do everything
else.&quot; It's the same story that we were told about language - if we
tried and paid attention we'd be able to do it. People sometimes don't
have as much understanding about the fact that we can have as much difficulty
in advanced math as we do language.

<p>I have seen a lot of people who have had a lot of difficulty with their
education when they got in high school because they couldn't do the math.
This has sometimes interrupted their high school education and prevented
a lot of people from going on to college, simply because they don't understand
what happened to them. They have a weakness in math and don't get good
instruction to help them learn. They don't understand that it's not their
fault.

<p>Comment: I try to tell the kids that it isn't their fault and that they
haven't gotten the kind of instruction needed to help them learn. It' s
sometimes a different concept for them that the difficulties that they
have had in school really aren't their fault. They are having these difficulties
because of the way they are &quot;set up&quot;. It might be that they haven't
had appropriate instruction and maybe the failure isn't theirs, maybe it's
someone else's. Sometimes these kids haven't thought about that before.

<p>These are some issues that relate to academics and some ideas about
getting started talking about them.

<p><b>Types of Learning Disabilities - Social Problems
<br></b>The other kinds of things that I work with the adolescents on are
social issues. I think that sometimes the social issues may be as important
as the academic, or even more important. The kinds of things that we start
talking about are things like: &quot;How do you make out having friends?
Do you have a lot of friends and do you have a lot of things that you do
socially?&quot; Do you think that you could do better in this area?&quot;

<p><b>Language and Social Problems.</b> Those of us having language difficulty
are apt to have difficulty making friends or maintaining friendships. I
think that one of the things that we need to talk about is the ability
to express ourselves and use language. For those of us that have difficulties,
I see them falling into several areas. One is that we are slow in processing
language so it is difficult for us to keep up with other people's language.
This makes it hard for us to keep a good conversation going. Some of us
have difficulty thinking of words and what we want to say, also making
it hard for us to keep a conversation going. Others have no problem getting
language out. It seems to run out of them forever and it's very fast and
it goes and goes and goes and sometimes it doesn't very much.

<p>Comment: These problems have to be dealt with. I think it is important
for a facilitator to recognize these problems and not be at all bashful
about addressing them in the group situation. For instance, if somebody
is running on and on and on and it's something they do all the time, they
may not be aware that they are doing it. The facilitator can be of a big
help to people to stop the whole thing and point out exactly what is happening
so they will know. The facilitator can also help those who have problems
in speaking. They have to be given plenty of time and people have to be
patient and listen. Everybody has to have a chance to speak. No matter
what their difficulty is everybody has to be patient so everybody has a
good chance.

<p>As a group we can look at our expressive language difficulties and start
to understand them better. Some of the things we can look at are: how we
make out one on one; can we talk in a small group where everybody is talking
a little bit slower; do we have difficulty in a larger group where there
are a lot of people talking. The group itself is a good place for people
to practice. This is what we need to do. We need to talk, learn to talk,
and talk about talking. The group is a good safe place to do this. Everybody
in the group can talk about their particular difficulties and maybe even
have suggestions about things that help.

<p>I find that almost everybody who has expressive language difficulties
gets a lot worse if they are stressed. Of course as we try these kinds
of things and we're in situations where we're talking about things that
we have a lots of feelings about, stress is running very high. As we begin
to understand that this is happening to us, we can get those stress levels
down. This helps us a lot.

<p><b>Eye Contact.</b> Many of us have difficulty with eye contact. It
kind of drives people crazy when we don't look at them when we're talking
to them, What is happening to some of us is that we're struggling so hard
with the language that we don't have enough capacity to look at someone's
face or it's so distracting to look at their face that we can't do both
at the same time. It's very difficult sometimes to get our language up
and out and look at somebody while we're doing it, but we can do a lot
about these things when we start to understand them and work on them.

<p><b>Executive Function and Social Problems.</b> Problems with executive
function skills are another thing that bothers us in social situations.
These are the same executive function skills that are necessary for us
to succeed in school. One of the problems is that we have a poor concept
of time. Because of this we don't do a good job of meeting people when
we say we're going to and we don't do a good job of getting things done
that we say we'll do. This causes us all kinds of problems. Another part
of the executive function problems is that our rooms tend to be a mess
and our things are not taken care of, All of these kinds of things tend
to drive other people crazy. I recently asked a young man if he had a steady
girl friend and the answer was &quot;no&quot; because he couldn't handle
the hassle of doing all of the things like calling her. He would forget
to call her and wouldn't meet her when he was supposed to. He hadn't figured
out how to do all of these things yet. I think one good thing about it
was that he did recognize that he had these problems. Now he needs to find
ways to compensate for them.

<p><b>Other Social Issues.</b> Another thing that we have trouble with
is that we don't know what is proper to wear. We have trouble picking an
outfit that looks right together and we also have problems knowing what
to wear to a particular function. A lot of the kids tell me that they can't
figure out what the latest styles are at school and if they try something
different they get made fun of or laughed at. They can't figure that whole
system out. One of the things they say is that they just wear jeans and
a sweatshirt because that's always acceptable. That's not what they'd like
to do but they can't figure out what is happening with the styles.

<p>Comment: Always keep in mind that the group will have some ideas or
some things they would like to talk about. It also might be very appropriate
for the group to do some social things together such as having a pizza
party, going on an outing, or something else, that lets them socialize
together and not just work all the time.

<p><b>Looking at Positives
<br></b>Comment: Up to this point I've talked about things that don't work
right or that we have difficulty with. We also need to spend time looking
at things that do work and things that we do succeed at. I like to spend
about as much time looking at positive things as things that we have difficulty
with. One of the things that's nice to do every meeting is to have people
identify some things that have gone real well for them. Maybe they have
done something that they have never been able to do for themselves before,
they have been able to take a stand, or they have been able to explain
something to somebody that they hadn't been able to do. Just look for the
positive things that are happening.

<p>Outside of that I also like to spend a lot of time looking at what the
gifts or the abilities are. By definition, people with learning disabilities
have to be of average intelligence or higher. If this is so, and we have
deficits in language, for example, it's a given that we have areas that
we're better than average in. A lot of time the kids have not even thought
about these areas. People haven't helped them think about these things.
People are very apt to point out the things we have difficulty with and
sometimes we don't get much positive reinforcement for the things that
we can do.

<p>I use Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences to discuss gifts and
abilities, but there are other systems to use. The important thing is that
we start looking at areas that we can succeed in and develop some knowledge
in these areas.

<p><b>Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences.</b> The first
intelligence that we talk about is &quot;linguistic&quot; or language.
This includes the ability to read, write, spell, speak and all of the language
kinds of things that most of us who have learning disabilities have a great
deal of trouble with. As I mentioned, I have found that the kids who are
good in language also do very well in early math, arithmetic. Many times
those of us who have language troubles also have trouble in arithmetic.

<p>The second intelligence is <b>&quot;mathematical, logical&quot;.</b>
I find that the mathematics we are talking about here is are advanced and
I'm not sure just where it starts, but when people get to Algebra I they
are there. Sometimes when students with this ability get to Algebra I,
they have their first success in school. This was true for me. The first
time I had any success in school at all was when I got to algebra.

<p>Another area is <b>&quot;spatial abilities&quot;.</b> This is the ability
to picture things in your mind as they really are. Kids with this ability
ran do very well with blueprints and they can visualize things and put
them together and make things work. They do very well with lego sets. They
like construction toys. They can draw. They just generally just like to
make things.

<p>Another area is <b>&quot;musical ability&quot;.</b> Some of the kids
that I work with will have a terrible time in language, but they can hear
a song on the radio just once and pick it out on their guitar or play it
on a piano. They retain all of that and it works very well for them.

<p>Another ability is <b>&quot;body kinesthetics&quot;.</b> That is the
ability to do things physically. All of our athletes have good body kinesthetics,
as do dancers and anybody who does things physically. Sometimes those who
are having difficulty with language will excel in some sport. These things
can be talked about and people can begin to see what they can really excel
at.

<p>The next ability is <b>&quot;interpersonal abilities&quot;.</b> This
means that a person likes to work in groups and do things with other people.
They can talk with people and have a good feel for what other people need
and feel. They work well with others. Sometimes that is a real strength
for our kids.

<p>The last one is what Gardner calls <b>&quot;intrapersonal intelligence&quot;.</b>
This is the ability to understand yourself, take care of yourself, and
do the things you need to do to prosper and have good health. I think it
is very interesting that an awful lot of the kids that I work with who
have severe language problems or math problems have very poor ability to
take care of themselves and in understanding themselves. This is a very
good thing to talk about to start the kids thinking about it.

<p>Comment: This is an awful lot of information to give a group at one
time and they probably can't retain it all. What I do is go around the
group and have each person try to identify a couple of areas that they
do very well in, things that they like to do, or things that really click
for them. The facilitator will have to help sometimes to get this started
because people aren't sure what groups they fall into. You can question
a bit about the things that they like to do. Can they play a musical instrument?
Are they good in sports? What kinds of things did they like to do when
they were young? What kind of toys did they play with? You can usually
find out a couple of areas that each one is doing some things in and doing
them successfully. Then I try to have each one identify a couple of areas
that they have difficulty with, such as language maybe. Did they have trouble
learning to read and write in school? Do they still have these kinds of
troubles? How is their math? After a little discussion each person will
have some ideas about things that really work for them. One of the interesting
things is that oftentimes they have more trouble finding the things that
do work for them the things that are good, because people aren't too apt
to point out the things that we're successful at. They really prefer to
tell us the things that we have trouble with. So, usually they have a pretty
good idea of things they don't do well. After you've done two or three
people in the room, the whole group begins to understand more how it's
going to work and they participate very well. When you get done, everybody
can see that they do have some things that they can do and that they may
be very talented in. This helps people understand that they may have real
difficulties in language, but that's not the only thing in the world that
we can be smart in. There are all kinds of things that we can succeed in.

<p>This whole procedure takes a lot of time because you have to spend quite
a bit of time with each person. If the group is small, this works a lot
better because after a little while people start getting uneasy and it
drags on for a long time. What I do if I've got a big group I'm working
with, I'll ask these questions and have a show of hands. For instance,
if I am inquiring about music, I'll ask all of those who play a musical
instrument, like to sing, or enjoy music to raise their hands. Right afterwards,
I'll ask all of those who don't care for music, or they like to listen
to it, but have never had a desire to play an instrument to show their
hands. That begins to show the group that indeed there are some who are
very good in that area and there are some who have difficulties in that
area. A lot of people feel that there isn't any area that they have abilities
in and I think it is important to spend some time with those folks. They
really do have something, but they haven't had much success and it takes
a little while to discover where they might be successful.

<p>We spend an awful lot of time, energy, and money on discovering exactly
what it is that we can't do. Sometimes I think we should spend a little
more time discovering what it is that we can excel at. Sometimes these
things seem to get lost. So, I think we really do need to spend time with
these kids looking in that area. 
<hr width="50%">

<h3 align=center>Other Things to Consider</h3>

<p>I suggest that after a while, whenever the adolescents are ready, to
have another parent open house. At this meeting I would have the adolescents
explain what their learning disability is and how it has affected them.
They could also share what their abilities are and how they can use those
to help them in school. 

<p>Another topic to discuss is compensatory things we can do to help ourselves.
For instance, we can take notes with a tape recorder, use talking books,
sometimes get extra time on tests, and use word processing. Facilitators
can develop a list of compensatory things. On the other hand, there are
remedial things that can be done. For instance, with appropriate reading
programs, many of us can learn to read, spell and write a lot better. These
things need to be talked about.

<p>There are many other topics that can be discussed. For instance, a lot
of times we talk about specific types of learning disability and go in
to the real details of each one. People can learn and share that way. It
is always important to remember that the people in the group will have
topics to discuss.

<p>Another point is that a facilitator can't help people solve their problems.
The job of a facilitator is to teach people what their disability is, what
their specific learning disabilities are, and what their strengths are.
These folks will then be able to figure out what it is they need to do
and help themselves. We can't really help them directly, buy we can sure
help them help themselves.

<p>Another thing that I have found is that two facilitators can be very
effective, preferably, a man and a woman. While one is talking, the other
has a good chance to observe and come up with some other ideas. If necessary,
the two can work together for modeling and that kind of thing.

<p>These are some of the things that I have found that worked for me. I
hope you will be able to use them in some of your work.
