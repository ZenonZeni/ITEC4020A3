MALAYSIA AIRLINES GIVES BOEING $4 BILLION ORDER, SHUTS OUT AIRBUS

      Malaysia Airlines, like much of the industry recently, made an
all-Boeing choice in its $4 billion aircraft order announced Jan. 9.
The carrier purchased fifteen 777-200s and -300s and ten 747-400s.
      The order was a major disappointment for Airbus Industrie,
which had hoped Malaysia would invest in its A330 and A340 family
of widebodies. MAL currently operates eight A330s.
      The airline, a Boeing customer for more than 27 years, also
took options on three 747-400s and two 777s. Deliveries begin in
1997 and continue through 2001.
      Rolls Royce won the engine maker order from Malaysia, its
second major order in Asia to power the 777. Singapore Airlines
chose Rolls-Royce in December to power its 34 777s on order. Pratt
& Whitney won the order for 747 engines worth $400 million to the
U.S. engine maker. 
      Boeing says the Malaysia decision confirms that the "777 is an
excellent airplane for operations into and out of the Asia-Pacific
region," says Ron Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane
Group.
      He adds that the 747-400 has demonstrated its suitability to
Asia-Pacific markets, since it enables convenient, non-stop service
to distant destinations. Malaysia currently operates 65 Boeing jets,
including 15 747s and 50 737s.

 BOEING CLAIMS MORE THAN 80% OF ASIAN AIRCRAFT ORDERS 

      Asia-Pacific carriers gave Boeing Commercial Aircraft 82% of
their orders for new aircraft in 1995, a lean year for orders
across most of the rest of the world. The manufacturer counted 346
firm orders in 1995, versus 106 for Airbus and 114 for McDonnell
Douglas.
    Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 36% of
Boeing's orders last year, versus 13% for Airbus and 11% for
Douglas.
    The 226 orders for Boeing aircraft were placed by 20 Asian
airlines, from giants like All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines to
Taiwan's U-Land. And lessors are taking up a little of the slack in
airline demand: Ansett Worldwide Aviation accounted for seven new
jet orders in 1995, mostly 737-300s.
    ANA and Singapore are helping Boeing into the 21st century, with
big orders for the 777 series. Asia-Pacific airlines accounted for
more than two-thirds of the 1995 orders for the 777-200 and -300. 
    Asian airlines also helped keep the old goods moving for Boeing.
Nearly half of the orders for the traditional 737-200 and 747-400
were placed by carriers in the region.                               
    In December, Singapore Airlines gave Boeing one of its largest
orders of the year for 34 777s and a 
747-400 freighter. China Airlines ordered six 737-800s with options
on nine additional aircraft in late December. Deliveries are
expected to begin in 1998 and the order is worth an estimated $750
million. China Airlines' 737s will be powered by CFM56-7 engines,
manufactured by CFMI, a joint venture between General Electric of
the United States and SNECMA of France. The aircraft will be used
on regional and domestic routes. 
    Boeing also posted new orders from Thai Airways for two 737-
400s, Korean Air for four 777-400s, Japan TransOcean for one 737-
400, Asiana for three 747-400s and Japan Airlines for 16 747-400s
and five 777-300s and one 767 in December. 
    The JAL order for 16 747-400s announced by Boeing in its monthly
wrap up of orders and deliveries is not new, says JAL spokesperson
Morris Simoncelli. "The 16 747s are all part of our original order
for 50 jumbo jets placed earlier in the decade," he says.  JAL
deferred delivery on a portion of order several years ago and is
now ready to come up with a delivery schedule. The airline is
operating 32 of 50 747-400s ordered and deferred delivery on the
remaining 18 aircraft, he says. Delivery schedules for the 18
aircraft are expected to be announced in the next few months,
Simoncelli says.
    Airbus Industrie launched 1996 with a surge of orders from three
customers. Philippine Airlines had by far the largest order of the
four -- 24 aircraft, including four long-range A340-300 widebodies,
8 A330-200 twin-engine widebodies, and 12 A320 narrowbody planes.
BWIA International Airways, Yemenia Airways and GATX Leasing also
logged new Airbus orders. 
    Delivery of PAL's Airbus aircraft begin in the second quarter of
1997, with nearly simultaneous delivery of the first A340 and A330.
The first A320 will be delivered in the third quarter of 1997. PAL
has an additional four A340s from a previous order, which will be
delivered to PAL at the end of 1996.
    The airline plans to use the new A340s to develop its long-haul
route system, including new nonstops to Europe and North America,
Airbus says. A330s will be used on high-density Asian services and
on medium-to-long range routes as far away as the Middle East.
    PAL is also expected to order eight Boeing 747-400s valued at
$2.7 billion, but Boeing Commercial Airplane Group  has yet to
confirm it. GE Aircraft Engines confirmed Jan. 5 it has received
orders totaling $700 million from PAL for the CF6-80C2 to power
eight 747-400s and a mix of CF6s and CMF56s to power the Airbus
aircraft.  
    The number of Airbus operators increased from 123 to 131 in
1995.
    McDonnell Douglas posted 114 orders totaling $4.3 billion in
1995, a significant improvement over 1994 figures where the U.S.
manufacturer logged only 23 new orders. Asian carriers Korean Air,
U-Land and EVA Air placed orders for narrowbody aircraft, the MD-80
and MD-90.

AIRBORNE FORGES PARTNERSHIP WITH VIETNAM POST

    Airborne Express  has forged a partnership with the Vietnam
Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications to provide express and
freight delivery domestically and to worldwide destinations. 
Airborne has been operating in Vietnam since the country's
liberalization in mid-1994 and has offices in Ho Chi Minh City and
Hanoi.  
    FedEx and UPS have similar arrangements with Vietnam, but
Airborne is the only firm licensed to offer express, air freight
and ocean freight, says Bruce Grout, vice president for Asia Pacific
operations. Airborne acts as a freight forwarder in Vietnam relying
on the lift of carriers such as Air Vietnam, Singapore Airlines,
Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific to handle its cargo. To date, it has
enough capacity, but Grout sees capacity tightening as multinational
business continues to grow in the region. Express products are
growing at the fastest, he says but air freight is climbing. "[Air
freight] will just take time to grow, as it did in China." 
    "As a country Vietnam is not all that important [to the cargo
industry]. But it becomes very important if you are doing business
in Southeast Asia," Grout says. "We are starting to see a lot of
business between Europe and Vietnam." Seventy percent of Airborne's
business is intra-Asian, but the international business is growing,
he says. Footware, namely its contract with Nike, is Airborne's
primary export. Grout expects to break even in Vietnam this year
and see a profit in 1997. "But who knows? I may surprise myself
this year," he says.

INDIAN CONGLOMERATE PLANS TO BUY MAJORITY STAKE IN MODILUFT

    National Energy Processing Company (NEPC), a large Indian-based
conglomerate, plans to buy a majority stake in Modiluft, India's
second largest domestic carrier. But it faces a fight from the
airline's chairman. Sixty percent of Modiluft is owned by the Modi
family while Lufthansa German Airlines owns the remainder.
    NEPC Chairman Ravi Prakash Khemka tells Asian Aviation News he
plans to buy 30 million of the 53 million (57%) shares to gain
control of the airline, but Modiluft Chairman S.K. Modi says the
transaction is not possible without an agreement with him. Modi
warned that he would begin legal proceedings against NEPC, should
the need arise, claiming only 29% of the airline's shares are
available in the open market. 
    NEPC Airlines, which operates seven Fokker 50s and two jet
aircraft, acquired another Indian carrier, Damania Airways, in May
1995, making it the country's largest domestic operator.

KIWI SIGNS INTERLINE AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM, TURNS PURSUITS TO
ASIANA

    Tasmania-based Kiwi Air has signed an interline agreement with
Vietnam Airlines that allows Kiwi to block seats on Vietnam from
flights from Sydney to Europe and other points in Asia. Kiwi is
also negotiating with Korea's Asiana for a similar interline
agreement. Kiwi, which operates a Boeing 757 from secondary New
Zealand cities to Brisbane and Sydney, may add a second 757 next
April when flights to Honolulu commence. The airline also is looking
at introducing an Airbus A320 for New Zealand domestic flights.

ANSETT SET TO BEGIN JAKARTA SERVICE NEXT MONTH

    Ansett International is slated to begin service to Jakarta on
Feb. 12 from Sydney. The flight, initially operated with a Boeing
747-300, will continue on to Kuala Lumpur before returning to
Sydney. It is likely one the airline commences service to Seoul
mid-year, the 747-300 on the Jakarta route will be replaced with a
767-300, the first in the airline's fleet. 
    Ansett took delivery of its seventh 767-200 on Dec. 25. The
aircraft was purchased from Britannia Airlines. A major fleet re-
equipment decision is expected within the next three months which
may lead to a reduction in the number of aircraft types it
operates. Movement in that regard has already begun. It recently
scrapped three Fokker F28-1000s and intends to upgrade its F28-4000
fleet. Its Fokker 50s are being withdrawn from the Sydney-Canberra
route, replacing them with Saab 340s.

SINGAPORE AIRLINES PLANS AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION IN LEASING

    Singapore Airlines' leasing subsidiary plans to boost its
worldwide presence by acquiring a fleet of up to 30 new-generation
aircraft. "We will grow by supplying airlines on competitive terms
with the aircraft they requires, says Singapore Aircraft Leasing
Enterprise (SALE) Chairman Matthew Samuel tells Asian Aviation News.
"Building constructive long-term relationships with our airlines
customers is the key element in this strategy." 
    SALE plans to raise its capital from US$60 million to US$250
million as it expands operations. 
    The company currently has four aircraft on lease. The firm has
two Boeing 767-300ER and six 777-300s on order with options for
another 10 on the later. SALE recently took delivery of one 767-300
ER and leased it to Alitalia Airlines. The remaining 767s are to be
delivered in June.
     Samuel says that although SALE's current focus is on acquiring
wide-bodied aircraft, the company may opt for smaller aircraft on a
selected basis.

MALAYSIA AIRPORTS BERHAD CONSIDERS EXPANDING MARKETING EXPERTISE

    Malaysia Airports Berhad (MAB) Managing Director Khairuddin bin
Ibrahim says the company hopes to use the experience gained from
managing Malaysia's 36-airport system to assist airports in other
countries. 
    The company already has a contract to manage Pochentong
International Airport in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The contract was
awarded to a new MAB subsidiary, Malaysia Airports Management and
Technical Services, via a joint venture with Aeroports de Paris. 
    Malaysia Airports Management and Technical Services is being
funded through internal sources and is initially expected to consult
with Malaysian airports to improve their management operations.
Eventually, says Khairuddin, the company is looking to market its
management expertise to Indochina, Pacific, Southeast Asian and
African countries. New airport projects in Seoul and Bangkok "may be
too big for us at the moment," he adds.
    A second subsidiary, dubbed Malaysia Airports Niaga (MAN), is
charged with expanding the retail revenue base, including hotels,
parking and shops. Concessions at Langkawi Airport, for instance,
has just been tripled to 24 locations. As concessions space becomes
more available at other Malaysian facilities, MAN will compete to
manage the concessions.
    MAN is also involved in an airport supermarket at Kuala Lumpur,
and is considering forming a joint venture to branch further in
that direction. Retail revenue accounted for 30-35% of MAB's total
revenue - about $20-$23 million - in the first six months of the
current fiscal year. Khairuddin says he would like to see that
figure increase to 50% over the next five years. Marketing its duty
free expertise overseas "in the long term. . .depends on what sort
of opportunities are available," Khairuddin explains.
    MAN's position in the organization reveals an interesting
dichotomy. "They are essentially a business organization," explains
Khairuddin, that acts as a relatively independent subsidiary and
will have to compete for all concessions opportunities at Malaysian
airports. But the company also will set price controls for duty
free and retail business to fulfill MAB's goal of making Kuala
Lumpur International Airport-Subang "an airport with the lowest duty
free pricing in this region."

ASIAN STOCKS OFF IN 1995; RETAIN $49 BILLION OF MARKET VALUE

    Fresh competitive forces are loose in Asia-Pacific, even as
world business conditions revive and traffic grows at near a double-
digit pace in the region.  Reflecting the competition, several Asian
airlines lost share values on stock exchanges in 1995, in some
cases substantially.
    Japan's two giants, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, were
off 7% and 3%, respectively, in yen. Japan Air System was down even
more sharply, 15% for the year. The other major loser was Thai
Airways International, down 20% in both local and U.S. currencies.
Even mighty Singapore Airlines lost slightly. Singapore's current
financial remain very impressive, but the dominance the carrier once
had at efficient, low-cost operation will be challenged more broadly
by others.
    This challenge is coming partly from global carriers, especially
in the U.S. But the most intense pressure is likely to be from
other Asian airlines. Cathay Pacific strengthened its route system
in 1995 and received a nice appreciation in share values. Qantas
Airways got off to a decent start as a privatized airline - the
carrier's size and position make it a threat in the Southeast
Pacific. And Air New Zealand, with much more experience at fully
private management than Qantas, is not standing still. ANZ picked up
some ground on exchanges in 1995.
    The market trimmed but hardly downgraded the bright prospects of
most Asian carriers. Even after $3.45 billion in overall share
losses, the ten airlines surveyed by AAN retained a market value of
$48.83 billion Dec. 31. That is nearly 60% more shareholder value
than the much bigger U.S. airline industry had - and it does not
even include all Asian airlines.
    Competition will continue to trim some hefty margins in Asia
1996. But the basic reason for competition -- booming passenger and
cargo markets -- justifies that huge equity stake.

NEWS IN BRIEF

    China Eastern Airlines ordered two visual systems for its Airbus
A300-600 and McDonnell Douglas MD-82 flight simulators. Both of the
new VITAL ChromaView systems from Flight Safety International will
be installed in the fourth quarter of 1996. 

    All Nippon Airways chose Pratt & Whitney and International Aero
Engines to power its recent orders for Boeing 777-300s and Airbus
A321s. Both will begin joining the fleet in 1998. The engine order
is worth an estimated $400 million. 

    National Jet Systems of Adelaide, South Australia took delivery
of its first Jetstream 41 from JSX Capital Corp. National Jet
Systems is JSX's first customer in Australia. The airline also
operates a fleet of 13 BAe 146s and an Avro RJ70.

    Cathay Pacific has decided to keep its flight training school in
Hong Kong, rather than move it to Australia as previously
considered. "Several recent developments have made it cost-effective
to keep the simulators in Hong Kong," said Captain Mick Toller,
general manager business projects. Cathay has been offered land in
Hong Kong at an attractive price and plans to invest in a new
headquarters building to accommodate staff and simulator training.  

    Air Pacific began a second weekly nonstop between Los Angeles
and Figi on Jan. 9 using Boeing 747 aircraft. The first service was
inaugurated in July 1994. 

    Ansett Worldwide, the leasing arm of the Australian airline,
extended its leases of Boeing aircraft to Brazil's Rio Sul, Vietnam
Airlines  and Crocus Airlines.       

    Air Express International, the international freight forwarder,
opened new offices in Guam and Saipan through an agreement with
Clipper Cargo Corp., one of Guam's major freight forwarders. "Guam
and Saipan have both shown solid growth in exports of finished
goods and agricultural products to the U.S. and Asia," says Jeremy
Zeitlyn, AEI's vice president for the South Pacific.

    China Southern has chosen AMR Corp.'s  SABRE Decision
Technologies (SDT) to design its new airline systems control center
in Guangzhou, China. SDT will provide all computer systems and
software, American Airlines will assist in training center employees
and SABRE Computer Services will assist in developing the air/ground
communication system. The client/server system will automate many of
the functions that are now handled manually including flight
dispatch, flight monitoring, load planning and crew scheduling. 

    Sichuan Airlines took delivery of its first Airbus A320 late
last month. The A320, leased from International Lease Finance Corp.,
is Sichuan's first Western aircraft. Sichuan will use the aircraft
on routes from its Changdu base to Beijing and other domestic
destinations. The aircraft is powered by International Aero Engines
V2527 engines. 

    China Northwest Airlines will begin service from Xi'an in the
Shaanix Province of North China to Macao starting Jan. 9, Xinhua
News Agency reports. The flights, to be operated twice weekly, will
make an intermediate stop in Changsha. China Northwest is the third
mainland carrier to begin service to Macao, with China National
Aviation Corp. and China Northern now flying there.

    Air Macao will launch a daily flight between Macao and
Koahsiung, Taiwan, Jan. 12. Air Macao operates twice-daily service
between Macao and Taipei.

    Air India has begun service to Entebbe International Airport in
Uganda. The airline will operate an Airbus A310 once a week from
Bombay. Air India suspended service to Uganda in 1972 when former
Uganda President Idi Amin expelled thousands of Indians from the
country.

U.S.-CHINA ACCORD PROVIDES FIRST NONSTOP SERVICE; OPENS CODESHARING 

    Northwest Airlines will begin the first nonstop service between
the U.S. and China on May 1. Following an accord signed by the
governments of China and the United States that allows for expanded,
direct service between the two nations. One of the most important
aspects of the air services agreement is that it opens the door for
codesharing between Chinese and U.S. carriers.   
    Detroit-Beijing service will be operated by Northwest thrice-
weekly on Boeing 747-400 aircraft. The air services agreement allows
Northwest to boost weekly service to nine in 1998. Northwest's
Shanghai service was reinstated in 1984 and today the carrier
operates to the city once weekly with one stop in Tokyo.
Northwest's current thrice-weekly Beijing service was instituted in
1992 and also stops in Tokyo.   
    Northwest has a long relationship with China. It first served
Shanghai in 1947. The airline also has pilot training contracts with
five Chinese carriers -- China Southwest, China Eastern, China
Northern, Xiamen and Shanghai Airlines. 
    The air services agreement gives China the right to begin
codesharing immediately. U.S. carriers can begin codesharing three
years from the date Chinese codesharing commences. China Eastern,
Air China and China Southern among others are very anxious to see
[codesharing] begin, says U.S. Department of Transportation
spokesperson Pat Murphy. American Airlines  and Delta Air Lines 
have also expressed great interest.    
    "We have had discussions on a couple different levels with
Chinese carriers and codesharing is certainly a possibility and we
will continue to entertain those talks," says Northwest Airlines
spokesperson Doug Killian. 
    Delta has never served China, but flies to Taiwan and Hong Kong.
"We are looking at expanding codesharing to China, but we have to
look more closely at the agreement first," says Delta spokesperson
Todd Clay. "We are approached on a regular basis from carriers
around the world and we are happy that the new bilateral agreement
will offer new opportunities in China. I suspect [the Chinese
carriers] have approached every carrier about codeshare
opportunities," he adds.
    As for American, "we haven't applied for route authority because
the key to Asia for American is Japan. We would love beyond rights
to China from Japan, but that doesn't look like it is in the plans
for our government or the Japanese government," says American
Airlines spokesperson Al Becker.

EVA PARENT CONSIDERS LAUNCHING NEW PANAMANIAN AIRLINE

    Evergreen Corp., the parent company of Taiwan's Eva Air, plans
to launch an international carrier in Panama. Evergreen will boost
its involvement in Panama in part because of the connections
Evergreen Chairman Chang Jung-fa has to the Panamanian government,
sources tell Asian Aviation News. Chang was named an investment
adviser to Panamanian President Enrest Perez Balladares last year.
    Evergreen has applied with Panamanian authorities to fly to
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia. The airline has long-
term plans to operate to the U.S., Europe and Asia.
    Evergreen also has asked Panama's incumbent international
airline, copa, to become a minority shareholder in the new airline,
the sources say, but has not yet received any response. The offer
was made in November.
    The airline is expected to begin international service from
Panama by July. Aircraft being considered for the venture include
Boeing 767s and 757s and Airbus A340s and A330s.
    Eva operates long-haul service between Taipei and Los Angeles
and began direct service to Panama late last year.
