<H3>What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?</H3>

<blockquote>
  <p>ADHD is a disorder characterized by three behaviors:
  <UL>
    <LI><b>Hyperactivity</b>
    <LI><b>Distractibility</b> 
    <LI><b>Impulsivity</b> 
  </UL>

  <p>You may see one or more of these behaviors. It is not necessary to
     have all three to have ADHD: e.g., one does not have to be hyperactive.
  <p>ADHD is related, to but different than, learning disabilities (LD).
     Some people only have learning disabilities. Some have ADHD only. 
     Some have both. A number of professionals  believe that as many as
     50-80% of those with ADHD will have LD. There is an overlap. It is
     important to remember each disorder requires different treatment.
</blockquote>

<H3>What are these three behaviors?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Hyperactivity:</b>
     The child exhibits an unusual degree of activity. Most are fidgety;
     something is always in motion -- fingers, pencil, feet. They squirm
     in their seat, or cannot remain seated, etc.
  <p><b>Distractibility:</b> The child has difficulty blocking out
     unnecessary input from the environment.
    <blockquote>
    <p><b>Auditorily Distractible</b> means paying attention to all sounds,
       not just appropriate ones, e.g., voices in  halls, ringing of
       telephone.
    <p><b>Visually  Distractible</b> means paying attention to all things
       seen rather than the appropriate items, e.g., clouds, rug, pictures.
    </blockquote>
  <p><b>Impulsivity:</b>
     The child does not think before acting or talking and does not consider the 
     impact of his/her actions on others. Thus, they do not learn from experience. 
     This child may be accident prone because of impulsive behavior combined with poor judgment.
</blockquote>

<H3>Who makes the diagnosis?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Parents, teachers, and professionals may find evidence suggesting ADHD. However a physician usually confirms the diagnosis.
</blockquote>
<H3>How is the diagnosis made?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>ADHD is the least common reason for hyperactivity, distractibility
     or impulsivity. The most common causes for these behaviors are 
     anxiety or depression.
  <p>The history of the problem is the best indication. If the behaviors 
     have been chronic, that is, present almost since birth, and pervasive, 
     present all day, every day, it is probably ADHD.
  <p>Check lists and rating scales can be of assistance. However, the history 
     of the behavior combined with clinical observations remain the best 
     procedure for establishing the diagnosis of ADHD.
</blockquote>

<H3>What causes ADHD?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The final answer is not known. Current research strongly suggests that 
     ADHD is due to a deficiency in a specific neurotransmitter in the lower
     area of the brain. Research should lead to a greater understanding of 
     this disorder in coming years.
</blockquote>

<H3>How long does it last?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Current information suggests about 50% of children with ADHD will no longer have ADHD by puberty. The  remainder will continue into adolescence and possibly into adulthood.</P>
</blockquote>
<H3>How is ADHD treated?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Behavioral approaches can be attempted to help the child concentrate
     on sitting still, staying on task or thinking before acting. Most of
     these are effective for short periods of time.
  <p>Several nutritional approaches have been proposed. The Feingold Diet
     appears to work at best for 1-2% of children with ADHD. Too much 
     refined sugar can increase hyperactivity in some children.
  <p>The generally accepted treatment in this country is the use of
     medications.
</blockquote>
<H3>Treatment with medication</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Each medication has its own characteristics, effects and possible
     side effects. Thus, the physician should review these issues with
     the parents before beginning any medication. The goal is to 
     decrease or stop the behavior without side effects.
  <p>Medications have been used since 1937 and are considered to be
     safe and effective. These medications do not "drug" or "alter the 
     mind" of the child.  Rather, research suggests that each medication
     increases the amount of the chemical that is deficient in the
     brain, allowing the brain to function normally; therefore, the
     behaviors are diminished. Thus, the child becomes less active,
     less distractible and more able to think before acting.
  <p>The current approach is to use one of three groups of medications.
     The physician will generally begin with Group One progressing to 
     the others if no improvement is seen or side effects occur.
  <p>Since ADHD can interfere with classroom work, peer interactions 
     and family life, it is recommended that the child be on medication
     throughout each day, not just during school hours.

  <H4>Group One medications (stimulants) are:</H4>

  <ul>
    <li>Ritalin (methylpenidate)
    <li>Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)
    <li>Cylert (pemoline)    
  </ul>

  <H4> Group Two medications (antidepressants) are:</H4>
  <ul>
    <li>Tofranil (imipramine)
    <li>Norpramine (desipramine)
  </ul>

  <H4>Group Three medications are:</H4>
  <ul>
    <li>Mellaril (thioridazine), an antipsychotic       
    <li>Tegretol (carbamazepine), an anticonvulsant also effective for
        manic-depressive (bipolar) disease
  </ul>

  <p>Catapres (clonidine) may be used with Group One or Two medications to increase
     their effectiveness.
</blockquote>

<H3>Remember the total child: </H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Many children with ADHD also have learning  disabilities. Treating
     the ADHD will not treat the learning disabilities. Each must be
     treated if the child is to make sufficient progress.
  <p>If children have ADHD and learning disabilities they may develop
     emotional, social and family  problems. Each must be recognized
     and helped. Unless the total child, in his or her total environment
     is considered, neither the child nor the family will make as much
     improvement as necessary.
