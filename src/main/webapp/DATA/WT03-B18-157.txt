One of the many 'bricks in the wall' of the urban nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emission controls cost-effectiveness evaluation for the Auto/Oil Programme
(see CONCAWE Review Volume 4, Number 2, pages 10 and 11) was the definition
of the costs of modifying road transport fuels, i.e. gasoline and diesel
fuels, in ways which would provide improvements to the emissions of the
vehicle fleet, i.e. cars, trucks, buses, etc. As the project manager for
the cost-effectiveness aspect, DG-III (Industry) of the European Commission
appointed Touche Ross which used the independent consultant Arthur D. Little
Ltd. (ADL) to identify the implications in terms of the capital cost, the
fixed operating cost, the energy cost and the total cost effect expressed
in terms of Net Present Value.<BR>
<BR>
The process started in April 1995 with delegates from EUROPIA (oil industry),
ACEA (auto industry) and DG-XI sitting together to agree on a basis for
the average qualities for gasoline and diesel fuel for year 2000. This was
done taking into account the direct and indirect effects of existing EU
legislation and oil industry initiatives which, by the year 2000, will improve
the emissions potential of road fuels. Particularly noteworthy amongst these
changes are: for gasoline, average benzene content is coming down from 2.8
per cent v/v to 2.3 per cent and sulphur content down from 450 ppm (m/m)
to 300 ppm; whilst for diesel fuel, sulphur content is coming down from
about 2000 ppm (m/m) to 450 ppm. <BR>

<TABLE border=0 width=80%><TR><TD align=left> The delegates' next step was
to agree a matrix of 4 gasoline and 4 diesel fuel packages representing
progressively more restrictive universal (EU-wide) reformulations and a
city diesel case (Case V) for up to 25 per cent of diesel demand. NOx had
already been established as the air quality aspect of first concern from
the technical viewpoint, i.e. air quality did not meet the required air
quality standards (AQS) by the year 2010. Thus, NOx emission was a prime
factor in picking the fuel packages, with hydrocarbon (and benzene) and
particulate emissions also targeted for gasoline and diesel, respectively.
The fuels packages qualities and emissions effects (Tables 1 and 2) and
the corresponding array of costs as published by ADL (Table 3) are shown
in terms of the NPV in millions of ECU (multiply by 1.3 to give US$ millions).<BR>

There are many possible pitfalls when developing costs for a non-homogeneous
set of refineries such as exist within the EU oil refining sector, particularly
in the face of an anticipated very tight study budget and time pressures.
Not the least of the problems comes with the cost bases and units used:
care has to be taken about whether Net Present Values (NPVs) or Capital
Expenditures are being shown, in ECUs or $s, in millions or billions (i.e.
giga-). Tables 3 and 4 have been left in the format of their original publication
to illustrate this point.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE had decided a year earlier to set up its own task force (AE/STF-9)
for an in-depth investigation of costs, and to prepare for a validity check
on the eventual analyses. This group set up hypothetical cases with extreme
universal quality/compositions and evaluated the costs for these severely
reformulated gasoline and diesel fuels singly and together. As it transpired,
STF-9's 'severe' gasoline case was similar to ADL's Gasoline Package IV;
the 55 cetane diesel to Diesel Package III and the 58 cetane diesel to Diesel
Package IV.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE's study has been reported in CONCAWE Report No. 95/54. In summary,
the published capital costs found are shown in Table 4 in giga US$. Dividing
these figures by 1.3 (to give ECU) and multiplying by about 1.8 (to give
NPV for Package IV/IV, for example) demonstrates the reasonably close agreement
with the corresponding ADL package costs.<BR>

Attention is drawn to the magnitude of the costs of such extreme fuels changes
in the light of the small emissions effects. It is unsurprising to CONCAWE
that these were found by Auto/Oil to be clearly out of the running.<BR>
