UNITED KINGDOM RENTAL INCOME OF NON-RESIDENTS

Regulations have been published setting out the details of the new
mechanisms for taxing rental income from UK property in the hands of
non-residents. The rules introduced in the 1995 Finance Act are
designed to bring the taxation of income in such circumstances within
the scope of the new self assessment system. They apply to rent and
other income paid from April 6, 1996.

Under the existing rules tenants, broadly, are obliged to withhold tax
at the rate of 25 per cent on gross rental income paid to non-resident
landlords. Informal arrangements were possible to pay on a net basis
where a UK agent was employed and an annual tax return was filed on
behalf of the non-resident landlord.

The new regulations set out in detail the obligations of non-resident
landlords, their agents and tenants.

Non-residents

The scheme applies to landlords whose "usual place of abode is outside
the UK". This unfortunate expression has been continued in the new
legislation and its precise meaning is unclear. Although in some
respects this corresponds broadly with residence for tax purposes, it
is not identical. A booklet issued by the Inland Revenue interprets the
expression as follows: It considers individuals who usually live
outside the UK as being covered by the scheme. This does not include
someone who is temporarily living outside the UK for six months or
less.

This does not include someone who is temporarily???? In relation to
companies, it covers those that have their main office or other place
of business outside the UK.

It notes that companies incorporated outside the UK will normally have
a usual place of abode outside the UK. Companies which are treated as
resident in the UK for tax purposes will not be regarded as having a
usual place of abode outside the UK. It also notes that the scheme does
not apply to the rental income of UK branches of non-resident
companies.

Trustees are regarded as having a usual place of abode outside the UK
if all the trustees have a usual place of abode outside the UK.

The Inland Revenue booklet notes that normally where a person is
treated as non-UK resident for tax purposes they will have a usual
place of abode outside the UK. It is clear however that the two
concepts are not viewed by the Inland Revenue as being identical.

Tax Base

The regulations require prescribed persons to deduct tax at the basic
rate from UK rental income, pay the tax quarterly to the Inland Revenue
and submit annual information returns setting out income expenses and
tax deducted. The basic rate from April 6, 1996 is 24 per cent.

Letting agents

Primary liability rests with letting agents. These are defined in the
legislation as persons who act on behalf of the non-resident in
connection with the management or administration of its UK property
rental business.

A statement by the Inland Revenue in a recent tax bulletin indicates
that they view this as a wide definition which includes those who act
in an informal manner such as friends or relatives as well as
professionals such as estate agents who collect rent. It does not cover
banks who merely provide accounts into which the income is paid.

In addition it applies to agents only if they handle or control UK
rental income on behalf of the non-resident. Therefore, accountants who
do no more than prepare accounts and tax returns or agents who merely
find tenants in return for fees without collecting any rent are not
included.

Persons who provide legal services are specifically excluded. This
covers solicitors recovering arrears of rent or receiving apportioned
rents in the course of a sale of property. If, however, solicitors
collect the first payment of rent after drawing up the lease they will
be covered because that is viewed as going beyond the provision of
legal advice or services.

Tenants

Where there is no letting agent the tenant must operate the scheme in
most cases. Tenants who pay rent of #100 per week or less are excluded
unless served with a notice from the Inland Revenue to operate the
scheme.

In either case the withholding person is required to register with the
Inland Revenue. Tax is paid to the Inland Revenue quarterly.

In the case of letting agents tax is deducted against:

- all Schedule A income, plus

- other Schedule A income paid away by the tenant in the quarter at the
letting agents direction, less

- expenses paid in the quarter which the agent can reasonably be
satisfied are allowable expenses of the non-resident landlord.

If expenses in the quarter exceed income received then the agent may
carry back surplus expenses to earlier quarters in the same year ended
at March 31 taking later quarters before earlier ones. Any surplus
expenses not used in this manner may be carried forward to future
quarters including those in a later year.

In the case of tenants, tax is calculated on:

- Schedule A income paid in the quarter to the non-resident landlord,
plus

- Schedule A income paid to a third party not being a payment they can
reasonably be satisfied is an allowable expense of the landlord.

Tenants must show the tax due on a quarterly return submitted with
payment within 30 days of the end of the quarter. In the case of
letting agents they will both return and pay in respect of all non-
resident landlords they represent. As tenants calculate tax on amounts
paid there is no carry back of surplus expenses.

Schedule A Business

Income from property underwent a significant reform in the 1995 Finance
Act (see FTWTR December 1994 page 228). Schedule A business essentially
comprises all property rental and the scheme covers income received by
or within the control of a letting agent or where there is no letting
agent, amounts paid by a tenant. It includes all annual profits or
gains arising from any land in the UK including income from the letting
or licensing of any furnished or unfurnished property and any premiums
chargeable as income rent charges ground rents etc.

Deductible expenses

The test for deductibility is now similar to that in relation to
trading activities. Expenses are those which the agent or tenant can be
reasonably satisfied are allowable in computing the profits of the non-
residents Schedule A business paid by the agent or the tenant. The
Inland Revenue proposes to publish guidance notes on this subject. If
the guidance notes are followed there will be no penalty for deducting
expenses which ultimately turn out not to be deductible.

They have warned where agents are unable to satisfy themselves whether
an expense is deductible, for example where there is insufficient
information about the purpose of the expenditure, they should not
deduct it.

Payment without deduction of tax

The regulations make provision for non-residents to receive rental
income without deduction of tax. Application may be made which when
approved will permit agents or tenants to pay without deduction of tax.
This may be allowed where the non-residents' UK tax affairs are up to
date or where they have never had any UK tax obligations or where they
do not expect to be liable to UK income tax (for example where expenses
will likely exceed income).

In each case they must undertake to comply with all their UK
obligations including filing of all returns and paying tax due on time.

The Inland Revenue will give reasons for any refusal and an appeal may
be made against such a refusal. Agents and tenants will be notified of
the obligation to resume withholding if the approval is withdrawn.

TRANSFER PRICING - UNITED STATES COST SHARING REGULATIONS

Code S482 was amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to require that
consideration for the use of intangible property transferred in a
controlled transaction must be commensurate with the income generated
by the item of intangible property. Congress did not intend to preclude
multinational groups from entering into bona fide research and
development cost sharing arrangements as an appropriate method of
allocating income attributable to intangibles among related parties.

The IRS issued a study of intercompany pricing in 1988 known as "the
White Paper". The White Paper suggested that most bona fide cost
sharing arrangements should have certain provisions.

For example, cost sharing arrangements should cover all research within
a particular three-digit SIC code, most participants should be assigned
exclusive geographic rights in developed intangibles (and should be
able to predict benefits and divide costs accordingly), and marketing
intangibles should be excluded from bona fide cost sharing
arrangements.

The IRS issued proposed cost sharing regulations in 1992.

The final regulations issued in December 1995 define a cost sharing
arrangement as an agreement for sharing costs in proportion to
reasonably anticipated benefits from the individual exploitation of
interests in the intangibles that are developed. Although a taxpayer
must satisfy certain formal requirements to contend that a cost sharing
arrangement exists, the IRS may apply the cost sharing rules to any
arrangement that in substance constitutes a cost sharing arrangement.
For a US-based company, this could result in a loss of R&D deductions.

The final regulations provide that neither a qualified cost sharing
arrangement nor an arrangement treated in substance as such, will be
treated as a partnership. Moreover, a foreign participant will not be
treated as being engaged in a trade or business within the US solely by
virtue of its participation in such an arrangement.

The final regulations emphasize the move away from a strict use of
numeric ratios in measuring the sharing of costs with the anticipated
benefits. Thus, for example, no allocation will be made with respect to
a qualified cost sharing arrangement, except to make each controlled
participant's share of the intangible development costs equal to its
share of reasonably anticipated benefits.

Similarly, in listing the requirements for qualification, the final
regulations provide that the arrangement must provide a method to
calculate each controlled participant's share of intangible development
costs based on factors that can reasonably be expected to reflect
anticipated benefits. The new standard is intended to ensure that cost
sharing arrangements will not be disregarded by the IRS as long as the
factors upon which an estimate of benefits was based were reasonable,
even if the estimate proves inaccurate.

As under the proposed regulations, a cost sharing arrangement must be
set forth in writing and contain a number of specified provisions,
including the interest that each controlled participant will have
received in any intangibles developed, referred to as "covered
intangibles". If the research results in the development of intangible
property that was not foreseen at the inception of the cost sharing
arrangement, the property is also included as a covered intangible.

The final regulations permit participation by unrelated persons,
referred to as "uncontrolled participants", in a cost sharing
agreement. Controlled taxpayers may be participants, referred to as
"controlled participants", provided that they use or reasonably expect
to use covered intangibles in the active conduct of a trade or
business. An entity that chiefly provides services as a contract
researcher may not be a controlled participant. However, nothing
prevents a service entity such as a contract researcher from furnishing
research and development services to the members of a qualified cost
sharing arrangement in return for appropriate consideration.

As under the proposed regulations, the activity of another person may
be attributed to a controlled taxpayer for purposes of meeting the
active conduct requirement. However, the standard has changed. In the
proposed regulations, the controlled taxpayer merely had to bear the
risk and receive the benefits of the attributed activity. Under the
final regulations the attribution will be made only where the
controlled taxpayer exercises substantial managerial and operational
control over the attributed activities. Thus, a shell entity is
unlikely to qualify for participation.

The final regulations define intangible development costs as operating
expenses other than depreciation and amortization expense, and an arm's
length charge for tangible property made available to cost sharing
arrangements. As under the proposed regulations, the IRS may adjust the
pool of costs shared in order to properly reflect costs that relate to
the intangible development area.

The final regulations define anticipated benefits as additional income
generated or costs saved by the use of covered intangibles. The pool of
benefits may also be adjusted in order to properly reflect benefits
that relate to the intangible development area. Anticipated benefits of
uncontrolled participants will be excluded.

A share of reasonably anticipated benefits will be determined using the
most reliable estimate of benefits. This rule echoes the best method
rule for determining the most reliable measure of an arm's length
result under the substantive transfer pricing regulations. The
reliability of an estimate of benefits principally depends on two
factors; the reliability of the basis for measuring benefits used and
the reliability of the projections used.

The cost to operating income ratio used in the proposed regulations to
check the reasonableness of an effort to share costs in proportion to
anticipated benefits is deleted from the final regulations. Instead, an
allocation of costs or income may be made if the taxpayer did not use
the most reliable estimate of benefits. That determination will depend
on the facts and circumstances of each case. The most reliable basis
for measuring anticipated benefits must be used and the measurement
basis must be consistent for all controlled participants. The
regulations provide that benefits may be measured directly or
indirectly.

In addition, regardless of whether a direct or indirect basis of
measurement is employed, it may be necessary to make adjustments to
account for material differences in the activities that controlled
participants perform in connection with exploitation of covered
intangibles, such as between wholesale and retain distribution.
Indirect bases for measuring benefits may include units of production,
sales, operating profit and any other factor that bears a relationship
to benefits.

The final regulations provide that projections used to estimate
benefits must include a projection of the time over which benefits will
be received and a projection of the benefits anticipated for each year
in the period. A significant divergence between projected and actual
benefit shares may indicate that the projections were not reliable. A
significant divergence is defined as divergence in excess of 20 per
cent between projected and actual benefit shares.

If there is a significant divergence, which is not due to an
unforeseeable event, the IRS may use actual benefits as the most
reliable basis for measuring benefits. Conversely, no allocation will
be made based on a divergence that is not considered significant as
long as the estimate is made using the most reliable basis for
measuring benefits. For purposes of the 20 per cent test, all non US
controlled participants are treated as a single controlled participant
in order that a divergence by a foreign controlled participant with a
very small share of the total costs will not necessarily trigger an
allocation.

A taxpayer receiving a cost sharing payment must reduce its research
and development expense. The final regulations adopt a net approach to
foster simplicity and preserve the character of items actually incurred
by a participant to the extent not reimbursed.

Any payment that in substance constitutes a cost sharing payment will
be treated as such, regardless of its characterization under foreign
law. This rule is intended to enable foreign entities to participate in
cost sharing arrangements with US controlled participants even if
foreign law does not recognise cost sharing.

KATZ COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM

The Katz Commission of Inquiry into tax reform (see FTWTR January 1995
p3) released their Third Interim Report in December 1995.

The thrust of the First Interim Report was that the Revenue
administration had to be restructured to ensure effective revenue
collection and to make meaningful tax reform possible.

In an announcement at the end of 1995, the Government accepted most of
the Commission's recommendations on administrative reform. These
include the establishment of a combined Inland Revenue and Customs
authority with a greater degree of independence than before. The
effectiveness of collection is expected to improve almost immediately.
The longer term benefit will only be realised over several years.
Several recommendations are not final in this report, although
important indications of future developments are recorded.

Retirement Savings

The most comprehensive recommendation in the Third Interim Report is
for retirement funds to be brought into the tax net. This deviates from
the decades long South African formula of deductible contributions to
pension funds, exempt build-up in the funds, and taxability on payout.
The Commission recommended a 30 per cent flat rate tax on normal
taxable income in the funds. The recommendations are motivated by two
considerations. First, assets of some R500 billion, an appreciable part
of the economy, are controlled through these funds; over the years this
has brought about a massive, structural inducement to arbitrage between
the taxable and exempt sectors of the economy. Second, the retirement
industry has enjoyed a degree of fiscal privilege which is viewed as
incompatible with other priorities in a democratic society.

The current tax exemption for payments from public sector funds should
disappear. Differences in tax treatment between pension, provident, and
benefit funds are to be removed, especially those concerning
deductibility of contributions. Limitations on deductibility are to be
eased. Lump-sum payouts are to be taxed at progressive rates with
reference to a capital sum; thereafter pensions, whether in lump sum or
through annuity, will be untaxed. Transitional measures are proposed to
ensure that no vested rights are affected. The Commission has expressed
the view that at least some of the additional tax collected should be
applied towards relief in the income tax area.

Business Tax Issues

Corporate profits - The report expresses a preference over the longer
term for an imputation type system, but finds that current
administrative capacity and the likely lesser sophistication of an
emerging corporate sector militate against real progress at this time.
The current system of a Secondary Tax on Companies (STC) should
therefore be retained; however, the STC rate of 25 per cent on
distributed profits has a distortionary effect and should be reduced to
something like 15 per cent.

Several more detailed measures are proposed to streamline the STC. None
affect the basic principle that STC is an additional tax on companies
upon distribution and dividends are untaxed in the hands of recipients.

The Commission noted the acceptance by the UK authorities of the STC as
a creditable tax for treaty purposes and an apparent acceptance by the
Japanese authorities that the tax will qualify for foreign tax credit
purposes.

The Commission took cognisance of the fact that the STC is not
currently enforced against foreign businesses operating in South Africa
in the form of a branch. After rejecting a branch profits tax the
Commission recommended that this tax be abolished for branches rather
than to be retained and not enforced.

Group Taxation - South Africa currently has no general group tax
system. Each corporate entity is regarded as a separate taxpayer. The
Commission strongly criticised this and recommends introduction of an
elective group basis of taxation. In view of expected administrative
deficiencies, it proposes a gradual introduction.

Initially a group will be defined as involving only 100 per cent
affiliations (employee shares excepted). Losses carried forward into
the new system will not be allowed against group profits. Initially
only current year losses will be dealt with on a group basis. The
intention is to extend the degree of full consolidation group
treatment.

Share Incentives - The Commission did not favour sweeping incentives to
encourage employee share ownership. It did recommend a system of
deferral on the fringe benefit tax consequences of employer assisted
finance for the acquisition of employer shares. It also recommended
that, proper dealers apart, it should be made clear that employees will
not be taxed on gains on employer shares.

Anti Avoidance - The current general anti-avoidance provision in the
Income Tax Act (Section 103) provides the taxpayer with two main
defences - namely that the transactions in question did not have a tax
advantage as sole or main objective and that they did not create rights
and obligations abnormal within the relevant circumstances. The latter
test has been increasingly interpreted by the courts as subjective, to
a point where it became very difficult to attack certain avoidance
schemes. The Commission proposed that the abnormality test should be
scrapped in favour of a bona fide business purpose test.

This will apply in all business situations. Private family transactions
will continue to be governed by a normality requirement. The Commission
suggested that the provisions should not apply where it could be shown
that the transaction would not result in misuse of the Income Tax Act.

Other Levies - The Commission strongly criticised the current Regional
Services Council Levies (low-rate levies on payroll and turnover), but
stopped short of recommending their abolition, mainly because their
fate could best be decided by the Financial and Fiscal Commission - a
body charged with adjudicating funding as between the various
provinces.

It favoured abolishing the financial services levy on financial
institutions in favour of including all fee based financial services
under the VAT net.

It recommended abolition of the marketable securities tax on share
transfers on the stock exchange, and similar stamp duties on other
transactions.

Other Matters

Capital Gains Tax - The Commission recommended against a capital gains
tax at this time. The benefits would not justify the cost, effort and
complexity; such a tax is not a priority. The Commission did recommend
that, should a capital gains tax ever be considered, assets would have
to be assigned a benchmark date value which would then not be subject
to the tax.

Instead, the Commission recommended continuation of the donations tax
and estate duty, although they could be merged into a new capital
transfer tax.

Land Tax - Study into the feasibility of a land tax continues. Insofar
as South Africa already taxes municipal property on a local government
level, such a tax will mainly affect rural land. The Commission has
already indicated that a land tax on the national level would be very
unlikely, but scope remains for such a tax on a local or regional
level. Further recommendations will be made in due course.

Taxpayer rights - The Commission proposed that the administration
articulate certain basic rights for taxpayers. In its First Interim
Report it has listed a number of provisions in the current law which
would probably fall foul of the Interim Constitution regarding basic
rights and administrative fairness.

In this report they proposed a Statement of Taxpayer Rights. This
statement will not constitute a legal Bill of Rights.

Implementing these principles will be a function of specific
legislation, Codes of Practice, intervention by the existing Public
Protector and a tax specific ombudsman.

EUROPEAN UNION: TRANSIT CHARGE UNDER PRIVATE CONTRACT

The European Court of Justice has ruled on the question as to whether a
transit charge payable under a private contract has equivalent effect
to a customs duty and is therefore illegal under European law in Eduard
de Bois et Fils SA and General Cargo Services v Garanor Exploitation
SA.

Garanor managed an international road station and brought proceedings
against two customers for non-payment of a contractually agreed charge
known as a "taxe de passage" (transit charge). The appellants were
forwarding agents and recognised as such by the customs authority. In
addition to paying rent to the respondent for premises at an
international road station where customs clearance operations are
normally completed, they paid a flat rate transit charge for each
vehicle in international transit calculated on the basis of monthly
returns by the appellants.

The charge was intended to cover expenses of the respondent in respect
of the performance by the customs and veterinary services of their
tasks as providers of services in the public interest.

The Court ruled that the charge is illegal under European law if it is
designed to compensate a private undertaking for bearing costs arising
from the performance of services in the public interest even if they
have not been imposed by the state but arise from an agreement
concluded by that undertaking with its customers.

EUROPEAN UNION: VAT ON RESEARCH PROGRAMMES

In response to a Parliamentary question, Commissioner Monti has
confirmed that under the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of
the European Community as reflected in Article 15(10) of the Sixth VAT
Directive, goods and services supplied to the Commission are exempt
from VAT, either directly or by means of a subsequent refund of tax.

He said that the Commission is anxious to ensure that organisations
which participate in Community funded research and technological
development programmes receive equal treatment under the common VAT
system. It will therefore monitor the situation carefully taking
appropriate measures as necessary.

The question raised concern that if individual universities and
research organisations have to reclaim VAT from the British Government,
they will find it almost impossible to do so if the Commission does not
intend to change the policy of globally claiming VAT on research
programmes from member state governments.

EUROPEAN UNION: DELAY IN DEFINITIVE VAT REGIME LIKELY

In response to a question in the European parliament the taxation
commissioner Mr Mario Monti has refused to give an assurance that the
definitive system for VAT will enter into force on January 1, 1997 as
stated in article 28 of the sixth VAT directive.

The directive was amended in 1991 to introduce a transitional
arrangement for a period of four years which is to expire on December
31, 1996. A final or definitive system was to enter into force
thereafter which was proposed to embrace the original system. This
envisages tax imposed in the country of origin of goods or services
only with input tax being claimed by business customers in the country
of destination based on the tax charged in the country of origin.

The transitional arrangements are however automatically extended until
the definitive system enters into effect.

Reasons given by the commission for the delay are the amount of work
done and the recent enlargement of the EU. They view it as unlikely
that the deadline will be met.

BELGIUM: WEALTH TAX HINT

Mr Elio di Rupo, the deputy prime minister of Belgium, has raised the
possibility of introducing a wealth tax and a "generalised social
levy", as a way of taking some of the pain out of spending cuts in this
year's budget.

Belgium already has high tax rates, but the government needs to raise
revenues to plug the budget deficit.

Mr di Rupo said: "The problem of social security will not be solved
only acting on the spending side and asking exclusively for an effort
from those who benefit from various social benefits".

FRANCE: FINANCE AMENDMENT LAW 1996

The Finance Amendment Law finally adopted by Parliament on December 21,
1995 has been submitted to the Constitutional Council ("Conseil
Constitutionnel"). Its entry into force depends on publication in the
"Journal Officiel" and the approval of the Constitutional Council.

Simplified Declaration System

Small or medium companies may be taxed under a special regime called
the simplified declaration tax system. Such companies may keep
simplified accounts and report their income on a simplified return. The
scope of application of this system has changed.

Previously, companies with annual turnover not exceeding Fr 3,800,000
for sales and lodging or Fr 1,100,000 for services, qualified for the
simplified system.

Under the new law, the thresholds are increased to Fr 5,000,000 for
sales and lodging and Fr 1,500,000 for services. The simplified regime
will now concern 60,000 to 70,000 companies representing 8 per cent of
those taxed under the normal regime.

The thresholds first apply to 1995 personal income tax, to corporate
income tax for tax years closed at December 31, 1995 and from January
1, 1996 for VAT.

VAT

The new law mainly enacts the second VAT Simplification Directive
95/7/EEC of April 10, 1995.

The transposition concerns operations of jobbing, ("travail a facon")
which are now treated as services; the territoriality of work and
expert evaluation on personal tangible property and transportation of
approach; the basis of taxation on import; suspensive customs regimes
and export procedure by sales notes.

Other VAT provisions which do not derive from the second simplification
Directive include a new simplified form of tax representation for
certain operations where no VAT is due in France.

Property

According to article 1115 of the French Tax Code (CGI), the purchase of
property by professional real property dealers is subject to
registration duty reduced from 18.6 per cent to 0.6 per cent if the
dealer undertakes to sell the property within four years from the date
of acquisition.

Because of the crisis in the property market, the 1992 finance
amendment bill extended the deadline for sale to December 31, 1996 for
property acquired before January 1, 1993.

The new law extends this for a further two years to December 31, 1998.
It also introduces a reduced tax rate for sales made between January 1,
1999 and December 31, 2001 as follows:

- sales in 1999 - 75 per cent
- sales in 2000 - 50 per cent
- sales in 2001 - 25 per cent

The tax is due in the month following the sale.

Sales benefitting from reduced tax are not subject to the 6 per cent
additional duty. This is normally due by dealers who do not comply with
their undertaking to sell within 4 years.

Interest on late payment at 0.75 per cent per month, remains. It
applies from expiry of the period during which the sale should have
been made.

Contribution of property realised from January 1, 1996 is not to be
considered as a sale for the application of article 1115 of the CGI.

Professional Income

Under article 93 of the CGI, the taxation of professional income is in
principle determined on a cash basis. Professional income comprises non
commercial income of professionals such as doctors or lawyers.

However, the tax administration accepts the accrual basis at the
taxpayers' request.

The accrual system option is now provided by law and must be exercised
before February 1 of a given year.

FRANCE: TAX LAUNCH DELAYED

The French government, under pressure from leaders of its own centre-
right majority, postponed for a month the launch of a new tax designed
to wipe out welfare deficits. "The contribution for the reimbursement
of the social deficit will apply from February 1, 1996" instead of
January 1, the Labour Ministry said.

A former budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a member of the ruling
RPR party, and a centrist former defence minister, Mr Francois Leotard,
had urged the government to delay the new 0.5 per cent income tax for a
year, saying the economy was too fragile to sustain it.

GERMANY: TREATY OVERRIDE

German bilateral tax treaties which eliminate German taxation on
foreign enterprises have allowed activities in Germany both without tax
and the bother of tax formalities. In the last few years domestic law
amendments have changed the whole situation.

Section 50d of the income tax act (Einkommensteurergesetz, Estg) has
been amended three times in the last three years. It now requires
payments subject to German withholding tax to be made without regard to
any tax treaty or the provisions implementing the EU parent-subsidiary
directive. The foreign creditor may only claim a refund of tax withheld
if he can prove that he is entitled to the treaty or EU benefit. Under
certain circumstances the debtor may apply to the competent authority
(the Bundesame fur Finanzen) for approval not to withhold tax.

If the foreign creditor is a company, the tax authorities may deny it
the exemption if the shareholders personally would not be entitled to
the tax exemption and if there are no economically convincing reasons
for using the company and the company has no commercial activities of
its own.

The importance of these provisions has grown because obligations to
withhold have been broadened. Previously, only licence fees, dividends
and similar profits were subject to withholding. Now the proceeds from
the sales of enterprises, real property and patents are subject to
withholding. The tax authorities require withholding on gross payments
rather than net profits.

These rules and the approach of the tax authorities have been widely
regarded as not conforming to treaty obligations and EU law. In
particular, treaty exemption of profits from commercial activities and
the parent/subsidiary directive's abolition of withholding taxes seem
contrary to the provisions.

The tax authorities emphasise that the rules and their application are
only onerous for German debtors and therefore do not discriminate
against foreign enterprises.

A number of cases have now focused on the issues. The first important
decision of the Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) was published in
1995. In a further decision in 1995 the Federal Tax Court has confirmed
and made clear its position.

The Federal tax court did not discuss the conflict with treaties but
pointed out that treaties are implemented by national legislation.
National legislation may be amended and overturned by further
legislation. This is what happened in the case of section 50d Estg
according to the Federal Tax Court. The consequences for contracting
states may be discussed between the governments but are not to be
regarded by the court according to German doctrine on public
international law.

In German tax law the practical approach has been different. It is
assumed that domestic tax law is not intended to infringe international
law. Domestic law and treaties are therefore to be interpreted so that
treaties could prevail over national law or that domestic law not be
read as contradicting a treaty. This is supported by section 2 of the
Act on Tax Procedure (Abgabenordunung), which gives a provision derived
from a tax treaty precedence before a provision of purely national law.

The latest court decision overturns the traditional method of
interpretation and will encourage the treaty overriding legislation
which Germany has recently begun to enact.

The decision only deals with a question under a bilateral treaty.
Conformity with EU law still has to be discussed.

GERMANY: JOBS THROUGH TAX BREAKS

Germany plans to encourage new business creation and give tax
concessions to small and medium sized enterprises as part of a
programme to boost employment, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance
minister, said on December 10, 1995.

"We are doing everything to encourage business start-ups and we want a
sensible company tax reform," he said in an interview with the
Financial Times.

As part of a "symmetrical finance policy" that reduces the government
deficit and taxes in parallel, Mr Waigel said he wanted to get rid of
Germany's wealth tax and the local trading capital tax, a levy that
taxes companies even when they do not make a profit.

He also wanted to blunt the impact of local profit taxes on small and
medium sized companies by lowering initial tax rates and giving
concessions to companies building up financial reserves.

"The government does its duty if it consolidates the budget and tries
to cut those taxes and levies within its power," he said. He denied
rumours that he was seeking to increase value added tax: "I do not have
such plans."

ITALY: 1996 BUDGET - FINAL STEP

The new tax measures connected with the 1996 Budget have definitively
entered into force following their approval by Parliament and
publication in the Official Gazette.

Mortgage and cadastral tax rates are increased to 2 per cent and tax
benefits for the purchase of first houses extended.

The deadline for companies' net worth tax has been extended to the
financial year closing on September 30, 1997.

Tax benefits for companies in connection with new capital investments
have been extended to the end of 1996 in respect of undertakings
located in the depressed areas of Southern Italy, or having less than
20 employees and a turnover not exceeding 5 billion Lire. For all other
Italian companies such tax benefits have been extended only until April
1996.

Tax credits in respect of Personal Income Tax (IRPEF), Company Income
Tax (IRPEG) and Local Income Tax (ILOR) may now be assigned.

New anti-avoidance provisions and measures regarding bank secrecy have
been introduced.

Tax on driving licenses has been increased to Lire 70,000, on gun
licences to Lire 170,000 and tax for enrolment in special lists to Lire
250,000.

Interest is only deductible subject to more severe limits than before,
(for details see FTWTR November page 206 and December 1995 page 228).

ITALY: NEW YEAR'S EVE DECREE

A Law Decree (which must be converted into Law by Parliament within
sixty days of its entry into force) was enacted by the government on
January 30, 1995. Tax measures in the decree complete those provided in
the 1996 Budget and are expected to ensure an increase in the State's
revenue of Lire 5,285 billion, of which Lire 3,800 billion will be
obtained by introducing new taxes and by extending the deadline of the
mass tax settlement while Lire 1,485 billion by reducing public
spending.

The mass tax settlement, which was previously applicable only with
regard to returns filed in respect of the tax years 1987 to 1993 (see
FTWTR August 1995 page 146; October 1995 p. 185) has now been extended
(with new conditions) also to years 1994 and 1995.

The cigarette price is increased by Lire 200. Excise duty rates on
spirits are increased by approximately 8 per cent. Excise duty
regarding "unleaded" petrol is increased by Lire 22.

Stamp-duties are increased from Lire 15,000 to 20,000 while stamp
duties at a fixed rate on invoices, receipts, documents etc. are
increased from Lire 2,000 to Lire 2,500.

Highway tolls are increased on average by 2.6 per cent.

NETHERLANDS: INTEREST DEDUCTION FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION

The Undersecretary of Finance has published the policy on the
deductibility of costs incurred with respect to a minority
participation qualifying for the participation exemption.

The participation exemption excludes from corporate income tax both
dividends and capital gains in respect of a qualifying participation
(article 13 of the 1969 Corporate Income Tax Act).

The shareholder will often incur costs with respect to the management
and financing of that participation. According to article 13, paragraph
1, these costs are not deductible, unless the owner can demonstrate
that they contribute to profits which are taxable in the Netherlands.

This rule may prove to be a serious problem for a Netherlands company
which acquires a minority participation in a concern which is active
both in the Netherlands and in other countries. The company may have
difficulties acquiring the information required to demonstrate that the
costs it incurred with respect to said participation contribute to
profits taxable in the Netherlands.

To accommodate companies which find themselves in this situation, the
Undersecretary of Finance recently stated that these costs are
considered to be incurred with respect to profits taxable in the
Netherlands if the minority participation has a "sufficient"
substantial relation with the Netherlands. This may be the case if the
Netherlands' business activities of the company in which the
participation is held are "material" in relation to the total business
activities of the concern of which that company is a part.

According to the Undersecretary, costs incurred with respect to a
minority participation will be deductible if:

- the company in which a minority participation is acquired is a
resident of the Netherlands and conducts business activities in the
Netherlands. This includes Netherlands resident subsidiaries, in which
that company has an interest of at least 25 per cent;

- the business activities conducted in the Netherlands are material in
relation to the whole of business activities conducted by the concern
of which the Netherlands companies are a part;

- the acquiring company, together with related companies, does not own
a controlling interest (25 per cent or more) in the participation.

The meaning of "material" is undefined since, depending on the specific
circumstances of a case, different factors may be decisive with regard
to the question whether the business activities have a sufficient
relation with the Netherlands. However, the Undersecretary did indicate
that, although no fixed percentage can be assumed, 5 or 10 per cent may
be considered material.

Given the important role of the participation exemption the letter has
important practical implications. Unfortunately, since the "material"
criterion is not explained in detail, it is not quite certain what the
exact range of approval is.

NETHERLANDS: CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE

Until January 1, 1996, Netherlands corporate income tax was levied at
40 per cent on profits up to Dfl 100,000, and 35 per cent on the
excess. The 40 per cent rate will be gradually reduced. In 1996, it
will be 37 per cent, in 1997, 36 per cent and in 1998, it will be 35
per cent.

Thus from 1998, corporate income tax will be levied at 35 per cent
rate.

UNITED KINGDOM: PENSION SCHEMES - INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS

The Inland Revenue have issued a revised practice note relating to
pension schemes in the international context.

The circumstances in which employees overseas can remain members of a
UK approved pension scheme have been amended. The results are more
favourable and represent several relaxations. In particular,
individuals can remain overseas for periods of up to 10 years or longer
with agreement. They need not be under the control of the UK employer
and may also apply where the initial employment is with the UK branch
of a non-resident employer.

It is also intended that the requirement that the employee must have
initially worked in the UK be relaxed on an experimental basis.

Overseas pension technical changes have been made in relation to the
circumstances in which an employee from overseas can obtain
corresponding relief for UK tax purposes in respect of membership of a
foreign pension scheme.

In particular, the recognition of foreign schemes as corresponding to
UK arrangements for multi-national groups in tax havens are limited to
circumstances where it is legally impossible to establish a scheme for
the foreign emoluments employee in the jurisdiction of location or
where it is a scheme for a multi-national group to which all expatriate
(or at least the career expatriate) employees belong.

Individuals who are granted corresponding relief under the previous
practice will not be subject to the new practice on any future claim to
relief in respect of the same scheme.

UK/Ireland

The statement notes that the reciprocal approval agreement between the
UK and Ireland has been discontinued although relief may be available
pursuant to the protocol to the tax treaty between the two countries.

UNITED KINGDOM: COMPANY RESIDENCE

The Special Commissioners have recently considered the residence of two
offshore companies in the case of Untelrab Limited and Others v
McGregor. The principle that a non-UK incorporated company is resident
where its central management and control is exercised is based on a
handful of decisions the most recent of which is nearly 40 years old
and the majority of which are over 80 years old.

The two companies in question were subsidiaries of a UK resident parent
company. One was formed for the purpose of receiving the purchase price
when the UK parent purchased a company and assumed its debts.

Two of the directors were resident in Bermuda and were executives in a
company which managed the day-to-day affairs of the offshore company. A
third was a Jersey resident solicitor. Board meetings were held two or
three times a year in Bermuda attended by the two Bermuda directors. No
advance notice of board meetings was given and no agenda was circulated
although the Jersey director was kept informed of what was decided.

The company's business was the making of loans to other members of the
parent company's group at the request of the parent company.

The second company remained dormant for some five years and thereafter
participated in the financial dealings of the first. It was managed by
accountants in Guernsey. Two of the directors were residents of Sark
where the board meetings were held.

The Inland Revenue argued that the boards of both subsidiaries merely
rubber stamped decisions which had been made by the parent and had not
addressed their minds as to what they were being asked to do. They did
not really make decisions. While documentation was made in Bermuda the
decisions were taken in London.

They also argued that if, on the facts, a local board submitted to
direction from outside then that was central management and controlled
from outside. It was insufficient to go through the forms of corporate
governing where in fact decisions purportedly taken by a subsidiaries
board were taken at the direction of a parent. They argued that it
could not sensibly be said that the boards were making the decisions
and that in reality they were taken by the parent.

The Commissioners identified the following principles based on existing
cases:

- The Company was resident where the directors met and transacted their
business and exercised the powers conferred upon them;

- If the directors met in two places the Company's business was where
its real business was carried on and the real business was carried on
where the central management and control actually abided;

- A determination as to whether a case fell within that rule was purely
a question of fact to be determined by a scrutiny of the course of
business and trading;

- The actual management and not the place where a company ought to be
managed determined its residence;

- It was an exceptional case for a parent company to exert control for
its subsidiaries as a parent usually operated through the boards of its
subsidiaries;

- Although a board might do what it was told to it did not follow that
the control and management of the company lay with another so long as
the board exercised their discretion when coming to decisions and would
have refused to carry out an improper or unwise transaction; and

- When deciding the issue one should stand back from the detail and
consider the picture which the whole of the evidence presented.

On these principles the Commissioners found that although the
subsidiaries were complacent to do the will of the parent they did
actually function in giving effect to the parents' wishes. Proposals
were discussed at board meetings and decisions were made by the
directors in the best interests of the Company. They would have refused
to carry out any proposal which was improper or unreasonable. The
parent did not control the board in the exercise of their powers. It
could have taken steps to remove the directors but could not control
them in their conduct of the business. The companies were therefore
resident in Bermuda and Sark respectively.

UNITED KINGDOM: WITHHOLDING TAX RATES

The Inland Revenue has issued a press release to clarify the rates of
tax withheld at source following the budget of November 29, 1995. The
basic rate of income tax was reduced from 25 to 24 per cent. Generally,
withholding has been at the basic rate. However certain rates of tax on
passive income have also been reduced to 20 per cent. As a result the
principal withholding tax rates from April 6, 1996 will be as in the
table below.

20% rate

Payment

- Interest paid by banks, building societies and other deposit-takers

- Interest on UK Government and other securities

- Interest distributions by authorised unit trusts

- Other annual interest payable under deduction of tax

- Purchased life annuities (income element)

- Certain payments made by paying and collecting agents

24% rate

- Annual payments (including charges on income, such as payments under
deeds of covenant to charities, and distributions by unauthorised unit
trusts)

- Other annuities (where PAYE does not apply)

- Rents paid to non-resident landlords

- Patent royalties

- Payments to foreign entertainers and sportsmen (subject to any
application for a reduced tax payments)

Income treated as paid under deduction of tax

Certain income is treated as though tax has been deducted from it but
the tax is not repayable. From April 6, 1996 tax will be treated as
deducted or paid at the following rates:

20% rate

- Foreign income dividends

- Stock dividends

- Loans to participators which are waived

24% rate

- Certain chargeable event gains.

UNITED STATES: BUDGET BATTLE CONTINUES

The philosophical differences between the Administration and the
majority Republicans in the House and Senate continue. In December, the
President vetoed the balanced budget bill passed by both Houses of
Congress. The bill contained major tax reform proposals. Subsequently,
the Administration offered its seven year balanced budget proposal,
relying on significant tax increases to offset middle class tax relief.

Included among the revenue raisers are the Administration's
expatriation tax as modified by the Senate (all gains of expatriates
would be taxed upon expatriation, rather than the proposal adopted by
Congress involving a 10 year extension of US tax jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of US assets), and the foreign grantor trust
proposals. Other revenue raisers in the Administration's plan include:

- A reduction in the dividends received deduction available to
corporations, from 70 per cent to 50 per cent thereby increasing tax on
intercompany dividends from a maximum rate of 10.5 per cent to a
maximum rate of 17.5 per cent.

- Treatment of preferred stock as boot in corporate organizations and
reorganizations, forcing recognition of gain on the receipt of
preferred shares as consideration for the transfer of property.
Conditions similar to those that appear in the anti-conduit regulations
would have to be met for the provision to apply. Those conditions
establish a standard under which an equity transaction has
characteristics of debt.

-  The conversion of a C Corporation to S Corporation status would be a
taxable event for any corporation that has a value in excess of US $5
million.

- Limiting replacement personal property received in like kind
exchanged to property located in the US.

-  Limiting the net operating loss carryback period to one year, but
extending the carryover period to 20 years.

- Creating a new class of Subpart F income for notional principal
contracts and including income from the lending of securities as
Subpart F income.

- Treating certain corporate redemptions that would be afforded
favourable dividend treatment in the hands of a corporation under
existing law as capital gain transactions. For a corporation, capital
gains are subject to higher tax rates than intercompany dividends.

- Limiting interest expense deductions for corporations in connection
with the issuance of debt which (i) had a maturity in excess of 40
years or (ii) provides for the payment of interest in the form of
shares of the corporation.

In addition, the Administration proposes to loosen the rules applicable
to captive insurance companies so that premiums paid to captives will
be treated as insurance if more than 50 per cent of the captive's net
premium income relates to the insurance of risks of unrelated persons.
The Administration also proposes to modify the rules applicable to
domestic corporations operating in Puerto Rico and claiming benefits
under Code S936.

UNITED STATES: REGULATIONS FOR PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIPS

Ordinarily, a partnership is not considered to be a separate entity for
purposes of computing taxable income. Rather, under the aggregate
theory of partnerships, a partnership is treated as a flow through to
its partners, who are generally deemed to receive the income and incur
the expenses booked by the partnership. Nonetheless, in some
circumstances, a partnership may be treated by financial markets as the
equivalent of a publicly traded corporation.

In 1987, Code S7704 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted to provide
corporate treatment for publicly traded partnerships. This means that a
separate level of tax is due from the partnership and the partnership
loses its status as a pass-through to its partners. Existing entities
were given a 10 year carryover before the new rules were to become
effective.

Under the statute, a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if
interests in it are traded on an established securities market or are
readily tradeable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent
thereof. Final regulations have been adopted implementing the statute.

Under the final regulations, an established securities market includes
a national securities exchange registered under section 6 of the
Securities Exchange Act 1934 or a national securities exchange which is
regulated under the laws of its place or organization.

Partnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market or the
substantial equivalent. If, under all the facts and circumstances, the
partners are readily able to buy, sell or exchange their partnership
interests in a manner that is comparable economically, to trading on an
established securities market.

The regulations contain a number of safe harbour exceptions. Under the
first safe harbour, certain transactions are expressly disregarded in
determining whether partnership interests are readily tradeable on a
secondary market. These transactions include traders in which carryover
basis exists, either from a transferor of the partnership interest or
resulting from a distribution from a partnership, transfers at death,
transfers among family members, the issuance of partnership interests
in exchange for cash, property or services, distributions from a
qualified retirement plan or by an individual retirement account.

Second, a transfer that is pursuant to a redemption agreement not
otherwise described above will be disregarded in determining whether
partnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market or
the substantial equivalent thereof if certain conditions are in place
to prevent the redemption and a potential issuance of a comparable
interest in a transaction that follows closely in time.

Under the third safe harbour, transfers effected through a qualified
matching service which match lists of intended sellers and potential
purchasers will be disregarded.

Finally, private placements are disregarded. To constitute a private
placement under the final regulations, all partnership interests must
have been issued in a transaction that was not required to be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the partnership must
not have more than 100 partners at any time during the tax year.

The final regulations provide rules of application for the foregoing
provisions. If a transaction does not fall within a specific safe
harbour, the transaction is not presumed to be a trade of a partnership
interest on an exchange or on a secondary market or the equivalent
thereof. Thus, no presumption arises as to the effect of the
transaction. Taxpayers are free to argue that the particular facts and
circumstances relating to a transfer of a partnership interest are not
sufficient to cause the interest from being sold on the substantial
equivalent of a secondary market. If the sum of the partnership capital
or profits interests transferred during the year, exclusive of
transactions covered by any of the safe harbours, does not exceed 2 per
cent of the total interests in partnership capital or profits, the
partnership is not a publicly traded partnership. Finally, if the
general partner and related entities own more than 10 per cent of the
capital or profits interests at any time during the year, all
percentage computations are to be made exclusive of the interests owned
by the general partners and related entities.

UNITED STATES: NEW SOURCE REGULATIONS PROPOSED

The source of income is an important concept under US tax law. For US
entities, the source rules control the computation of the foreign tax
credit limitation. For foreign entities, the source rule frequently is
crucial in determining whether the US has jurisdiction to tax. Code
S863(b) controls the source of income that arises when a company
engages in income producing activities in more than one location.

In December, the IRS proposed revised regulations under Code S863(b).

Under the proposal, taxpayers are to use the apportionment method to
determine the source of the income when inventory is manufactured in
one country and sold in another country. Under this method, 50 per cent
of the income is sourced in the place where the sale occurs and 50 per
cent is sourced in the place where the production assets are located.
The existing regulations are not limited to production assets and the
reference in the proposed regulations reflects a targeted approach to
the types of assets that are taken into account in the computation. A
production asset is any tangible or intangible asset owned by the
taxpayer and directly used to produce the inventory in issue. Excluded
are accounts receivable, marketing intangibles, transportation assets,
warehouses, the inventory itself, raw materials, work in process,
working capital, investment assets, prepaid expenses and stock of a
subsidiary.

If the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership which owns production
assets, a pro rata portion of those assets will be attributed to the
taxpayer from the partnership. If the taxpayer is a member of an
affiliated group within the meaning of Code S1504(a), the production
activity of the members of its group must be taken into account.

Tangible production assets are located where they are found and
intangible production assets are located where the associated tangible
assets are found.

As under the current regulations, an independent factory price may be
used to determine the source of income. It may only be elected if the
taxpayer regularly sells part of its output to wholly independent
distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to reasonably
reflect the income earned from production activity.

Also, a taxpayer may request advance permission to base its allocation
on its books and records. As part of its submission, the taxpayer must
show that the books and records are not affected by tax considerations.

Rules are also provided in the proposed regulations for transportation
income and for mineral extraction activities.

UNITED STATES: FINAL REGULATIONS FOR R & D EXPENSES

The IRS issued final regulations regarding the allocation and
apportionment of research & development ("R&D") expenses to various
classes of income. For US based taxpayers, the regulations will have
primary impact on the computation of the foreign tax credit limitation
and possibly the computation of combined taxable income for taxpayers
who export through foreign sales corporations or domestic international
sales corporations in order to obtain certain tax benefits.

The regulations finalise a proposal that was circulated for comment in
May 1995. The proposal provided relief to taxpayers in three broad
ways. It allowed taxpayers to allocate R&D expenses on the basis of a
three digit SIC code, rather than on the broader two digit code as
provided in existing law. The percentage of R&D expenses that may be
apportioned exclusively to US sources is 50 per cent if the sales
method of allocation is used.

This is an increase from 30 per cent under existing regulations. An
elective apportionment based on gross income is permitted, but once
elected may not be changed without the permission of the LRS.

The final regulations modify the proposed regulations in two broad
ways. First, taxpayers that elect the gross income method of
apportionment may make an exclusive apportionment of 25 per cent of the
R&D to the US. Under the proposed regulations, an exclusive
apportionment was allowed only if taxpayers elected the sales method of
apportionment. The IRS believes that this is an equivalent benefit to
the exclusive apportionment of 50 per cent under the sales method.

Second, the prior written consent of the IRS to change from the gross
income method to another method is no longer required once the taxpayer
has used the gross income method for 5 years.

UNITED STATES: ENTITY CLASSIFICATION

The IRS and Treasury have advised tax practitioners that publication
date for the "check the box" regulatory proposal for classifying
entities will be delayed into 1996. A simplified system of classifying
international entities is apparently controversial within the IRS and
is holding up the project.

Regulation writers apparently view the proposal as unduly taxpayer
favourable and are opposed to granting taxpayers any leeway in
classifying foreign entities. The overall project may be severed into
domestic and international projects to break the log jam. It is also
reported that the status of one person entitles will not be addressed
in the regulatory proposal.

US: STATE TAXATION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS

In an attempt to raise tax revenue from persons other than local
voters, states have been attempting to collect income tax on pensions
payments and deferred compensation paid to persons who worked in the
state but who are no longer resident at the time of receipt.

Legislative language has been approved for a Federal bill that would
protect employees from tax in this situation. It is reported that the
proposal will cover non-qualified deferred compensation plans only when
the plan has a minimum 10 year payout or when the benefits are tied to
a qualified plan.

UNITED STATES: FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the holding of the
US Tax Court that currency gains derived from the depreciation in the
value of foreign currency in which debt is denominated cannot be
deferred under provisions of US law that defer income from the
discharge of indebtedness in certain circumstances. Philip Morris Inc v
US F3d (2d Cit December 8, 1995, Docket No 95-4084), afig 104 TC 61
(1995). An express discharge of indebtedness must be present for the
deferral opportunity to exist. Where a foreign currency denominated
debt is merely satisfied with the agreed upon number of units of
foreign currency, no discharge exists.

HONG KONG: EXPENDITURE ON PRIVATE CARS

A Bill has been published to disallow deductions for all forms of
expenditure on private cars.

All outgoings and expenditure incurred in connection with the
acquisition, financing, leasing, maintenance, operation or use of a
private car (other than that incurred in respect of trading stock) is
to be disallowed as a deduction in the computation of assessable
profits for business profits tax.

All outgoings and expenditure incurred by employees on the acquisition,
financing, leasing, maintenance, operation or use of a private car is
to be disallowed as a deduction in the computation of assessable income
for salaries tax.

Private cars are to be specifically excluded from the definition of
machinery or plant for the purposes of initial and annual depreciation
allowances on capital expenditure.

The purpose of the proposed legislation is to discourage the use of
private cars which are causing serious traffic congestion and
pollution.

INDONESIA: TAX INCENTIVES PARTIALLY RESTORED

Following major amendments to Indonesia's principal tax laws in 1995
(see FTWTR February 1995 page 34 and March page 56) there have been
attempts to further restrict the already limited tax incentives
available in Indonesia. The official view is that the basic framework
of Indonesian tax law is structured to be internationally competitive
and thereby tax inducements should not be necessary to stimulate
particular sectors of the economy.

The top marginal rate of corporate and personal income tax had been
reduced from 35 per cent to 30 per cent. The Minister of Finance has
been granted authority to reduce the top rate to 25 per cent.

Remaining incentives included deferral of value added tax for approved
investment companies including foreign investment companies. Also the
corporate income tax and value added tax arising from contracts
financed by foreign grant or loan aid were borne by the government of
Indonesia under previous regulations. The Directorate General of Taxes
sought to discontinue deferral of value added tax under the provisions
of the amended Value Added Tax law. A Presidential Decree was published
in April whereby foreign aid financed contracts signed on or after
April 1, 1995 would be subject to tax.

Both changes were controversial and generated considerable discussion
and lobbying. Further changes have recently been announced which
partially reinstate the facilities. Deferral of value added tax has
been restored in respect of all investments which have been approved by
the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) but not later than March 31,
1996.

The related investments must be realised by December 31, 1999. This is
only a partial restoration of facilities for deferral of value added
tax but may enable those potential investors, which had made plans
assuming deferral of value added tax, to go ahead. The period of
realisation may, however, not be extended sufficiently for large
projects where delays are not uncommon. The imposition of VAT on new
investments of plant and equipment results in additional cash outflows
of 10 per cent during the investment period of a project. Although such
value added tax may be recovered, extended delays in refunds are not
uncommon.

Tax facilities for foreign aid contractors have been restored following
the publishing of Presidential Decree No 42/1995 dated November 30,
1995. The implementation is back dated to April 1, 1995 and thus
cancels Presidential Decree No 13/1995 which had withdrawn facilities.
The government of Indonesia will thus continue to bear the corporate
income tax and branch profits tax applicable to such contracts.
Facilities also extend to import duties, value added tax and sales tax
on luxury goods. Facilities only extend to the main contractor and not
its employees or subcontractors.

SOUTH KOREA: 1996 AMENDMENTS

Significant tax reforms have come into effect at the beginning of
January 1996.

Corporate Tax Rates
Taxable Income             1995     1996
up to W100 million         18%      16%
over W100 million          30%      28%

Inhabitant tax of 10 per cent (7.5 per cent in 1995) of corporate tax
should be also included. Agricultural and Fishery communities Special
Tax of 2 per cent on taxable income exceeding W500 million is no longer
applicable in 1996.

Tax Credits

Affiliated companies are those with equity ownership of 20 per cent or
more. The underlying tax on dividends from affiliated companies is
credited from fiscal year beginning January 1, 1996 as follows:

Tax                   Dividend amount
amount of       X     ------------------
affiliated            After tax earnings
company               of affiliated
                      company

Entertainment Expenses Limit

The limit has been changed to the total of W24,000,000 plus 1 per cent
of net worth up to W5 million plus a percentage of revenue on a sliding
scale as follows:

Sales                         %
below W10 billion           0.3
over W10 billion            0.2
over W100 billion           0.1

Accumulated Earnings Tax

Retained earnings appropriated as the reserve for development is
excluded from the tax base for accumulated earnings tax. The reserve
for development may be used to reduce deficits or transferred to
capital only.

Taxation on Capital Transactions

Stock dividends received as a result of the transfer of the capital
surplus including asset revaluation surplus to the capital were
previously taxed as deemed dividends.

After the tax revision, the dividends obtained through such transaction
are exempt from income taxes.

Transfer Pricing

As the tax disputes between nations are increasing, and to be in line
with the world trend, and to provide a legal basis for assessing taxes
on the international transactions between related parties, the Ministry
of Finance and Economy legislated the tax regulations on international
transfer pricing effective from January 1, 1996.

Arm's length price and methods to determine arm's length price such as
comparable uncontrolled price method, resale price method, cost plus
method, are described in detail.

Foreign corporations or non residents who have voting rights of 50 per
cent or more, directly or indirectly, and have the authority to make
decisions on the management of one company are classified as overseas
related parties. If the trades with such related parties are not
conducted at arm's length price, the transfer price can be adjusted.

The National Tax Administration can request information on
international transactions, such as basis of calculating transfer
price. Decree article 4.2 required disclosure of method and basis in
the final tax return starting the tax return for 1996. Taxpayers may be
penalised for failure to provide information in the amount of W30
million or less.

Thin Capitalisation

Interest paid on loans from a parent company or guaranteed by a parent
company in excess of 3 times the capital amount is deemed as dividend.
The ratio is 6:1 for financial institutions.

Controlled Foreign Corporations

Distributable earnings of affiliates located in tax havens are deemed
to be distributed to Korean corporate shareholders. An affiliate is one
where the shareholder has 20 per cent or more of the equity. A tax
haven is a jurisdiction with a corporate tax rate below 15 per cent.

A resident who gifts assets located abroad to a non resident is
required to pay gift tax thereon in Korea.

The procedures for mutual agreement to settle tax disputes between tax
authorities have been clearly defined.

AUSTRALIA: INTEREST WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION

The Government has announced that a number of significant changes will
be made to the exemption from withholding tax applicable to some types
of interest paid to foreign lenders. The changes are designed to
enhance Australian borrowers' access to overseas capital markets.
Interest paid to foreign lenders that does not qualify for the
exemption is subject to a 10 per cent interest withholding tax.

The current interest withholding tax exemption has four features:

- interest must be paid by an Australian corporation to foreign
lenders,

- borrowings must be by way of widely held debentures issued by an
Australian borrower,

- the borrowed funds must be used for business purposes, and

- the borrower must obtain an exemption certificate from the
Commissioner of Taxation prior to the payment of interest.

Changes to the exemption will eliminate the need for taxpayers to
obtain an exemption certificate and will modify other requirements of
the present law. Thus, in line with Australia's new self-assessment
system, it will be the responsibility of Australian borrowers to
ascertain whether the interest qualifies for an exemption from the
interest withholding tax.

Importantly, the requirement that borrowed funds must be used in an
Australian business will be removed, so the withholding tax exemption
will be available where borrowed funds are used to finance housing and
consumer loans.

The wide distribution of debentures requirement will be replaced by a
"public offer" test. To satisfy the public offer test, funds must be
raised by the issue of securities to unrelated foreign lenders by a
company resident in Australia. It will no longer be necessary to meet
the stricter "widely-held" test formerly used.

To protect the integrity of the interest withholding tax where no
exemption applies, borrowers who fail to deduct interest withholding
tax from non-exempt interest payments will be denied a deduction for
the interest payments.

The new interest withholding tax exemption rules apply from January 1,
1996.

AUSTRALIA: OFFSHORE BANKING UNITS

The Government is modifying the Offshore Banking Units regime to
provide Australian-based offshore banking units with greater
flexibility. An offshore banking unit is a banking entity located in
Australia that borrows and re-lends funds offshore. Interest payments
by offshore banking units are exempt from interest withholding tax.

To ensure the operations of offshore banking units were completely
insulated from Australian banking businesses, the original offshore
banking units exemption imposed strict quarantine rules on the units,
including prohibitions on Australian investments.

Offshore banking units that undertake fund management activities have
argued that the prohibition prevents them from offering clients
balanced global portfolios, which normally would contain some
Australian assets. The government has responded to the criticism by
announcing that offshore banking units that undertake fund management
activities will be able to invest up to 10 per cent of the value of
total funds under management in Australian assets.

AUSTRALIA: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONCESSION

The government has announced changes to the research and development
(R&D) tax concession, which provides a 150 per cent deduction for
eligible R&D expenditures, to combat 'gravedigging' practices designed
to exploit the concession.

The 'gravedigging' practice involves consultants examining company
records for previous years' expenditures that might qualify for the
special deduction and applying long after the fact for recognition of
expenses as R&D outlays.

Under the new rules, registration for the concession must take place
within six months of the end of the year in which the expenses were
incurred. Transitional arrangements will allow registration of expenses
incurred in the 1993-94 tax year and the 1994-95 tax year (ending 30
June 1995) until 30 June 1996. Expenses incurred prior to 1 July 1993
will no longer be eligible for the concession.

AUSTRALIA: ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION RESTRICTED

The apparent scope of Australia's general anti-avoidance provision has
been substantially narrowed following the decision of the Full Federal
Court in Spotless Services Limited & Anor 95 ATC 4775.

The taxpayer in the Spotless case had $40 million dollars invested on
the overnight money market and was seeking alternative longer-term, tax
effective investments. After discussions with various merchant banks it
settled on a scheme that involved the transfer of funds through a
series of bank transfers from Melbourne to the Cook Islands, where the
funds were eventually deposited.

Interest paid on the deposit was subject to Cook Islands withholding
tax of 5 per cent. The taxpayer then claimed the interest was exempt
from Australian tax pursuant to a provision that formerly exempted from
Australian tax income subject to foreign tax in its country of source.

The Commissioner attacked the arrangement, arguing the true source of
the income was Australia, where the scheme was devised and the money
originally deposited, not the Cook Islands, where it was finally
deposited. The Commissioner argued in the alternative that the
arrangements should be struck down on the basis of the general anti-
avoidance provision in the income tax legislation.

The Federal Court rejected the first argument, finding that the source
of the interest income was the Cook Islands because the taxpayer
completed the deposit contract in the Cook Islands, and ignoring the
earlier steps in the scheme.

The Court agreed that several of the elements required for the
operation of the general anti-avoidance provision were satisfied, but
concluded that the principal element required by the provision, that
the scheme be one of the dominant purpose of which was to obtain a tax
benefit, had not been satisfied. The dominant purpose of the scheme,
the Court said, was a commercial one, to obtain the maximum return on
the money investment after the payment of all applicable costs,
including tax.

The effect of the decision is to revive the "choice" doctrine used by
courts to decimate a predecessor general anti-avoidance provision.
Under the choice doctrine, the general anti-avoidance provision had no
application if the taxpayer were faced with two commercial choices and
chose the option that attracted the lower tax liability.

If the decision is not reversed by the High Court, legislative
amendment of the anti-avoidance provision is likely. In the meantime,
the scope of the anti-avoidance measure is severely constrained.

AUSTRALIA: GOODWILL

The Australian Taxation Office has recently lost two important cases on
the meaning of goodwill for tax purposes. The decisions open the door
to considerable tax benefits for many owners of small businesses.

The meaning of goodwill is relevant to a capital gains tax concession
that exempts from taxation 50 per cent of the gain realised on the sale
of a small business (with a net value of less than $2 million) that is
attributable to the sale of goodwill associated with the business.

In the first case, Case 59/95, the taxpayer sold a taxi business,
including the car, equipment, shares in a cab co-operative, and taxi
licence and attributed the amount of consideration received in respect
of the taxi licence (calculated as the excess of consideration received
over the market value of the car, equipment, and shares) as payment for
"goodwill" and thus eligible for the 50 per cent exemption.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal agreed with the taxpayer's
characterisation, concluding that the value of the licence was in its
power to confer monopoly privileges to the holder and in the context of
a taxi business, these privileges amounted to the goodwill of the
business.

In the second case, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Krakos
Investments (not yet reported), the taxpayer sold a hotel and pub
business and leased the business premises to the new owners. The
Commissioner of Taxation characterised the significant payment received
by the vendor as a lease premium, reflecting the location value to the
business, while the taxpayer claimed the payment was consideration for
the sale of business goodwill.

The full Federal Court agreed with the taxpayer's characterisation. The
decision is likely to have a major impact on the tax consequences of
sales of small businesses, as it makes it very difficult for the
Commissioner to carve out part of the sale price and attribute it to
factors apart from general goodwill.

NEW ZEALAND: DEDUCTIONS FOR WARRANTY CLAIMS

In CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has allowed a deduction for
expected warranty claims. Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited
("Mitsubishi") sold vehicles to dealers for on-sale and indemnified
those dealers for a warranty provided on sale against defects in
material or workmanship appearing within one year or 20,000 kilometres,
whichever occurred earlier. Evidence was given in the High Court that
in 1988 63 per cent of vehicles sold gave rise to a subsequent warranty
claim for which Mitsubishi indemnified the relevant dealers.

Mitsubishi deducted the estimated warranty costs for tax purposes in
the year in which the vehicles were sold. The Commissioner subsequently
disallowed the deduction. The case was argued on different bases:

- Whether the estimated warranty expense was properly deductible as
being "incurred" under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("Act")
in the year of sale of the vehicle;

- Whether, if no deduction was available under section 104, the
estimated warranty costs nevertheless reduced the assessable income
properly derived in the year of sale, ie the purchase price was not
fully earned until the warranty period expired (at the latest, one year
later); or,

Whether the warranty income should be spread under the accruals rules
contained in sections 64B to 64M of the Act.

The High Court held that a deduction was properly allowable under
section 104. The Court of Appeal held that a deduction was not
allowable under section 104 because the estimated warranty expense was
not incurred. However, the Court held that to the extent that the price
for the vehicle included an amount for the warranty, that amount was
not derived in the year of sale but should be spread over the period of
the warranty under ordinary principles. The Court of Appeal also held
that the accrual rules did not apply to the particular contact. The
Privy Council disagreed with the Court of Appeal and held that a
deduction was properly allowable under section 104.

Their Lordships considered the terms of the warranty to determine
whether Mitsubishi became "definitely committed" to the estimated
expenditure in the year of sale of each vehicle. They agreed with the
Court of Appeal that the effect of the warranty was not a promise that
the vehicle was free from defects on sale. They held that any liability
was contingent on a defect appearing and notification being made within
the warranty period and until that occurred, no liability was incurred.

Nevertheless, although that conclusion on the scope of the warranty
resulted in the Court of Appeal finding that the ability to deduct was
deferred to a later income year, that was not the end of the matter for
their Lordships.

They were not prepared to determine deductibility by rather arcane
legal distinctions between contingency and defeasibility as had been
done in earlier cases and by the Court of Appeal. The question was
whether with all the surrounding circumstances a legal obligation in
the future can be said to have accrued. In making that determination
theoretical contingencies were disregarded. Given the data available,
their Lordships held that the defects were a matter of existing fact,
not future contingency, as 63 per cent of the vehicles sold were found
to display defects within the warranty period. Those defects must have
existed at the time of sale.

The contingency that owners might choose not to seek repairs was likely
to be quite small and would not make a material difference to the
accuracy of the estimated expenditure. Accordingly, their Lordships
held that the warranty costs were deductible in the year of sale under
section 104 of the Act.

The finding on deductibility made it unnecessary for their Lordships to
reach a view on either of the other issues. However, they did comment
in relation to the second issue that, because Mitsubishi had not made a
separate charge for the warranty, in their view there was no
justification for treating part of the price of the vehicle as if it
were a separate charge for the warranty. They indicated that in their
opinion the full price should have been recognised as income and there
could be no deferral of income for the warranty costs.

They would not have been prepared, if a deduction was not allowable, to
"manipulate" the ordinary rules for the recognition of income to give
such a deferral.

The decision of the Privy Council does seem to have changed the test
for determining when expenditure is incurred for the purpose of being
deductible under the Act. For the reasons set out below, however, this
change may not have much practical significance.

SPAIN/PORTUGAL TAX TREATY

The ratification of the Spain/Portugal income tax treaty signed in
Madrid on October 26, 1993, was published in the Spanish Official State
Bulletin on November 7, 1995. It replaces one since 1968 and addresses
the problems arising from the new financial relationship between the
two countries.

Section 10 of the new treaty retains the right to tax dividends in the
payers's country. The rate of tax may not exceed 10 per cent if the
recipient holds 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of the
paying company directly.

Income from Government Stock may be taxed in both states.

Interest may be taxed in the contracting state of origin at a rate not
exceeding 15 per cent.

Capital Gains

While the 1968 agreement permitted the country of residence only to tax
capital gains, the new agreement provides that gains may be subject to
tax in the state where the company, whose shares have been sold, is
resident if the vendor has, either directly or indirectly, held at
least 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of the said company
for the previous twelve months.

Companies, whose assets consist of land and buildings, may be liable
for tax in the country in which the lands and buildings are located.

Limitation of Benefits

No reductions in or exemptions from the taxation of dividends, capital
gains, royalties or interest shall apply in the case of companies
engaged in the management of securities or other assets if more than 50
per cent of the authorised capital is held by shareholders who are not
resident in the state where the company in question is domiciled. This
is to prevent the carrying out of circular investment operations.

The treaty covers income tax and surcharge in India, and income tax in
Malta. However, the income tax on petroleum produced in Malta, is not
covered.

Business profits would be taxable in the source country, if the
enterprise carries on business through the permanent establishment
(PE), therein. However, profits, directly or indirectly attributable to
the PE, will only be taxable if the PE takes an active part in
negotiating, concluding or fulfilling contracts entered into by the
enterprise. Attribution will be to the extent of the contribution of
the PE in those transactions. The PE provision is not applicable to
insurance profits.

The term PE, among other fixed places of businesses, includes an
offshore drilling site. A building site or construction or assembly
project or connected supervisory activities is a PE, if it lasts for
more than 6 months. Certain activities are deemed a PE. Exploration of
the seabed, and its sub-soil or exploration of natural resources
situated there as well as activities, which are complimentary or
auxiliary to such activities. Also included is the use or installation
of substantial equipment or connected supervisory activities.

Dividends, interest, royalties and fees for services, and technical
service fees, are taxable in both the states. Tax in the source state,
may not exceed on dividends in India, 15 per cent, reduced to 10 per
cent, in the hands of a 25 per cent participating company. In Malta,
the tax may not exceed that chargeable on the profits out of which the
dividends are paid. On interest the maximum rate is 10 per cent.

respectively. Total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or
supply of the specified property or right is also be covered by the
term 'royalties'.

US TREATY UPDATE

Kazakstan

Ratification of a negotiated income tax treaty with Kazakstan has been
delayed because of provisions in Kazak law permitting the use of
anonymous bank accounts and protecting investor secrecy. It has been
reported that a procedure will be adopted by the Kazak government that
will allow foreign governments to have access to anonymous accounts.

Netherlands Antilles

The protocol terminating the exemption for interest income that appears
in Article VIII, the sole remaining provision of the income tax treaty
between the US and the Netherlands Antilles, for most taxpayers was
submitted to the Senate for its approval. The protocol will allow
Article VIII to continue in existence for debt paid to finance
subsidiaries in connection with Eurobond offerings issued and
outstanding on or before October 15, 1984.

Switzerland

Negotiations regarding the open issues between the US and Swiss
governments are scheduled for early January. Not surprisingly, the
limitation on benefits provision which the US demands as part of its
treaty programme is a sticking point.

Ireland

Negotiations between delegations from the Republic of Ireland and the
US were held in December and apparently significant progress was made
regarding outstanding issues. As in the negotiations with Switzerland,
the limitation on benefits article is the principal sticking point.

France

Instruments of ratification of the new income tax treaty were exchanged
on December 30, 1995, causing the new treaty to be effective as of
January 1, 1996.

INTERNATIONAL TAX BOOKS

The Taxation of International Entertainers And Athletes

by Daniel Sandler.

The Chartered Institute of Taxation, Kluwer Law International;
Hardcover, 356 pages

Why are entertainers and athletes singled out for special tax
treatment? In his introduction the author notes that they are probably
the most mobile individuals in the business world. As they become more
well known income may be derived in many different countries and
residential ties to a particular country may lessen. Taxation of such
individuals in a source country may be problematic given the short stay
and the lack of any strong economic ties with that country.

The author also refers to concerns expressed in the 1987 OECD study on
taxation of the entertainment business that imply that entertainers
either evade tax or at best negligently prepare their returns.
Certainly he notes that perceived abuses by such individuals are better
reported than abuses by other taxpayers who do not enjoy celebrity
status.

The central focus of this book is a comparative analysis of the tax
treatment of non-resident entertainers and athletes in seven countries
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States. The key themes are firstly the question of allocation of
income and secondly enforcement. Most countries adopt withholding
mechanisms. Given the complexity of the entertainment industry a number
of issues are involved depending on the nature of the source of income.
The clash between personal service income and a royalty income is
particularly difficult.

The analysis of each country proceeds through an examination of the
taxation of non-residence generally and the treatment of non-residents
employed or carrying on business in the particular country. It also
considers the treatment of royalties and the general withholding
arrangements, as well as those specifically applicable to entertainers
and athletes. In each case, the effect of tax treaties on domestic law
is considered, as well as the application of VAT.

The OECD study on the taxation of entertainers and athletes refers to
sophisticated tax avoidance and an industry increasingly categorised by
loosely connected chains of companies, partnerships and joint ventures.
However, the principal focus of planning and indeed, anti-avoidance
rules apart from withholding, analysed in the book revolves around the
use of loan-out and slave companies. In each jurisdiction, the
treatment of such entities is considered in detail.

A chapter is devoted to a detailed analysis of article 17 of the OECD
model convention. He covers the history and interpretation of the
article in great detail. It illustrates some of the anomalies in the
rule where although singers and actors are covered by the article their
entourage is not. Other closely related professions who are equally
mobile such as "super models" also appear to be excluded.

This is a thorough and detailed book. For example in considering
article 17 he analyses in some detail the concerns of each of the
countries considered in relation to their concerns on the application
of article 17 in the context of their domestic laws.

Many tax books today are padded out with appendices comprising
voluminous source material. This is certainly not the case here. The
tax treaties of all of the countries have been carefully researched and
the results are contained in tables identifying the date when the
treaty entered into force, articles analogous to article 17,
limitations on the application of the article within the treaty and
other relevant comments.

A further chapter is devoted to illustrating the rules by reference to
examples. They comprise a pop group on a world tour and a professional
athlete participating in a number of tournaments around the world.

This is not a book about tax planning. Indeed the concerns of the
author expressed in the conclusion are for effective and efficient
taxation of non-resident entertainers and athletes and the policy
issues relating to it. The bulk of the book covers income tax although
VAT is also considered.

It is a highly thoughtful, thoroughly researched and very readable
book. It is clearly a must read for anyone involved in this area. Its
only drawback is the absence of an index although the lengthy
bibliography is extremely useful.
