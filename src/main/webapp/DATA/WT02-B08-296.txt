<p>
The influence of the ocean on our climate is a result of its enormous capacity to store heat...the entire atmosphere can only store as much heat as the top 3 meters (9.8 feet) of the ocean.  
<p>
The oceans absorb the sun's heat and evaporate water into the air.  The water falls as rain and the released heat drives the atmosphere and creates winds.  The winds, in turn, drive ocean currents and redistribute heat over the globe.

The above figure compares heat storage as measured from ocean sensors and
TOPEX/Poseidon satellite data.
The calculation error for satellite data, shown as line thickness, is half that of ocean sensors.  
<p>
Measuring the ocean's heat storage has traditionally been done using 100's to 1000's of ocean sensors.  This may be done more efficiently by satellite.  During TOPEX/Poseidon's first month of operation it provided more data about the ocean's surface than had been collected by ships during the previous 100 years!
