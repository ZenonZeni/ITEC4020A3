<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Basics</STRONG></FONT><P>

Investments are generally divided into three types - stocks, bonds and cash. While you may be
familiar with other types of investments, like real estate, these three are most commonly used
with
savings concepts. Therefore, before anyone makes a major savings investment decision, they
should
first understand what these three types of investments are and how they are used.
<P>

<STRONG>Stocks  </STRONG><BR>
Stocks represent equity in a company. That means you actually own a piece of a company, and will
have
an opportunity to benefit from the company's success. The price of a stock may go up and down,
sometimes quite a bit.
<P>
<STRONG>Bonds </STRONG><BR> 
Bonds are loans. In effect, you are lending money to a government entity or to a company or
institution.
Interest is earned on the money you lend. Another term commonly used for bonds is fixed income
investments because they generally pay a set, or "fixed", interest rate.
<P>
There is an easy way to remember the basic difference between stocks and bonds: with stocks, you
own; with bonds, you loan. The prices of bonds don't tend to move up and down as much as stocks.
<P>
<STRONG>Cash  </STRONG><BR>
Cash is represented by investments such as money market instruments, CDs, and Treasury bills.
The
value of cash investments are generally less volatile than stocks and bonds.
<P>

<STRONG>Stocks vs. Bonds vs. Cash: a historical perspective</STRONG><BR>

Although past performance is not a guarantee of future results, the
historical results of stocks, bonds, and cash over a long period of time may give you an idea of
what to
expect when you make your investment decisions. A good period of time to consider is 20 years or
longer for long-term investing.
<P>

The table below shows the returns of each of these asset classes over the past 20 years. The
differences in returns - which, as you can see, are considerable - may help you understand why
someone may choose an investment that may be more volatile in order to achieve the possibility of
greater
long-term rewards.
<P>

<P>

Investors during this period (1976­1995) got what they bargained for. The Volatility/Risk column
indicates that stock prices (represented by the S&P 500<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>) bounced around more than bond and cash prices (represented by
the Salomon Brothers Long-Term High Grade Bond Index<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP> and U.S. 90-day Treasury bills), but that stocks over the long-term
delivered the best return by far. The last column shows that over this twenty-year period, a
hypothetical
$100 invested in stocks would have grown to almost $1,524. That's a 14.59% annual return.
<P>
Bond prices bounced around less than stock prices and the average return was
slightly
lower at 10.58%. The average return of cash was much lower than that of stocks and bonds, and the up-and-down movement was also much lower. (Keep in mind that past performance
is no guarantee of future results).
<P>

<STRONG>Why not invest just in cash?</STRONG><BR>
Investors commonly ask: If cash (generally, money
market funds) can provide a positive return with relatively little risk, why would anybody
invest in
anything
other than cash? Why should anyone subject him or herself to stocks and bonds, which "bounce
around" much more?
<P>
One answer is that cash generally only keeps up with the current rate of inflation, or
outperforms it by
only a little. This means that at the end of an extended period, an all-cash portfolio may not
have grown
that much more than inflation. 
<P>
To "outrun" inflation and "grow" your portfolio, you may need the higher returns that stocks and
bonds
have historically delivered. Admittedly, stocks and bonds are more volatile than cash - but if
you seek
higher returns, you have to be willing to live with greater ups and downs.
<P>
Accepting more risk may result in more money over time. People who refuse to assume any
investment
risk may be disappointed by the size of their nest egg and find that their retirement income may
gradually erode over time if it is outpaced by inflation.
