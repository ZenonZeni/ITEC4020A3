<P><B>Principles of Technology</B> is a two-year high school course in applied science.  It provides an understanding of the principles 
of mechanical, fluid, electrical and thermal systems, and the mathematics associated with them.  The full two-year course includes
14 units of instruction focused on the principles that your students will need to understand if they want to compete in today's high
technology job market.
<P><B>Technical Concepts</B> is Energy Concepts' laboratory system of experiments and equipment to implement <B>Principles of Technology</B>
<P>This system solves problems relating to classroom management, such as size, inventory control and storage. From a technical point of view, the system assures accuracy and repeatability of each laboratory experiment.
<P>Energy Concepts called upon its 40 years of experience in developing systems for teaching technical subjects.  ECI engineers developed new mechanical breadbording techniques that allow students to perform experiments on a bech top, and allows them to accomplish each experiment with accuracy, repeatability and speed.
<P>Most important, the ECI includes a clearly written and professionally illustrated laboratory manual.  This manual provides the only specific laboratory setup and easy-to-use, step-by-step procedures abailable to implement <B>Principles of Technology</B>.  ECI's laboratory manual is keyed to the <B>Principles of Technology</B> text and instructor's guide.
<P>More high schools, technical centers and colleges have chosen Energy Concepts' <B>Technical Concepts</B> lab system to implement <B>Principles of Technology</B> than any other lab system available (over 1000 labs have been installed).  Our comprehensive lab manuals, supplementary computer math models, reliable laboratory equipment, and time-saving equipment management system provide a complete and unparalleled laboratory package for implementing <B>Principles of Technology</B>.
<DL>
	<DT><BR><B>Lab Manual</B>
	<DD><BR>ECI's Laboratory Manual is designed to supplement the <B>Principles of Technology</B> and help the student develop a thorough understanding of the subject matter.
	<P>Clearly written and professionally illustrated, the manual provides the most specific laboratory setup and easy-to-use procedures available.  Two-color highlighting is used to aid the student.  And with its loose leaf design, it always stays open to the selected page, plus it allows instructors to easily photocopy individual sheets as desired.  (Energy Concepts permits users to reproduce pages without any further permission required.)
	<P>ECI's Lab Manual offers oversized schematics and wiring diagrams, and pictorially leads the student through each step of the experiments.  Text is kept to a minimum.
	<P>More than 40 years of experience in producing technical training systems is reflected in the courseware quality.  ECI lab manuals are carefully researched to assure that each experiment provides relevant, meaningful knowledge.  A Glossary of Terms is included to aid the student's understanding.<BR>
	
	<DT><BR><B>Instructor's Guide and Instructor's Resource Manual</B>
	<DD><BR>A comprehensive Instructor's Guide and Instructor's Resource Manual are included to provide coordination and efficient equipment utilization.
	<P>The Instructor's Guide includes sample data values for easy comparison to the students' results, plus answers to all quiz questions in the Lab Manual.
	<P>The Instructor's Resource Manual provides an strategy for efficient use of the equipment, and gives supplemental information.  Copy masters are provided to make overhead transparencies for classroom instruction.<BR>

	<DT><BR><B>Computer-Aided Instruction</B>
	<DD><BR><I>Computer Math Models</I> for <B>Principles of Technology</B> is a teaching and learning resource developed for use with ECI's Lab Manual and laboratory system.  This computer program supplements the <B>Principles of Technology</B> curriculum, providing immediate feedback on data collected during labs, and correlating directly to the Lab and Instructor's Manuals.
	<P>Students progress at their own pace, using onscreen help to answer questions related to lab setup, data collection, and calculations.  In labs where data is used to plot a graph, the program automatically saves student data in a graph file that may be plotted to a compatible printer.  Each experiment includes a set of 10 true/false questions.<BR>

	<DT><BR><B>Laboratory Furniture</B>
	<DD><BR>ECI's modular design lab furniture allows a wide range of custom configurations.  From free-standing, island-style workstations with convenient storage bases, to mobile units, this versatile lab furniture fits beautifully into every lab.
	<P>Function always folows form with ECI lab furniture.  Die-cut foam storage tray inserts organize your equipment and assist in component inventory.  And each drawer and door has its own key lock to provide added inventory control during and after class.
	<P>ECI lab furniture is constructed with fine craftsmanship.  Durable high-quality materials (no particleboard) and rugged hardware ensure what it will stand up to years of use in the most demanding classrooms.  A variety of wood grains and color combinations are available.<BR>
