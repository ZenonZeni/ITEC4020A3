<H2>CI Pioneers Aquaculture<BR> Technology in Gulf of California</H2>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/NFF/Caravaj.jpg" ALT="Caravaj.jpg - 4.8 K" WIDTH=164 HEIGHT=126 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>Overfishing, climatic changes, and environmental pollution in Mexico's Gulf of California have caused a dramatic fall in fish catches in recent years and have jeopardized the future of the Gulf's marine life.  "When I first came
to the coastal town of Guaymas 15 years ago, a thriving fishing
fleet in the Gulf of California provided 60 percent of Mexico's
fish catch from abundant, biodiverse waters," recalls Machangeles
Carvajal, CI's Gulf of California Program Coordinator. "Since
then, an economic collapse in the region has followed the gulf's
ecological decline. My work aims to simultaneously revive the local
economies and the ecosystems." 

<P>With professional background in
both marine biology and community development and a lifelong
passion for the sea, Machangeles is helping the region's coastal
communities find economic alternatives to current destructive
overharvesting of fisheries. Machangeles is a leading innovator in a technology known as aquaculture that cultivates fish and shellfish in their
natural environment. Machangeles not only pioneered the development of the aquaculture technique for scallops, she is helping a number of groups, including an all women's group, set up Mexico's very first scallop aquaculture farms in the town
of El Golfo de Santa Clara located in the Biosphere Reserve of
the upper Gulf of California.  

<P>In another project, Machangeles and her colleagues test experimental
shrimping nets to replace standard ones that damage life on the
ocean floor.  Although they are in the early stages of testing, their plan is to identify a net that yields a large
shrimp catch, while minimizing the number of other species killed, and to design an education campaign to promote its use. 

<P>&quot;Machangeles
has an exceptional ability to catalyze people to collective action,&quot;
said Alejandro Robles, CI's Mexico Program Executive Director.
&quot;Her energy has been instrumental in building a cooperative
spirit among the academic institutions, coastal communities, and
thousands of fishermen of the Gulf of California.&quot; </TD>

<TD><H2>Land Shortage Spurs Raid on CI Biological Station</H2>

<P>
Chiapas, Mexico: Armed groups of local Tzeltal farmers twice looted CI's Ocotal
Biological Station in the Selva Lacandona region in southern Mexico
in October. The field station helps CI coordinate biological research
in the northern section of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve,
Mexico's largest remaining expanse of primary tropical rain forest.

<P>
The attacks came in the wake of long-building tensions over the
Tzeltales' struggle to find new farmland. Due to population growth,
obsolete agricultural practices, and cattle-ranching on the best
lands, small farmers have exhausted their land and are demanding
more. The only large tracts remaining, however, are contained
within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve or are inhabited by
the other indigenous peoples. In recent months, Tzeltal farmers
have also pushed into territory belonging to the indigenous Lacandon
Maya people (<A HREF="../newsfrnt/newsfrnt.htm">see NFF 1:1</A>). 

<P>
Since September 1995, CI Mexico's Selva
Lacandona program coordinator Victor Hugo Hernandez has been mediating
with government officials and members of these local communities
to work out these problems. But inviting indigenous leaders, farmers,
and government officials to tackle the complicated disputes over
land tenure issues is only the first step. 

<P>
Defusing pressures
over land tenure issues requires development of economic alternatives
for farmers, often taking several years to get programs up and
running. &quot;The problem is, conservationists don't operate
in a vacuum,&quot; remarked CI Vice President James Nations. &quot;You
can't say, 'Hey, just hang on until we can get our program off
the ground.' Conflicts can ignite, just when you think the stage
is set for positive alternatives.&quot; </TD>

Amsterdam, The Netherlands: CI President, Russell A. Mittermeier, received the
Order of the Golden Ark Award from His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard
of the Netherlands in a ceremony at the Soestdijk Palace on November
4, 1995. The Order of the Golden Ark was established by Prince
Bernhard in 1971 to recognize people committed to international
nature conservation and its recipients include Richard Leakey and
Sir David Attenborough. 

<P>
As he bestowed the honor, Prince
Bernhard cited Dr. Mittermeier for "...his leadership in,
and promotion of, the importance of biological diversity on a
global scale, his efforts to identify those areas of highest priority,
and his commitment to developing conservation programs to ensure
their sustainability."
