Coenzyme Q-10 is used to prevent heart

pressure. When given Coenzyme Q-10 on a regular basis, laboratory animals lived
56-percent longer.  For a human, that adds up to 43 more years of life!  Recommended:
30 mgs of Coenzyme Q- 10 daily.

Essential fatty acids of healthy newborns and newborns at risk were compared. The
presence of essential fatty acids in human maternal milk was measured. The milk of
healthy mothers, of mothers with preterm delivery (37th week of gestation), and of
diabetic mothers were compared. These observations indicate an absence or serious
deficit of some essential fatty acids in certain groups of high-risk newborns as well
as in the milk of diabetic mothers and of mothers with preterm delivery.

<B>Editor's note:</B> Reminder - increasing trans-fatty acids decreases essential fatty
acids. Check with your obstetrician for a recommendation for an essential fatty acid
supplement. Or: consume half an avocado on a daily basis. Your fatty acid profile is
a factor in your baby's brain development.

<A NAME="IMPOTENCE"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>SEXUAL IMPOTENCE IN MEN</CENTER></H3>
<CENTER>IMPOTENCE RELATED TO HEART OR
<BR>BLOOD VESSEL DISORDER</CENTER>

<P>
Men with heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes are up to four 
times more likely to become totally impotent than men without these diseases, 
according to a new study of nearly 1,300 men aged 40 to 70. Smoking, says the 
study, boosts impotence odds even higher.

<P>Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the research showed for 
     the first time that middle-aged and older men with low levels of high-density 
     HDL were more likely to become impotent than men with higher HDLs. 
     Irwin Goldstein, MD, a urologist and researcher in the Massachusetts Male 
     Aging Study, from which the impotence study results were taken, says the 
     findings should be good news because they show that impotence is not 
     necessarily tied to aging, as many doctors traditionally thought.  
     Impotence is a possible warning sign of heart or blood vessel disorder, 
     because blood flow is related to erection.  The good news is that men have 
     some control over HDL levels through lifestyle habits.  Goldstein warns:  
     "When blood flow to the penis is impaired, it's likely that circulation to
      other organs in the body, including the heart, is also restricted." [See our 
      article on Grapeseed Oil, page 10, for an easy remedy to increase HDL.  
      Also see pages 126 to 133 in Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide, 
      to learn how chelation therapy can help raise your HDL levels.]

<CENTER>A BERRY FROM INDIA FOR WEIGHT LOSS</CENTER>

        An herbal extract derived from an age-old berry is proving to be the new
weight-loss success! It's called hydroxycitrate and has been researched by
Hoffmann-La Roche along with many other science teams. Naturally-occurring
hydroxycitrate curbs appetite and inhibits fat and cholesterol synthesis. Preliminary
studies suggest that the effective dose of hydroxycitrate may be reduced when used in
conjunction with niacin-bound chromium. Available on health store shelves as
CitriMax, each capsule contains 250 mg of hydroxycitrate and 100 micrograms of
chromium polynicotinate. Recommended: One capsule CitriMax, three times a day.
