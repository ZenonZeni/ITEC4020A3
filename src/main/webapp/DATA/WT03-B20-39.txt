<H4><a name="3.16">Remaining Challenges and Opportunities</H4></a>
Utility sector restructuring and improved technologies for monitoring and controlling building
energy use will likely lead to major changes in building energy markets over the next decade. The
overall effects of these changes are impossible to predict at this time, but utility support of
demand-side management programs has already been reduced or refocused in some areas and
may undergo major near-term changes as utilities compete more effectively in less regulated
markets. A key challenge for Federal and State policymakers will be determining how to
encourage the continuation of effective utility demand-side management efforts-or comparable
efforts-in the context of these more competitive markets.<BR>
<P>
The barriers to the entry of radically new technologies, such as compact fluorescent light bulbs and
heat-pump water heaters, can be especially difficult for manufacturers to overcome and represent
another key challenge. Federal and State policymakers must strike an appropriate balance between
regulatory mandates and voluntary programs that accelerate the market entry of such technology,
especially in areas where major technology changes could result in very large efficiency and
economic gains for most consumers and the Nation.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.17">Industry: Using Energy-Efficient Technologies To Improve Productivity and Reduce Waste</H4></a>
U.S. industries form the backbone of our Nation's economic strength. The industrial sector
encompasses more than 360,000 manufacturing, forestry, agricultural, construction, and mining
facilities. These facilities employ more than 28 million people, or about one-quarter of the total
U.S. work force and produce more than $900 billion in goods and services. In producing our
material goods in an increasingly competitive global market and providing high-wage jobs,
industry consumes vast amounts of energy and creates a substantial public burden in the form of
pollution. Industry faces the ongoing challenges of improving productivity, enhancing product
quality, and complying with environmental requirements. Through strategic R&D, technology
demonstrations, information and education, industry recognition, and market facilitation, the
Administration supports industry efforts to<a name="ip"></a><a href="ch3bx4.html"> improve productivity</a> while cutting energy use, emissions, and waste generation. <BR>
<P>
Industry uses about 38 percent of the Nation's primary energy for fuel and feedstocks, for which
the manufacturing sector alone pays about $100 billion per year. This energy is consumed in
roughly equal amounts in electricity generation and in the direct use of natural gas and petroleum-
based fuels. Industry accounts for more than one-quarter of total U.S. petroleum consumption,
approximately one-third of which is for petrochemical feedstocks. <BR>
<P>
The industrial sector also has a major impact on the environment. Each year, industry produces
more than 14 billion tons of hazardous and nonhazardous waste products. Direct consumption of
fossil fuels generated about 290 million metric tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide
emissions in 1993, accounting for one-fifth of the Nation's total carbon dioxide emissions from
human activities. Including industry's share of emissions from electricity generation, industrial
energy use accounted for one-third of the carbon dioxide emissions. Industry's fuel and electricity
use also generated about 7.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide (38 percent of the U.S. total) and
5.3 million metric tons of nitrogen oxides (25 percent of the total).<BR>
<P>
Between 1972 and 1991, industry reduced the amount of energy required for every dollar of output
(energy intensity) by 30 percent, with two-thirds of these savings from improvements in energy
efficiency. Much of this decline in energy intensity occurred in response to higher energy prices
and increased concern about the reliability of energy supplies and markets. When energy prices
began to fall in the mid-1980s, however, the rate of efficiency improvement also slowed; between
1970 and 1980, energy intensity declined by 2.5 percent per year, but the rate of decline has
dropped to below 1 percent in recent years.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.18">Partnering With Industry in Developing New Technologies</H4></a>
A number of industries facing market challenges are curtailing R&D at a time when, in fact, there
is a strong need for U.S. industry to pursue the development and adoption of innovative, cost-
effective, environmentally superior technologies that will help the industry remain competitive in
global markets. Aside from the ordinary risk of conducting R&D, firms that would be potential
buyers of new technologies are often reluctant to invest in first-of-a-kind process equipment, even
if pilot-tested and determined to be technically sound and cost-effective. Administration policy
focuses Federal support to help sustain R&D efforts and reduce investment risks for energy
technologies that can boost overall productivity, cut end-of-pipe cleanup costs, and promote
pollution prevention.<BR>
<P>
Government-Industry Consortia Research and Commercialization. An example of government-
industry partnership is the joint effort by the Department of Energy and the American Iron and
Steel Institute to develop an energy-efficient, economically competitive, continuous process to
replace conventional steelmaking operations involving coke ovens, blast furnaces, and basic
oxygen furnaces. Another is the development of advanced fluid catalytic cracking units for the
U.S. refining industry that can reduce oil consumption by better tailoring product yields to meet
reformulated gasoline formulas and to achieve higher yields per barrel processed.<BR>
<P>
Industries of the Future. The Industries of the Future program aligns Federal investment in
technology research, development, and deployment with the needs and expectations of technology
users in the private sector. Industries of the Future focuses on seven industries that are vital to the
manufacturing sector and the health of the U.S. economy-steel, aluminum, chemicals, petroleum
refining, glass, forest and paper products, and metal casting. These industries account for about 80
percent of the energy consumed in U.S. manufacturing and more than 90 percent of U.S. Industrial waste, and they represent the biggest opportunities to increase energy efficiency and reduce the generation of waste.<BR>
<P>
Industries of the Future establishes partnerships between industry and Government to aid in the
development and application of energy efficient, environmentally beneficial technologies while also
improving industrial competitiveness. Industry participants first outline a vision that reflects the
dynamic impact of market, business, social, and regulatory drivers in their industries. The vision
defines the context within which technology development priorities are set. The industry then
develops a technology road map toward achieving the vision, which the Department of Energy
draws upon to shape an R&D program that is also aligned with the Department's mission. The
result is a Government R&D agenda that is well matched to the technology needs of our vital
process industries.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.19">Accelerating Deployment of Energy-Efficiency Technologies</H4></a>
Performance and cost information on efficient technologies is not readily accessible to all
participants in the marketplace who need it, especially small- and medium-sized companies. And
because the information needs of individual industries are so diverse and fragmented, available
information is often confusing and inconsistent and does not get to the decisionmakers who need
it. <BR>
<P>
The Administration supports programs that help transfer the results of R&D efforts to industry
and encourage the adoption of state-of-the-art technology. These programs increase awareness of
opportunities to save energy, lower costs, and reduce wastes, particularly for smaller firms; and
they help create markets for new technology and services. Specific ongoing programs are
highlighted below.<BR>
<P>
National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE3).
NICE3 is a cost-shared grant program with businesses, States, and Federal agencies (the
Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency) to advance competitiveness by
demonstrating technology applications that increase productivity and energy efficiency and reduce
wastes. Projects are selected on the basis of economic profitability, potential energy and waste
savings, cost-efficiency, capability, degree of innovation, and resources leveraged. Twenty-nine
projects have already been funded through the NICE3 program; nine have already produced
commercially viable technologies that are currently operating in industry to reduce costs, energy
use, and industrial waste.<BR>
<P>
By the year 2000, the current NICE3 projects are projected to result in savings to industry of about
$8 billion per year. This results from a Federal investment of only $11.4 million through fiscal
year 1995.<BR>
<P>
Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Centers/Industrial Assessment Centers. This program uses the
expertise and resources of engineering faculty and students at major U.S. universities to provide
no-cost energy efficiency and waste reduction assessments for the small- and medium-sized
manufacturers that make up about 64 percent of the manufacturing sector. These firms often do
not have in-house expertise or staff to address energy efficiency or waste minimization
improvements. The average energy-efficiency audit recommends improvements that can lead to
energy savings of about 4 billion Btu, with annual dollar savings of about $40,000. Since 1976,
these university-based centers have conducted more than 5,100 industrial energy audits or
assessments, providing approximately 1,000 university students with energy management
experience. The investments made as a result of these recommendations have saved industry more
than $500 million in energy bills and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by about 300,000 metric
tons of carbon-equivalent.<BR>
<P>
By the close of 1994, Industrial Assessment Centers had conducted more than 5,000 assessments,
helping manufacturers save $517 million and 94 trillion Btu worth of energy and eliminating
200,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases (carbon equivalent)-all for a total Federal investment of
only $27 million.<BR>
<P>
Motor Challenge. There are substantial opportunities for improving the efficiency of electric motor
use, beyond improving the motor itself, through improved integration of motors, drives, and
driven equipment to optimize performance of the overall "motor system." Strengthening the
existing market capability to provide higher performance, systems-oriented products and services
is central to capturing these opportunities for greater efficiency improvements in the electric motor
system and other industrial equipment markets.<BR>
<P>
The Motor Challenge program will increase market penetration of energy-efficient industrial
electric motor systems and encourage industry to adopt a systems approach in developing,
purchasing, and managing equipment. The Motor Challenge engages industry, Government, and
utility partners in information exchange, conferences, seminars, and training activities. Showcase
demonstrations are sponsored with industry partners to demonstrate existing or new applications
of efficient electric motor systems. The Motor Challenge is also developing an electric motor
systems data base that will contain performance data on motor systems in practical applications,
and it is working with industry to develop market transformation strategies to stimulate market
demand for motor system equipment with improved efficiency. <BR>
<P>
By the year 2000, the Motor Challenge program will save 25  billion kilowatts per year. This will
reduce emissions by the equivalent of 6 million metric tons of carbon per year.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="3.20">Remaining Challenges and Opportunities</H4></a>
The different timeframes between R&D outcomes and regulatory requirements represent a
significant challenge for Federal programs designed to help industry develop and deploy energy-
efficient pollution prevention technologies. Innovative technologies can take a decade or more to
develop into commercial products, while the time given industry to comply with certain regulatory
requirements is often shorter. The Administration is coordinating activities that support technology
development for energy efficiency and pollution prevention with the evolving system of
environmental regulation, described more fully in Chapter 6. By supporting efficient and clean
technologies that would contribute to a more flexible and cost-effective environmental
management system, the Administration's programs will ensure that a cleaner and more
competitive industrial sector will emerge in the 21st century.<BR>
