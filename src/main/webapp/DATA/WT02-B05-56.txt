Executive Summary<BR>
<BR>
Overview </H3>
In its first full year of activity, the Center for Democracy and Technology
(CDT) has emerged as a leading voice in the critical public policy debates
affecting the future of free expression and privacy in the Information Age.
Founded in December, 1994, the Center's mission is to develop public policies
that preserve and advance democratic values and constitutional civil liberties
on the Internet and other interactive communications media.<BR>
<BR>
CDT pursues its mission through public policy working groups, public 
interest/industry
coalition building efforts, policy research, litigation, public education,
and grass-roots organizing. CDT relies on a combination of staff expertise
in relevant law and technology, combined with a unique consultation process
that brings together diverse interests from across the political spectrum,
public interest community, and the communications industry to address critical
public policy issues.<BR>
<BR>
CDT is a non-profit 501(c)(3), public interest organization supported by
individuals, foundations, and a broad cross section of the computer and
communications industry. <BR>
<A NAME="agenda"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3><STRONG>CDT's 1996 Agenda</STRONG></H3>
The Center's 1996 agenda is ambitious, including several new projects. Highlights
include: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Constitutional Challenge To Online Indecency Restrictions:</STRONG>
CDT, along with the American Library Association, America Online, People
for the American Way, representatives from CDT's Interactive Working Group
(IWG), and others, filed a lawsuit in mid-February challenging the constitutionality
of the content regulations imposed on interactive communications media in
the recently enacted Telecommunications Reform Act. Filed under an expedited
appeal process, the lawsuit will reach the Supreme Court and is likely to
establish the First Amendment legal doctrine for the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
Because of its critical importance, CDT, together with AOL and ALA, organized
the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) made up of 37 organizations
and users of the Internet to take part in the litigation and educate the
judiciary about the nature of the Internet. The CIEC lawsuit highlights
the distinct nature of interactive media, and argues that the First Amendment
policy regime designed for broadcast mass media, when applied to the Internet,
is unconstitutionally restrictive given the tremendous user control inherent
in interactive communications technologies. CDT is working with Jenner and
Block's Bruce Ennis, lead attorney in the litigation, to develop the constitutional
challenge to the indecency restrictions. CDT is also organizing expert testimony
and technical expertise for the litigation to establish the ready availability
of user control technologies on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>IWG Projects On User Empowerment And Vicarious Liability:</STRONG>
The Interactive Working Group is working to educate the communications industry,
Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Administration
on the adoption and implementation of PICS (Platform For Internet Content
Selection) and other user control technologies as an alternative to content
regulations. CDT staff serves on the PICS Steering Committee. <BR>
<BR>
The IWG, which includes representatives from both the online services and
content providers, will also serve as a forum to address liability issues
in the context of the debate over intellectual property law.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Developing An Alternative National Cryptography Policy That
Works Globally: </STRONG>The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group
(DPSWG) will develop recommendations for a comprehensive alternative national
cryptography policy. The DPSWG will emphasize the immediate need for the
elimination of cryptography export restrictions, and press for policy and
market solutions that protect free speech and privacy, and ensure network
security and competitiveness in the Global Information Infrastructure. <BR>
<BR>
In the spring of 1996, the DPSWG will mount a high visibility public education
campaign, including open hearings in California and Washington DC, to inform
the public and members of Congress about the pressing need for an alternative
cryptography policy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Creating A Marketplace For Privacy In Interactive Media: </STRONG>The
Privacy Forum, a consortium of industry representatives and public interest
and consumer advocacy organizations, is working to develop policy options
and workable standards to empower individuals to exert more control over
the disclosure of personal transactional information, and to create a 
&quot;market&quot;
for privacy enhancing applications.<BR>
<BR>
In an effort to promote the development of privacy solutions, CDT will utilize
our popular World Wide Web site to demonstrate the extent of personal transactional
information generated in the course of browsing our site. The demonstration
will also highlight potential mechanisms to enhance individual control over
the collection of personal information. CDT will create an online privacy
resource center to showcase government recommendations and policies, existing
privacy policies in use by online services and content providers, and related
research and scholarship. Through its resource center and demonstration
site, CDT hopes to facilitate a public discussion towards identifying and
developing various models for enhancing privacy and individual choice online.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Encouraging Affordable, Nation Wide, High-Speed Access To The
Internet:</STRONG> CDT will organize the Digital Access Coalition (DAC),
comprised of commerce, education, and library groups, together with small
businesses and high technology industry leaders, to make the case for rapid
ISDN deployment under affordable pricing structures.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Establishing Basic Free Expression And Privacy Rights For The
Global Internet Community:</STRONG> CDT is launching a World Internet Freedom
Project (WIF), to establish awareness for the need for basic free expression
and privacy rights for Internet users around the world. Working with the
Soros Foundation, human rights organizations, online service providers,
and content providers, the WIF will seek workable solutions to the increasingly
aggressive efforts of foreign governments to regulate online communications.

</H3>
<H3>CDT's Key Accomplishments In 1995</H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Advocating a New Policy Framework For The Internet And Interactive
Media Based On First Amendment Principles: </STRONG>In 1995, CDT established
the Interactive Working Group (IWG), an ad hoc coalition of over 85 public
interest organizations and communications companies. Recognizing the unique
nature of the Internet to foster individual control over content and the
free flow of information, the IWG works to develop practical policy options
to government content regulations.<BR>
<BR>
The IWG played a critical role in urging Congress to extend constitutional
First Amendment principles applicable to print media to the Internet, opposing
legislative attempts to impose content regulations on the Internet and commercial
online services (e.g., the Exon/Coats &quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;).
Although indecency restrictions were included in the Telecommunications
Reform Act, CDT and the IWG laid the foundation for mounting a challenge
to the constitutionality of the restrictions. The IWG successfully fought
to limit vicarious liability for online service providers who merely transmit
materials created by their subscribers. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Advancing Communications Privacy And Network Security:</STRONG>
CDT's Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG), a coalition of
over 50 public interest organizations and representatives from the computer
and communications industries, is a leading voice in the effort to develop
a cryptography policy based on core First Amendment and privacy principles,
which ensures network security and competitiveness in the Global Information
Infrastructure. <BR>
<BR>
In a November 1995 letter to Vice President Gore, over 40 DPSWG members
criticized the Clinton Administration's latest cryptography policy proposal.
The DPSWG pledged to undertake a comprehensive fact finding and information
sharing process to develop an alternative cryptography policy that works
globally.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Exploring Policies To Protect The Privacy Of Personal Online
Transactional Information:</STRONG> CDT's Privacy Forum, a consortium of
public interest organizations and leading corporations working to address
information privacy issues, is engaged in a process to develop comprehensive
guidelines to protect the privacy of personal transactional data. <BR>
<BR>
Re-examining Policies Underlying Disclosure of Personal Information from
Public Records: In 1995, CDT's Privacy Forum completed its examination of
the existing policies underlying public records laws, culminating in a full-day
consultation attended by over 50 representatives from First Amendment and
privacy organizations, and information, communications and computer industries.
The increased ability to collect, store and transmit data in digital media
raise new wrinkles for rules governing public records. The consultation
focused on the heightening tension between the private sector's need for
access to public records and the growing privacy concerns over disclosure
of personal information in the interactive, digital, information environment.
A Forum-commissioned &quot;white paper&quot; served as the foundation for
the consultation. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Grass-Roots Organizing And Public Education: </STRONG>CDT is
pioneering the use of the Internet to conduct unique and effective grass-roots
public education campaigns. CDT's online organizing efforts have helped
to establish an informed, active constituency on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
As part of CDT's yearlong online campaign against the &quot;Communications
Decency Act,&quot; over 115,000 Internet users signed an online petition
in support of Senator Leahy's alternative legislative proposal. CDT organized
a National Day of Protest on December 12, 1995, which generated over 20,000
phone calls, faxes, and email messages to Congress in opposition to the
online 'indecency' regulations. CDT also spearheaded the &quot;Black Thursday
Protest&quot; during which nearly 2000 World Wide Web pages were turned
black to illustrate the far reaching impact of the 'indecency' provisions
for 48 hours after President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Reform
Act into law.<BR>
<BR>
CDT's World Wide Web site was rated among the top 5% of sites on the Web
by Point Survey; &quot;Best of the Web&quot; by 2ask Survey; and received
3 out of 4 stars from NetGuide Magazine. CDT's site is widely recognized
as the leading source for information on public policy issues affecting
civil liberties online. <A NAME="IWG"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Interactive Working Group </H3>
CDT's Interactive Working Group (IWG) is an ad hoc coalition of over 85
public interest organizations and communications companies dedicated to
developing practical policy options that support the free flow of information
on the Internet and other interactive communications media. The IWG seeks
to develop public policy solutions that recognize the unique characteristics
of interactive media, including its global reach, unlimited publishing capacity,
and enhanced user control.<BR>
<BR>
In 1995, the IWG worked to develop a constitutional, practical policy alternatives
to Congressional efforts to impose content regulations on the Internet and
commercial online information services, such as the Exon/Coats Communications
Decency Act. Towards this end, the IWG worked closely with Representatives
Chris Cox (R-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Rick White (R-WA), along with Senator
Patrick Leahy (D-VT), to develop and build support for alternative legislation
that would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from imposing
content regulations on interactive media and remove vicarious liability
for online service providers.<A NAME="IWG_activities"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>1996 IWG Activities</H3>
The IWG has an ambitious agenda planned for 1996. Activities include: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Constitutional Challenge To Online Indecency Restrictions:</STRONG>
CDT, along with the American Library Association, America Online, People
for the American Way, representatives from CDT's Interactive Working Group
(IWG), and others, filed a lawsuit in mid-February challenging the constitutionality
of the content regulations imposed on interactive communications media in
the recently enacted Telecommunications Reform Act. Filed under an expedited
appeal process, the lawsuit will reach the Supreme Court and is likely to
establish the First Amendment legal doctrine for the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
Because of its critical importance, CDT, together with AOL and ALA, has
organized the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) made up of
37 organizations and users of the Internet to take part in the litigation
and educate the judiciary about the nature of the Internet. The CIEC lawsuit
highlights the distinct nature of interactive media, and argues that the
First Amendment policy regime designed for broadcast mass media, when applied
to the Internet, is unconstitutionally restrictive given the tremendous
user control inherent in interactive communications technologies. <BR>
<BR>
CDT is working with Jenner and Block's Bruce Ennis, lead attorney in the
litigation, to develop the constitutional challenge to the indecency restrictions.
CDT is also organizing expert testimony and technical expertise for the
litigation to establish the ready availability of user control technologies
on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>IWG Project On User Empowerment:</STRONG> The Interactive Working
Group will work to educate the communications industry, Congress, the FCC,
and the Administration on the adoption and implementation of PICS (Platform
For Internet Content Selection) and other user control technologies as an
alternative to content regulations. CDT believes that blocking, filtering
and rating server standards being developed through the PICS process present
a compelling case that the least restrictive means to protect children from
harmful material is through such parental-controlled blocking, not intrusive,
bureaucratic and unconstitutional government censorship. CDT is on the Steering
Committee of PICS.<BR>
<BR>
The IWG, which includes representatives from both the online service provider
and content provider industries, will also serve as a forum to address liability
issues in the context of the debate over intellectual property law.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Access Provider Liability Policy Development And Research:</STRONG>
Excessive imposition of vicarious liability on Internet access providers
threatens to stifle the free flow of information and is contrary to constitutional
free speech and privacy principles. Yet, in areas such as defamation and
intellectual property rights, the law is evolving toward dangerous imposition
of liability on access providers. Though CDT has no desire to overturn basic
intellectual property protection, or to prevent proper recovery under tort
law, we believe that such imposition of liability threatens the core of
the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
CDT will undertake basic research and exploration of policy alternatives
in order to identify possible policies which provide clear and appropriate
legal frameworks for the operation of access providers. This research will
involve consultation with IWG participants supported by legal and policy
background papers prepared by CDT staff.<A NAME="IWG_accomp"></A>

<H3>1995 IWG Accomplishments:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Advocating A New Policy Framework For The Internet And Interactive
Media Based On First Amendment Principles:</STRONG> The IWG worked to develop
constitutional, practical policy options to government content regulations
that recognized the unique nature of the Internet to foster individual control
over content and the free flow of information. <BR>
<BR>
The IWG played a critical role in the debate over Congressional attempts
to impose unconstitutional content regulations on the Internet and commercial
online services (e.g., the Exon/Coats &quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;).
In addition to urging Congress to extend constitutional First Amendment
principles applicable to print media onto the Internet, the IWG successfully
fought to limit vicarious liability for online service providers who merely
transmit materials created by their subscribers. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Working Group Report on Technology and Policy Alternatives for
Interactive Media:</STRONG> IWG produced a comprehensive report on the case
for a policy framework for interactive media based on the democratic values
of freedom of speech and the free flow of information, including a overview
on the availability of user control technology, the state of current law,
and the legal and policy issues raised by legislative efforts to impose
content regulations on interactive media. The study was distributed to members
of Congress and the press in July, 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Demonstration of User Empowerment Technologies:</STRONG> IWG
educated public and government officials on the availability of less restrictive
alternatives to government content regulations, including user control technologies.
IWG, working with the Interactive Services Association (ISA), presented
a technological demonstration for members of Congress, their staff, and
the press of user control technologies by America Online, Prodigy, SurfWatch,
Netscape and Webster Network Strategies on July 17, 1995. The demonstration
was instrumental in making the case for the Cox/Wyden approach, and received
considerable press attention nationwide.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Public Education, Grass-Roots Activism in Support of IWG Goals:</STRONG>
CDT undertook a massive Internet based grass-roots public education campaign,
including an online petition drive which yielded over 115,000 signatures
in opposition to government-imposed content regulations and in support of
the Cox/Wyden/White amendment. CDT's online organizing efforts helped draw
public and media attention to the issue. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Publications:</STRONG> CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman and
Deputy Director Daniel Weitzner's article Abundance and User Control: Renewing
the Democratic Heart of the First Amendment in the Age of Interactive Media,
was published in the Yale Law Journal in May, 1995. The article makes the
case for a high level of First Amendment protection for interactive media.
<A NAME="DPSWG"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group</H3>
CDT's Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) is a coalition
of over 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations working
to develop and implement policies that protect privacy and network security
on the Global Information Infrastructure. <BR>
<BR>
Originally formed in 1986, the DPSWG has played a critical role on several
major privacy issues, including the drafting of the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act (ECPA), the 1994 defeat of the Clinton Administration's Clipper
Chip government key escrow encryption plan, and the crafting of a narrowly
tailored &quot;Digital Telephony&quot; legislation with strong public accountability
mechanisms and privacy protections.<A NAME="DPSWG_projects"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>1996 DPSWG Projects: </H3>
In 1996, DPSWG is continuing to play a central role in the increasingly
visible national debate over cryptography policy. DPSWG is also monitoring
the implementation of the &quot;Digital Telephony&quot; legislation (the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act) and providing a forum
for discussing other issues relating to information privacy and security
on the GII.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>The DPSWG Cryptography Policy Project:</STRONG> DPSWG is developing
recommendations for an alternative national cryptography policy that will
provide strong privacy and security for users and meets the demands of a
competitive global marketplace. Following through on the commitment made
in its November, 1995 letter to Vice President Gore, DPSWG will hold a series
of forums, and engage in a broad public education campaign about the need
for widely available strong cryptography on the GII. Activities for 1996
include:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Briefing for the American People:</STRONG> This Spring, the
DPSWG will host a &quot;Briefing for the American People&quot; focusing
on the need for a comprehensive national cryptography policy. This high
visibility event, which will include presentations from industry leaders,
cryptography experts, and public interest advocates, will launch DPSWG's
public education campaign.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>DPSWG Cryptography Summit:</STRONG> This Summer, DPSWG will
bring together leading experts from across industry and the public interest
community for a Cryptography Policy Summit, to exchange ideas on the direction
of cryptography policy and develop a strategy for providing better privacy
and security on the GII.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>White Paper on Encryption Policy:</STRONG> In Fall 1996, DPSWG
will release &quot;A White Paper on Encryption: The Case for a Comprehensive
Cryptography Policy,&quot; summarizing the findings of the DPSWG Summit
and presentations made at the March &quot;Briefing for the American People.&quot;
The &quot;White Paper&quot; will serve as the basis for DPSWG's recommendations
for an alternative cryptography policy.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Legislative Activities:</STRONG> As Congress considers legislation
to address the lack of a comprehensive national cryptography policy, DPSWG
stands ready to play a leading role in the process to ensure that the principles
of free speech and privacy, as well as network security and competitiveness
on the GII, are addressed.<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public Accountability over FBI Electronic Surveillance 
Authority:</STRONG>
The DPSWG is closely monitoring the implementation of the 1994 Communications
Assistance For Law Enforcement Act to ensure that The Act's public accountability
mechanisms are fully utilized and its new privacy protections are strictly
enforced. DPSWG is leading the effort to ensure that the FBI provides historical
justification for its proposed surveillance capacity request, and is working
with Senator Leahy (D-VT) and other concerned members of Congress to ensure
that the public is able to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's request
before funding to implement the requirements is appropriated. <A 
NAME="DPSWG_activities"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>1995 DPSWG Activities: </H3>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Developing an Alternative National Cryptography Policy:</STRONG>
Throughout 1995, DPSWG worked to mobilize the public interest community
and the computer and communications industry towards developing an alternative
national cryptography policy that satisfies the need for individual privacy
and network security, and will meet the demands of a competitive global
marketplace. <BR>
<BR>
Towards this end, in November 1995, over 40 DPSWG members, companies, trade
associations, and public interest groups wrote to Vice President Gore criticizing
the Administration's current approach to cryptography policy. The coalition
pledged to undertake a process to develop recommendations for a more comprehensive
cryptography policy to be presented to the Administration, Congress, and
the public this year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Ensuring Public Accountability over FBI Electronic Surveillance
Ability:</STRONG> In 1995, DPSWG also worked to ensure public accountability
over FBI electronic surveillance ability granted under the Communications
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). Public accountability is essential
in protecting privacy and ensuring reasonable cost recovery. In October,
1995, the FBI announced its first proposed surveillance capacity requirements
notice, as required by CALEA. DPSWG members, in their comments on the FBI's
notice, all stressed the importance of public accountability and disclosure
of the basis for the FBI's request. <A NAME="privacy_forum"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Privacy Forum</H3>
CDT's Privacy Forum is a consortium of public interest organizations and
leading corporations working to identify ways to enhance privacy, individual
choice, and the free flow of information on the global information infrastructure
(GII). The Forum's 1996/1997 mission is to identify existing policies and
explore the development of new policies that encourage technological developments
that advance privacy and facilitate the implementation of basic fair information
practices on the Internet and other interactive communications media. <BR>
<BR>
Through a collaborative process of exploration and discussion, the Forum
will seek to educate its members and the public on the privacy landscape
in interactive media. The Forum will begin by developing a record of existing
policies and technological mechanisms that protect privacy and encourage
individual participation in new communications media. From this factual
basis, the Forum will seek to identify and develop model policies that import
fair information practices applied in other media into the interactive world.
Committed to the principle of extending fair information practices to interactive
media, the Forum intends to explore how to apply traditional fair information
practices in light of the unique characteristics of interactive communications
media.<A NAME="privacy_forum_act"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>The Privacy Forum's 1996 Activities: </H3>
The focus of the Privacy Forum's 1996 activities is the privacy of transactional
information generated during users' interactions on the Internet and commercial
online services. A number of online service and content providers have begun
to independently grapple with the privacy ramifications of online activities.
However, transactional privacy has not been a key focus of attention for
the Internet as a whole. As the use of interactive communications technologies
continues to expand, the need for coherent privacy policies and applications
is becoming increasingly clear. <BR>
<BR>
Recognizing that uncertainty about the policies regarding the privacy of
personal information will undermine the public's desire to fully participate
in social, political, and commercial activities online, the Privacy Forum
is working to identify and address key transactional privacy issues. <BR>
<BR>
CDT seeks to advance individual privacy by encouraging the adoption of policies
that enhance the capacity to exercise meaningful choice over the disclosure
and use of personal information, and by collaborating with software developers
and online services and content providers to explore the possibility of
designing and implementing technological mechanisms towards these ends.
Through public education, policy expertise, and informed dialogue, CDT hopes
to facilitate a public discussion towards creating a marketplace for privacy
and individual choice online.<BR>
<BR>
The Forum is establishing a Steering Committee on Transactional Privacy
to guide its work in this endeavor. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Creating a Record of Privacy Policies and Promising 
Technologies:</STRONG>
Foremost on the Forum's agenda is the creation of a factual, public record
on transactional information privacy. Before the Forum can develop strategies
for advancing individual privacy and control over personal information,
it must first educate its members and the public as to the existing privacy
policies, the technological capacity of the systems under consideration,
and the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps of each.<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Privacy Policy Clearinghouse:</STRONG> CDT, on behalf of the
Privacy Forum, is soliciting privacy policies from: online service providers;
commercial sites, political sites, non-profit sites and personal sites on
the World Wide Web; Usenet; private and public Internet providers; traditional
telecommunications carriers; and cable companies. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Analysis of State Activities:</STRONG> The Privacy Forum will
work closely with a leading expert in privacy issues and online activities
to review and comment upon activities at the state level, including pending
legislative proposals and regulatory activity. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Analysis of the European Union's Data Protection Directive:</STRONG>
The Forum, in collaboration with a leading privacy expert, will review the
European Union's Data Protection Directive and U.S. privacy laws to examine
the current policies and practices governing the generation, collection,
and use of personal transactional information online. CDT is participating
with Privacy &amp; American Business' Global Privacy Policies Project to
foster the implementation of policies consistent with the recent mandate
of the Directive. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Technology Review:</STRONG> Through a series of technology
demonstrations, the Privacy Forum will create a record of existing technological
mechanisms that encourage user control over the flow of information.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Privacy Forum Compendium on Transactional Privacy:</STRONG>
The Forum will publish the product of its public education efforts in a
compendium on transactional privacy. The review will be made available in
both paper form and electronically via CDT's World Wide Web Privacy Demonstration
Site. 
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Developing Models for Fair Information Practices in the Online
Environment:</STRONG> Through an intensive and inclusive process of investigation
and discussion, the Forum seeks to identify and develop model policies and
technological mechanisms that translate fair information practices for the
online world. The Forum will use its Compendium on Transactional Privacy
as the starting point. A series of public consultations, policy briefings,
technology demonstrations and one-on-one meetings between CDT staff and
Forum members will inform the Forum's process. The proceedings of all Forum
activities will be summarized, annotated, and made publicly available as
a single volume.<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Consultations:</STRONG> The Privacy Forum will hold three
consultations in 1996 and 1997 on transactional privacy. Consultations will
be open to the public and effort will be made to attract a wide cross section
of the public interest community, online service providers, software developers,
and individuals who maintain sites on the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
    <UL>
    <LI><STRONG>First Consultation:</STRONG> At its first consultation,
to be held in April, 1996, the Forum will present the product of its search
for existing privacy policies in interactive communications media. The Consultation
will be the focus of a productive, factually based discussion of existing
policies. The goals of the Consultation will be to compare and contrast
existing policies, where possible to identify &quot;best policies,&quot;
to create a record of significant gaps in approaches and policies, and to
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing policies.<BR>
<BR>
    <LI><STRONG>Second Consultation:</STRONG> The Forum's second consultation
will highlight policies that advance individual privacy, choice and the
free flow of information through technological mechanisms that take advantage
of the unique characteristics of interactive media. Building upon the &quot;best
policies&quot; identified during the first consultation, the Forum will
seek to establish Fair Information Models for use in the online environment.
Two White Papers, one prepared by CDT in collaboration with the Institute
for Public Representation, and another by the Interactive Services Association
presenting models for enhancing privacy and choice online, will serve as
additional background for the consultation.<BR>
<BR>
    <LI><STRONG>Third Consultation:</STRONG> The third consultation will
focus on implementation issues surrounding fair information practices and
privacy policies. The growing number of intermediaries and the distributed
nature of interactive communications media, raises new wrinkles for applying
fair information and privacy policies. For example, it is unclear who is
responsible for notifying a user of policies, how agreements are passed
on to those involved in a transaction, and who is responsible for breaches
of policy. The third consultation will seek to identify and explore these
issues. <BR>
<BR>
    </UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Technology Demonstrations and Briefings:</STRONG> Unique 
characteristics
of interactive communications media such as increased user control, real-time
communication, and ease of individualizing systems, have the potential to
enhance individual privacy through increased control over the disclosure,
generation, collection and use of personal information. Through timely 
demonstrations
and briefings, the Forum will seek to keep its members and the public up-to-date
on new developments within the privacy field as well as those in other areas
that may be adapted to advance fair information practices and privacy. <BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public Education - Interactive World Wide Web Privacy 
Demonstration:</STRONG>
CDT is creating a demonstration project to make visible the extent of personally
revealing transactional information generated by individuals in the normal
course of browsing CDT's site. The demonstration will serve to illustrate
the extent of information that may be revealed to CDT, as well as third
parties, and potential ways to facilitate individual control over the collection
of such information.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Public Dialogue:</STRONG> CDT is continuing to engage in constructive
dialogue with others interested in advancing privacy in interactive communications
media. CDT is continuing to work closely with the Federal Trade Commission
on its Privacy Initiative and with the NTIA as it attempts to apply its
Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information to various sectors.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Scholarship:</STRONG> CDT staff will complete and seek to publish
an article on Privacy in the Interactive Age.<A NAME="PF_transact"></A>

<H3>The Privacy Forum's 1995 Transactional Privacy Activities</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The Forum's 1995 activities created a foundation on which to launch
a collaborative dialogue between the public and private sector for exploring
transactional privacy issues in interactive media. <STRONG>On December 12,
1995, the Forum held its first Policy and Technology Briefing to explore
transactional privacy issues.</STRONG> Participants in the December Briefing
raised a number of critical points that will inform our future activities:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Advances in technology increase the magnitude of risk to individual
privacy.</STRONG> Shabbir Safdar of Voters Telecommunications Watch, noted
that numerous entities touch information flowing between any two points
on the Internet and each entity has the potential ability to capture, store
and reuse transactional data. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Questions regarding the generation, storage, and use of personal
transactional data.</STRONG> While there was consensus that the distinction
between the content of a communication and the transaction data generated
by that communication is blurring, the policy direction this observation
takes us in is unclear. One participant noted that the recently enacted
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Pub. Law 103-414, October
1994), with its increased legal barriers to government access to transaction
data, signals that the private sector's use of this data is likely to come
under increased scrutiny. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Private sector and non-profit users of the Internet share
a deep commitment to protecting privacy.</STRONG> Clear rules are seen as
essential to building strong consumer trust and confidence. However, Link
Hoewing, from Bell Atlantic, and others cautioned that privacy policies
already in place in the telecommunications arena may not easily translate
into interactive environments, and that the fragmented, ad hoc policies
that regulate various industries differently are raising sticky problems
as media applications continue to converge, blurring what were once meaningful
distinctions. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Executive branch and other activities are increasing the urgency
with which privacy issues posed by interactive media must be addressed.</STRONG>
In 1995, the Federal Trade Commission launched a Privacy Initiative designed
to protect consumers in the emerging high-tech, global marketplace; the
NTIA released a report that concluded the private sector must implement
privacy standards or face a legislative mandate (the privacy equivalent
of Senator Exon's online indecency bill); the European Union finalized its
data protection directive which threatens to impede the flow of personal
information across national borders if adequate privacy standards and enforcement
mechanisms are not in place.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Interactive media offer enormous potential to advance privacy
interests by empowering people to exert greater control over their personal
information.</STRONG> As Jerry Berman of CDT pointed out, many of the recently
developed filtering devices that enable individuals to control information
they receive, offer a potentially powerful model for empowering users to
exercise increased control over personal information they disclose. In this
context, privacy interests must develop consistent with the free flow of
information and other fundamental interests. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>Interactive Media can facilitate greater user control over
personally identifiable information online.</STRONG> Echoing a recent NTIA
report, Janlori Goldman of CDT concluded that interactivity may make possible
greater individual participation in personal information choices, however
a collaborative exploration of the full range of policy and technical options
is needed to seek solutions. 
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Re-examining Policies Underlying Disclosure of Personal Information
from Public Records:</STRONG> In 1995, CDT's Privacy Forum completed its
examination of the existing policies underlying public records laws, culminating
in a full-day consultation attended by over 50 representatives from First
Amendment and privacy organizations, and information, communications and
computer industries. The increased ability to collect, store and transmit
data in digital media raise new wrinkles for rules governing public records.
The consultation focused on the heightening tension between the private
sector's need for access to public records and the growing privacy concerns
over disclosure of personal information in the interactive, digital, information
environment. A Forum-commissioned &quot;white paper&quot; served as the
foundation for the consultation. <A NAME="DAC"></A>
</UL>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>Digital Access Coalition</H3>
CDT is launching the Digital Access Coalition (DAC) in order to promote
affordable, nation-wide, high speed digital access to the Internet through
reasonable-priced ISDN service. The DAC will assemble a coalition of consumer,
education and library groups, together with small business and high technology
market leaders, to make the case for the necessity of rapid ISDN deployment
and feasibility of reasonable pricing structures.<BR>
<BR>
In recent years, ISDN has overcome its image as &quot;too little, too late&quot;
because of the availability of affordable Terminal Adapters, the success
of multimedia, PC-based computing, the World Wide Web, and the evident delays
in deploying true broadband services through either telecommunications or
cable networks. Indeed, ISDN has the potential to succeed as a mass market
communications service that offers affordable access to multimedia applications
such as the World Wide Web, advanced commercial online services, and a range
of video conferencing and telecommuting services. Such applications promise
tremendous benefit for education, library and other community-based applications,
and are certain to be a boon for small business in rural areas. Yet, ISDN
tariffs around the country are either non-existent or priced prohibitively
high. ISDN cannot bring benefits to the mass market if the service is priced
beyond mass-market levels. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public/Private Coalition:</STRONG> The DAC plans to bring together
all who stand to benefit from widely available, affordable ISDN service
in order to advocate for reasonably-priced offering. Such a coalition --
including schools, libraries, small businesses, community economic development
groups, and large and small high-tech multimedia firms -- represent a powerful
force for stating the need for ISDN. With strong ties to the consumer movement
and the high technology sector, CDT is uniquely positioned to build such
a coalition. 
</UL>
<STRONG>DAC Activities:</STRONG> With a commitment to pool resources from
key DAC participants, the Working Group could commence work immediately
on the following activities: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Outreach:</STRONG> Invite interested parties from the public
and private sector to join the DAC efforts.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Policy Paper and Model Tariff Development:</STRONG> The keystone
of the DAC's advocacy effort should be a policy paper presenting the case
for affordable ISDN and economic analyses that demonstrate that low-price
tariffs are economically reasonable. Such a paper will give DAC members
a common message and provide Public Service Commissions a rationale for
progressive tariffing decisions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Coordination with FCC ISDN Activities:</STRONG> The Federal
Communications Commission has shown a keen interest in promoting affordable
ISDN around the country. Thus, the DAC has an opportunity to work with the
Commission to help promote ISDN awareness.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Public Education:</STRONG> Promoting awareness of the value
of ISDN in the popular and trade press will be an essential component of
DAC activities.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Consultation with Local Telephone Companies:</STRONG> At least
some of the Regional Bell companies have a genuine interest in promoting
ISDN at mass market pricing. Moreover, these companies have expressed an
interest in developing consensus pricing approaches that satisfy the needs
of consumers and avoid unproductive, costly regulatory battles. 
</UL>
<STRONG>Track Record of the DAC and CDT:</STRONG> The DAC is a re-casting
of the original Open Platform<BR>
Working Group (OPWG), which first came together to promote affordable ISDN
pricing in 1992. OPWG coalition efforts resulted in the Open Platform services
sector of the 1994 Telecommunications Reform bill, which empowered the FCC
to promote and encourage reasonably priced ISDN service at the state level.
CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman and Deputy Director Daniel Weitzner,
both of whom were at the Electronic Frontier Foundation at the time, led
the Open Platform effort both in the U.S. Congress, and in several states
that now have reasonably priced ISDN service, such as Massachusetts, Tennessee
and California.<A NAME="WIF"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>World Internet Freedom Project</H3>
CDT is launching the World Internet Freedom Project (WIF) in Spring 1996.
The goal of the WIF is to establish awareness of the need for basic free
expression and privacy rights for Internet users around the world. As the
Internet grows, it has the potential to increase democratic political participation,
as well as to bring the economic opportunities of the Information Age to
communities around the world. Yet, neither the political nor economic potential
of the Internet will be realized unless basic free expression, free association,
free flow of information, and privacy rights are established and protected
internationally. <BR>
<BR>
In the last year alone, threats to free expression, free association, and
basic privacy of communications have mushroomed. Yet, there is no coordinated
international effort to enable individual rights advocates to mount a concerted
response to these threats. WIF will be a clearinghouse and organizing base
for public education and coalition-building in support of the political
and economic vitality of the Internet worldwide. <BR>
<BR>
The WIF will address the following critical issues: free expression and
the legal censorship regimes in individual countries as well as the impact
of local censorship on the Internet as a whole; free association and anonymity;
communications privacy and encryption; government interference with the
design of telecommunications networks; the lack of uniform, international
communications privacy protections; and cultural segregation that pose a
threat to the free flow of information globally. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Planning Phase:</STRONG> The planning phase for WIF is funded by
an initial grant from the Soros Foundation. Through this phase, CDT will
identify partners around the world who are committed to advancing democratic
values on the Internet. A small conference of key parties will be held in
the spring, 1996. From this conference, CDT will establish an international
advisory committee of activists and other leaders to guide the work of WIF.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Full Scale Operation:</STRONG> CDT is currently seeking funding
for the full scale operation of WIF that will include issue research, and
information collection and dissemination. Towards this end, proposed legislation,
relevant statutes, treaties, and other legal material would be made available
online on the World Wide Web. CDT will establish the WIF as a liaison between
international governments and non-governmental organizations. Further, the
WIF will serve as a presence in international bodies, and engage in public
education efforts aimed at the international press.<A NAME="special"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>CDT Special Projects</H3>
In addition to coordinating public policy working groups and advancing our
own positions on critical free speech and privacy issues, CDT conducts research
and advocacy on several other important civil liberties issues, including:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Health Information Privacy:</STRONG> CDT is committed to enhancing
and preserving information privacy during the transformation to a health
information infrastructure. CDT is working to ensure that strong, enforceable
privacy policy is in place to guide the design and implementation of health
information systems.<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>National Policy:</STRONG> In October, 1995, Senators Bennett
(R-UT) and Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Medical Records Confidentiality Act
(S.1360). The introduction of S.1360, the strongest and most comprehensive
health privacy legislation ever considered by Congress, is a key milestone
in CDT's effort to press for a policy that protects the privacy of personal
health information. <BR>
<BR>
In November, 1995, CDT testified in support of S.1360 before the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources. The Senate plans to take action
on the bill in spring, 1996. CDT has been asked to testify in March, 1996
on a similar House measure. <BR>
<BR>
A CDT-initiated working group of civil liberties and patients' rights groups,
along<BR>
with representatives of the health, information, and communications industry,
will continue to press for the strongest, most effective health information
privacy policy. Georgetown Law School's Federal Legislation Clinic is providing
CDT with legal assistance in this activity. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>State Health Information Systems:</STRONG> CDT continues its
hands-on involvement with a number of Community Health Information Systems
sites (CHMIS). With the support of the Hartford Foundation and the Foundation
for Health Care Quality, CDT provides policy and technology expertise to
the CHMIS sites on privacy, confidentiality and security issues. The Center's
work with the CHMIS sites includes assisting state legislative efforts to
protect privacy, participating in policy discussions regarding access and
use of personal health information, and recommending appropriate policies
and technologies for health information systems. During 1996, CDT will complete
a &quot;Privacy Manual&quot; providing policy recommendations to the CHMIS
sites, and a set of educational materials designed to empower citizens to
better protect the privacy of their health records for use by civil liberties,
patients' rights, and consumer groups in grass-roots educational activities.
<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Public Access to Government Information -- E-FOIA:</STRONG>
CDT has been working with congressional staff, the Clinton Administration,
press, and open government advocates to develop a revised version of the
Electronic Freedom of Information Act amendments that passed the Senate
in the 103rd Congress.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Online Publications and Resources:</STRONG> Our very popular
Web site is a key spot on the Internet for information on civil liberties
in cyberspace (See URL:http://www.cdt.org). CDT's World Wide Web site was
rated among the top 5% of sites on the Web by Point Survey; &quot;Best of
the Web&quot; by 2ask Survey; and received 3 out of 4 stars from NetGuide
Magazine. The site is widely recognized as the leading source for information
on public policy issues affecting civil liberties online. In addition, our
regular online publication, the CDT Policy Post, has a direct circulation
of 9,000, and is read by thousands more on Usenet newsgroups and our online
archives. <A NAME="staff"></A>
