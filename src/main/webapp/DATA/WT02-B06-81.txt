<P><CENTER><B>VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY<BR>
President Signs Executive Order Transferring Jurisdiction of Encryption
Technology</B></CENTER>

<P>WASHINGTON -- Vice President Gore today (11/15) announced that President
Clinton has taken two significant actions to implement the encryption export
liberalization plan announced in October.<BR>
<BR>

First, President Clinton has signed an executive order directing the transfer
of jurisdiction for the export control of commercial encryption products
from the State Department to the Commerce Department. Second, President
Clinton has designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography.<BR>
<BR>

&quot;We are moving forward to implement the encryption export liberalization
plan that I announced in October,&quot; said Vice President Gore. &quot;These
two actions will help to promote the growth of international electronic
commerce and robust secure global communications in a manner that protects
the public safety and our national security.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

On October 1, 1996, Vice President Gore announced an Administration plan
to make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products -- whether
at home or abroad -- to protect their privacy, intellectual property and
other valuable information. The plan comprises a comprehensive set of actions
to promote the development of key recovery products and an encryption key
management infrastructure. Specifically, it allows the export of 56-bit
key length encryption products under a general license contingent upon industry
commitments to build and market future products that support key recovery.
It also called for transferring jurisdiction for controlling the export
of commercial encryption technology from the State Department to the Commerce
Department.<BR>
<BR>

Key recovery presumes that a trusted party (such as a bank or, in some cases,
a party internal to the user's organization) could recover a confidentiality
key to the encrypted data for the user or for law enforcement officials
acting under proper court authority.<BR>
<BR>

The Executive Order, &quot;Administration of Export Control on Encryption
Products,&quot; and a Presidential Memorandum on Encryption Export Policy,
signed by President Clinton today, directs the transfer of jurisdiction
for the export control of commercial encryption products from the State
Department to the Commerce Department. The transfer becomes effective upon
promulgation of regulations by the Commerce Department, expected before
the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>

This action subjects licensing application decisions to strict time lines
for governmental response, while providing for interagency consultation
on those decisions. Under the executive order, concerned agencies will have
the opportunity to participate in Commerce Department licensing decisions.
No agency will have a veto over decisions to export encryption products.
The computer and communications industries have called for the jurisdiction
transfer, and it was recommended in the recent report of the National Research
Council.<BR>
<BR>

Vice President Gore also announced today that President Clinton has designated
Ambassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography, with the responsibility
to promote the growth of international electronic commerce and robust, secure
global communications in a manner that protects the public safety and national
security.<BR>
<BR>

Ambassador Aaron will carry out his responsibilities as Special Envoy while
retaining his position as the United States Permanent Representative to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris.
As Special Envoy, Ambassador Aaron will promote international cooperation,
coordinate U.S. contacts with foreign governments on encryption matters
and provide a focal point for identifying and resolving bilateral and multilateral
encryption issues.<BR>
<BR>

Ambassador Aaron has served in both government and the private sector. He
has been a member of the boards of several major private sector organizations,
and served as Deputy National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter.
He has been the Permanent Representative at the OECD since 1993.<BR>
