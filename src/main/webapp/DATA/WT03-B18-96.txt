album, it is about an event which happened in South America not too long
ago.</P>

<P><A NAME="MANIFEST"></A>MANIFEST</P>

<P>Friday, October 2nd, 1992 Chaos has descended in &quot;Carandiru,&quot;
the biggest penitentiary complex in South America. Over a hundred inmates
dead and hundreds injured on the massacre. The police arrived with helicopters
and over two hundred armed forces. They took the jailblock called &quot;Pavilhao
Nove&quot; and opened fire on the inmates in a holocaust method of annihilation.
The government of the city of Sao Paulo cannot control the brutality of
its police. Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet.
The bodies were filled with bullets and bites from the police dogs. The
police try to hide the massacre saying there were only eight deaths. The
violence of Brazilian cops is very well known outside of Brazil, This kind
of extermination is a method that they use to get rid of the overpopulation
in the jails. The violence of the cops left the whole pavilion destroyed
after the rebellion.</P>

<P>BIG BROTHER WANTS TO LOOK INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT (Any Time It Pleases)</P>

<P>The US Government is constructing a system to track all financial transactions
in realtime-ostensibly to catch drug traffickers, terrorists, and financial
criminals. Does that leave you with the warm fuzzies-or scare you out of
your wits?</P>

<P>By Anthony L. Kimery ascii'ed by The P/\NTHER -TRZ/TRSI/UMF-</P>

<P>There wasn't much to go on. The Police salvaged the slip of paper that
a small time East Coast drug dealer tried to eat before being arrested,
but on it they found scribbled only a &quot;John.&quot; This frustrated
the police. They had anticipated more incriminating information on the
man they believed was the supplier not only to the dealer they'd just busted,
but also to dozens of other street corner crack peddlers.</P>

<P>With two slim leads, the police weren't technically equipped to do much
more than antiquated detective work that probably wouldn't yield evidence
they could use to indict John. So they turned to the quasi-secretive, federal
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for the digital sleuthing
they needed.</P>

<P>Less than 45 minutes after receiving the official police request for
help, FinCEN had retrieved enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing from
government databases that the district attorney prosecuting the case was
able to seek indictments against John on charges of money laundering and
conspiracy to traffic narcotics. The local police were impressed.</P>

<P>Launched with a low-key champagne reception at the Treasury Department
in April 1990, FinCEN is the US government's (perhaps the world's) most
effective financial crime investigation unit. Even Russian President Boris
Yeltsin asked for its help in locating stolen Communist Party funds. This
start-of-the-art computer-snooping agency is quietly tucked away under
the auspices of the Treasury Department. Its mission is to map the digital
trails of dirty money, be it the laundered profits from drug sales , stolen
S&amp;L, loot, hidden political slush funds, or the financing conduits
of terrorists. It's the only federal unit devoted solely to the systematic
collation and cross-analysis of law enforcement, intelligence, and public
databases.</P>

<P>Until August 1993, FinCEN headquarters was an old Social Security Administration
building with a ceiling ravaged by asbestos abatement crews, but that didn't
seem to faze director Brian Bruh (he retired in October). With 25 years
of experience in law enforcement, Bruh is a seasoned federal cop who has
headed up criminal investigations at both the IRS and the Pentagon. Prior
to overseeing FinCEN, he was the chief investigator for the Tower Commission,
President Reagan's blue ribbon probe into the Iran-Contra scandal. FinCEN
was his crowning achievement, and he took pride in directing visitors to
FinCEN's computer command center as he touted the agency's successes.</P>

<P>In private and in testimony to Congress, statistics roll off Bruh's
tongue. Last year FinCEN's computer operations center responded to priority
requests for tactical intelligence on nearly 12,000 individuals and entities,
doubling the 1991 workload. The 1995 total will be three times the 1991
sum. Longer-term strategic analytical reports have been completed for 715
investigations involving 16,000 other individuals and entities.</P>

<P>Two of the government's biggest strikes against organized drug-money
laundering-operation Green Ice (a lengthy DEA operation that resulted in
the arrests of high-ranking Cali and Medellin cartel financial officers
and the seizure of US$54 million cash and assets) and Polar Cap V (a spinoff
of Green Ice that culminated in April 1990) - owe a great deal to FinCEN
for having identified and targeted money laundering activities via computer.
In the Polar Cap operation, FinCEN's computer tracking documented more
than US$500 million in financial activity by 47 individuals who have since
been indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.</P>

<P>Inside FinCEN's new digs on the second floor of a gleaming high-rise
office building down the road from the CIA in Vienna, Virginia (otherwise
known as &quot;Spook City&quot;), the talents of the IRS, FBI, DEA, Secret
Service, and other traditional federal cops such as customs agents and
postal inspectors are pooled. According to senior intelligence officers,
these investigative units can access the resources of the CIA, the National
Security Agency (which intercepts data on electronic currency movements
into and out of the United States, some of which make their way into FinCEN's
analyses), and the Defense Intelligence Agency.</P>

<P>Bruh and other FinCEN officials openly acknowledge their association
with the CIA, but they refuse to discuss further any aspect of FinCEN's
dealings with it or any other intelligence agency. In addition to the CIA,
intelligence officials have admitted, off the record, that the National
Security Council and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and
Research (INR) have also joined FinCEN's impressive intelligence crew.
In short, FinCEN is a one-of-a-kind cauldron containing all the available
financial intelligence in the United States.</P>

<P>&quot;It's the first ever government-wide, multi-source intelligence
and analytical network brought together under one roof to combat financial
crimes,&quot; said Peter Djinis, director of the Treasury department's
Office of Financial Enforcement and one of the few Treasury officials close
to FinCEN activities.</P>

<P>&quot;FinCEN is absolutely necessary,&quot; said a senior General Accounting
Office (GAO) official involved in an audit of FinCEN required by new anti-money-laundering
laws passed last year. The agency's report wasn't released by press time,
but according to the GAO official, no irregularities were uncovered. However,
the GAO's scrutiny skirted emerging concerns about privacy, civil rights,
and the appropriate role of the intelligence community.</P>

<P>FinCEN's mission requires the involvement of the intelligence community,
particularly in tracking the financial dealings of terrorists and in conducting
financial counterintelligence, although few are willing to discuss the
trend openly. Because these activities cross into the world of cloaks and
daggers, some watchdogs are concerned that such endeavors will encroach
on -privacy and civil rights. When you look at the power of FinCEN and
its proposed offspring, their fears seem justified.</P>

<P>HOW TO BUST A JOHN</P>

<P>The whiz kids at FinCEN are good. Very good. That's why state and local
police have come to depend on FinCEN to pull them out of the electronic-sleuthing
quicksand. The case of John the drug supplier is a good example of one
of their less-complex assignments, and it illustrates the adeptness with
which the government can collate existing financial data.</P>

<P>Seated at a computer terminal inside FinCEN's former command post, a
FinCEN analyst began the hunt. He started by querying a database of business
phone numbers. He scored a hit with the number of a local restaurant. Next
he entered the Currency and Banking Database (CBDB), an IRS database accessed
through the Currency and Banking Retrieval System. CBDB contains roughly
50 million Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs), which document all financial
transactions of more than $10,000. By law these transactions must be filed
by banks, S&amp;Ls, credit unions, securities brokers, casinos, and other
individuals and businesses engaged in the exchange of large sums of money.</P>

<P>The analyst narrowed his quest by searching for CTRs filed for transactions
deemed &quot;suspicious.&quot; Financial institutions must still file a
CTR, or IRS Form 4789, if a transaction under US$10,000 is considered suspicious
under the terms of an extensive federal government list. There was a hit.
A series of &quot;suspicious&quot; CTRs existed in the restaurant's ZIP
code. Punching up images of the identified CTRs on his terminal, the FinCEN
analyst noted that the transactions were made by a person whose first name
was John. The CTRs were suspicious all right; they were submitted for a
series of transactions each in the amount of US$9,5000, just below the
CTR threshold of US$10,000. This was hard evidence that John structured
the deposits to avoid filing a Form 4789, and that is a federal crime.</P>

<P>Selecting one of the CTRs for &quot;an expanded review,&quot; the analyst
got John's full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address,
driver license number, and other vital statistics, including bank account
numbers.</P>

<P>Plunging back into the IRS database, the analyst broadened his search
for all CTRs filed on behalf of the suspect, including non-suspicious CTRs.
Only 20 reports deemed suspicious popped up on the screen, but more than
150 CTRs were filed in all. A review of the non-suspicious ones revealed
that on several, John listed his occupation as the owner or manager of
the restaurant identified by the telephone number on the slip of paper
taken from the arrested drug dealer. The connection between the name and
the phone number originally given to FinCEN was secured.</P>

<P>The FinCEN analyst then tapped commercial and government databases,
and turned up business information on the restaurant showing that John
had reported an expected annual revenue for his eatery of substantially
less than the money he had been depositing, as indicated by the CTRs. Fishing
in a database of local tax assessment records, the analyst discovered that
John owned other properties and businesses. With the names of these other
companies, the analyst went back into the CTR database and found that suspicious
transaction reports were filed on several of them as well.</P>

<P>As routine as such assignments as this case may be, the chumminess between
FinCEN and the intelligence community raises serious questions about the
privacy and security for the financial records of citizens John and Jane
Doe, considering the intelligence community's historic penchant for illegal
spying on non-criminals. Given the vast reach and ease with which the government
can now tap into an individual's or business's financial records on a whim,
these questions have received far too little scrutiny.</P>

<P>WHOSE PRIVACY? &quot;There are legitimate concerns&quot; regarding privacy,
a ranking House banking committee staffer conceded in an interview with
Wired. &quot;Quite frankly, there hasn't been much congressional oversight
with respect to the intelligence community's involvement with FinCEN. When
you start trying to look into this, you start running up against all kinds
of roadblocks.&quot; The GAO official involved in auditing FinCEN agreed
that questions regarding the intelligence community's involvement and attendant
privacy concerns haven't been addressed. If such issues have been the subject
of discussion behind the closed doors of the House and Senate intelligence
committees, no one is talking openly about it.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the potential for abusive intrusion by government into the
financial affairs of private citizens and businesses is growing almost
unnoticed and unchecked.</P>

<P>Two of the latest electronic inroads into the financial records of private
citizens and businesses are &quot;Operation Gateway,&quot; a FinCEN initiative,
and the proposed Deposit Tracking System, which other intelligence agencies
would like to see established. Both are inherently prone to abuse and provide
a disturbing indication of the direction in which the government is moving.</P>

<P>Gateway is a pilot program launched in Texas this July that gives state
and local law enforcement officials direct access to the massive federal
Financial Database (FDB) through a designated FinCEN coordinator. The FDB
contains the records that financial institutions have been filing under
the Bank Secrecy Act for the last 23 years - CTRs, suspicious transaction
reports, International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments
reports, and Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reports. In addition.
Congress is expected to grant FinCEN authority to tap into the database
of Forms 8300, which are reports of payments over US$10k000 received in
a trade or business. These documents principally contain information on
deposits, withdrawals, and the movement of large sums of currency. It is
FinCEN's intent to give all state governments individual access to the
FDB.</P>

<P>Under the Gateway proposal, results from all queries would be written
into a master audit file that will constantly be compared against other
requests and databases to track whether the subject of the inquiry is of
interest to another agency or has popped up in a record somewhere else.</P>

<P>State coordinators designated by FinCEN will do the logging on, as FinCEN
is uncomfortable with giving 50,000 federal agents and 500,000 police officers
direct electronic access to its database. &quot;This is very sensitive
information,&quot; concedes Andy Flodin, special assistant to the FinCEN
director . &quot;We'd have to have additional security safeguards before
we could open it up to every police agency.&quot;</P>

<P>But while the FDB contains only records on major money movements and
thus is not as much of a threat to individual privacy, the Deposit Tracking
System (DTS) is a potential menace. If implemented, the estimated US$12.5
million computer system could be used to penetrate the security of bank
accounts belonging to you, me, and 388 million other bank account holders
in the US.</P>

<P>The government argues that such a system is necessary for two reasons;
first, to assess adequately the funding needed for federal deposit insurance
and second, to locate the assets of individuals ordered by courts to make
restitution for financial crimes - like the savings and loan crooks. (It
seems the government can't trace most of the money they stole.)</P>

<P>The first reason stems from a requirement of the seemingly innocuous
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991- one of Congress's
legislative response to the savings and loan debacle. The Act requires
the FDIC to study the costs, feasibility, and privacy implications of tracking
every bank deposit in the United States.</P>

<P>So far the DTS exists only on paper. The FDIC's completed feasibility
study is currently being examined by Congress, but it is unlikely to act
on before late next year. For the time being, the US$12.5 million price
tag seems to be the biggest drawback to its implementation.</P>

<P>Concerns about he DTS have been widespread, although it has received
scant attention in the mainstream press. But according to Diane Casey,
executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America, the
DTS &quot;would fundamentally change the relationships among banks, consumers,
and the government in ways that have implications beyond banking policy.
Out open and democratic society would be changed profoundly if any agency
of the government maintained the scope of information on private citizens
described in this proposal. It raises questions about our democracy that
would have to be addressed by the highest policy making levels of government.&quot;</P>

<P>The American Bankers association (ABA) voiced equally serious concerns.
The ABA doubts &quot;whether there are any privacy safeguards that would
be adequate to effectively protect this database from use by government
agencies and, eventually, private parties,&quot; an ABA spokesman explains.
&quot;It is inconceivable to the ABA that such a database could be used
only by the FDIC in deposit insurance coverage functions. Such a database...would
provide a wealth of information for investigations being conducted by the
FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the IRS, to name but a few.
Like the baseball diamond in Field of Dreams, build this database and they
will come. Eventually, whether legally or illegally, they will gain access
to this database.&quot;</P>

<P>The FDIC forcefully argued against the DTS in the 234-page draft report
it submitted to Congress in June 1993, but it may not have the bureaucratic
clout necessary to kill the proposal. Wired was told by intelligence analysts
and congressional sources dealing with oversight of the intelligence community
that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are privately clamoring
for the system, apparently disregarding both the privacy issues and the
systems's start up cost (which does not include the additional US$20 million
a year the feasibility study said would be required for facilities, for
salaries and benefits, and for routine hardware and software maintenance).</P>

<P>Further driving the intelligence agencies's desire for the DTS is the
much-hyped role of economic intelligence gathering, a key focus of the
Clinton administration's reform of the intelligence community. Agencies
like the CIA view the system as a boon to their ability to monitor foreign
financial dealings in the US, according to both congressional and intelligence
courses.</P>

<P>Adding Intelligence to the Equation.</P>

<P>Regardless of the form it takes, the sources said, the DTS and any other
financial databases that come down the pike could be easily interfaced
to FinCEN's Artificial Intelligence/Massive Parallel Processing (AI/MPP)
program, a criminal targeting system that will go online in a few years.</P>

<P>Because laundered money is moved undetected along with the millions
of legitimate computerized wire transfers that occur daily, FinCEN's computer
investigations naturally demand expert systems that can single the dirty
money out of the crowd. FinCEN's current Artificial Intelligence capability
allows it to search the Financial Database for suspicious, preprogrammed
patterns of monetary transactions. While not very flexible, the system
identified previously unknown criminal organizations and activities.</P>

<P>But FinCEN has a hush-hush US$2.4 million contract with the US Department
of Energy's Los Alamo National Laboratory to develop what Bruh and other
FinCEN officials described as a powerful &quot;money flow model.&quot;
Unlike FinCEN's current system, Los Alamo's AI software will look for unexplained,
atypical money flows. Coupled with a massively parallel computer system,
the AI/MPP could perform real-time monitoring of the entire US electronic
banking landscape.</P>

<P>FinCEN's AI capabilities currently exploit the Financial Database for
proactive targeting of criminal activity. The system automatically monitors
the entire FDB database, constantly identifying suspicious financial activity
in supercomputer-aided, rapid-response time. In addition to the FDB, FinCEN
is applying AI to the Criminal Referral Forms that must be filed with FinCEN
whenever banks, examiners, and regulators uncover financial activities
they suspect are illegal.</P>

<P>In the near future, all of these government databases will be interfaced
by way of AI/MPP technology. &quot;MPP is critical to FinCEN's ability
to analyze (banking) data to its full capacity,&quot; Bruh insists.</P>

<P>The pure power of such a &quot;database of databases&quot; terrifies
critics. Though FinCEN and other authorities discount the potential for
abuse, tell that to the CIA. It charter forbids it from engaging in domestic
surveillance; nonetheless, it spied on Americans for seven consecutive
presidential administrations (it says it finally ceased its internal spying
in the mid-1970s).</P>

<P>FinCEN's AI operation has been employed legitimately with great success.
Perhaps its least-known project was assisting the CIA in identifying and
tracking the flow of money between Iran's state-sponsored Islamic fundamentalist
terrorist organizations and the men linked to the bombing of the World
Trade Center. According to a Treasury official and confirmed by Anna Fotias,
FinCEN's congressional liaison, FinCEN identified suspicious transaction
reports filed by a bank in New Jersey on wire transfers from Germany to
the accounts of two of the men charged with the bombing. With the bank
account in Germany identified, further AI processing-utilizing intelligence
from the CIA's DESIST computer system, the world's most extensive database
on terrorists-identified a company as a front for an Iranian terrorist
group. Coupled with DESIST's data on the two men's terrorist connections,
FinCEN was able to identify a number of previously unknown conduits of
terrorist funding in the US and abroad. Similarly, FinCEN was crucial in
identifying Iraqi assets in the US that were frozen in the wake of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, according to a Treasury official.</P>

<P>Still, given the CIA's less-than-spotless record, privacy advocates
are likely to find it disturbing that there are some within the walls of
CIA headquarters - apparently unbeknownst to anyone at FinCEN - who want
to merge DESIST with FinCEN's eventual AI/MPP ability and with all the
databases FinCEN routinely surveys. The justification for creating such
a system is compelling: More likely than not it would identify scores of
previously unknown financial conduits to terrorists.</P>

<P>Advocates of a full-time DESIST/FinCEN system carry their argument one
step further: Hooked into the yet to be authorized Deposit Tracking System,
the DESIST/FinCEN system would be able to identify terrorist financial
movements in real time, thus providing early warning of potentially imminent
terrorist actions. Some within the intelligence community take it still
another step: They would have the system tied into the private computers
that hold credit card transactions &quot;so that we could have nearly instant
time-tracking capability,&quot; with the CIA's Counterterrorist Center.</P>

<P>Conversely, a CIA/FinCEN/DTS endeavor could monitor on a real-time basis
the financial activity of narcotics traffickers, since drug dealing also
is within the purview of the CIA. The agency's Counternarcotics Center,
of CNC, already works closely with FinCEN.</P>

<P>Before the CIA would be allowed to tap into a system as sensitive as
the proposed Deposit Tracking System, it would have to clear plenty of
civil liberties hurdles, not the least of which is the prohibition on the
CIA from gathering intelligence on US citizens. As long as the DTS itself
was shielded from direct access by the CIA, proponents could argue that
the operation was allowable under law. Opponents, on the other hand, fear
that the CIA would find a way to download, copy, or otherwise secretly
access the DTS.</P>

<P>&quot;The risk of the CIA getting its hands on this is serious-we know
the kind of unscrupulous people who populate the spook world,&quot; said
a Washington-area private investigator who conducts many legitimate financial
investigations for a CIA-linked firm. &quot;This kind of financial data,
when coupled with other information like a person's credit history, could
be used for blackmail, bribery, and extortion,&quot; said the investigator,
who has a military intelligence background.</P>

<P>Bruce Hemmings is a veteran CIA clandestine-services officer who retired
in 1989. Prior to the DTS proposal, he told Wired that the CIA routinely
digs for financial dirt on people from whom the agency wants specific information.
Typically they are foreign intelligence officers working in the US under
a diplomatic guise, and this financial information is often used as leverage
in getting them to talk. In less civilized venues, this is called blackmail.</P>

<P>DTS could present an inviting mechanism for quieting unwanted dissent
or for defanging an unruly congressional leader bent on exposing some questionable
CIA operation. Although still in its embryonic stage and in spite of the
looming privacy obstacle it will inevitably confront, FinCEN is seen by
many in the government as the catalyst for a powerful, all-seeing, all-knowing,
global, financial-tracking organization. In fact, FinCEN is already working
closely with INTERPOL, and Bruh's deputy just resigned to head up INTERPOL's
US office.</P>

<P>As the privacy debate heats up, FinCEN's digital dirty-money trackers
go on about their work, hoping they don't have to choose sides if what
they do becomes a full-blown privacy invasion problem. As Bruh puts it,
&quot;There's tons of crooks out there who are disguising their criminal
profits. FinCEN needs to computerize as much as possible to be able to
identify the really significant criminals and their activities.&quot;</P>

<P>The question then becomes, at what point does it stop?</P>

<P>ARTICLE <A NAME="2"></A>2</P>

<P>AMERICA'S NUCLEAR SECRETS</P>

<P>Article reprinted from Newsweek December 27, 1993 by The P/\NTHER/TRSI/UMF</P>

<P>Experiments on human guinea pigs, unannounced nuclear tests, a pulsating
wasteland of lethal atomic debris-the legacy of cold-war secrecy and superpower
competition is just how becoming clear.</P>

<P>Scenes from the Nuclear theater of a long cold war. In the 1940s and
'50s, when Americans still trusted their doctors and their government,
researchers subjected hundreds of ill-informed people to doses of nuclear
radiation, in order to study the effect on human beings. Later on, in two
experiments on the West Coast, 131 prison inmates, many of them black,
had their testicles irradiated. From 1963 on, the U.S. government conducted
hundreds of unannounced nuclear tests. The Russians weren't fooled, but
Americans were. Washington last secret underground detonation occurred
as recently as April 4, 1990.</P>

<P>By the 1990s, America was awash in nuclear waste. Tons of plutonium
from arms factories and spent fuel from nuclear reactors were stored haphazardly
and unsafely, sometimes threatening plant workers and nearby residents.
The public still has not been told the true dimensions of the toxic mess.</P>

<P>Bits and pieces of this disturbing story have been leaking out for years
in press articles, scientific studies and congressional hearings. But only
now is the extent of America's nuclear secrets coming into focus. It is
clear that the U.S. government behaved far more maliciously and recklessly
than most Americans ever suspected. The fact that Moscow's rival nuclear
program was probably dirtier still, and even less humane, offers scant
comfort.</P>

<P>Some things cannot be explained away, even by the imperatives of national
security. The most conspicuous agent of revelation so far is Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary. Two weeks ago she blew the whistle on her own department
and the rest of the government's nuclear establishment, by disclosing that,
over a span of 45 years, the United States had set off 204 unannounced
nuclear explosions and conducted radiation experiments on about 600 human
guinea pigs. The scientist who conducted those tests so long ago surely
had rational reasons: the struggle with the Soviet Union, the fear of imminent
nuclear war, the urgent need to unlock all the secrets of the atom, for
purposes both military and medical. But in the aftermath of the cold war,
and measured against today's more stringent ethical and procedural standards,
the science of the early nuclear age can seem almost barbaric. &quot;I
said, 'Who were these people [conducting experiments] and why did this
happen?&quot; O'Leary said in an interview with NEWSWEEK. &quot;The only
thing I could think of was Nazi Germany.&quot;</P>

<P>To date, O'Leary has told only part of the story, the tiny fraction
that has emerged from a 32 million-page mountain of secret documents waiting
to be declassified. Other parts have been dug up recently by local newspapers,
notably The Albuquerque Tribune in New Mexico, and Westword, a Denver weekly.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, weighed
in last week with the first conclusive evidence that the U.S. government
had conducted radioactive-warfare tests in the atmosphere. But information
is being pried out of the bureaucracy an inch at a time. O'Leary had to
fight with the Pentagon through 17 drafts of disclosure documents in order
to declassify the amount of plutonium contained in stockpiles throughout
the country (33.5 metric tons). She even had to battle her own staff to
release a report two weeks ago on the deteriorating storage facilities
for spent nuclear fuel.</P>

<P>Many facts have been uncovered by Congress as well including a subcommittee
chaired in 1986 by Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts. His report was
entitled &quot;American Nuclear Guinea Pigs.&quot; After studying 31 experiments
dating back to 1945, Markey wrote that U.S. citizens &quot;became nuclear
calibration devices for experiments run amok.&quot; He also charged: &quot;Too
many of these experiments used human subjects that were captive audiences
or populations ... considered 'expendable': the elderly, prisoners, hospital
patients, who might not have retained their full faculties for informed
consent.&quot;</P>

<P>Starting in 1963, 131 inmates at two prisons in Oregon and Washington
state were recruited for experiments paid for by the Atomic Energy Commission,
a predecessor of today's Department of Energy (DOE). Each volunteer was
paid about $200 and had to sign a consent form. &quot;I hereby agree to
submit to X-ray radiation of my scrotum and testes,&quot; said the form
used in Oregon. The inmates were warned about the possibility of sterility
and radiation burns, but the Oregon form said nothing about a risk of testicular
cancer. After the experiment the Oregon men were given vasectomies-&quot;to
avoid the possibility of contaminating the general population with irradiation-induced
mutants,&quot; wrote the late Dr. Carl Heller, who ran the tests. For that
reason, Roman Catholic inmates were not allowed to participate, Markey's
report noted.</P>

<P>The men were given varied doses of radiation as high as 600 roentgen
(today the largest recommended dose is six roentgen for an entire year.)
Those who received 15 roentgen or more became sterile temporarily. There
is no evidence that any of them developed cancer as a result of the experiment.
But none of the Washington prisoners has been tracked since the early 1970s:
the inmates themselves didn't want continued medical scrutiny. In Oregon,
where no follow-up tests were done either, some of the prisoners filed
suit in 1976 demanding medical treatment. Eventually the Oregon state Legislature
intervened, granting continued treatment to nine of the men and awarding
them with a cash payment. The nine men split a total of $2,215.</P>

<P>Hot shots: Last month The Albuquerque Tribune published a series naming
five of 18 hospital patients who were given &quot;tracer&quot; injections
of plutonium in a government sponsored study between 1945 and 1947. Many
of the patients were expected to die soon, but some cases didn't work out
that way. Elmer Allen, an impoverished 36-year-old railroad porter from
Texas, got a shot of plutonium in his injured leg. Three days later the
leg was amputated above the knee and taken away by researchers. Allen didn't
die for another 44 years, but long life was no blessing to him. His daughter,
Elmerine Whitfield said he had seizures and was severely depressed. He
drank too much. &quot;I believe my father was aware something had been
done to him.&quot; said Whitfield. But she insisted he never gave informed
consent to the experiment. &quot;I know he didn't understand plutonium,&quot;
she said.</P>

<P>Scientists who worked in the dawn of the nuclear age defend the validity
of the plutonium tests. &quot;We should be extremely cautious about criticizing
their work.&quot; says John Simpson, a retired astrophysicist who worked
on health and safety issues as a group leader on the Manhattan Project,
which developed the first atomic bomb. If research had not been done on
humans, he says, &quot;radioactive dangers would be greater throughout
the world today.&quot;</P>

<P>Biophysicist Newell Stanard, an authority on the history of radiological
research, says the plutonium tests were launched because several Manhattan
Project workers in Los ALAMO, N.M. had been exposed to the material. No
one knew for sure how much damage the plutonium would do to them or how
quickly and thoroughly it would be expelled from their bodies. &quot;There
had been a lot or work with animals that showed rates of fecal and urine
excretion of the plutonium, how much went to bone marrow and so on,&quot;
says Stannard. &quot;But there was this big question: will it be the same
in man? The Manhattan Project said we've got to do experiments in terminal
patients and see if the results are the same as in animals.&quot;</P>

<P>Stannard says that 11 of the 18 tests were done in Rochester, N.Y. by
a respected internist, Dr. Sam Bassett; the others were scattered around
the country. Were the patients fully informed? &quot;I simply don't know,&quot;
says Stannard. &quot;I do know that Sam Bassett was a very straightforward,
honest guy. I'm sure he told the patients he was going to do something.&quot;
But plutonium research was a top-secret subject in those days. &quot;I
have a feeling Bassett told people they were taking something for the war
effort,&quot; says Stannard.</P>

<P>Many other tests conducted on humans were benign and were performed
quite casually, without a lot of red tape. &quot;The level of acceptable
informed consent has changed,&quot; says Dr. Merril Eisenbud, professor
emeritus of environmental medicine at New York University Medical Center.
He describes some of his own research. &quot;Open-air [nuclear] weapons
testing left iodine in the milk worldwide,&quot; he says. &quot;One of
my experiments was to determine the significance in terms of the dose absorbed
by a child's thyroid. We used to get the children to come over from a pediatric
clinic with their moms. We'd explain what we were doing, sit each child
down and-using a scintillometer that didn't even touch him-measure radiation
in the thyroid. We'd give the child a lollipop, and that was the end of
that. Today you'd have to fill out so much paperwork that it would discourage
people from participating in the test.&quot;</P>

<P>In the 1940s and '50s, many doctors weren't in the habit of explaining
things to their patients. &quot;Doctors weren't questioned,&quot; says
Dr. Andrew Davis of Chicago, a frequent writer on radiation-health issues.
&quot;When you combine that with radiation technology, born of secrecy
in the name of military security, it becomes easier to understand-if not
condone-these experiments and accidents. Dr. Kildare could do no wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>Death Spray: In reality, of course, some researchers did numerous wrongs,
as they are now defined. According to the GAO report, radiation was deliberately
released into the atmosphere in at least a dozen secret tests in New Mexico,
Tennessee and Utah between 1948 and 1952. The tests were part of an effort
to develop a radiological weapon-or to defend against one, if the Soviets
developed a death spray. At about the same time, the Hanford Nuclear Facility
in Richland, Wash., was regularly showering its neighbors with radioactivity.
A secret internal memo uncovered in 1986 described the infamous Green Run
experiments, in which plant managers deliberately released a huge cloud
of radioactive iodine-131, to see how far downwind it could be traced.
The could floated over Spokane and drifted all the way to the California-Oregon
border, carrying hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of times more radiation
than that emitted by the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania.</P>

<P>Now that nuclear testing has ended, at least in the United States, the
government is left with a vast, pulsating landscape of atomic waste dumps
to clean up. The people who developed nuclear reactors and weapons were
no more prescient about future environmental hazards than they were about
health risks. The storage of spent fuel and other nuclear materials was
shockingly sloppy. &quot;Every time you turn over a new document, there's
a $5 billion problem,&quot; says Dan Reicher, a special assistant to O'Leary.</P>

<P>The DOE's nuclear-weapons complex, spread over 4,000 square miles in
13 states, appears to be particularly hazardous. Steven Blush, a DOE safety
official who was forced out of his job last spring, wrote a lurid report
charging that the bomb factories averaged three accidents a day in 1991
and '92. Most of the mishaps were minor, but a few of them posed potentially
major health threats to factory workers and nearby residents, Blush charged.</P>

<P>One of the most conspicuous problem plants is the DOE's weapons facility
at Rocky Flats, outside Denver. Starting in 1989, a federal grand jury
collected evidence about alleged violations of environmental law there.
Early last year the grand jury tried to indict DOE officials and executives
of Rockwell International, a former operator of the plant, accusing them
of participating in &quot;an ongoing criminal enterprise&quot; by ignoring
environmental laws.</P>

<P>The local U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, and instead announced
a plea bargain with Rockwell, which agreed to pay a fine of $18.5 million-slightly
less than the annual performance bonus it received for successful stewardship
of the plant. The grand jurors continued to press their case, and when
the story leaked to Westword, they found themselves under investigation
for violation of secrecy laws. Now the grand jurors are hoping to testify
before Congress. &quot;It's doubtful that you could find a bigger environmental
criminal than the Department of Energy,&quot; charges their lawyer, Jonathan
Turley, an expert on environmental law at George Washington University.
&quot;It hasn't changed with the new administration,&quot; he maintains.</P>

<P>Morning after: O'Leary would dispute that. The secretary bucked her
own bureaucracy by insisting that the DOE release a report on deteriorating
storage sites for spent nuclear fuel. Aides warned that disclosure could
cause liability problems. O'Leary insisted. &quot;I want this done,&quot;
she said. But there's a lot more to do. &quot;It's as though you had a
party every night for 45 years, and you never cleaned it up,&quot; says
Thomas Grumbly, DOE assistant secretary for environmental restoration and
waste management.</P>

<P>Grumbly is a worrier. He predicts that the figures currently quoted
for the total cost of the cleanup-from $200 billion to $300 billion-may
not even be close. &quot;It could be a couple of times larger than that,&quot;
he says. He frets about the notorious storage tanks at Hanford, where so
many different wastes have been dumped that no one knows exactly what kind
of witches' brew is in them. &quot;Every time the phone rings after 10
o'clock at night, I think 'This is it we've had an event',&quot; says Grumbly.
Like his boss, he things the time has come for &quot;throwing open the
blinds&quot; to shed some light on the nuclear-waste crisis. The government's
complete disregard of the byproducts of its cold-war born nuclear obsession
has left us with &quot;the single largest environmental and health risk
in the nation,&quot; he says. It may also be the last of America's nuclear
secrets-and perhaps the most dangerous of them all.</P>

<P>A HUMAN HORROR STORY Plutonium: What doctors didn't tell Eda Charlton</P>

<P>Eda Schultz Charlton was alone and sick when she visited the University
of Rochester's Strong Memorial Hospital in the fall of 1945. A protein
deficiency had swollen her ankles and covered her body in a serious rash.
Doctors also suspected a mild case of hepatitis. The 48 year old seamstress
was newly widowed-her husband had died suddenly a year earlier. Her only
son was in the service. Physicians put her on a high protein, low salt
diet.</P>

<P>They also made Charlton an unwitting subject in a grotesque government
sponsored medical experiment. On Nov. 27, 1945, according to records unearthed
by The Albuquerque Tribune, doctors at Stong working for the Manhattan
Project injected her with plutonium-239 to study how quickly the body rids
itself of the radioactive substance. (The hospital never sanctioned the
experiments.) Between 1945 and 1947, she and most of the 17 other patients
in the secret program-11 of them in Rochester-received dosages of about
.3 microcurie. That is about 43 times what is now regarded as the safe
lifetime limit. Charlton wouldn't learn of the official poisoning for another
30 years.</P>

<P>Family members say they suspected she was monitored during her routine
checkups over the years at Strong. The visits often turned into stays lasting
several days-even when it was clear she wasn't all that ill. &quot;They
used to keep her in a section that was like a hotel,&quot; says her son,
Fred Schultz. Once his mother said that doctors placed her in a sealed
room to check her body for radiation. Efforts to glean any information
were always rebuffed. In the early 1970s, the family quizzed one doctor
who'd treated Charlton since 1950. &quot;When I asked her about plutonium,
she'd say, 'I don't know a thing about it',&quot; recalled her daughter-in-law,
Helen Schultz.</P>

<P>Hospital officials say they informed Charlton and other living victims
of the experiment on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1974. The
Schultzes say they learned about it from a doctor at Strong five years
later. Doctors claim Charlton suffered no health problems from the radiation.
She died of a heart attack in 1983. But Fred Schultz, now 73, remains bitter.
&quot;I was over there fighting the Germans who were conducting these horrific
medical experiments,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time my own country
was conducting them on my mother.&quot;</P>

<P>SINS OF A PARANOID AGE</P>

<P>Cold War: Desperate times made for desperate-and dangerous-measures</P>

<P>In 1949, WHEN MOST AMERICANS wanted nothing more than to &quot;go to
the movies and drink Coke,&quot; as W. Averell Harriman once put it, the
Soviets exploded a Nuclear bomb. The onset of the cold war came as a cruel
surprise. The United States had just won World War II. Was World War III
around the corner? By 1951, when the CIA received an intelligence tip that
seemed to indicate that the Russians were about to corner the world market
in LSD, anxiety about communism had become paranoia. The CIA was particularly
obsessed with mind control. At show trials in the East bloc, innocents
with glazed eyes were confessing to impossible crimes, while American POWs
in the Korean War were reportedly being &quot;brainwashed&quot; by the
Chinese. Had the communists developed some of the new mind-bending drugs
that could be used as a mass weapon against the West?</P>

<P>The LSD scare, like many intelligence tips in that era, turned out to
be bogus. But that didn't stop the CIA from taking steps to develop its
own mind-control program, code-named MKUltra. The technique that most intrigued
the agency was LSD, a new psychoactive drug that could induce hallucinations.
Unfazed when one of the agency's own researchers jumped out a window after
experimenting with LSD in 1953, the CIA hired prostitutes in Greenwich
Village, N.Y., and San Francisco to slip LSD doses to unsuspecting johns.
CIA researchers dutifully recorded the results from behind two-way mirrors.
Dozens of unwitting lowlifes went on wild trips, but the agency never did
learn how to control anyone's mind. The experiment was finally abandoned
in 1963.</P>

<P>The nuclear experiments that are now coming to light are just come of
the examples of how far America went in the cause of combating global communism.
In another phase of operation MKUltra, the CIA-seeking the perfect assassin-
tried to create &quot;guided animals.&quot; In one experiment, the agency
wired up a cat (its tail was the antenna) that had a habit of wandering
off the job and was eventually run over by a taxi. For years the Pentagon
and the Atomic Energy Commission were conducting all manner of secret tests-from
releasing clouds of radiation into the atmosphere in a determined attempt
to build bigger and better bombs, to irradiating the testicles of prison
inmates in order to find our how much would cause sterility. As it turned
out, almost all the reports of Russian superiority in the cold war were
hyped. When the development of the U-2 spy plane allowed overflights in
the mid-to late 1950s, it was discovered that the &quot;bomber gap&quot;
and the &quot;missile gap&quot; were phony. The only gap was the other
way around: In 1961, the Pentagon had 98 missiles aimed at the Soviet Union,
the Kremlin no more than 35 aimed at the United States.</P>

<P>For all its cold-war glamour, the CIA was not a very effective espionage
agency in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Though it had reasonable success
overthrowing left-leaning governments in the Third World, the agency utterly
failed to penetrate the Kremlin (admittedly a difficult task against a
police state). Still, it did not serve top leaders to admit this to the
public.</P>

<P>In order to persuade lawmakers to pay for worthy causes like the Marshall
Plan, it was sometimes necessary to make things &quot;clearer than the
truth,&quot; said Dean Acheson, President Truman's secretary of state.
If that meant scaring people, so be it. Certainly, the people were ready
to be scared: families built fallout shelters, while children learned how
to duck under their desks.</P>

<P>Washington officials lied in part because they could get away with it.
The press was cozier with policymakers in the 1950s, and lawmakers didn't
really want to know what the CIA was up to, as long as the cause was battling
the Red Menace. Hungry for higher budgets, the Pentagon inflated the threat
it faced. And over time, even the most cynical politicians began to believe
their own rhetoric. In the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy
was still warning about the missile gap. When his defense secretary, Robert
McNamara, publicly admitted that none existed, Kennedy privately chastised
him for telling the truth. McNamara apologized-and promptly ordered a massive
buildup of America's nuclear arsenal.</P>

<P>ARTICLE <A NAME="3"></A>3</P>

<P>The Randy Weaver Case...Another Federal Fiasco!</P>

<P>Reprinted from American Rifleman November 1993 by The P/\NTHER -TRZ-TRSI-UMF-</P>

<P>Seeing his dog, Striker, shot to death by masked intruders clad in camouflage,
Sammy Weaver, 14, fired back in fear for his life. The 4 ft, 11&quot;-tall
youngster was hit in the arm, then shot in the back as he turned to run
for home. He died instantly, killed by an agent of the federal government.
Cradling her 10 month old daughter in her arms, Vicki Weaver stood in the
doorway of her home, mourning her slain son, unaware that she herself had
only seconds to live. In an instant a bullet tore into Vicki Weaver's face,
blew through her jaw and severed her carotid artery. The bullet was fired
from 200 yds. away by an agent of the federal government.</P>

<P>What had the Weaver family done to bring FBI snipers and submachine-gun-toting
U.S. Marshals to the woods around their cabin on Ruby Ridge in northern
Idaho? Why did the government act as though the Weavers and forfeited the
protections guaranteed all Americans by the United States Constitution?
Who made the decisions that led to their unjustified deaths and also to
the death of deputy U.S. Marshal William Degan?</P>

<P>For the six men working near Weaver's plywood cabin on Ruby Ridge, Aug.
21 1992, was another day on a job that had been going on more than 16 months.
Their employer, the U.S. government, was spending $13,000 a week, and there
had been no end in sight to the work.</P>

<P>The cabin-really a shack-was home to 44-year-old former Green Beret
Randy Weaver and his family-wife, Vicki; son, Sammy; and daughters, Sara,
Rachel and Elisheba. It was also home to their young friend, Kevin Harris.
There were subsistence hunters, and tended a garden, putting up vegetables.
A generator produced occasional electricity. They had no TV, no radio.</P>

<P>This day there were some new men on the job site not far from the cabin-one,
42-year-old William Degan, had been brought to northern Idaho on special
orders. He was to help plan a successful conclusion to the job.</P>

<P>The men in the woods were dressed in their work clothes-camouflage commando
outfits complete with masks. They carried the tools of their trade-two-way
radios rigged for quiet operation, night vision equipment, semi-automatic
handguns, fully automatic military rifles and at least one silenced HK
submachine gun. One of the men was a medic, prepared to care for any casualties.</P>

<P>The Weaver family had dogs. Somebody threw a rock to test their reaction.
A golden retriever barked near the cabin and came running their way. A
mission somebody in the Marshal Service had dubbed &quot;Operation Northern
Exposure&quot; was about to end.</P>

<P>The &quot;op&quot; had included use of jet reconnaissance overflights
with aerial photographic analysis by the Defense Mapping Agency, and placement
of high-resolution video equipment recording activity by the Weaver family
from sites 1 1/2 miles away-160 hours worth of tape used.</P>

<P>For nearly a year and a half, federal agents had roamed the area, picking
locations for surveillance and for snipers. Degan belonged to the Special
Operations Group, the Marshals' national SWAT team. The six on-site this
day were deputy U.S. Marshals.</P>

<P>The target of all of this-and of a Federal law enforcement and prosecution
effort that would eventually total approximately $3 million-was Randy Weaver.
What kind of criminal was he to demand this kind of attention? Was he a
major drug dealer? Serial killer? Was he a terrorist bomber?</P>

<P>No. On Oct. 24, 1989, Weaver sold two shotguns whose barrels arguably
measured 1/4&quot; less than the 18&quot; length determined arbitrarily
by Congress to be legal. The H&amp;R single-barrels 12-ga. and Remington
pump were sold to a good friend who instructed Weaver to shorten the barrels.
The &quot;good friend&quot; was an undercover informant working for the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), who later told reporters
he was in it &quot;mainly for the excitement.&quot;</P>

<P>Eight months after he sold the shotguns, Weaver was approached by two
BATF agent with an offer-spy on the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist
hate group headquartered in northern Idaho, or go to jail. Weaver refused
to become a government informer, and-six moths later-he was indicted on
the shotgun charge.</P>

<P>On Jan. 17, 1991, as Weaver and his wife were driving to town for supplies,
they encountered a pickup truck camper with its hood up, a man and a woman
seeming to be in trouble. The Weavers stopped to offer their help. A horde
of federal agents piled out of the camper. A pistol was pressed against
Weaver's neck. Vicki Weaver was thrown to the slushy ground.</P>

<P>Weaver was arraigned before a federal magistrate, who later admitted
he cited the wrong law. Out on bond, Weaver went back to his cabin. According
to friends who testified in court, he and his wife vowed not to have any
more dealings with the courts of the federal government. They would just
stay on their mountain.</P>

<P>A hearing was set on the shotgun matter for Federal Court in Moscow,
Idaho. The government notified Weaver by letter that he was to appear March
20, 1991. The actual hearing was held February 20-one month earlier. The
error in dates was enough to give rise to a memo within the Marshal Service
saying the case would be a washout. (Weaver did not show for the wrong
date, either.) U.S. Attorney Ron Howen went to the grand jury anyway, and
Weaver was indicted for failure to appear.</P>

<P>But why had the BATF picked Randy Weaver to set up as an informer? He
was a man devoted to his family, a man with no criminal record, a veteran
who served his country with honor. It was Weaver's beliefs that made him
an ideal target. His unorthodox religious and political views were far
outside mainstream America. He was a white separatist. And, Randy Weaver
was little, a nobody.</P>

<P>Over the next 16 months, the feds painted Weaver as racist, as anti-semitic,
as a criminal. But they had to entrap him into his only crime, altering
two guns. The media were unquestioning. In print and on TV and radio, Weaver's
home-the plywood shack he built himself-became a &quot;mountain fortress,&quot;
and then &quot;a bunker,&quot; and &quot;a stronghold protected by a cache
of 15 weapons and ammunition capable of piercing armored personnel carriers.&quot;</P>

<P>The common shotguns Weaver sold became the chosen &quot;weapon of drug
dealers and terrorists&quot; of &quot;gangster weapons&quot; that &quot;have
no sporting use.&quot; The media always added the universal out...&quot;agents
said.&quot; But there were no gangsters. There were no terrorist or drug
dealers, just Weaver, the gun buyer and the government.</P>

<P>It was all a lie. Hate-hype. People believed it, maybe even the agents
who planted the hate-hype began to believe it. It all ceased to matter
on August 21, when Striker barked and sniffed out the agents spying on
the cabin-lives changed, lives ended.</P>

<P>Nobody, except the people who were there, knows exactly what happened
next. There were several versions of the story. But some facts jibe. Randy
Weaver's little boy, Sammy-a kid whose voice hadn't yet changed-and Kevin
Harris followed Striker. Harris and Weaver later said they thought the
dog was chasing a deer. Harris carried a bolt-action hunting rifle. The
boy also had a gun.</P>

<P>Without a warning a federal agent fired a burst into Striker, killing
him. (It came out in court later that there had been a plan to take the
dog &quot;out of the equation.&quot;) The boy, frightened, shot back, and
when one of the agents fired another burst, Sammy lay dead.</P>

<P>Kevin Harris shot deputy William Degan in the chest. He died a few moments
later. The shooting ended relatively quickly. The agents would claim Harris
fired first. Harris claimed he fired after the boy was shot. Agents told
the media their men had been pinned down for eight hours. It was lie.</P>

<P>The dog was dead. The boy was dead. Deputy Degan was dead. Two American
families had tragically lost loved-ones. During the night hours. Randy
Weaver and Kevin Harris brought the little boy's body to a shed near the
cabin and washed.</P>

<P>Deputy Degan's shooting brought in the FBI. Soon, the Weaver's property
was ringed by a huge force of FBI, BATF, U.S. Marshals, Idaho state police
and local law enforcement and Idaho National Guard. Among the federal law
enforcement commanders was Richard Rogers, the head of the FBI's hostage
rescue team, which includes its snipers. On the flight out, he took an
extraordinary step-he decided to alter radically the prescribed rules of
engagement of FBI sharpshooters.</P>

<P>Normally, agents can only shoot when they are facing death or grievous
harm. But the 11 snipers that were positioned around the Weaver cabin were
given new orders: &quot;If any adult in the compound is observed with a
weapon after the surrender announcement is made, deadly force can and should
be employed to neutralize the individual.&quot; This meant Randy Weaver's
wife would be fair game. It went on: &quot;If any adult male is observed
with a weapon prior to the announcement, deadly force can and should be
employed if the shot can be taken without endangering the children.&quot;
(Emphasis added.)</P>

<P>In words reminiscent of hollow justifications used in Waco, Texas, federal
spokesmen kept telling the media of their concern for the children. In
fact, Gene Glenn, the agent in charge of the siege, told The New York Times
he considered the kids to be hostages. Yet they'd already killed one child.</P>

<P>The negotiators were not in place, and no effort had been made to contact
the Weavers, when Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris-armed-and 16 year old Sara
Weaver left then cabin and moved to the shed where Sam's body lay.</P>

<P>As the three reached the shed, an FBI sniper some 200 yds. away aimed
at Weaver. He told the court he was aiming for the spine, just below the
neck. He missed; shot Weaver in the back of the arm, the bullet exiting
through the armpit.</P>

<P>Sara later told Spokesman Review staff writer Jess Walter in a copyrighted
story: &quot;I ran up to my dad and tried to shield him and pushed him
toward the house. If they were going to shoot someone, I was going to make
them shoot a kid.&quot;</P>

<P>At the cabin, Vicki Weaver was waiting at the door, holding her infant
daughter, Elisheba. The sniper fired again. His bullet hit Vicki Weaver.
She was dead before the baby hit the floor, miraculously unhurt. Harris
was hit by bullet fragments and bone from Vicki's skull. He was bleeding
badly. Randy Weaver, daughters Sara and 10 year old Rachel all saw the
violent death.</P>

<P>Later, sniper Lon Horiuchi stated in court that killing Vicki Weaver
had been a mistake; that he was aiming for Kevin Harris. Defense attorney
Spence asked him, &quot;You wanted to kill him didn't you?&quot; He answered,
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</P>

<P>Sara Weaver recounted the night following her mother's death. Against
from reporter Jess Walter's story:</P>

<P>&quot;Elisheba cried during the night. She was saying, 'Mama, mama,mama.'...Dad
was crying and saying, 'I know baby. I know baby. Your Mama's gone..'&quot;</P>

<P>She told Walter that on Sunday, they tried to yell at federal agents
and get their attention, to tell them that her mother was dead. She said
they got no response. Instead they would hear FBI negotiators. &quot;They'd
come on real late at night and say, 'Come out and talk to us, Mrs. Weaver.
How's the baby, Mrs Weaver,' in a real smart-alecky voice. Or they'd say
'Good morning, Randall. How'd you sleep? We're having pancakes. What are
you having?'&quot;</P>

<P>The FBI later claimed it had no idea that its sniper had shot Vicki
Weaver. Yet, a New York Times stringer quoted FBI sources as saying they
were &quot;using a listening device that allowed them to hear conversations,
and even the baby's cries in the cabin.&quot; Another lie?</P>

<P>On Thursday, August 27, radio newsman Paul Harvey used his noon broadcast
to reach the Weavers, who he'd learned were regular listeners. Urging Randy
Weaver to surrender, Harvey said, prophetically, &quot;Randy, you'll have
a much better chance with a jury of understanding homefolks than you could
ever have with any kind of shoot-out with 200 frustrated lawmen.&quot;</P>

<P>As part of their efforts to make contact with the Weavers, the FBI sent
a robot with a telephone to the cabin. But the robot also had a shotgun
pointed at the door, so the Weavers feared that reaching for the phone
could result in death or injury.</P>

<P>Somewhere in all of this, the FBI discovered the body of Sammy. They
told the news media they didn't know he'd been killed.</P>

<P>The siege began to unravel six days after Vicki Weaver had been killed.
Her body remained in the kitchen of the cabin all that time. Sara crawled
around her to get food and water for her family. It was during this time
that Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris dictated their version of their story
to Sara. In this letter, Weaver accused his government of murdering his
wife.</P>

<P>The news media, based on information from the feds, repeatedly reported
that Vicki had been killed in &quot;an exchange of gunfire&quot; or in
a &quot;gun battle.&quot; More spin control.</P>

<P>The only shots were two-from the government's sniper.</P>

<P>Kevin Harris was the first person to come out. Sunday, August 30, badly
wounded, he was rushed to a Spokane hospital where he was treated and charged
with murder. A magistrate told him he was facing the death penalty.</P>

<P>The rest of the family came out on the next day. The surrender was negotiated
not by the FBI-but by Bo Gritz, former Green Beret hero.</P>

<P>All the lies and federal spin control over the story were about to end.
The case was going to court.</P>

<P>The 36 day trial took place in the U.S. District Court in Boise, with
Judge Edward Lodge presiding. The jury of eight women and four men heard
the government put on 56 witnesses. The defense rested without calling
a single witness, confident that the government had destroyed its own case.
They were right.</P>

<P>The jury deliberated for nearly three weeks, and found Harris not guilty
of murder or any other charges leveled against him. They found Weaver not
guilty of eight federal felony counts. The judge had earlier thrown out
two other counts.</P>

<P>Weaver was found guilty of two counts: failing to appear in court and
violating his bail conditions. He was declared not guilty of the gun charge-the
seed of all this misery.</P>

<P>It was a bizarre trial, full of contradictions, with government witnesses
countering each other's stories as to the events of August 21, and countering
the events leading up to Vicki Weaver's death the next day.</P>

<P>The question of who fired first-Harris or the Marshals-was key to the
jury deciding on the murder charge against Harris. In the end they believed
Kevin Harris acted in self-defense. Earlier, the death penalty had been
ruled out. The law the prosecution cited had been struck down by the U.S.
Supreme Court two decades before.</P>

<P>The government spent days going over the Weavers' religious views, trying
to establish they were racist and demonstrated a long-lived conspiracy
to violently confront the government. The jury didn't believe it.</P>

<P>Marshal Service witnesses told about a series of pre-seige scenarios
to root Weaver out of his cabin. But when pressed by the defense, they
said they never considered simply knocking on the door and arresting him.</P>

<P>During the trial, the government admitted that the FBI had tampered
with the evidence; that the crime scene photos given the defense were phony
reenactments. Physical evidence had been removed and replaced. The prosecutor
knew and had failed to tell the defense.</P>

<P>The prosecution also withheld documents that might have helped the defense.
When ordered by the judge to produce them immediately, the FBI sent the
material from Washington, D.C., via Fourth Class mail, which took two weeks
to cross the country. For prosecutorial misconduct, the judge ordered the
government to pay part of the defense attorneys' fees, an action almost
unheard of in a criminal case. Prosecutor Howen also was forced to apologize
in open court. At the end of the trial, he collapsed in the middle of a
statement, telling the judge, &quot;I can't go on.&quot;</P>

<P>Gerry Spence told the jury, &quot;This is a murder case, but the people
who committed the murder have not been charged. The people who committed
the murder are not here in court.&quot;</P>

<P>After the trial, Spence told the New York Times, &quot;A jury today
has said that you can't kill somebody just because you wear badges, then
cover up those homicides by prosecuting the innocent.&quot; &quot;What
are we going to do now about the deaths of Vicki Weaver, a mother who was
killed with a baby in her arms, and Sammy Weaver, a boy who was shot in
the back?&quot; &quot;Here you had federal agents come into a little county
in northern Idaho, suspend state law and then say they had the right to
eliminate anyone with a gun.&quot; &quot;The crime he committed was not
sawing off a shotgun. The crime he committed was refusing to go undercover
for the BATF.&quot;-Garry Spence</P>

<P>Spence has asked the Boundary County, Idaho, prosecutor to bring charges
against various federal agents. Should that happen, lingering questions
about the Weaver case finally may be answered. Should that happen, lingering
questions about the Weaver case finally may be answered. Should that happen
another jury undoubtedly will serve notice to those who have forgotten
that the United States government is supposed to serve its citizen, not
entrap them, not defame them, not falsify evidence against them and absolutely
not kill their children.</P>

<P>ENEMY ATTACK AND UFO POTENTIAL Few Residents of the United States, except
for those in Hawaii, have experienced an enemy attack on their hometown
in this century; some think they have. The Great Los Angeles Air Raid of
February 26, 1942, began at 2:25 A.M. when the U.S. Army announced the
approach of hostile aircraft and the city's air raid warning system went
into effect for the first time in World War II. &quot;Suddenly the night
was rent by sirens. Searchlights began to sweep the sky. Minutes later
gun crews at Army forts along the coast line began snapping on their lights...
The din continued for two hours. Finally the guns fell silent. The enemy,
evidently, had been routed. Los Angeles began to taste the exhilaration
of its first military victory.&quot;</P>

<P>WHAT IS WAR?</P>

<P>&quot;War is a man-mad disaster. Earthquakes and floods happen to mankind,
but man makes war himself.&quot; War is a struggle in which two or more
large groups of people try to destroy or conquer each other. There are
&quot;hot&quot; wars and there are &quot;cold&quot; wars. When overt acts
of aggression involving force are employed, it is a &quot;hot&quot; war,
and there was a time in history when such wars were actually declared,
but not in the past half-century. However, the United States in each decade
since World War II has found itself involved in at least limited military
actions. Since the 1940s there have been the Korean &quot;police&quot;
action in the 1950s, the Vietnam conflict in the 1960s and 1970s, the Panama
invasion, and many other incidents arising showing the possibility of the
U.S. becoming involved in another &quot;World&quot; war.</P>

<P>Guard Against Complacency</P>

<P>It is easy for those of us in North America to consider the possibility
of enemy attack as being quite remote. While it is true that this continent
has not been visited with the death and destruction accompanying past wars,
we have found in each generation that wars are all to common and could
indeed at some future date involve our country. Certainly many portions
of North America are within easy range of enemy nuclear submarines and
we could at the least expected time be suddenly involved in a conflict.</P>

<P>The Persian Gulf War served as an example of how quickly the United
States can find itself in military conflict. Hence, there is always a need
to guard against the complacency that has evolved as our country has enjoyed
relative insulation from previous wars.</P>

<P>THE UFO THREAT-A FACT</P>

<P>In this chapter we will now turn our attention to the very real threat
posed by Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), whether they exist or not.
The well-documented and highly publicized War of the Worlds radio drama
by Orson Welles shows how even a perceived existence to alien creatures
can cause very real disaster-like conditions and panic among a given populace.
In addition, if the apparent visits by alien beings and their space vehicles
should pose any type of threat, it will as always be the fire service that
is called upon to provide the first line of life-saving defense and disaster
mitigation.</P>

<P>On April 25, 1991, radio station KSHE in St. Louis, Missouri, was fined
$25,000 by the Federal Communications Commission for broadcasting a mock
warning of a nuclear attack during the Persian Gulf War. The seriousness
with which the FCC treated this case is indicative of the very real panic
that can be created from even illusionary or fictional phenomena. Certainly
if these unexplainable events become more prevalent, the possibility of
panic could be even greater: and again, the fire department will be the
agency called upon to handle the situation. (35) Hence, as we near the
year 2000 and move beyond, any comprehensive disaster plan should address
the potential for panic and other deleterious effects that might befall
a populated area when unexplainable phenomena occur. We will see, as we
continue our discussion in this chapter, that widespread blackouts, communication
disruptions, and other potentially disastrous conditions have been linked
directly to UFO sightings. Hence, fire service leaders who want to ensure
that their disaster planning is complete will not neglect an appendix to
outline those things that could be done in preparation for the occurrence
of such phenomena.</P>

<P>Throughout this book, many of the references to actual events are based
on the experiences of both of the authors. However, in this area of UFOs
and their potential, we are relying largely on the research and experiences
of Charles Bahme. Chuck has made a considerable study of this subject and
is acquiring many publications and VCR tapes to augment his library on
this and related phenomena. His interest in UFOs was greatly heightened
when Congress in 1969 adopted a law (14 CFR Ch. V Part 1211 - Extraterrestrial
Exposure) which gave the NASA Administrator the arbitrary discretion to
quarantine under armed guard any object, person, or other form of life
which has been extraterrestrially exposed. The very fact that our congressmen
believed there was a necessity for such drastic authority made Chuck wonder
if they had only our astronauts in mind when they adopted it. Could it
be applied to anyone who has had a UFO encounter? Whether it has or not
is not likely to be a topic for public dissemination.</P>

<P>UFO Discussion-Why Now?</P>

<P>The subject of UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) was not included in
previous editions of this book. The first edition was the Handbook of Disaster
Control which Chuck personally published in 1952 following his release
from active naval duty in the Korean War. Although his services in the
conflict as Security Coordinator for the Chief of Naval Operations involved
the creation of a worldwide disaster control organization for the protection
of the physical properties of the Navy, it must be admitted that the directives
approved for this new organization did not reflect any significant concern
for a flying saucer threat to its shore establishment. That was in the
1950s. Now that we are in the 1990s it is doubtful that the UFO potential
would be brushed off so lightly by our military security forces. This change
of attitude was evidenced as far back as December 24, 1959, when the Inspector
General of the Air Force issued the following Operations and Training Order:
&quot;Unidentified Flying Objects-sometimes treated lightly by the press
and referred to as 'Flying Saucers'-must be rapidly and accurately identified
as serious Air Force business...&quot; (36)</P>

<P>There is no uncertainty about the reality of the war between nations
on our planet and the disastrous effects of military actions. The 200 sorties
flown every hour against Iraq in the Persian Gulf provided ample evidence
of global war's destructive power. On the other hand, there are many persons
who may believe that a discussion of the theoretical harm that could be
caused by a real or imaginary invasion of UFOs would be &quot;far out!&quot;
But this is not so for the thousands of witnesses of unexplained aerial
phenomena. To them it is also serious business.</P>

<P>Chuck's interest in UFOs commenced during the early morning hours of
August 26, 1942, while he was roller skating from his house to the nearest
fire station a few blocks away: the wail of sirens had signaled his recall
to fire duty, and with the stringent blackout orders in effect, driving
was not wise: besides, it was much more exciting to be out in the open
where he could see the spectacular aerial &quot;fireworks&quot; that filled
the heavens all around him. Few residents of the U.S. had ever experienced
a real or imaginary invasion of UFOs like that which occurred in what has
become known as &quot;The Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942.&quot; The Army
announced the approach of hostile aircraft and the city's air raid warning
system went into effect for the first time in World War II. The defense
to this &quot;attack&quot; is described in dramatic terms in the opening
paragraph of this chapter.</P>

<P>But what enemy had been routed? No one ever knew. All the fire fighters
saw in the sky were the 15 or 20 moving &quot;things&quot; which seemed
to change course at great speed apparently unaffected by the flak from
bursting shells all around them. Rumors that one had been shot down were
never verified, nor was the explanation that these zig-zagging invaders
were weather balloons ever taken seriously. In any event, for Chuck, that
unforgettable episode aroused a continuing interest in UFOs, rivaling his
professional fields of law and fire protection. The fact that he subsequently
was a member of a group whose sighting of a flight of UFOs was authenticated
by airport radar helped to sustain that interest.</P>

<P>UFO Background Information</P>

<P>With no intention of trying to prove or disprove the authenticity of
the numerous UFO encounters often related by very credible witnesses including
airline and military pilots, astronauts, police officers, fire fighters,
members of Congress, and even a U.S. President, the balance of this chapter
will present a brief history and nature of UFOs and their alleged occupants:
their propulsion origin, and possible motives for continuing reconnaissance.</P>

<P>A quick look at some of the classic accounts of encounters documented
in numerous foreign and U.S. publications might help us judge the magnitude
of their threat, if any, to social stability, and, if deemed desirable,
propose a fire service plan for coping with some of the conceivable catastrophic
effects that UFOs could produce on cities and densely populated areas.</P>

<P>For readers who already have made up their minds that there is no such
thing as a UFO notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence to the contrary,
it should be pointed out that there is circumstantial evidence that disastrous
effects have already been attributed to UFO activity in more than one nation,
including the United States.</P>

<P>UFOs-What Are They?</P>

<P>William Shakespeare put a fitting observation in the mouth of Hamlet,
the Prince of Denmark, that went like this: &quot;There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.&quot;
Whether Hamlet was referring to those strange lights or objects that appear
in the sky or near the ground and have no known cause, we will never know,
but the World Book Encyclopedia defines such things as UFOs. (37)</P>

<P>Several theories have been propounded as to what they might be. Some
scientists believe that they are of extraterrestrial origin-coming from
other planets. Military officers conjecture that they might be alien aircraft.
Some attribute them all to natural causes, such as meteors, comets, sun
dogs, light reflections, marsh gas, ball lighting, even though they must
admit that scientists cannot explain all UFO reports in that manner. Still
others are inclined to believe that they may be forms from other dimensions
which can materialize and dematerialize at will perhaps by making a wavelength
or frequency transition so as to become invisible to humans. Some believe
they are time travelers from the future.</P>

<P>UFO Classification System</P>

<P>Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northern University Professor Emeritus of Astronomy
and an advisor to the Air Force's Blue Book Project, adopted a very simple
classification system based solely upon the manner of observation:</P>

<P>1. Nocturnal lights 2. Daylight disks 3. Close encounters (day or night)
4. Radar readings.</P>

<P>He concluded that this system tells us nothing about the nature of the
UFOs, but can suggest a means for gathering data.(38) He found that while
a large number of such reports were readily identifiable by trained investigators
as misconceptions of known objects or events, a small residue (about 1,000)
were not. These came from credible witnesses from such widely separated
places as Canada, Australia, South America, and Antarctica. He concludes
with: &quot;Although I know of no hypothesis that adequately covers the
mountainous evidence, this should not and must not deter us from following
the advice of Schroedinger: to be curious, capable of being astonished,
and eager to find out.&quot; (39) Dr. Hynek has an excellence, well-illustrated
article on UFOs in a 1982 book which gives a detailed history of the UFO
sightings, together with the reports of some well-known people who made
them, including President Jimmy Carter while governor of Georgia. (40)</P>

<P>Shapes of UFOs</P>

<P>Witnesses have described the shapes of UFOs as anything varying from
a sphere to a boomerang. Some have resembled flying saucers with a lid:
others a glowing tube: some as semi-spherical with colored apertures: some
with reddish-orange glows, or fire-like or sparking discharges. Incredible
speed and maneuverabilities not attainable by aircraft of any kind are
commonly observed. Many of the books and articles in Appendix H have excellent
photographs of these unexplained visitors-photos that have been checked
by experts for their authenticity.</P>

<P>History of UFOs</P>

<P>For hundreds of years mysterious objects in the sky and strange moving
lights have been reported by many people, including the military pilots
in World War II who called them foo fighters. (&quot;Where there's Foo,
there's Fire&quot;). In the middle of the 1900s flying saucers were increasingly
observed in the United States and other countries. Scientists at the University
of Colorado hired by the Air Force from 1966 to 1968 to study this type
of aerial phenomena could explain most of the UFO reports as a star (Venus),
meteor, planet, balloon, rocket, artificial satellite, etc. Sometimes atmospheric
conditions, aircraft exhaust trails, or unusual lighting conditions may
produce optical illusions that observers thought were UFOs. After investigating
more than 12,000 reports, the U.S. Air Force was unable to explain where
the unexplained UFOs come from, but apparently concluded that the national
security was not threatened by them. (41) The emphasis of the university's
team headed by Edward U. Condon, seemed to be more concerned with the establishment
of the emotional stability or instability of those who reported the sightings
than with other evidence.</P>

<P>Psychiatrists have examined the witnesses who claimed to have encountered
UFOs and even been taken aboard their craft, such as the two shipyard workers
in Mississippi, and found that they are not unbalanced people. (42) &quot;They're
not crackpots. There was definitely something here that was not terrestrial.&quot;
(43)</P>

<P>Dr. J. Allen Hynek agreed, and added, &quot;Where they are coming from
and why they are here is a matter of conjecture, but the fact that they
were here on this planet is beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; (44)</P>

<P>The Air Force, after 20 years of being deluged with UFO sightings and
spending millions of dollars on their investigation, decided to drop the
inquiry business and turned the project over to a Kensington, Maryland,
group called NICAP (National Investigation Committee on Aerial Administration)
with part of the task of trying to run UFO sighting reports, including
many by its own Apollo and Skylab astronauts. By 1974 over a score of astronauts
saw and photographed UFOs during their flights beyond the earth's atmosphere.</P>

<P>Early in the Apollo II mission, which culminated in the moon walk, astronauts
Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins reported sightings of
what seemed to be a UFO during the first half of their flight to the lunar
surface. There were many more sightings by U.S. and Soviet Astronauts.
On November 11, 1966, Gemini XII Astronauts Jim Lovell and Edwin Aldrin
said that they saw four UFOs linked together, and on October 12, 1964,
three Russian astronauts aboard Voskod reported that they were surrounded
by a &quot;formation of fast-moving disc-shaped objects.&quot; (45)</P>

<P>UFO Organizations</P>

<P>In addition to NICAP, some of the other organizations that study UFO
phenomena are MUFON (Mutual UFO Networks), CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy),
GSW (Ground Saucer Watch), CUFOS (the Center for UFO Studies), and APRO
(Aerial Phenomena Research Organization), an Arizona nonprofit scientific
and educational organization, founded in 1952. (46)</P>

<P>Why the Secrecy?</P>

<P>In their book UFOs Over America, authors Jim and Carol Lorenzo charge
that the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) has been closely involved in
the collection and suppression of UFO information. &quot;Witnesses to the
phenomena have been bribed, coerced, and threatened by the CIA, who wanted
valuable evidence given to them alone.&quot; (47) One reason given is that
military intelligence may view the UFOs as a tool of either a known or
unknown potential enemy. &quot;If these vehicles prove evasive and surreptitious,
all the more reason to suspect them...the probability looms large that
the minds behind these vehicles may well be gathering intelligence of their
own.&quot; (48)</P>

<P>Another reason for secrecy may lie in the hope of obtaining knowledge
relating to advanced propulsion methods and anti-gravity systems before
other potential enemies on earth may acquire it. Hence, though many nations
are secretly investigating UFOs, they are reluctant to share their findings.
Robert Lofton, in his book Identified Flying Saucers, claims that the Air
Force became the &quot;goat&quot; in the effort of the CIA to debunk many
sightings by pilots, radar technicians, and reliable civilian observers.
He thinks that the suppression of information about how dangerous UFOs
can be is wrong. After citing a case where a child was burned over 50 to
60 percent of her body by a low flying UFO and then taken to an Air Force
hospital, no one would explain why her clothes were not burned at the same
time. He also describes another burn case in New Mexico and another man
who recently received a sledge-hammer like blow that knocked him unconscious
by the force field of a 100-foot diameter UFO. &quot;The public ought to
be told the danger! . . . Nothing helps rumors and panic more than ignorance.&quot;
(49)</P>

<P>Major Donald Kehoe describes in his book Aliens from Space, The Real
Story of Unidentified Flying Objects the difficulties he had in 1957 in
trying to get the truth from government agencies after he was director
of NICAP, the world's largest UFO research organization with over 30 subcommittees
in the U.S. and abroad. (50)</P>

<P>According to some UFOlogists the attempts at cover-up by the CIA extend
to destruction of evidence that it could not confiscate. Apparently some
of our nation's important leaders have been denied access to some UFO secrets
in the possession of an agency of the United States, the very existence
of which is classified above top secret. (51) Senator Barry Goldwater,
a retired Air Force Reserve Brigadier General and pilot with many decades
of flying experience, was quoted as saying &quot;I certainly believe in
aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings
that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities.&quot; He said he
was refused permission to check the Air Force files on UFOs and added.
&quot;I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going
on that we don't know about-and probably never will unless the Air Force
discloses them.&quot; (52) He said that he put faith in the reports of
the Air Force, Navy, and commercial pilots who reported instances where
a UFO would fly near them- right off their plane's wing-and then just zoom
away at incredible speeds. &quot;I remember the case in Georgia in the
1950s of a National Guard plane going after a UFO and never returning.
And I recall the case in Franklin, Kentucky, when four military planes
investigated a UFO. One of them exploded in midair and no one knows why.&quot;
(53)</P>

<P>Unleashed by the policy of Glasnost (greater openness) the Soviet media
felt free to include accounts of UFO sightings. A Tass report of October
10, 1989, reported a large shiny ball or disk hovering over a Voronezh
park; residents saw the UFO land and three creatures similar to human beings
emerged, accompanied by a robot. (54)</P>

<P>Apparently the Russians felt no need to suppress this report which was
poked fun at in Newsweek and Time magazines (55) but not in U.S. News and
World Report: &quot;A scant few decades ago, both the U.S. government and
the media treated flying objects as no laughing matter-which even Congress
looked into. In 1966 Representative Ford responded to a rash of sightings
in his home state of Michigan by calling for, and getting, a House hearing
on UFOs.&quot; (56)</P>

<P>UFO Missions</P>

<P>Many reasons have been advanced for the purpose of the UFOs visits to
our planet. Although some of the persons who apparently have been the subjects
of genetic investigation, such as the family of Whitley Streiber may not
agree, the majority of those who have studied possible UFO visitors feel
that they are friendly. Mr. Streiber described his experience as terrifying,
and believes that these &quot;little figures with eyes that seem to stare
into the deepest core of being are asking for something. Whatever it is,
it is more than simple information. The goal does not seem to be a sort
of clear and open exchange that we might expect; whatever may be surfacing,
it wants far more than that. It seems to me that it seeks the very depth
of soul; it seeks communion.&quot; (57)</P>

<P>From the thousands of reports he has studied, William Spaulding, aerospace
engineer and head of the Arizona-based Ground Saucer Watch, believes that
a pattern indicates that UFOs are here on a surveillance mission; the fact
that a majority of sightings occur around our military installations, research
and development areas leads to the conclusion that a methodical study is
being made of the earth and its defensive and offensive capabilities. &quot;The
phenomena is not unlike our own space explorations:scout ship survey: soil
samples: landing.&quot; (58)</P>

<P>In his book Incident at Exeter. John Fuller discusses the seemingly
affinity of UFOs for electrical power lines in the northeastern part of
the United States. In a later section of this chapter dealing with the
effects of UFOs on our terrestrial activities, we will see how this affinity
may have been responsible for causing 36 million people to lose power over
an area of 8,000 square miles. (59)</P>

<P>Because of our recent adventures into space, there are some who speculate
that UFOs are more concerned with what we will do there, than in settling
here. In any event, the Air Force's official publication (issued by the
Government Printing Office 1968) called Flying Objects says that &quot;No
UFO has been determined to represent a threat to our national security.&quot;
That conclusion, however should not rule out less disastrous consequences
than the overthrow of our government.</P>

<P>ADVERSE POTENTIAL OF UFOS</P>

<P>Regardless of its past evaluations, the Air Force could be wrong about
a number of things. &quot;It can't even guess within a couple of billion
dollars what one of its planes is going to cost: maybe, despite skepticism
of the scientists and other investigators, the UFOs sent from other planets
do exist and have visited earth.&quot; (60) And maybe they have exhibited
some destructive effects, whether or not intentionally in ever instance,
which we need to consider when drafting a plan for coping with an emergency
situation where UFOs are involved. Some of these documented effects are
as follows.</P>

<P>UFO Hazards</P>

<P>The two principal hazards noted with relation to UFOs have been attributed
to powerful electrical fields which they can project in a general populace
or individual contacts.</P>

<P>Force Field Impact</P>

<P>The disruption of air and ground travel has often been reported in the
presence of UFOs. The ignition systems of auto and aircraft engines have
apparently been affected by energized force fields to such an extent as
to stop their operation: the headlights and radios have also ceased to
function. Here are a couple of examples. In Buenos Aires, on March 29,
1978, &quot;A strange force shut off their engine and headlights of their
Citroen CG, lifted it 15 feet off the road, then set it down a minute later
and 75 miles to the north.&quot; The driver had noticed a yellow and violet
light shining in his rear view mirror while driving the last leg of a long
stock car race, and he realized that it was approaching too fast to be
a competitor. A month later a Colombian bank manager and a navy officer
had their car headlights go off when buzzed by a UFO, with the navy man
suffering temporary paralysis. Other South American countries in which
similar actions were reported around that time included Argentina, Chile,
Peru, and Uruguay. (61)</P>

<P>These effects have also been noted to influence the controls and instruments
of aircraft, e.g., the pilot of a Piper PH-24 reported that his controls
became inoperable when he was approached by three disk-shaped objects,
10 to 12 feet in diameter, over Mexico City on May 3, 1975. (62) Similar
cases have been reported by military pilots, illustrated by the classic
case of the near mid-air collision of an army helicopter with a UFO on
October 18, 1973, over Ohio, where not only did both the UHF and VHF radio
wavelengths go dead temporarily, but the downward movement of the helicopter
with its four occupants was levitated upward by a green beam from the UFO
in time to prevent its crash into the ground. (63)</P>

<P>Communications Disruption</P>

<P>In addition to the impedance of radio transmissions and reception, such
as that described in the preceding incident, telephone interference has
occurred, illustrated by the chagrin of President Lyndon Johnson in having
his conversation from the Texas White House cut off while talking to assistants
in Washington, D.C. (64) The ability to render inoperable all electronic
forms of communications, including those that control the launching of
defense weapons systems, has been considered within the range of UFO capability.
Whether this could extend to the erasing of recorded computer data such
as bank records, personnel data, FBI, CIA, and NSA files, along with critical
information of every kind, is not beyond the realm of possibility.</P>

<P>Regional Power Blackouts</P>

<P>It has long been suspected that UFOs have the capability of blacking
out a city, state, or many states by exerting a force field sufficient
to overload the circuits of public and private utility installations. &quot;Few
things are more disturbing than to be plunged into pitch darkness without
warning: it is dangerous for masses of people. It paralyzes cities, blocks
highways, stops trains, leaves elevators suspended between floors. In general
it simply plays hell with the modern way of life.&quot; (65) You would
think that the power companies would have achieved sufficient reliability
in their high tech systems that a mass failure such as that which blacked
out New York and New England in 1965 would never happen-but it did. Although,
as we have mentioned before, it was known that UFO activity was associated
with disturbances with compasses, instruments, ignition systems, radios,
etc., it was inconceivable that it could also interfere with generation
and disturbance of electrical power. Such a connection was also inferred
in November 1953, when a glowing red object went over a residential area
of New Haven, Connecticut, causing lights to dim out on both sides of the
object's path and them come on when it went out of sight.</P>

<P>Power failures were also reported in association with UFOs in Brazil
in 1957 to 1959, Rome, Italy, in 1958: and Mexico in 1965. Likewise, in
Uberlandia, where the power station operators promptly closed the circuits
when the UFO apparently caused them to open, it did no good, and they were
unable to restore the power until the UFO departed.</P>

<P>&quot;The Granddaddy of all blackouts to date was the stygian blanket
that fell over 30 million people in the northeastern corner of the U.S.
during the early evening rush hour period on November 9, 1965.&quot; (66)
Relay services that were supposed to automatically transfer the load in
case of failure in one area to an alternate source malfunctioned. Military
communications relying on public power without alternate backup systems
also failed, but communications were operable to make a quick public announcement
that there was no military emergency. Though it was largely over by the
next morning, the official explanation about a malfunctioning small device
in a Canadian hydroelectric generating plant never accounted for the failure
of millions of dollars worth of electronic devices to shift the load when
the breakdown occurred.</P>

<P>Fireballs Over Syracuse-The Blackout Connection</P>

<P>Airplane pilots reported that UFOs were being chased across Pennsylvania
about 4:30 P.M., and electronics and construction engineers about 5:30
P.M., just prior to the Great Blackout. A veteran flight instructor who
had been flying over Syracuse on a training flight say a glowing globe
over the power lines leading the Niagara Falls generating plant. Hundreds
of others saw the glowing object in the sky on the night of the big power
failure.</P>

<P>That was on November 9th. On December 2nd, about 700,000 persons in
Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico also had their power fail. It was said to
have originated in a regular failure in El Paso: then on December 5th,
three nights later, 40,000 homes plus military installations in the area
of East Texas were also blacked out-overloaded! Missile grounds (White
Sands), Fort Bliss, Holloman Air Force Base, and numerous airports were
all blacked out (with no emergency power backup), and this was when President
Johnson's telephone call to the White House in Washington D.C. was cut
off. In response to his request for an explanation, President Johnson was
told that his calls were fed into a cable system that went dead when the
surge of power caused by the El Paso regulator blow-up hit it, and the
backup batteries didn't work. Though it may be debatable whether the above
cases of electrical transmission failure were merely coincidences with
UFO activity, an incident on April 18, 1962, involving a UFO that had been
tracked from New York, through Kansas to Eureka, Utah, was well documented.
The Air Force spokesman admitted that the object had landed, and during
the 42 minutes that it was on the ground near the power station there was
no power, but it was restored when the UFO left. The object was pursued
by jet interceptors summoned from Phoenix and Stead Field in Reno until
it exploded over the Mesquite Range in Nevada in a brilliant glare that
was visible over five states. (67)</P>

<P>UFOs-The Panic Hazard</P>

<P>The second major disastrous effect that UFO activity, real or imagined,
can have on the populace, is the creation of fear, panic, flight, and all
kinds of irrational behavior. We have mentioned already the rather well-documented
case of hysterical contagion and mass hysteria created by War of the Worlds,
the radio drama by Orson Welles about an invasion of Martians. It was broadcast
on Halloween of 1938 during the period of the invasions of Germany into
Austria and Japan into China. &quot;The drama, realistically presented
in the form of news bulletins and interviews concerning an alien spaceship
landing in New Jersey, resulted in many kinds of hysterical actions, including
thousands of panic-stricken phone calls, wildly fleeing automobiles, and
impromptu shot gun brigades.&quot; (68)</P>

<P>Though most persons reporting UFOs do not interpret them as personal
threats, it is possible that some of the large volume of reports may be
attributable to hysterical contagion. In any case, one of the reasons often
cited for the tight secrecy on government UFO research findings is the
need to prevent the possible panic that a revelation of the truth might
arouse. Rumors that people were being abducted, dematerialized, burned,
made radioactive, rounded up and impounded, liquidated with ray guns and
lasers or shipped off to Mars or Venus might well give rise to fear-fear
of the unknown. Hysteria could cause frightened persons to imagine that
their water was poisoned, the air contaminated with undetectable but lethal
aerosols or nerve gases. With hundreds of UFO squadrons zooming across
the landscape from California to New York, Toronto to Mexico City, communications
disrupted, widespread power failures, airports and railroads paralyzed,
highways turned into giant parking lots of immobilized vehicles full of
terrified motorists, the problem of restoring order and sanity would be
a tremendous challenge to all of the emergency services, assuming their
personnel would remain calm, detached, and able to resist the human impulse
to put the safety and well being of their own families ahead of the public's.
To make matters worse, some of the more excitable gun owners might be tempted
to rush out Rambo fashion, and in utter disregard of the damage that falling
bullets might cause innocent residents below their fallout, start firing
at the evasive objects regardless of the range.</P>

<P>Personal Hazards-Physiological</P>

<P>The force field affects on the physical environment communication, transportation,
illumination, and computerized data storage-have already been considered.
We might have added that some physical effects have been observed at locations
where UFOs have landed-circular patterns of crops destroyed by heat or
radiation and baking or sterilization of the soil at the site.</P>

<P>On a more practical basis there may be grounds for concern that more
than just the environment can be adversely affected by UFO actions. While
pursuing UFOs, military aircraft have disappeared in mid-air, exploded,
and suffered harassment. Persons on the ground have sustained serious burns,
paralysis, and &quot;blows&quot; from a force field, radiated emissions,
or rays and beams that have been described like that of a &quot;stun-gun&quot;
(69)</P>

<P>In 1980, three witnesses saw a red ball of light hovering above houses
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when suddenly a bolt of blue light shot down
and two houses burst into flames. (70) An Indiana man saw a bright light
flash pass his window: the power went off in his house so he went outside
to investigate and found a brilliantly lit object hovering above him: when
he started to walk toward it his body commenced to tingle and he was unable
to move until the object disappeared. A similar tingling sensation swept
over another man in Lynn, Massachusetts, one night when he approached a
domed object with a red glowing cone rising from a parking lot. He too
was immobile until the object moved out of sight. Some believe that even
animals may be at risk by UFOs: in trying to account for the death of 15
ponies, the leader of an investigative team believed they were crushed
by the anti-gravity field of a flying saucer as it took off.(71)</P>

<P>Thus, UFOs may not only have the power to control some of our military
and industrial establishment's highly technical scientific hardware, they
may also possess the ability to impose pain and control over people who
attempt to attack them, even to the extent of &quot;liquidating&quot; them
in one way or another.</P>

<P>UFOS-EMERGENCY ACTION</P>

<P>In view of the fact that many UFOlogists believe that we are fast approaching
a time when overt landings of UFOs will become less remarkable, and in
the absence of our knowing whether their visits are friendly or hostile,
it would not be remiss to give some thought to the part that fire departments
might play in the event of the unexpected arrival of UFOs in their communities.
For example, what would be your course of action as an incident commander
at the scene of a school ground where a UFO has crashed into the boiler
room, rupturing a fuel line, and ignition has occurred in the spilling
oil, endangering the occupants of the craft who are trapped in the wreckage?
If your rescue attempts are successful, and two of the five small alien
creatures are injured but still alive, how do you dispose of the dead and
treat the survivors? How would the presence of children on the school grounds
affect your actions? What persons and agencies would be notified?</P>

<P>The authors have never read any advice on these matters. The following
admonition was printed on the inside from jacket of Frank Edward's book
on flying saucers:</P>

<P>WARNING</P>

<P>&quot;Near approaches of UFOs can be harmful to human beings. Do not
stand under a UFO that is hovering at low altitude. Do not touch or attempt
to touch a UFO that has landed. In either case the safe thing to do is
to get away from there very quickly and let the military take over. There
is a possibility of radiation danger and there are known cases where persons
have been burned by rays emanating from UFOs. Don't take chances with UFOs!&quot;</P>

<P>In view of the federal law (cited earlier) empowering NASA's administrator
to impound, without a hearing, anyone who touches a UFO or its occupants,
it would be inadvisable to make personal contact unless you are willing
to submit to NASA's quarantine requirements, should the law be invoked.</P>

<P>Besides the possible physical effects of approaching a UFO, e.g., burns,
radiation, etc., there may be psychological effects produced by force fields
that could induce a hypnotic states in the viewer, loss of consciousness,
memory relapse, and submission to the occupants. Jacques Valle, author
of The Invisible College cautions that we should consider psychic effects,
such as space-time distortions experienced by percipients of craft-like
devices which appear to fade away-dematerialize-and then reappear: of alien,
strange voices or thoughts that may effect involuntary changes in the manner
in which witnesses may react in such circumstances. (72)</P>

<P>Perhaps the above warning of Edwards and Vallee are a little too cautious
and apprehensive to adopt as a general pattern of conduct in every situation.
In the absence of overt acts indicating hostility, there may be no danger
in approaching a landing (or landed) UFO with a positive, solicitous attitude
of wanting to be of service. This nonaggressive mental state may be telepathically
sensed by those aboard or emerging from the craft: a form of non vocal
communication is a possibility. It goes without saying that any display
of firearms or other weapons on your part could be construed as unfriendly
and likely to thwart your intention of conveying a helpful attitude.</P>

<P>In a best case scenario, you may be able to obtain guidance as to the
appropriate actions to take, whether of a life-saving nature, e.g., in
quelling a fire, abating a spill, and of preservation of property, or even
in the reduction of apprehension on the part of your response team and
the spectators.</P>

<P>In a less optimistic scenario, you may have engine trouble upon approaching
the scene, and radio contact could be lost with your dispatcher. If at
night, your headlights could go out, the city could be blacked out, and
your portable generators may malfunction when you attempt to use them for
fans and portable lights. It would certainly be an inopportune time for
your comrades to announce that they had decided to take their pensions,
effective immediately.</P>

<P>In any event, the incident could provide invaluable experience for further
training in coping with rare and difficult emergencies. Whatever &quot;inside&quot;
information you are able to pass along to your fellow officers and citizens
of the world might help to alleviate unreasonable fear, so that there would
be less likelihood that we would ever again experience the panic and hysteria
that was created by War of the Worlds a half century ago. Truth is the
best cure for the unknown. A list of some of the available books on Unidentified
Flying Objects (UFOs) is found in Appendix H.</P>

<P>CONCLUSION</P>

<P>Some fire chiefs have little confidence in disaster plans, especially
those dealing with UFOs or enemy attack. If you develop a plan that sets
forth your responsibilities, resources, organizations, supplies, information,
telephone numbers, and special data that will be useful in obtaining help
and fulfilling your role in disaster control, commit it to an electronic
medium, a computer with a capability for continuous updating through modern
word processing. Bring it forth when the need requires. With a good plan,
good leadership, and adequate resources, you may save many lives in any
disaster, including attack from possible enemies.</P>

<P>ARTICLE <A NAME="5"></A>5</P>

<P>THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON</P>

<P>UFOlogists Go Political</P>

<P>Editor s Note: UFOlogists from across the nation grabbed picket signs
and took to the streets of Washington to let the U.S. government know that
they are tired of the secrecy surrounding UFOs and don't plan to take it
any longer.</P>

<P>A group of about 100 protested in the 98 degree heat of July 5th and
were led by a relatively new organization called &quot;The Right to Know,&quot;
organized for the sole purpose of making the voices of &quot;reason&quot;
heard within the halls of Congress. Directed by Ed Komarek of Thomasville,
Georgia, the group met directly across the street from the White House
in a neighboring park to listen to speeches from luminaries in the field,
including the likes of Fate magazine columnist and UFO Universe Contributing
Editor Antonio Huneeus, long time UFO research veteran Larry Bry. UFOs
converged on White House during flap of 1952, though it did nothing to
convince the Pentagon that they should &quot;come clean&quot; on a matter
of a massive cover-up. This is an office photo of the radar screen at Washington
International Airport showing the objects as they converge on their target.</P>

<P>Bry, who has waged a one-man war against Capital Hill's UFO censorship
policy, and yours truly, who reminded the eager protesters that this was
not the first time the subject of flying saucers were of particular attention
to those living in the District of Columbia. I reminded those attending
the rally that back in 1952 strange objects were seen for several days
in a row coming and going over the White House, were picked up on radar,
and were chased by our fastest planes at the time. Even President Truman
took to the airwaves to tell the nation's frightened citizenry not to worry,
that the Air Force was doing its job. Truman--like other presidents before
and since--downplayed the seriousness of the situation and dismissed UFOs
as hallucinations and hoaxes.</P>

<P>But times have changed. And it looks like Operation Right to Know may
be the first successful group to take to the streets to protest what they
see as a grand cosmic whitewash that has involved the last eight presidents.
Those wishing to learn more about the forthcoming activities of the Right
to Know group should contact Ed Komarek at Route 3, Box 1076, Thomasville,
GA 31792. And, by the way, donations are welcome to support the cause just
like they would be to any charitable group.</P>

<P>If the leadership of the UFO community lacks the courage, assertiveness
and spunk needed to end the UFO cover-up quickly then they should step
aside and make way for others that will. If this does not happen, then
they will be superseded by new organizations and new leaders. This is,
in fact, already happening around the country as memberships grow tired
of all the fussing and squabbling and the mutual admiration societies that
exist within the UFO establishment.</P>

are led by abductes Minder Gerber and Pat Marcattilio.</P>

<P>Why We Marched by Ed Komarek</P>

<P>The spectacular success of Operation Right to Know's second annual UFO
demonstration in Washington, DC shows what a few committed people can do.
Unfortunately, the demonstration would have been a bigger success if the
UFO community had not undermined our efforts in this regard. The UFO establishment
has become extremely conservative and unwilling to experiment and take
risks. It seems that the leaders of the UFO establishment prefer to sit
on their laurels content to hold on to what they have accomplished so far.
Even worse, they undermine the efforts of others like ORTK who are willing
to experiment, take risks and learn from both the successes and failures.
It was very irresponsible for the UFO establishment to come down against
demonstrating when it had never been done before.</P>

<P>It seems to me that the leaders of the UFO establishment have failed
to learn from their adversaries who know that the media are the eyes and
ears of the public. The battle for freedom of inquiry by the public is
carried out in the media. It is essential to get the media on our side
in order to get our message to the public. This message is to look at the
evidence. If the people will not look at the evidence because of the debunking
groups and the tabloid press, then what good is the evidence. If the UFO
establishment is really serious about ending the UFO cover-up, they must
realize that the UFO/ET problem is first and foremost a political problem,
and thus deserves a political solution. What good is science if the data
is being manipulated because of politics.</P>

<P>I suggest that the various UFO groups get together immediately and form
a public relations committee to publicize the evidence.</P>

<P>First and foremost on this committee's agenda should be to publicize
an event like &quot;UFO Awareness Week&quot; by distributing press releases
to every media source in the country about three weeks before the event.
Speakers should be lined up to talk to the press and present the evidence
for UFO/ET's and the massive UFO cover-up. Operation Right To Know has
taken the lead and now it is up to the UFO community to follow that leadership.
We need aggressive, assertive leadership that stands up to irresponsible
reporting on the UFO/ET situation by the media.</P>

<P>Our demonstration in front of the Washington Post protesting their unwillingness
to look at the evidence while attempting to make ORTK out to be a radical
organization put them in their place. As expected, a competitor paper,
the Wall Street Journal, ran an article that forced the Washington Post
to admit Surrounded by picket signs, Tim Biweekly addresses the multitude
from a stage directly across the street from Bill Clinton's home as reporter
Hal MacKinsey looks on.</P>

<P>that the evidence was provocative and they were looking into the UFO/ET
matter. This should be an example to the UFO community not to roll over
and play dead when ridiculed in the press. ORTK again has taken a leadership
position and the UFO community should begin to aggressively deal with irresponsible
reporting by the press.</P>

<P>If the leadership of the UFO community lacks the courage, assertiveness
and spunk needed to end the UFO cover-up quickly then they should step
aside and make way for others that will. If this does not happen, then
they will be superseded by new organizations and new leaders. This is,
in fact, already happening around the country as memberships grow tired
of all the fussing and squabbling and the mutual admiration societies that
exist within the UFO establishment.</P>

<P>ORTK will continue to use all means possible that are legal and non-disruptive
to end the UFO cover-up. We will do this with or without the support of
the UFO establishment. Obviously we would like the overwhelming support
of the UFO community. ORTK has just begun a long process that is essentially
a civil rights movement. Like the civil rights movement for the freedom
of black people that began when a few individuals stood up for their rights,
so are we of ORTK doing the same. Both movements have arisen out of a simmering
discontent that a few courageous individuals catalyzed into political action.</P>

<P>From Truman to Clinton: Presidents and Cosmic Watergate</P>

<P>by Dan Pinchas</P>

<P>In light of President Clinton's recent inauguration, it is worth reviewing
what evidence exists concerning our presidents' knowledge of&quot;the cosmic
Watergate&quot;. Due to the extremely high level of secrecy concerning
the U.S. investigation of UFOs and &quot;IACs&quot; (Identified Alien Crafts),
it is difficult to verify some of this information, much of which is anecdotal.</P>

<P>This information is culled from a variety of published and unpublished
sources. The following is a brief sketch of presidential involvement in
and knowledge of the UFO cover-up.</P>

<P>Truman, Eisenhower, and Roswell</P>

<P>The documents which, if genuine, prove that President Truman was aware
of the recovery of crashed alien spacecraft are at the center of a controversy.
The Truman-Forrestal memorandum of September 24, 1947, if legitimate, would
establish conclusively that Truman established Operation Majestic-12 to
analyze bodies and wreckage recovered from the Roswell UFO crash. Truman
had been quoted as expressing the view that UFOs were real and otherworldly
in origin.</P>

<P>The alleged Eisenhower MJ-12 Briefing Document of November 18, 1952
would indicate that then President-elect Eisenhower was made aware of the
Roswell crash and possibly other crashes.</P>

<P>Of particular interest are allegations that Eisenhower encountered aliens
at Muroc Airfield (Edwards AFB) on Feb The Truman-Forrestal memorandum
of September 24,1947, if legitimate, would establish conclusively that
Truman established Operation Majestic-12 to analyze bodies and wreckage
recovered from the Roswell UFO crash. Truman had been quoted as expressing
the view that UFOs were real and other-worldly in origin.</P>

<P>A former steward on Air Force One during the Kennedy years has claimed
that he discussed UFOs with Kennedy during a flight in December 1962, and
that Kennedy told him his hands were tied and the whole matter was out
of his hands.</P>

<P>February 20, 1954 as cited in the Gerald Light letter of April 16, 1954,
where Light claims &quot;etherians&quot; and &quot;otherplane aeroforms&quot;
presented themselves. A test pilot who claimed to be present told Britain's
Brinsley Le Poet Trench (Lord Clancarty), that Eisenhower witnessed a demonstration
of technology and power that included a craft and aliens dematerializing
before his eyes, causing Eisenhower great embarrassment. He is alleged
to have told the visitors that &quot;the world is not ready for you.&quot;</P>

<P>Some researchers believe Eisenhower allowed executive power to slip
from the Presidency to MJ12, but there is no concrete evidence to support
this.</P>

<P>JFK: A Would-be Whistleblower?</P>

<P>A former steward on Air Force One during the Kennedy years has claimed
that he discussed UFOs with Kennedy during a flight in December 1962. Kennedy
told him his hands were tied, the whole matter was out of his hands.</P>

<P>A highly controversial claim has been put forth by an Air Force intelligence
source claiming Kennedy informed former Eisenhower national security advisor
and reputed MJ- 12 member Gordon Gray in a taped 1963 meeting that he intended
to publicize the alien presence against MJ-12's wishes. The source denied
this was a reason that led to Kennedy's assassination in a covert operation.</P>

<P>While considerable evidence exists of CIA involvement in the assassination
(see Mark Lane, Plausible Denial), there is no concrete evidence supporting
a UFO connection. There is also no available evidence indicating that President
Johnson evinced any knowledge of the UFO cover-up. It is interesting to
note, however, that the alleged landing of an alien craft at Holloman AFB
in April 1964 and conclusion of a government alien agreement would have
occurred in the first months of Johnson's term.</P>

<P>Nixon Knew. Two sources allege President Nixon indicated knowledge of
the UFO coverup. Robert Emenegger, a film producer, was invited to visit
Norton AFB to discuss a documentary on UFOs, which was to incorporate footage
of the abovementioned 1964 alien craft landing at Holloman AFB. Emenegger
allegedly was shown a directive signed by Nixon authorizing release of
the Holoman AFB film, which, needless to say, never was released. When
he broached the subject with White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman,
Haldeman acknowledged familiarity with the Holloman landing but then quickly
changed the subject.</P>

<P>A second source is Beverly McKittrick, comedian Jackie Gleason's second
wife, who said Gleason accompanied his friend Nixon to Homestead AFB in
1973, where he was shown alien bodies in storage. According to McKittrick,
Gleason was visibly shaken by this experience, but would neither confirm
nor deny the report when questioned by others.</P>

<P>Ford Disappointment.</P>

<P>As a Congressman in 1966, Gerald Ford supported a Congressional committee
investigation of the UFO phenomenon. Congressional hearings were held but
accomplished little.</P>

<P>Speculation abounded (fanned by leaks from government sources) that
President Ford, while holding a summit with French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in Martinique in December 1974, would issue a statement on the
UFO reality, but no statement was released.</P>

<P>Ford responded to a recent inquiry regarding his opinion of UFOs that
his &quot;position hasn't changed.&quot;</P>

<P>Carter Breaks Promise.</P>

<P>President Carter acknowledged seeing a UFO while governor of Georgia
in 1969. During the 1976 election campaign, Carter said, &quot;If I become
President, I'll make every piece of information this country has about
UFO's available to the public and the scientists.&quot; This campaign promise
was not honored.</P>

<P>One reason for this might be an alleged UFO briefing document which
intelligence agents allowed researcher Bill Moore to photograph in 1983.
This document, dated June 14, 1977, contained transcribed notes allegedly
used to brief Carter on Project Aquarius and the UFO/IAC investigation.
A similar document was shown to documentary filmmaker Linda Howe by AFOSI
Special Agent Richard Doty, also in 1983.</P>

<P>It is not possible to determine whether the material is genuine, but
it is likely some type of briefing was provided to Carter relating to UFOs
which caused him to change his mind about public disclosure. A request
by Las Vegas TV anchor George Knapp to interview A highly controversial
claim has been put forth by an Air Force intelligence source claiming Kennedy
informed former Eisenhower national security advisor and reputed MJ-12
member Gordon Gray in a taped 1963 meeting that he intended to publicize
the alien presence against MJ-12's wishes.</P>

<P>The source denied this was a reason that led to Kennedy's assassination
in a covert operation.</P>

<P>Carter regarding this matter several years ago was declined.</P>

<P>Navy physicist Robert Lazar claims to have read briefing documents while
employed at Area 51/S-4 in Nevada describing a clash at an underground
base at Groom Lake between grays and U.S. military personnel in which 22
members of security forces units and 44 government scientists were allegedly
killed (along with an unspecified number of gray casualties). If this 1979
incident did indeed occur, it transpired during the Carter Administration.
There has been no independent verification of the alleged incident.</P>

<P>Reagan a Believer</P>

<P>President Reagan also saw a UFO in 1974 while Governor of California,
a fact he acknowledged in subsequent interviews. Film Producer Steven Spielberg
has told friends that during a private screening of the movie E.T. at the
White House in 1982, Reagan told him that they were among a handful of
people who knew how true it was.</P>

<P>Of greater significance is Reagan's repetition on five separate occasions,
including a 1985 Geneva summit with Soviet President Gorbachev, of the
theme that the nations of the planet would unite if facing an extraterrestrial
threat. When Gorbachev was asked at a summit news conference if he shared
Reagan's views, he responded affirmatively.</P>

<P>Bush: A UFO Insider?</P>

<P>It has been alleged, without evidence, that former Director of Central
Intelligence Bush was Director of MJ-12 in the Reagan Administration. It
is similarly alleged that Vice President Dan Quayle was Director of MJ-12
during the Bush Administration.</P>

<P>Robert Lazar, who allegedly worked as a physicist on nine recovered
(or donated) UFOs at Area 51/S-4, has stated his belief that Bush was familiar
with the project Lazar was working on. Researcher Jorge Martin has reported
that Bush as Vice President visited the remote Cabo Rojo area in Puerto
Rico where UFOs are frequently sighted and where abductees have reportedly
being abducted by grays acting in collusion with U.S. military personnel.
It has been alleged that an underground base may exist in the vicinity.
with U.S. military personnel. It has been alleged that an underground base
may exist in the vicinity. Russian UFOlogist Marina Popovich was told by
senior advisors to former Soviet President Gorbachev that he and Bush discussed
the disappearance of the unmanned Soviet spacecraft Phobos II in orbit
around Mars at their 1989 summit conference in Malta. Contact was lost
with Phobos II after it sent back pictures of a huge 12.5 mile long elliptical
UFO orbiting around the Mars moon of Phobos.</P>

<P>Will Clinton Follow Tradition?</P>

<P>Past experience strongly indicates that President Clinton and Vice President
Gore will receive, or have already received, briefings on the alien presence
on Earth. Precedent also indicates that Clinton is unlikely to make the
information public unless MJ- 12 (or its equivalent under a different name)
is in agreement.</P>

<P>Every President since Truman appears to have had knowledge of UFO secrets
and yet none has made the information public. If Operation Right to Know
is successful, this pattern of silence and cover-up will be broken for
good.</P>

<P>WELCOME ABOARD This publication marks the 25th anniversary of the Third

biological war- fare, fought with &quot;silent weapons.' This book contains
an introductory description of this war, its strategies, and its weaponry.

<P>SECURITY It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or
the automat- ion of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation
systems (SILENT WEAPONS) on a NATIONAL or WORLDWIDE SCALE without implying
extensive OBJECTIVES of SOCIAL CONTROL and DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN LIFE, i.e.,
SLAVERY and GENOCIDE. This manual is in itself an analog declaration of
intent. Such a writing must be SECURED FROM PUBLIC SCRUTINY. Otherwise,
it might be recognized as a TECHNICALLY FORMAL DECLARATION OF DOMESTIC
WAR. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in a position
of great power and WITHOUT FULL KNOWLEDGE and CONSENT OF THE PUBLIC, USES
SUCH KNOWLEDGE and METHODOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC CONQUEST- it must be understood
that A STATE OF DOMESTIC WARFARE EXISTS between said person or group of
persons and the public. The SOLUTION of today's PROBLEMS REQUIRES an approach
which is RUTHLESSLY CANDID, with NO AGONIZING OVER RELIGIOUS, MORAL or
CULTURAL VALUES. YOU have QUALIFIED for this project BECAUSE of your ABILITY
to LOOK at HUMAN SOCIETY with COLD OBJECTIVITY, and yet analyze and DISCUSS
your OBSERVATIONS and CONCLUSIONS with OTHERS of similar INTELLECTUAL capacity
WITHOUT a LOSS of DISCRETION or HUMILITY. Such virtues are exercised in
your own best interest. Do not deviate from them.</P>

<P>WC/Author's Note:All above emphasis are mine as are those in the following
two sections and including bracketed additions throughout.</P>

<P>I do recognize this document, based upon the document's own admission,
as a formal Declaration of War by the Illuminati upon the citizens of the
United States of America. I acknowledge that a State of War exists and
has existed between the Citizens of the United States of America and the
Illuminati aggressor based upon this recognition. I present to you that
the peaceful Citizens of this nation are fully justified in taking whatever
steps may be necessary, including violence, to identify, counterattack,
and destroy the enemy. I base this statement upon the God-given right of
any peaceful people</P>

<P>to defend themselves against attack and destruction by any enemy waging
war against them. I cite the principles outlined in the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution of the United States of America, and the
fully recognized and acknowledged historical precedents that have served
as the justification for destruction of tyrants.</P>

<P>HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION Silent weapon technology has evolved from Operations
Research (O.R.), a strategic and tactical methodology developed under the
MILITARY MANAGEMENT (Eisenhower) in England during World War II. the original
purpose of Operations Research was to study the strategic and tactical
problems of air and land defense with the objective of effective use of
limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e.,logistics). It
was soon recognized by those in positions of power [THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN
RELATIONS] that the same methods might be useful for totally controlling
a society. But better tools were necessary. Social engineering (the analysis
and automation of a society) requires the correlation of great amounts
of constantly changing economic information (data), so a high-speed computerized
data-processing systems was necessary which could race ahead of the society
and predict when society would arrive for capitulation. Relay computers
were too slow, but the electronic computer, invented in 1946 by J. Presper
Eckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill. The next breakthrough was
the development of the simplex method of linear programming in 1947 by
the mathematician George B. Dantzig. Then in 1948, the transistor, invented
by J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain, and W. Shockley, promised great expansion
of the computer field by reducing space and power requirements. With these
three inventions under their direction, those in positions of power strongly
suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole world with
the push of a button. Immediately, the ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION got in on
the ground floor by making a four-year grant to HARVARD COLLEGE, funding
the HARVARD ECONOMIC RESEARCH PROJECT for the study of the structure of
the American economy. One year later, in 1949, THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
joined in. In 1952 the original grant period terminated, and a high-level
meeting of the ELITE [Illuminati] was held to determine the next phase
of social operations research. The Harvard project had been very fruitful,
as is borne out by the publication of some of its results in 1953 suggesting
the feasibility of economic (social) engineering. (Studies in the Structure
of the American Economy--copyright 1953 by Wassily Leontief, International
Sciences Press Inc., White Plains, New York.) Engineered in the last half
of the decade of the 1940s, the new Quiet War machine stood, so to speak,
in sparkling gold-plated hardware on the showroom floor by 1954. With the
creation of the maser in 1954, the promise of unlocking UN LIMITED SOURCES
OF FUSION ATOMIC ENERGY FROM THE HEAVY HYDROGEN IN SEA WATER and the consequent
availability of unlimited social power was a possibility only decades away.
The combination was irresistible. The QUIET WAR was quietly DECLARED by
the INTERNATIONAL ELITE [THE BILDERBERG GROUP] at a meeting held in 1954.
Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later, the
evolution of the new weapon-system has never suffered any major setbacks.
This volume marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the Quiet War.
Already this domestic war has had many victories on many fronts throughout
the world.</P>

<P>POLITICAL INTRODUCTION</P>

<P>In 1954 it was well recognized by those in positions of authority that
it was only a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general public
would be able to grasp and upset the cradle of power, for the very elements
of the new silent-weapon technology were as accessible for a public utopia
as they were for providing a private utopia. The ISSUE of PRIMARY CONCERN,
that of DOMINANCE, revolved around the subject of the energy sciences.</P>

<P>ENERGY</P>

<P>Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science
is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science,
theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control
of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore,
mathematics is the primary energy science. And the book- keeper can be
king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping.
All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end
is control. [THE END ALWAYS JUSTIFIES THE MEANS.] Beyond this remains only
one issue: Who will be the beneficiary? In 1954 this was the issue of concern.
Although the so- called &quot;moral issues&quot; were raised, in view of
the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people
who will not use their intellegence are no better than animals who do not
have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table
by choice and consent. CONSEQUENTLY, in the interest of future world order,
peace, and tranquility, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against
the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting
the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible
many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few.
In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure,
and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons
so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public
appearance as to earn for themselves the name &quot;silent weapons.&quot;
In conclusion, the objective of economic research, as conducted by the
magnates of capital (banking) and the industries of commodities (goods)
and services, is the establishment of an economy which is totally predict-
able and manipulatable. In order to achieve a totally predictable economy,
the low-class elements of the society must be brought under total control,
i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social
duties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity to question
the propriety of the matter. In order to achieve such conformity, the lower-
class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation
of the parents and the establishment of government-operated day-care centers
for the occupationally orphaned children. The quality of education given
to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so the moat of ignorance
isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains incomprehensible
to the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower
class individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves from
their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essential to maintaining
some measure of social order, peace, and tranquility for the ruling upper
crust.</P>

<P>DESCRIPTIVE INTRODUCTION OF THE SILENT WEAPON</P>

<P>Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from
a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning.
It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing,</P>

<P>instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data,
instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated
by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a
banking magnate, instead of a military general. It makes no obvious explosive
noises, causes no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously
interfere with anyone's daily social life. Yet it makes an unmistakable
&quot;noise,&quot; causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and
unmistakably interferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to a
trained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot comprehend
this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked
and subdued by a weapon. The public might instinctively feel that something
is wrong [ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH?], but because of the technical nature of
the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way,
or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how
to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend
themselves against it. When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public
adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment
on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes
tot great and they crack up. Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of
biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the
individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking
their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental,
and emotional strengths and weaknesses.</P>

<P>THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION Give me control over a nation's currency, and
I care not who makes its laws. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812)</P>

<P>Today's silent weapons technology is an outgrowth of a simple idea discovered,
succinctly expressed, and effectively applied by the quoted Mr. Mayer Amschel
Rothschild. Mr. Rothschild discovered the missing passive component of
economic theory known as economic inductance. He, of course, did not think
of his discovery in these 20th century terms, and , to be sure, mathematical
analysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Revolution, the rise of
the electronic computer before it could be effectively applied in the control
of the world economy.</P>

<P>GENERAL ENERGY CONCEPTS</P>

<P>In the study of energy systems, there always appear three elementary
concepts. These are potential energy, kinetic energy, and energy dissipation.
And corresponding to these concepts, there are three idealize, essentially
pure physical counterparts called passive components. (1) In the science
of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of potential energy is associated
with a physical property called elasticity or stiffness, and can be represented
by a stretched spring. In electronic science, potential energy is stored
in a capacitor instead of a spring. This property is called capacitance
instead of elasticity or stiffness. (2)In the science of physical mechanics,
the phenomenon of kinetic energy is associated with a physical property
called inertia or mass, and can be represented by a mass of a flywheel
in motion. In electronic science, kinetic energy is stored in an inductor
(in a magnetic field) instead of mass. This property is called inductance
in- stead of inertia. (3)In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon
of energy</P>

<P>dissipation is associated with a physical property called friction or
resistance, and can be represented by a dashpot or other device which converts
system energy into heat. In electronic science, dissipation of energy is
performed by an element called either a resistor or a conductor, the term
&quot;resistor&quot; being the one generally used to express the concept
of friction, and the term &quot;conductor&quot; being generally used to
describe a more ideal device (e.g., wire) employed to convey electronic
energy efficiently from one location to another. The property of a resistance
or conductor is measured as either resistance or conductance reciprocals.
In economics these three energy concepts are associated with: (1)Economic
Capacitance-Capital (money, stock/inventory, investments in buildings and
durables, etc. ) (2)Economic Conductance-Goods (production flow coefficients)
(3)Economic Inductance-Services (the influence of the population of industry
on output) All of the mathematical theory developed in the study of one
energy system (e.g., mechanics, electronics, etc.) can be immediately applied
in the study of any other energy system (e.g., economics).</P>

<P>MR. ROTHSCHILD'S ENERGY DISCOVERY</P>

<P>What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power,
influence, and control over people as applied to economics. That principle
is &quot;when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it to
you.&quot; Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan
accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to INDUCE
PEOPLE [WC emphasis] (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic
field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of
greater wealth (instead of real compensation). They would put up real collateral
in exchange for a loan of promissory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that he
could issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone's
stock of gold as a persuader to show to his customers. Mr. Rothschild loaned
his promissory notes to individuals and to governments. These would create
overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of the
system, and collect the collateral through the obligation of contracts.
The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a
war. Then he would control the avail- ability of currency to determine
who would win the war. That government which agreed to give him control
of its economic system got his support. Collection of debts was guaranteed
by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit derived from this
economic methodology made Mr. Rothschild all the more able to extend his
wealth. He found that the public greed would allow currency to be printed
by government order BEYOND THE LIMITS [WC emphasis] (inflation) of backing
in precious metal or the production of goods and services (gross national
product, GNP).</P>

<P>APPARENT CAPITAL AS &quot;PAPER&quot; INDUCTOR</P>

<P>In this structure, credit, presented as a pure element called &quot;currency,&quot;
has the appearance of capital, but is, in fact, negative capital. Hence,
it has the appearance of service, but is, in fact, indebtedness or debt.
It is there- fore an economic inductance instead of an economic capacitance,
and if balanced in no other way, will be balanced by the negotiation of
population (war, genocide)&gt; The total goods and services represent real
capital called the gross national product, and currency may be printed
up to this level and still represent economic capacitance; but currency
printed beyond this level is subtractive, represents the introduction of
economic inductance, and constitutes notes of indebtedness. War is therefore
the balancing of the system by killing the true creditors (the public which
we have taught to exchange true value for</P>

<P>inflated currency) and falling back on whatever is left of the resources
of nature and regeneration of those resources. Mr. Rothschild had discovered
that currency gave him the power to rearrange the economic structure to
his own advantage, to shift economic inductance to those economic positions
which would encourage the great- est economic instability and oscillation.
The final key to economic control had to wait until there was sufficient
data and high-speed computing equipment to keep close watch on the economic
oscillations created by price stocking and excess paper energy credits-
paper inductance/inflation.</P>

<P>BREAKTHROUGH</P>

<P>The aviation field provided the greatest evolution in economic engineering
by way of the mathematical theory of shock testing. In this process, a
projectile is fired from an airframe on the ground and the impulse of the
recoil is monitored by vibration transducers connected to the airframe
and wired to chart recorders. By studying the echoes or reflections of
the recoil impulse in the airframe, it is possible to discover critical
vibrations in the structure of the airframe which either vibrations of
the engine or aeolian vibrations of the wings, or a combination of the
two, might reinforce resulting in a resonant self-destruction of the airframe
in flight as an aircraft. From the standpoint of engineering, this means
that the strengths and weaknesses of the structure of the airframe in terms
of vibrational energy can be discovered and manipulated.</P>

<P>APPLICATION IN ECONOMICS</P>

<P>To use this method of airframe shock testing in economic engineering,
the prices of commodities are shocked, and the public consumer reaction
is monitored. The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted
theoretically by computers and the psycho-economic structure of the economy
us thus discovered. It is by this process that partial differential and
difference matrices are discovered that define the family household and
make possible its evaluation as an economic industry (dissipative consumer
structure). Then the response of the household to future shocks can be
predicted and manipulated, and society becomes a well-regulated animal
with its reins under the control of a sophisticated computer-regulated
social energy bookkeeping system. Eventually every individual element of
the structure comes under computer control trough a knowledge of personal
preferences, such know- ledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer
preferences (universal product code--UPC-- zebra-stripe pricing codes on
packages) with identified consumers (identified via association with the
use of a credit card and LATER A PERMANENT &quot;TATTOOED&quot; BODY NUMBER
[WC emphasis] invisible under normal ambient illumination...</P>

<P>THE ECONOMIC MODEL</P>

<P>...The Harvard Economic Research Project (1948-) was an extension of
World War II Operations Research. Its purpose was to discover the science
of controlling an economy: at first the American economy, and then the
world economy. It was felt that with sufficient mathematical foundation
and data, it would be nearly as easy to predict and control the trend of
an economy as to predict and control the trajectory of a projectile. Such
has proven to be the case. Moreover, the economy has been transformed into
a guided missile on target. The immediate aim of the Harvard project was
to discover the economic structure, what forces change that structure,
how the behavior of the</P>

<P>structure can be predicted, and how it can be manipulated. What was
needed was a well-organized knowledge of the mathematical structures and
interrelationships of investment, production, distribution, and consumption.</P>

<P>To make a short story of it all, it was discovered that an economy obeyed
the same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical theory and
practical and computer know-how developed for the electronic field could
be directly applied in the study of economics. This discovery was not openly
declared, and its more subtle implications were and are kept a closely
guarded secret, for example that in an economic model, human life is measured
in dollars, and that the electric spark generated when opening a switch
connected to an active inductor is mathematically analogous to the initiation
of a war. The greatest hurdle which theoretical economists faced was the
accurate description of the household as an industry. This is a challenge
because consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is influenced
by income, price, and other economic factors. This hurdle was cleared in
an indirect and statistically approximate was by an application of shock
testing to determine the current characteristics, called current technical
coefficients, of a household industry. Finally, because problems in theoretical
economics can be translated very easily into problems in theoretical electronics,
and the solution translated back again, it follows that only a book of
language translation and concept definition needed to be written for economics.
The remainder could be gotten from standard works on mathematics and electronics.
This makes the publication of books on advanced economics unnecessary,
and greatly simplifies project security.</P>

<P>INDUSTRIAL DIAGRAMS</P>

<P>An ideal industry is defined as a device which receives value from other
industries in several forms and converts [it] into one specific product
for sales and distribution to other industries. It has several inputs and
one output. What the public normally thinks of as one industry is really
an industrial complex where several industries under one roof produce one
or more products...</P>

<P>THREE INDUSTRIAL CLASSES</P>

<P>Industries fall into three categories or classes by type of output:
Class #1--Capital (resources) Class #2--Goods (commodities or use-dissipative)
Class #3--Services (action of population) Class #1 industries exist at
three levels: (1)Nature-sources of energy and raw materials. (2)Government-printing
of currency equal to gross national product (GNP), and extension (inflation)
of currency in excess of GNP. (3)Banking-loaning of money for interest,
and extension (inflation/ counterfeiting) of economic value through deposit
loan accounts. Class #2 industries exist as producers of tangible or consumer
(disopited) products. This sort of activity is usually recognized and labeled
by the public as an &quot;industry.&quot; Class #3 industries are those
which have service rather than a tangible product as their output. These
industries are called (1)households, and (2) governments. Their output
is human activity of a mechanical sort, and their basis is population.</P>

<P>AGGREGATION</P>

<P>The whole economic system can be represented by a three-industry model
if one allows the names of the outputs to be (1)capital, (2)goods, and
(3)services. The problem with this representation is that it would not</P>

<P>show the influence of, say, the textile industry on the ferrous metal
industry. This is because both the textile industry and the ferrous metal
industry would be contained within a single classification called the &quot;goods
industry&quot; and by this process of combining or aggregating these two
industries under one system block they would lose their economic individuality.</P>

<P>THE E-MODEL</P>

<P>A national economy consists of simultaneous flows of production, distribution,
consumption, and investment. If all of these elements including labor and
human functions are assigned a numerical value in like units of measure,
say, 1939 dollars, then this flow can be further represented by a current
flow in an electronic circuit, and its behavior can be predicted and manipulated
with useful precision. The three ideal passive energy components of electronics,
the capacitor, the resistor, and the inductor correspond to the three ideal
passive energy components of economics called the pure industries of capital,
goods, and services, respectively. Economic capacitance represents the
storage of capital in one form or another. Economic conductance represents
the level of conductance of materials for the production of goods. Economic
inductance represents the inertia of economic value in motion. This is
a population phenomenon known as services.</P>

<P>ECONOMIC INDUCTANCE</P>

<P>An electrical inductor (e.g., a coil of wire) has an electric current
as its primary phenomenon and a magnetic field as its secondary phenomenon
(inertia). Corresponding to this, an economic inductor has a flow of economic
value as its primary phenomenon and a population field as its secondary
phenomenon of inertia. When the flow of economic value (e.g., money) diminishes,
the human population field collapses in order to keep the economic value
(money) flowing (extreme case--war). This public inertia is a result of
consumer buying habits, expected standard of living, etc., and is generally
a phenomenon of self-preservation.</P>

<P>INDUCTIVE FACTORS TO CONSIDER</P>

<P>(1)Population (2)Magnitude of the economic activities of the government
(3)The method of financing these government activities (See Peter-Paul
Principle--inflation of the currency.)</P>

<P>TRANSLATION (A few examples will be given.) Charge--cous--dollars (1939).
Flow/Current--amperes (coulombs per second)--dollars of flow per year.
Motivating Force--volts--dollars (output) demand. Conductance--amperes
per volt--dollars of flow per year per dollar demand. Capacitance--coulombs
per volt--dollars of production inventory/ stock per dollar demand.</P>

<P>TIME FLOW RELATIONSHIPS AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE OSCILLATIONS</P>

<P>An ideal industry may be symbolized electronically in various ways.
The simplest way is to represent a demand by a voltage and a supply by
a current. When this is done, the relationship between the two becomes
what is called an admittance, which can result from three economic factors:</P>

<P>(1) hindsight flow, (2) present flow, and (3) foresight flow. Foresight
flow is the result of that property of living entities to cause energy
(food) to be stored for a period of low energy (e.g.,a winter season).
It consists of demands made upon an economic system for that period of
low energy (winter season). In a production industry it takes several forms,
one of which is known as production stock or inventory. In electronic symbology
this specific industry demand (a pure capital industry) is represented
by capacitance and the stock or resource is represented by a stored charge.
Satisfaction of an industry demand suffers a lag because of the loading
effect of inventory priorities. Present flow ideally involves no delays.
It is, so to speak, input today for output today, a &quot;hand to mouth&quot;
flow. In electronic symbology, this specific industry demand (a pure use
industry) is represented by a conduchance which is then a simple economic
valve (a dissipative element). Hindsight flow is known as habit or inertia.
In electronics this phenomenon is the characteristic of an inductor (economic
analog=a pure service industry) in which a current flow (economic analog=flow
of money) creates a magnetic field (economic analog=active human population)
which, if the current (money flow) begins to diminish, collapse (war) to
maintain the current (flow of money--energy). Other large alternatives
to war as economic inductors or economic flywheels are an open-ended social
welfare program, or an ENORMOUS (but fruitful) OPEN-ENDED SPACE PROGRAM
[WC emphasis]. The problem with stabilizing the economic system is that
there is too much demand on account of (1) too much greed and (2) too much
population. This creates excessive economic inductance which can only be
balanced with economic capacitance (true resources or value--e.g.,in goods
or services). The social welfare program is nothing more than an open-ended
credit balance system which creates a false capital industry to give nonproductive
people a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. This can be
useful, however, because the recipients become state property in return
for the &quot;gift,&quot; a standing army for the elite. For he who pays
the piper picks the tune. Those who get hooked on the economic drug, must
go to the elite for a fix. In this, the method of introducing large amounts
of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing on the future &quot;credit&quot;
of the world. This is a fourth law of motion--onset, and consists of performing
an action and leaving the system before the reflected reaction returns
to the point of action--a delayed reaction. The means of surviving the
reaction is by changing the system before the reaction can return. By this
means, politicians become popular in their own time and the public pays
for it later. In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.
The same thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond the
limit of the gross national product, an economic process called inflation.
[Note:REMEMBER THAT INFLATION IS ONLY THE ACT OF PRINTING MONEY IN EXCESS
OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT. THEY COULD BLAME IT ON THE PRICE OF WIDGETS
OR OIL ONLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNEW THE REAL CAUSE. THE REAL CAUSE AND THE
ONLY CAUSE OF INFLATION IS THE PRINTING OF MORE MONEY BEYOND THE GROSS
NATIONAL PRODUCT.] This puts a large quantity of money into the hands of
the public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a false
self-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf from the door.</P>

<P>They must eventually resort to war to balance the account, because war
ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the politicians
are the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the responsibility
and blood off the public conscience. (See section on consent factors and
social-economic structuring.)</P>

<P>If people really cared about their fellow man, they would control their
appetites (greed, procreation, etc.) so that they would not have to operate
on a credit or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfy
the bum. Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint,
there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the
system. (1)Let the populace bludgeon each other to death in war, which
will only result in a total destruction of the living earth. (2)Take control
of the world by the use of economic &quot;silent weapons&quot; in a form
of &quot;quiet warfare&quot; and reduce the economic inductance of the
world to a safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.
The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option. At this
point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about
the silent weapons is necessary. The general public refuses to improve
its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has become a herd
of proliferating barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of
the earth. They do not care enough about economic science to learn why
they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality, and their
religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders
the solution of the earthly problem unreachable by them. It is left to
those few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to
survive, to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care.
Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapons would destroy our only hope of
preserving the seed of future true humanity....</P>

<P>THE HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRY</P>

<P>The industries of finance (banking), manufacturing, and government,
real counterparts of the pure industries of capital, goods, and services,
are easily defined because they are generally logically structured. Because
of this their processes can be described mathematically and their technical
coefficients can be easily deduced. This, however, is not the case with
the service industry known as the household industry.</P>

<P>HOUSEHOLD MODELS</P>

<P>...The problem which a theoretical economist faces is that the consumer
preferences of any household is not easily predictable and the technical
coefficients of any one household extend to be a nonlinear, very complex,
and variable function of income, prices, etc.</P>

<P>Computer information derived from the use of the universal product code
in conjunction with credit-card purchase as an individual household identifier
could change this state of affairs, but the U.P.C. method is not yet available
on a national or even a significant regional scale. To compensate for this
data deficiency, an alternate indirect approach of analysis has been adopted
known as economic shock testing. This method, widely used in the aircraft
manufacturing industry, develops an aggregate statistical sort of data.
Applied to economics, this means that all of the households in one region
or in the whole nation are studied as a group or class rather than individually,
and the mass behavior rather than individual behavior is used to discover
useful estimates of the technical coefficients of the household industry
depends upon shocking the prices of a commodity and noting the changes
in the sales of all the commodities.</P>

<P>ECONOMIC SHOCK TESTING</P>

<P>In recent times, the application of Operations Research to the study
of the public economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the principles
of shock testing. In the shock testing of an aircraft airframe, the recoil
impulse of firing a gun mounted on that airframe causes shock waves in
that structure</P>

<P>which tell aviation engineers the conditions under which parts of the
airplane or the whole airplane or its wings will start to vibrate or flutter
like a guitar string, a flute reed, or a tuning fork, and disintegrate
or fall apart in flight. Economic engineers achieve the same result in
studying the behavior of the economy and the consumer public by carefully
selecting a staple commodity such as beef, coffee, gasoline, or sugar,
and then causing a sudden change or shock in its price or availability,
thus kicking every- body's budget and buying habits out of shape. They
then observe the shock waves which result by monitoring the changes in
advertising, prices, and sales of that and other commodities. The objective
of such studies is to acquire the know-how to set the public economy into
a predictable state of motion or change, even a con- trolled self-destructive
state of motion which will convince the public that certain &quot;expert&quot;
people should take control of the money system and reestablish security
(rather than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens are
rendered unable to control their financial affairs, they, of course, become
totally enslaved, a source of cheap labor. Not only the prices of commodities,
but also the availability of labor can be used as the means of shock testing.
Labor strikes deliver excellent tests shocks to an economy, especially
in the critical service areas of trucking (transportation), communication,
public utilities (energy, water, garbage collection), etc. By shock testing,
it is found that there is a direct relationship between the availability
of money flowing in an economy and the psychological outlook and response
of masses of people dependent upon that availability. For example, there
is a measurable quantitative relationship between the price of gasoline
and the probability that a person would experience a headache, feel a need
to watch a violent movie, smoke a cigarette, or go to a tavern for a mug
of beer. It is most interesting that, by observing and measuring the economic
modes by which the public tries to run from their problems and escape from
reality, and by applying the mathematical theory of Operations Re- search,
it is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combination
of created events (shocks) which will bring about a complete control and
subjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy (by
shaking the plum tree)...</P>

<P>INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC AMPLIFIERS</P>

<P>Economic amplifiers are the active components of economic engineering.
The basic characteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or economic)
is that is receives an input control signal and delivers energy from an
independent energy source to a specified output terminal in a predictable
relationship to that input control signal. The simplest form of economic
amplifier is a device called advertising. If a person is spoken to by a
T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year- old, then, due to suggestibility,
he will, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion
with the uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach into his
economic reservoir and deliver its energy to buy that product on impulse
when he passes it in the store. An economic amplifier may have several
inputs and outputs. Its response might be instantaneous or delayed. Its
circuit symbol might be a rotary switch if its options are exclusive, qualitative,
&quot;go&quot; or &quot;no go,&quot; or it might have its parametric input/output
relationships specified by a matrix with internal energy sources represented.
Whatever its form might be, its purpose is to govern the flow of energy
from a source to an output sink in direct relationship to an input control
signal. For this reason, it is called an active circuit element or component.
Economic Amplifiers fall into classes called strategies, and, in comparison
with electronic amplifiers, the specific internal functions of an economic
amplifier are called logistical instead of electrical.</P>

<P>Therefore, economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also,
in effect, are used to cause changes in the economic circuitry. In the
design of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least five
functions, which are:</P>

<P>(1) the available input signals, (2) the desired output-control objectives,
(3) the strategic objective, (4) the available economic power sources,
(5) the logistical options.</P>

<P>The process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporating
the economic amplifier into an economic system has been popularly called
GAME THEORY [WC emphasis]. The design of an economic amplifier begins with
a specification of the power level of the output, which can range from
personal to national. The second condition is accuracy of response, i.e.,
how accurately the output action is a function of the input commands. High
gain combined with strong feedback helps deliver the required precision.
Most of the error will be in the input data signal. Personal input data
tends to be specific, while national input data tends to be statistical.</P>

Minimum resistance to control Collapse of currency Destroy the faith of
the American people in each other. [WC: Ultimate objective--New World Order]</P>

<P>DIVERSION, THE PRIMARY STRATEGY</P>

<P>Experience has proven that the SIMPLEST METHOD of securing a silent
weapon and gaining control of the public is to KEEP THE PUBLIC UNDISCIPLINED
AND IGNORANT of basic systems principles on the one hand, WHILE KEEPING
THEM CONFUSED, DISORGANIZED, AND DISTRACTED with matters of no real importance
on the other hand. [WC all emphases.] This is achieved by: (1) disengaging
their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality
program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics;
and discouraging technical creativity. (2) engaging their emotions, increasing
their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities,
by: (a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional
rape) by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media--especially
the T.V. and the newspapers. (b) giving them what they desire--in excess--&quot;junk
food for thought&quot;--and depriving them of what they really need. (3)
REWRITING HISTORY and LAW and SUBJECTING THE PUBLIC TO THE DEVIANT CREATION,
thus being able to SHIFT THEIR THINKING from personal needs to highly fabricated
outside priorities. [WC all emphases.] These preclude their interest in
and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology. The
general rule is that there is profit in confusion; the more confusion,
the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and
then offer the solutions.</P>

<P>DIVERSION SUMMARY</P>

<P>Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social
issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance. Schools: Keep
the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law,
and REAL HISTORY [WC emphasis]. Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment
below sixth-grade level. Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no
time to think; back on the farm with the other animals.</P>

<P>CONSENT, THE PRIMARY VICTORY</P>

<P>A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public
by legal (but not always lawful) force. Much information is made available
to silent weapon systems programmers through the Internal Revenue Service.
(See Studies in the Structure of the American Economy for an I.R.S. source
list.) This information consists of the enforced delivery of well-organized
data contained in federal and state tax forms collected, assembled, and
submitted by slave labor provided by taxpayers and employers. Furthermore,
the number of such forms submitted to the I.R.S. is a useful indicator
of public consent, an important factor in strategic decision making. Other
data sources are given in the Short List of Inputs. Consent Coefficients--numerical
feedback indicating victory status. Psychological basis: When the government
is able to collect tax and seize private property without just compensation,
it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and is consenting
to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantified indicator
of harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despite
an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the government.</P>

<P>AMPLIFICATION ENERGY SOURCES</P>

<P>The next step in the process of designing an economic amplifier is discovering
the energy sources. The energy sources which support any primitive economic
system are, of course, a supply of raw materials, and the consent of the
people to labor and consequently assume a certain rank, position, level,
or class in the social structure; i.e., to provide labor at various levels
in the pecking order. Each class, in guaranteeing its own level of income,
controls the class immediately below it, hence preserves the class structure.
This provides stability and security, but also government from the top.
As time goes on and communication and education improve, the lower-class
elements of the social labor structure become knowledgeable and envious
of the good things that the upper-class members have. They also begin to
attain a knowledge of energy systems and the ability to enforce their rise
through the class structure. This threatens the sovereignty of the elite.
If this rise of the lower classes can be postponed long enough, the elite
can achieve energy dominance, and LABOR BY CONSENT NO LONGER WILL HOLD
A POSITION [WC emphasis] of an essential economic energy source. Until
such energy dominance is absolutely established, the consent of people
to labor and let others handle their affairs must be taken into consideration,
since failure to do so could cause the people to interfere in the final
transfer of energy sources to the control of the elite. It is essential
to recognize that at this time, public consent is still an essential key
to the release of energy in the process of economic amplification. Therefore,
consent as an energy release mechanism will now be considered.</P>

<P>LOGISTICS</P>

<P>The successful application of a strategy requires a careful study of
inputs, outputs, the strategy connecting the input and the outputs, and
the available energy sources to fuel the strategy. This study is called
logistics. A logistical problem is studied at the elementary level first,
and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of elementary
factors. This means that a given system is analyzed, i.e., broken down
into its subsystems, and these in turn are analyzed, until, by this process,
one arrives at the logistical &quot;atom,&quot; THE INDIVIDUAL [WC emphasis].
This is where the process of SYNTHESIS [WC emphasis] properly begins, and
at the time of the birth of the individual.</P>

<P>THE ARTIFICIAL WOMB</P>

<P>From the time a person leaves its mother's womb, its every effort is
directed toward building, maintaining, and withdrawing into artificial
wombs, various sorts of substitute protective devices or shells. The objective
of these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environment for both stable
and unstable activity; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary processes
of growth and maturity--i.e., survival; to provide security for freedom
and to provide defensive protection for offensive activity. This is equally
true of both the general public and the elite. However, there is a definite
difference in the way each of these classes go about the solution of problems.</P>

<P>THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF A NATION-- DEPENDENCY</P>

<P>The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create a
political structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate their
own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a human
god to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the head, kiss their
bruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tuck
them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright [sic]
when they wake up in the morning.</P>

<P>The public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meets
incredibility with incredibility by promising the world and delivering
nothing.</P>

<P>So who is the bigger liar? the public? or the &quot;godfather&quot;?
This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expediency.
It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon, useful against
disgusting public.</P>

<P>ACTION/OFFENSE</P>

<P>Most people want to be able to subdue and/or kill other human beings
which disturb their daily lives, but they do not want to have to cope with
the moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part might
raise. Therefore, they assign the dirty work to others (including their
own children) so as to keep the blood off their own hands. They rave about
the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger
from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight. But
even more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional association
of hit men collectively called politicians, and then complain about corruption
in the government.</P>

<P>RESPONSIBILITY</P>

<P>Again, most people want to be free to do things (to explore, etc.) but
they are afraid to fail. The fear of failure is manifested in irresponsibility,
and especially in delegating those personal responsibilities to others
where success is uncertain or carries possible or created liabilities (law)
which the person is not prepared to accept. They want authority (root word--&quot;author&quot;),
but they will not accept responsibility or liability. So they hire politicians
to face reality for them.</P>

<P>SUMMARY</P>

<P>The people hire the politicians so that the people can: (1) obtain security
without managing it. (2) obtain action without thinking about it. (3) inflict
theft, injury, and death upon others without having to con- template either
life or death. (4) avoid responsibility for their own intentions. (5) obtain
the benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in the
discipline of facing or learning either of these things.</P>

<P>They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine
to: (1) provide for the survival of the NATION/WOMB (2) prevent encroachment
of anything upon the NATION/WOMB (3) destroy the enemy who threatens the
NATION/WOMB (4) destroy those citizens of their own country who do not
conform for the sake of stability of the NATION/WOMB Politicians hold many
quasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the
attorneys and the C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed),
and the judges who shout the orders and run the</P>

<P>closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals
are industrialists. The &quot;presidential&quot; level of commander-in-chief
is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have
created this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but
they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite. Thus, a nation becomes
divided into two very distinct parts, a DOCILE SUB-NATION [great silent
majority] and a POLITICAL SUB-NATION. The political sub-nation remains
attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance
until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent.</P>

<P>SYSTEM ANALYSIS</P>

<P>In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war,
the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical
values to each element of the war structure--personnel and material alike.
This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsystems
of such a structure.</P>

<P>THE DRAFT (As military service)</P>

<P>Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more
effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft.
a primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by
intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction
that the government is omnipotent. [WC Note: The truth is just the opposite,
as government exists only with the consent of the people.] He is soon taught
that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus,
a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life
can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of
his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction
is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill. EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS
THE PROCESS BY WHICH A YOUNG MAN'S PARENTS, WHO PURPORTEDLY LOVE HIM, CAN
BE INDUCED TO SEND HIM OFF TO WAR TO HIS DEATH [WC emphasis]. Although
the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full
detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve
to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in
a computer analysis of social and war systems. We begin with a tentative
definition of the draft. THE DRAFT (selective service, etc.) is an institution
of COMPULSORY collective SACRIFICE and SLAVERY, devised by the middle-aged
and the elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public
dirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders,
thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational
Stabilizer). It is marketed and sold to the public under the label of &quot;patriotic=national&quot;
service. Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that
definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human
Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory.
The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values,
a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service
job demand, etc. Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentatively
evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists.
Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of
social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother's instruction
to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands
upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing
his resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for a
banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.</P>

<P>Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime
espionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical
models (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least to
predetermine these events with maximum certainty. That does not exist by
natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings
are machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is little
real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.
These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table
of Human Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in true
measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presently
inflated beyond the production of national goods and services so as to
give the economy a false kinetic energy (&quot;paper&quot; inductance).
The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount with
a gram of silver today as could be bought in 1920. Human value measured
in silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology.</P>

<P>ENFORCEMENT</P>

<P>FACTOR I As in every social system approach, stability is achieved only
by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction pat-
terns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous. As in other
human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive)
is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action
and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.
To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family
unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control.</P>

<P>FACTOR II--FATHER The man of the household must be housebroken to ensure
that junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes.
The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be
is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that
he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life
will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to
see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorable
behavior. By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a
backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the
censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment
he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war
or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose
not withstanding.</P>

<P>FACTOR III--MOTHER The female element of human society is ruled by emotion
first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination
always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the
child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby
is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source
of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition
to &quot;reality&quot; when it comes, or sooner. As the transition becomes
more difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated,
and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers
must become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment
of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation
of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory).
CAUTION: A woman's impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman's
power must never be</P>

<P>FACTOR IV--JUNIOR The emotional pressure for self-preservation during
time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have
an option to avoid the battlefield--if junior can be persuaded to go--is
all of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Their
quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: &quot;No sacrifice, no friends;
no glory, no girlfriends.&quot;</P>

<P>FACTOR V--SISTER And what about junior's sister? She is given all the
good things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from her
future husband regardless of the price.</P>

<P>FACTOR VI--CATTLE Those who will not use their brains are no better
off than those who have no brains, and so this mindless school of jelly-fish,
father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers
of the same.</P>

<P>WC/Author's Note: So now you know. This chapter could only come in the
beginning. Your preconceived ideas had to be shattered in order for you
to understand the rest of this book. In this chapter you can see every
step that the elite have taken in their war to control this once great
nation. You can see the steps that will be taken in the future. You can
no longer pretend innocence. Your denial of the conspiracy will fall on
deaf ears. This book is part of the education that will give Americans
the weapons needed in the coming months and years of hardship as the New
World Order struggles to be born.</P>

<P>Many will argue that &quot;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars&quot; is only
a bogus conglomeration of words for which the writer has never taken credit
or responsibility. Those who do so ignore the self-evident truths contained
within the document. They ignore these truths because they are an indictment
of their own ignorance, which they cannot face.</P>

<P>The document, first found in 1969, correctly outlines events which subse-
quently came to pass. It cannot be ignored or dismissed. The document is
genuine. Its truths cannot be negated or shrugged away. The message is
this: You must accept that you have been cattle and the ultimate consequence
of being cattle--which is slavery--or you must prepare to fight, and if
necessary die to preserve your God-given right to Freedom.</P>

<P>That last sentence is the real reason why people choose to ignore &quot;Silent
Weapons for Quiet Wars.&quot; People are not ready to admit that they have
been cattle. They are not prepared to fight, and if necessary to die, for
Freedom. It is an indictment of the citizens of the United States of America.
And that is the total confirmation of the truth of the information contained
in &quot;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.&quot;</P>

<P>The Anomalous Events of STS-48 by Vince Johnson </P>

<P>The anomalous events during the shuttle Discovery mission STS-48 (launched
September 12, 1991) were originally revealed by space enthusiasts who had
set their VCRs to record NASA Select TV, which at the time was downlinked
live from each shuttle mission and distributed on cable and satellite TV.
To record as much as possible, VCRs were set to record at slow speed (six
hour recordings) which resulted in less than optimal recordings. When the
recordings were reviewed, anomalous objects were seen at several points
in the mission. Although the existence of these recordings have been known
to MUFON and FUFOR since the fall of 1991, surprisingly, they were not
made public until Don Ecker appeared on &quot;HardCopy,&quot; and later,
&quot;Larry King Live&quot; with a poor copy of what has been termed Event
2 in June of this year. After personally reviewing the video of Events
1,2,3,4 and 6, some of which were obtained from the official NASA video
archive, I can only surmise that the events are indeed anomalous and unexplained.
The official NASA explanation of ice and debris seems unlikely due to the
different directions and speeds the objects appear to be traveling. The
following is a chronology of the anomalous events of STS-48: EVENT 1 (9-13-91
/ between 03:49 - 04:10 GMT) The camera shows a beautiful view from the
forward cabin looking back through the cargo bay at the tail section with
the Earth filling the top of the screen. One-by-one, a series of five lights
travel radially from behind the tail section, comprising an arc. Then an
extremely bright blinking light appears, traveling up from behind the left
engine. This bright light occupies the focus of the arc composed of the
five smaller lights. Then the camera inexplicably pans down into the cargo
bay, focusing on a piece of equipment there. After a minute, the ground
controller requests that she be given control of the camera. After a short
pause, the astronaut complies. The camera then pans back up into the tail
area. The lights that were there just moments before are now gone. EVENT
2 (9-15-91 / between 20:30 - 20:45 GMT) This scene shows the nightside
Earth filling most of the frame with the horizon extending from the upper
left of screen to the lower right. Black space is seen above the horizon
at the screen's upper right. Clouds, bright city lights on the surface,
and an intense lightning storm can be seen. The atmosphere is slightly
luminescent at the limb and is clearly discernible. Against this background,
several lighted objects can be seen traveling slowly, apparently above
the atmosphere. One of the larger objects (2A -see Event2a.GIF) appears
and slowly moves across the sky below. Another large object (2F) appears
near the center of the screen, either traveling up through the atmosphere
from below, or through it at the limb and traveling towards the shuttle.
This object travels slowly, parallel to the horizon, from lower right to
upper left. Suddenly, a bright flash of light fills the screen. As the
flash diminishes, two odd streaks of light emanate from the left. The object
traveling parallel to the horizon executes an acute (less than 90 degree)
turn and shoots off into space, dimming as it recedes. The upper of the
two streaks would have intercepted the object traveling along the horizon
if it had stayed on its course without making its sudden turn. The bottom
streak shoots off towards the right of the screen. Throughout Event 2,
other lighted objects move across the field of view at varying speeds and
headings. Note: The official NASA explanation for this event is that ice
crystals are being propelled by a shuttle attitude thruster being fired.
The fact that the Earth does not appear to shift in the frame indicates
that the shuttle's attitude is not changed and therefore, no thruster is
being fired during this event. EVENT 3 (9-16-91 / 08:40 -09:10 GMT) This
scene shows the sunlit Earth filling the screen. Other than cloud formations,
no surface details are discernible. This clip can only be described as
chaotic. There are dozens of objects streaking in every direction. Although
sizes and distances cannot be calculated from the video alone, many of
these objects appear to be descending into, and flying through the atmosphere.
There is a similar streak as in Event 2 that intercepts one of the objects.
After about 30- 45 seconds of this, a larger elliptical white object appears
in the extreme upper left corner of the frame. This object is visible for
only 5-6 frames before another camera is switched on showing the side of
the shuttle with empty black space in the background. Note: Again, there
is no apparent change in the shuttle's orientation during this event, indicating
that no thruster is being fired. Chronologically, Event 3 occurs after
Event 4. The numbering system developed before all video was available
to researchers. EVENT 4 (9-15-91 / between 19:00 - 19:10 GMT) While few
details of the objects were apparent to me, researcher Vince DiPietro reports
that a large bell-shaped object appears, and that other objects move from
the bottom to the top of the screen. His analysis allegedly reveals that
several of these objects have an oblong shape, with sections of the objects
appearing to rotate at high speed. EVENT 5 (Video, date and time unavailable)
According to Vince DiPietro, a large &quot;tubular shaped&quot; object
moves from right to left. Also, DiPietro reports that a pulsating light
is seen at the top of the screen Note: HUFON Report has not seen video
of Event 5. According to our source, Ron Madeley, this event has been expunged
from the official NASA STS-48 video archive, leaving a 14 minute gap in
the video's time code. If this is true, it would be irrefutable evidence
of a NASA cover-up. EVENT 6 (Date and time unavailable) The sunlit Earth
fills the screen, with no surface details (other than clouds) discernible.
A bright object enters the frame at left center and zips across the screen
at high speed. When played in normal mode, the object seems to be a white
light traveling in a smooth trajectory. When advanced frame-by-frame, the
object changes color from red to green to white. Instead of a smooth trajectory,
the object can be seen to travel in short, discrete steps, with the aforementioned
color changes cycling during each step. The object seems to disappear while
actually moving between each step. As a lifelong supporter of our space
exploration efforts I have observed many hours of NASA footage. Never have
I seen events such as those recorded by STS-48. Lighted objects could most
certainly be debris or ice crystals illuminated by the sun, however, I
can conceive of no possible scenario that could explain the objects that
are travelling in opposite directions. Presumably, thruster plumes should
propel debris in one direction only. Another potential explanation would
be meteor storms or space debris from previous launches. But again, these
explanations cannot account for the observed trajectories . According to
our source, NASA no longer distributes a live downlink from shuttle missions,
instead using a delay similar to that used by talk radio stations to censor
offensive remarks. Sanitizing video downlink from shuttle missions, and
deleting sections of the official archives is not in the interest of the
taxpayers who fund NASA. The need for further official scientific inquiry
is obvious. In the meantime, the anomalous events recorded by Discovery
astronauts during STS-48 can only be classified as UFOs, in the strict
sense of the term. Note: Vince DiPietro's report to FUFOR (the Fund For
UFO Research) provided the descriptions of events for which video was unavailable
to HUFON Report. Interestingly, DiPietro, a NASA employee at the Goddard
Space Flight Center now publicly endorses the &quot;ice crystal&quot; explanation.</P>
