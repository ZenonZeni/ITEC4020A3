<td rowspan=2><b>As a direct result of experience gained since 1992</b>,
preparing bids for NFFO 3 and 4, the company is now in an excellent position
to promote economically advantageous wind energy solutions for <b>businesses</b>
and private individuals. 
<p>The company has negotiated with the Regional Electric Company (REC)
to obtain import/export metering for grid connected projects ranging from
5 kilowatts to 15 megawatts. Indeed, we are confident that for customers
with an annual electricity bill in excess of £10,000, we can create a project
that will yield a POSITIVE cash flow relative to the current electricity
bill. This is partly due to the REC’s ability to pay it’s traditional customers
for exported wind energy. The tarrifs for these payments will vary, but
in general, the highest prices paid are during the winter months, when
wind energy is abundant.</p>

<p>There is a near continuous spectrum of wind turbines rated between <b>10
WATTS </b>and <b>1.5 MEGAWATTS</b> at any voltages (AC or DC). The company
is familiar with all the manufacturers of wind turbines and related equipment
( European and World wide ) and is therefore well placed to select and
match the correct equipment according to the customer’s need. The company
is not affiliated or connected to any one manufacturer.</p>
