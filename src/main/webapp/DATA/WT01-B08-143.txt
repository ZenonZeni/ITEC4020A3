<A NAME="veggie"></A><H2>Veg food</A> hits a grand slam</H2>
<B>
<P>Whitney Farms <A HREF="veggie.htm">Vegetable Food</A> is the best team player in the organic vegetable garden.</P><P>This fertilizer, known to its fans as Veg, shares many traits with those baseball heroes who get the job done without calling attention to themselves.</P>
<P>Like Cal Ripken, Veg is well-rounded and always there when needed. Veg has blood meal to promote green growth in the cool days of spring, and dried poultry waste to sustain plants throughout the season. Bone meal and sunflower hull ash round out Veg with phosphorus and potash so plants produce strong roots and abundant fruit.</P>
<P>Unlike its tired competitors, the chemical fertilizers, Veg will never have a rain delay because its ingredients will not wash away under heavy rains or irrigation.</P>
<P>Veg, with its kelp meal, will also help plants take any curve that nature can throw at it. The potash and micronutrients in kelp meal help plants resist pests and diseases and enhance their overall vigor and hardiness.</P>
<P>Veg is also a great motivator of its teammates. Its organic matter stimulates soil organisms, like earthworms, which greatly contribute to a garden's fertility and productivity.</P>
<P>Other players may boast bigger numbers, but Veg gives all its has and will never burn out, wash out or fade in the stretch.</P>
<P>Those gardeners who have Veg on their team wouldn't trade it for all those over-promised hotshots in the league.</P>

<H3>Raised Beds in the Vegetable Garden</H3>
<IMG SRC="BEDVEG.gif" ALIGN="right"><P>In 19th century Paris, growing vegetables reached a zenith unparalleled even to this day.  Small market gardens using intensive methods supplied the city with an incomparable variety of fresh produce throughout the year.  The famed English gardener, William Robinson remarked in his book, Parks and Gardens of Paris that, "The culture of salads for the Paris market is not merely good it is perfection." Using techniques dating back to the 1600s it was not unheard of for these gardens to produce asparagus in December; radishes, lettuces, and mushrooms in January; cauliflower in March; strawberries in early April; peas in May; and melons in June. Similar methods were employed for centuries by the gardeners and farmers of China.</P>
<P>Unlike the use of row planting in "modern" vegetable gardens, which wastes an incredible amount of space, the gardeners of 19th century Paris maximized the production of their market gardens by using their limited space as efficiently as possible.  <B>A hallmark of these methods was the use of intensively planted, heavily amended raised beds.</B></P>
<IMG SRC="RAISED.gif" ALIGN="left"><P>Somewhat forgotten with the advent of the "Green Revolution," raised beds found their way into American gardens through the work of Allan Chadwick at the Garden Project at the University of California at Santa Cruz.  On a steep hillside above what was then the main entrance to the campus, Chadwick carved a veritable Eden out of heavy clay soils covered with native shrubs and poison oak. In early 1967 when he began his work at the Garden Project the soil was as hard as rock and no one could imagine the transformation it would undergo.  Using techniques Chadwick described as "The Bio-dynamic French Intensive Method", techniques adapted from the French market gardeners of a century earlier, he and a core group of students began a remarkable process. Today, a visit to the Garden Project reveals amazingly productive soils that are easily worked with a garden fork.  Every year, the garden produces an unbelievable abundance of vegetable crops and cut flowers.</P>
<P>Like the market gardens of 19th century Paris, the key to the productivity of the Garden Project in Santa Cruz is the use of intensively planted raised beds.  For many gardeners the mere mention of raised beds implies a massive construction project and a small fortune in wood, which steers many away from raised-bed gardening.  In reality, that image could not be further from the truth.  The French Intensive method does not require a vast investment in timber; the soil is raised simply through cultivation and the introduction of air into the soil.  The French Intensive method only requires the gardener to shift from planting in rows (moved about from season to season) to planting in permanent beds.  The beds become the focus of all soil-building efforts.  In turn, the paths are made permanent and all the traffic in the garden is restricted to those paths.  This allows the soil in the beds to undergo a remarkable transformation.</P>
<A NAME="raise"></A><H3>Raise Your Beds</H3>
<P>Raised beds provide the gardener with a number of important benefits.  By employing a method of deep cultivation, they mimic nature¹s own soil dynamics of aeration and drainage.  Raised beds drain readily, allowing earlier planting in the spring.  At the same time they warm up faster, which encourages faster rooting and earlier growth and leads to earlier harvests.  The soil is kept loose and well-aerated in raised beds so that the plants are able to establish more vigorous root systems and take advantage of a larger portion of the nutrients in the soil.  Because the beds are never walked on, there is minimal compaction of the soil in the growing area, which results in better retention of soil structure.
Studies show that the yield, when using this method, is four times the yield of traditional row planting because of the more efficient use of space in the garden.  In his book, The Self Sufficient Gardener, John Seymour wrote of his own skepticism about the vast difference between the two methods: "I had read these figures but did not fully believe them.  I went to California to see for myself...Seeing is believing and in this case I am completely convinced of the superiority of this method."</P>
<P>Constructing raised beds is relatively simple. Traditionally they are constructed using a technique called <A HREF="DOUBLE.gif">"double digging."(see diagram)</A>  To begin, lay out a bed four to five feet wide‹a good rule of thumb is to make the bed twice as wide as you can reach.  The bed can be made as long as needed or as space allows.  One important consideration when deciding on the length of the bed, however, is the time it will take you to walk around it; once established you should never walk on it.  A convenient length for most people is 20 to 25 feet.  Raised beds are often oriented to the south so that the plants in the bed get an even exposure to light as the sun moves from east to west. You can lay your beds out side by side with paths in between.  Be sure your paths are wide enough to allow you to move comfortably around the beds.</P>
<P>After marking out the area, lay a covering of manure or compost on top of the bed.  (For vegetable gardens you could use <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Whitney Farms Barnyard Manure</A>.  If establishing beds for perennials or other plants, use our Uncle Malcolm's Planting Mix.)  If needed you can also add lime or other fertilizers like <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Whitney Farms Vegetable Food</A> to the bed at this time.  To begin digging, simply dig a trench to a spade's depth and width.  Set the soil from the trench aside in a wheelbarrow.  Dig your spade or fork into the bottom of the trench and loosen the soil as deeply as you can; leave the large clods in the bottom of the trench to promote drainage.  Some gardeners add more compost to the trench at this time to aid in loosening the deeper layers of soil.</P>
<P>Working backwards down the length of the bed, dig out a second trench next to the first one and "slide" the soil and manure into the first trench.  Do not invert the soil layers if possible‹keep the topsoil on the surface and the subsoil below it.  Work the bottom of the second trench as you did the first.  From here move the third spade's width of soil into the second trench.  Continue in this fashion until you reach the end of the bed.  After loosening the soil in the bottom of the last trench fill it with the soil from the first trench.  Looking down the length of your newly tilled bed, you will see that the soil has formed a rough mound.  In fact, you may be surprised to find the soil much more raised than you imagined possible.</P>
<P>To complete the process, use a digging fork to work the surface of the new bed, breaking up clods as you go.  Use the fork in a lifting motion to bring clods to the surface‹like sifting flour.  A gentle side-to-side motion with the fork breaks the clods up into a finer texture. Don¹t pound down onto the bed to break up the clods of soil, that only serves to compact the soil again.  Rake any soil that falls onto the paths back up into the bed.</P>
<H3>These Paths Are Made For Walking</H3>
<P>From this point onward, NEVER WALK ON THE BED nor let anyone else walk on it.  Always tend and work the bed from the paths.  The only time you should walk on the bed again is if you are deep digging for another season.</P>
<P>It is not necessary to double dig to form raised beds.  You can also rototill the beds, leaving the paths untouched and raking any excess soil back up into the bed.  Top-dress the bed with manure or compost as you would for double digging.  Typically, however, tilling does not result in as loose or deeply prepared a bed as does hand digging and can leave a layer of compacted soil at the lower limits of the tiller depth.  Rototilling can also lead to a pulverized soil texture if overdone.  This in turn can lead to problems with drainage and aeration.</P>
<P>Depending on the quality of your soil, one initial digging is often all that is required.  To maintain the beds, simply dress them annually with compost, fertilizer, and lime as needed, and till them with your digging fork.  Gardeners with heavy clay soils may need to double dig the beds for a couple of years to ensure that their improvements are permanent.</P>
<H3>Planting Raised Beds</H3>
<P>Perhaps the single biggest advantage of raised beds is the dense planting pattern they allow as compared to row plantings.  Don't plant in traditional rows; instead work in a triangular pattern with your crops spaced in "clumps."  The objective is to space the plants so that the leaves just touch when they are mature.  The overall effect is to create diagonal rows of closely spaced plants that waste no soil in the bed.  Because the soil is so deeply prepared and traffic is limited to the paths, plants grown using raised beds typically develop much more vigorous root systems, which allows for denser planting.</P>
<P>There are several other benefits that result from using a dense planting pattern.  Because the leaves of the plants just touch when mature, they create a micro-climate within the bed.  Weeds are suppressed by the shading of the crop plants, and because the soil is so loose, any that grow in the bed are easily removed.  You will also find that the garden will use less water than a traditional "row garden" because of the shading of the soil surface.</P>
<P>When seeding raised beds:  Sow them heavily and thin the seedlings after germination to allow for the mature plants to just touch as outlined above.  Direct sowing plants like carrots or radishes in a raised bed will result in significantly higher yields in a very small area as compared to sowing seeds in rows.</P>
<H3>Unlimited Applications</H3>
<P>Raised beds are easily adapted for use throughout the garden.  The same methods can be extended to preparing areas for planting annual flowers, bulbs, perennials, roses, and other shrubs.  Even trees can be planted using this technique.  In all cases your garden and the plants growing in it will benefit from the richly prepared soil.  The time and energy required to transform your garden will be paid back immeasurably by the increased yields and the ease of maintaining raised beds.</P>
