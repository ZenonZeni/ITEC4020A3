White Pages Service offered/Aldea communications <p>

I'm writing for more information about the enclosed posting, which raised
all sort of privacy-related issues that I plan to discuss in class (which
is why I've copied my "Taming the Electronic Frontier" class on this
reply). <p>

Who is Aldea Communications? How will this information be used? The fact
that your announcement left these questions vague is a red flag, with
sinister connotations that you might wish to immediately correct. Unless,
of course, these connotations are correct. <p>

Are you the good guys, out to do the internet a favor by helping other good
guys stay in touch? Your name could easily be interpreted to mean a market
research firm out to line your pockets by building a database of good guys
for the bad guys to send junk mail to. <p>

Which are you? How will this information be used? <p>

Brad The Bewildered <p>

&gt;
&gt;Folks,
&gt;
&gt;I always think twice about sending thing to the Internauts
&gt;list but white pages is such a critical need, I thought you
&gt;would forgive me this exception.

&gt;Subject: NetPages .. Feel Free to Forward as Appropriate
&gt;
&gt;Aldea Communications wants to help people find each other on the Internet,
&gt;so the concept of NetPages(tm) was developed.  NetPages is an Internet
&gt;email address directory based on the "phone book" concept with white and
&gt;yellow pages.  It will be published twice a year, with the first edition
&gt;coming out in March, 1994.  The first edition will be distributed in
&gt;hard-copy at UNIFORUM and electronically for downloading on the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;You may make a white pages listing free of charge.  All information is
&gt;optional.  Your listing will be sent to you prior to the compilation of the
&gt;directory for verification.  Yellow pages listings are available in the
&gt;NetPages for those of you with more information to deliver.  Contact us for
&gt;pricing.
&gt;
&gt;If you have any questions or comments, write to netpages@aldea.com or call
&gt;1-800-TO ALDEA  (619-943-0101).  All listees will be notified of the
&gt;electronic Internet "pickup" spot in March.
&gt;
&gt;**********************************************************
&gt;To add your name to the directory simply return this completed template to
&gt;netpages@aldea.com.  We need your entry by February 21 to meet the printing
