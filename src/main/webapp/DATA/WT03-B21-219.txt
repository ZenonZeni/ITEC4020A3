		<A NAME= "Note1"></A><P><B>1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B><BR>
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in Canada which, in the Company's case, conform in all material respects with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, except as disclosed in note 16.
<P>The significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its incorporated and unincorporated
joint ventures are summarized as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>(a) Basis of consolidation</B><BR>
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Investments in incorporated and unincorporated joint ventures are accounted for by the proportionate
consolidation method as substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through joint
ventures. 

<P><B>(b) Translation of foreign currencies</B><BR>
The accounts of the Canadian operations and operations in foreign countries have been translated into
United States dollars using the temporal method because the Company considers the U.S. dollar to be
the principal currency of its operations. Under this method, monetary assets and liabilities have been
translated at the end of year exchange rates. Non-monetary assets, which primarily comprise
inventories and mining property, plant and equipment, have been translated using historic rates of
exchange. Revenues and expenses have been translated at the average rates of exchange during the
years, except for depletion and depreciation, which have been translated at the same rates as the related
assets.
<P>Foreign exchange gains and losses on current monetary assets and liabilities are included in the
determination of earnings. Gains and losses related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over
the remaining term of the debt.

<P><B>(c) Inventories</B><BR>
Gold and silver bullion inventories are stated at market. Doré, work-in-process and ore stockpiles are
stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Materials and supplies inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or replacement value.

<P><B>(d) Mining property, plant and equipment</B><BR>
Mining property, plant and equipment is shown at cost including costs associated with acquisition and
further development of mining properties. Depletable assets are amortized over the life of the mine on
a unit-of-production basis. The estimated mine lives range from 6 to 20 years with the average being
17 years. Depreciable assets are also amortized over the life of the mine on a unit-of-production basis
except where the useful life of a depreciable asset is less than the life of the mine, in which case
depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis.

<P><B>(e) Exploration and business development</B><BR>
Exploration expenditures, excluding property acquisition costs, are charged to earnings as incurred. 
When it has been established that a mining property has development potential, further exploration
costs incurred prior to the start of mining operations, are recorded as deferred development costs and
amortized as development costs in accordance with the policies described above.

<P><B>(f) Reclamation costs</B><BR>
Expenditures relating to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against
earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefit. 
These ongoing programs are designed to minimize the environmental impact of the Company's mining
operations and should significantly reduce future removal and site restoration costs that 
may otherwise be incurred upon cessation of mining activities. Estimated future reclamation costs,
including site restoration, where reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the
estimated life of the mine.

<P><B>(g) Income and mining taxes</B><BR>
Deferred income and mining taxes are provided as a result of timing differences that arise in the
recognition of revenue and expenses in different years for accounting than for income and mining tax
reporting purposes. Taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings of non-Canadian operations
based upon the level of expected remittance of these earnings.

<P><B>(h) Financing costs</B><BR>
Debt issue costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt. Financing costs, including
interest and debt issue costs, are capitalized when they arise from indebtedness incurred to finance
development activities on properties that are not in full production and are amortized to earnings when
mining operations commence. 
 
<P><B>(i) Commitments to deliver gold and silver</B><BR>
Commitments to deliver gold and silver arise from gold and silver loans, fixed forward sales, spot
deferred sales and option contracts.
<P>Contracted prices on forward sales, spot deferred sales and options related to future production are
recognized in revenue as the related gold and silver is delivered.
<P>Gold and silver loans which hedge the Company's share of revenues from future production are
marked to the spot price at the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses are deferred and are
reflected in earnings when the hedged production is delivered.

<P><B>(j) Cash and cash equivalents</B><BR> 
Cash and cash equivalents include those short-term money market instruments which, on acquisition,
generally have a term to maturity of three months or less.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME= "Note2"></A><P><B>2. Accounts Receivable</B><BR>
As a result of inflows of overburden material and caving of fault material in 1992, the Company has
recorded $4,966,000 as insurance claims receivable (December 31, 1994 - $4,920,000), representing
its share of costs incurred as a result of the incidents, excluding any business interruption costs, and net
of an interim payment of $1,238,000 received in 1993. The Company has filed insurance claims,
which include business interruption costs. As described in Note 15 (c), this claim has been settled.

<LI>Under a credit agreement dated March 9, 1990, the Company owes a balance of 2,088,300
  (1994 - 3,480,500) ounces of silver. This loan is repayable in three equal semi-annual installments
  from February 28, 1996 to February 28, 1997. Interest is at a rate of 2.5%. 
  The Company has pledged its residual interest in the La Coipa mine as collateral for this loan. The
  balance of silver to be delivered has been hedged by acquiring silver purchase contracts on the
  installment dates of the repayments totalling 2,088,300 silver ounces with an average purchase
  price of $6.58 (1994 - $6.37).
  
 <P><LI>The New Britannia project financing is repayable in twelve equal quarterly installments
  commencing no later than September 30, 1996. The loan is convertible into different types of
  advances with interest determined based on the type of advance selected. Interest was charged at the
  London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") which varied between 6.4% and 6.8% per annum in
  1995. The loan is denominated in United States dollars and was fully utilized at December 31,
  1995. The loan is secured by the assets of the joint venture and a first charge on the ownership
  interests of the joint venture participants in the New Britannia mine. The Company has guaranteed

  completion test period, the loan will be classified into recourse and non-recourse portions based on
  forecasted mine cash flows.

  equal to the one year Greek State bond rate.

  <P><LI>The balance of the La Coipa project financing is repayable on June 30, 1996. Interest is at  a
  rate of 1 1/8% per annum over LIBOR. The loan is secured by the assets of the joint                                         venture and a first charge on the ownership interests of the joint venture participants in the                                         La Coipa mine.

These loans are denominated in U.S. dollars and interest is charged at rates which vary   between 8.2% and 9.6%. These loans mature prior to June 30, 1996, however, it is the intention of the joint venture partners to renew these loans at each maturity.
  
 <P><LI>The Novo Astro BNDES loans were repaid in monthly installments ending on October,                 1995. Interest was charged at varying rates in 1995. The loan was secured by a charge on  the
  mining rights, machinery and equipment at the Novo Astro mine, and certain other                                                guarantees.

<P>At December 31, 1995, the Company has open purchase contracts for 2.96 million ounces of silver at an average price of $5.93 per ounce (December 31, 1994  10 million ounces at $5.93 per ounce) 
2 million of which is to offset silver forwards and calls sold and puts purchased by the operator of the La Coipa mine. As at December 31, 1995 the Companys share of total silver forwards sold and in the money calls sold and puts purchased at the La Coipa mine was 2.4 million ounces at a weighted average price of $5.33 per ounce of silver (December 31, 1994  6,625,000 ounces at $5.07 per ounce). At December 31, 1995, as a result of these transactions, the Company has realized and unrealized losses amounting to $0.31 per ounce (December 31, 1994  $0.23 per ounce realized revenue), which will be charged to income when the balance of the 10 million ounces is delivered by La Coipa.

<P>In addition to the above hedging, the Company has sold 1 million ounces of puts with a strike price of $5.00 expiring in 1996.<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Kassandra Litigation</B><BR>							
	A claim was filed against the Company on November 15, 1995, and subsequently amended, relating to the Companys interest in the Kassandra mining assets in Greece. The plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duties and misuse of confidential information and seek, among other things: 	
	(i) a declaration that the Company holds the Kassandra orebodies in trust for the plaintiffs; or \
	(ii) acknowledgement that the Company holds a 12% carried interest in Kassandra in trust for the plaintiffs and a further 12% right to purchase in Kassandra; and (iii) damages in the amount of $500 million (Cdn.); and punitive damages in the amount of $1 million (Cdn.).

	<P>The Company is in the process of filing its statement of defence and while the outcome is not presently determinable, the Company firmly believes that the claims made by the plaintiffs are unfounded. The Company will aggressively defend this matter.

	A Complaint Seeking Damages and Demand for Jury Trial with Injunctive Relief Sought was filed in the United States District Court against the Company on October 19, 1995 relating to their mining interests in Kamchatka, Russia. The plaintiffs allege that the Company breached the terms of a confidentiality agreement and claim, among other things: (i) judgment against the Company for breach of contract; (ii) a mandatory injunction to cease and desist from using the plaintiffs information and to stop all exploration, negotiation or purchasing of mining rights in Kamchatka; and (iii) the deposit in court of all sums collected by the Company as a result of mining and exploration of the subject sites.

	<P>The Company has filed an Answer, Affirmative Defences and Counterclaim on February 2, 1996 and while the outcome is not presently determinable, the Company firmly believes the claims made by the plaintiffs are unfounded. The Company will aggressively defend this matter.

<P><LI><B>Kassandra Mines Commitments</B><BR>
	Pursuant to the acquisition of the Kassandra Mine assets, signed on December 21, 1995, the Company is obligated to fulfil the following; <I>Purchase Price Mortgage:</I> To provide the vendor with a mortgage of approximately $36.0 million as security for unpaid purchase price amounts plus interest. The payment terms of the acquisition require 5 equal installments, on December 21 of each year, for approximately $5.5 million, plus applicable interest; <I>Gold Plant Guarantee:</I> The Company is obligated to construct a gold plant within two years from receiving all applicable licences, which may be extended by a further eight months under certain circumstances. The Company has provided a letter of guarantee of approximately $11.0 million against this commitment; <I>Employment Guarantee:</I> The Company is obligated to maintain 550 employees and a further 50 employees once the gold plant is completed, for a minimum period of three years. The Greek government is obligated to provide an allowance of 50% of the cost to employ 50 of these employees for a six month period and an additional 50 employees for a three year period. Additionally, employment must be offered by the contractor to 150 former employees of Kassandra for a period of 18 months, during the construction of the gold plant.

<P><LI><B>Kasperske Hory Commitment</B><BR> 
	Pursuant to an agreement dated August 8, 1994, as amended, the Company is obligated to issue to each of Royalstar Resources Ltd. (Royalstar) and Paramount Ventures and Finance Inc. (Paramount), 400,000 common shares of the Company if, within two years of the agreement date, the Company concludes that the Kasperske Hory property can be brought into commercial production. If the above two year period expires without the Company issuing the shares or the Company notifies the companies that the Kasperske Hory property does not contain an orebody which the Company wishes to bring into commercial production, Royalstar and Paramount have the right to repurchase their respective shares held by the Company at their original cost to the Company, plus an amount equal to 50% of the total cost incurred by the Company. As described in note 15 (b), the commitment to Royalstar has been settled.

<A NAME= "Note16"></A><P><B>16. Differences Between Canadian and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</B><BR>

	The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada (Canadian GAAP). In the Companys case United States generally accepted accounting principles, (U.S. GAAP), differ materially from Canadian GAAP in the accounting for income taxes.

	<P>The Company adopted SFAS 109 in 1993 for purposes of U.S. GAAP. SFAS 109 requires that the deferred taxes be provided for differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability, and the amounts reported in an entitys financial statements.

	<P>As a result of SFAS 109, both mining property, plant and equipment and deferred income taxes in the balance sheet would be increased by $29,725,000 at December 31, 1995, (December 31, 1994  $21,565,000). In the statement of earnings, depreciation and depletion would be increased by $1,256,000, (1994  $1,633,000; 1993  $961,000), and income and mining taxes decreased by the same amount. This difference does not impact overall net earnings.

	<P>As well, SFAS 109 requires that the annual adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect current tax rates. Under Canadian GAAP, deferred tax balances are maintained at the tax rate in effect in which the year they were first reported. The principal mines in which the Company has interests, commenced operations in recent years therefore deferred taxes have been provided for at rates which have not changed significantly to date. As a result, deferred taxes under SFAS 109 are not materially different from deferred taxes reported in the Companys financial statements.
