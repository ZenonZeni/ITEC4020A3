<B><P>Zone 3<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms-- Looking for a formula to spray my apple trees organically.  I've heard of using lime sulfur and BT, but I don't know what BT is.
Any help will be appreciated.</B></P>

<P>I have to admit to putting off answering this question, as it seems a
rather daunting task.  Also my experience is limited to the West Coast
and my answer will be from that perspective (ie. there may be apple pest
I am not aware of in other areas of the country).  Here goes:</P>

<P>A few basics to begin with.  The exact timing of some of these
applications will vary from region to region; check with your local
Agricultural Extension Service for the dates to anticipate the emergence
or likely activity of some of the pests in your area.  (Unfortunately, I
only know what zone you're in, and it covers a good part of the country)
I firmly believe that pesticides should only be used when they will do
some good.  It is important to understand the life cycle of the pests
you are trying to control rather than just spraying by the calendar.</P>

<P>In fact, a friend who owns a very large commercial/conventional raspberry
farm in southern Washington state began monitoring pest populations a
few years ago and timing spray applications according to need as opposed
to a calendar date.  The result?  He cut pesticide applications by 75%!!</P>

<P>That said, here are some suggestions for an organic program for apples:</P>

<P>Begin with a dormant spray program in the winter (after leaf drop
through mid winter).  A number of apple pests can be controled through
the use of a good dormant spray program. Often aphids, scale, and mite
eggs will stay on the tree through the winter and using a dormant oil
spray will help to kill these pests.  Many oils are approved for use in
organic farming--I prefer a product called Sunspray (a paraphinic oil).
It has performed very well on a wide variety of plants throughout the
year.  Other products would include petroleum based oils like Ortho's
Volck Oil or  Lilly Millers' Supreme Oil.  I recall that the Sunspray
can't be mixed with one of the dormant sprays though at the moment I
can't recall whether that was sulfur products or copper products.  One
advantage of the Volck type oils is that they can be used in combination
with the lime-sulfur products saving you the time and trouble of having
to make multiple applications.</P>

<P>The dormant sprays like lime sulfur or copper are used to control
diseases on the tree including scap and mildew.  These products kill on
contact.  I have always heard that the longer they are in contact with
the target organism the more effective the control.  I usually recommend
making several applications to ensure the best results.  Wait for a
period of dry weather so that the product is not washed off of the tree.
Rough dates for spraying might include Thanksgiving, New Years and
Valentines Day.  Easy to remember.</P>

<P>Be careful with the dormant sprays.  They are usually applied at very
high concentrations and would very likely damage non-deciduous plants
that might be growing under the trees.  Be sure to follow all the
directions on the label and wear the correct protective gear.  (The
biggest hazard is probably getting it in the eyes or irritation to the
skin.  To my knowledge you aren't faced with a big inhalation hazard.)</P>

<P>There is also a 'delayed dormant' spray time (approximately the
Valentines day spray above).  Generally sometime in March and April
around the time the blossoms swell. This application is particularly
important for controlling the fungi that attack the buds as they open
like scab or mildew.  As the buds begin to swell, but before you can see
any blossom, color use lime sulfur according to the directions (the
dilution rate may be a little lower than the full dormant
rate--unfortunately I don't have any labels in front of me to confirm
this...).  If you have had a big problem with scab or mildew another
application can be made at 'pink' or just as color begins to show in the
bud.  Again lime sulfur according to the directions.</P>

<P>Some spray schedules also call for an additional application of lime
sulfur at petal fall for mildew and scap control.  A couple of thoughts
on this.  One, this would definitely be at a summer dilution rate; a
dormant rate would be extremely harmful to the tree at this time.  Two.
if you haven't had a really severe problem with either of these diseases
you might not need to make this application.  Three, if you expect
unusually hot weather with temperatures above 85 degrees do not use
sulfur sprays.</P>

<P>Also in the delayed dormant period, a preventative oil spray can be
applied to control aphids, European Red Mites, and San Jose Scale to
name a few.  You could also substitute insecticidal soaps at this time.
Again, read the label and be sure that you are using the correct
dilution rate for the time of year.</P>

<P>At the prepink stage, you can make a soap application to prevent apple
aphid and scale.  If you have had a problem with 'stink bugs' you could
also apply sabadilla during this time period.</P>

<P>Prepink is also the time to begin to think about coddling moth controls
if you have a problem with that pest.  The best approach is to use
pheremone traps to monitor the populations and to time your sprays
accordingly.  I also know that the coddling moth is influenced by a
temperature trigger (First egg hatch usually occurs when 125 degree days
have accumulated from the first 62 degree F sunset.  One source I have
goes into how to make 'degree day' calculations.  If you sent me your
address, I could mail you a copy of it.) before it becomes active.  This
is the kind of info your extension service should be able to provide
you--what is the time frame when coddling moths typically become active
in this area?  NOTE:  If you do not and have not had a problem with
coddling moth do not use a pheremone trap.  You will almost certainly
have the problem after you hang the trap!  Otherwise, it is probably the
best way to know when to spray other than the temperature indicators I
mentioned.</P>

<P>Products to control the coddling moth include "ryania with fish oil"
(from one growers catalog) to diazinon--decidedly non organic.  I know
that a graduate student in the Agroecology at the University of
California Santa Cruz was looking at the pyrethrum products for use in
controlling the moth and was having a great deal of success.
Unfortunately I haven't seen her in ten years, and never heard the
outcome of her research project.  The challenge with the moth is
controlling it before it gets into your fruit.  Timing is everything
particularly with organic products as they do not have the longevity of
the synthetic pesticides.  Coddling moth can also go through several
generations so repeat applications may be necessary.</P>

<P>One suggestion would be to keep an eye on the eggs which are typically
lain on the fruit or on a nearby leaf.  They are laid singly and are
disk shaped, opaque white, and a little difficult to spot.  They later
develop a red ring, and just before hatching the black head of the
caterpillar becomes visible.</P>

<P>If your trees are isolated from other apples by more than a mile, you
could try mass trapping.  Hang a lot of traps in the trees and catch all
the males before they can mate.  This is not a good idea though if you
are in an area with a lot of other apples close by.  Coddling moth also
attacks pears, walnuts and plums.  This is a fairly labor intensive
method, and I will save a discussion of it unless you are interested.
(Email me and I'll send you the additional info.)</P>

<P>There has also been some work using pheremone twist ties to control
pest.  The idea is to flood the insect sensory organs with sexual
pheremones so that they are completely confused and unable to find a
mate.  I don't know if there have been any in-roads with this technique
in coddling moth control, or if the ties are available to consumers.</P>

<P>Here is where the Bt comes in.  Bt or Bacillus thurengensis is a
microbial insecticide that controls members of the Lepidoptera family,
also known as moths and butterflies.  Some organic growers do use it to
control coddling moth.  Success requires 9 to 15 very carefully timed
applications per season.  You have to apply the product just around the
time the larva begin to emerge from the eggs and before they burrow into
the fruit.  I am not sure that this is the best method.</P>

<P>One source I have ('Pests of the Garden and Small Farm'--U California
Press) makes the following comments: "Botanical and microbial
insecticides and oils are most likely to provide acceptable control in
orchards that have low populations of coddling moth to begin with.
Therefore, they should always be used in combination with the various
cultural methods (coming up)...Orchards with very heavy populations
...and many nearby sources of infestation will be very difficult to
manage without more toxic pesticides."</P>

<P>Here are the cultural controls.  Some of the larva will overwinter in
protected areas on the tree.  Clean up any loose bark and give those
parts of the tree a thorough application of a dormant oil spray.  In the
spring, clean up any fallen fruits within a couple of days.  Many of the
fruit dropped by the tree may be attacked by the first generation of
caterpillars in May or June.  There is some evidence that collecting
them and destroying them can have a significant impact on the subsequent
generations.</P>

<P>Another technique which I have seen used and which proved successful was
trunk banding.  Essentially the idea is to trap mature larvae as they
move down the trunk in a band of tanglefoot, burlap, or corrugated
cardboard.  In the particular instance that I was involved with, we use
corrugated cardboard backed with foam strips--like weatherizing strips.
These were attached firmly to the tree with the foam acting as a gasket
between the tree and the cardboard.  Use 2 inch wide strips of 'Flute A'
cardboard and wrap around the tree so that the corrugation tubes are
vertical.  The larva crawl into the cardboard and pupate.  The idea is
to remove and destroy the strips regularly, thereby killing the pupating
larva.  Ideally the strips should go on the lower portion of the tree
where the bark is smoothest.  Timing?  Well in coastal California where
I first encountered this method, we put the bands up by the end of May,
removed them around the last week of June (725 degree days after egg
laying) and burned them.  We then checked for and destroyed any pupae we
could find on the trunk.  We put bands up again in August and removed
and destroyed them sometime between November and January.  This worked
very well for us!  It is much more effective on smooth barked varieties.
On trees with really rough bark the larva will often find a place to
pupate long before they reach the bands.</P>

<P>Finally, the secret to those incredible $5 apples in Japan is bagging
them.  This is also good for preventing coddling moth damare.  After
thinning the tree tie double paper bags around the individual fruit that
remain.  Leave on until three weeks before harvest (peek inside the bags
to check the fruit)  Remove the outer bags leaving special translucent
bags over the fruit.  About a week later, remove the inner bag and let
the fruit color up.  You should be able to harvest about two weeks
later.  Here is a source on the bags:  AppleCorps, 700 13th ST. NE, East
Wenatchee, WA 98802 (509)86-9204.  Cost around $10 for 100 bags
including shipping.</P>

<P>So much on coddling moth!?!?  Hey, it is in my mind the worst of the
apple pests!  Who likes to bite into an apple with a big 'ole nasty worm
in it...</P>

<P>Where was I?  Oh, yeah, petal fall...If apple maggots are a problem, you
can use red spheres treated with a sticky substance to trap them.  These
are effective controls for this particular pest and are fairly easy to
find in a good progressive independent nursery or by mail order.</P>

<P>Another lime sulfur application could be made for scabor mildew if needed
at petal fall too.</P>

<P>From 14-28 days after full bloom yet another spray for mildew or scab if
needed.  If aphids become a problem, use soap sprays or summer dilution's
of oils.  You can also release predators like green lacewings if you
want.</P>

<P>Spring and summer follow the many guidelines for coddling moth.  If
mites or scale appear, oil sprays are your best bet.  Again soaps for
aphids.</P>

<P>That gets us to the fall and a copper sulfate or Bordeaux mix if you
have problems with anthracnose.</P>

<P>And then, start again at the top....</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- Why is chicken manure not recommended for trees?  We are planting apples and pears in heavy clay soil.</P></B>
<P>Generally, the concern is that chicken manure releases the nutrients it
contains very quickly--usually about 90% in the first year.  Because of
this, there is some danger of burning.  This is particularly true with bare
root trees.  All those tender new roots don't always appreciate the high
concentration of nutrients and the associated salts often found in manure.</P>

<P>As a rule, I would not recommend manure for use when planting trees with the
following exceptions:</P>

<P>If it is extremely well aged like very old horse manure, well composted
(like our Steer Manure), or very unlikely to burn like rabbit manure then it
would be OK to use when planting trees and shrubs.  But I would amend the
whole area prior to planting and then dig the hole and plant the tree.  (See
our article on tree planting in the last issue of our newsletter or at our
web site--remember--the new thinking is shallow and broad for trees not
narrow and deep...)  If the manure seems hot to the touch, smells of
ammonia, throws off steam in the morning don't use it. But if it smells like
rich freshly turned soil (or really good compost) go ahead and use it.</P>

<P>With chicken, you could use it to top dress the trees.  After the soil has
warmed up, and they have had a chance to get some roots established--say
midsummer in your climate zone (mid July) you could spread a 1/2 inch to an
inch around your trees, keeping it off of the crown of the tree and
spreading it around the root zone to a little beyond the drip line.  If you
use it this way, and allow the natural effects of rainfall or irrigation to
move the nutrients down to the roots you should have nothing to worry about
and very happy trees!</P>

<P>One last note, if you are planting very large trees like standard trees or
trees on only semi dwarfing root stock (M111 for example) you will be better
off not amending the soil too heavily in your heavy clay and then mulching
around the tree to encourage the development of finer soils.  Research in
the last few years has shown pretty definitively that with larger trees the
more the soil is like the native soil the better the tree will do in the
long run--no shock to the roots as they move from a super rich planting hole
to the poorer native soil.  If you are planting trees that are on very
dwarfing rootstocks (M9) go ahead and amend as much as you would like.</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- What about a fuzzy gray fungus on my plums
and how do I control it.</P></B>


<P>To answer your question, it sounds like one of two things.  It could be
brown rot or powdery mildew.</P>

<P>Brown Rot:  Do small circular brown spots appear on the young fruit?  Do the
spots enlarge as the season progresses to rot part or all of the fruit.  Do
tufts of gray spores cover the fruit in moist weather?  When you slice open
the fruit do you find brown, firm and fairly dry flesh?  Does the infected
fruit drop prematurely or dry, turn dark brown, and remain on the tree past
the normal harvest period?</P>

<P>Powdery Mildew:  Do gray-white powdery patches occur on the leaves?  Is new
growth curled, stunted, and distorted?  Do infected buds shrivel and open
later than usual?  Are infected leaves brittle and do they often die?  Is
the fruit small and misshapen?  Is it russet colored or covered with white
powdery patches?</P>

<P>A key difference--brown rot will produce spores in moist weather, where as
powdery mildew is often killed in the presence of free moisture.</P>

<P>The controls will be similar.  First, if you do not already do so, I would
encourage you to get into the habit of using a dormant spray on your fruit
trees in the winter.  Look for products containing lime sulfur and use
according to the label instructions every winter.  This can be very
effective at reducing the population of organisms over wintering on the
plant.  When combined with an oil spray, it will also help control
populations of insects as well.</P>

<P>There are a couple of cultural techniques that can help as well--less
applicable for you perhaps, as you are dealing with established trees.  1)
For mildew prevention, plant trees in full sun.  Prune to encourage air
circulation.  Remove or relocate any roses from near the trees as they
provide an alternate host for mildew.  2)  For Brown Rot, pick up and destroy
all 'mummies'--the damaged fruit.  Prune to encourage air circulation and to
allow for thorough spray coverage.  Prune out and destroy any wood showing
signs of infection--twig dieback, sunken lesions on the twigs and branches,
a sticky ooze, and dead twigs.  Clean up and destroy all debris around the
tree.  Avoid wetting blossoms with overhead irrigation.</P>

<P>Finally, here are the sprays and approximate timing to use to control these
problems.  On the organic, less toxic side you can use sulfur or lime sulfur
sprays.  Be sure to use at the recommended rates for summer applications.
You will notice that dormant rates are significantly higher than summer
rates.  (If you were to use a winter rate, you would burn all the foliage.)
Be careful not to use sulfur sprays during periods of hot weather.</P>

<P>Otherwise, in the chemical arsenal you have your choice of products.  The
following control both pests:  benomyl or chlorothalonil (Daconil). Follow
the directions on the label.</P>

<P>Timing:  For Brown Rot you can use a bordeaux or copper containing fungicide
at budswell (in early spring, you will see the buds on the branches begin to
swell noticeably prior to opening); spray with a fungicide during blooming
(sulfur might harm blossoms so be careful) and respray 10 days later.  To
protect maturing plums, spray about 3 weeks before harvest.</P>

<P>For powdery mildew, apply lime sulfur or sulfur sprays at 2 week intervals,
beginning when buds start to open (they will show faint green tips), until
small green fruit are present.  Another recommendation is to spray trees at
regular intervals of 10 to 14 days until 3 to 4 weeks after the petals have
fallen form the blossoms.  Resume whenever the mildew reappears.</P>

<P>You might also keep your eye out for a new product by a company called
Greenlight.  They will have a Neem (a tree in India with natural
insecticidal and fungicidal properties) based spray labeled for vegetables
(and I hope fruit trees).  I have seen their ornamental version of the
product called Rose Defense, and it controlled both insects and powdery
mildew on roses.  Given that plums are in the same family I am hoping that
their vegetable formulation will have the same properties.  One note, unlike
other neem products this one is a 90% concentration of neem oil--hence its
much broader range of applications.</P>
