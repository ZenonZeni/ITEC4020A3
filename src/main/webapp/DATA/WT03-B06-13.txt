NATIONAL'S CHALLENGES DON'T THREATEN REFORMS

     Prime Minister Jim Bolger and his National Party will have to
overcome serious obstacles in order to remain in power over the next
five years.  A new proportional voting system, which will give
smaller parties a larger number of seats in Parliament, and disarray
within the National Party may result in a coalition government led by
either Labour or the Alliance Party, which is an amalgamation of
politicians who have left the two major parties.  Tensions over
immigrants and the rights of the Maori, members of the indigenous
population, could result in limited violence and also a voter
backlash against the party in power.  Despite the expected steady
growth and low inflation, high unemployment will remain a problem and
little improvement in living standards will be achieved.  A coalition
government led by Labour or Alliance would carry out more fiscal
expansion than would a National government, but unless the most
extreme members of the Alliance dominated policy, would not reverse
most of the market reforms that have been implemented since 1985.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  NEW ZEALAND

June 28, 1995     A new political party, United New Zealand (UNZ),
                  was formed under the leadership of Clive
                  Matthewson.

July 17, 1995     The governor of the New Zealand Reserve Bank, Don
                  Brash, was forced to warn the financial markets
                  again of the dire consequences if they continued
                  to challenge his anti-inflation campaign.

July 20, 1995     The question of whether New Zealand needs a tough
                  code to control corporate takeover activity caused
                  serious dissension in the Cabinet and the business
                  community.

October 2, 1995   The new Zealand government announced plans to
                  privatize one of the state~s last big assets, a
                  large area of North Island State forests.
