  This study attempted to quantify diagnostic characteristics related to 
consonant production of developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD) in 11 Dutch 
children (ages 6 and 7).  The study was able to quantify diagnostic 
characteristics but found very few qualitative differences in error patterns 
between children with DVD and 11 age-matched children with normal speech.

  This paper identifies characteristics of poor speechreaders, defines 
developmental dyspraxia in profoundly hearing-impaired children, and outlines 
the speechreading process.  An active training method is described in which 
expressive and receptive skills are integrated, by having hearing-impaired 
people speechread their own speech via videotape recording and playback.  (JDD)<BR>

  A rationale and procedures are presented for occupational therapy evaluation 
of the preschooler whose problems suggest dyspraxia.  Two evaluative domains 
are examined: sensory processing (assessment of tactile, proprioceptive, 
vestibular, auditory and visual functions) and praxis (ideation, motor planning 
and execution).  Procedures include standardized test items, parent interviews, 
and behavior observation.  (Author/KM)<BR>

  A group of 182 children (ages four through nine) with known or suspected 
sensory integrative dysfunction were assessed using tests and clinical 
observations to examine developmental dyspraxia.  The study did not justify the 
existence of either a unitary function or different types of developmental 
dyspraxia.  (Author/CH)<BR>

  The Adapted Cuing Technique (ACT) was created to accompany oral stimulus 
presentation in treatment of dyspraxia.  ACT is consistent with current 
treatment theory, emphasizing patterns of articulatory movement, manner of 
production, and multimodality facilitation.  A case study describes the use of 
ACT in the treatment of a five-year-old child.  (Author/CL)<BR>

  This pamphlet presents an overview of speech and language disorders including 
a description of symptoms, possible causes, identification, intervention, and 
current research.  Description of the disorders includes examples of symptoms; 
the four components and the physical tools of speech; and the role of the 
brain, including its hemispheres, problems during maturation, and its language 
centers.  Examples are given of speech disorders (phonological impairment, 
verbal dyspraxia, and dysarthria); language disorders (form errors, content 
errors, and use errors) and expressive and receptive language disorders.  The 
concept of delay versus disorder is discussed.  The process of handicap 
identification is described, noting conditions which must be ruled out and 
stressing the importance of early identification and intervention.  Current 
methods of therapy are described, and research is cited indicating that speech 
disorders may be outgrown by adolescence but that difficulties involving 
language use may persist into adulthood.  Ongoing research involves 
investigation of differences in brain organization, investigation of the 
genetic connection, and the use of computers to train children with language 
impairments to process speech and language more rapidly.  Seven organizations 
are listed to write or call for additional information.  A chart of language 
milestones for ages one through six is also provided.  (BRM)<BR>

  Of particular concern to educational psychologists when assessing hearing-
impaired children is the identification of learning difficulties in addition to 
deafness which might hinder progress with language development.  This study 
sought to replicate research which showed that some deaf children who have 
difficulty with fine motor movements and body image also have difficulty with 
speech musculature and thus with language learning by purely oral methods, and 
research which showed that relatively large percentages of deaf children 
exhibit dyspraxic features.  A battery of diagnostic tests was administered to 
106 British school-aged hearing-impaired children to detect dyspraxia.  Only a 
small number of children were identified, and the main profiles emerging on 12 
dyspraxia subtests differed from the profiles of former research subjects.  The 
link between fine motor, speech, and certain memory tests was not replicated.  
The eupraxic/dyspraxic profile did not emerge for the subjects.  (Author/JDD)
