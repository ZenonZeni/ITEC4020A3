<P>Consider these advantages for extending your young person's education at home.<BR>

<P><ol><B>If you home school your teens:</B><BR>

<P><li>You get to see the completion of your earlier home-school efforts.</li><BR>
<li>You can customize your teen's education to provide motivation and development for their gifts and abilities. No one else will be able to provide the consistent and loving support in weak areas that you can.</li><BR>
<li>You can start higher education early.</li><BR>
<li>You can continue the family building process.  Teen continue to be in their impressionable and formative years.  This is an invaluable time to cement all your family relationships.</li><BR>
<li>You can be sure your teens are learning if they are at home.  Studies have revealed that public high school students average only two hours and 13 minutes of academic work a day.</li><BR>
<li>You can continue to have influence over their peer relationships.  Teen rebellion is not in God's plan for the family.</li><BR>
<li>You can protect them from pressure to conform to what the other kids are doing.  You won't need to spend time de-programming.</li><BR>
<li>Home school is the best preparation for higher education.  The home education &quot;style&quot; is closer to college type instruction.</li><BR>
<li>There is greater flexibility for work/study opportunities.</li><BR>
<li>Home educators have the best available curriculum and greater selection.</li><BR>

<P><B>If you send your teens to high school:</B><BR>

<P><li>Public schools offer revisionist history and science that promote a humanist perspective.  The godly commitment of many great Americans has been deleted from public textbooks. </li><BR>
<li>The institutional method of public education is designed around &quot;crowd control&quot; not learning.  If and when they learn it will be a by-product of other priorities to maintain class room order.</li><BR>
<li>There will be a diversion away from your academic focus as well as spiritual priorities.  Be aware of the many distractions that won't parallel your home life.</li><BR>
<li>Your young people will be thrown into things like preoccupation with boy/girl relationships, focus on clothes, and pressure to conform in appearance and music.</li><BR>
<li>Vast amounts of time separated from the family will affect their relationship with you.  We have all put great amounts of our heart and time into our home-school years, and we want those efforts preserved.</li><BR>
<li>Age/grade isolation or segregation inhibits normal socialization.  Public school children are behind their home-school counterparts in maturity, socialization, and vocabulary development, as demonstrated by available research.</li></ol><BR>
