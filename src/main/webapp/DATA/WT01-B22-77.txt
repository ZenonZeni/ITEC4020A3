<h3 align="center">FIBRE PLANTS -- HEMP </h3>

<h4>We all know hemp as a roadside weed, tall, straight, with
whorls of spreading, lady-finger leaves, all pitched at a
downward slant, the flowers clustered at the bases of the leaves,
as happens with all members of the stinging nettle family, to
which hemp belongs.</h4>

<h4>Wild hemp, as it grows escaped from cultivation, and in its
native region, western Asia, has poor fibre. But in the hemp
fields of Russia, Austria, Turkey, Italy, China, Japan, and the
United States, it may reach ten, and even twenty feet in height. </h4>

<h4>The fibres of the inner bark, when properly separated, come
out creamy-white, soft, pliable, and with a silky sheen. It is
substituted for linen in all but the better grades in the north
of Italy, where methods of cultivation and curing produce the
best quality of fibre.</h4>

<h4>The great hemp region of this country is the Blue Grass
region in Kentucky, where a rich, moist, well-drained loam
overlies limestone. The seed is sowed and rolled, but not
cultivated after it comes up. The vigorous plants get the start
of the weeds and kill them out. The roots plow deep, and the
stems soar.</h4>

<h4>When the flowers appear and the tops turn yellow, then comes
the harvest. The stems are cut as low as possible, for the best
fibre is at the base. The September sun dries the stalks that lie
with butts down hill on the grass. In a week they are gathered
into small bundles, tied, shocked, or stacked. </h4>

<h4>In November the stems are spread for two months so that
moisture and frost rot the outer bark and woody center of the
stems from the fibrous layer. This &quot;retting&quot; is
sometimes done in water. </h4>

<h4>When the fibre separates easily, the stalks are set up to
dry. The old-fashioned hand-breaks are used to
&quot;decorticate&quot; the fibre, and clean it of the fragments
of bark and wood left after the breaking is done. The freed fibre
is tied in hanks, and these are baled for market. After being
hackled it goes to the twine factory. Often the hemp-grower
clears $30 to $60 an acre, after cost of growing is deducted. And
the land is left in better condition than before the hemp was
planted. </h4>

<h4>The British navy consumes a quantity of hemp fibre in the
manufacture of the bags in which coal is carried. Sail cloth,
coarse sheetings and canvas, carpet warp and rugs, fish lines and
nets, and all kinds of twines and ropes are made of hemp. Hemp
seed is not ripe when the canes are right for fibre, so special
plots are grown for seed, which is valuable as poultry food. Oil
for paint is extracted from the seed. The plants are best grown
in hills so that they have room to branch and produce the
greatest amount of seed. The seed crop often nets the farmer
almost as much as if he grew hemp fibre.</h4>

<h4>In the Far East the resinous substance in flowers and leaves
of hemp is a commercial product in great demand. In various
forms, to drink, to chew, and to smoke, the intoxicating drug is
universally used. The bhang is the dried leaves and fruits. It
may be mixed with tobacco, for smoking, or with honey and spices,
for a kind of candy, or steeped like tea. Hasheesh is the name it
is known by in Turkey and Syria. Hasheesh cakes, often huge in
size, are sold in the bazaars. The effect of hasheesh is
pleasantly stimulating at first; then follows loss of sensation,
dulling of pain, and sleep with pleasant dreams. The result of
constant use of the drug may be insanity.</h4>
