<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><b>June 1996</b>
<p><b><i>LDA is concerned about the numbers of individuals with learning 
disabilities who have not learned to read and are currently not learning
to read in school.</i></b> According to the U.S. Department of Education,
1 in 5 American adults is functionally illiterate. Three-fourths of the 
unemployed lack sufficient skills to function successfully in the
nation's work force. There are many reasons for illiteracy - one cause 
is neurologically-based learning disabilities which have not been recognized 
and/or dealt with appropriately. 

<p>Many children, including children with learning disabilities, do not
learn to read in the first grade because they lack the basic readiness skills 
or the school's method is not appropriate for them.  They may be allowed
to fail for two or three years without effective intervention. Unless these 
children are identified early and appropriate instruction provided they 
may be passed along in school until basic reading instruction is no longer 
available. Quality reading programs must be available across the age range if 
we are to significantly reduce illiteracy. While accommodations may be
appropriate, they must not be substituted for direct reading instruction. 

<p>Common educational practice is for schools and adult literacy programs to 
adopt a single method for teaching reading, with the assumption that it will 
be effective for everyone. Research indicates that some students with
learning disabilities need a multisensory phonics approach, with instruction 
in phonological awareness; some students need a more meaning-based approach; 
while other students need interventions to address comprehension problems. For 
many students a combination of approaches is effective. <b>LDA EMPHASIZES THAT 
NO SINGLE READING METHOD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH LEARNING 
DISABILITIES.</b>

<p>LDA believes that illiteracy is a national crisis. It is LDA's position 
that to effect a significant increase in reading achievement for all people the 
following elements must be in place:
<ul>
<li>a variety of methods for teaching reading in schools (in regular and 
    special education) and in adult literacy programs,
<li>intensive teaching of reading, written language, and spelling in 
    elementary and secondary schools,
<li>screening and diagnostic programs to identify students with reading 
    disabilities,
<li>evaluation of program effectiveness that goes beyond mandated periodic 
    testing,
<li>teacher certification requirements for elementary, secondary and special 
    education teachers include substantive courses in reading methodologies,
<li>individualized reading programs for students with learning disabilities, and
<li>a strong commitment to research which will identify causes/prevention of 
    reading failure and effective interventions. 
</ul>

<p>LDA recognizes that reading is crucial to success in school, to realizing 
one's potential, and to becoming a productive member of society. Therefore, 
every person must be given the opportunity to learn to read. Appropriate 
reading programs must be available to all ages... <b><i>it is never too late 
to learn to read.</i></b><br>
