<title>New York DSM Successes</title>

<H3>4. New York DSM Successes<BR>
 </H3>
     
DSM programs in New York provided net life-cycle energy savings to 
customers of $1.4 billion during the period 1990 to 1994.<a href="#106" name="r106"> [ 106 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="ConsolidatedEdison">Consolidated Edison</a>. </B></I>Consolidated Edison's 
"Commercial & Industrial Efficient Lighting Incentives Program" provides 
commercial and industrial customers with lighting rebates of 25 cents per 
watt of lighting load removed for fluorescent ballast upgrades.  Lighting 
control devices are rebated at 10 cents per watt of connected lighting 
load.  Under the Shared Energy Savings financing approach, Con Edison 
provides up-front installation costs with customer repayment derived from 
energy savings over a payback period of up to five years.  Under this 
approach, Con Edison recovers its costs while customers receive the 
benefits of an immediate positive cash flow from energy savings without 
any capital outlay requirements.  From 1990 through 1994, the program 
achieved approximately 1,251 gigawatt-hours of annualized energy savings 
and 311 megawatts of system peak reductions, cutting carbon dioxide 
emissions by 587,970 metric tons.<a href="#107" name="r107"> [ 107 ] </a>
<p>     Con Edison's "Commercial & Industrial High Efficiency Motor Incentive 
Program" encourages commercial and industrial customers to install 
high-efficiency electric motors and variable frequency drives (VFDs).  Con 
Edison pays $10 per horsepower for motors meeting the utility's minimum 
efficiency standards, which fully offsets the differential equipment cost 
incurred by customers.  The current incentive level for VFDs is either $50 
or $90 per horsepower depending upon the pump and fan HVAC application.  
Here again, a Shared Energy Savings approach is offered as an alternative 
to rebates.  From 1990 through 1994, this successful program saved 
approximately 137 gigawatt-hours in annualized energy and reduced the 
system peak by approximately 5 megawatts, and cut carbon dioxide emissions 
by 64,390 metric tons.<BR>
<p>     Con Edison's "Dealer Incentive Programs" are point-of-purchase 
incentive programs for retail businesses that sell energy-efficient 
appliances and equipment.  Con Edison encourages retail salespeople and 
their managers to sell high-efficiency units, such as air conditioners and 
refrigerators, by awarding credits which are redeemable for merchandise or 
travel.  No direct incentives are offered to customers.  The program is 
transforming the appliance and equipment market: appliance dealers have 
substantially increased their stock of highly-efficient appliances. From 
1990 through 1994, this and other of Con Edison's residential DSM programs 
have saved approximately 60 gigawatt-hours in annualized energy and 
reduced the system peak by approximately 28 megawatts, cutting carbon 
dioxide emissions by 28,200 metric tons.<BR>
<p>     Other Con Edison DSM programs include the "Commercial & Industrial 
High-Efficiency Electric Space Conditioning Incentive Program," "Steam 
Air-Conditioning Program," "Commercial & Industrial Customized 
Energy-Efficiency Program," "Curtailable Electric Service Program," 
"Residential Compact Fluorescent Program," and "Residential Submetering 
Program."  Con Edison's DSM programs have saved over 1,800 gigawatt-hours 
on an annualized basis during the 1990-1994 period, with associated peak 
demand savings of about 585 megawatts.  The programs have avoided 846,000 
metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.<a href="#108" name="r108"> [ 108 ] </a>
