<B>Project Title: E/HEV Emissions Studies<p>
Performing Organization: Natural Resources Defense Council

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>In this program, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has led a two-phase effort to analyze and characterize the emissions associated with the operations of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and the relative emission reduction benefits of using these vehicles instead of gasoline-powered vehicles.  In the first phase, completed in June, 1994, NRDC and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) researchers analyzed six different scenarios of varying electric vehicle sales, vehicle efficiency levels and miles driven, and recharging patterns in California.  Under these scenarios, NRDC and EDF compared the tailpipe emissions from a gasoline-powered vehicle meeting ultra-low emission vehicle standards with the emissions from the mix of electrical power generation sources serving Southern California.  The report found that electric vehicles (EVs) reduce emissions of reactive organic gases and nitrogen oxides - the main precursors of ozone - by 97-99%, compared to gasoline-powered vehicles.  EVs also reduce the emissions of carbon monoxide, a pollutant with significant human health impacts, by similar amounts.  EVs were also found to emit 49-66% less carbon dioxide than the 31 miles-per-gallon (mpg) gasoline cars and 21 mpg trucks evaluated.  The fuel efficiency of these gasoline-powered vehicles would need to rise to 91 mpg and 41.5 mpg respectively, to match the electric vehicles analyzed.</P>

<P>In Phase 2 of this program, the NRDC will analyze the potential emissions benefits of heavy-duty hybrid electric drive-trains for trucks and buses.  This study will determine whether hybrid technology can improve the greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions associated with dedicated natural gas and advanced diesel bus and truck engines.  The study will quantify the emissions and fuel economy benefits of hybrid engines in their most promising heavy-duty applications, and compare these benefits to dedicated electric battery, natural gas and diesel technologies.</P>
