CAR TALK AUTOPSY REVEALS PERILS OF ENDEMIC DISTRUST

      President Clinton's October 1993 Climate Change Action Plan
established several projects, including "Car Talk," a collaborative
process that was originally designed "to develop measures to
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor
vehicles, including cars and light trucks."  
      Unfortunately, Car Talk was marred by suspicion and distrust
which eventually led to its failure, George Eads told an audience at a
recent seminar, "Car Talk: An Autopsy Report," sponsored by Resources
for the Future (RFF).  Eads is a former Car Talk Committee member and
is now an economic consultant for RFF.
      Many of the groups participating in this failed effort are now
joined in the Common Sense Initiative, the Ozone Transport Assessment
Group and other co-operative ventures that are seeking cost-effective
solutions to environmental problems.
      One of the two committees with input into Car Talk was a
presidentially appointed Advisory Committee of representatives of the
auto industry, environmental community, state and local government and
"others with potential solutions to offer."  
      In growing to include 29 members, that committee was an unwieldy
grouping that included members with only tangential interest in the
issue, said Eads.
      The Advisory Committee was charged with developing
"recommendations on sets of policies that would, if adopted, most
cost-effectively obtain a return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas
emissions from personal motor vehicles by the years 2005, 2015 and
2025, with no return thereafter."
      However, its efforts were hindered from the start by lack of
trust.   "This theme of lack of trust ran through the Advisory
Committee's entire existence," Eads explained.  "Many had been
adversaries for 25 years or more and were on opposite sides of many
issues even while the Car Talk process was going on." 
      This distrust was compounded by "actions large and small
throughout the life of the Advisory Committee that helped destroy any
spirit of trust that might have begun to grow." 
      A three-way impasse developed that pitted automakers, the
petroleum industry and environmentalists/government officials.  
Automakers refused to support any policy setting automatic "direct"
actions, such as CAFE standards or "feebates."  The petroleum industry
rejected any policy involving gasoline tax increases.  The third
coalition resisted "any policy that didn't support some `direct'
instrument that would, in their view, have provided `certainty' of
fuel economy improvements," Eads said.
      Although a draft final report was issued and members submitted
comments, no final report was produced.  Instead, two groups produced
final statements: 
      (1) Automakers wrote a letter explaining why they could not agree
to the report and attached a version they would accept; and 
      (2) A group of 17 members put together a "majority report," which
they asked the Interagency Steering Goup to submit to the president. 
Subsequently, it was "back to business as usual," Eads said.

Roads Not Taken

      According to Eads, three "roads not taken" could have achieved
some of Car Talk's early goals:
      1. A voluntary commitment towards reducing fuel consumption,
similar to the one set forth on March 22, 1995, in Germany to "reduce
the average fuel consumption of passenger cars and multi-purpose
vehicles produced and sold in Germany by the year 2005 by 25%, based
on 1990 levels."
      2. A pricing mechanism combined with a regulatory backstop, such
as a fuel tax or vehicle miles traveled, which could come into effect
if deadlines were not met.  While this "absolute" form was
unacceptable to automakers, Eads claims that a "conditional" version
could have been adopted.
      3. An agreement to disagree, which outlined areas of general
consensus while acknowledging that some members opposed certain
points.  This did not materialize, however, because of the pervasive
lack of trust among participants as well as member fears that signing
the document could lead to repercussions later on.
      "Collaborative processes, especially ones involving long-time
opponents, require great attention to confidence building.  Confidence
building takes time and the right environment," Eads pointed out. 
Among his recommendations:
      * Long-time opponents must resist temptations to take "cheap
shots."
      * Confidences must be scrupulously observed -- even minor ones.
      * Opportunities must exist for private, off-the-record meetings
      and for activities that are not really threatening but that
      involve some minor degree of risk-taking. 
      * All parties must have interest in seeing projects succeed --
      or, at least, not fail.

EPA'S 1996 AGENDA HOLDS A MIXED BAG FOR REFINERS AND MARKETERS

   Although U.S. EPA resounded its commitment to streamline and
simplify environmental regulations in its 1996 agenda published in the
Federal Register, the agency will add new rules to its repertoire,
including some that will cost refiners and marketers.  
   Some top items on the list curb heavy-duty vehicle pollution,
finalize emissions trading and review national air quality standards.
   Regulations that could be helpful to refiners include:
   * Emissions trading:  The agency will advance its open-market
emissions trading intended to minimize transaction costs and harness
the power of the marketplace to enhance air quality, the agency said. 
It will issue a final policy and model rule for open-market trading of
ozone smog precursors, primarily volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
and NOx by June 1996.
   The program promises to provide more flexibility for companies to
trade emission credits without prior state or federal approval, EPA
reported. 
   * New source review: The agency will propose to simplify and
streamline the new source review program, which requires newly built
facilities or those undergoing major modifications to obtain an air
quality permit.  By excluding from the new source program activities
that have very little impact on air pollution, the program is expected
to save the industry at least $6 million per year, the agency
reported. 
   * Compliance-assurance monitoring program:  EPA is planning to
propose a rule to introduce additional flexibility into its
compliance-assurance monitoring, expected to be completed by July
1996.  A major departure from the agency's "command and control"
tactics, the rule would shift the burden of performance monitoring to
regulated sources, which would also "take proactive steps to minimize
emission exceedences."
   However, other regulations may potentially require significant new
investments by refiners and marketers, such as a national ambient air
pollution review that will likely spark changes in either fuel or
stationary source emission requirements, a more stringent diesel fuel
specification or changes in underground storage tanks.  Regulations
refiners should look out for include:    
   * National ambient air quality:  The agency plans to review the
standards for sulfur dioxide, ozone and particulate matter (PM).  "The
ozone and particulate matter reviews seek to incorporate new
scientific and technical information that has become available since
the last reviews," the agency reported.  Since 1987, when PM was last
reviewed, a growing body of scientific information associates PM with
excessive death rates, even at levels below the existing 24-hour
standard.  "The sulfur dioxide review...is intended to determine
whether further protection for certain exposed individuals is needed."
   * Mobile heavy-duty engine emissions:  EPA expects to issue a
formal rule proposal in February 1996, after issuing an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking Aug. 30 for public comment on requiring
additional nitrogen oxide, hydrocarbon and particulate matter
reductions for heavy-duty highway engines, model year 2004 and beyond.
   * 49-state car: EPA will issue its national low-emission vehicle
(NLEV) program this month.  Tests are underway to determine whether
the 49-state vehicle, modeled after California's, will also require a
California-style fuel that is equally low in sulfur.  Some question
whether the higher national fuel sulfur levels may impair the
catalytic converter and advances on-board diagnostics, such as the
OBD-II systems now under development.
   * Federal test procedures:  Will be developed for motor vehicle
emissions.
   * Toxics Release Inventory:  Expansion of the list of facilities
that must report under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-
Know law, including oil and gas producers and materials recovery,
among others.  
   * Underground tanks:  Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, EPA expects to issue in December 1996 a final rule to exempt from
hazardous waste management requirements petroleum-contaminated soil,
ground water and debris resulting from underground tank cleanups.  A
temporary exemption for such contaminated media is already in place
and has no sunset date.

RFG BENEFITS IN ATLANTA MAY BE OUTWEIGHED BY COSTS

   The debate over the use of RFG or low-Rvp gasoline in Atlanta
continued last month, as a BP Oil official noted that the area
considered the federal program but decided against RFG use.
   "When Georgia was considering its fuel options in 1993 and 1994,
two factors influenced its decision against RFG," said Kenneth Alfred,
manager of clean fuels coordination for BP Oil.  "One was a concern
over NOx increases due to oxygenate use, and the other was cost."
   Concern remains that oxygenate use may increase NOx, said Alfred,
even though the U.S. EPA recently changed its thinking on the
relationship between oxygenate use and NOx emissions.  BP agrees with
the American Petroleum Institute that EPA has not proved that there
will be no NOx increases with increased summertime oxygenate use,
Alfred said.  "EPA did not use the appropriate modeling techniques to
reach its conclusions."
   Alfred offered these arguments:
   1.  Phase I Simple Model RFG has no NOx reduction requirement,
giving no assurance that it would help the Atlanta market to cut NOx.
   2.  Georgia air quality authorities recognized that Phase I RFG
would provide no NOx reduction benefits and only marginally more VOC
reductions than Atlanta's summer 7.0 psi Rvp requirement.
   3.  Carbon monoxide benefits are non-germane.  CO emissions are a 
wintertime issue, not a summer concern, and Atlanta does not have a CO
problem.
   While CO is included in modeling programs as an ozone precursor, it
only has a "minor impact" on ozone.  "It is a stretch to use it as a
selling point for RFG in this market," said Alfred.  "The Atlanta
market would be far better served by evaluation and implementation of
local stationary source NOx controls, which have been demonstrated to
be far more cost-effective than mobile source controls."

NYMEX CUTS RFG OXYGEN SPEC TO 1.5 WT% YEAR-ROUND

   The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) amended its futures
contract to 1.5 wt% for all 12 months beginning in March 1996.  From
November through February, NYMEX will allow delivery of RFG with an
oxygen content of 2.0 wt%, to be designated "Oxygenated Program RFG,"
but will not consider it a separate contract.
   "In our research, we found the 1.5% minimum oxygen RFG cash market
to be extremely active in New York Harbor," said NYMEX President R.
Patrick Thompson.  "These specifications will not only enable our
contract to reflect retail demand beyond the New York metropolitan
area in the greater Northeast corridor, but also will make it
consistent with the predominant RFG standard nationwide."
   The change will not affect NYMEX's dispute with the state of New
Jersey over the attempt by that state to end its oxy-fuel season this
year, spokeswoman Nachamah Jacobovits said.  New Jersey Department of
Envornmental Protection officials attempted to "cancel" the season at
the last minute without prior EPA approval, which would have cut
oxygen content to 2.0 wt% year-round instead of requiring 2.7 wt% in
the winter.  NYMEX won a suit against the DEP blocking the move, so
NYMEX's higher standard will remain in effect through February 1996.
   Several East Coast states have since ended their oxy-fuel programs,
leading NYMEX to adopt the lower oxygen requirement.  "It will allow
users of the contract to avoid delivery risks associated with changes
to the oxygenated fuels programs within the metropolitan area,"
Thompson said.

STAR ENTERPRISE & SUBWAY CO-DEVELOPMENT STARTS IN PA & NJ

   Star Enterprise and Subway have entered into an agreement in the
fast food company will lease space inside Star Enterprise owned and
operated Texaco-branded System 2000 stations in 26 East and Gulf Coast
states and Washington, D.C. The Subway franchisees will operate full-
menu restaurants on-site.
   Star also announced plans to open Taco Bell franchises in Florida
retail outlets this month.
   The first co-developed outlets to open under the agreement will be
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  A Subway linked to a Texaco branded
food mart will open in Allentown, PA in January.  "We expect to open
additional Subway co-developed locations in the eastern part of the
state in the first quarter," said Jay Wetherby, Star Enterprise
district manager.
   A Subway located in a Star Mart opened in November in Millville,
N.J., with another opening in Mt. Laurel, N.J. at the end of December. 
Two additional Texaco-branded Star Mart/Subway combinations will open
in Berlin, N.J. in the first quarter 1996.  While the Mt. Laurel
location seat for 20, other locations will only offer takeout food.
   "New Jersey is a full-service state which means that customers
don't have to get out of their cars to gas up or pay," said Joe
Jantorno, Star Enterprise district manager.  "We, of course, want them
to visit our Star Marts, so we had to find something to that would
motivate them to come inside, especially in the winter months when
everyone would prefer not to leave the warmth of their cars.  We hope
that our alliance with Subway will be a good incentive to get
customers inside."

ETHANOL ATTACKS CONCERN MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL

   Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III expressed concern
over radio spots sponsored by Minnesotans for a Fuel Alternative
(MFFA) that questioned the safety and reliability of ethanol use in
small engines.
   "What is in the best interest of the petroleum industry is not
always in the best interest of Minnesota," Humphrey said.  "What is in
Minnesota's best interest is the air we breathe; the water we drink,
swim and fish in; our economy; and the health of our children."
   "Amoco's continued attack on the year-round use of oxygenated fuels
is a shortsighted attempt to increase Amoco profits at the expense of
Minnesota's clean air," said Jerry Orr, Executive Director of the
American Lung Association of Hennepin County, MN.
   Although Minnesota does not require a specific oxygenate in its
2.7% oxygenate blend law, ethanol has become the oxygenate of choice
in Minnesota, according to a statement released by the Attorney
General's Office.  Amoco claims that because there are no testing or
blending tolerances in the Minnesota law, MTBE and ETBE cannot meet
the specification.

COUNCIL OF GREAT LAKES GOVERNORS FUNDS ETHANOL RESEARCH

   Three ethanol research projects were among the ventures receiving
grants from the Council of Great Lakes Governors, the group said.  The
Council, through its Regional Biomass Energy Program (RBEP), will be
providing grants to a total of seven research projects focusing on
developing the region's renewable resources.
   Ethanol research will receive more than 40% of the $323,800 given
by the group, according to Fred Kuzel, director of RBEP.  "Because of
the amount of ethanol produced in this region, the [grants] Steering
Committee has decided to make this research a priority," he said.  The
seven-state Great Lakes Region, which includes Illinois, Indiana and
Minnesota, produces about 800 million gallons of ethanol per year, or
about 57% of the total U.S. production.  Ethanol research projects
funded were:
   "The Application of Waste Sugar Alternative Feedstocks to Ethanol
Production" by Vienna Agricultural Research Center, Illinois
Department of Corrections.  This project, to receive $30,000 from
RBEP, aims to reduce the cost of ethanol production by supplementing
the primary feedstock (corn) with waste sugar from confectioners and
beverage manufacturers.
   "Improved Alcohol Production from Corn Fiber Employing SSF with
Thermal and Ethanol Tolerant Yeasts" by the Laboratory of Renewable
Resources Engineering at Purdue University.  This project, to receive
$60,000 from RBEP, will genetically engineer a strain of yeast culture
that can simultaneously ferment glucose and xylose sugars to ethanol. 
The project will also develop simultaneous sacrification and
fermentation (SSF) technology in a multiple-stage fermentor system for
recycling yeast cells to improve ethanol yield from corn fiber.  The
project is part of a larger on-going research sponsored by Amoco Corp.
and the Consortium of Plant Biotechnology Research. 
   "Bioblended Fuel for Use in Light-Duty Compression Ignition
Engines" by the Automotive Engineering Technology Program at Mankato
State University (MSU).  This project, granted $50,000 RBEP, will
examine the blending of biodiesel fuel with ethanol to form a bio-
blended fuel for use in light-duty, compression ignition engines.
   RBEP sends requests for proposals out in April.  For information
call Kuzel at (312) 407-0177.

TOTAL PETROLEUM PUTS ARKANSAS CITY REFINERY UP FOR SALE

   Total Petroleum Ltd. will close its 56,000 b/d Arkansas City, KS,
refinery if it cannot find a buyer for the facility.  The company just
recently put the refinery up for sale and contracted Smith Barney to
help unload it.  Some confidentiality agreements have already been
signed by interested parties, according to Total President and CEO
Gary Jones.
   The refinery has a low complexity and has been marginally
profitable for five years, Jones said.  "On a stand-alone basis it is
profitable," he said, explaining that the facility does not fit into
Total's strategy of moving "capital investments toward marketing and
logistics.  The balance in the Mid-continent is such that we are
currently long on product." 
   The gasoline and diesel fuel that is produced at the refinery is
sold on the spot market, Jones said.  The  company relies on its
68,000 b/d Ardmore, OK, refinery to supply all of its retail outlets
in Kansas and Missouri, he said.  Total has invested heavily in
upgrading that facility in recent years and no longer needs the
Arkansas City refinery to meet its needs.
   "It is a good refinery," Jones said.  "We haven't invested much in
it in the past few years, but it is in good shape environmentally," he
said, noting that a buyer would have to make some investments to meet
today's more stringent environmental standards.  "This refinery will
fit someone else's needs better than ours."  Should Total be forced to
close the facility, it would become the fifth Kansas refinery to shut
down in the last decade.

VALERO CRITICIZES FLAW IN TOXICS RELEASE INVENTORY AND STUDY

   Valero Energy Corp. wrote to the U.S. EPA protesting the way an
environmental group interpreted its Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)
data, contending the group made its Corpus Christi, TX refinery look
like a four times worse polluter than it really is.  The TRI lists the
toxics emissions levels on an annual basis of facilities that use,
manufacture or process, certain levels of toxic chemicals.  This
threshold includes all U.S. refineries, which must report on emissions
of 586 toxic chemicals.  
   Last month, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) released a report
that identified Valero as one of the most-polluting refineries, on the
basis of emissions in relation to crude input capacity.  However, as
Valero pointed out in a letter to Lynn Goldman, assistant
administrator, EPA Pesticides and Toxic Substances, Valero primarily
processes heavy resid oil, not crude.
   "When EDF reviewed Valero's refinery, it inaccurately assumed that
Valero's throughput consisted only of crude oil processing (29,000
b/d), when our actual processing throughput was 122,919 b/d (crude and
resid oil) for 1992," wrote William Greehey, Valero CEO.  "This
calculation inaccurately resulted in our emission per barrel of
throughput being reported as four times higher than it actually is." 
Valero should have been ranked 103 on EDF's list, not 27, wrote
Greehey.
   In addition, Valero pointed out that its TRI emissions total for
1992, the year in question, included emissions from its marine loading
facility, which were not required under TRI guidelines.  "Valero
recently installed a marine vapor recovery unit that eliminates
approximately three million pounds per year of volatile organic
compounds from Corpus Christi's air," Greehey added.
   Valero has installed the best available control technology at
Corpus Christi, wrote Greehey, noting that Texas recently presented
the company with its Environmental Excellence Award.  "We are proud of
our environmental record and we believe that EDF's use of TRI data has
unfairly damaged our reputation," wrote Greehey.  "When TRI data are
notably misused, would EPA be willing to assist in setting the record
straight?"

CALIFORNIA'S LATEST ESTIMATE SEES ADEQUATE RFG SUPPLY

   California refiners have the capacity to produce enough RFG meeting
Phase 2 specifications even if demand next year surges beyond 900,000
b/d, says the California Energy Commission (CEC) in its latest
"Supply/Demand Balance Update."
   CEC, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), refiners and other
interested parties have been studying RFG implementation through the
California RFG Advisory Committee.  After reviewing gasoline demand
data for the past several years, CEC has determined that the most
likely demand level next year will be 890,000 b/d.  Even with the
closure this summer of two small refineries, Powerine and Pacific,
maximum Phase 2 RFG production capacity for California refiners is
962,000 b/d, according to industry input provided to CEC, leaving a
margin of 72,000 b/d.  Even under its high-demand scenario of 917,000
b/d, "supplies of CaRFG for 1996 should be adequate."
   CARB has recommended that the mitigation fee be 15 c/gal, and
public comments made at a policy workshop generally supported that
level, said Allan Hirsh, CARB spokesman.  CARB staff will review the
written comments and prepare a final recommendation for the full CARB
Board, which will vote on the proposal at its Jan. 25 meeting.
   In January, CARB will finalize the circumstances under which a
refiner can request a waiver, but Hirsch said that these are only for
emergency situations beyond a refiner's control.  Some of the waivers
granted refiners under the clean-diesel program in 1993 were disputed
by competing refiners as too generous, both in terms of the diesel
volumes affected and the waiver fee.

GIANT SELLS E&P TO FOCUS ON REFINING AND MARKETING

   Giant Industries, Inc. is downsizing after its recent acquisition
of a Bloomfield, NM, refinery by selling off its oil exploration and
production business to focus on refining and marketing operations. 
Giant will upgrade and debottleneck the 16,000-b/d Bloomfield plant
and the 26,000-b/d Ciniza, NM, refinery, but has not settled on the
amount of capital to spend.  It will likely construct a new splitter
tower at Bloomfield as well.  The changes are expected to increase
capacity at both refineries.  
   The company is also looking to expand its company-owned and
operated retail system of some 57 outlets, primarily in southern Utah
and southern Colorado near the "Four Corners" area.  "Although there's
talk about bringing in jobberships or dealerships from time to time, I
think we'll continue to be a company-owned and operated retail and
convenience outlet system for now," said spokesman George Seitts. 
Giant recently installed pay-at-the-pump readers and redesigned some
of its outlets. 
   The exploration and production division reported losses for every
year since 1991, up until the most recent nine months ending Sept. 30,
when it reported pretax earnings of $217,000.  However, the division
must also deduct "substantial" ceiling test writedowns from that. 
Despite the beginnings of a turnaround -- oil production will be 35%
higher in 1995 than in 1993 -- E&P contribution has not met
expectations, the company reported.
   "We are under no pressure to 'fire sale' these assets," said Jim
Acridge, Giant's Chairman and CEO, "as the volume and quality of our
reserves has greatly improved over the last two years as a result of
the efficiencies and efforts of a new management team hired in early
1994."

CHEVRON REORGANIZATION COMBINES OFFICES & CUTS 130 JOBS 

   Chevron is restructuring its U.S. gasoline marketing business,
combining regional offices, consolidating support functions and re-
focusing the organization on sales and growth.  The restructuring is
scheduled to be finished by summer 1996.
   The reorganization will eliminate about 130 positions, create some
new jobs and relocate others.  Chevron's non-service station workforce
will be downsized 5% to 1,900.
   The Houston and Atlanta offices responsible for the former Central
and Southern gasoline marketing "regions" will combine to form a new
Eastern Sales Center based in Atlanta.  The San Ramon, CA, and La
Habra, CA, offices handling the former Northwest and Southwest
"regions" will form a Western Sales Center based in La Habra. 
Headquarters and specialized support for gasoline marketing will
remain based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
   Operations, business services and station development functions
once managed regionally will be managed on a national basis. 
Specialized groups at the Bay Area headquarters will emphasize Chevron
brand strategy and development, convenience store marketing and jobber
relations.  The Hawaii retail gasoline marketing structure will
continue as a combined sales and distribution unit.

INDUSTRY DEBATES EFFECTIVENESS OF OXYGENATES IN RFG

   Some refiners claim that the use of oxygen in gasoline only reduces
in CO emissions when new vehicle technology is used.  Fuel oxygenates
proponents claim that an oxygenate addition to RFG provides air
quality and toxics improvement that is superior to low-Rvp
alternatives.  An Auto/Oil study has added fuel to the fire on both
sides of that debate.
   Tests performed on the emissions benefits of California Phase 2 RFG
and a gasoline blended to the same specifications, but without an
oxygenate component, showed that differences between the two gasolines
were generally not statistically significant.  Oxygenate proponents
argue that the study's data only shows that there is little benefit to
oxygen in gasoline and fails to take into consideration the benefits
of oxygenates.
   Auto/Oil technical bulletin #17 suggests that the use of oxygen in
RFG provides little, if any, emissions benefit, outside of reductions
in CO.  In fact, the only significant difference between oxygenated
and non-oxygenated RFG noted was 13% higher formaldehyde emissions in
oxygenated RFG when used in an advanced technology fleet.
   Auto/Oil performed the study to determine whether the oxygenate
required in California Phase 2 gasoline would affect emissions in
later technology vehicles to the extent predicted in earlier work. 
Four fleets, ranging from older vehicles (model year 1983 to 1985) to
an advanced technology fleet of prototype passenger cars, were tested.
   "What [the Auto/Oil Study] tells us is that as the fleet continues
to turn-over, the benefit of mandatory oxygen will continue to
decline," said Mike Ingham, manager of the transportation fuels
performance unit of Chevron Research Corp.  "There continues to be
some benefit to the use of oxygenates in older vehicles.  What we were
trying to do was run a clean test of the benefits of oxygenates."    
   "As for the issue of dilution, what the oxygenate industry wants to
do is take credit for the benefits of splash blending and attribute
them to oxygenates," said Ingham.  "With new technology, that benefit
is not there.  If we need those types of benefits, a refinery can
tweak the blend to hit the desired target.  It is not appropriate to
claim those as benefits of oxygenates."
   Proponents of oxygenates have a different interpretation of the
study, arguing that while the study does show that the addition of
oxygen in RFG provides few emissions benefits over RFG, it helps make
the case that oxygenates added to gasoline provide substantial
emissions improvements.
   "What is important to consider here is the difference between
'oxygen' and 'oxygenates'," said Fred Potter, president of Information
Resources Inc.  "When you add oxygenates to RFG, it dilutes the
sulfur, olefins and aromatics in the blend with a cleaner-burning
hydrocarbon that gets more of its energy from burning hydrogen and
less from carbon.
   "During the Auto/Oil study, these components were often back-
blended into the gasoline, thus eliminating the emissions gains that
are normally made by oxygenate addition," said Potter.  "After
blending these high-emission components back into the fuel, the only
thing left in the oxygenated RFG was the oxygen itself, which, outside
of carbon dioxide advantages, yielded little emissions improvement
over the  non-oxygenated RFG when new vehicle technology was used.  It
is also important to point out that the Auto/Oil Study did not give
any credit to oxygenates for their octane improvements, which allows
for fewer aromatics and olefins in the final fuel.  It also provides
no stationary source credits when less octane production is required
at the refinery."
   "When I looked at the study, I noticed that the properties of the
two gasolines are the same except for the oxygenates," said Cal Hodge,
manager of marketing and regulatory analysis, Valero Energy Corp. 
While the technical bulletin did not say what the octane numbers were
for the two gasolines, it is likely that the non-oxygenated gasoline
lost at least two octane numbers, he said, noting that this will cause
problems for cars that are sensitive to octane.
   Ingham noted that the octane level of the oxygenated RFG was
slightly higher, but that both had adequate octane numbers over 90
(R+M)/2.

CALIFORNIA CHIPS AWAY AT ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE

   California held a public hearing to accept comments on amending the
Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate and unveiled three alternative
emission reduction concepts. 
   The new plan under formulation may be more palatable to automakers
who balked at the 2% ZEV mandate, which would have required them to
offer for sale 20,000 electric cars in 1998 and another 10% in 2000. 
The new plan, expected in mid-to-late-January for a March
presentation, drops the 2% mandate for the first four years of the
program.  Carmakers estimate that the revised plan will still result
in 14,000 electric cars being offered in 1998.
   Modifications are drawing attention in the East because
northeastern states adopted a plan that mirrors California's,
including the ZEV option.  Changes to California's plan may require
changes in those states which have adopted the controversial ZEV
mandates, which at this time can only be met with short-range,
expensive electric vehicles.  
   If the ZEV program was to begin in 1998, as originally mandated,
the vehicles would displace 14 tons per day of pollution by 2010.  The
challenge lies in finding equivalent reductions when "the cherry tree
of options has already been picked," one source said.
    Reformulated gasoline, enhanced inspection and maintenance,
vehicle scrappage and the LEV program (including ZEVs) have all been
counted as part of the on-road mobile source state implementation plan
in California.  Yet even if the ZEV program is fully implemented,
California would fall short of meeting its Clean Air Act requirements. 
   While the program  will "encourage" ZEVs with demonstrations and
credits, the board will not require them.  Secondly, a combination of
market forces and regulatory requirements will include a "market-based
ZEV launch" with incentives and a suspension of the mandate through
2003.  It would also add introduction of 2,000 advanced batteries and
long-range vehicles in 1998 through 2000, with credits for the sale of
additional vehicles.  By 2004, CARB would require automakers to offer
for sale 10% ZEVs.  The last concept would maintain the mandate, but
with slower phase-ins, starting with 1%, and moving to 2%, then 5%,
then 10%.

ILLINOIS PREPARES TO BEGIN VEHICLE INCENTIVE PROGRAM

   Gov. Jim Edgar (R-IL) has signed into law a measure to promote the
use of alternative fueled vehicles.  The bill, known as the Alternate
Fuels Act, becomes effective within 90 days.
   The Act will establish a rebate program which allows fleet owners
and operators to apply for one of three types of rebates, which
include: a conversion cost rebate;  an original equipment manufacturer
differential cost rebate; and a fuel cost differential rebate -- based
on a three-year life cycle cost.  The rebate shall not exceed $4,000
per vehicle, over the life of the rebate program.
   The Act authorizes the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to
establish an ethanol research program to cut production costs or
increase the viability of ethanol fuels by developing new engine
technologies and ethanol refueling facilities.
   The Act will be funded by establishing a user fee of $20 per
vehicle required of public fleets with 10 or more vehicles.  All
state, county, and local government vehicles (rental, antique and
electric) along with motorcycles are exempt from the fee.
   In FY96, up to $200,000 may be appropriated from the fund to pay
for administrating the program.   The ethanol research fund will
receive 20% of the remaining funds, and 80% will be appropriated to
the rebate programs.  The program will be in effect until Dec. 31,
1999, or until funds are no longer available.

NEVADA CERTIFIES WATER-BLEND AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL

   A-21, a fuel comprised of 55% water and 45% naphtha and bonded
together by a proprietary surfactant,  can now be used to meet
Nevada's definition of an alternative fuel.  
   "This fuel can be dispensed in existing fuel infrastructure, has a
very low fire hazard potential, can be used in both compression-
ignited engines and spark-ignited engines and has emission levels
significantly below California Air Resources Board (CARB) tier 1
reformulated gasoline emission standards," according to a Nevada
Division of Environmental Protection recommendation that A-21 be
included in the state's clean fuel program.
   State agency fleets of 10 or more are required to incorporate
alternative fuel vehicles starting with the 1995 fiscal year. 
Nevada's definition of alternative fuel follows CARB standards and
includes ethanol, methanol, RFG, natural gas, propane and hydrogen.  
   The request to include A-21 was originally made by the A55 Limited
Partnership.  The Reno-based company has joined engine manufacturer
Caterpillar Inc. in a venture company called Advanced Fuels to
commercialize A-21.   
   A Nevada Division of Environmental Protection demonstration of the
fuel in a 1991 Taurus showed emissions results that surpass Ford
standards for 2002 and beyond.  The Taurus and a Reno city bus also
demonstrated increased fuel efficiency, eliminating the range issue
other alternative fuels are trying to overcome.  
   A-21 is being demonstrated in a stationary generator owned by
Sierra Pacific Power Co., and Nevada is exploring mining applications. 
Other states have expressed interest in A-21 as a cost-effective way
to reduce emissions.
   An expert questioned the viability of using naphtha.  "The direct
use of naphtha in a fuel will undermine its conversion value in a
typical U.S. refinery," said Herb Bruch, president of B&B Associates
and member of the 21st Century Fuels Advisory Board.

NEW JERSEY FIRST TO EMBRACE NLEV, BUT RETAINS CONTINGENCY  

   New Jersey blazed the trail for northeast states this week,
becoming the first to sign a rule requiring it to participate in the
tenuously pending national low emission vehicle (NLEV) program, if
that plan is passed.  As a contingency, the state ruled for opting-in
to the Ozone Transport Commission's program (OTC-LEV) if the
nationwide plan falls through.
   The state's Department of Environmental Protection said it prefers
NLEV because it provides emission controls more stringent than present
model cars, but at less expense than the technology used in
California.  Also, cleaner cars would be sold nationally, rather than
just in the 12  northeast states plus the District of Columbia, the
department said.  Other states, such as Rhode Island and
Massachusetts, are considering also adopting NLEV, which would begin
with 1997 model-year cars (OTC-LEV starts with the 1999 model year).  
   "Because a substantial amount of air pollution travels across state
lines into New Jersey," said Bob Shinn, New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection.  "It's important to adopt measures that will
have broad impact on air quality, which will help us meet our Clean
Air Act requirements, and will keep New Jersey economically
competitive with the rest of the country," he said.
   U.S. EPA has set a NLEV resolution deadline of  Feb. 15, by which
time automakers and the Northeast states must either voluntarily adopt
it, or states will likely begin implementing the "backstop" OTC-LEV
plan adopted earlier this year to achieve air quality control.   The
optional zero emission vehicle mandate, adopted by New York,
Massachusetts and Vermont, remains the chief sticking point in the
discussions between the two groups.  Neither of New Jersey's plans
includes a provision for the sale of zero emission vehicles. 
   "Each state may adopt whatever measure it wants as long as it meets
the equivalent air quality reductions," explained Dave West, chief of
New Jersey Bureau of Transportation Control.  "Each does not
necessarily need to adopt OTC-LEV; it may come up with its own plan. 
However, that would be very difficult because the reductions are
considerable from the OTC-LEV program."
   Each state must still form its alternative in a revised state
implementation plan by Feb. 15, and enforce it program with state
regulations.  Although each state will have its own plan, pollution
mitigation is regional because air quality is affected by pollution
crossing state lines, West added.

API PETITIONS EPA FOR PHASE II NOX REPEAL

   In the first attempt to unravel Phase II RFG, the American
Petroleum Institute (API) filed in early December a petition with U.S.
EPA, seeking repeal of EPA's requirements to reduce summertime
nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions.
   EPA estimates NOX reduction costs to range $5,000/ton, while API's
estimate exceeds $10,000/ton.  API "remains convinced that EPA's
estimates of gasoline desulfurization costs and the cost-effectiveness
of NOX reductions are far too low because of flawed refinery modeling
assumptions."
   API claims that consumers would face higher costs because refiners
would have to make significant capital investments to comply with the
NOX rule.  
   "EPA's RFG NOX reduction requirements reflect an overstatement of
air quality benefits, are not a cost-effective strategy for ozone
control, and are inconsistent with the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 and the 1991 RFG regulatory negotiations," API said.

FIRST CAAA 1990 CHANGE PASSES HOUSE AND SENATE 

   The first modification to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 --
making Employee Commute Options (ECO) reductions optional -- passed
the House and Senate last month.
   H.R. 325 was sponsored by Rep. Don Manzullo (R-IL) in the House and
Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), in the Senate.  
   Under current law, states with severe or extreme ozone
nonattainment areas are mandated to use trip reduction as part of
State Implementation Plans.  Manzullo's office noted that "it has been
found and the EPA has agreed that even if the ECO mandate was
implemented to the letter of the law, at best, it would have only a
`minuscule' impact on clean air.  In the end, the cost of the ECO
provision would far exceed any benefit as the law is currently
written."
   Also known as the employee trip reduction plan, the rule requires
companies with 100 employees or more in the highest nonattainment
areas to reduce commuter car trips 25%.  Though previously mandatory,
the change would make the rule optional and leave enforcement up to
the states.
   "The bill gives states the option to use car pooling or other trip
reduction programs in their plan to attain clean air standards,"
Manzullo said.

EPA POSTPONES NOZZLE FLOW RATE DEADLINE FOR SIX MONTHS

   The Environmental Protection Agency has extended by six months the
deadline to comply with its new gasoline pumping rate restriction (see
story.  
   The previous deadline was Jan. 1, 1996, but a notice from the
director of EPA's Office of Mobil Sources said the agency is extending
it to July 1, 1996.  The change needs approval by the Office of
Management and Budget.
   The extension will give retailers more time to comply with the new
regulation, which limits the rate at which gasoline is dispensed from
the pump to 10 gallons per minute (GPM).  Some dispense gasoline at
rates up to 13 GPM. 
   Several trade associations had requested the extension because EPA
had not set testing specifications with guidelines on how to comply. 
In addition, the groups said, devices to limit pumps to the new flow
rate were not available.  
   "We  think it would have been chaotic if EPA had stayed with the
January deadline," said Petroleum Marketers Association of America
Vice President of Communications David Morehead.
   The EPA rule contradicted a California Air Resources Board
certification of Stage II vapor recovery devices for service station
pumps with dispensing rates of 12 and 13 gallons per minute, according
to API.

ETHANOL WATCH

   Gulf Coast rack ethanol traded last month at $1.17/gal for domestic
sale, ranging $1.18-1.22/gal for export.  Some ethanol activity
(especially for January delivery) continued in late December.  While
ethanol prices reflected mid-to-late-December wrap-up deals, many
players were already turning their focus to January/February business. 
   Gulf Coast export traffic was slow, which was partially an effect
of high U.S. ethanol prices but also a result of lagging Brazilian
demand.
   Though near-term ethanol prices were expected to remain firm, some
excess product was expected to be available for January/February
deals.
   The West Coast reportedly had a two-tiered market, with contract
barrels at $1.24/gal and spot ethanol deliveries at $1.28/gal. 
Explaining the recent price surge, a source said oxy-fuel blenders
under-contracted their winter requirements, expecting "a loose spot
market" this season, but supplies have been tight for several weeks. 
Also, railroad consolidations in 1995 brought service reductions, so
it often takes twice as long to deliver ethanol from the Midwest.
   Supply tightness persisted in the Midwest.  Chicago prices ranged
$1.18-1.22/gal, a supplier said, while an independent refiner/marketer
placed other markets in the $1.19-1.22/gal range.  Some users cut back
the amount of ethanol blended into gasoline from 10 vol% to 5.7 vol%
per gallon.  The current supply tightness will probably be alleviated
once oxy-fuels demand begins to slow down in mid-February, the
supplier said.  
   An accident at Archer Daniels Midland's (ADM) largest ethanol plant
in Decatur, IL, last month will not impact the company's ethanol
production, the company said.  One of the boilers at a cogeneration
facility ruptured, said company spokesperson Carla Miller.  The
rupture occured in an area which had been shut down for maintenance.
The accident followed reports over previous weeks that ADM was having
production problems at at least one of its plants.  ADM also withdrew
from the spot market and put customers on allocation.

MTBE WATCH

   Gulf Coast spot MTBE finished December at 92 c/gal on continued
supply concerns.  The spread between East Coast and Gulf Coast MTBE
prices widened slightly from the usual 2.5-3.0 c/gal range to a strong
4-6 c/gal.  
   Octane values for East Coast MTBE were reportedly as high as
$1.10/gal, particularly for premium RFG and RFG for use in oxy-fuel
areas, as a result of continued tight supplies.
   Gulf Coast spot MTBE prices were also considered "fairly strong."  
However, the market was said to have quieted considerably by the end
of the month, and a trader noted that prices for later- month MTBE
delivery were considerably lower.
   Thanks to the latest rise in MTBE spot prices and lower feedstock
costs, producers are again seeing production margins climb to
respectable levels. 
    "Overall, 1995 was a fairly good year for MTBE producers, as far
as margins are concerned," said Jim Thomas, vice president of market
analysis for Houston-based Bonner and Moore Associates.  "After the
methanol price corrected itself at the end of the first quarter, MTBE
margins were fairly strong throughout the rest of the year."
   Margins did feel a pinch in late-October and early-November, but
the summer gasoline season supported the product fairly well, said
Thomas. 
   Incremental MTBE margins rose to a yearly high of 32 c/gal in May-
June, a dramatic improvement over 1994, when the unusually high
methanol price pushed several MTBE producers to cut back or shut down
some production capacity.  The yearly high margin for 1994 was only
about 13 c/gal, which was seen in late-December.
   Producers still using the A-B-C contracts are seeing stronger
margins.  While some A-B-C contracts still exist, they are "rapidly
disappearing," Thomas said.  "The new contracts will be structured for
each individual producer and buyer."  
   Those contracts are expected to be related more closely to MTBE's
gasoline blend value, with a premium or penalty based on the current
market price.  "The new contracts will be closely related to the
market, and the band around that price will be fairly narrow," Thomas
said.
   "MTBE margins are going to begin to stabilize soon.  We predict
that they are pretty much at their peak right now."
   The current strength in MTBE spot prices is due in part to the
closure of Enron's 12,500-b/d MTBE unit in Houston, said Thomas.  
   "The market is sensing a short-term shortage," he said.  "The
underlying fundamentals are not strong enough to support the latest
price increase."
   The major variable in MTBE profitability is methanol, which has
remained weak since early 1995.  The other major input, butane, has
remained steady throughout the year.
   Gulf Coast spot methanol traded in a steady 31-32 c/gal range with
most deals completed at 32 c/gal.  However, trade was very light. 
While a few chemicals-related deals may be completed during the last
week of the year, most players expect to be out of the market until
early January.
   Spot methanol prices were kept in check by the current supply glut,
and contract postings were expected to roll over from December to
January for most methanol producers.  At the end of December, only two
methanol producers have kept their list prices at 39 c/gal, with the
rest at 42 c/gal.  Meanwhile, transaction prices ranged in the mid-
30s, with most deals around 35-36 c/gal.
   Saturn Methanol Corp. plans to have its first methanol plant,
located in Point Lisas, Trinidad & Tobago, on-line by late 1997. 
Construction on the 2,500-metric-tons-per-day (287-million-gallons-
per-year) facility will begin in May 1996.  The capital cost for the
plant has been estimated at $250 million, said Deo van Wijk, president
of Saturn.  Lurgi Corp. will supply technology for the project.
   Financing and product off-take agreements for the plant have been
secured, van Wijk confirmed.  "In order to receive the financing, at
least 80% of your production must be spoken for," he said.  Saturn
will sell all methanol produced at the facility.
   While Saturn is a new company, formed in June 1994, its staff is
definitely not new to the methanol business, noted van Wijk.  "The
people we already have onboard and those we will add when construction
begins on the plant, have more than 200 years of combined experience
in the methanol industry.  For many of us, this will be the seventh
methanol plant we have built together.  This gives the company a
unique advantage," he said.
   Trinidad & Tobago "not only offers competitive natural gas prices,
but also skilled labor, logistical advantages and duty-free access to
both Europe and U.S. markets and has the needed infrastructure
available," said van Wijk.

HOUSE RECONSIDERS TAX INCENTIVE 

   ETBE's future is in limbo as members of the House of
Representatives reexamine ethanol's 54 c/gal excise tax exemption. 
Members for and against the incentive are circulating "Dear Colleague"
letters outlining their positions.  The main issue is the financial
impact of ethanol and ETBE's excise tax exemption. The House passed a
previous budget reconciliation bill without cutting the incentive.
   The first letter was from Rep. Randy Tate (R-WA), who calls ethanol
"an example of a good intention gone bad" and proposes to phase-out
the ethanol tax incentive.  "According to the Treasury Department,
ethanol has cost the Highway Trust Fund over $5.3 billion from 1983-
1994, $684 million in Fiscal Year 1994 alone.  Motorists pay gas taxes
and other user fees into the Highway Trust Fund. [Ethanol's] subsidy
comes right out of the Highway Trust Fund," Tate wrote.  A later draft
was signed by Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-FL), the ranking minority member on
the House Ways and Means Committee.
   Tate will introduce a bill this month to "eliminate the motor fuels
excise tax exemption for ethanol and scale back the excise tax credit
for ethanol."  The bill echoes Rep. Philip English (R-PA)'s bill, HR
264, which would end the incentive. 
   "The legislation to be introduced by Rep. Tate, if enacted, will
have the sure and swift effect of inflicting mortal damage" to the
industry, wrote Rep. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and others in response. 
   Another letter urges extending the incentive to 2002 to conform
with farm program cuts and other parts of a seven-year budget plan. 
Rep. Richard Durbin (D-IL) and 15 co-signers wrote, "The General
Accounting Office estimates that the value [of the incentive] to the
U.S. Treasury is as much as $6.3 billion over five years.  The direct
cost of the incentive is more than offset by additional income tax
revenues and reduced federal farm program costs."

GASOLINE/DIESEL WATCH

   Gulf Coast spot regular and premium traded at 46.95 c/gal and 49.65
c/gal, respectively.
   East Coast octane spreads catapulted to 13.50 c/gal mid-month
before ending the month at a still high 9.75 c/gal.  In addition to
higher MTBE prices and tight winter oxygenated (2.7wt% oxygen) RFG
supplies, several local refinery outages were sending gasoline prices
higher.
   Gulf Coast octane spreads widened briefly before returning to 2.7
c/gal, the low side of the typical 2.5-5.0 c/gal range.  Compounding a
glutted products market, Gulf Coast players sold off extra products in
storage ahead of yearly inventory taxes.
   In East Coast refinery news, Sun Co. shut down the 25,000 b/d
catalytic reformer at its 175,000 b/d Marcus Hook, PA, refinery.  At
the same time, BP was reportedly planning to cut production at its
172,000 b/d Marcus Hook refinery to 150,000 b/d before Tosco takes
possession.  At presstime, the company was still in negotiations with
labor leaders over the plan, which would lay off 130 workers.
   Some time in January/February, Chevron will restart its Richmond,
CA, refinery, the whole of which was closed in early December for six
weeks for major scheduled maintenance in anticipation of California
Phase 2 RFG.  Chevron said it had adequate supplies to cover the
shutdown period.  
   Retail gasoline prices made another decline from November to
December.  Self-serve regular gasoline fell 0.5 c/gal to $1.118/gal,
down 3.1 c/gal from December 1994 rates, according to the American
Automobile Association (AAA)'s Fuel Gauge Report.  "The good news
continues for holiday motorists as gasoline prices dropped for the
sixth consecutive month,"  AAA said.   The average price has dropped
11 c/gal since June.
   The average price of self-serve midgrade slipped 0.7 c/gal to
$1.211/gal while self-serve premium declined 0.4 c/gal to $1.295/gal. 
Prices were most expensive in the West, unchanged at $1.254/gal, and
least expensive in the Southeast, where prices fell 0.6 c/gal from
November rates to $1.032/gal.
   In distillates, Gulf Coast low-sulfur and high-sulfur diesel fuel
traded at 54.60 c/gal and 53.35 c/gal.  The cold wave across the
Northeast and Midwest propelled NYMEX No. 2 December heating oil
futures prices to two-year highs at around 58 c/gal.  Prices went
higher when January became the front-month, topping 60 c/gal, but
sources warned that the heating oil contract is overdue for a downward
correction.
   U.S. retail low-sulfur diesel fuel prices hit their highest average
since May 30, $1.12/gal, according to EIA's Distillate Watch for the
week ended Dec. 18.  Regional averages ranged: East, $1.12/gal;
Midwest, $1.11/gal; Gulf Coast, $1.09/gal; Rockies, $1.21/gal; and
West Coast, $1.26/gal.

SUPPLY/DEMAND WATCH

   Refinery production of gasoline took the opposite direction of
deliveries in November, according to the American Petroleum
Institute(API)'s November statistical report. 
   "Gasoline output declined for the first time this year, while
distillate production rose 2.5%, its strongest showing so far in
1995," API noted.
   Refinery gasoline output fell 1.1% from high November 1994 rates. 
"This was mostly due to unusually strong levels last November as the
reformulated gasoline program was gearing up for retail production
Jan. 1.  Even so, gasoline output has slackened off more than
seasonally in the past two months," API qualified.
   However, continued strong gasoline deliveries outpaced apparent
demand.  "November's 5.1% increase is especially surprising, and
unsupported by other indicators of underlying consumption.  Though
there have been some recent indications of further strengthening
demand, any such strengthening has likely been modest," API explained.
   As a result of declining refinery production of gasoline and
continued stronger-than-seasonal gasoline deliveries, total gasoline
stocks finished below 200 million bbl for the fourth month in a row.
   Influencing demand, the latest (September) on-highway and
interstate travel figures have both shown strong growth.  Meanwhile,
the repeal of Federal highway speed limits is expected to have a
"noticeable but small" impact on gasoline consumption, API said.  
   Many states, including California, Texas and others west of the
Mississippi River, plan to raise speed limits, according to API.
   A cold snap in the Northeast combined with growth in on-highway
trucking to push distillate deliveries 5.0% above November 1994 rates
to 3.34 million bbl last month -- the highest November rate since
1978.  November marked the third straight month of growth above 4%.
   "In addition to increased demand for heating oil, demand for diesel
fuel for on-highway vehicles is also estimated to have added 30,000-
40,000 b/d to final demand for November distillates over last
November," API said.  "A slowing economy has reined in growth of on-
highway diesel demand from about 135,000 b/d in the first quarter. 
November's growth in on-highway diesel is estimated to be the lowest
for the year to date."
   Low-sulfur diesel deliveries continued to surpass high-sulfur
deliveries.  Low-sulfur deliveries rose 150,000 b/d to 3.340 million
bbl.  High-sulfur deliveries totaled 2.049 million bbl -- inching up
10,000 b/d.  
   "Demand for heating oil was estimated to have grown by more than 10
times this amount.  This suggests that the pattern of spill-over of
low-sulfur distillate to uses where it is not required continued in
November, and up to 120,000 b/d of the increased heating demand may
have been met by deliveries of low-sulfur oil," API said.
   Distillate stocks rose 4 million bbl to 135 million bbl, "the low
end of the typical range for November," API said.
   Total imports of crude oil and petroleum products, which had
declined in seven of the previous 10 months, made a strong year-to-
year increase.  Total imports averaged 9.429 million b/d -- 8.3%
higher than November 1994 rates.
   U.S. crude oil production fell again.  The 6.495 million b/d level
trailed November 1994 by 2%.

STATE CLEAN AIR PROGRESS RANKED

   Across the U.S., five states have made no progress towards meeting
Clean Air Act deadlines -- and only three have made steady progress,
reveals Clean Air at the Crossroads: Progress Made and Challenges
Ahead, a new report released by the Clean Air Network.  
   Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Texas and Virginia were given a "red"
designation, indicating "no progress, will not make deadlines."  Only
New Mexico, North Carolina and Oregon received a "green" designation:
"steadily making progress; on track to meet public health standards by
the deadlines in the Clean Air Act."  
   Most states received a "yellow" or "orange" grade.  While "yellow"
signified "making progress in some areas, no progress in others; could
get back on right track and meet the deadlines," "orange" symbolized
"making progress in a few areas, no progress in others; enough off
track that it will not make deadlines." 
   The group did not rank for 10 states: Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa,
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, West
Virginia and Wyoming.
GEORGIA:  Private and local government fleet managers in Atlanta are
showing increased interest in alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs),
according to a survey  by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
In 1994, AFVs made up 1% of Atlanta's fleets of six or more vehicles. 
Most were in local government fleets, but 3% of private fleet managers 
reported AFV plans for 1995, EIA said.  
   Fueling availability plays a major role.  Since 85% of local
government fleets fuel at central government-owned sites, alternative
fuels could be easier to incorporate.  Only 10% of the privately owned
fleets had central fueling sites.
ILLINOIS:  Gov. Jim Edgar (R-IL) signed the Alternate Fuels Act, which
will be in effect until Dec. 31, 1999, or until funds are no longer
available.  The Act established a rebate program for fleet owners and
operators, which will not exceed $4,000 per vehicle.
   The Act authorizes the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to
establish an ethanol fuel research program to cut ethanol production
costs or raise the viability of ethanol fuels by developing new engine
technologies and refueling facilities.  The Act will be funded through
a user fee of $20 per vehicle on fleets with 10 or more vehicles.  In
FY96, up to $200,000 may be appropriated from the fund to pay
administrative costs.  The ethanol research fund will receive 20% of
the remaining funds, and the other 80% will cover the rebate programs. 
KENTUCKY:  EPA Director of Mobile Sources Margo Oge has written the
director of the Kentucky Division of Air Quality, John Hornback,
asking him to consider ending the state's request to leave the federal
RFG program.   EPA is hoping the opt-out request is pulled before it
is forced to make a decision on whether it will allow three counties
in Northern Kentucky to opt-out of RFG.  
   The letter suggests that Hornback should review ozone exceedences
during 1995.  Preliminary ozone monitoring data last summer "reveal a
continuing ozone problem," indicating that there was at least one
ozone violation.  Gov. Brereton Jones (D) originally requested the
opt-outs.  Since then, Kentucky elected a new governor, Paul Patton
(D), and it is unclear whether he will pursue the opt-out.
NEBRASKA:  A coalition of Nebraska ethanol interests is pushing for
all gasoline sold statewide to contain a minimum oxygenate level
starting in 1997, and it hopes to introduce a bill in the state's
legislature by the second week of January.  
   The current "reformulated fuel" definition requires a 3.1 wt%
oxygen, with no other parameters, but the fuel is not required at any
time of year.  Ethanol interests want to amend the law to reduce the
oxygen level but apply it statewide starting January 1997.  Whether to
implement a 2.7 wt% or 2.0 wt% minimum oxygenate standard is still
being debated.  Nebraska uses about 930 million gallons per year of
gasoline; 30% contains ethanol.
