<b> NEW INDUSTRY- RUN HEALTH ECONOMICS DATABASE<br>
LAUNCHED BY OHE AND IFPMA </b>
</center>
<p>
A specialised data service using CD-ROM to help identify economic evaluations in health care has been launched by the Office of Health Economics (OHE) and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).
<p>
The service, known as HEED (a Health Economic Evaluations Database), is a database that contains information on health economics articles, in particular studies of cost-effectiveness (and other forms of economic evaluation), with objective analysis of key articles.
<p>
HEED now has more than 6,000 bibliographic references and 2,200 reviewed articles, building up through monthly updates to contain a comprehensive bibliography of all published economic literature.

<a name=content><b>Content</b></a><br>
A monthly search of clinical and economic on-line databases is undertaken, combined with hand searching of the leading journals containing evaluation literature. Working papers from academic institutions and references from reviewed and other papers are also included.
<p>Reviews are undertaken of the selected key literature by researchers in academic institutions according to a structured format. In addition to providing an overview of the paper, they also provide additional information, such as ICD-9 and ATC Codes, type of economic evaluation, and type of data source for events and resources used. These categories can be searched on using the CD-ROM software.
<p>
<a name=database><b>Searching the Database</b></a><br>
HEED is very easy to use, even for beginners. There are no complex commands to learn and nearly all operations are simply 'point and click'. You will find that HEED has been designed for easy reference and frequent use. 
<p>With 54 fields to choose from, you can search the database by tailoring your search criteria to pick up only data of relevance to you. The search criteria are grouped into a number of subject groupings. Each subject grouping contains specific search criteria, which you can specify in any combination (in addition to wild card and Boolean functions) to search the database. You can modify and refine your search criteria to quickly access your search results in manageable quantities.  The subject groupings include:
<ul>
<li>Bibliographical details
<li>Study definitions
<li>Analysis and results
<li>Keywords
</ul>
<p>You will be able to search HEED using keywords or any combination of the search criteria that includes:              
<ul>
<li>Author name 
<li>Book/Journal name
<li>Countries applicable
<li>Publication dates 
<li>Publication status
<li>Study dates
<li>ATC classifications 
<li>Data Sources 
<li>Drug names
<li>ICD-9 classifications
<li>Non-drug technologies
<li>Technology assessed
<li>Type of article
<li>Type of economic evaluation
<li>Costs included
<li>Discounting
<li>Patient groups
<li>Sensitivity analysis
<li>Sources of clinical and economic information
<li>Sponsor
</ul>
<p>
You will be able to save your search criteria for use at a later date. 
<p>
<a name=freports><b>Formatted Reports </b></a><br>
The HEED CD-ROM reports will present the results of your search in a clear easy-to-read format.
<p>There are four default report formats:
<ul>
<li>Search Report
<li>Summary Report
<li>Brief Report
<li>Detailed Report
</ul>
<p>
The reports will present the results of your search at increasing levels of detail. The Detailed Report will additionally provide details of the study question, key results and, providing Copyright permission has been given by the article publisher, the article abstract in full.
<p>
Hypertext links are available so that you can access the ICD-9 and ATC sub-reports. You can  also design report  formats for your own specific requirements.
<p>
The results of your search can be directed to a printer at varying levels of detail. You can also export your search results to floppy disc in report or ASCII formats.
<p>
<a name=acpan><b> Academic Panel</a></b><br>
A panel of academic advisors is providing guidance on the search  and review processes.  The panel comprises Martin Buxton, Mike Drummond, Bernie O'Brien, Kevin Schulman, Bengt Jonsson, Frans Rutten, Joan Rovira and Akinori Hisashige.
<p>
<a name=org><b>Organisation</b></a><br>
HEED has been set up with finance from more than 20 companies in the USA, Europe and Japan, who comprise the Steering Group for the project. New industry subscribers will be included in a user group designed to ensure the service develops in accordance with industry needs.
