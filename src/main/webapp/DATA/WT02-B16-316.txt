<B>Safety Analysis of High-Pressure Gaseous Fuel Container 
Punctures;<br>

Michael Swain, Principal Investigator,<br>

<P>

This is a full-scale study to assess the risk of storing hydrogen, as 
opposed to 

natural gas, in compressed form.  Risks include both the likelihood and 
the severity of 

combustion.  Previous work comparing hydrogen and natural gas pipeline 
leakage showed that 

hydrogen clouds were smaller and contained less energy than natural gas 
clouds.  The current 

study simulates tank ruptures.  The size of the leaked cloud of hydrogen 
or natural gas is 

quantified by testing ignitability at the edge of the cloud.  In 
addition, we measure the 

overpressure produced by igniting the cloud, because this is an 
indication of the severity of 

combustion.  We use high-speed photography to document the combustion.

<P>

Leaking high-pressure hydrogen produced a cone-shaped cloud of ignitable 
gases with 

28  included angle, whereas leaking high-pressure methane produced a 
cone of ignitable gases 

with 20 included angle.  Ignition of hydrogen also produced greater 
overpressure than did 

ignition of the natural gas cloud.  The largest hydrogen overpressures 
were comparable to those 

produced by inflating an 11-inch child's balloon until it bursts.

<P>

Our results have several implications for improving the design of 
hydrogen storage 

systems in vehicles.  Venting upward enables the naturally buoyant 
hydrogen gas to be carried 

away from the vehicle in the event of an accident.  This reduces the 
likelihood that gases will be 

trapped in the vehicle and that they will come into contact with 
ignition sources.  In addition, 

storing compressed gas in many small containers rather than a few large 
containers can reduce 

the amount of gas released if a container is ruptured.

We modeled the vehicle performance of our hydrogen-fueled Toyota Tercel 


with compressed gas storage at 300 psi, using experimental data.  This 
table 

allows a comparison of our data with performance data on the original 
gasoline-

powered vehicle:

In April, we reviewed the notes from the cataloguing of standards,

 regulations, and codes.  Four areas of concern were delineated

and prepared for presentation at the Annual Hydrogen Program Review

Meeting.  Also, full-scale testing was conducted of a fuel compartment

for on-vehicle compressed hydrogen storage.  Hydrogen was leaked

into the bottom of the final compartment at a flow-rate of 3000

standard cubic feet per minute and ignited.  The maximum temperature

rise recorded, excluding the inner surface of the fuel compartment,

was 68&#176;F.  This fuel compartment as tested would require

42 pounds of polypropylene-reinforced concrete foam.  It is believed

that this can be reduced to 12.6 pounds.
