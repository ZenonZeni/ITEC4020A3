VENEZUELAN FLOTATIONS EXPECTED BY SUMMER

The Venezuelan government has set out target dates for the
privatisation of its electricity sector, which it plans to start this
summer and extend through 1997.

Potential investors looking for a widely-spread flotation with the
potential for a large shareholding by the investing public will be
disappointed because the government's intention, at least at this
stage, is to place the bulk of power generation in the hands of a
single private sector investor or joint venture. Indications are that a
minority portion of shares will be more widely sold.

The initial piece of the sector to be placed on the market will be the
Margarita Island utility, which comprises a 146 MW power plant and a
100 MW submarine cable, as well as transmission and distribution
networks.

The regional utility has 90,000 subscribers, a high, 92% bill
collection ratio, and forecasts a demand rise of 8%-10% per year. The
utility, serving a resort area, is 15 miles off the coast.

The privatisation programme, disclosed by officials in Caracas, was
further explained in statements by Luis Xavier Grisanti, Director of
the Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela (FIV), the state holding company
that is overseeing the unbundling process. FIV has $10bn of assets,
half of which are in the power sector (Enelven-Enelco and Enelbar).

According to officials, the state plans to sell Enelbar (Energia
Electrica de Barquisimeto), Enelven (Energia Electrica de Venezuela)
and Enelco (Energia Electrica de la Costa Oriental), and to follow this
- at an as-yet undisclosed date - by the sale of the Planto Centro
thermal power generator. FIV owns 99% of the shares in these three
companies. Planto Central is more problematical, being the country's
largest power generator with 2,000 MW of capacity. Its preparation for
sale will take longer, said Grisanti.

One generation operation definitely not set for privatisation is the
massive Guri hydroelectric complex which is responsible for 10,000 MW
of electricity, more than half of all the country's capacity. The
government has said it will never privatise the hydropower complex;
most analysts concur that it would probably be impossible to do so.

According to Grisanti, the flotations are part of a large privatisation
programme involving tax reforms, establishment of a market-related
foreign exchange rate for the bolivar, a lifting or exchange controls,
price hikes for gasoline/petrol, the opening of the oil sector to
foreign investment (already under way), and an agreement with the World
Bank to supervise the privatisation of the power sector (PLA 5/19, Nov
1995).

In preparation for the flotation, the FIV has outlined a framework, or
action plan, which calls for the establishment of a rational tariff
schedule for 1996/97; a rationalisation of energy prices, such as oil,
gas and hydropower, improvement of utility management, and a market-
oriented regulatory framework for the sector. This last framework was
presented to the Electric Energy Regulatory Commission (CREE) last
autumn and to the utilities in December. The government says the
finalised framework should be ready by next month.

The regulatory framework calls for the following:

* Legal separation of generation, transmission and distribution.

* A single company to operate the national grid; free access to
transmission grid; and establishment of a single power pool.

* Freedom of entry to build generation capacity.

* Distribution companies and large industrial/commercial clients free
to sign direct P & S contracts.

* A new pricing mechanism for the wholesale market; and establishment
of short and long-term wholesale markets.

The action plan also calls for large end users to be able to buy freely
from generators and for distributors to buy wholesale at negotiated
tariffs.

Enelven generates, transmits and distributes thermal power. It has a
labour force of 1,702 and its 1,336 MW of capacity generates 3.6 TWh.
Enelco has a payroll of 480, installed capacity of 40 MW and an output
of 172.953 GWh.

Enelbar's labour force is 896, and its prime operation is to serve Lara
state. Its 150 MW of installed capacity, of which 120 MW is in use,
provides a gross generation of 1.6 TWh.

According to Grisanti, the plan is for a minimum sale of 79.9% of
shares in each of Enelven-Enelco  to a single investor group,
supplemented by an employee stock plan of up to 20%.

A minimum of 79.9% of Enelbar's shares also will be put on the market,
but these will be through an international tender, supplemented by an
employee stock ownership plan of up to 20%.

CHILE'S COLBUN:  PREPARING FOR PRIVATE LIFE

Colbun-Machicura, Chile's state-controlled hydroelectric generator, is
looking for a partner, or even partners, to provide finance and
expertise for a $400m development plan which will double its output in
the next three years.

If the search for a compatible associate is successful, Colbun will
eventually be a sizeable player in the industry, which is currently
dominated by two aggressive private sector companies, Endesa and
Chilgener.

Colbun is not selling off assets, as Jose Luis Mardones, its general
manager, explained in an interview with Power in Latin America.
Instead, the government is using the state company as a way to bring
new competitors into the field, specifically into the central
electricity grid (SIC).

Its model is the northern electricity network (SING), where there are
three private generators - Edelnor (controlled by Southern Company of
the US), Norgener (Chilgener) and Endesa. A controlling share in the
fourth, Tocopilla, owned by Codelco, the state copper corporation, was
awarded this month to a consortium of Powerfin, Iberdrola and Enagas
(see News). In this network prices have fallen steadily over recent
years.

The Colbun management began to develop its plan in the early days of
the Frei government in 1994, and gained approval for it the same year.
It is targeting three main areas, hydro power, gas generation and
transmission.

Hydro

In the hydroelectric sector, Colbun plans to increase capacity from 500
MW to around 730 MW by mid-1998. A first modest increase comes into
commission in May this year, with its 35 MW San Ignacio plant, down
river from the Colbun and Machicura plants. This, its third generating
centre, has cost $30m and was financed mainly with an equity issue
subscribed by existing private shareholders, bringing their share of
the company up from 7% to 15%.

Its fourth centre is the new 108 MW Rucue project, on a new river,
Laja, where it bought water rights from rival Endesa in 1994. Mardones
says preliminary studies are almost finished and a tender is expected
to go out before the end of January. The plant is scheduled to come
into operation in mid-1998 and represents an estimated investment of
$140m.

Gas plants

Colbun plans a move into gas-fired generation by 1998, with a plant at
Limache, in the Fifth Region, one of the most densely populated area
after Santiago. This is a turnkey project (PLA 4/24, Oct 1995), for
which General Electric, Mitsubishi and Siemens are reported to have
been short-listed. The plant will have a capacity of 340 MW-390 MW,
depending on the bid chosen. Colbun had originally budgeted $250m for
this project but now expects to be able to cut the cost by as much as
half.

Mardones said an important reason for locating the plant outside the
Santiago region was that it would not add to pollution in the capital,
which should be declared an ozone-saturated area in March this year. In
addition, being close to sea level gives greater efficiency, compared
to a Santiago site at 1,500ft. Also, the distance is not so significant
as to make transmission costs a major factor in supplying power to the
metropolitan region.

One other factor was also important. According to  Mardones the
government specifically wanted to see natural gas from Argentina taken
to the Fifth Region. Without Colbun's Limache plant, existing and
projected industrial and domestic consumption would not have justified
the $50m extension of the GasAndes pipeline from its route to Santiago.
The Fifth Region is industrially depressed, and the government hopes
the availability of natural gas will give it a comparative advantage
which will enable it to attract new industrial development. (Promoting
government decentralisation policy is not new to Colbun - it opened
offices in the southern provincial town of Talca on government
instructions.)

Transmission

The third plank of Colbun's strategy is a move into transmission, in a
direct challenge to Endesa, whose Transelec subsidiary has a monopoly
to carry power from the hydroelectric generating centres of the south
to the Santiago area.

The decision to build its own transmission line goes back to 1994 when
Transelec announced a hefty rise in its rates, and Colbun started
looking at the option of going independent. Its management decided that
the strategic advantage of having its own lines, and being able to
transmit up to 600 MW at peak time would be a valuable asset, as well
as making it independent of its competitor.

Endesa not surprisingly, has challenged Colbun's project (PLA 6/16, Dec
1995)  and has first option on the most convenient transmission route.
But negotiations are continuing, Mardones says, and Colbun is willing
to share the route and connect with Transelec to avoid duplication. In
that case, Colbun would be willing to upgrade its line to 500 kV and
bring forward its construction schedule to April 1997 to accommodate
Endesa's 447 MW Pangue plant, due on-line then.

But Mardones said a sine qua non was a satisfactory commercial
agreement giving his company freedom to use or sell the excess capacity
which will become available once a transformation bottleneck is
removed. This condition would only be fulfilled, according to Mardones,
if Transelec were to be made independent of Endesa.

In the meantime, Colbun intends to proceed with its plans. On January
3, it announced that it had awarded a contract to Asea Brown Boveri to
build the double-circuit 220 kV line, and given instructions to begin
work immediately. The value of the contract was not revealed, but
Mardones had previously estimated the cost as in the region of $50m.

Advice

Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, has been advising Colbun on
financing for its development plan, and the government is considering
its report. Kleinworts - which also advised on the Tocopilla sale -
recommended that Colbun's best option was to take one or more strategic
partners. In the case of multiple partners, Colbun would be divided
into three companies, covering hydroelectric and gas-fired generation
and transmission.

Among those mentioned as potential partners for Colbun are Southern
Company (operating in Chile as Southern Electric), CMS Energy, Entergy
and Luksic, a Chilean financial-industrial conglomerate (See News).

The latter recently sold a 6% stake in Enersis (PLA 6/16, Dec 1995),
the holding company which controls Endesa and the Chilectra
distribution company, in a move which was widely interpreted as a
declaration of interest in Colbun, though it is also said to have
wanted the cash. It is expected that, as in the case of the Tocopilla
sell-off, current players in the SIC will not be allowed to bid.

Mardones indicates considerable interest in a Colbun partnership,
claiming the company has already received many enquiries from potential
partners. The timing is still not clear, however, and Colbun has
government authorisation to borrow to bridge any financing gap that may
occur.

Colbun is looking for a partner which will not only bring finance,
Mardones insists, but which shares a philosophy and a set of strategic
goals for the future of electricity generation in Chile. Colbun wants
to promote competition in the sector, reduce prices, to protect the
environment and its workers.

In the meantime, Colbun has instituted a restructuring designed to
increase the company's asset values and make it attractive to
outsiders. Management changes have been implemented, and programmes to
cut costs, increase efficiency and strengthen the company's sales
portfolio have been put in place.

Mardones was brought in at the beginning of 1995 from Enami, the state
copper refining and marketing company. In July a new finance and
administration manager with a private banking background was recruited,
and in September, a new development division was set up. This division
has responsibility for the expansion plan.

Since July, Knox D'Arcy, a UK management consultant, has been working
with Colbun on a cost-cutting programme. This, recently completed, is
expected to bring savings of $1m a year, Mardones says, mostly as a
result of cutting out overtime payments. One of the objects of the
exercise was to increase productivity without staff reductions.
Employees have been redeployed to new projects.

A major change has already taken place in sales policy. Until 1990,
Colbun was allowed to sell energy only to the SIC, essentially
supplying other generators. Changes in the law, introduced in 1990,
opened the way for the state company to sell direct to its customers
and it has since built up a portfolio of clients which it considers one
of its major assets.

As of end-1994 it was supplying six distribution companies, including
Chilectra and Chilquinta, and a selection of industrial users,
including El Teniente, Codelco's major underground mine.

Colbun's direct sales activity was boosted further last year with a 29
MW a year contract to supply the Ventanas copper refinery, belonging to
Enami. And it is targeting further growth in direct supplies to
distributors and industrials, irrespective of - but useful to absorb -
its projected capacity increases. Mardones says that there will be news
on this front in the near future.

In 1994, Colbun made an after-tax profit of $55m, with operating
profits of $53m on sales of $124m. Profits in 1995 will show a drop to
around $40m. Although operating profits increased slightly, non-
operating profits were down as a result of lower monetary correction.

Beyond 1998, Colbun expects to continue investing around $100m per
year, developing a series of small hydroelectric plants, using water
rights which it bought in 1994 at the same time as those for the Rucue
plant. It will also eventually be considering a second gas-fired plant.

POWER IN LATIN AMERICA via NewsNet
January 1, 1996

COMMERCIALISING POWER TARIFFS

One of the biggest obstacles to creating a truly commercial electricity
supply industry in Latin America is the continued subsidisation of
power tariffs and, in some cases, a political reluctance to wind down
such practices.

The phenomenon is not new, nor is it exclusive to Latin America, being
rampant in Asia and lurking, chameleon-like, within the power sectors
of Europe and North America.

As students of the power sector in the Third World know, no two
countries are exactly alike - populations, histories and political
systems are different. The same holds true of their electricity supply
industries (ESI), with some systems staggering under the weight of
subsidisation and others attacking the challenge of commercialisation
with vigour.

The theme forms an important part of a new study*, Electricity
Generation in Latin America, by David Kurtz, which examines, on a
country-by-country basis, the generation and supply systems of all
countries - save the Caribbean islands - south of the Rio Grande River.

Kurtz points out that electricity subsidisation grew out of the belief
that lower power prices could curb inflation and stimulate economic
growth, a belief, however honourable, which proved to be folly.

What happened instead in the 1972-88 period was that electricity prices
deteriorated in real terms by 22%, while operating costs rose by around
14%. Power was used inefficiently, bill collection deteriorated and the
financial burden on utilities and governments - most power sectors
being nationally owned - increased to the extent that funds to maintain
and upgrade power generating and delivery systems dried up.

By 1990, the Latin American Electricity Organisation (OLADE) was able
to report, unhappily, that only five of the trade association's 26-
members in Latin America and the Caribbean were charging prices at or
above the long-term marginal cost of power.

Even now in Brazil, which is preparing for a major restructuring of its
power sector, electricity prices are kept low for electoral purposes,
with low prices serving as a disincentive to private investors, which
are unable to gain the necessary returns. (It must be noted that the
noises coming out of Brazil for the past year indicate that the central
government is trying to devise formulas to `take this on' so as to
smooth the way for the partial unbundling of Eletrobras.)

According to Kurtz's study, Brazil's tariffs, through July 1994, are,
at best, very marginal, with domestic tariffs being set at 4.78o per
kilowatt hour; commercial at 5.65o and industrial at just 2.86o. (It is
to be noted that commercial rates in the Indian Subcontinent range
around 7o-plus per kilowatt hour on average. Anything much below 6.5o,
the formula used in Pakistan, is a tight squeeze for independent power
project sponsors.) The study indicates that the worst-case scenario is
seen in Venezuela, where domestic power tariffs average just 0.79o/kWh,
commercial 2.31o and industrial 1.61o/kWh.

There is an upside to this as well, notably in Chile, Argentina and
Peru which have embarked on major privatisation programmes which, in
the case of Chile and Argentina, are all but complete. Their collective
tariff levels are, if anything, slightly higher than those of the US,
where domestic tariffs averaged 8.82o/kWh through mid-1994, commercial
8.08o and industrial 5.02o.

The study takes note of some of the individual tariff variations. In
Argentina and Colombia (See Table) domestic rates are much lower than
commercial rates and lower also than industrial rates. "This pricing
method, which is aimed at gaining favour from the voting public,
disadvantages industry", says Kurtz. "However, with the exception of
Argentina, where many industries are in the public sector, what the
government loses in higher industrial electricity costs it gains from
higher electricity revenues.

"By charging the commercial and industrial sectors higher prices, the
government is, therefore, better able to subsidise the residential
sector's prices, in return for electoral gains."

New players

The report is encouraged, nevertheless, by the momentum behind
electricity reform - there is scarcely a country mentioned in the
report that has not undertaken reforms or that is at least actively
planning them. This will mean an enhanced role for foreign concerns
either through sponsorship of new projects within the region or through
 acquisition of existing assets.

The report breaks down the likely big players - many of them already
stakeholders in various countries even now - into three categories.
Among regional companies are such active Chilean majors as Chilgener
and Endesa; from North America, there are Enron, Duke Power, Dominion
Energy, CMS Generation and Liberty Power/Cogentrix (See Bolivia News).

From abroad, meanwhile, the report notes the activities of Broken Hill
Proprietary of Australia, Spain's Endesa and Iberdrola, and the French
state utility Electricite de France. Not mentioned but certainly very
much a player is British Gas which, since the date of the report's
publication, has decided to shift its all-Americas operational
headquarters out of Texas to Argentina.

In spite of the economic difficulties that have beset Latin America -
some of them almost unique by  global standards, such as hyperinflation
- the region's share of electricity supply is, on a per capita basis,
better than that of Asia, the world's fastest-growing economic region.
The Indian subcontinent, with more than 1bn people, has 3% of total
global installed capacity of 2,911 GW, whereas Latin America, with less
than half that population level, has 6%.

China, bigger again, has 7%, with the rest of Asia and Australasia
taking a 13% share. Europe's share is 35% and North America's 28%
(albeit North America's installed capacity per head is nearly twice
that of Europe). Bringing up the rear are Russia/Middle East at 5% and
Africa at 3%.

What will Latin America's share be by 2003? Kurtz claims, using figures
from General Electric of the US, that total new generating capacity
worldwide by then will be 1,089 GW.  Latin America's share will have
climbed to 8%, while other Third World growth areas, such as
Asia/Australia, the Indian subcontinent and China will have increased
their shares to 22%, 6% and 16% respectively.

It is acknowledged that the European and North American electricity
supply industries are "mature", to say the least. Therefore their
global share of new capacity will have diminished to 18% and 17%
respectively. (It is for that reason that European and American
companies are taking such a high profile role in investing in the
electricity industries of developing countries.)

Another area of significant development is the progress made in recent
decades on the rate of electrification. According to OLADE, this
increased from 40% in 1970 to 70% in 1989. The report does caution,
however, that some of this growth increase stems more from urbanisation
of national populations rather than rural electrification. The report
does not ignore the `convenience' factor in spurring growth - the
growth in the sale of refrigerators, of cookers/stoves and even of
microwave ovens.

The most electrified countries so far are Uruguay, Argentina and Chile,
all at around 92% as a percentage share of population with electricity.
Those with the lost level of achievement are Paraguay, at 60%, Bolivia
at about 53 % and Peru at 48%.

CHILE CONTINUES ARGENTINE WOOING

The love affair between Chilean energy groups and their Argentine
counterparts continued in January, when companies from Chile made
further incursions into the electricity market of their trans-Andean
neighbour. New deals followed the important acquisition last December
of 39% of Buenos Aires utility Edesur by Chile's Enersis for $390m.

Chilean companies, looking for opportunities beyond their own
relatively small - though fast growing - domestic market of 14m people,
have increasingly turned their attention to neighbouring Argentina with
its far larger market of 33m consumers. In the past four years, they
have spent well in excess of $3bn on acquiring large chunks of
Argentine distributors and generators, mainly through the privatisation
process that broke up the old state-owned SEGBA. Along with a few other
countries such as the US and Spain, Chile is now one of the most
important players in the Argentine energy market.

For years Chile and Argentina, very different countries despite their
3,000-mile long shared border, were arch rivals. They nearly went to
war in the early 1980s, when both countries were ruled by military
dictatorships, over a dispute about the Beagle channel. In those dark
days, when Argentina was still pursuing a protectionist development
model, the idea of big cross-border investments was unthinkable.

But stability, democracy and rapprochement between former president
Patricio Aylwin of Chile and President Carlos Menem of Argentina paved
the way for much closer economic ties. Chile's participation in
Argentina's electricity privatisation process, an already functioning
oil pipeline and two planned gas pipelines between the two countries
are evidence that old suspicions are being consigned to history.

Indeed, Chilean groups, facing the possibility of a future energy glut
at home, show no sign of losing interest in Argentina, richer than
Chile, though less stable. With most opportunities in Argentina's
national network having been already bought up, Chilean companies are
now turning their attention to the country's provincial power sector.

Early in January, a consortium led by Emec, a subsidiary of Chile's
Sidgo Koppers group, beat off bids from three other hopefuls, paying
$63m in the privatisation of 90% of Empresa Electrica de San Juan. The
regional utility, which supplies an estimated 130,000 consumers in the
western Andean province, turns over around $60m a year. Emec will hope
to raise revenue well above this level by emulating other Chilean
companies which have a strong track-record of clamping down on the
illegal electricity connections, until recently endemic in Argentina.

The Agua Negra consortium, in which Emec has a 66% stake with the
remaining 34% held by Chilgener unit Hidroandes, may have been prompted
to invest in San Juan by the province's significant potential as a
mining region. Argentina's nascent mining industry, concentrated in the
Andean provinces, will need a reliable energy supply should the big
projects that are being predicted come on-line.

Chilean companies are likely to see further opportunities to purchase
provincial energy companies in Argentina. The federal government in
Buenos Aires is making financial aid to its 23, mostly cash-strapped,
provinces subject to a provincial government's willingness to transfer
state assets to the private sector.

Top on the list with banks are provincial generators and distributors,
many of which lose money and tend to be grossly overstaffed. The
Chileans, with hard-won experience of downsizing Argentine energy
companies, may feel they are up to the job of turning round these loss-
making provincial entities.

Among local governments that have already announced plans to privatise
their energy companies are Mendoza, the prosperous Andean province,
Santa Fe, one of Argentina's main industrial centres, Jujuy in the
north-west and Rio Negro in Patagonia. Chilean groups may to be
interested in all these sell-offs.

On the national scene, the Argentine investment arm of Chile's Endesa
has been active, buying an additional 17% stake in Buenos Aires-based
generator Central Constanera, which, following several expansions, now
has a nominal installed capacity of 1,260 MW, the largest in Argentina.
The purchase brings to 45% Endesa's stake in Central Constanera. Only a
few days before, Endesa had bought a 9% stake in generator Central
Termoelectrica Buenos Aires, itself 51%-owned by Central Costanera.

These purchases follow a flurry of activity towards the end of 1995,
which represented something of a second-wave in the assault on
Argentina by Chile's cash-rich utilities (PLA 6/12, Dec 1995).

This saw Enersis paying $390m for 39% of Edesur and then swapping
shares with fellow-Chilean Endesa to raise its Edesur stake still
further. Enersis is now to concentrate on generation, while Endesa will
stick more to distribution. Chilectra, in which Enersis is the biggest
shareholder, and Chilgener, a Chilean generator, also have important
slices of Argentine utilities. Chilean groups also have stakes in
Argentina's provincial hydroelectric plants, such as El Chocon.

According to Charles Barnett, energy analyst at Smith Barney, Chilean
involvement is a positive development for the Argentine energy sector.
Chilean electric utilities are " undoubtedly the most efficient and
best-managed in the region", he says. Most have now overcome the
initial resentment of Argentine consumers, many of whom baulked at
paying their electricity bills to a company from Chile.

Barnett says the fact that, for example, the future of Central
Costanera is in the hands of "top-notch" management from Endesa should
help to ensure this Argentine generator a bright future. The company's
shares are valued at half those of a typical Chilean energy utility,
but over time, says Barnett, their value is likely to catch up with
those of its Chilean rivals.

Chilean groups have had such success in Argentina that some are now
seeking to repeat the performance in Peru. When Brazil liberalises its
energy sector, there is little doubt that Chilean companies will be
there too.

HAITI REFORMS AWAIT NEW LEADER

An improvement in Haiti's deteriorating power supply will have to await
the installation in February of Rene Preval, who will succeed President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Preval will then indicate whether he will start
the implementation of politically unpopular reforms, including the
divestment of several state enterprises, including the power company.

The state of the company's generation and transmission facilities,
however, will deter "even the most optimistic of potential buyers"
according to a confidential report prepared by a US consulting firm.
"The amount of money which will be needed to make the company viable
will be an obstacle, if not to privatisation, at least to the plans for
a significant expansion in generating capacity", the report said.

The modernisation of the power company will cost about $970m, said Erns
Exceus, head of the government's privatisation programme. The company,
which uses oil-fired generators, has nominal capacity of 217 MW, but is
generating 101 MW, he said.

According to the country's economic development plan, Haiti will need
1,250 MW by 2004, reported Exceus. Current demand is 390 MW, said
government officials, and the shortfall from the power company is being
met by small private generators.

"These are expensive problems, but they also represent opportunities
for investors", Exceus said. The government hopes to set up rural
electrification projects using hydro-electric power, he added. The cost
estimates are "frightening", said Richard Archi, an economist with the
Inter-American Development Bank, which is Haiti's biggest international
creditor.

In addition to financing the expansion of company to meet the planned
demand, the investors will have to deal with the politically sensitive
issue of a significant increase in tariffs.

Haiti, with a population of 7m, is the poorest country in the Americas,
and the report suggests that there is an inadequate client base to
financially support the magnitude of expansion which the government
hopes will happen.

Commercial consumption has also been reduced in recent years as
companies closed after an embargo was put on the country to force out
of office the military which had overthrown and exiled Aristide for
three years. "The prospects for a rapid and significant improvement in
Haiti's power supply are not bright", the report said.

$4BN BID FOR YACYRETA?

A consortium formed by Ontario Hydro of Canada and the US company AES
Americas is reported to have offered $4bn to take over Yacyreta, the
monstrously expensive 3,000 MW hydroelectric plant that the Argentine
economy ministry is keen to shuffle off to the private sector.

Argentine newspapers reported that the consortium had offered $4bn,
more than double the $1.8bn set as a target by the government, after
discussions with Argentina's Energy Secretary, Carlos Bastos. Bastos
denied any such offer had been made, although he admitted talks had
taken place.

A western diplomat close to the negotiations confirmed that
representatives of the consortium had been in Buenos Aires on several
occasions with a view to putting together an offer. He did not know if
a concrete bid had been made.

"Everything is still very much in the air", the diplomat said. The
Argentine government, which owns the still uncompleted dam jointly with
Paraguay, had not obtained the go-ahead to privatise Yacyreta either
from the Paraguayan government or from its own Congress, he said.

"It's not clear whether the Argentine Congress will be amenable to the
deal." Neither had the basis for the sale been properly laid out, which
could explain the huge discrepancy between the supposed offer and the
government's figure. "It`s like trying to shoot at a moving target. The
government is still trying to put a package together and explain
exactly what is on offer."

The proposal from the consortium is said to involve payment of a fixed
sum in return for ownership of, rather than an operating concession for
the dam. The government's idea had been to offer a 20-30 year
concession on Yacyreta. The consortium would then assume all the risks
involved in completing the project, a process that would involve adding
15 turbines to the bring the dam to its full complement of 20, as well
as raising the level of the dam from 76 to 83 metres.

The latter process could involve the potentially controversial and
costly displacement of thousands of people. Indeed, it has taken so
long to complete the project that several hundred poor Paraguayan
families are said to have moved close to the dam so that they can sue
for compensation should they need to be relocated.

Bastos, reacting to the reports, said that if the $4bn referred to was
supposed to represent the whole value of Yacyreta, it vastly
underestimated the dam's worth. Yacyreta, dubbed by President Carlos
Menem of Argentina "a monument to corruption", cost an estimated $8bn
to build.

* Central Costanera has reported a rise in revenues and profits for
1995. Net profits reached $40.9m in 1995 compared to $36.7m in 1994, on
revenues up to $302.2m from $271.9m in 1994.

PEREZ BUILDS BA THERMAL PLANT

Perez Companc, the huge energy-based conglomerate, is to spend $230m on
building a 660 MW gas-fired power station in Ezeiza, a Buenos Aires
suburb. The power station, to be called Genelba, will be the second
biggest in the country after Central Costanera. Perez, which has
important stakes in electricity generation, transmission and
distribution, will feed energy from the plant into its own network.

Perez controls 16.6% of Edesur, through its 32.5% stake in the
Distrilec holding company, 5.99% of Central Costanera, the Buenos Aires
generator, and 9.75% of Transener, which owns and operates the 500 kV
and part of the 220 kV Argentine interconnected system.

Work started in mid-January and the plant is expected to be in
production by 1997. Given current market prices, Genelba should produce
energy worth an annual $130m.

Meanwhile, a second new Buenos Aires plant is also on the cards.
Generator Central Puerto has announced that it is planning to install a
360 MW combined cycle plant in the Argentine capital. The plant,
estimated to cost $140m, should be completed by 1998 and is expected to
produce energy at a 30% discount on conventional thermal power.

Central Puerto is keen to reduce production costs given the sharp rise
in power supply and falling prices. According to ING Barings, the
company is already the most leveraged electric utility in Latin
America, with a net debt/equity ratio of 88.7%

Separately, Central Puerto has merged formally with its 60%-owned
subsidiary Central Neuquen, which supplies electricity to parts of
Patagonia in southern Argentina. The purpose of the merger is to allow
Central Puerto to take advantage of tax credits held by Central Neuquen
worth about $25m.

A LITTLE LIGHT TROUBLE

The privatisation of Light, already delayed from December to March 13
(PLA 6/1, Dec 1995), has run into more trouble.

A few days before the scheduled December 28 publication of Light's
privatisation prospectus, the electricity workers' union, which holds
shares in the company, lodged a legal objection to the proposal to
split the company into two - the viable Light Rio, and Light
Participacoes, which would retain the company's 47% stake in the
country's largest distributor Eletropaulo and the R$1bn or so of the
latter's debts to Light.

Light has around half the capital of Eletropaulo whose total value is
put at R$3.5bn (US$3.6bn)  - interestingly close to the new, higher
estimates of Light's value, R$3.7bn, despite its R$1bn of Eletropaulo
debt. According to the Brazilian press, Eletropaulo - whose cost-
cutting includes laying off 5,000 staff in 1995 - is expected to be
operating efficiently in three year's time when Light's stake is
expected to be worth around R$4.5bn.

Although the objection was subsequently overturned in the courts, it
led to the postponement of a shareholders' meeting to OK the split,
which in turn is considered likely to delay the auction date by a
further two weeks to the end of March.

Brazilian observers of the process say, however, that even the end
March deadline is too optimistic and is likely to be met only if Light
desists from the split, which is now due to be approved by shareholders
at the end of January and sells the company along with its debts.
Otherwise, they say, the auction is likely to take place at the
earliest in May.

This will include an element of shares for sale to consumers via a fund
set up in the middle of January by Banco do Brasil. The minimum
investment in the new fund, BB Investment Privatization Fund-Light, has
been set at R$200. Deposits will be held in a fixed interest account
until the Light auction date, when they will be used to purchase
shares. Banco do Brasil estimates that the fund would attract R$50m-
100m. It intends to establish similar funds for subsequent
privatisations.

Meanwhile, once Light is out of the way, Eletrobras intends to move on
to other sales. It is currently studying a strategy for further
privatisations that would begin with Furnas, the south eastern
generator, which has been asked to prepare alternative scenarios for
its future.

These include the sale of one hydroelectric dam; the sale of several
dams on the same river basin or the division of Furnas into several
parts. Furnas is to present its recommendations by the end of January.
Eletrobras controls three other regional generators - Eletrosul,
Eletronorte and CHESF - but Furnas is the most important in terms of
population, industry and consumption. The company currently generates
54 GW and plans to double its capacity in the next 12 to 15 years.

* Emmanuel Nobrega Sobral was appointed president of Eletropaulo at the
end of December. Sobral, formerly Eletropaulo's financial director,
replaces Paulo Feldmann.

ENERGETICA SALE SET FOR APRIL

The auction of Nacional Energetica has been set for April. Originally,
it was thought that the company - with assets of R$185m (US$190.2m) -
would be sold in January, following the November liquidation of its
parent, Banco Nacional, which went into liquidation and was absorbed in
December by Unibanco.

Nacional Energetica, left on the shelf by Unibanco, is currently under
Central Bank control. Its main asset in the energy sector is a 51.54%
stake in the 1,300 MW Serra da Mesa dam on the River Tocantins in Goias
state. The project, under construction in partnership with regional
generation company Furnas Centrais Eletricas, is scheduled for
completion by April 1998, and is expected to generate earnings of $100m-
$400m a year.

Work on the dam continues apace despite the uncertainty over Nacional
Energetica's ownership thanks to Brazil's National Development Bank,
BNDES, which is providing project finance to the tune of R$57m. This
amount is sufficient for construction work to continue until the end of
March. Camargo Correa is carrying out civil engineering on the dam
which is now 70% complete. Nacional Energetica had invested R$247m in
the dam up to the start of this year, and and BNDES - which has pledged
to provide the remaining finance for the project - R$153m.

Nacional Energetica's president, Victor Paranhos, said in late January
that he had already been approached by 28 parties interested in the
company, including nine power companies (seven from the US) the Iven
Consortium which controls Escelsa, and Camargo Correa, Brazil's largest
construction company.

CEEE, CERJ PRIVATISATION PROGRESS

The state energy company of Rio Grande do Sul state, Companhia Estadual
de Energia Eletrica - CEEE, was authorised to open its capital to the
private sector by the state legislature in late December following the
presentation of a bill to this effect in November (PLA 6/2, Dec 1995).

A maximum of 49% of the shares in CEEE - estimated to be worth between
R$2.8bn (US$2.9bn) and R$5bn - will be sold under the proposal. The
company, which has debts of $90m, 9,800 active staff and 2,600
pensioners, is currently 99.8%-owned by Rio Grande do Sul state.

The next step is the evaluation of the company's assets and the drawing
up of a model of energy production and distribution in the state. Three
consortiums and an individual company submitted bids for this task on
December 28: Fator, Nera, Mercados and Arthur Andersen; Andersen
Consulting, Kleinwort Benson, Termoconsult and MMSO; Projeta, Deloitte
and Engevix; and consultant Booz, Allen & Hamilton do Brasil
Consultores.

Prequalifying technical proposals drawn up by the competitors will be
submitted for judgement in mid-January, while their prices for CEEE
will be presented in early February. The winners of the process will be
announced at the beginning of April.

The state government wants the consultants to give a clear definition
of all the steps necessary to place CEEE shares with their true value
on the market. It expects to have this information plus  details of an
energy plan for the state ready by the end of June 1996.

According to state energy secretary, Assis Alberto de Souza, CEEE
should invest R$150m in 1996 with $100m being financed by an issue of
debentures. In 1995 CEEE invested just $37m.

Rio Grande do Sul is the only Brazilian state where coal-fired power
stations predominate using local low grade, high ash deposits. Foreign
companies have shown an interest in making the plants more
environmentally-friendly in recent years. Neighbouring Uruguay has
complained of acid-rain caused by the plants.

The state government will be pressing for coal-fired solutions given
the jobs they sustain in the local mining industry.

Other regional privatisations are also progressing. Rio de Janeiro
state's Companhia de Energia Eletrica de Rio de Janeiro (CERJ) is
currently speeding towards the private sector.

At the end of December the state established a commission to manage the
process of selling off 14 of the state's 26 companies, and has just
published a prospectus for consultants to evaluate CERJ's assets and
prepare it for privatisation. CERJ distributes 25% of the state's
power, serving 1.2m customers; employs 4,806 staff (down from 5,758 a
year earlier) and had debts of R$54m in 1994.

The deadline for bids for the contract to advise on the CERJ
privatisation model isMarch 11, with the state announcing the winner a
month later. The privatisation reports are scheduled to be presented by
the end of August, allowing for privatisation in September. The
National Development Bank (BNDES) has agreed to lend the state R$244m
on the back of anticipated privatisation receipts.

Meanwhile, Mato Grosso state has also recently joined the bandwagon,
with an announcement that the state government was launching a series
of administrative reforms that would make possible the privatisation of
Cemat, as well as the regional bank, Bemat.

These will include regulations for offering concessions for public
services to the private sector and the removal of state subsidies. A
bill authorising the privatisations is expected to be sent to the
legislature by June this year.

* Sao Paulo state's secretary for energy, David Zylbersztajn, has sent
a bill to the state legislative proposing the creation of a public
energy service commission which will have the mission of regulating and
controlling electric energy services in the state.

CPFL UPS SALES, CUTS COSTS

Sao Paulo state electricity company, CPFL (Companhia Paulista de Forca
e Luz), has registered increased power consumption of 6% in 1995, with
an increase of 90,000 in its customer baseto 2.2m, mainly located
outside of Sao Paulo city.

Whether this will be sufficient to help stave off the worst of its
immediate financial problems, however, remains to be seen. In the first
nine months of last year, the company produced a five-fold increase in
net losses, and analysts at Brazil's Garantia bank are forecasting full
year losses of R$84m (US$86.4m) compared to a profit of R$22m in 1994,
as a result of higher operating costs and lower tariffs in real terms
following the July 1994 price freeze.

According to company president, Cesare Manfredi, CPFL is tackling its
costs, and anticipates savings of R$27m in 1996. In 1995, it
restructured its administration and reduced staff from 7,700 to 6,900.

The company has also worked on a restructuring of its business
divisions. In line with the unbundling proposals of state energy
secretary David Zylberstajn, it has now separated the accounting of its
generation, transmission and distribution sectors. CPFL has also
divided its operations into three business units: South East, North
East and North West.

CPFL plans to continue to invest next year, despite the cutbacks,
planning expenditure of R$90m, with R$30m of this used to maintain and
expand its system. During 1996 CPFL intends to build new sub-stations
at Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Lencois Paulista, Campinas, Sumari, Itapira
and Americana.

Amongst Brazil's electricity supply concessionaries, CPFL boasts the
shortest and the least frequent electricity supply interruptions.
CPFL's maximum period of interruption was 8.7 hours while the Brazilian
average was 16.5 hours. CPFL had an average interruption frequency of
6.7 per client compared to 21.5 nationwide.

There are three electricity concessionaries operating in Sao Paulo
state, CESP (Companhia Estadual de Sao Paulo); CPFL and Eletropaulo.
Sao Paulo, covering an area the size of the UK, is Brazil's most
populous state with over 33m inhabitants and is responsible for around
45% of the country's GDP.

ENERGY DEMAND RISES 7.6%

Brazil used 7.6% more energy in the eleven months to November 1995 than
in the same period in 1994, according to the latest statistics released
by Eletrobras. The figures for the full year should show a rise of 7.8%
says Eletrobras, well above the annual average of 3.3% registered in
1990-1994.

Electricity consumption clearly outstripped Brazil's GDP growth of
around 4% and points to energy shortages in the short-term if
investments are not stepped up in the sector.

A significant part of Brazil's increased energy consumption comes from
residential users. Since the introduction of the country's successful
anti-inflation plan in July 1994 there has been a marked increase in
the purchasing power of low income families who have acquired more
electric domestic appliances.

In 1994 these sales rocketed by 35% over 1993. In 1995 these rose a
further 15% with 40m units sold. As a result of using these appliances,
a large number of electricity consumers have moved into the category of
users of over 200 kW/month.

HYDRO OUTPUT BREAKS RECORDS

The world's largest dam, Itaipu, jointly-owned by Brazil and Paraguay
broke its own record in 1995 by producing 77.21 TWh. This was 11.2% up
on the level achieved in 1994. The increase was due to reduced
generator stoppages through improved maintenance programmes. The 18
turbines operated at 93% capacity during 1995. The 77.21 TWh
represented 31% of all Brazil's energy production in 1995.

Despite the progress, Itaipu is still owed large sums - R$1.4bn
(US$1.44bn) - by Brazilian energy distributors. The state government of
Sao Paulo (CESP, CPFL and Eletropaulo) is the largest debtor, owing
$1.2bn for energy used. The remaining $200m is owed by Eletrosul,
Furnas and ANDE.

Meanwhile, output is also breaking records at Companhia Estadual de Sao
Paulo (CESP), which beat its 1993 annual generation high at 10 a.m. on
December 22 last year, with output of 52 TWh. CESP is Brazil's largest
generating company, responsible for 22% of the country's energy
production. It is able to cover the equivalent of all consumption by
Brazil's 38m households. The company expects its revenue from
distribution to increase by R$9m in 1995.

NEW CHAIRMAN FOR BOLPOW

Bolivian Power Co, the only private sector power generator in Bolivia,
has announced the appointment of E. Glen Biggs to succeed Frank Benner
as board chairman. Benner will remain a director of the company, which
has the rare distinction for a Latin America power generator of being
quoted on the New York stock exchange.

The company also announced that Bruce McMillen, senior group vice-
president and chief financial officer of Cogentrix Energy of the US,
had resigned from Bolivian Power's board. He is succeeded by David
Lewis, presently chief executive at Cogentrix Energy.

Bolivian Power, founded in 1925, distributes and transmits power in La
Paz and Oruro. It has a 34% share of all generation in the country,
operates 13 hydo facilities with a total capacity of 134 MW and is
expanding by 62 MW its hydro capacity in the so-called Zongo Valley
project.

Part of this capacity will be on-line this year and all will be
delivering power by 1998. It is also installing a gas-fired plant of 17
MW at El Alto near La Paz, which went on-line last summer. It is
considering a 230 MW hydropower operation in the Miguillas Valley. Its
growth rate this decade has been in excess of 6%.

Bolivian Power's shareholding includes a 17% stake held by Liberty
Power/Cogentrix Bolivia Inc. According to the New Electricity Law, it
will divest itself of power distribution responsibility, and will focus
on generation. Its net income last year was $7.7m on a turnover of
$45.9m.

TOCOPILLA FLOATED

Codelco, the state copper corporation, has chosen a consortium of
Belgium's Powerfin, Spain's Iberdrola and the domestic Enagas as its
strategic partner for the Tocopilla power plant.

The decision was made eventually a month later than the scheduled late
December date as a result of a lengthier and more complex due diligence
process than Codelco had anticipated

The agreement calls for the formation of a new equity partnership in
Tocapilla Holding Ltda., which controls the 615 MW, coal-fired
Tocopilla power plant near Antofagasta in northern Chile.

Powerfin has a 62.5% stake in the bidding consortium, with Iberdrola
holding 25% and Enagas having the balance. The consortium will pay
$177. 8m for a 51% stake in Tocopilla, with Codelco controlling the
remainder. Codelco is to set up a new company to own the 51% stake,
which will in turn be 51% owned by the bidders.

The remaining 49% of Tocopilla will also eventually be sold, 10% to the
plant's workers and the remainder through local exchanges or ADRs.

Powerfin's parent Belgian utility Tractebel said that some $70m needed
to purchase Tocopilla will be funded through project financing. The
balance of $110m will come from the three bidding companies.

Tocopilla consists of ten units, a port and 600 km of high-voltag e
transmission lines. It has a workforce of 400 and will be operated
jointly by Iberdrola and Powerfin under the latter's lead. The site's
electricity is sold mainly via long-term contracts to northern Chile's
copper mines, including that of Chuquicamata, the world's largest open-
pit copper mine, and will supply Codelco's El Abra joint venture with
Cyprus Amax Minerals (130,000m tpy), when it starts producing in late
1996.

Meanwhile, the plant has recently picked up yet another mine contract,
signing a 20-year deal to supply Codelco's Radomiro Tomic mine, which
will have output of 130m tpy from 1997. The Radomiro Tomic contract is
estimated to be worth $55m and is for 70 MW from 1998 to 2002, rising
afterwards to100 MW. It will use part of the same transmission system
as the El Abra mine. A contract for the latter has been awarded to the
Spanish-Chilean firm Abenor S.A.

CONSUMPTION SOARS 9.2%, ANOTHER 8.8% SEEN IN `96

Chile's electricity consumption soared by 9.2% last year compared to
1994, reports the National Energy Commission (CNE). The figures showed
demand for liquid fuels climbed 7.4%, while coal consumption was 14%
higher.

"The sector has been able to supply in an opportune way the growing
energy requirements which are the result of the country's strong
economic and social development", CNE president Alejandro Jadresic
said.

The forecast is for a further increase of 8.8% this year. The energy
sector is one of Chile's most active, with projects worth more than
$4bn under construction or in advanced planning. These include thermal
and hydropower stations, two natural gas pipelines and expansion
projects at oil refineries.

According to the CNE, the two trans-Andean pipeline schemes continue to
advance. CNE`s records show that the GasAndes scheme, led by Chilgener
and Canada's Nova Corp. had already presented its environmental impact
study for approval and has negotiated 85% of the rights of way needed
for the pipeline scheme. TransGas, headed by Tennedo of the US and
British Gas had not yet presented its environmental impact study. It
had agreed 65% of its rights of way, said Jadresic.

Both plan to supply Chile with natural gas from central Argentina but
by different routes, Gasandes linking the Neuquen gasfields in northern
Argentina to Santiago, the Chilean capital, and TransGas traversing the
Andes by a more southerly route.

GasAndes says it will start laying pipe on the Argentine side of the
border in January. In Chile, they are waiting for approval of their
environmental impact study but say they are still on schedule. They are
meeting steady opposition from neighbourhood groups on the route down
to Santiago through a local beauty spot, the Cajon del Maipo.

LUKSIC, US GROUPS TIE UP ATACAMA PIPE SCHEME

CMS Energy and the Williams International Pipeline Co. of the US plan
to go ahead with the Atacama gas pipeline project and have signed
letters of intent with the local Luksic group. Luksic would take a 15%-
20% stake in the $350m project while CMS and Williams keep 40%. The
project is still looking for an Argentine partner.

The pipeline would bring gas from Jujuy in northern Argentina, near the
Argentinan-Bolivian border with northern Chile, to Tocopilla on Chile's
north coast, with branches further north to Iquique and south to
Antofagasta. The new timing is for an open season in the first half of
this year with work starting before the end of the year and the pipe
coming into operation in early 1998.

CMS and Williams say they need to sign contracts with power generators
for between 600 MW and 800 MW of capacity for the project to be viable.
The initial capacity of the pipeline would be 3.4 MMcm per day. Some
doubt has, however, been expressed as to the immediate viability of the
project.

The new Collahuasi copper mine has signed a contract with Endesa (PLA
3/13, Sept 1995) for power which will be generated by its new coal-
fired Patache plant. In the view of the government's National Energy
Commission (CNE), this alone is sufficient to postpone the supply of
gas to the area for the short and medium-term.

It is not clear that the generating companies of the northern
electricity network will want to convert from coal to gas. But a
spokesman for Williams says they are confident about getting the
contracts they need.

The project, if it goes ahead, could bring to three the number of gas
pipelines running from Argentina. The northern link would complement
the more complex Gas Sur and Gas Andes pipelines schemes being prepared
to deliver gas from Central Argentina to the Santiago/ Concepcion areas
on Chile's central west coast.

ENDESA GETS RALCO DAM LICENCE

Endesa has been awarded a two-year provisional licence by the state
auditing board for the controversial 570 MW Ralco dam project on the
Bio Bio river.

The authorisation was given in the face of strong opposition from
environmentalists and locals, who were concerned about the visual
impact on the site, a beauty spot, and the enforced relocation of the
Pehuenche Indians who live nearby.

The licence will allow the state generator to begin detailed studies
into construction prospects for the $600m dam and to examine its impact
on the environment. Endesa wants the hydro plant to be on-line by 2002.

CHILGENER PLANS $500M INVESTMENTS FOR `96

Chilgener's G-M Jose Antonio Guzman announced investments of $500m for
1996. These could rise to $650m depending on the success of the
company's bids in privatisation sales in other Latin American
countries.

Financing will come mostly from bond issues. For example Chilgener this
month issued a `yankee bond,' placing $150m on the US market in the
form of 10-year bonds. The bond issue was placed by Smith Barney, Chase
Securities and ING Barings. A separate private place of $180m will help
refinance its Gualcolda power plant.

The Empresa Electrica de Santiago, which is building the Nueva Renca
gas-fired power plant and in which Chilgener has a 51% stake, will not,
according to Guzman, need new financing. The plant will be built using
suppliers credits.

* Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Baa-1 rating to the $150m
bond. The rating reflects Chilgener's solid financial position and
sound business strategy, says Moody's, emphasising that the company is
also operating in a stable regulatory and economic regime.

About two thirds of the company's resource portfolio is thermal, with
the balance mainly run-of-river hydropower units. Concerns about
Chilgener's higher production costs relative to hydro-based competition
are largely offset by growing electrical demand in Chile and Argentina
and by the company's ability to maintain reliable production regardless
of rainfall conditions, says Moody's.

ENERSIS BOOSTS CAPITAL THROUGH MAJOR SHARE OFFER

The holding company, Enersis, which controls Endesa, the power
generator, and Chilectra, the Santiago distributor, has made a $240m
share offering. The 30-day preferential share option lasted to mid-
January.

Demand in the Chilean market, however, has been high and the options
which the private pension funds have been unable to take up because of
legal limits on exposure have been bought up by other shareholders or
future investors.

The capital increase will go towards financing the company's two major
investment projects - its successful bid for 39% of Edesur, the
distribution company which serves the south and centre of Buenos Aires,
and a planned bid for Rio Light of Brazil.

Together with its distribution subsidiary, Chilectra, Enersis paid
$390m for its new stake in Edesur. Short-term financing took the form
of a syndicated loan from five international banks but a bond issue is
expected to follow.

At the end of December, Enersis transferred a 5.6% stake in Edesur to
the local Chispas investment companies for an estimated $55m. The pre-
arranged move is to help diversify the holdings of the Chispas so that
they become eligible for private pension fund investment. Currently,
the Chispas' main asset are their shares in Enersis.

POWER CRISIS DEEPENS

After a year of chaos in electricity sector, with brown-outs of up to
eight hours a day in the second half of last year (PLA4/4, Oct 1995),
Ecuador is settling down to an equally difficult 1996.

The year began about as badly as was possible. In the second week of
January, electricity employees declared a two-day strike in protest at
the government's power sector privatisation bill, which was expected to
be passed by Congress that week.

The bill foresaw the unbundling of generation, distribution and
transmission and the extention of private sector access to the system.
It also proposed the consolidation of the existing 19 distributors in
the country into four or five companies, as well as the restructuring
and sale of 49% of state-run INECEL. Its proposals also included the
creation of a regulatory agency.

The strike, only affecting administrative functions, was threatening
also to hit the country's already disabled power station production as
PLA went to press, notably the Paute hydro plant, which was in the
hands of the strikers and which provides some 60% of the country's
power.

President Sixto Duran Ballen, meanwhile, has ordered the army to take
over the running of the plants should the bill be passed.

The bill, deadlocked in parliament for almost two years, had been
hailed as the solution to the country's deeper capacity problems, by
facilitating the construction of privately-owned plant. Ecuador
currently has 2,300 MW of installed capacity, but only 1,590 MW of
effective, guaranteed capacity, short of the current 1,760 MW of demand
and leaving no margin for the 6% growth forecast for last and this
year.

PERU OUTLINES EXPANSION PLANS

Jorge San Roman, Peruvian vice-minister for energy, is predicting a
further 218 MW expansion of generating capacity in 1996. This should be
enough, he says, to preclude power supply problems - always provided
that rainfall is normal.

The bulk of the extra 218 MW will be made up as follows: 100 MW in the
first phase expansion of Edegel, the recently-privatised collection of
hydro and thermal plants serving Lima; 20 MW from the expansion of
thermal capacity at the Zorritos plant, 60 MW from Pucallpa and 13 MW
from Tarapoto.

Additionally, by early 1997, San Roman expects there will be a further
140 MW available from Ventanilla, Lima's thermal power station which
was acquired in December by Endesa of Spain (PLA 6/18).

In a recent interview, San Roman justified the government's decision to
continue with the exemption from the selective consumption tax (ISC)
for fuel used for thermal electric generation.

"There should be no exceptions to taxes applied", he said, "but in this
case it is necessary, otherwise electricity tariffs would have risen".
He accepted that Peru's increased reliance in the short-term on thermal
energy would mean steeper import bills for diesel.

Not all government officials are as sanguine as the vice-minister over
electricity sector prospects. Luis Haro, director-general for
electricity at the mines ministry, told a conference in early January
that current reserves stood at barely 5% of generating capacity when
they should ideally be at 20%.

MANTARO HYDRO HITS TROUBLE

The Mantaro hydro complex, backbone of electricity generation for
central and northern Peru and scheduled for privatisation in the near
future, is facing serious problems.

Experts predict that, given the precarious state of the concrete lining
of the main, 20km tunnel between the main intake and the machine house,
the jewel in Electroperu's hydro crown may fetch far less than
anticipated when it reaches the auction block later this year or next.

Mantaro comprises two separate hydros known as Santiago Antunez de
Mayolo and Restitucion. Together they account for a quarter of total
national electricity generation capacity.

Mantaro's generating potential is 1,015 MW, with normal output ranging
between 850 and 900 MW. Today it is generating a bare 715 MW due,
according to consultants, to build-up of solids in the tunnel and,
probably, the deterioration of the interior walls. The tunnel has never
been emptied for maintenance work in the 22 years since it opened.
Attempts last year by the Canadian company Aquatic Sciences to carry
out inspections with robots were unsuccessful.

OUTPUT UP 3.3% IN 10 MONTHS

Electricity output rise by 3.3% in the first ten months last year
compared to 1994, reports the Energy and Mines Ministry. Total output
stood at 12,236 GWh, said the report.

It said that electrical production, including output from Peru's
interconnected north-central, southwest, southeast and other isolated
systems reached 11,840 GWh in the January-October period. Power from
hydro plants accounted for 84.6% of total output while thermal power
generation made up 15.4%.

According to the statistics, public service firms produced 10,521 GWh
while companies generating their own captive power accounted for 861.3
GWh. Electroperu, the largest of the country's seven state-owned power
generators, produced 6,332 GWh, followed by recently privatised Edegel,
which had an output of 2,203 GWh, and Egasa 587.8 GWh. Peru's total
output in October rose 2% to 1,233 GWh compared to 1,209 GWh in the
same month in 1994.

* The Peru stock exchange has approved the listing of Edelnor. The
state sold 60% of Edelnor, which distributes power in northern Lima to
a consortium of Chilean, Peruvian and Spanish interests for $176m. The
consortium comprises Inversions Distrilima, led by Enersis, and
Distribuidora Chilectra Metropolitana of Chile and Spain's Endesa.

system were to be added at a later date.

Only three of the initial four US companies which signed an MOU last
August (PLA 2/20) to develop the $200m complex - El Paso Natural Gas,
Panhandle Eastern Corp and Maple Resources Corp - are still on board.
Entergy, which was to have operated the power plant, has pulled out.
The three new participants are Pennsylvania Light & Power arm, Power
Markets Development Company; Illinois Power arm, Illinova Generating
Company; and Scudder Latin American Power.

Work on the project is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of this

GUYANA POWER SECTOR REHAB PLANS HIT SNAGS

Guyana's urgent effort to rehabilitate its decrepit electricity system
and impose a measure of private commercial discipline (PLA 6/20, Dec
1995) is running into snags.

Trade union pressure last month forced the resignation of Raymond
Gaskin, chairman of the Guyana Electricity Corp. (GEC). He had been
appointed by President Cheddi Jagan himself. The main electricity
union, the National Association of Agricultural, Commercial and
Industrial Employees (NAACIE), had taken exception to the speed with
which Gaskin, with government backing, was trying to commercialise the
operation, including successive power supply rate hikes and the sacking
of up to 213 workers.

NAACIE even called a strike at GEC, illegal in an essential service, to
put pressure on Gaskin to withdraw retrenchment notices. He accused the
union of having a `political agenda' and blamed him for the fact that
`things are not going well at GEC.'

Gaskin said he felt he had no option but to resign after the union fed
`lies' about him to the People's Progressive Party (PPP), the senior
partner in the governing coalition, and to the government itself. The
former chairman can claim some credit for making efforts to improve the
troubled utility, whose performance record is probably the worst in the
Caribbean, with the exception of the Dominican Republic's state-owned
electricity company.

He was instrumental in obtaining additional units from various foreign
sources to reduce the gap between supply and demand, and the rate hikes
enabled GEC to do away with treasury subsidies. he also tried to root
out corruption at the corporation, and several former employees are
before the courts on charges of electricity theft and misuse of GEC
funds.

Gaskin's forced departure is only one of the setbacks facing GEC in its
desperate effort to move forward.

The $12m joint venture between the government-owned bauxite company,
Linden Mining Enterprise (Linmire) and the US Resources Recovery
International, has been put on hold following objections by the
government's privatisation unit. The government unit felt the project
should have been put to tender on a wider basis. The joint venture
company was to install 19 MW of new capacity, 5.5 MW of which would
have been sold to GEC.

The $309m investment by four US companies, trading under the name of
United Health Clinics (UHC), to create power from waste, has also been
stalled.

Senior government officials apparently do not believe the group can
deliver what it says. The proposal was to supply up to 60 MW to the
national grid by using heat generated from all types of local waste.
The government investment promotion agency, the Guyana Office for
Investment (GO-Invest) was in favour of the scheme and seemed satisfied
with the bona fides of the participants. But other officials have
stepped into the picture and demanded better feasibility studies of the
project.

GO-Invest's director, Dr. Ivor Mitchell, says he will pursue the matter
because he has seen waste-to-electricity plants operate successfully in
the US and says "I believe they can work in Guyana".

LOCAL TIE-UP STRENGTHENS BIDDERS CHANCES

The two front runners in the bid to purchase the state-owned Jamaica
Public Service Company, the island's electricity monopoly, have formed
consortia with local companies - a move which bankers say will
strengthen their chances of being selected.

Although the government has an official short list of five prospective
buyers, the two which are considered the leading contenders are Houston
Industries Energy Inc of Texas, and Southern Electric of Georgia. Less
fancied are Enterprise Diversified Holdings and Charter Oak Energy,
both of the US, and Ontario Hydro of Canada.

Southern Electric has created its consortium by drafting Life of
Jamaica and Mutual Life, two of Jamaica's largest life insurances
companies. Houston Industries Energy has been joined by Island Life and
Manufacturers Merchant Bank.

"These arrangements will enhance the chances of the companies in their
bid to purchase the Public Service Company, and the final decision by
the government's Divestment Committee could be influenced by what the
local firms can bring to the table", explained one of Jamaica's leading
bankers who is advising one of the consortia.

Life of Jamaica and Mutual Life are joining Southern Electric as
investors. Island Life will also be an investor with Houston Energy
Industries, while Manufacturers Merchant Bank will provide financial
services support. Southern Electric has also recruited influential
support in the form of Andrew Young, the former US ambassador to the
United Nations and mayor of Atlanta, who has been visiting Jamaica
frequently to lobby for the Atlanta company.

Robert Pickersgill, Jamaica's utilities minister, and several
executives of the Public Service Company, have visited the US
headquarters and major power installations of both Houston Industries
Energy and Southern Electric. Government officials say "nothing of
significance" should be read into the fact the installations of the
other three bidders were not visited.

Jamaican officials are also studying the operations of Trinidad &
Tobago's electricity company in which Southern Electric took a 49%
stake just over a year ago.

The government is hoping that the sale of the power company, which is
scheduled to be concluded by the middle of this year, will be followed
by increased stability in power supplies. The company currently has
capacity of 663 MW and average production is 505 MW to meet peak demand
of 405 MW.

With the commissioning of privately owned barge-mounted and land-based
plants, it will have output for the national grid of well over 700 MW
by August.

Jamaicans will feel the effect of the change in ownership almost as
soon as the sale is complete. The government will require the
successful bidder to modernise and improve the Public Service Company's
efficiency by spending about $800m over 15 years. This will not be
financed solely from the company's operations. It reported a net profit
of $5.8m in the 1994-95 fiscal year, $7.5m less than the previous year.

Company officials have complained, however, that the firm's finances
would have been better had the government granted a tariff increase.
The last increase was granted in 1991, and the government has been
reluctant to make adjustments, apparently because it would be
politically unpopular.

Lee W. Hogan, chief executive of Houston Industries Energy, has warned
that divestment of the Public Service Company will be followed by a
rate increase. If his company's bid were successful, Hogan said, it
would try to curb the hike in rates by selling more power.

"You make more money by selling more energy", he said. "The way to make
money in this business is to maximise growth, not price." An acceptable
rate of return for the company would be between 8.5% and 9% on total
assets, adjusted to debt and interest charges, he said.

The Public Service Company's financial position would have been
stronger in the 1994-95 year, were it not for an explosion at the Old
Harbour Station which destroyed over 100 MW of capacity, said Derrick
Dyer, the company's chief executive. "This is not a fire sale", he said
of the impending divestment. "The company is very much alive and
kicking and, in many respects, is a showpiece for other developing
countries. This is the opinion of international agencies."

MEXICO PUTS ITS CLOCKS FORWARD

Mateo Trevino, who is head of the Mexican government's energy saving
organisation, has one very basic problem.

His job is to convince consumers and producers that wasting electricity
makes no economic sense. But with electricity tariffs that themselves
make little economic sense his task is a difficult one. This year, he
and his organisation, the Support Trust for the Energy Saving Program
(FIDE), have to convince the country to put its clocks forward by an
hour for six months, a change the government thinks will bring about
annual savings of $1.5bn.

A presidential decree establishing Mexican `'summer time" appeared in
the Diario Oficial, Mexico's version of the Federal Register, on
January 4 of this year.

Environmental interest groups and government officials said that the
measure,which will affect Mexico's three time zones from April 7 to
October 27, should save up to 1% of the energy the country currently
uses, through rationalising the use of extended daylight hours. From
1996 on, clocks will be set forward one hour on the first Sunday of
each April and back on the last Sunday of each October.

According to Rogelio Gasca Neri, Director General of Mexico's Federal
Electricity Commission (CFE) the time change should result in fewer air
contaminants being released, as well as more efficient dispersion of
airborn pollutants.

The adoption of summer time is the first step of a six point energy
plan Trevino has the responsibility of promoting. In its entirety, the
plan aims to reduce Mexico's energy consumption by 7.3% by the year
2000 through rationalisation of energy use. By the government's own
reckoning, electricity wastage has already fallen by 5% in recent
years.

As a country with many remaining infrastructure problems and hundreds
of isolated communities, Mexico rations itself when it comes to
executing large scale changes in popular perceptions. A proposal to
introduce summer time in 1992 was brushed aside because at the time the
Mexican government was busy with a programme to re-denominate the
currency.

`'The need to introduce summer time has not been so pressing in Mexico
as it has been in countries further to the north, with greater seasonal
variations in their day", said Trevino. `'But we clearly need to create
a culture of energy conservation.''

Many of the campaigns promoted by Trevino and FIDE aim at the
electricity consumer rather than the producer, such as is the case with
two programmes that seek to introduce the use of more efficient light
bulbs and air conditioners. Revamping existing electricity generation
and transmission equipment to increase efficiency and reduce waste is,
after all, a very costly proposition.

NEW ENERGY MINISTER APPOINTED

A Mexican government reshuffle in the dog days of 1995 took most
commentators by surprise by its timing and heralded changes in the
energy sector.

President Ernesto Zedillo's late December restructuring of his cabinet
removed Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, the former energy secretary, and
something of a member of the ruling party's old guard, replacing him
with Dr Jesus Reyes Heroles, an economist.

Pichardo's position had greatly weakened since he took office a little
more than a year before. Troubled by ill health, and - particularly
during the beginning of his time at the energy ministry - afflicted by
political controversy, Pichardo never seemed the natural choice to
preside over the privatisation and liberalisation of much of Mexico's
energy policy.

At the beginning of 1995, tensions appeared to arise between Pichardo's
energy ministry and the Finance ministry with regard to the future
course of energy privatisations and liberalisation. He will now move on
to a post within the Mexican foreign office, most likely as a diplomat
overseas.

Pichardo's successor, Jesus Reyes Heroles, son of a Mexican politician
from a generation before, won early recognition as head of a Mexican
economics thinktank, Grupo Economistas y Asociaciados.

In the job he held immediately prior to his new appointment, Reyes
Heroles served as head of Banobras, a Mexican state development bank,
where he tried to up investment by innovative schemes including the use
of seed money. Whether he will try similar mechanisms in a sector where
private spending has drawn close to a halt is yet to be determined.

CFE CONFIRMS EXPANSION PLANS

Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) announced that over the
next two years it plans to increase its installed generation capacity
by 2,250 MW, to reach a national total of 35,702 MW to meet national
demand.

In a press release, the CFE emphasised the importance of plans to begin
operating units three through six of the geothermal Cerro Prieto
complex, in Baja California, as well as referring to the 350 MW unit 4
of the coal fired Carbon II programme, in the northern state of
Coahuila, and the thermal combined cycle units 5 and 6 of the Adolfo
Lopez Mateos project, which between them will provide 700 MW for the
town of Tuxpan.

The CFE said that hydroelectric dams will be put into commercial use in
the northwestern state of Sinaloa, where two 200 MW units should come
on-line, as well as between the southern states of Veracruz and Oaxaca,
where the Temascal dam will have two units of 100 MW each, and between
the central areas of Hidalgo and Queretaro, where the Fernando Hiriart
dam will have two units of 140 MW each.

The release said that at the beginning of the Zedillo administration in
December 1994, 1,675 MW of capacity was being tested to be put into
operation, while 2,251 MW was in the process of being contracted or
constructed, all of which should enter into operation before the end of
1997.

During 1995, 1,345 MW was put into operation, leaving 2,581 MW to be
switched on over the next two years.

* Luz y Fuerza del Centro, the main electricity distributor in the
Mexico City area with 24m clients, has contracted the services of
Spain's Union Fenosa Acex to begin a modernisation process. Acex is the
international consultancy arm of Union Fenosa, Spain's third largest
utility.

The contract, which will involve a major technical renovation at Luz y
Central, underlines Fenosa's presence in the region, where it already
has development and technical transfer projects with utilities in the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Colombia.

ARGENTINA CALLS FOR TENDERS FOR OIL EXPLORATION

Argentina is calling for tenders for oil exploration in seven areas
near disputed waters around the Falkland/Malvinas/Malouines islands.
Tenders will have to be lodged by January 31, says the Energy
Secretariat. Britain withdrew objections last year against oil tenders
in waters bordering its claims after an historic agreement with
Argentina. The agreement allows both countries to charge royalties for
any oil or gas extracted from Falkland waters - Argentina plans to levy
3% and Britain 9% without compromising their conflicting claims to
sovereignty. British Gas and YPF will jointly study hydrocarbon
potential off the islands.

As far as Falkland locals are concerned, there are still tensions, says
Richard Ralph, the new British governor. He said locals do not bear
Argentina any ill-will, despite the 1992 Argentine invasion (and
subsequent eviction with extreme prejudice), but do not wish to have
much, if anything, to do with Argentina so long as sovereignty is
disputed. Despite increased potential for co-operation, notably in
energy and fisheries, Argentines travelling on national passports are
not allowed on the Falklands, apart from relatives visiting the graves
of sons killed in the war.

CHANGO NORTE X-1 EXPLORATION WELL

Ampolex, the oil and gas producer, says that its Chango Norte X-1
exploration well in Argentina, in which it has a 23% stake, has flowed
gas and condensate from a short-term production test. Australia-based
Ampolex said a drill stem test conducted over the interval 3,318 to
3,690 metres recorded a flow of 19 MMcfd of gas through a 3/4 inch
choke at a pressure of 2,300 pounds per square inch over a five-hour
period. A total of 723 barrels per day was recovered.

Ampolex has been active in the Aguarague field since June 7, 1995, when
the XP-1 field showed gas in three formations. It is now test flowing
at 25 MMcfd. Other participants are Tecpetrol 23%; YPF 30%; Petrobras
15%; Cia General de Combustibles 5% and Ledesma 4%.

BOLIVIA RECEIVES BIDS IN PARTIAL PRIVATISATION OF YPFB

Bolivia has received bids from 40 foreign companies in the partial
privatisation of state oil company Yacimentos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos (YPFB), according to vice president Victor Hugo Cardenas. He
said the government expected to complete the company's capitalisation
and to announce the winning bidders by May.

The bidders included BHP Petroleum, Elf Aquitaine, Repsol, Ampolex,
Esso, Exxon, Nova, Panhandle and Unocal.

The capitalisation programme will involve the division of the country
into two regions for exploration and production. In addition,
transport, refining and servicing divisions will be split into three
separate companies, while marketing and distribution will be subdivided
into three other competing firms.

The successful bidders will gain control of a 50% stake and managerial
control.of the companies, which they will be obliged to invest in. The
remaining 50% of shares will be allocated to Bolivia's pension funds.

CALOR GROUP EXPANDING IN LATIN AMERICA

The Calor Group of the UK is further expanding Latin American
operations with a $31m investment in Supergasbras Distribuidora de Gas,
the Brazilian liquified petroleum gas major. The UK group's investment
has been matched by SHV Energy, its joint venture partner in SHV Calor
Brazil, which was set up last year. Calor and SHV are spending $62m for
a 49% stake in Supergas and 50% of the voting rights. Supergas lost
$4.2m in 1994.

Calor was in the news last August with the acquisition of a majority
stake in Minasgas, a bottled gas supplier. It is understood Supergas
and Minasgas will be operated as separate companies. Calor said it
would encourage rival suppliers to draw up a co-operation arrangement
for the future. The two companies supply a combined total of 1.35mt of
LPG to a customer base of 40m people. Calor announced last year plans
to spend #70m ($110m) in projects in Latin America and Asia in
conjunction with SHV Energy, the privately-held Dutch group with
ultimately controls Calor. The strategy is to broaden Calor's base
outside the UK market.

PIPELINE MAY NOT GO AHEAD

Hondo Oil & Gas of the US is expressing fears that a natgas pipeline
planned by it and Amoco may not go ahead because of changes in pipeline
tariffs and natgas prices. The company said also that its Opon No. 5
development well has been delayed indefinitely because of right-of-way
disputes with landowners. Hondo said the Comision de Regulacion de
Energia y Gas had set a ceiling price for natgas and a maximum rate of
return of 12.5% (before local taxes) for pipeline tariffs. The ceiling
is interpreted to include costs or fees for the processing of natgas,
thus processing costs cannot be passed on to buyers.

As a consequence, these regulations "will reduce the amount the company
expects to receive for natgas and pipeline tariffs in the future", the
company said. The regulations affect the terms agreed to in a MOU with
Ecopetrol for the construction of a pipeline and the sale of natgas.
The agreement was signed on July 31. It calls for an 88 km pipeline
from the contract area to Ecopetrol's refinery at Barrancabermeja.
Negotiations are continuing with Ecopetrol to seek relief from the
regulations so the project can be got under way.

BP'S COLOMBIAN OIL AND GAS RESERVES

Good news for BP in Colombia where oil and gas reserves are now much
larger than originally estimated. BP will be producing 1m bbl of oils
within 10 years, slightly less than what comes out of the UK sector of
the North Sea. BP is staying mum but did acknowledge that output from
the Cusiana-Cupiagua field was rising fast and that 500,000 b/d could
be in production by end-1997. Last month's production would be 180,000
b/d, up from 40,000 b/d in 1994. Guerrilla activity remains a threat
and are estimated to have caused $45m in damage to pipeline and other
facilities since 1986.

CUBA HOPES TO PRODUCE MORE CRUDE THIS YEAR

Cuba hopes to produce some 1.5mt, or about 11.3m bbl, of crude this
year, fractionally up from last year's figure of 1.45mt and 1.28mt the
previous year. Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, said the
increased production was due to new technology and injection of capital
and resources through linkups with foreign companies. Current
production was less than one-fifth of the country's total needs of
about 7.5mt a year. Cupet, the Cuban petroleum company, has been on an
investment drive overseas in an attempt to line up more joint ventures
with foreign oil exploration groups.

GOVERNMENT NAMES PRESIDENT OF PETROECUADOR

The government has named Patricio Lopez, an army general, as president
of Petroecuador. Lopez is a former aide-de-camp to President Sixto
Duran Bailen. He succeeds Federico Veintimilla, who stepped down
recently along with top managers after allegations of mismanagement.
Petroecuador produces 330,000 b/d of the Andes nation's 380,000 b/d. It
is now undergoing a major restructuring as a result of the top-level
cleanout, which led to the resignation of all managers at Petroecuador
subsidiaries, such as Petroproduccion, Petrocomercial and
Petroindustrial.

The alleged irregularities were in connection with the purchase of
27.5m gallons of diesel from Hiperoil, a local company which had
imported it from Venezuela. Hiperoil is claimed to have added undue
taxes to the sale price for a profit of 30bn sucres ($10.2m), reports
Reuters.

PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP GAS FIELD IN NORTHERN MEXICO

A consortium of US firm Conoco, Canada's Nova Corp and Canadian Hunter
Exploration have presented a proposal to develop a potentially enormous
natural gas field in northern Mexico, according to a report in the Wall
Street Journal. Under the terms of the proposal, made several months
ago, the group would agree a long-term service contract with Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex) to explore for and produce gas at Burgos Basin,
bordering Texas. The companies, which would be equal partners in the
deal, would initially invest $100m in the project.

If successful, the proposal, said to be in a very early stage of
discussion, would be taken as a signal that Mexico may relax its
restrictions on foreign involvement in the energy sector. Mexican law
currently forbids foreign ownership of its energy resources.

PERU'S OIL PRODUCTION

Peru's oil production fell 4.36% in 1995 from an average of 127,309 bpd
to 121,762 bpd, according to a report from regulatory agency Perupetro.
The fall was blamed on problems over the past few months with the
depletion of old wells before new wells came on-stream. Officials
expect the situation to improve in 1996, following last year's
signature of deals with foreign oil producers, and the start of a four-
year privatisation programme for Petroperu.

The country produced a total of 44.44m barrels in 1995 compared to
46.47m in 1994, said the report, with some 95.1% produced by state oil
firm Petroperu (14.54m bbl), Petro-Tech (7.09m) and US firm Occidental
Petroleum (20.64m). Private contractors accounted for the remaining
4.9%.

more than 1995". PDVSA gave no figures for projected crude output
capacity or the budget that was approved. The company said recently
