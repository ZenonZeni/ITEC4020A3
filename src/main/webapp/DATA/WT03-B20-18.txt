<H1>Climate change<BR>
and the UNCED "Earth Summit"</H1>
<HR>
<B>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) was held in 
Rio de Janeiro on June 3-14, 1992.</B>  This so-called Earth Summit took place 20 years after the 
1972 Stockholm Declaration1 first laid the foundations of contemporary environmental policy.  As a 
high-level forum with universal participation, UNCED’s main aim was to show the way to a new 
global strategy for reconciling development needs with environmental protection.  The key results of 
UNCED were the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, Forest Principles, and two international conventions, 
one concerning climate change, the other biodiversity.  The decisions taken and the documents 
adopted by UNCED are likely to have important implications for the future international response to 
climate change, as well as for virtually every other environmental issue.<P>
<B>UNCED’s success was made possible by the two-year preparatory process that preceded 
the actual Earth Summit.  </B>A Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for UNCED, established by 
the <A HREF = "fs205.html">UN General Assembly</A>,2 began its work 
in early 1990.  The PrepCom received guidance from a number of UN bodies on how to address 
UNCED’s various topics.3  It established three working groups and held an organizational meeting 
and four substantive sessions between March 1990 and April 1992.4  The PrepCom dealt extensively 
with UNCED’s primary concern of integrating environmental and development aims to promote 
sustainable development.  The work relating to climate change focused on assisting and monitoring 
efforts already underway in <A HREF = "fs209.html">the 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(INC/FCCC)</A> and in other UN bodies.5<P>
<B><A HREF = "fs250.html">The United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change</A> was signed at UNCED by 153 States and the European 
Community. </B> After 15 months of tough negotiations, the Convention was adopted in New 
York on May 9, 1992 by the INC/FCCC.  The negotiations were concluded in time for the treaty to 
be officially opened for signature in Rio, as intended. UNCED was considered the proper forum for 
affirming the international community’s support for this important international treaty.  (The other 
legally binding document signed at UNCED was the Convention on Biological Diversity.)<P>
<B>The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development adopted at UNCED sets out <A 
HREF = "fs202.html">key principles</A> of relevance to climate 
change.</B>  Although not legally binding, the Declaration contains 27 principles intended to shape 
future international and national action on environment and development.  Some of these principles 
had already been affirmed at climate change and other international conferences, such as the common 
but differentiated responsibilities of states at different levels of development, the need for sustainable 
development, and the precautionary principle.<P>
<B>Agenda 21, UNCED’s 40-chapter environmental action agenda for the 21st century, 
contains a chapter on protecting the atmosphere.</B> Chapter 9 of Agenda 21 recommends 
measures that governments and other bodies can take to improve the scientific understanding of 
climate change, to promote sustainable energy use and production, and to reduce the damage caused 
to the atmosphere by transport, industry, resource development, and land use.  Chapter 9 also makes 
recommendations about the related issues of <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">stratospheric ozone depletion</A> and <A HREF = 
"fs225.html">transboundary atmospheric pollution</A>.  This chapter was 
one of the most difficult to negotiate and caused substantive disagreements up to the last moment.
