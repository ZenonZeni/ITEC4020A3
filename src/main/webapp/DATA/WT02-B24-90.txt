<h2 ALIGN=CENTER> How to  Participate Effectively in the IEP Process </h2><p>

<p>As the parent of a child with special education needs, you should
learn how to use the IEP (Individual Education Plan) process as an
effective tool to obtain appropriate special education and related
services for your child. 

<h3>You Should Know: </h3>
<ol>
<li>What an IEP is 
<li>How to prepare for an IEP meeting 
<li>What an IEP must include 
<li>How to write your own IEP input statement 
<li>How to participate effectively in an IEP meeting 
<li>How to use positive communication skills to build a cooperative
home/school relationship 
<li>How to obtain appropriate special education and related services for
your child through the IEP 
</ol>

<h3>What is an IEP? </h3>
<p>An IEP is a written document which is developed at an IEP meeting.
Federal Law requires that a written individual education plan (IEP) be
developed and reviewed annually. (121a. 344 PL 94-142) 

<h3>Preparation for the IEP Meeting</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Obtain your  child's  school  records.</b>  The Family Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA) insures your right to examine school records, receive
an explanation of the contents,  challenge the contents, and obtain
copies of all records.  <b>Before</b> any IEP meeting, <b>all</b> records
maintained  by the school must be made available to you. [Access  Rights
(121a.502, 121a. 562)]
<br>
<li><b>Prepare a file of your child's evaluations. </b> Review the
school's diagnostic/eligibility written report. This report must contain
the nature of your child's disability, eligibility status,
classification, written observation reports, signatures of the school
team. (Review evaluation purpose 121a.500; 121a.530-532; SLD Regulations
of 12/29/77, 121a. 540-543) 
<br>
<li><b>List skills you believe your child is ready to learn or should
have learned. </b> This is especially important if you believe your child
has greater abilities than those stated by the school team. 
<br>
<li><b>Make an outline of what you believe your child's IEP should
contain </b>based upon your child's evaluations and consultation with
appropriate professionals. Remember to bring this file to the meeting. 
<br>
<li><b>Talk to other parents of children with specific learning
disabilities. </b> Learn as much as you can from them about their IEP
experiences. Contact your local LDA Unit. 
<br>
<li><b>The school must send you written notice of the IEP meeting.
</b>The time and place must be mutually convenient. The school must
indicate who will be in attendance. (121a.504-505; 121a.344-345) A copy
of  your  legal rights should be included in the written notice.
<br>
<li><b>Bring a friend, another parent, a relative or advocate  for
support.</b> Some parents feel overwhelmed at an IEP meeting. It may be
helpful to obtain a copy of the Federal Regulations to the Education of
the Handicapped Act,  PL 94-142, and your State Rules and guidelines for
Special Education. Also very helpful is a copy of <CITE>Interpretation of
the Individualized Education Program</CITE>, published by the U.S.
Department of Education in the  Federal Register. January 19, 1981. The
Federal sources are available through your Congressional representatives.
Your State Department of Education can provide you with state
information. You may also want to contact  your local LDA unit. 
</ol>

<h3>The IEP Meeting</h3>
<p>Participate in the IEP meeting confidently. It is your right and
obligation.
<ol> 
<li>The IEP meeting must include:
<ul>
<li>A representative of the school, other than the child's teacher, who
is qualified to provide, or supervise the  provision of special
education. The representative must have the capacity to commit the agency
resources so that whatever services are set out in the IEP will not be
vetoed at a higher administrative level within the agency. (Federal
Register 1/19/81, #13) 
<br>
<li>The child's (student's) teacher 
<br>
<li>One or both of the student's parent(s) or guardian 
<br>
<li>The student, where appropriate, as determined by the parent(s)
(Federal Register 1/19/81 #13) 
<br>
<li>For a handicapped student who has been evaluated for the first time,
the school must include someone who is knowledgeable about the evaluation
procedure used with the child and is familiar with the results of the
evaluation. [121a.344 (b)(2)] 
<br>
<li>Other individuals at the discretion of the parent or agency.
<br> 
</ul>
<li>Parents have a right to clear explanations in everyday language. Do
not hesitate to ask for clarifications if needed. 
<br>
<li>Parents may tape IEP meetings (Federal Register 1/19/81 #12)
<br>
<li>An IEP must be agreed upon (and short term instructional objectives
written) before special education and related services are provided to a
handicapped child. The extent and duration of both regular and special
education and related services must be written at the initial meeting. 
<br>
<li>An IEP must be in effect within 30 days of determination of
eligibility and thereafter at the beginning of each school year.<br>
<li>Special education also includes access to vocational education with
appropriate modifications, accommodations and remedial services. (121a.
143; Federal Register 1/19/81 #50) <br>
<li>Ask for a copy of the IEP. <br>
<li>An IEP can be revised if you feel it is not working.<br>
<li>IEP meetings can be called at the request of the parent or the
school.<br>
<li>Federal regulations do not require parental signature on the IEP.
</ol>
<h3>Your Child's IEP Should Consist of: </h3>
<ul>
<li>A statement of your child's present educational  performance level<br>
<li>A statement of annual goals, including short term instructional
objectives<br>
<li>Specific special education and related services to be provided and a
statement of the extent to which your child will participate in regular
education programs<br>
<li>The dates for initiation of services and the anticipated duration of
services<br>
<li>Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and
schedules for determining at least annually, whether instructional
objectives are being achieved <br>
<li>All accommodations and modifications necessary for participation in
regular education programs (Federal Register 1/19/81 #48)<br>
<li>A statement of the least restrictive environment (LRE) 
</ul>
<p>An <b>annual goal</b> is a general statement of desired changes and
progress through the year. Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"To increase ______'s word analysis skills from 2.1 to 3.4 as measured by
the  ______test(s)"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>A <b>short term instructional objective</b> is a measurable,
intermediate step between a child's present level of performance and the
annual goal established. The objectives are based upon the logical
breakdown of the major components of the annual goals and serve as
milestones for measuring progress towards  meeting the  goals. They
describe what the child is to accomplish in a particular area within a
time specified period (Federal Register 1/19/81 #39)
<p>These objectives direct the sequential efforts for closing the gap
between the child's indicated ability and his functioning.
<p>Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>"________ will be able to discriminate between the short 'i' and short
'e' sounds. By mid-October, orally given 20 new words containing the
short 'e' and short 'i' sounds, _____will respond with 85% accuracy."
<p>"________ will be able to analyze the syllables in multisyllabic words.
By November 15, ________ will be able to identify the number of syllables
in a list of 25 new mullisyllabic words presented visually with 90%
accuracy."
<p>"________ will continue work on basic subtraction concepts, fractions
(understanding equivalent), and addition facts through 20. By January,  
________ will be able to define and explain the terms numerator and 
denominator and will add fractions with 
like denominators with 90% accuracy."
<p>"By mid November, ________ will show increased ability to attend in
group work settings as determined by both  ________'s self monitoring
records and teachers independent probes as demonstrated by a 40% increase
in attending behavior."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3>Your Child's IEP can be implemented through:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A regular class in a public school, with appropriate supportive
related services
<br>
<li>A special class in a public school, with appropriate supportive
related services, as necessary
<br>
<li>A special public high school
<br>
<li>A special education program in private day or residential school
which meets state standards
<br>
<li>A home or hospital program
<br>
<li>A special education program in a residential facility
</ul>
<p><B>Appropriately related/supportive services must be provided to meet
your child's needs as indicated in the IEP.</b>
<p><b>These include, but are not limited to:</b> (121a.13)
<ul>
<li>Speech and language services<br>
<li>Psychological services, social work services, counseling services<br>
<li>Special readers, braillists, typists, and interpreters <br>
<li>Physical and occupational therapy, adaptive physical education, and
other necessary therapeutic services <br>
<li>Consultative services <br>
<li>Supportive institutional services <br>
<li>Medical services for evaluation and diagnostic purposes, and school health nurses <br>
<li>Parent counseling and training <br>
<li>Resource Centers <br>
<li>Transportation services <br>
<li>Vocational Education
</ul>

<p>The need for related services is determined by an appropriate
evaluation of the child's needs. If you feel your child is in need of a
specific related service, and it is not included, you should request an
evaluation in that specific area.
<p>The IEP should state each needed related service, the <b>date</b> of
the initiation or the service, prescribed time(s) per week (days(s)).
person(s) to render service, and the anticipated duration. The IEP should
state whether the service  will be  provided on a one-to-one basis, in a
group, or only by consultation with the classroom teacher. Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Speech and language remediation for 15 minutes daily on a one-to-one
basis and 25 minutes three times per week in a group of no more than
three children with similar language needs with the Speech and Language
Pathologist.
</blockquote>
<p>When requesting related services, you should base your request on the
premise that your child needs a given service in order to benefit from
his/her special educational program.
<p><b>Your child should receive appropriate non-academic and extracurricular
services</b> (Federal Register 1/19/81 #48, 49, 50)
<ul>
<li>Adaptive physical education (OT/PT) <br>
<li>Music, art, home economics, shop <br>
<li>Other non-academic subjects that other children in your school are
receiving <br>
<li>Recreational opportunities that other children in your school are
receiving
</ul>

<h3>Parents and Professionals May Disagree</h3>
<p>The law insures a process for resolving differences. It you cannot
come to an agreement you may request another meeting. Do not feel
pressured  to make a decision immediately. You might wish to initial
those areas with which you agree and request a 30 day interim IEP.
(Federal Register 1/19/81 #35) 
<p><b>Independent Evaluations</b><br>
Parents may obtain an independent evaluation and request another meeting
based on the new evaluation. Consult PL 94-142 section 121a.503 and page
52511 for additional information. Independent evaluations that seek a
diagnosis of the disability can frequently be financed through third
party (insurance) carriers if the evaluations are obtained through
professionals such as clinics, psychologists, pediatricians, neurologists
etc. Specific Learning Disabilities are recognized medical conditions. 
<p><b>Complaints</b><br>
If needed services are not provided in the IEP or recommendations from an
independent evaluation are not considered you may file a complaint with
your State Department of Education (seeking mediation) (121a.602 and
EDGAR) or file for a Due Process Hearing. (121a.506-513)*
