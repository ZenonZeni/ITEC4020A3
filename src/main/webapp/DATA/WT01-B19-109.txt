<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>A probation-revocation hearing has been delayed for a Waterloo man who could go to prison for using marijuana for medicinal purposes.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Allen Helmers, 48, had been scheduled to be in Black Hawk County District Court Monday afternoon for a hearing that could have ended with him being sent to prison.  The hearing, however, was delayed and is now rescheduled for Oct. 28.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers has said his doctor believes marijuana is the only thing that can effectively relieve pain caused by fibromyalgia syndrome, a disease that attacks the body’s soft tissue.  The cause is unknown and there is no cure.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Previously, Helmers was sentenced to two five-year suspended prison sentences and $1,800 in fines stemming from a police search of his home that uncovered about three ounces of marijuana he was using to ease the pain from his condition.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers was placed on two to five years of supervised probation, including periodic urine tests.  Because he continued using marijuana, the probation could be revoked and a prison term could be imposed.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>There are only eight people in the United States allowed to smoke marijuana legally for medical reasons.  All were given permission under a federal program that was shut down by the Bush administration in 1992.<BR>
