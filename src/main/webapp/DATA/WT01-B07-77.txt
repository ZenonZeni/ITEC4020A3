Abstract: Knowledge of air flow patterns and thermal parameters
are essential in the design of a ventilation system for large
enclosures. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the possibility
of using computer simulation to predict the airflow pattern and
removal effectiveness of ventilation systems in large enclosures.
The quality of air and thermal comfort in a three-floor shopping
centre are studied by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method.
Two ventilation systems are selected. In System 1, rooms are ventilated
by two ceiling slot diffusers, supplying air downward into the
rooms. The halls are equipped with wall jet diffusers, delivering
air in a horizontal direction. Airflow and air quality, under
both summer and winter conditions, are investigated. In System
2, the air in each room is supplied in a radial manner by four
ceiling rectangular diffusers. The hall and balconies have jet
diffusers which supply air vertically downward. Different ventilation
rates, outdoor air ratios and supply air temperatures are studies.
Occupants are simulated by heat and CO2 sources without aerodyamic
blockages. It was found that the summer and winter air temperature
difference in the shopping centre differ by approximately 2 oC.
The rectangular air diffusers should be used in the rooms and
the jet diffusers in the halls and balconies. Both the variable
air volume and the constant air conditioning control in a large

Abstract: In this article, five k-e, two-equation models are studied:
the standard k-e model, a low-Reynolds-number k-e model, a two-layer
k-e model, a two-scale k-e model, and a renormalization group
(RNG) k-e model. They are evaluated for their performance in predicting
natural convection, forced convection, and mixed convection in
rooms, as well as an impinging jet flow. Corresponding experimental
data from the literature are used for validation. It is found
that the prediction of the mean velocity is more accurate than
that of the turbulent velocity. These models are neither able
to predict anisotropic turbulence correctly nor to pick up the
secondary recirculation of indoor air flow; otherwise the performance
of the standard k-e model is good. The RNG k-e model is slightly
better than the standard k-e model and is therefore recommended
for simulations of indoor air flow. The performance of the other
models is not stable.

Abstract: The CFX software from Computational Fluid Dynamics Services
(CFDS) is used routinely by a number of major companies in the
building industry. Founded on more that 20 years experience in
CFD modelling, CFX is a general purpose CFD code which boasts
geometrical flexibility, advanced physical models and powerful
numerical methods. A CFX simulation predicts the velocity fields,
pressure and temperature at all points within or around the building,
data which can then be visualised with the state of the art graphical
post processors in the software. The resulting images provide
the designer with a clear and detailed understanding of the efficiency
of the HVAC systems, information which would be prohibitively
expensive or impossible to obtain experimentally.

Abstract: Differential flow control is the most common method
of room pressurization practiced today. It has long been applied
to constant-volume spaces and is now frequently applied in variable-volume
rooms as well. However, differential flow is not a direct indication
of pressurization. As a result, questions have lingered about
where it should be applied and what it takes to ensure success.
This paper analyzes the relationship between a controlled differential
flow and the actual infiltration flows from the surrounding spaces.
Several fairly simple cases are examined to establish some limits
on the applicability of this concept. The following conclusions
are drawn. The method is extremely reliable when the pressurized
space is in contact with one other space. In more complicated
layouts, infiltration paths significantly increase the flow difference
needed for negative pressurization. Also in more complicated layouts,
changes in the surrounding pressures can cause pressurization
to fail. Infiltration paths to spaces with varying pressures (including
the outside of the building) should be minimized.

Abstract: This paper presents four new empirical equations for
the prediction of the centreline velocity in front of circular
and slot exhaust openings, both plain and flanged. Such new, easy
to use equations come from a mathematical treatment of the experimental
data obtained by the authors. The suggested equations were developed
by means of a regression analysis fitting the experimental data.
Finally the dimensionless predicted velocities inferred from the
authors' equations were compared with the ones derived from the
main empirical equations available in technical literature for
the calculation of centerline velocity gradients in front of freestanding
hoods.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to predict
the indoor environment of a mechanically ventilated room and overall
ventilation effectiveness of air distribution systems. The predictions
of indoor thermal comfort is based on Fanger's comfort equations
incorporated into the CFD model. A radiation heat exchange model
is included for the calculation of mean radiant temperature as
well as heat transfer through room boundaries. The overall ventilation
effectiveness is related to the energy required for achieving
indoor thermal comfort and good air quality. These indices were
used to evaluate room air distribution systems for heating and
cooling operations. It has been found that the most effective
air distribution system for heating operation differs from that
for cooling. It is shown that an air distribution system that
results in upward displacement ventilation performs better than
others in terms of indoor air quality and energy use by may cause
local thermal discomfort.

Abstract: Local thermal discomfort in offices with displacement
ventilation is investigated using computational fluid dynamics.
The standard k-e turbulence model is used for the prediction of
indoor air flow patterns, temperature and moisture distributions,
taking account of heat transfer by conduction, convection and
radiation. The thermal comfort level and draught risk are predicted
by incorporating Fanger's comfort equations in the airflow model.
It has been found that for sedentary occupants with summer clothing
common complaints of discomfort in offices ventilated with displacement
systems result more often from an unsatisfactory thermal sensation
level than from draught alone. It is shown that thermal discomfort
in the displacement ventilated offices can be avoided by optimizing
the supply air velocity and temperature. It is also shown that
optimal supply air conditions of a displacement system depend
on the distance between the occupant and air diffuser.

systems. Three different kinds of air diffusion models are studied
for summer cooling conditions. These air diffusion types include
a one inlet-one outlet, a two inlet-one outlet, and a one inlet-two
outlet diffuser in an indoor environment. Evaluation of thermal
comfort is made in terms of the percentage dissatisfied (PD) and
air diffusion performance index (ADPI). A complete computed field
is presented and discussed using an air flow velocity vector,
temperature profile, and contours of PD as well as ADPI.

Abstract: The ventilation design concept, model experiment results,
two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation, and on-site
measurements are presented for the Danish Pavilion project at
the 1992 World Exhibition in Seville. The paper gives a short
project history for the building and the ventilation system. The
air-conditioned restaurant and exhibition hall have a floor area
of 450 m2 (4,850 ft2) and a mean height of 18m (59 ft). It is
ventilated by a 'cooling wall' with a height of 12m (39 ft). The
flow from the cooling wall is similar to the flow in a room with
displacement ventilation. Scale-model experiments and computational
fluid dynamics simulations indicate a velocity level in the occupied
zone of approximately 0.6m/s (120fpm) and the results are confirmed
by on-site measurement in the exhibition hall. It is shown that
even a simplified two-dimensional flow simulation will give valuable
information to be used in the design procedure.

Abstract: Glazed facades may cause thermal discomfort due to downdraught.
Convectors placed close to the facade can prevent downdraught
but cause an increase in the energy consumption. The objective
of the research has been to investigate if the structural system
of a glazed facade can be used to reduce downdraught and to avoid
thermal comfort problems in the occupied zone. The effect of large
obstacles on a cold boundary layer flow has been investigated
for different temperature differences between a cold surface and
the room air, different distances between the obstacles and different
sizes of the obstacles. The effect of the obstacles on the boundary
layer flow depended on the characteristics of the flow and of
the sizes of the obstacles. With turbulent flow and an obstacle
larger than the boundary layer thickness the boundary layer flow
separated from the surface and a new boundary layer was established
below the obstacle. The risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraught
was reduced considerably.

Abstract: In buildings with large glazed facades there may by
problems with thermal discomfort due to downdraught. Convectors
placed close to the facade can prevent this but they will cause
an increased energy consumption. Recent research has shown that
the risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraught can be reduced
by structural measures. Laboratory experiments has shown that
large obstacles, such as the structural system of a glazed facade,
which is placed in the cold boundary layer, can reduce downdraught
considerably. This paper deals with the ability of Computational
Fluid Dynamics to predict downdraught at a plane wall and at a
wall with large obstacles. Quite simple boundary conditions were
used in this study. Predictions of the main flow characteristics
and the velocity levels in the occupied zone showed reasonable
results.

Abstract: Natural ventilation systems assisted by passive stacks
are currently designed without incorporating heat recovery leading
to wasteful heat loss. Heat recovery is not used because the pressure
loss caused by a conventional heat exchanger is large and could
cause the ventilation system to fail. The heat pipe promises higher
capacity because it has much higher thermal conductance than conventional
heat exchangers. Individual heat pipes can be independently located
in ventilation stacks, making it easier to achieve lower pressure
drops. Experimental results show that for a heat recovery efficiency
of 50% and stack flow speed of 0.5 m/s, the pressure loss across
an existing type of heat-pipe assembly is about 1 Pascal. Computer
simulation of pressure and flow loss caused by heat-pipes was
carried out using computational fluid dynamics. It has been shown
that heat-pipes located at the bottom of the stack produce greater
insertion flow loss (IFL) than those located at the top and heat
pipes next to the stack walls give rise to less IFL than those
in the centre. Furthermore, it has been shown that the IFL is
the preferred indicator. The temperature of the heat pipe has
little effect on flow loss performance of the heat exchangers.

Abstract: Flow over and around a building is computed using the
F3Dke model, which is based on the k-e turbulence model. The convection
term is approximated using the hybrid upwind (HU) and the streamline
upwind (SU) procedures. Fine and coarse grids are considered to
study flow features and pressure coefficients. Flow separation
on the roof and sides of the building is captured using the fine
grid but not the coarse grid and the HU and SU procedures. The
computed flow features over a two-dimensional building using the
SU procedure are similar to the wind-tunnel model prediction.
The computed pressure coefficients using coarse and fine grids
are almost the same for two-and three dimensional buildings. The
computed pressure coefficients around a building at a university
compare well with field measurements.

Abstract: The two-layer methods combining the k-e model in the
external, fully turbulent flow region with either the one-equation
model or the low-Reynolds-number modified k-e model in the near-wall
area have been tested in computing the wind conditions around
a cubic building. Results were compared with those from the k-e
model computation as well as those from the experiments. Comparison
shows that neither the k-e model approach nor the modified k-e
model-based two-layer method can represent the flow separation
above the roof surface and near the side walls. The one-equation
model based on the two-layer approach, however, is effective in
predicting the separation. The numerical prediction of the wind
induced pressure n building surfaces, especially on the roof and
side walls, is also improved as compared with the other two methods.

Abstract: Two new tools have been developed for the analysis of
wind effects on both ventilation systems and building constructions.
They make possible the optimisation of an investment in natural
ventilation systems; mechanical ventilation system performance
and the type of building construction. Up till recently, lack
of knowledge and poor estimations of difficult to predict wind
effects have often led to ventilation systems with no optimal
performance and to poor building design in relation to wind hinder
and wind load. This increases ventilation costs. Measures to reduce
wind problems on buildings afterwards are often not fully effective,
while costs are much higher compared to measures taken in the
design stage. Present analysis tools, like wind tunnel tests and
computer model studies, and considered relatively expensive and
not well fitted to serve designers' needs. The two new tools have
overcome these disadvantages and costs are reduced to about 10%.
Data input and output are easy to handle by users with little
experience.

Abstract: Contains a final synthesis of the simulation exercises
on the Collins building, consisting of the thermal simulation
of a commercial building coupled with a VAV conditioning system,
performed within the IEA - Annex XVII research project (Building
Energy Management Systems). The main goal of Annex XVII was to
analyse and to develop methodologies and tools that could be used
to evaluate 'building energy management systems' (BEMS). One of
the Annex XVII activities consisted of utilizing procedures of
numerical simulation to evaluate the control strategies usually
implemented in BEMS. The main concern was not only the potential
energy savings, but also thermo-igrometric comfort performances
of HVAC systems. The system chosen for the simulation exercises
dealing with conditioning applications was the 'Collins building'.
It is a multistorey commercial building in Glasgow, Scotland,
that was already analysed and simulated during previous IEA research
projects (Annex IV and Annex X). The simulation activity started
with common exercises (ex. 1,2) aimed at defining a reference
case and testing existing simulation codes. This activity continued
with diversified exercises (ex. 3,4) aimed at the implementation
and evaluation of different control strategies. Most of the participant
countries used TRNSYS code to run the simulation exercises. For
this reason, a reference library of TRNSYS subroutines (TRNSYS
types) and a reference input file (TRNSYS deck) were developed.
The report is divided into three sections: The first section contains
a synthesis of the last common simulation exercise (Ex. 2). The
second section contains some synthesis reports on case studies
developed by different participants. The third section contains
the listings of the TRNSYS deck and the TRNSYS types utilised
for the simulation exercises, contained in a separate appendix.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a three-dimensional
mathematical model to compute heat transfer within a radiantly
heated or cooled room, which then calculates the mass-averaged
room air temperature and the wall surface temperature distributions.
The radiation formulation used in the model accommodates arbitrary
placement of walls and objects within the room. The convection
model utilizes Nusselt number correlations published in the open
literature. The complete energy transfer model is validated by
comparing calculated room temperatures to temperatures measured
in a radiantly heated room. This three-dimensional model may be
applied to a building to assist the heating/cooling system design
engineer in sizing a radiant heating/cooling system. By coupling
this model with a thermal comfort model, the comfort levels throughout
the room can be easily and efficiently mapped for a given radiant
heater/cooler location. In addition, obstacles such as airplanes,
trucks, furniture, and partitions can be easily incorporated to
determine their effect on the radiant heating system performance.

forces of buoyancy of air become more pronounced for tall spaces.
Therefore, proper modeling of these interactions becomes more
crucial in the design of large enclosures. In atria, in particular,
solar and infrared radiation are important because of large-area
glazing. The boundary conditions for airflow, surface-to-surface
radiation, and building dynamics are linked by surface temperatures
that may vary in time and space. Numerical methods for the direct
coupling of computational fluid dynamics with thermal dynamics
and radiation are proposed and demonstrated at a case study building
of IEA Annex 26.

Abstract: Flow and temperature distributions in an atrium with
a tall ceiling height (H = 130m) are analyzed by means of computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and radiation simulation. The occupied region
(the space near the floor) of the atrium, which is open to a large
void space, is partially air conditioned. The effects of the flow
and temperature fields of the void space on the occupied region
are analyzed in detail. Then the effects of ventilation in the
upper space of the atrium on the temperature distribution are
examined. The analyzed void space, 130 m high, is sandwiched between
two high-rise office buildings. The west and east sides are covered
with glass walls, through which much solar heat is introduced
into the void space. In summer, only the lowest portion of the
atrium is well air-conditioned, and the rest of the space, especially
the upper part, is heated by the sunshine and becomes hot. The
atrium has open bridges at every floor to connect the two office
buildings, so the flow and temperature around these bridges are
greatly affected by the atrium air. The analysis includes solar
radiation (shortwave) simulation, radiative heat transfer (infrared)
simulation, heat conduction simulation, and airflow and temperature
distribution analysis of the atrium space (CFD analysis). Ventilating
the upper space effectively limits the temperature rise in the
upper part of the atrium to within an acceptable level. The radiation
and convection simulations clearly show the characteristics of
the flow and temperature fields of the large-scale atrium.

Abstract: Correct air diffusion and the proper quantity of conditioned
air are essential for comfortable conditions in forced-ventilation
systems. Three different kinds of air diffusion models are studied
for summer cooling conditions. These air diffusion types include
a one inlet-one outlet, a two inlet-one outlet, and a one inlet-two
outlet diffuser in an indoor environment. Evaluation of thermal
comfort is made in terms of the percentage dissatisfied(PD) and
air diffusion performance index (ADPI). A complete computed field
is presented and discussed using an air flow velocity vector,
temperature profile, and contours of PD as well as ADPI.

Abstract: This paper investigates air movements and temperature
distributions inside an office which is naturally ventilated.
An existing environmental chamber with a volume of approximately
45 m3 is used to represent an office. The outside air is supplied
into the environmental chamber through three different supply
positions on the wall. Measurements of air temperature and velocity
are carried out in the environmental chamber at different heights
and positions in the chamber. The internal wall surface temperatures
and outside air temperature are also monitored. The mean air velocity
is measured at the same points as the air temperatures using omnidirectional
anemometers. The outputs from the anemometers are fed into microcomputer;
these data are analysed for comfort using the predicted percentage
of dissatisfaction (PPD) method of Fanger's thermal comfort criterion.

Abstract: The natural ventilation by thermal buoyancy in a room
with small openings is determined by the equations for mass balance,
energy conservation, and vertical momentum for a control volume
representing the room in question and by the modified Bernoulli
equation used on the inlet and outlet in order to connect indoor
and outdoor conditions. Auxiliary equations are set up in order
to get the solution based on density difference, temperature difference,
and net heat input, respectively. The validity of the solution
is discussed in relation to temperature stratification, position
of neutral pressure plane, and orientation of the openings. Specific
topics are discussed concerning:

<LI>air velocity and ventilation capacity as affected by opening
area ratio (i.e. inlet area/outlet area),

Abstract: Vertical temperature differences tend to be great in
a large indoor space such as an atrium, and it is important to
predict variations of vertical temperature distribution in the
early stage of the design. The authors previously developed and
reported on a new simplified unsteady-state calculation model
for predicting vertical temperature distribution in a large space.
Comparisons between calculated values and the results of test
chamber experiments verified that the model can be used to make
accurate predictions for conditions of no solar radiation. In
this paper, this model is applied to predicting the vertical temperature
distribution in an existing low-rise atrium that has a skylight
and is affected by transmitted solar radiation. Detailed calculation
procedures that use the model are presented with all the boundary
conditions, and analytical simulations are carried out for the
cooling condition. Calculated values are compared with measured
results. The results of the comparison demonstrate that the calculation
model can be applied to the design of a large space. The effects
of occupied-zone cooling are also discussed and compared with
those of all-zone cooling.

Abstract: The climate in a glazed space and the energy requirement
in it are greatly affected by the outside climate, particularly
by solar radiation. When calculations are made for a glazed space,
solar radiation must therefore by treated considerably more fully
than for a conventional building with windows of normal size.
In order that the proportion of solar radiation utilized in different
types of glazed spaces may be assessed, calculations have been
made with the computer program DEROB-LTH. The calculations demonstrate
that the type of glazing, the transmissivity of the glass, and
the absorptivity of the surfaces inside the glazed space (i.e..
the dark and light surfaces) have a great significance for the
proportion of transmitted solar radiation retained inside the
glazed space. On the other hand, the geographical location of
the glazed space in Sweden, its orientation, and the time of year
are of less importance. The proportion of transmitted solar radiation
retained in the glazed space may vary between about 30% and 90%.
A simple manual calculation method has been developed for the
assessment of the temperature and energy requirement in glazed
spaces. The effect of the glazed space on the energy requirements
of surrounding buildings can also be estimated. It is intended
that this calculation method be used as early as possible during
the preliminary design stage so that an idea may be gained of
the difference between alternative designs.

Abstract: This paper presents the combination of a linear temperature
stratification model and the use of ISO 7730 for calculating thermal
comfort. Measurements have shown that close to linear temperature
profiles are common in atria, mainly due to large hot and cold
surfaces. the presented stratification model is integrated into
a dynamic single-zone energy simulation program. Based on the
stratified air temperature and calculated surface temperatures
of an atrium, thermal comfort is calculated for five location.
Results are presented as hourly and accumulated curves, and hourly
data are compared to measurements. The simulations show some deviations
from measured values, as expected for the simplified approaches,
and the results are analyzed to locate the main sources of errors.
In spite of the less accurate results, tools like this are of
great value in design and retrofit processes because of their
wide availability and simple use. When used carefully, expensive
redesign may be avoided at an early stage.

Abstract: This paper describes a general principle for accurate
calculation of the effect of shading objects on surfaces exposed
to direct solar radiation. The principle used is known as 'polygon
clipping', a technique for determining every subpolygon that arises
when two or more polygons overlap one another. In this case, the
obstructing objects are approximated by polygons in space, projected
as seen from the sun, at any given time of the year, onto the
exposed surface of interest, so that every sunlit region and the
fully or partly shaded regions of the plane surface can be determined.
The technique has been implemented in a PC software application,
which can function as a stand-along design tool or may be integrated
with programs for thermal simulation of buildings or solar systems.
The paper gives examples of the use of application, shows its
functionality when integrated with a thermal simulation tool,
and presents comparative validations against the standard ASHRAE
algorithms for calculations of overhangs and side fins.

Abstract: This paper highlights the factors that should be considered
when applying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to atrium design,
and gives practical recommendations on how to achieve accurate
results. CFD is an ideal tool for indoor airflow prediction, and
so can play an important role in energy-conscious heating, ventilating,
and air-conditioning (HVAC) design. Solar radiation and heat loss
or gain through the glazed envelope of an atrium have a major
bearing on the quality of the indoor environment. The paper therefore
focuses on these aspects of atrium modeling. It first reviews
established CFD methods of relevance to atrium design, such as
using CFD results to evaluate thermal comfort and ventilation
efficiency, and modeling boundary conditions for flow and heat
transfer. Further, new results are presented from the authors'
investigations into different ways of modeling solar radiation,
ways of defining boundary conditions for wall heat transfer, the
effect of near wall grid resolution, and the effect of including
surface-to-surface radiation exchange. A CFD code with a conventional
k-e turbulence model was used in the study.
