FROM THE DESK OF GEOFFREY BELL

"The main excitement at the London summit naturally centered on
President Gorbachev's visit and his economic plans.  Beneath the cordial
public reception, a vigorous debate raged behind the scenes over how far
the West should go in offering financial assistance, with the US and
Japan taking the hardline position.  The end result will be some increase
in technical assistance and a modest relaxation of restrictions on EBRD
lending to the USSR.

"At the same time, and with considerable fanfare, the USSR has been
granted `special association' with the IMF and World Bank.  The original
idea, floated at the G7 finance ministers' meeting in London, was to
make the Soviet Union an `associate member' of the Bretton Woods
institutions -- but since the multilaterals' statutes currently have no such
membership classification, `special association' has been substituted for
`associate member' status.  The end result is the same: Moscow will
supply the multilaterals with economic statistics, the IMF can examine
USSR economic performance in Article IV-type consultations, and the
USSR is eligible for technical assistance in reforming its economy.

"But the new Soviet linkage with the multilaterals does not entail new
financial commitments from Washington.  Moscow will have no quota
at the IMF, nor is the World Bank expected to finance major projects in
the Soviet Union.  Put another way, there is less to `associate status' than
meets the eye, and surely no substitute for the broader benefits of full
membership -- which is still some distance off.

"The dollar behaved impeccably for the G7 summit, with the massive
coordinated central bank intervention on July 12 successful in keeping
the currency slightly below the DM1.80  level throughout the meetings.
While the dollar is still vulnerable to a near-term correction, however,
our surveys indicate a heavy majority of market participants feel that the
general trend for the dollar remains upward.  That conviction has been
reinforced by Fed Chairman Greenspan's decidedly upbeat economic
review in congressional testimony this week, where he predicted growth
ranging from 2 1/4-3% in 1992 and steady progress in bringing down
inflation.

"While few economists now challenge the administration's contention
that the recession has ended, serious questions linger over the strength
of the economy.  Greenspan may well be correct about growth next year,
but the current air of caution in the consumer and business sectors
suggests his optimistic forecast could prove a bit on the high side.  The
chairman's view did gain support this week from report of a June
housing starts rise of 5.2%, surpassing the 1 million annualized rate for
the first time since November 1990.  In response, bond yields have
backed up slightly, with the long bond yielding just under 8.5%.

"We have been emphasizing the inevitability of US bank consolidation
for some time, so the only surprise in the Chemical/Manufacturers
Hanover marriage announced on July 15 is that it happened sooner than
many analysts expected.  This first money center merger, along with the
proposed NCNB-C&S/Sovran coupling, is likely to trigger a series of
similar consolidations.  Bankers have shown a consistent pattern of
rushing in the same direction -- whether the fad be LDC loans, highly
leveraged transactions or globalization and securitization -- and the
merger movement is likely to be no different.  Bank stocks have
immediately moved up, and investment houses are eager for the action
given the paucity of new business elsewhere.

"One area of banking where activity is growing fast is the funding of
Third World debt.  Prices have been rising very sharply, and bankers
anxious to sell their loans are finding willing new buyers in trading
rooms and among portfolio managers looking for high-yield paper.  It is
no exaggeration to argue that the Latin American debt crisis is nearing
an end: Indeed, the value of bank loans in the secondary market already
equals or exceeds the written-down value in the books of many banks."

Coming Down from the Summit

THE LONDON SUMMIT was historic by virtue of Soviet President
Gorbachev's presence and the synchronized announcement of the
conclusion of the START negotiations.  But the focus on Gorbachev
pushed a diverse range of other important economic and diplomatic
issues to the background, and that raises serious questions about summit
reform.

The bare bones of the deal with Gorbachev were widely anticipated:
"special association" with the IMF and the World Bank and commitments
to provide technical advice in specific sectors, notably energy and food
distribution.  The promises of additional assistance from the OECD and
the EBRD do not amount to much.  More significant was the proposed
help with retooling military factories for civilian use, which doubtless did
not go unnoticed by the hardliners in Moscow.  In the end, Gorbachev
emerged with only modest Western commitments to expand financial
assistance, sweetened with lavish praise and an invitation to the 1992
summit.  The latter has been widely interpreted as a first step toward a
G8 -- but in fact, it is little more than a symbolic gesture aimed at
shoring up the Soviet president's political position at home.

Aside from the Soviet question, G7 leaders offered a semblance of
movement on several issues, including a reaffirmed commitment to
control arms sales and arrest the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.  Participants also gave an endorsement to renewed efforts to
achieve a negotiated peace settlement in the Middle East, and established
a yearend deadline for conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT
negotiations.  It remains doubtful, however, whether G7 goals on arms
control and Mideast policy can be realized -- and the consensus on the
general need for a GATT accord does nothing to resolve the sticky issues
that frustrated attempts to meet the original deadline for conclusion of the
Uruguay Round at end-1990.

Perhaps more notable is what the summit participants scarcely discussed
at all.  Environmental issues got a scant 15 minutes of public discussion,
and the tour d'horizon in the final communique reappeared virtually
verbatim the Houston summit positions on secondary issues ranging from
drug trafficking to aid to Africa.  In effect, the agenda was hijacked by
the Soviet question -- and the gradual erosion in substance, continuity
and focus at annual G7 summits over the past decade has continued.

What should be done?  A Group of Thirty report released last week put
forward three practical recommendations:

* Set a new core agenda for future summits alongside a topical agenda
of items like aid for the Soviet Union.  The core should comprise five
broad topics -- aid, trade and investment, economics (macro and
structural adjustment), defense and the environment.

* Define, manage and monitor sharing of responsibility on core agenda
issues in a systematic and comprehensive manner.  That would require
G7 leaders to agree on performance measures for their own countries,
which would then be used to frame the discussion of burden-sharing and
tradeoffs in different areas of the G30 process.

* Improve arrangements for follow-through on summit decisions.  One
possibility would be to emulate the European Council of Ministers, with
heads of state meeting twice a year and periodic ministerial consultations
beyond finance to other areas such as agriculture and trade.  Broader
ministerial representation at the leadership summits could also assure
more comprehensive discussion of policy coordination in specific areas.

On balance, the London summit avoided the appearance of failure, but
it failed to deal effectively with the pressing international issues that
threaten to destabilize the world order.  If progress on GATT is achieved
and if the Soviet Union can somehow be extricated from its present
political and economic morass, the summit may have served sufficient
purpose.  But the prospect of new frustrations looms large on both fronts
-- and something more than pageantry may be required when G7 leaders
meet again.

Chemical/Manny Hanny: Let the Mergers Begin

THE MONEY CENTER MERGER long rumored finally took its first
step toward consummation this week -- and more such consolidation
moves in the US banking industry are imminent.  Once the merger of
Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover is carried out -- there seems scant
chance regulators will object, though it represents a major setback for
New York City employment and municipal revenues -- the new Chemical
Banking Corp. will have assets of US$135.5 billion, second only to
Citicorp with US$216.9 billion.  That puts more pressure on fourth-place
Chase Manhattan, fast sliding down the US asset league table with
US$98.1 billion, to shop around.  Others will have to consider mergers
just to remain cost-competitive, particularly those with large branch
networks in crowded banking markets.

Some analysts see Chase linking up with the Bank of New York, a
US$39.44 billion institution, though BNY is still working through the
aftereffects of its 1988 merger/takeover of Irving Trust.  There are
multiple consolidation possibilities on the West Coast, even if
deterioration of California and other Pacific real estate markets and bank
credit quality may delay action until the worst loans are shaken out.
Executives from Wells Fargo and Security Pacific held exploratory talks
last year; they may be taking a second look.  Another widely touted
match would merge First Interstate of Los Angeles into the well-
capitalized and aggressively expanding BankAmerica of San Francisco.
In the South, NCNB and C&S/Sovran were already talking merger as a
combined US$116.6 billion regional power when this week's news
broke, and high-performance Wachovia and South Carolina National
Bank recently tied a definitive knot.  In the Midwest, some see the
possibility of a merger between First Chicago and Continental Bank --
the latter just shaking off the lingering effects of its 1984 liquidity crisis
and rescue by the FDIC.

The Chemical/Manny Hanny merger is encouraging because it indicates
that, in the upper reaches of the US industry, realism is prevailing over
issues of institutional prestige and executive ego.  Put another way, post-
consolidation yearly cost savings of US$650 million were simply too
great to be overlooked at a time of diminished earnings prospects.  IR
has long argued that the US industry is weakened by its fragmentation
into an excessive number of institutions, with much of the excess
capacity to be found in the New York money center.  Together,
Chemical and Manufacturers have 562 branches in New York and the
surrounding region -- 133 in Manhattan alone.  Seventy branches will be
eliminated, contributing in significant part to the overall savings as at
least 6,200 jobs from a combined total of 45,000 are eliminated.  That's
a tough blow to New York, whose job pool and revenues had already
taken a major hit as the financial industry dramatically contracted.  But
as bankers prepare to cope with pending legislation in Congress that
would lock undercapitalized institutions out of expanded business areas,
they are likely to give local political considerations considerably less
weight.

Another important implication of the Chemical/Manny Hanny deal is the
new lease on life it has given bank stocks, whose first-half rebound was
in danger of petering out.  Shares of both banking concerns posted large
gains on the news, pulling up other banking issues.  Investors see a wave
of consolidations boosting profits, though it won't be easy to find many
pairs of institutions that dovetail so nicely (and with such compatible
chairmen) as Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover.  But most banks
stand to realize some savings through consolidation, and as their rivals
merge, they may have little choice but to follow suit.  In New England,
Fleet/Norstar's spring acquisition of the failed Bank of New England's
three main units already has raised pressure on the reorganizing Bank of
Boston to join forces with Shawmut National in neighboring Connecticut.

The misfortune for the longer-term development of the industry,
especially in an international context, is that there is little immediate
incentive for mergers of banks in different US markets.  The FDIC's
rejection earlier this year of BankAmerica's strong bid for the BNE units
was shortsighted in this regard because it prevented the creation of the
first major bicoastal institution.  BankAmerica may yet acquire a
subsidiary outside its region, but there are few others inclined to do so
at present.  For now, the main impulse will be consolidation within
regions and in contiguous regions, in anticipation of a US banking
reform bill likely to liberalize branching across state lines.  At some later
date, with the current bank crisis and real estate recession waning, we
may see truly national banks created by a second wave of East-West and
North-South mergers.

Myth and Reality at BCCI

THE MAIN MYTH about BCCI -- which no one has challenged -- is
that it was founded by a Pakistani banker, Agha Hassan Abedi, with Gulf
Arab money.  The truth is that it was founded by Bank of America,
which at the time was trying to build up its presence in the Middle East
and had just failed in an attempt to put together a consortium bank with
Saudi Arabia's NCB and Iran's Bank Saderat.  BoA brought in Abedi,
who had been in Beirut, to head a management team that he ran before
UBP's East Pakistan empire died with the birth of Bangladesh.  That's
no big deal: Lots of Western banks were promoting Middle East banks,
and Abedi very quickly seems to have taken over the show.  But it does
serve to emphasize the layers of obfuscation that now cloud the BCCI
affair.

We put little credence in the rumors that BCCI ran a hit squad in the US
that "eliminated" hostile witnesses, and that BCCI had made direct
payments to several former world leaders.  And the story that a recent
warehouse fire in London destroyed all or a good part of the BCCI
papers taken away from the bank by the SFO and the liquidators at the
time of its closure sounds more like James Bond fiction -- at least, we
hope it is.  More plausible is the story that BCCI paid its non-executive
directors US$200,000 a year -- wildly out of line with standard
compensation for such posts.  And what about the link between London's
highbrow but troubled Cromwell Hospital (favorite of Arab clients for
years) and BCCI?  It seems the original ownership came from BCCI
senior management, and the funding came from the bank as well.  The
relationship is well worth a look, particularly in light of some of the
shenanigans uncovered at the hospital in recent years.

A particularly intriguing published report buried in the BCCI news was
a report from Abu Dhabi suggesting that the second set of books, which
documented the years of fraud, had been located in the UAE.  That just
happens to be where Abedi's No. 2, the mysterious Mr. Naqvi, is
reputed to be now (in fact, we suspect Naqvi is more likely in Pakistan
with his erstwhile boss).

Whatever the case, the report serves to focus attention on just what the
fraud in question was.  Given the secrecy attached to the various Price
Waterhouse reports -- as many as 10, of which those of last October and
this June were most important -- the answer to this critical question is not
clear, though presumably Leigh-Pemberton has finally told the sheikh.
But we see three separate problems:

* a shuffling of assets from low- to high-regulation jurisdictions
whenever a bit of window dressing was necessary to pull the wool over
the bureaucrats of the bank's "college" of regulators -- something that we
are assured has been known in its entirety to the BoE and PW for at least
two years;

* the non-recording of deposits, probably to assist clients in avoiding
VAT and corporate taxes, primarily in the UK -- which inevitably led to
a dual booking system (and which was also, we are told, well known to
the BoE; and

* a very dodgy loan book, including unsecured or inadequately secured
loans to insiders, influential Gulf families, Pakistani shipping interests
and apparently fictitious names.

The official BoE position seems to be that, while BCCI was thought
merely to have a solvency problem, doing a deal with Sheikh Zayed to
pour more money in was acceptable.  But as soon as there was
irrefutable evidence of fraud, that deal had to be dumped and the bank
closed -- no matter that Sheikh Zayed feels he was duped or that 1.5
million depositors worldwide may have lost their money.
The problem is that there are so many holes in this argument that one
scarcely knows where to begin.  First, contrary to the BoE's official
interpretation, the 1987 Banking Act does not need proof of fraud before
a bank is closed -- just strong evidence that it is in trouble.  There was
nothing to stop the BoE from acting earlier if it had wanted. (And under
the act, neither it nor its agents can be sued except in the most dire
circumstances.)  Second, we know for a fact that the BoE had plenty of
evidence on at least the first of the three frauds as early as mid-1988, so
it could have acted then.  And don't forget that it has had its own
management, seconded from Lloyds Bank, in place since early this year.
Third, given that the Urdu mafia around Abedi had been cleaned out last
year, there is no reason to believe that the fraud situation at BCCI was
actually getting worse in 1991 -- indeed, everything we hear suggests it
was getting better.

So why did the BoE act?  One suggestion is that Leigh-Pemberton did
not appreciate the consequences, but that is too insulting to accept.  Less
incredible is the possibility that Luxembourg didn't know what might
happen, and that it pushed the button first.  Or maybe the US regulators
(or FBI) prompted action.  Our own suspicion is that the initiative came
from Price Waterhouse, whose position in the whole affair is both crucial
and equivocal.

PW audited half of BCCI even before 1987, when it was awarded a
worldwide contract at the behest of the BoE (and apparently at a fee of
around STG1 million a year).  In the last two years, it has done around
10 supplemental reports for the BoE, the last two of which (and perhaps
others) have contained evidence of fraud sufficient for the authorities to
shut the bank down.  Prior to the 1990 accounts (which are still
unpublished), however, PW did not choose to qualify its approval, except
in ways that few professionals would have spotted.  In the last 18
months, poor Sheikh Zayed -- who is utterly blameless in this -- poured
about US$2 billion into BCCI as the Pakistanis got out with their loot.

Now, the auditor (in the US and the UK) works for the shareholder --
not the regulators and not the depositors.  So, PW might well have asked
itself, should it tell Sheikh Zayed what it is finding in its investigations
for the BoE, since those findings mean that it will be unable to approve
the accounts and since they will almost certainly force the authorities to
close BCCI?  In particular, shouldn't PW have told Sheikh Zayed enough
to stop him pouring money into the bank that he is most unlikely to get
back?  Clearly, PW was in a difficult situation -- but it is significant that,
two days before the bank was closed and after the June 27 date on which
PW handed over its final report to the BoE, Sheikh Zayed pumped
another US$660 million into BCCI.  One can well imagine near-panic at
PW: After all, they, the auditors, were at that point unequivocally in
possession of information that would render that capital injection
worthless in the very near future.  Might PW not have said to the Bank,
"Act, or we will go public"?

Certainly, PW does not emerge covered in glory.  It appears to have
gotten itself in a dreadful pickle between its twin responsibilities: to the
shareholders in the normal course of (very lucrative) audit business, and
to the BoE in the course of special studies that directly impinged on the
audit side.  Maybe it was wrong of the Bank to entrust the same firm
with both tasks.  But the Bank has more to answer for than that.
Whatever soothing words Leigh-Pemberton and Brian Quinn gave to the
Gulf rulers, the fact is that the BoE effectively allowed Sheikh Zayed to
pour huge amounts of good money after bad, knowing all the while that
a closure was almost inevitable whatever pledge might have been made.
That's shoddy treatment, at best.

A Not-so-precious Metal?

THE FACT that gold funds in the US turned in an impressive 8.04%
gain in the second quarter has bolstered optimism that the market has
turned the corner.  But what we find more intriguing is the shift in
emphasis -- notably in Kathryn Welling's thoughtful analysis in this
week's Barron's, which predicts improved prices in the second half --
to define gold increasingly as little more than a commodity subject to
forces no different than those that apply to copper and wheat.

Traditionalists would doubtless argue that recent political change in South
Africa and the lifting of US sanctions have also had a positive impact,
and there is surely some truth in that.  But Welling's analysis still points
up a fundamental change from the gold bug arguments common during
the last runup of prices from 1976-79.  Traditional reasons to buy gold
were to hedge against rising inflation and consequent loss of value in
paper currency, reinforced by the more extreme scenario of a sharp
depreciation of other assets as a result of major political disturbances.
But Welling puts the case for a new price rise in more basic terms:
Demand for gold, especially for jewelry, continues to rise, and supply
cannot keep pace given the high marginal costs of expanded production.

An IR editor who addressed a congregation of gold bugs in the 1970s
recalls the hoots of derision that greeted a lonely heretic who ventured
to note that surging prices might depress jewelry demand.  At the time,
this area of the market was considered trivial compared with the
apparently inexhaustible demand for gold for financial purposes.  Now
the outlook is different: In 1989, jewelry demand for gold overtook
Western mine production, and the gap widened last year.  Evidently the
industry has taken notice: The World Gold Council is a primary sponsor
for a current exhibit of rare African gold jewelry at the Chicago Art
Institute.

So why has gold become a commodity?  The reason is that it's now
widely realized that paper money can have value when issued by a
central bank that keeps the money supply under tight control.  This
perception differs fundamentally from the traditional view that paper
money (including bank deposits) can never have ultimate value unless it
is redeemable in gold.  In fact, investors have shown no reluctance to
hold dollars, DM or other hard currencies because it is universally
recognized that central banks in the key industrialized countries will act
responsibly to control money supply.  Hard lessons from inflationary
experience have definitively refuted any "greenback" theories that
governments can simply print unlimited amounts of money without
affecting its value.

With these lessons learned, gold -- earning no interest and requiring
storage costs -- looks less attractive as an investment, save purely as a
commodity.  Even the threat of war or rising inflation is no longer
enough to set off a rush into gold -- the dollar is generally the preferred
safe haven.  Hence the Gulf crisis produced surprisingly modest
movement in the price of gold.

Today, many traders in silver look to tableware instead of coinage for
guidance on demand.  Perhaps gold bugs will be more reluctant to
undergo complete conversion -- but it's not too early to pay closer

UNITED STATES

GREENSPAN'S testimony before Congress confirms that Fed bank
president hawks in the FOMC have taken a back seat on monetary
policy.  Although Greenspan's forecast of economic growth next year in
a range of 2.25-3.0% is below the administration forecast at 3.6%, he
pointedly chose to keep present money supply targets at 2.5-6.5%.  The
anti-inflation zealots would have preferred to lower the band a notch, but
the 0.3% fall in the June PPI hardly supports their case -- and the 0.2%
CPI rise last month scarcely appears grounds for panic.

Greenspan conceded, as most corporate borrowers could confirm, that
the credit crunch persists -- and there's no guarantee that the situation
will get better in the near term.  In this context, the Chemical/Manny
Hanny marriage unveiled this week -- and the certain prospect of more
mergers to follow (see the lead editorial in this issue) -- could prolong
and conceivably even exacerbate the crunch in the short term, for two
reasons:

* parties to coming mergers will want to wash their hands of lending by
the other party that looks unwise or possibly vulnerable to regulatory
difficulties; and

* in many cases, loan officers fearful for their jobs will be inclined to sit
on their assets until they get a clearer picture of the new chain of
command and its revamped lending priorities.

The 5.2% rise in June housing starts is obviously good news, reinforcing
the anecdotal evidence that lower interest rates have given a boost to
residential construction.  But the recovery in the sector remains fragile
-- one more reason why the Fed will be cautious about raising interest
rates in the near term.  The 0.7% rise in industrial production for June
was skewed by a surge in auto and truck output, behind the 3.7% jump
in the consumer goods category.  Business equipment, excluding autos
and trucks, showed no change (remember too that some "fleet sales" of
vehicles quickly feed through to the consumer market).  Thus far, the
recovery seems to be stronger in consumer-based categories like housing
than in the business investment sector.  One gloomy projection based on
that dichotomy is that employment will show little improvement in the
near term -- and could even decline further -- though rising spending
power for workers will be sufficient to offset declining demand from the
unemployed.  The implicit risk in this scenario is that, unless
productivity picks up, lower profit margins and lower investment will be
the end result, undercutting the nascent recovery.  We do not view such
an outcome as inevitable -- but it's worth noting that a recovery driven
largely by the consumer economy threatens to exacerbate the existing
distortions caused by the relatively low savings rate of the US.  And
higher real long-term interest rates as global demand for capital
intensifies could further undercut business investment.

President Bush offered vague commitments in London to press forward
with the Uruguay Round -- but behind the reassuring rhetoric is a drift
in Washington toward the same sort of protectionism that the US is
pressing Brussels to abandon.  That suggests that the administration may
seek to use the North American FTA as a vehicle to introduce tougher
restrictions on imports from outside the proposed trading bloc.  A critical
issue is whether the new FTA will contain tougher foreign content
restrictions to prevent Japanese and European exporters and investors
from stealing under the umbrella of the trade pact.  Already US
automakers are complaining about liberal interpretations as to "national
content" in Canadian-built cars -- and we can expect such issues to be
pressed with greater urgency regarding Japanese- and European-owned
companies in Mexico.  That could lead to establishment of more uniform
tariff treatment for imports into North America -- another step down the
road toward major regional trading blocs.

TIGHTENING UP ON THE BANKS

In contrast to pending House legislation that less charitable observers
deride as a "widows, orphans and bankers relief bill," the Senate
Banking Committee draft released this week grants less new turf to the
banks and asks more in return.  Still, the "committee print" fashioned by
committee chairman Donald Riegle (D-Mich.) is consistent in key
respects with the Brady reform plan.  It includes two essential elements
of the White house proposal -- repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act separating
commercial and investment banking and authorization of interstate
branching -- albeit with provisos on both.  But the Riegle draft would not
allow ownership of banks by commercial enterprises and would continue
to bar entry by federally chartered banks into the insurance business.

Maintenance of the existing barrier to business ownership of banks could
amount to de facto continuance of Glass-Steagall, as so many securities
houses are subsidiaries of major corporations.  And the Senate bill is
much more restrictive than the House version on deposit insurance.  It
does not propose to cut back coverage of individuals from present levels,
but it would eliminate protection of brokered deposits.  The industry is
sure to mount heavy resistance as well to the provision for a special
assessment to cover the first US$10 billion pumped into the Bank
Insurance Fund.  Big banks will object in particular to the inclusion of
foreign as well as domestic deposits in the assessment base.

Some of the Riegle bill's sterner provisions may fall away in eventual
House-Senate conference talks on the final bill.  But commercial control
of banks, also vigorously opposed by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, may well be
doomed.  It is also vulnerable to the populist argument (exaggerated, but
not entirely unfounded) that letting big companies buy banks would
concentrate economic power and dramatically raise taxpayer exposure in
the event of failures.

Provisions in the draft Senate bill that would impinge on Fed and
Treasury discretion in stabilizing big banks in trouble also are likely to
be watered down.  The Riegle draft would bar the rescue of large banks
as "too big to fail," and limit discount window assistance.  In the end,
however, monetary officials are likely to be left with wide discretion
here.  Democrats in both the House and Senate may well oblige the
maintenance of provisions obliging banks to provide services to low-
income consumers.

CANADA

THE MULRONEY government is going Gramm-Rudman in a big way
--  if more for political expediency than budgetary rigor.  FM Don
Mazankowski used a visit to his home province of Alberta to announce
plans for a 3% cap on annual federal spending, with Parliament barred
from hiking taxes or authorizing new borrowings to push spending above
that limit.  The Spending Control Act would cover all federal
expenditures except debt service, and would be applied on a government-
wide basis -- which means above-target increases in entitlements such as
social welfare or unemployment benefits would have to be offset by
compensating cutbacks elsewhere in other federal departments.

It is no accident that the FM broke the news in Alberta, the hotbed of the
surging Reform Party, whose otherwise vague and unfocused rightist
platform has one clear plank -- strict controls on government
expenditures.  The Reformists are ahead of the ruling Tories in the polls
nationally and far ahead in Alberta.  Cabinet ministers like Mazankowski
and high-profile Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark may be safe,
but private polls show that other Alberta-based Tories would be wiped
out if elections were held now.

It appears doubtful whether Mazankowski's gambit can reverse the Tory
slide in the West, but odds for approval in Ottawa appear favorable --
likely before yearend.  Under the law, a five-year spending ceiling would
be set at Can$615.3 billion.  If spending projections in a given budget
exceed the yearly levels implicit in the five-year limit, the FM would be
compelled to establish how the government plans to compensate for the
overrun in future years.  Budgets that do not comply with mandated
spending limits could be approved only if Parliament rescinds the act
itself.

Gadfly Quebec businessman Glen Kealey -- well known nationwide as a
constant fixture who conducts his one-man protests almost daily outside
Parliament -- has become far more than just a nuisance to the Tory
government.  The doggedly persistent Kealey, whose rage stems from
alleged attempts by several Quebec Tories to extract bribes in exchange
for commitment of federal offices to his planned office complex across
the river from Ottawa, surprised the political cynics by persuading the
courts to bring charges of fraud and corruption against Sports Minister
Pierre Cadieux, three former ministers, the RCMP commissioner, several
senators and other Tory party officials.  Several targets of Kealey's wrath
already have been convicted on other charges; several more left the
cabinet with their political careers ruined.  The new charges will be
investigated by the local police, and some big Tory names could face
trial; Kealey first complained to the RCMP, but the federal agency found
evidence supporting the charges to be insufficient.

Economists are convinced the recession is over, but some leading
business executives fear that the economy could slip into a double-bottom
recession if the present upward momentum proves unsustainable.  For
now, the recovery scenario looks secure: Manufacturing shipments
increased by 0.9% in May to Can$23.3 billion, the third straight monthly
gain after a string of declines.  Granted, the gain was well below the 2%
rise in April, and most of the expansion was concentrated in the auto and
wood industries.  But combined with other economic indicators, it points
to an improving trend that should persuade the BoC to keep short-term
rates steady.

JAPAN

THE EFFECTS of the brokerage scandal may persist long after the
embarrassing disclosures end, and could knock the wind out of an
economy that is already looking tired.  No one is talking about an
outright recession: On the contrary, with just two months to go, the
current expansion is certain to surpass the record 57-month Izanagi boom
of the 1960s.  But most economists now doubt that real GNP will meet
the official target of 3.8% growth in the fiscal 1991 year through next
March.  The latest forecast revisions show inflation-adjusted growth of
3.0-3.5% in FY 1991.  Moreover, the likelihood that activity in Europe
--  a major customer of Japanese exports in recent quarters -- will continue
to slow suggests that the external sector may no longer offset weakness
in the domestic economy.

The immediate cause for concern is the newly foundering stock market,
which plunged to a 1991 low earlier this month and remains unsteady
over the 23,000 level.  Since Japanese banks may book unrealized profits
on equities holdings as capital, fluctuations of the Nikkei directly affect
their ability to meet the 8% capital adequacy requirement that the BIS
has set for the end of March 1993.  Last August, as the recovering
Tokyo Stock Exchange stalled and headed south again, only three of the
12 city banks had met the new standard.  However, the next phase of the
rally hatched in January pushed all but one over the threshold at the end
of FY 1990 on March 31.  At current levels, stock prices are 15% below
the 1991 peak of 27,147 on March 18.

The Ministry of Finance's largely symbolic response to the securities
scandal has done little to reassure investors or restore its flagging
credibility.  Last week, the Big Four securities houses began a
"voluntary" punishment -- a four-day suspension of soliciting business
from corporate clients.  FM Hashimoto, who previously denied
responsibility for the incident, subsequently reversed his position and
acknowledged that faulty oversight may have been a contributing factor.
The penalty: a three-month pay cut of 10% for himself (which translates
to a sum of US$30,000) and two other MoF officials.  Ironically,
Hashimoto's embarrassment may yield political dividends for PM Kaifu,
whose chances of retaining the LDP presidency and the top job in
October have thus improved.

The BIS rule and slumping TSE are squeezing banks anew and reducing
their ability to lend.  Now that equity financing is not a viable
alternative, major banks are rushing to obtain massive amounts of
subordinated loans from life insurance companies.  Sumitomo Bank, for
example, is seeking to borrow Y40-50 billion through this avenue.  At
worst, this could become a new source of pressure on stocks and crimp
corporations, which face rationing of credit needed to fund investment.

Significantly, the Bank of Japan's half-point cut in the discount rate on
July 1 was designed to refuel the economy and provide relief to the
teetering Nikkei.  Thus, the fallout from the brokerage scandal has
probably nullified the stimulative effect of lower interest rates.  Indeed,
all but two of 18 economic research institutes, which published revised
economic forecasts this week, believe that further easing of monetary
policy is required to sustain the expansion.

Warning signs are emanating from a variety of sources:
* Corporate bankruptcies: The number of first half business failures rose
for the first time in seven years by 60.2% to 4,723 in January-June 1991
from a year ago.   Combined liabilities surged 394.4% to a record
Y3,426.2 billion, surpassing the previous high reached in the first
semester of 1986.  This figure represents 82% of the full-year record
achieved in 1986, and assures that a historic high will be set for all of
1991.  Most of the increase in liabilities resulted from the collapse of
"bubble" companies that speculated heavily in equities and real estate.

* Foreign trade: The merchandise trade surplus widened in June for the
sixth consecutive month.  Measured year-on-year, the surplus grew 8.9%
to US$7.26 billion, as 6.9% growth in exports outpaced the 6.1% rise
in imports.  However, the bilateral balance with the US fell 17.9% -- a
reflection both of the relative strength of the yen and the weak US
economy.  Consequently, Japanese companies are likely to renew their
bid for American pocketbooks, which could draw new protectionist
reprisals from Washington.

The improving trade balance elsewhere carries the same political risk.
In the 12 months through June, the surplus soared 48.5% to US$2.64
billion with the EC and 20.3% to US$3.44 billion with Southeast Asian
countries.  In Europe, French PM Edith Cresson is leading the rhetorical
attack on Tokyo, while complaints are emerging from both Seoul and
Taiwan.  Thus, researchers at LTCB expect the current account surplus
to expand sharply from US$33.8 billion in FY 1990 to US$58.6 billion
this year, but to contract by 9% in FY 1992 in line with the shrinking
trade surplus.

* Monetary growth: The key M2+CDs measure rose a modest 3.5% in
May from a year ago, down nearly 10 percentage points from the peak
rate of 13% in the first quarter of 1990.  The BoJ insists that this pace
is sufficient to sustain economic activity, and expects the money supply
to show a 4% increase in April-June -- we have our doubts.

* Business investment: A new Small Business Credit Insurance Corp.
survey reveals that planned plant and equipment spending by small and
medium-size companies will drop 6.8% in the current fiscal year amid
increasing caution about the economic outlook.  Asahi Mutual expects
overall capital spending to grow just 1.1% in January-June 1991 from
the previous half year, and by a relatively modest 2.2% in July-
December.

The BoJ's 25-month regimen of tight credit will continue to reduce
inflation pressures.  Overall wholesale prices fell 0.1% in June from
May and rose an enviable 0.6% from a year earlier; since 1985, the WPI
has fallen 9%.  LTCB economists foresee no more than 1% wholesale
inflation and 2% retail inflation in the latter half of FY 1991 on the basis
of stable crude oil prices and moderate wage growth.  Taken together,
anemic activity, restrained growth in prices and the money supply and
a foundering stock market increase the prospects for another cut in the
official discount rate, currently 5.5%, by the end of September.

GERMANY

THE DECISION of the Bundesbank to lower the target for monetary
aggregate growth has blown the cover on the attempt in Frankfurt and
Bonn to play down the deepening rift over monetary policy.  The
decision to lower the top end of the money supply band to 5% is a direct
response to the failure of FM Theo Waigel and Economy Minister
Juergen Moellemann to make headway on subsidy and other spending
cuts.  IR sources say the only reason the Bundesbank chose not to hike
rates last week is that it didn't want to embarrass Waigel on the eve of
the London summit, where a German rate hike would have been
enormously unpopular -- though it seems eminently plausible that the
massive coordinated CB intervention in support of the DM one day after
the Bundesbank meeting was the quid pro quo for standing pat.

Market sources in Frankfurt anticipate an upward bias in interest rates
to the end of the summer.  The central concern at the Bundesbank
remains the budget: BB analysts dismiss Finance Ministry claims that the
federal share of PSBR will fall by 50% to DM25 billion in 1995 as
irrelevant, and forecast total new public debt will reach at least DM160
billion by that year.  That's not counting "shadow budgets" and other
hidden outlays taken off budget, notably the Treuhand and Hermes-
backed credit lines to the USSR.

Schlesinger's immediate concerns are twofold:

* FX reserves at the BB have fallen by DM10 billion thus far in 1991,
narrowing the margin of comfort for future intervention.  The
coordinated July 12 operation proved a huge success -- but Schlesinger
is well aware that such broad support, particularly from the Fed, cannot
be counted on if the DM comes under renewed pressure.

* The June inflation numbers were bad enough, and Schlesinger fears the
July results could be worse -- albeit largely due to the one-off impact of
the tax increases that took effect July 1.

Heightened pressure on the FX and inflation fronts would significantly
narrow the odds for a Bundesbank rate hike, regardless of Bonn's desire
to hold off.  And rising interest rates would also intensify pressure on
Waigel to consider new fiscal actions.  Wilhelm Noelling of the
Hamburg LZB already is publicly touting hefty taxes on real estate
holdings and capital assets as the only effective means to transfer wealth
from west Germany to the ex-GDR.  Noelling's view is still tainted by
association with the Hamburg SPD's weakness for giveaways to the East
-- but the endorsement of several economic institutes has broadened the
political base of support for new fiscal actions.  Any movement in that
direction, however, clashes head-on with the palpable unpopularity in the
West of the tax rises already in place -- and it's impossible to conceive
of Bonn implementing fiscal adjustments that could prevent the PSBR
from moving steadily higher.

Further repercussions of the Karlsruhe decision. Tax lawyers who have
seen the 60-page Supreme Court verdict call the decision a landmark
victory for fiscal authorities -- and a stinging defeat for rights to privacy
in banking transactions.  In the political arena, the ruling CDU is
inclined to opt for spot tax audits as the most efficient -- and least
financially damaging -- response to the court ruling.  It also appears to
favor a deductible limit of DM2,000 for interest income.  But neither the
party nor the government thus far has provided sufficient clarification of
its position on the Karlsruhe ruling, and that alone could unsettle
investors.  The opposition SPD has taken advantage of the confusion by
spelling out a more clear-cut policy that rules out reintroduction of
withholding tax on interest income, establishes higher deduction limits
for small investors, and calls for aggressive efforts to assure greater
conformity in tax laws throughout the EC.  The SPD also would favor
spot audits over more sweeping tax controls.

Banks will be forced to relax secrecy requirements, but will seek Bonn's
commitment to broaden exemptions for interest income on the (somewhat
self-serving) grounds that lower taxes would make voluntary controls
more workable.  Specifically, the industry will lobby for much bigger tax
exemptions up to DM6,000 for single and DM12,000 for joint returns.
The trouble is that the standard tax deduction for wages currently is set
at just DM2,000 -- and it will be difficult to make a case for giving
preferential treatment to interest income.  Also expect the small banks --
without links to Luxembourg or offshore subsidiaries -- to press for
uniformity in rules for interest taxation throughout the EC, which
Deutsche, Commerzbank and Dresdner are more likely to oppose to
protect their interests abroad.

THE MERTENS AFFAIR

Two weeks after allegations of insider trading abuses in the newsletter
Effecten-Spiegel triggered action at Deutsche Bank against a key figure
in the case, the affair is burgeoning.  Prosecutors are now investigating
Thomas Fluegel, a crony of Manfred Mertens, the DB securities official
sacked for violating "internal regulations" of the bank.  Prosecutors have
raided Fluegel's office and are now sifting through documents for
evidence to support allegations that Mertens was embezzling from his
employer -- purportedly by skimming payments for securities deals that
turned a profit, while chalking up losses to DB.  IR sources also report
that Deutsche is restructuring its securities trading operations to prevent
its employees from conducting one-man operations at its expense.

The latest twist is part of an increasingly tangled web of allegations.
Fluegel was a former employee of the Frankfurt securities trader
Ohms/Schmidt, until Schmidt and Fluegel quit and joined forces.  Ohms,
not touched in the most recent affair, was the former employer of
Joachim Schmidt, the securities trader who gained notoriety in the VW
securities scandal.  A report in the business magazine Wirtschaftswoche
claims that Poehl's former secretary, who was fired after allegedly
providing Schmidt with information about dollar interventions, was later
hired by Ohms.

UNITED KINGDOM

The half-point cut in interest rates, courtesy of the Bundesbank, came on
schedule.  And the enthusiasm of the markets may convince Chancellor
Lamont to go for another half-point cut before the new Schlesinger-era
Bundesbank Council reconvenes at the beginning of September.  The
FTSE has surged, the gilts market has suspended disbelief, and
economists like Gavyn Davies (whose ideological bent is to the left) are
saying that there is finally light at the end of the tunnel.

But hold on.  For once, we side with the CBI, whose latest
pronouncement is that "brutal" anti-inflation policies (strongly supported
at the time by the CBI) have set back growth prospects for years.  We
don't see any sign of the recession ending: Indeed, in some key sectors,
the other shoe is still to fall.  The most vulnerable is property: the
Stanhope/Rosehaugh merger is a sign of weakness, not recovery.  In
central London, 15% of office space supply is now unoccupied, and
empty office space in the capital has increased by 6.2 million square feet
in the last six months alone.  Plus, there is still a huge amount of new
building about to come on the market -- with no realistic chance of
finding tenants.  Whether base rates are 11% or 11.5% is irrelevant to
the plight of these developers: Another half-point cut won't stop some
very nasty collapses.

And the banks stand to suffer from the property fallout.  The
conventional wisdom is that the clearers are in for a bonanza -- after five
years of retrenchment, it is felt, they are leaner and more bottom-line
oriented.  As the economy recovers, it is argued, bank profits will soar.
Well, maybe -- but only because bank accounting is exceptionally
creative and they are going to have to raise capital for Basel.  The truth
is that all the clearers are sitting on real estate loans that are
nonperforming, underperforming or outright worthless -- and they will
have to take the hit sometime.  Lamont's anticipated report exonerating
the clearers from operating a cartel to the detriment of small business
could well reinforce the feel-good tendency among the banks -- but in
our view, the optimism is premature.

As for gilts, the message seems to be that, despite the expectation of
higher growth, inflationary expectations are falling even faster -- and
gilts are, therefore, a solid bet.  But note that the markets are looking
very selectively at the price data: The fact is that retail prices are stuck
at 5.8% and that core output inflation is running at 6%.  And forecasts
of 3.5% by Christmas, despite a pickup in growth, are wildly optimistic.
Plus, the improvement in the June PSBR to "only" STG1.41 billion,
from STG3.52 billion in May, is a one-off improvement: Had it not been
for receipts from the Scottish power selloff, the amount would have been
almost STG2.6 billion.  Given the doubts about the government's ability
to sell off the residue of BT as it had expected in the autumn, the PSBR
for FY 1991-92, which is slated at STG8 billion, could well come in at
closer to STG12-13 billion -- and that will offset even a substantial
improvement in inflation.

Finally two pointers:

* Barclays's new ECU issue of subordinated notes (a private placement
to Asian investors) will be the first of several such calls as clearers look
for capital to meet Basel ratios.  The ECU market is underdeveloped for
UK institutions, and there is real potential there.

* The front-runner to succeed Robin Leigh-Pemberton, whose stock has
taken a tumble as a result of BCCI, is SIB's David Walker.  As an
outsider, he has remained untainted by the BCCI affair -- unlike Eddie
George, who might normally get the nod.  As a former insider, he would
be better able to clean house under a Labour government than someone
like David Scholey.  Plus, he is a genuinely impressive intellect.

MIDLAND IN MOSCOW

The Financial Times investigation into the activities of a Midland Bank
trade subsidiary in the arms business, and the revelation of its links to
the world of British spookery -- not to mention losses close to STG100
million over 10 years -- is yet another bizarre banking story that could
run and run.  Moreover, the emerging evidence indicates close traditional
links between boardrooms at a number of clearing banks (and one or two
merchant banks) and the intelligence community, though Midland may
be the only one to have had its senior staff commit "suicide" in Moscow.
What must have present managements worried is just how easy it seems
to have been to lose MITS within the Midland organizational structure:
Kit McMahon is no fool, but it took him at least a couple of years to
identify a division that was apparently losing money like Bank of New
England.  A couple of questions to the auditor might not be amiss: What
are they paid for, after all?

GOVERNMENT FOR SALE

Transatlantic observers begin by accepting the British picture of
themselves as squeaky-clean, which only heightens their incredulity when
the venality of British politics and business is exposed to view.  A good
case in point is the decision by British Airways' boss, Lord King, to
withhold his company's regular STG40,000 contribution to the Tory
party because the DTI and Department of Transport have decided to open
up BA's cozy near-monopoly of long-haul routes out of Heathrow to
competition -- particularly from Virgin's Richard Branson.  In the US,
this kind of corporate donation  goes through a PAC and is decently (if
ingenuously) clothed in some sort of ideological garb -- free markets, fair
trade, Japan-bashing, whatever.  In the UK, it is right up front -- hence
King's decision.  What is more outrageous is that, by and large, the
British press has applauded King for his frankness -- but then the press
has a pretty relaxed view of its perks, too.

CRIME PAYS

Latest evidence that the UK courts are hopelessly naive comes from the
decision just handed down against the four principals in the Garton
Amhurst case, who got between 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 years in jail for fleecing
clients quite shamelessly of at least STG4.7 million over 10 years.  The
four, who were barely in their 20s when the scam started, will do 12-24
months with good behavior -- and will then have to forego the pleasures
of being a company director for another couple of years.  Most
outrageous, the judge accepted that they had salted nothing away for this
kind of rainy day, and hence made no restitution order against them.
That seems more like Colombian than English justice.

SWITZERLAND

EXPECTATIONS that inflation will remain stubbornly high through the
summer -- with the year-on-year index climbing in June to its highest
level in nearly a decade, at 6.6% -- have dampened investor interest in
the SF bond market.  The falloff in new issues as the summer break
begins also has hurt the market.  Current prices already discount an
anticipated fall in inflation to 4.5% by yearend, and leading analysts at
Swiss banks expect SF bond yields to hold near present levels to
yearend.

The consensus among Zurich bankers is that investors would do better
to move now to lengthen maturity profiles in SF fixed-income portfolios
-- those who wait could find supply short when the market takes a more
dramatic upturn.  From a technical perspective, another good play in
Zuerich at present is Japanese equity warrants, currently recommended
by CS director Pierre Andre Chappallaz.  In recent weeks, warrant
values have declined from a 20% to 14% premium, which has made this
sector competitive with other currency warrants.  Chappallaz warns,
however, that persistent political uncertainty in Japan could lead to
further depreciation in value.

Bank Vontobel also is advising investors to reduce liquidity in all
currencies.  Jean-Pierre Rothenbuehler, head of the bank's advisory
department for private clients, views DM investments as likely to remain
the most solid in Europe, but prefers Euro-DM to the domestic Bund
market.  Vontobel analysts are concerned at the pall cast over the
domestic market by the recent constitutional court decision regarding
taxation of interest income.  The result could be a split in the DM bond
market, with prices falling for Bunds but rising for Euro-DM issues.

As for the Swiss stock market, currently near its 1991 high, Vontobel
anticipates little movement over the next several weeks, with the
economic slowdown and slower-than-anticipated improvement on the
inflation front already factored into pricing.  The market will regain its
upward momentum only with a significant drop in interest rates and
improved Swiss corporate earnings, bolstered by recent favorable
movements in SF exchange rates against the dollar and the yen.

A new study of prospective Swiss economic integration with Europe by
Peter Meier, chief economic analyst at Zurcher Kantonalbank, sees
significant advantage in the potentially enhanced stability that EMS
alignment could bring to the Swiss franc.  In Meier's view, full Swiss
integration in the EMS would appear a logical extension of present EC
movement toward monetary union.  But SNB Governor Markus Lusser
remains skeptical over the perceived benefits in closer SF alignment with
the EMS.  In our view, however, the SNB's dream of monetary policy
independence from Germany appears impossible to realize in the present
environment.

On interest rates, Meier foresees no fall in domestic mortgage rates at
least until Euro-SF rates begin to slide more sharply.  Three-month
Euro-SF rates, currently around 7 13/16-7 15/16%, should ease by
around half a point by yearend, but ZKB analysts view that fall as
insufficient to influence mortgage rates.

Don't expect any further substantial improvement in the Swiss trade
deficit to yearend, as softening in export sales abroad should offset an
anticipated falloff in import demand.  In the first half, the trade deficit
declined by 8% against the year-ago period to SF5 billion, while terms
of trade improved due to modest decline in import prices and modest
improvement in average export values.  Widening interest spreads
currently favor the DM -- some Swiss forecasters now anticipate a rise
to SF0.88/DM on the cross by yearend -- but the currency movement is
unlikely to have a major impact on the bilateral balance with
Switzerland's largest key trading partner.  IR expects softened German
demand as a result of the economic slowdown to weaken Swiss exports
to that country in the second half.

The Swiss economic slowdown has taken its toll on federal finances.
The Federal Financial Department in Berne, in revised projections based
on first-half tax income, predicts that the budget will finish the year in
deficit for the first time in five years.  The new forecast contrasts with
an original budget projection of a SF73 million surplus in 1991.
Estimated tax revenues of SF16.2 billion were significantly below
expectations: Direct federal tax income appears likely to come in near
anticipated levels at yearend, but turnover taxes -- the main source of
federal tax revenues -- show a substantial decline.

FRANCE

NOW THAT year-on-year inflation is lower in France than in Germany
for the first time in 18 years, FM Beregovoy sees a widening margin of
comfort to ease credit -- but he will resist political pressure for more
aggressive action.  Provisional data show the June CPI at just 0.2%, with
the year-on-year rate up by 10 bp from May to 3.3%.  But a 0.5%
monthly surge pushed the German CPI up to 3.5% year-on-year in June.
The widely anticipated reversal in the Franco-German inflation
differential is a personal victory for Beregovoy, whose tight-money,
strong-franc policies over the past three years have steadily slowed price
growth.

France should retain the inflation edge over Germany at least until the
end of the year, given expectations of stable French inflation around 3%
and persistent reconstruction pressures on German prices.  But
Beregovoy and the Bank of France are taking a cautious line on interest
rates, despite mounting political pressure to ease monetary policy to
prime the economy.  French growth was flat in the first quarter and is
expected to remain sluggish at 1.5% for all of 1991, down from 2.8%
in 1990.

The BoF's benchmark rates, the money market intervention rate and the
repurchase rate for five- to 10-day securities, have held steady at 9% and
10%, respectively, since March 18.  The rates are applied by the central
bank on its advances of liquidity to the banking system and are generally
regarded as the lower and upper limits for daily movement by short-term
market-determined rates.  The BoF's quarter-point cut of key rates last
October was quickly followed by German monetary tightening that sent
the franc into dangerous territory, briefly over FF3.4200; the BoF now
appears firmly committed to holding the line at FF3.40.

Advocates of immediate easing gained additional ammunition with the
continued fall in housing starts to the end of the first quarter.  The
downward trend is expected to continue through the summer, despite a
recent pickup in construction permits.  The volume of houses completed
in 1990 rose by just 1.6% after a rise of 5.4% in 1989, while spending
on house purchases and building improvements rose by a feeble 0.2%.
Developers reported a sharp rise in housing inventory to FF7.1 billion
in 1990, from FF2.4 billion the year before.

SABENA'S FATE

The EC Commission will decide next week whether to approve a
proposed Belgian government aid package of BF35 billion to help
restructure struggling national air carrier Sabena.  The issue is seen as
important since the EC is taking an increasingly dim view of subsidies,
and last year heavily criticized Air France and UK-based Rover for
hidden subsidy arrangements.  The Commission previously has indicated
that it would approve a Sabena bailout only if:

* it is a one-time operation, ruling out any future aid for the airline; and

* Sabena's monopoly on routes to Brussels's Zaventem international
airport is dismantled and access is granted to other airlines.

The Commission is understood to believe that the Belgian government
has gone a long way toward meeting conditions for the aid.  The package
would include a BF16.2 billion writeoff of long-term debt and would be
extended in two phases.  An initial installment of BF10 billion would be
paid immediately upon Commission approval, mainly to finance up to
3,000 layoffs.

A BREAK IN THE FARM IMPASSE?

EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry has come up with a new
plan designed to take large amounts of land out of production.  The
comprehensive reform program is designed to encourage farmers to retire
early, tempted by lump-sum payments and pension plans.  Those staying
on would face a 35% cut in the Community's guaranteed prices, a 15%
cut in support prices for beef, and a 4% cut in the EC milk quota over
the next three years.  The scheme would cost the EC budget almost
STG3 billion in compensation to farmers over three years -- but
MacSharry argues that would be modest relative to the cost of
perpetuating the present subsidy system.

SOVIET UNION

CAN THE WEST avoid paying for perestroika?  The G7 managed to
politely fend off Gorbachev's financial pleas at the London summit: The
six-point program for the future is skillfully and carefully crafted to put
the emphasis on technical assistance and macroeconomic monitoring by
the multilaterals.  But it should already be obvious that -- even if foreign
capital makes inroads in select areas such as energy, mining and
aerospace,   and  even  if  the  Soviet  Parliament  and  the  republics
adopt the necessary legal framework for development of the private
economy -- the need for more substantial financial aid will remain acute.

The key to the future of the Soviet economy -- assuming it is not ripped
apart by nationalist movements -- remains privatization.  But the
transition to a market economy will be long and difficult: Production will
continue to plummet in the interim, existing distribution patterns will be
disrupted, and living standards will slide further.

The conundrum is that Western leaders tacitly recognize Gorbachev's
great experiment -- and his government -- could come crashing down if
he cannot raise the capital abroad to finance a more ambitious and
accelerated market transformation, yet they are reluctant to make massive
financial commitments.  The G7's insistence on a more specific and
viable blueprint for reform is understandable -- but the risk is that the
transformation will be stopped dead in its tracks while the West quibbles
over the details of the program.  Sweeping Soviet capitulations on global
policy from Eastern Europe to arms control of the magnitude agreed by
Gorbachev would have been inconceivable a decade ago -- and
Gorbachev's defenders would argue that the G7 would ultimately be
doing itself a favor by more generously assisting the transition to a
capitalist economy.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA

EXPECT a reasonably good economic performance for 1991, despite
predictable setbacks in the transition to a market economy.  Like its East
European neighbors, Czechoslovakia has suffered economic damage from
lost oil imports and Mideast contracts as a result of the Gulf crisis, as
well as from disruption of trade with the Soviet Union.  But Prague has
fared better in weathering the storm -- and while FM Vacalv Klaus warns
against premature optimism, government officials express satisfaction
with the progress made toward economic stabilization thus far.

Jaromir Zahradnik, vice president of the National Bank, notes that the
koruna exchange rate has stabilized and that inflation has been brought
under control after an initial surge following price decontrol at the start
of the year.  The CPI, which surged to 26% monthly in January,
dropped below 2% in May.  Unemployment has remained moderate at
around 3% of the workforce, in contrast to much higher levels in
neighboring countries.  Prague is proceeding with careful but
fundamental reform of the banking and financial systems.  State subsidies
for unprofitable enterprises are gradually being phased out, and
bankruptcies are certain to follow.

On balance, Prague's go-slowly approach to reform appears to have
produced less economic disruption and political turmoil than Warsaw's
more sweeping strategy.  Whether that is a matter of superior economic
management is another  question -- clearly Czechoslovakia has also
benefited from the fact that its foreign debt position is the most
advantageous among all East European countries save Romania.

POLAND

WARSAW will press the IMF for new concessions in its new pact with
the multilateral to ease the country's worsening financial straits.  The
government is watching helplessly as revenues from state-owned
enterprises dwindle, and the fledgling private sector can scarcely be
expected to fill the gaping hole in the budget.  The fiscal deficit is
projected to reach US$777 million this year, with inflation expected to
hit 55%.  Goals agreed with the IMF when the US$2.5 billion three-year
assistance package was originally negotiated in April already appear
hopelessly beyond reach.  One sign of Warsaw's growing desperation is
the postponement of a US$100 million payment on interest arrears owed
to commercial bank creditors.

Poland's financial reputation will be further tarnished by the brewing
scandal at the Agency for Foreign Debt Servicing.  The agency was
established before Solidarity took power, but several of its officials,
including Vice Finance Minister Janusz Sawicki, hold important positions
in the Bielecki government.  The agency is accused of mishandling the
funds, unauthorized repurchase transactions of national debt and outright
fraud.

The IMF will not agree readily to take the pressure off Warsaw -- but
some compromise appears inevitable if credit lines to Poland are to be
preserved.  Local political observers are loath to predict when the
population's tolerance for further austerity measures will run out, but the
pessimists say the breaking point is dangerously close.

BRAZIL

MONTHLY INFLATION moved as anticipated into double digits in
June, but the rise was not so drastic as to fatally undercut confidence in
Economy Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira's economic program.
Estimates by the FIPE institute at the University of Sao Paulo show
inflation for the 30-day period to July 8 accelerated to 10.7%, and FIPE
economists expect inflation to peak around 11% before easing to 10% by
end-July.

The IMF technical mission that arrived in Brazil this week will have to
weigh the recent economic progress made under Moreira against
lingering concerns, specifically over the inflation outlook and a
deterioration in the fiscal situation after steady improvement in 1990.
The latter problem reflects a sharp reduction in government revenues,
caused by restoration of diverse fiscal incentives by Congress and an
unexpected plunge in income tax receipts laid to bureaucratic confusion
under the previous economic team.  Restored tax breaks alone have cost
the federal treasury an estimated US$1.77 billion, boosting total
giveaways through fiscal incentives to a crushing US$7.82 billion -- or
1.51% of GDP.  Bureaucratic foulups in income tax collection over the
past year have cost the treasury another US$1 billion.

Despite these fiscal problems, Moreira stands a good chance of
persuading the Fund to sign off on a new credit facility so long as he can
offer convincing evidence that the economic situation has been stabilized
and inflation has been brought under control.  In this context, the July
inflation figures assume added weight as an indicator of the credibility
and effectiveness of Moreira's economic policy management.  His clout
with US and IMF officials in Washington should also help -- but no
amount of influence could overcome a renewed deterioration in the
inflation trend.  To bolster anti-inflation policy, Moreira has concentrated
his formidable diplomatic skills on persuading Congress of the need to
resist pressure for a return to full-fledged wage indexation.  His success
in maintaining wage restraint thus far should improve Brazil's case with
the IMF.  Moreira also can be expected to emphasize the fiscal windfall
anticipated from the dramatic shortening of the term for industrial tax
collections under EM 297.

Assuming July inflation holds below 11%, Moreira is well positioned to
gain IMF approval of a new letter of intent, clearing the way for signoff
on a credit facility.  Moreira's immediate objective is to gain IMF
commitment to an 18-month standby loan, which currently is expected
to total between US$1.5-2 billion.  If Brazil remains on course in
meeting its IMF targets, the economy minister is expected to seek
subsequent Fund approval of an extended fund facility for a three-year
term, with a credit commitment totaling US$3 billion or more.  If the
IMF hurdle can be cleared, Moreira remains optimistic that a deal with
commercial bank creditors can be reached by yearend.  The bank talks
can be expected to proceed in parallel with renegotiation of Paris Club
debt, currently estimated at around US$4 billion.

Terms for securitization of exports were regulated by the Central Bank
this week in Carta Circular 2185, which will allow Brazilian exporters
to negotiate loans in foreign currency with an international financial
institution using export revenues as collateral.  Sources in Brasilia report
that Brazilian exporters already have filed requests at the Central Bank
totaling a massive US$1.5 billion for approval of securitization
operations.  The new mechanism for export financing already appears to
be supplanting traditional reliance on short-term credit lines from foreign
banks.  According to exporters, securitization is advantageous since it
allows for longer terms, lower interest rates and larger volumes of cash
in foreign currency rather than cruzeiros.  The CB regulation allows
Brazilian exporters to open foreign bank accounts where they can deposit
part of their revenues.
The National Monetary Council this week also approved the rules for
conversion of foreign debt for financing environmental projects.  A
conversion fund will be constituted by conversion of debt into Treasury
papers denominated in cruzeiros with FX correction and fixed interest of
6% yearly.  Brazilian debt would be acquired abroad at prevailing
secondary market discounts and exchanged for Treasury papers.  CB
President Francisco Gros said that the G7 commitment at the London
summit to initial investment in Amazon conservation will be discussed
within the rules approved this week.  In a first stage, the government has
set a ceiling of US$100 million on this type of conversion, but Gros
already concedes that this limit may well be increased.

A consortium of eight foreign private bank creditors headed by Austria's
BBA Creditanstalt-Bankverein plans to participate in the Brazilian
privatization process through debt-equity conversions.  This marks the
first time that a group of creditor banks has joined for this purpose. The
other banks in the consortium are Amro of Holland, Banco Portugues do
Atlantico of Portugal, Generale Bank of Belgium, Dresdner and BFG of
Germany, and UBS and SBC of Switzerland.  A leading figure in putting
together the consortium is former CB President Fernao Bracher,
president of BBA Creditanstalt in Brazil.

After moving up at the beginning of the week, interest rates began to
slide on July 17.  The traditional pattern of government expenditures
above receipts in the second half of the month is one factor; another is
the conclusion of reschedulings for most state banks with outstanding
debt obligations to the Central Bank.  Interbank CD rates dropped at
midweek from 17.5% monthly to 15.3%; private bank CDs were offered
for yearly rates of 325/340%, trending lower.  The official CB reference
rate, or TRD, for July has been set slightly higher at 10.05%, broadly
consistent with inflation estimates for the month.

The black dollar moved at midweek to Cr$364/366, at a 10.9% premium
over the commercial rate at Cr$329/330.  Gold prices edged up to
Cr$4,307, for a 10.8% advance over the past month.  After rallying
early in the week, the BOVESPA dropped 0.4% on July 17 to 14,164
points with a trading volume of Cr$9.48 billion; the BVRJ rose 0.9% to
57,683 points with trading volume at Cr$2.58 billion.  Telebras, the
telecoms parastatal, accounted for close to half of July 17 trading on
BOVESPA on expectations of spectacular first half profits exceeding
US$500 million.

BANK CONSOLIDATION, BRAZIL-STYLE

Brazilian bank earnings reports for the first five months of the year show
an industry that has grown in numbers -- and deteriorated in profitability.
The number of banks in Brazil has reached 239, and 116 -- nearly half
--  reported losses for the January-May period.

In good part, this negative performance reflects the fallout from an
excessive expansion of the industry in 1990, spurred by a flurry of
incorporations of small and medium-size institutions.  Liberalization of
rules for bank incorporation under the 1988 constitution and subsequent
regulations issued by the Sarney administration set the stage for last
year's expansion.  The result was a surge in institutions from 153 in
1989 to the present 239.

The irony is that the expansion occurred even as the draconian freeze of
investment funds implemented under the original Collor Plan in March
1990 drained liquidity from the system.  Total liquidity in the banking
system shrunk by nearly 50%, from US$116.5 billion in 1989 to US$59
billion in 1990.  Many of the new banks were not well prepared to face
the adversities of 1990.  Most were founded by industrial and retail
groups, restructured brokerages and distributors seeking to profit from
lucrative margins of as much as 50% that prevailed in the last months of
the Sarney administration.  Then came the liquidity crunch, followed by
a wave of bankruptcies in the second half of 1990 and a continued
monetary squeeze that put additional pressure on industry profit margins.

Few of the new banks thus far have failed as a result of these financial
pressures.  But industry executives believe that many will eventually
have to seek mergers to avoid going under, which could reduce the total
number of banks by as much as 40% over the next year.

AIRCRAFTS FOR SALE

With the debut selloff of the state-owned steelmaker Usiminas set for
September, the Collor government is preparing to launch its second
privatization with sale of the jet-turbine maintenance firm Companhia
Eletromecanica.  Celma, with assets officially valued at US$84 million,
will be privatized in several stages.  An initial tender of up to 10% of
total Celma shares will be offered to employees; United Technology,
which currently owns a 13% shareholding in Celma, will be offered the
option to increase its stake up to the 40% maximum established for
foreign shareholders in the privatization process.  Remaining Celma
stock will go on the block for public offer on October 22.

One problem that has held back privatization of Celma is the fact that it
is the only domestic company qualified to service Brazilian Air Force
jets.  This issue was resolved through inclusion of a special clause in
privatization terms that guarantees such maintenance will be continued.

Though the Celma selloff is on a much smaller scale than the Usiminas
deal, its sale breaks a number of nationalistic taboos and paves the way
for a much more significant privatization: Brazil's biggest aircraft maker,
Embraer.  The recent surprise appointment of former Infrastructure
Minister Ozires Silva as president of Embraer -- the company he headed
from its founding until he assumed the Petrobras presidency in 1986 --
has been widely interpreted as a mission to get the parastatal ready for
privatization.

ARGENTINA

GOOD NEWS on the inflation front: The cost-of-living index should
ease this month to a range of 2.2-2.5%, from 3.1% in June.  Economy
Minister Cavallo has taken the initiative with a new decree issued this
week to end blanket wage indexation, a key element in the government's
anti-inflation strategy.

But don't expect organized labor to accept wage restraint meekly.
Steelworkers boss Lorenzo Miguel already has called a new 24-hour
general strike for July 24, in protest of plans by the state-owned steel
giant Somisa to lay off roughly one-third of its 13,000-strong workforce.
CGT Saul Ubaldini is challenging the government on another front -- he
is widely expected to enter the Buenos Aires gubernatorial contest as an
independent in September, and his anticipated vote share of up to 5%
would likely come at the expense of Peronist nominee Eduardo Duharde.
And the emerging alliance of Luis Barrionuevo, Ubaldini and Miguel --
the so-called "BUM" factor -- poses a major threat to government wage
policy.  Current expectations are that Cavallo will seek to hold wage
adjustments within a range of 5-8% and limit adjustments to no more
than a semi-annual basis, but the unions promise rough sailing ahead.

The Menem government is moving to wrap up final terms for agreement
with the Fund, bolstered by continued price stability.  The target date for
signing of the IMF standby accord now appears to be July 29, with a
first tranche of US$260 million expected to be disbursed in September
from a one-year facility totaling US$1.04 billion.

The political situation is growing increasingly complicated as the
Peronists move toward what could prove a devastating defeat in
September congressional and gubernatorial elections.  Radical leader and
former president Raul Alfonsin already is predicting a Peronist debacle
and demanding a "national unity" government at the federal level.  One
of the more extraordinary endorsements for a unity pact among the major
parties came from former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who
suggested to Foreign Ministere Guido di Tella that such a move would
bolster foreign investor confidence in Argentina.

President Menem appears unlikely to give ground until the election
results are in, though speculation is rife that he will implement a
reshuffle at Interior if the ruling party suffers serious setbacks.  Present
forecasts anticipate that the Peronists will lose a substantial number of
congressional seats and governorships, with the Radicals making modest
gains but provincial parties staging the largest advances.  The 120-seat
Peronist plurality on the 254-seat lower house looks certain to undergo
serious erosion, though the party could cling to its majority in the
Senate.

The federal government's confrontation with the provinces deepened with
the brash move by Radical Governor Massaccesi in Rio Negro to seize
(with local police assistance) funds held at a CB-related federal financial
institution in the region.  Massaccesi claimed that the seizure was
justified by his need to meet state payrolls and the federal government's
failure to provide the provinces adequate resources to meet basic
financial requirements.  The conspicuous lack of criticism from other
provincial leaders has left Economy Minister Cavallo isolated in his
efforts to force return of the seized funds, though the federal government
has tightened the squeeze by canceling clearing for the province for new
withdrawals.

NEW ZEALAND

CONSUMER PRICES rose just 0.1% in the second quarter, the least
since 1967, while annual inflation slowed sharply to 2.8%.  This places
New Zealand ahead of all major OECD countries, including Australia,
Germany, Japan, the US and UK -- its biggest trading partners.  The
obvious implication is that local goods will become increasingly
competitive in foreign markets, and confirms our belief that the longer-
term outlook for the economy is decidedly bullish.  The continued
depreciation of the kiwi dollar to under the key 57-cent level against the
greenback and toward 57 on the TWI carries little inflation risk, and
instead will support a durable expansion led by exports later this year.

Inflation fell in most categories, particularly in transportation, household
and food costs.  Significantly, existing house prices fell 0.6% in the
quarter, the first drop since 1977.  Adjustment for volatile energy prices,
tax-related changes and other one-off factors yields an underlying annual
inflation rate of 2.2%, down from 2.7% in the first quarter and 4% a
year ago.  Weak domestic demand, falling real wages and falling
inflation expectations are all favorable portents.  NZNB economists
forecast underlying price growth of 2.3% for all of 1991.

The reaction of the Reserve Bank to the CPI result, which was in line
with expectations, speaks volumes about the official commitment to price
stability.  Market participants had hoped for a signal that the RB would
now tolerate a positively sloped yield curve; on July 15, the gap between
90 days and five years was virtually flat, compared with minus 151 bp
one year ago.  Instead, the CB declared that the encouraging headline
inflation rate overstates the actual improvement, and supported this with
its housing adjusted price index, which rose 0.3% in June and 3.4%
year-on-year.  Clearly, the monetary authority is not contemplating a
significant shift in policy as a result of the second quarter CPI.  On the
contrary, the RB noted that wholesale interest rates and the exchange rate
have already largely discounted the improvement in inflation.  Finally,
it warned that modest credit easing awaits further evidence that price
pressures remain under control and confirmation in this month's budget
that the government's fiscal house will be put in order.

PHILIPPINES

ECONOMICS AND POLITICS have taken a turn for the worse.
Government statisticians report that the economy is at a virtual standstill,
after an imperceptible 0.2% expansion in the first quarter.  Inflation rose
to a five-year high of 19.0% annually in June, and unemployment hit a
six-year peak of 15.1% in April, which is certain to increase further as
the 600,000 layoffs linked to the Mount Pinatubo eruption flow through
to the official data.

The recent political developments are equally bearish.  The resignation
of Oscar Orbos, President Aquino's eminently capable and trusted
executive secretary, was apparently the result of a cabinet power play.
Orbos was principally responsible for implementing a local version of
glasnost and perestroika, which have made the administration more
accessible to the electorate and streamlined the bloated government
bureaucracy; his absence will be sorely felt.  At the same time, Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos vacated his portfolio to pursue the ruling party's
mandate in the May 1992 elections.  These departures will leave the
president without two of her most popular advisers, just as a social crisis
is emerging on the horizon.

Indeed, opposition members Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and VP Salvador
Laurel recently warned of impending chaos -- food riots staged by the
thousands left jobless, hungry and homeless by the fury of Pinatubo.
Although this strikes IR as deliberately alarmist and laden with ulterior
political motives, the deteriorating economy does have explosive
potential.  Both the rightist Iglesia Ni Kristo Church of Christ group and
the leftist Kilusang Mayo Uno May 1st movement are planning massive
rallies.  Their demands: rollback of petroleum prices to the level of
December 4, 1990, when Aquino pushed through sharp increases to
comply with IMF guidelines; and elimination of the 9% import surtax
implemented in January.

The INK's agenda could well extend beyond these two issues.  Loyal to
the late President Marcos, closely knit and thus politically influential, this
extremist sect is capable of putting all of its 4 million supporters on the
streets.  The apparent gambit: If the Catholic church was able to
organize one million for the historic people-power movement in February
1986 that led to Marcos's demise, the INK can do the same to Aquino.
To guard against infiltration by troublemakers, the sect has recruited
thousands of marshals backed by six helicopters.

In contrast, the KMU has a proven track record for provoking violence.
And IR does not dismiss the possibility that renegade Col. "Gringo"
Honasan and his Reform Armed Forces Movement might seek to take
advantage of the situation by mounting another coup attempt.  Two
hopeful notes: The conservative Federation of Free Farmers and the
Trade Union Congress of the Philippines will not join the INK and KMU
in the street demonstrations; and the unofficial ceasefire continues to hold
in the volcano-affected regions and insurgency-related incidents
elsewhere remain subdued.

Perhaps the worst news came from Washington, which disclosed that
Clark AFB will be abandoned after all because of the devastation
wrought by the volcano.  A Pentagon survey team estimated that it would
cost US$500-800 million to dig out the 9,000-acre base and repair
runways and more than 70 buildings that were damaged by ash.  Thus,
the Air Force will vacate Clark at the expiration of the existing lease on
September 16, 1992.  But the US considered Subic Naval Base with its
strategically important deep-water port worth the cost of rehabilitation.
In fact, the Pinatubo disaster put new urgency into the talks that have
dragged on for 14 months.  Chief negotiator Richard Armitage's
bargaining position was substantially enhanced by the dire economic
circumstances in the Philippines, and by the growing congressional
opposition to any continued military presence on the islands when the US
is shuttering dozens of installations at home.  The two sides reached
agreement this week on a new lease for Subic, which carries a 10-year
term and provides for US$400-500 million in cash and in-kind
compensation divided about equally.  This will provide the economy with
urgently needed relief, although the treaty will face stiff opposition in the
Philippine Senate, where approval by a two-thirds vote is required.

The poor political and economic fundamentals explain the collapse of the
Manila Composite to 990 points on July 12 from 1,554 two weeks ago.
Curiously, the peso regrouped from a brief slide to appreciate by 16
centavos to P27.59/US$ in official dealing and by 42 centavos to
US$27.55 in parallel activity -- unsustainable strength in both cases.

INDIA

ECONOMIC reforms have been coming from the new Congress
government of PM Narasimha Rao at such a furious pace that no one is
quite able to figure out their impact on the economy or on specific
industries.  Over the past three weeks, the government has:

* devalued the rupee by around 18% against a basket of currencies and
promised to make the rupee a convertible currency in three to five years'
time;

* overhauled the export policy regime;

* raised bank lending rates; and

* presented a railways budget that makes a determined effort to put
industry finances on a firm footing.

And the most dramatic moves are yet to come.  The government is
drafting a new industrial policy that promises to push deregulation well
beyond previous expectations, and its new budget is expected to narrow
the federal deficit, slash a range of subsidies and launch privatizations for
select public sector enterprises.

In IR's view, the significance of the rupee devaluation has been
exaggerated, and its benefits in the medium term remain unclear.  But
the government had no choice -- not so much because of IMF insistence
as a condition for new credit, but rather to shore up eroded confidence
among international bankers (which led to an almost complete
evaporation of short-term loans) and expatriate Indians (who made heavy
withdrawals from foreign currency deposits held in Indian banks).  At
the pace of deterioration on the eve of devaluation, the country's FX
reserves of R25 billion, equivalent to just two weeks' import cover,
would have run out in three days.  The initial steep devaluation of the
rupee was a dramatic gesture intended to send a message that the new
government was determined to restore economic and fiscal order and
serious about carrying out IMF-approved reforms.  The strategy appears
to have worked -- at least for now.  The run on overseas Indian deposits
has ceased, both because of renewed confidence in the government and
because a devalued rupee implies higher returns for expatriates in rupee
terms.

The long-term implications of rupee devaluation for the balance of
payments, however, are unclear.  The 1966 devaluation of the rupee
failed in the short run because of production constraints caused by
drought, though it did tend to narrow the trade gap over the longer term.
In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the steady decline of the rupee, while
leading to an acceleration of exports, failed to narrow the trade gap as
imports also grew rapidly.  Given that India's export mix remains
heavily weighted toward relatively price-inelastic commodities,
devaluation by itself will not have a major impact on the trade balance
in the near term -- but combined with the entire reform package
proposed, it could make a difference.  The real breakthrough so far has
been the new trade policy, which scraps the vexatious system of
government-issued import licenses with a streamlined system for license
issuance based on export performance (exporters will receive Exim scrips
valued at up to 30% of exports, which will be freely traded).  The
reform eliminates procedural delays and diminishes opportunities for
bureaucratic corruption; more important, it links imports to export
performance -- a definite incentive to manufacturers to step up export
capability.  Import-dependent industries (such as computers and
consumer electronics) will obviously be hit hard, while exporters of
goods with minimal import content (such as various agribusinesses) will
reap windfall profits by selling off Exim scrips they earn but do not
require.  The new trade policy also eliminates cash subsidies for
exporters (the devaluation of 18% should be adequate incentive for
competitive exporters, while uncompetitive exports will cease), saving
the government R40 billion per fiscal year -- a move that will go a long
way toward bridging this year's budget deficit.

Bank lending interest rates have been raised to a minimum of 18% from
the existing 17%, with banks free as before to fix rates over the
minimum.  A move to increase long-term interest rates was announced
earlier.  The moves are intended partly to rein in excess demand in the
economy, but also to answer persistent demands for pricing scarce capital
more realistically.

Rationalization is also the central theme behind railway rate reform, with
both freight and passenger fares hiked to yield a projected budget
surplus.  Market borrowings by the railways will be increased in
accordance with the principle that reliance on budgetary allocations must
diminish, which partly explains the move to reduce subsidies for
passenger travel.

US DOLLAR

The G7 went into the London economic summit with lofty expectations.
Depending on who was talking, these included a pledge to revitalize the
stalled Uruguay round of GATT, improve the coordination of economic
policy, provide debt relief for Third World countries, step up the war on
drugs and money-laundering, draft a plan for environmental protection,
and in general promote sustained economic recovery and price stability
for all.  The formal emphasis on economic issues notwithstanding, the
most important item on the agenda was clearly Mikhail Gorbachev.  In
short, the seven heads of state aimed to do nothing less than manufacture
perestroika on a global scale.

The flurry of communiques issued at the conclusion of the summit
declared substantial progress on all counts.  In fact though, the talks did
little more than confirm that the Seven are not prepared to abandon their
parochial interests for the collective good.  The US expansion is on
track, the economic slowdown in continental Europe and Japan will
continue, the collapsing economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union will collapse further -- despite the best efforts of the august group.
As expected, Bonn eloquently represented Moscow's case for buckets of
Western cash, which was vigorously resisted by Washington and Tokyo.
In the event, the opposing sides compromised and agreed to provide
plenty of moral support for the beleaguered Kremlin leader but no
bailout -- again, as expected.

None of this should have come as a surprise.  On the contrary, the
outcome was virtually preordained and reflects the nettlesome economic,
political and social problems that each of the Seven faces at home.
Japan's Toshiki Kaifu arrived in London somewhat humbled by the
brokerage scandal in Tokyo and revelations that Japanese firms illegally
supplied military hardware to Iraq.  But the others also came with
forgettable baggage, and almost no one could escape responsibility for
the embarrassing BCCI affair.

For the foreign exchanges, the significance is that the solid consensus
that led to the Plaza and Louvre accords no longer exists.  Thus, the
dollar will dance to the tune played in the markets, with little regard to
the preferences of the authorities.  From IR's perspective, the road for
the dollar is clearly up.  Readers are well acquainted with the reasons,
which in brief review focus on the favorable economic and political
fundamentals for the US, particularly when compared with Germany.

The recent statistics indicate further improvement at American factories
and reveal signs of life in the moribund housing market.  Even the
dismal auto industry appears to have rebounded modestly.  At the same
time, both wholesale and retail inflation remain under control (an
unsustainable jump in renter and homeowner costs was responsible for
the 0.4% rise in the core CPI for June).  Granted the rosy outlook
should not be exaggerated -- the unexpected 0.2% decline in retail sales
last month confirms that consumers are not prepared to embark on a
spending binge, and the decline in the personal savings rate to 3.6% in
May suggests that they may not be able to.  But there is no doubt that
the business cycle in the US is ahead of much of the industrialized
world.

Thus, IR is confident of the dollar's longer-term direction, even though
daily and weekly volatility will remain high.  This past week was no
exception.  After trading more quietly in early July, a riot broke out on
July 12, as a pair of weak US statistics combined with a sharp response
from the authorities to send the dollar plummeting from DM1.8410 to a
low of DM1.7850 in a matter of hours.  The repeated bouts of concerted
intervention -- by 15 central banks, including the Fed and Bundesbank
--  reflected truly masterful timing that forced the FX markets into a
defensive mode ahead of the London meeting.  Although no one will
admit as much, the Fed's participation was obviously part of a G7 pact:
The Bundesbank's Poehl agreed to delay tightening at the July 11 council
meeting in exchange for Alan Greenspan's support for a coordinated
attack.

IR's advice all along has been to take advantage of dips to buy cheaply
--  and the markets seem to have the same idea.  Indeed, the dollar was
consistently supported at key levels above DM1.78.  Even the latest
selloff on July 18 linked to the May merchandise trade report (both
exports and imports declined, a sign of weak demand at home and
abroad) failed to inflict the fatal blow.  The greenback was easily beaten
through the critical DM1.7770 area to a low above DM1.7650, but both
the corporates and the dealers stepped in to bid it up to safer levels.  In
our view, the dollar will continue to run on a treadmill until participants
see compelling reasons for a break into a new range.  Thus, we prefer
to believe that current prices are close to an effective bottom.

GERMAN MARK

A BOXING MATCH is in progress.  In one corner, the technicals are
pummeling the dollar lower.  On July 18, the unit broke through support
at DM1.7840 and the more important DM1.7770 level and tumbled an
additional 120 points before regaining its footing.  In the other corner,
the fundamentals have thrown the favorable US economic statistics into
the ring to defend their case for a higher dollar.  The technical analysis
is as follows: We have witnessed a correction after the (halting) rally
from DM1.6900 to DM1.8425.  On this current dollar downtrend, the
support levels are DM1.7850 (already vanquished) and DM1.7650
(dangerously close).  Beyond that lie DM1.7550 and DM1.7480.  As the
theory goes, a break of DM1.7650 heralds a collapse to DM1.6900.
This may look convincing on the charts, but we see little fundamental
justification for a significant dollar correction.  Indeed, the recent
appearance of corporate demand for dollars indicates skepticism among
longer-term participants with the bearish astrology.  In addition, while
the central banks have succeeded admirably in setting up the markets, we
doubt that their strategy is to sell the dollar down to DM1.70.  Thus, we
will operate in a DM1.7550-1.8150 range over the forecast horizon.

JAPANESE YEN

THE CONCERTED central bank defense of the DM on July 12 cost the
yen heavily on the cross, which climbed from Y75.50/DM ahead of the
intervention to test key resistance at Y76.90.  Since then, it has ranged
mostly between Y76.00-76.60 in trendless trading.  The yen broke out
of its narrow range against the dollar and soared 300 points to a high of
Y136.05 during that furious Friday morning.  But in the meantime it has
retreated to Y137.50, and thus we look for it to remain inside of
Y136-139 over the next two weeks.  IR's expectation that the
dollar/mark is near bottom implies that the DM/Y is approaching its top
-- a reversal of the scenario from last week.  Our success with the cross
extends the record to four straight weeks (which will more than pay for
stopping out of the short DM/SF position).  Most recently, readers
bought DM for half at Y75.85 and soon took profit at Y76.85.  Next
week, we suggest selling the cross for 50% at current levels around
Y77.20 with the expectation of again taking 100 points of profit.

We should point out however that there is considerable disagreement
about the outlook.  For example, we hear that Japanese commercial
banks plan to raise substantial amounts of subordinated loans from life
insurance companies.  To increase lending domestically, life insurers
may reduce overseas investment and perhaps even repatriate foreign
funds.  The effect will be to reduce the demand for dollars and other
currencies.  The markets also know that if the yen strengthens -- against
the dollar or EMS bloc -- the insurance companies may need to purchase
yen to hedge their foreign investments.

STERLING

THE MARKETS ignored the 50-bp cut in base rates engineered by the
Bank of England on July 12.  In fact, the pound actually firmed
marginally on the cross to a high of DM2.9631/STG, and currently
appears firm about one pfennig below.  Technicians now see good
support at DM2.95, compared with previous support at
DM2.9350-2.9400.  The markets are also bullish the pound against the
dollar.  One source close to the action saw a US brokerage purchase
STG200 million of US$1.7500 sterling calls on the IMM at midweek.
Nonetheless, IR remains skeptical of this currency and advises steering
clear of a continued rally.  The recent indicators on industrial output,
unemployment and unit labor costs depict continued recession and
resilient inflation pressures.  Readers are still fully short the cross at
DM2.9450 and should take profits at DM2.9180.  Look for a
US$1.6250-1.6850 range against the dollar, and be prepared for sterling
to be punished if major support 30 points under the bottom is broken.
On the yen cross, IR is still short the pound for 50% at Y226.00/STG,
and will sell for the balance at Y228.00.  We have raised the
recommended level to take profits to Y222.50.

SWISS FRANC

THIS CROSS came under additional pressure in the past week.  The
franc tested SF0.8700/DM after the Bundesbank announced that
monetary policy would not change, and has recovered only 30 points
since then.  A contributing factor was a July 17 report that the SNB will
link its currency to the ECU.  The markets interpreted this to mean that
the Swiss are abandoning their traditional ties to the restrictive policies
in Bonn -- a ridiculous assertion since this never was an expressed policy
of the SNB.  In any case, the prevailing dislike for the SF has forced us
to reconsider the near-term outlook.  IR now advises stopping out of
short DM acquired at SF0.8535 at a loss.  Immediately reverse to
purchase the cross for a half lot at current levels around SF0.8660 and
put on a quick stop-loss at SF0.8625.  Against the dollar, IR nailed the
actual range for the July 17 week -- SF1.5443-1.5942, 40 points above
prediction (although the dollar broke through the bottom during the July
18 selloff).  A test of SF1.52 is possible over the fortnight, while the
dollar should face resistance at SF1.57.

FRENCH FRANC

THE FUNDAMENTAL strength of this franc was confirmed by the June
CPI -- up 0.2% from the previous month and 3.3% from a year ago.
This brought the growth rate of French prices under the German rate
(3.5% at present) for the first time since 1973, and assures membership
in the elite group of low-inflation countries.  It also reflects the
commitment in Paris to building a strong currency through tough wage
bargaining and a refusal to follow a beggar-thy-neighbor policy of
devaluation.  Thus, IR's longer-term confidence in the FF is intact.  But
in the immediate future we cannot rule out a rise in the cross over
FF3.40/DM, in view of the softer tone in franc deposit rates linked to
recent remarks from FM Beregovoy that hint at a 25-bp cut in the CB's
intervention rate.  Consequently, we are more comfortable to square up
short DM at current levels around FF3.3930 for a modest profit of 10
points.  Over the forecast horizon, readers should sell the cross for 50%
at FF3.3975, and short for the balance at FF3.4050.  Against the dollar,
buy francs at FF6.16 and sell at FF5.95.

CANADIAN DOLLAR

THE RECESSION may be over, but IR remains skeptical and has a
receptive audience among Canadian business executives.  Indeed, many
are now raising the possibility of a double-dip recession that is also
mentioned south of the border.  At the very least, the economic recovery
will proceed from a deep hole, with little assistance from fiscal or
monetary policy.  Readers are familiar with our aversion to the high-
yielding currencies.  The Canadian dollar is a particular favorite as a
parking place for speculative Japanese capital, which has little allegiance.
Indeed, further revelations about what is billed as "Canada's Watergate"
triggered overnight selling on July 18 by three major Tokyo banks and
sent the Can$ tumbling by nearly 100 points to Can$1.1565.  Those who
have patiently held greenbacks purchased at Can$1.1470 took 70 points
of profit on the move.  IR recommends employing a similar strategy at
slightly higher levels in the weeks ahead: Buy US for half of positions
on a dip to Can$1.15 with a view to taking a full cent of profit.

AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR

THE JUNE employment report revealed a modest but unexpected drop
in the jobless rate to 9.3%, and a more moderate rate of decline in full-
time payrolls.  Canberra says -- we agree -- that Australia is slowly
emerging from an unusually deep recession, and surveys of business
expectations point to the same conclusion.  However, we are less
optimistic about the pace and strength of the recovery.  The labor market
in particular will remain weak for the foreseeable future, and a further
rise in the unemployment rate toward 10% is not out of the question.  In
fact, the Treasury forecasts a peak rate of 10.75%.  That seems unduly
pessimistic, but may help to explain the prevailing expectation for an
additional 50-bp reduction in official cash rates to 10% next month.  The
market is tipping at a credit easing to accompany the second quarter
reports on consumer prices on August 7 or the national accounts on
August 15.  This could cut short the Aussie dollar's stubborn rally to a
high of US$0.7767 this week.  In fact, the unit slid 40 points on July 17
amid rumors (quickly denied) that the RBA had sold the A$ around
US$0.7750.  True or not, the reaction indicates that dealers have little
confidence in holding long Aussie positions.  IR expects to take 100
points of profit on short A$ acquired at US$0.7600, but now advises
laying a stop at US$0.7810 to protect against an unlikely bounce.

OVERVIEW

CONVERGENCE WAS THE KEY to profits in European bond markets
as this year began, and until recently inflation and interest rates appeared
to be trending toward Germany's more desirable levels.  FX risk aside,
this partly explains why, in the first half of 1991, Spanish bonds
outperformed all other major government instruments with a local-
currency total return of 13.9%.  But now that the drop in inflation has
stalled in Spain and Italy -- the other high-yielder -- high nominal returns
no longer suffice.  Meanwhile, inflation in Germany has crept up to
3.5% and looks headed over 4%, pulling up the anchor of European
convergence.  With German bond yields on the rise and the Bundesbank
expected to hike its central rates when its leadership returns from
holiday, some observers see pressure on yields in other major
government securities markets.

A case in point is France, where inflation, now at an annual 3.3% rate,
is below Germany's for the first time since 1973.  Finance Minister
Pierre Beregovoy makes no bones about wanting to cut interest rates,
much to the dismay of analysts who point to a vulnerable exchange rate
and inevitable German tightening.  Yet the French market, bolstered by
an influx of capital fleeing Bunds, has shown some willingness to bring
down yields.  The lesson from this is that convergence, which took its
compass bearings from Germany, is off for the moment, although it
might be going too far to say divergence is now the rule.  Still, in
months to come, markets with sound fundamentals will pave their own
road while Germany struggles down the reunification path.  German rates
are pushing to attractive levels, but unfurling risk in Frankfurt makes the
50-bp premium offered by French OATs even more attractive and gives
Beregovoy leeway to push down rates regardless of the BB's intentions.

UNITED STATES

TREASURIES saw both extremes over the past week.  Investors were
alternately encouraged by retreating producer prices and weak retail
sales, and discouraged by unexpectedly high June consumer inflation and
housing starts.  The latter figures carried more weight.  The 5.2% gain
in housing starts built the case for a durable -- if not necessarily dynamic
-- recovery, while the rise in consumer prices disappointed bulls who
pointed to the textbook tendency of inflation to slow in the wake of a
recession.  However, economists are learning that the 1990-91 recession
is following an unpublished textbook, much to the chagrin of participants
who loaded up on long maturities.  Other factors contributed to the
uncertain bond outlook.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan launched his
twice-yearly testimony to Congress on the economy.  His message was
mixed in its implications for the Treasuries market: Despite compelling
signs of recovery, the central bank looks for meaningful progress on
inflation.  But that was before the July 17 release of consumer prices --
up just 0.2% overall, but with core (excluding energy and food) prices
up 0.4%.  Bond investors took that as an indication that inflationary
pressures have not been purged by the recession and continue to threaten
real returns.  That, taken with the housing starts data, sparked selling
and markdowns to push the key 30-year bond yield to 8.49% on July 17,
from 8.43% on July 12 after the PPI release.

A rise in applications for jobless benefits on July 18 did not appear to
break the recent trend of improvement in the labor market, and thus was
of little help.  During the July 18 session the long bond yield improved
slightly to 8.47%, but the upward bias remains.  With the June inflation
figures behind it, the market has begun to focus on issues of supply.  In
the week ahead participants face the sale of US$12.5 billion in two-year
notes and US$9.25 billion in five-year notes.  But of greater concern is
the August quarterly refunding operation, which has been estimated at
US$37.5 billion, another record.  Specific figures on the refunding are
to be released July 31 -- which could accelerate sales and markdowns to
push the key yield toward the 8.60% level.  Over the shorter term,
however, the market could well manage to hold within the range pivoting
around 8.50% on grounds that the jury is still out about the strength of
the recovery.  It may also reconsider the CPI data, which suffered from
some one-off influences.  There has been some idle talk of another Fed
easing, but this seems improbable in view of the encouraging indicators
and the bond market's resilient inflation jitters.  "Watchful waiting," in
Greenspan's artful phrasing, speaks volumes, which makes intermediate
maturities -- twos to fives -- the place to be.

JAPAN

TOKYO BOND ACTIVITY was not reinvigorated by the return of the
Big Four securities houses to full trading after their slap-on-the-wrist,
four-day suspension for unethical dealings.  Indeed, IR wonders if there
is anything capable of shaking the Japanese government bond market out
of its torpor.  The recent half-point cut in the official discount rate has
been absorbed without significant benefit to bonds.  It would not surprise
us if the Bank of Japan were to give the markets another 50-bp cut in the
discount rate by the end of this quarter (sooner if the Nikkei plunges
below 22,000).  But that cannot be counted upon and the market may be
obliged to bide its time and await further indications of a decelerating
economy, better price data and restoration of a positive yield curve.  In
the meantime, bonds may do worse before they do better.

We have seen reports that Japanese banks, under pressure to defend their
capital ratios eroded by the Nikkei's recent declines, intend to sell off as
much as 30% of their bond holdings this year and next.  But a fall in
money market rates could bolster the Nikkei and convince Japanese life
insurers to shift from cash and short-term instruments into bonds, in
expectation of a rally later this year assisted by a relatively strong yen.
But until the CB moves to cut the ODR from its present 5.5% level,
there will be little interest for participants to increase exposure in
Japanese bonds.  The money market reveals no expectation of an
imminent cut, with the key unsecured overnight call rate trading around
7.50% and the three-month CD changing hands at 7.60-7.65%.  Those
rates still figure very favorably with the benchmark 10-year government
bond yield, which on July 18 stood at 6.74% after 6.78% a week earlier.
IR expects little progress in the week ahead.

GERMANY

ALTHOUGH the London economic summit lightened the burden on
Bunds of a Soviet economic debacle, the investment climate in Germany
itself continued to deteriorate.  While Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Finance Minister Theo Waigel were urging the rescue of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika program, their opposition at home was
on the offensive.  An SPD leader scoffed at Waigel's estimate of a
DM140 billion public sector deficit this year, claiming it would amount
to some DM202.1 billion; Rudi Walther, head of the Bundestag's budget
committee, said rising deficits were having devastating financial effects.
Later the FM acknowledged a rise to DM156 billion, after which
Deutsche Bank chief economist Norbert Walter forecast what the markets
already know: The Bundesbank will have to raise interest rates later this
year.  Despite this, the bond market held its own during the issuance of
DM2.39 billion one- and two-year zero-coupon notes.  They went down
at average yields of 9.20% (with a tail to 9.28%) and 9.18%,
respectively.  The benchmark 10-year federal bond closed on July 17 at
a yield of 8.59%, continuing a steady advance in the week.

Market sentiment took a turn for the worse the next day, ironically just
as the DM continued its rally against the dollar, on the basis of the July
monthly report of the Bundesbank and the US trade report.  The CB said
the price climate was worsening considerably even before the tax hike
was implemented this month.  Private economists see the cost of living
surging to 4.2-4.3% in July compared with 3.5% in June, and the central
bank's policy-making council is not expected to respond by raising rates
before August 15.  While this inflationary surge was expected, the
revised PSBR projection has conjured up images of a tidal wave of new
supply, further depressing prices and driving up yields.  On July 18 the
key 8 3/8% 10-year government bond yielded 8.66% as the futures
contract crashed through support levels; market operators are looking for
buying interest only at 8.75%.  In the current climate, IR expects Bunds
to quickly reach that target -- at which investors may wish to begin
cautiously acquiring government paper.

UNITED KINGDOM

AS IR EXPECTED, the Bank of England cut the base lending rate by 50
bp to 11% on July 12, even though the RPI figures released by the CSO
were above forecast.  Retail inflation remained at a 12-month rate of
5.8% in June, the same as in May, due mainly to seasonal rises in food
prices.  Excluding mortgage payments, the rate rose to 6.9% from 6.6%.
Gilt investors decided things were as good as they would be for a while
and began to lighten up, with many shifting funds to the French
government bond market.  But there was more erosion at the front end
than in long maturities, given the strong fundamentals at the far end.
Supply concerns are an additional factor.  On July 12 the BoE said it will
issue STG500 million in paper in tranches of 12% and 9.5% stock due
1998 and 2005, respectively.  Though well received, that contributed to
the market's more tenuous tone.

However, it's premature to say that the gilts rally is over.  Exchequer
Norman Lamont said at the summit that while he looks for a second half
recovery, it has not yet begun.  On July 18 the market received a battery
of economic data that was relatively bullish for bonds.  Unemployment
rose to 8.1% in June from 7.9% in May and industrial production fell
by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in May after a 2.7% fall in April.  While
the figures cast doubt on predictions of a double-dip recession, they do
indicate that the first dip is not over.  Thus, gilts will probably progress
further.  On July 18 the benchmark 10% gilt maturing in February 2001
yielded 10.27%, compared with 10.20% after the rate cut on July 12 and
10.26% a week earlier.  The longer-dated 11 3/4% of 2003 yielded
10.22% against 10.27% a week before,   and the 12% coupon of 2017
yielded 9.97% after  10.02%.  IR sees continued declines in yields in the
weeks ahead, although progress on the short end will depend on
expectations for additional credit easing.  But with elections apparently
delayed until 1992 and inflation now stalled, the next cut is unlikely to
come until late in the summer.

OTHER MARKETS

French bonds were well bid this week on June's 3.3% inflation rate.
There was some disappointment on July 16, when the Bank of France
left its intervention rate at 9% in a tender operation, which may be
linked to official concern that the franc might suffer.  But a 25-bp cut --
the same as the last, in March -- is being discounted with inflation seen
at 2.8% by yearend.  Still, foreign investors remain wary of the policies
of Socialist PM Edith Cresson.  Securities prices rose in the week as
Beregovoy said low inflation would boost the franc and allow rate cuts.
Yields fell 12-14 bp at an auction of two- and five-year notes on July 17,
but the next day players balked at a large FF11 billion note tender.
However, support levels held and prices looked firm.  The benchmark
9.5% 10-year bond finished at 9.14%, up three bp from one week
before.  Progress is likely to be tied closely to the franc's position in the
EMS grid.  Elsewhere, Spanish yields pushed up on July 18 after
government-union talks on a proposed wage and productivity pact broke
down.  The yield at a tender of one-year bills rose to 12.04% from
11.73% at the last such tender.  Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga
warned of tighter fiscal policy and higher interest rates in answer to
inflation, which is stubbornly holding around 6%.  Failure of the wage
and productivity negotiations squelch talk that the Bank of Spain might
ease its 12.75% intervention rate.
