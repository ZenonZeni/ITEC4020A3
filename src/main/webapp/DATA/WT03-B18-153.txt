<tt>CONCAWE is an effective and principled forum which exists because
its rational approach is essential to the proper resolution of complex issues.

<P>In the very first issue of the CONCAWE Review, Volume 1, Number 1 in
April 1992, the opening article entitled 'About CONCAWE' introduced our
organization to the worldwide Review readership which contains a very broad
spread of interests with a variety of needs. We hope that the existence
of the CONCAWE Review has kept you well informed about what CONCAWE is and
does. So we think it unnecessary to tell you again 'what CONCAWE is', but
'why CONCAWE is' may not be as clear.<BR>
<BR>
Most oil companies who refine crude oil in Western (OECD) Europe have chosen
to be CONCAWE members, several of them continuously so since 1963. Furthermore,
the possibility of associate membership for Eastern European oil companies
has recently been opened up and what is hopefully the first of many such
companies has already signed up. It is all of these companies that contribute
the essential resources to keep CONCAWE viable. The annual costs of CONCAWE
and the people who contribute management and technical expertise to CONCAWE
on a part-time basis are major commitments. These are particularly to be
appreciated in today's competitive times of downsizing and the need to extract
maximum value out of the existing assets.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE is founded as an international association with a scientific objective
and without profit-making intent. Our product is sound economic, technical
and scientific information and our mission is to disseminate it to all the
players with influence in our field. This means finding out as many of the
facts of a matter as can be determined by applying the rigour of a scientific
approach. Many issues are very complex and, where opinions are required,
CONCAWE's advice is rationally based and unbiased taking account of all
the knowledge that we can bring to bear. We publish our findings not only
for our sponsoring industry but for the neutral players and the opponents
too. CONCAWE's track record of trustworthiness is its greatest asset and
is carefully safeguarded in all it does.<BR>
<BR>
By maintaining CONCAWE, our members ensure that reliable information on
environmental, health and safety issues gets tabled, even if their own individual
situations may be somewhat different. Thus all the involved parties have
a true basis for a rational debate. But it's not altruism that keeps the
member companies speaking with one voice as CONCAWE; each company can fight
for its own interests in other forums. The companies are united in seeing
the fundamental needs for CONCAWE's existence and the greater cost-effectiveness
achievable by this approach. What the companies also gain by working cooperatively
through CONCAWE is elimination of the replication of many tasks which each
company would otherwise have to do for itself. In the field of environment health and safety, the involvement of a wide range of scarce specialists can be necessary. Both the quality and the quantity of what is done are enhanced by fielding the companies' best and most dedicated experts together in teams which are well-managed to get timely results.<BR>
