<P>Benzene was included in the first list of priority substances for evaluation
under the requirements of the EU Regulation (No. 793/93) on the evaluation
and control of the risks of existing substances. There were 42 substances
on the first list, published in May 1994, and benzene is one of 18 for
which Germany is the rapporteur.</P>

<P>In Germany, the competent authority requested industry to prepare a
report, characterizing the risk for benzene, which would be used as the
basis for the risk assessment. When the rapporteur has prepared the risk
assessment report it will be reviewed by industry and EU Member States'
experts, before final approval. It was also agreed that all sources of
benzene (including its presence in gasoline) should be taken into account
in the risk characterization. The place of this risk characterization in
the overall risk assessment process was covered in CONCAWE Review Volume
4, Number 1 (April 1995), pp. 12-14. </P>

<P>The risk characterization report was prepared, under contract, by Exxon
Biomedical Sciences Inc. (EBSI) for CONCAWE, EUROPIA and the CEFIC Aromatic
Producers Association (APA). It was given to the German competent authority
in May 1996, who now has to prepare the EU risk assessment for benzene.
However, the time-scale for this is unclear and completion could take some
time. The purpose of this article is to explain briefly what is included
in the Industry report and to summarize the key findings regarding the
characterization of the environmental and health risks associated with
benzene.</P>

<P>The industry risk characterization report follows closely the Technical
Guidance Document which was prepared jointly by EU Member States, the Commission
and Industry. It represents the most up-to-date, comprehensive review of
the environmental and health effects of benzene. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>THE&nbsp;FINDINGS</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><I>Health<BR>
</I>The report summarizes the various health effects that have been described
and identifies the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>n</FONT></B>o <B><FONT SIZE=+1>o</FONT></B>bserved
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>a</FONT></B>dverse <B><FONT SIZE=+1>e</FONT></B>ffect
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>evel (NOAEL) for each of them. The critical
human health effect (i.e. the adverse health effect of most concern) from
repeated occupational exposure to low levels of benzene is the occurrence
of <B><FONT SIZE=+1>a</FONT></B>cute <B><FONT SIZE=+1>n</FONT></B>on-<B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>ymphocytic
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>eukaemia (ANLL). </P>

<P>The epidemiology studies demonstrate that ANLL has occurred above occupational
exposure levels of 20-50 parts per million (ppm) of benzene in the ambient
air, i.e. 64 000 to 160 000 microgrammes per cubic metre (&#181;g/m3)
expressed as <B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>ong-<B><FONT SIZE=+1>t</FONT></B>erm
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>a</FONT></B>verage concentrations (LTA). ANLL has not
been observed in individuals occupationally exposed to levels of 1 ppm
or less. </P>

<P>Mechanistic studies indicate that the occurrence of ANLL is a multi-step
process and some of the steps do not occur unless a certain threshold concentration
is exceeded. It follows, that the overall process of the occurrence of
ANLL is dependent on a threshold concentration, which differs from the
previous view that, for benzene carcinogenesis, the threshold concentration
is zero.</P>

<P>The true threshold concentration for ANLL lies somewhere between 1 and
20 ppm LTA, possibly even higher. For the purpose of the risk characterization,
1 ppm (3200 (&#181;g/m3) has been taken as the NOAEL which is a conservative,
responsible approach.</P>

<P>The report includes the available exposure data for each of four sub-populations
of the general public, and 46 sub-populations of workers occupationally
exposed to benzene. For each of the sub-populations it calculates the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>m</FONT></B>argins
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>o</FONT></B>f <B><FONT SIZE=+1>s</FONT></B>afety (MOS)
i.e. the ratios of the NOAELs to the observed exposure concentrations which
occur. </P>

<P>The arithmetic mean levels of benzene to which the general public is
exposed are calculated to range from 8.6 &#181;g/m3 (2.7 parts per billion-ppb)
to 10.9 &#181;g/m3 (3.4 ppb). The MOS calculations show that the mean
degree of safety with respect to benzene carcinogenesis is about a factor
of 300 or more. Furthermore, urban benzene levels are expected to drop
substantially over the next few years due to the progressive replacement
of non-catalyst equipped cars and other legislated measures. Thus there
is at present no need for risk reduction measures beyond those that are
being applied already.</P>

<P>For the worker sub-populations, mean exposures are generally below 3200
&#181;g/m3 and therefore the cancer risk MOSs are above 1. Gathering further
information, and/or more testing is indicated for a few groups of workers.
</P>

<P><I>Environment<BR>
</I>All reported effects on aquatic and terrestrial organisms are summarized
and, for each reported effect, the concentration at which no effect is
observed-the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>redicted <B><FONT SIZE=+1>n</FONT></B>o
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>e</FONT></B>ffect <B><FONT SIZE=+1>c</FONT></B>oncentration
(PNEC)-is identified. These PNECs are compared with the available information
on the measured or <B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>redicted <B><FONT SIZE=+1>e</FONT></B>nvironmental
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>c</FONT></B>oncentrations (PECs) of benzene in the various
environmental compartments, in order to identify scenarios involving risk.
</P>

<P>Most industrial benzene plants with advanced effluent treatment plants
pose no benzene-related environmental risks. In the few cases where there
is limited waste-water treatment the uncertainty is greater. For such sites,
further monitoring and emissions data are required to refine the evaluations.</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Bol2.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=14><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>WHAT&nbsp;DOES&nbsp;IT&nbsp;MEAN?</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The existence of a threshold concentration means that the low levels
of benzene exposure for the general public poses no health risks. Further
controls on benzene emissions are not expected to have any effect at all
on the risk of contracting leukaemia.</P>

<P>From an occupational health point of view it is important to recognize
that, currently, there are only very few industrial activities possibly
associated with occupational exposures to benzene at levels greater than
1 ppm LTA. This is because either the operation itself is not practised
so widely and/or controls have been introduced to reduce exposure levels.
Continued monitoring is required, however, to verify the current situation
and to ensure that occupational exposure to benzene is kept within the
1 ppm level. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Water, air and soil-borne exposures to benzene do not pose a risk to
the environment, except possibly in some industrial and commercial situations
where there are no waste-water treatment facilities. Provided that further
monitoring can establish that benzene levels in surface waters are below
predicted no-effect levels at these locations, no further action is anticipated.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>The findings from the risk characterization of benzene should be used
effectively in continuing to underwrite the basis for an EU Occupational
Exposure Limit of 1 ppm for benzene and during the forthcoming discussions
on the development of an Air Quality Standard for benzene.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>If considered necessary, the rapporteur will recommend further risk
reduction measures and, for the petroleum industry, this would mainly concern
gasoline. However, it is agreed by the European Commission and Member States
that any measures relating to gasoline will not be recommended until a
risk assessment report has been prepared for gasoline itself under the
Existing Substances Regulation.</LI>
