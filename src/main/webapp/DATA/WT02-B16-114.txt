The global market for energy and environmental technologies is estimated at $425 billion. Golden is working to ensure U.S. industry captures the lion's share of that market.<p>
        
To accomplish this, Golden collaborates with small and large companies, as well as universities, in cost-shared research and development (R&D) projects to develop and then to move proven technologies into the marketplace. <p>
        
Golden has approximately 200 active agreements with private sector organizations in almost every state and Mexico, which are funded through direct DOE financial assistance instruments such as grants or cooperative agreements. The total value of these projects is in excess of $500 million, including cost share by recipients and other parties.<p>

The DOE project funding is provided by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's (EE) end-sector programs, with most money and projects  sponsored by the Office of Utility Technologies.  However, Golden administers projects sponsored by all the EE Program Offices including the Industry, Buildings, Transportation, and Federal Energy Management Programs.<p>

Projects administered out of Golden are aimed at developing and advancing alternative energy options for the nation's energy portfolio.  Golden and NREL help develop and transfer technologies into the marketplace where they can be used by industry and consumers.  <p>
        
<H2>Examples of Golden's Cost-Shared Projects:</H2><p>

<h3>Domestic Projects</h3><p>

<b><a href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/sunlab">Solar Two</a>, Barstow, Calif.</b>

303/275-4775.<p>
        
<B>PV:BONUS:  Building Opportunities in the U.S. for Photovoltaics</B><br>
Accelerating the commercialization of building-integrated photovoltaics in residential, commercial and industrial applications.  Cost-shared with industry.  Total value -- $12 million. Contact:  James Spaeth, 303/275-4706.
        <p>
<B>Utility Wind Turbine Performance Verification Project</B><br> Establishing wind deployment and testing projects with host utilities to provide performance, operation and maintenance experience with commercial-prototype, utility-grade wind turbines.  Cost-shared with 
EPRI. Total value -- $6 million. Contact: Doug Hooker, 303/275-4780.<p>

<B>Minnesota Alfalfa-Biomass Project</B><br>
Developing an integrated alfalfa processing and biomass gasification energy system, lead by a farmer-owned cooperative.  Cost-shared 
with the Minnesota Valley Alfalfa Producers.  Total value --$200 million.  Contact: James Spaeth, 303/275-4706.<p>

<b>Electric Power Train, Baltimore, Md.</b><br>
     
Development and cost reduction of electronic controls and mechanical motor elements that comprise an electric vehicle power train.  Considered as highest priority to the success of future electric and hybrid electric vehicles.  Cost-shared with Northrop Grumman. Total value -- $20 million.  Contact: James Spaeth, 303/275-4706.<P>
     
<b>Electrochromic Windows Program</b><br>
     
Accelerating the development of electrochromic window products for commercial building applications.  Electrochromic windows, windows that change from clear to opaque by applying electricity, allow building occupants to control the amount of light entering into the building,  resulting in increased energy savings.  Cost-shared with Donnelly Corporation and Optical Coating Laboratory, Inc.  Total value  -- $3.4 million.  Contact: Heather Collins, 303/275-4730.<P>
