<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Summary of Current Models of Teaching</H3>

According to Shuell, 1996, current models of teaching and learning used in general education include such concepts as cognitive apprenticeship, reciprocal teaching, conceptual change teaching, and cooperative learning. These concepts share some commonalties, in that they assume that:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Learning is a social process<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Competence involves expertise rather than native ability<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Learning, at least meaningful learning, is constructive and self regulating<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Classroom activities should reflect real - world learning rather than traditional academic tasks.<BR>
</UL>
Each of these ideas appear to be congruent with the ideas of inclusive education.<BR>

<A NAME=Expect></A>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Teacher Expectations and Student Performance</H3>

One difficulty in teaching in an inclusion setting is allowing for the diverse abilities of the students involved, without decreasing one's expectations to such an extent that it becomes difficult for the child with a disability to progress to his or her fullest potential.  Thomas Good (1987) discusses the role of teacher expectations on teacher-student interactions and on student performance in general education. Some interesting points that can be applied to inclusion are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: Teacher expectations of a student lead to a behavior that makes the original erroneous belief come true. For example, if a teacher believes that a student is gifted, he or she is likely to treat the student in a particular way, and , in turn, the student is likely to progress at a more rapid rate than would have otherwise occurred.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Sustaining Expectations: This occurs when teachers do not see a student's potential and, therefore, treat the student in a particular way. It is likely that the student, in turn, will not progress to his or her fullest potential. This certainly has the potential to be problematic in students with disabilities who are in inclusion classrooms. Teacher understanding of this potential problem, consultation with special education team members, and overt cognitive attempts to avoid this may help to reduce the risk.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Brophy-Good Model (1970). This model explains how teachers communicate their expectations to students, and how students respond. The model states that:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> The teacher expects different types of behavior and achievement from different students.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Because of these varied expectations, the teacher behaves differently toward different students.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> This treatment communicates to the students what behavior and achievement the teacher expects from them and affects their self-concepts, achievement motivation, and levels of aspiration.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> If this treatment is consistent over time, and if the students do not resist or change it in some way, it will shape their achievement and behavior. High-expectation students will be led to achieve at high levels, whereas the achievement of low-expectation students will decline.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> With time, students' achievement and behavior will conform more and more closely to the behavior originally expected of them.
</OL>
<BR>
Good and Brophy researched this model and found 17 differences in the way that high achieving and low achieving students were treated in the classroom. These are:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Waiting less time for lows to answer
<LI> Giving lows answers or calling on someone else, rather than trying to improve lows' responses by giving clues or additional opportunities to respond. 
<LI> Giving inappropriate reinforcement: rewarding inappropriate behavior or incorrect answers by lows.
<LI> Criticizing lows for failure more often.
<LI> Praising lows less frequently for success.
<LI> Failing to give feedback to the public responses of lows.
<LI> Paying less attention to lows generally or interacting with them less frequently.
<LI> Calling on lows less frequently to answer questions.
<LI> Seating lows farther from the teacher.
<LI> Demanding less from lows.
<LI> Interacting with lows more privately than publicly and monitoring and structuring their activities more closely. 
<LI> Administering or grading tests and assignments differently in which highs but not lows are given the benefit of the doubt in borderline cases. 
<LI> Having fewer friendly interactions with lows, including less smiling and fewer other nonverbal indicators of support.
<LI> Giving briefer and less informative feedback to lows' questions.
<LI> Using less eye contact and other nonverbal communication of attention and responsiveness with lows.
<LI> Using effective by time-consuming methods with lows when time is limited.
<LI> Interrupting lows more frequently when they make reading mistakes.

<A NAME=Group></A>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Considerations for Group Work</H3>

Current teaching practice often includes group work. A variety of types of groups may be implemented, including <A HREF="../Coop/Coop.home">cooperative learning</A>, <A HREF="../CogAp/Cog.home">reciprocal teaching</A>, and <A HREF="IncConsider#Teaming">peer tutoring teams</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Fields (1995) has identified some of the sociodevelopmental aspects of group formation which may impact on the effectiveness of the teaching/learning group. Fields states that "An underlying philosophy of inclusion is that all students are different in some ways and alike in some ways. Teaching in an integrated class means recognizing similarities and differences among students and providing the necessary adaptations and support services within one class to serve all students." (Fields, 1995, p. 91). Therefore, formation of effective groups requires knowledge, planning, and monitoring on the part of the teacher.<BR>
<BR>
Stages of groups:
<OL>
<LI> Trust and acceptance
<LI> Orientation to the task
<LI> Organization to accomplish the task
<LI> Dealing with interpersonal conflicts and confusion
<LI> Development of a sense of cohesion and a free exchange of ideas
<LI> Interdependence and problem solving managed by the group itself as opposed to a leader (not always reached in all groups).
</OL>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Potential Problems for Group<BR>Formation in Inclusion</H4>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Acceptance</H4>
This will likely be affected by whether or not the students in the class have been involved in classroom settings with students with disabilities in the past. If this is the first experience, there is likely to be some difficulty in gaining acceptance and building trust. While it may seem wise to apprise the other group members of the situation of the student with a disability prior to his or her entry to the group, this may actually make the student with a disability feel excluded. Field recommends discussing topics such as individual differences with the entire class, including all students with disabilities, so that all students are included in the process. Presenting real life dilemmas to the class and allowing them, as a class or as a group, to struggle with the issue will help to facilitate acceptance. For example, deciding what type of field trip to take, given that one student is in a wheel chair and cannot negotiate steps, could be the basis of a class discussion which will lead to greater understanding and acceptance of the student with a disability.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Universality</H4>
As students accept each other, they begin to recognize common problems, and students are less likely to isolate the student with a disability. Through class and individual discussions, the teacher can help the students to understand the commonalties among them. Similarly, the teacher can help the students to understand that some of the techniques used by the students with disabilities, such as learning strategies or organizational strategies, may be beneficial to other students as well. In this way, overall teaching effectiveness can be improved upon.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Task Differences</H4>
This area presents one of the greatest challenges for the teacher.  The general educator must work as a team with the special educator and any support personnel involved (such as therapists or psychologists), in devising group tasks that provide an appropriate challenge for all students. Group tasks that provide opportunity for several different roles at multiple levels are beneficial. Throughout the year, the teacher should emphasize the importance of each person's contribution to a task or class discussion.  As the group develops interdependence, the group itself may be able to contribute possible ways that all students can participate in a task.  For example, in determining what role a student who is visually impaired may play in a group project, all members of the group should be involved as the student discusses his or her abilities and what he or she is able to contribute.<BR>
<BR>
One teacher reported on a fifth grade classroom in which one student (Jen) had Rett's syndrome and was extremely limited in movement, cognitive function, and communication (she could only communicate yes no using signs when presented with a simple question). However, this teacher found ways for Jen to be included in nearly all classroom activities. For example, when the class learned about protozoa, the teacher was unable to find a simple enough book for the Jen, so she had a small group of students make up a children's book on protozoa for Jen. In preparing the book, the students; learning was reinforced, Jen's value as class member was reinforced, and the book was used to move toward some of Jen's individual goals. Similarly, with the help of the speech/language pathologist, the teacher began utilizing students with reading problems to read aloud to Jen. This provided authentic practice for the reader, and worked toward Jen's educational goals of looking at pictures in books. As students learned about various microscopic organisms, the teacher projected the specimens on the wall with a projecting microscope, and students were able to explain what they were seeing to Jen (Richardson, 1994).

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Time Demands</H4>
One reality of the classroom is the amount of time that each activity and each student demands. When this is coupled with having one or more students with disabilities in the classroom, it may result in increased time spent with the student with a disability. This may be resented by other class members or their parents. By working with the other teaching team members, the general education teacher can use these issues as a teaching method for the entire class. For example, when teaching a student with behavioral problems, the teacher can address not only the problem behaviors, but can teach the class how to deal with difficult behaviors in the way he or she models appropriate responses.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Authentic Learning</H4>
One trend in general education is toward authentic learning, whereby students learn through situations that are realistic and relevant to them. This may be difficult, or overlooked, when teaching students with disabilities. However, some interests, such as hobbies, music, television shows, or sporting events, may be relevant to students with and without disabilities. While authentic learning is considered by some to allow for deeper understanding and greater motivation in general education, it can also be used to promote sharing and group cohesion in an inclusion setting.<BR>

<A NAME=Recip></A>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Reciprocal Teaching</H3>

Reciprocal teaching may be applied to inclusive classrooms, particularly to situations with students with learning disabilities. (Click <A HREF="../CogAp/cogexam#RT">here for more information on reciprocal teaching</A>.)<BR>
<OL>
<LI> The structure of reciprocal teaching may help students to learn metacognitive skills through modeling<BR>
<BR>
<LI> The student that takes on the role of the teacher learns how to facilitate other students to learn without simply giving answers -- a problem often seen in teaming.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> The students generally work in small groups, which may increase acceptance of the student with a disability.
</OL>
<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME=Coop></A>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Cooperative Learning</H3>

Cooperative learning may be a beneficial approach in the inclusion classroom.  (Click <A HREF="../Coop/Coop.home">here for more information on cooperative learning</A>.)  Some specific advantages of cooperative learning in an inclusion setting are:<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Promotes active learning by all students, and students are held accountable for their work, so that the student with a disability would not be a passive observer or dependent upon other students for answers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> The use of small groups promotes interpersonal skills, and may promote acceptance of the student with a disability.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Cooperative learning allows for increased communication between group members, which is frequently an Individualized Education Plan goal for students with learning disabilities.
