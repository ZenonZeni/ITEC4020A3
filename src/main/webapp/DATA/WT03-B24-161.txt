Under difficult circumstances for fund raising, many biotech companies are
visiting Japan to secure corporate partners for the Asian market. This strategy
is oftentimes preferred to giving up the worldwide right to a multi-national
company, for the biotech company can keep at least the North American and
European rights intact rendering it more flexibility for future business
development. Such being the case, the biotech company needs a quick cash
injection and a reasonable R&D support from a Japanese partner to maintain
its business.<BR>
<BR>
The biotech company will first approach the top-tier full fledged companies.
It would be the ideal partner if a deal can be finalized in a reasonable
time scale, which is an exception rather than a rule. The biotech company
cannot afford such a time consuming lengthy negotiations.<BR>
<BR>
The second target is a company belonging to the medium-tier group. The biotech
companies will have a difficulty to find a right window for these relatively
unknown companies. These companies sometimes lack adequate capacity for
due diligence and sophisticated product development capabilities. Despite
a possibility of a quick deal with a company in this group, the biotech
company may have to face with claims for misrepresentation or non-performance
later on.<BR>
<BR>
The third choice is a new comer to the pharmaceutical industry. Some of
these companies have extremely flexible strategy and can move relatively
quickly. They are oftentimes cash rich and eager to license innovative technologies
to consolidate their pharmaceutical business platform. Sometimes they also
lack due diligence capabilities and are yet to establish the development
and marketing forces. Hence their strong motivation to secure their own
development or marketing partners. In many cases, these parners are the
top-tier companies in Japan.<BR>
<BR>
In consideration of the above situation, <A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> has recently launched a new fund (<A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A>
License Fund #1) with some of these cash rich new comers. <A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> will help
them (the partners) with the due diligence and provide a sizable option
fee for Asian rights to a biotech company in a much shorter time scale than
it would take to negotiate with a traditional Japanese company. <A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> will
also support the research, whenever appropriate, to add value to the technology
in concern to meet with requirements from Japanese companies. The partners
have 3 months' exclusive evaluation period and <A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> is free to negotiate
with any other party when this period expires. The license fee will be eventually
paid in by the partners or third parties to be identified. The biotech company
can keep a majority portion of the license fee, depending on its relative
contribution.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> is extremely well connected to the decision makers of the Japanese
pharmaceutical companies and is updated with precise needs of most of the
companies. Therefore, <A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> can afford a needs-oriented business leading
to a very high success rate of the partnering. This is evidenced by the
<A HREF="../Companies/sosei.html">Sosei's</A> track record as an efficient deal maker.<P>
