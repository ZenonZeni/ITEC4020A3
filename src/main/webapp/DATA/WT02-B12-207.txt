 President Clinton on July 29, 1996 vetoed the TEAM Act, which

would have eased legal restrictions on &quot;employee involvement&quot;

programs in nonunion settings.  On July 10, the Senate, by a vote

of 53-46, approved the employer-backed TEAM Act (S 295), which

was strongly opposed by the AFL-CIO.  An identical bill narrowly

passed the House in September, 1995 by a vote of 221-202.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In December 1992, the NLRB ruled

that Electromation had violated the NLRA by establishing five

committees in which five or six employees and one or two managers

discussed workplace issues.  The Teamsters, who were trying to

organize Electromation, charged that the company had established

an employer-sponsored labor organization to avoid unions.  The

TEAM Act would have clarified when employers can establish worker-management

teams.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">California</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">.

 The federal-state Targeted Industries Partnership Program (TIPP)

was again active in California fields in 1996.  TIPP was created

in 1992 to promote cooperation between state and federal agencies

that enforce labor laws in the garment and agricultural industries.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The goals of the TIPP program

are to level the playing field for all employers, to protect vulnerable

workers, and to ensure that appropriate taxes are collected. 

In 1994, it was estimated that California's underground or untaxed

economy involved $70 to $170 billion in annual transactions, and

that the US underground economy involved $500 to $800 billion

per year.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">There are reported to be growing

tensions between California and DOL TIPP teams.  On August 30,

1996, the US Department of Labor presented its first regional

Agricultural Employer of the Year award to tomato grower Harry

Singh &amp; Sons, in recognition of the farm's construction of

barracks housing in 1990 for 325 farm workers.  In 1991, the workers

were charged $16.50 a week for bunk beds in a communal sleeping

room -- and $44.80 a week for three hot meals a day.  Singh &amp;

Sons farms employs 400 to 900 workers to farm 700 acres.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In granting the award, DOL noted

that Singh has not been cited for even a minor violation since

1978.  However, the California Labor Commissioner in August 1996

charged that Singh violated state labor law, and owed more than

$1 million in overtime pay to workers--under California law, farm

workers must receive overtime pay after 10 hours daily or 60 hours

weekly.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In 1996, DOL threatened to invoke

the hot-goods rule of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Section 12a,

to seize farm commodities produced in violation of federal wage

and hour laws.  The threat was made as the garlic, onion and strawberry

industries continue to employ large numbers of children.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Under the hot-goods rule, DOL

can seize goods that were produced with oppressive child labor

or on farms that repeatedly violate minimum wage laws.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Cal/OSHA announced that it is

making growers jointly liable with contractors for on-the-job

injuries if the employer has any supervisory or control function

over the contractor's employees on his farm.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Los Angeles Times reported

that there is growing tension between federal and state inspectors

on TIPP teams assigned to the garment industry.  TIPP has made

2,000 inspections, and levied $15 million in fines, in an industry

with 6,000 registered sewing contractors and 158,000 employees.

 In the garment industry, California TIPP inspectors are beginning

to do more inspections without their federal partners.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">An IRS agriculture enforcement

team has discovered cases in the Fresno area in which growers

paid farm labor contractors only workers' wages of $5 per hour

and no commission to cover the cost of required social security,

unemployment insurance and workers' compensation taxes.  There

are an estimated $200 million in unpaid agriculture employment

taxes in the San Joaquin Valley, and IRS section 3505 permits

the IRS to levy penalties against growers who knowingly pay farm

labor contractors too little for them to pay employment taxes.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Since California began requiring

that FLCs seeking to renew their licenses include IRS Form 8821

to assure that they have paid appropriate employment taxes, the

IRS has determined that 117 of 279 FLCs renewing their licenses,

or 42 percent, owed payroll taxes.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A bill to make farmers liable

for violations committed by FLCs they <B>use</B> failed several

times in the California Legislature, in 1993 by a vote of 42 to

25.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Under California law, employees

earning less than twice the minimum wage must be provided with

tools at no charge by their employers.  Employees can use their

own tools at work only if they sign a statement saying that they

prefer their own to employer-provided tools.</FONT></TT>
