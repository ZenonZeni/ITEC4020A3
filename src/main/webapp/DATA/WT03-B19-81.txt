Hot Topic -- Invisibility

<h3> Have you ever felt invisible? </h3>

<p>
Have you ever been somewhere where and had non-disabled people step
in front of you in line and ignore you? Have salespeople in stores looked
through you and asked others what they wanted? How about waiters or like
people asking a non-disabled companion what <i>you</i> want? AND what do
you do about this kind of treatment when it happens?<br>
<p>
<p>
<h3>It's MY money</h3>
Sometimes when shopping, the store clerks give MY change back to
whoever 
is with me.  Despite using a wheelchair, I am capable of handling
my 
finances. (Many people don't seem to agree with this).
<p>
  First, I only go 
shopping with my mother or sister who understand this frustration. 

Usually, they will speak up before I do (which doesn't take long).
Many an 
embarassed clerk has apologetically given ME the change.
<p>
  My fantasy is 
to announce LOUDLY, "Excuse me, I think that's MY money, where's
the 
manager?" 
<p>
Probably a better way to handle this is to discreetly speak to 
the manager and express my concerns as it isn't just me people do
this 
to.

<h3>Two-way street</h3>
<p>
It is a two way street.
<p>
I was at a concert recently, enjoying from outside the grounds, as
the 
price was right --free.  The crowd was diverse, ranging from middle

age, middle class rock music lovers to the native inhabitants of
the 
area; homeless, mentally ill, and free spirits of the nineties.
<p>
A friend of mine, a leader in the disabled community I believe,
came by 
and joined me.  We were enjoying the music when an obviously
mentally 
disabled man came by and started a casual conversation with me
about 
music and how his uncle had taught him how to play a guitar "just
like 
Carlos Santana" who was playing in the background.  I told the
fellow 
how lucky he was and wished I had musical ability.
<p>
After the man left, my friend, who had sat nervously through the 
conversation, quietly muttered to me "if you  ignore them, they
will 
leave".
<p>

My reply was "I know the feeling"

<h3>Often ignored</h3>
<p>
I'm hearing-impaired and very often ignored
if--as happens too often--I can't hear the other person.  Sometimes
I've had
to have someone with me to "interpret" what's going on, since my
disabilities (hearing and vision among others) often leave me
several steps
removed from normal social interaction.

<h3>Important issue</h3>
<p>
Thank you Mainstream, this is a question of importance.  Not only
to
people "living" with disabilities as individuals but also as an
under
utilized group in today's society.  It really makes me wonder if
society
is so stupid they feel they can afford to look over such a
vigorous,
talented, hard-working segment of the population.
<p>
Have I ever felt invisible?  The short answer is YES, YES and YES
again.
<p>
I no longer allow myself to feel invisible, as an individual that
is.  I
ceased to allow that to happen to me one evening when I was out
Christmas shopping.  I was in my wheelchair looking at a rack of
blouses, wondering if my daughter would like a particular blouse I
was
looking at.
<p>
  When what to my wondering surprise should happen. Some
lady, and I used the term loosly, decided I was in her way and
simply
moved me.  As the realization of what happened filtered down my
chimney,
like a volcanic eruption, up came the smoke of anger.  I let that
person
have what for and ended by asking her if I had been standing there
would
she have picked me up body and bones to move me or would she have
excused herself and asked me to move.  I also made sure that her
ears,
and everybody else's within hearing range, understood that moving
my
chair is the equalivent of pushing someone out of your way which
equals
physical assault.
<p>
  She walked away mightly embarrassed and I like to
think it will be a long long time before she attempts such actions
again.
<p>
Do I now feel invisible?  The short answer alas, is once again YES,
YES
and YES again.  Not as an individual, but as a part of the whole. 
This
morning I heard a commentary by one of the editors or Mainstream
magazine.  Apologies to this person that I did not get her name. 
It was
my first introduction to Mainstream and I felt so proud that
finally
there is a voice to give credence to my complaint that sports
events for
people with disabilities are being ignored.
<p>
At the Barcelona Olympic games the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation
showed two events for athelets with disabilities.  Now you can
imagine
that watching Jeff Adams win his race set my heart racing.  This
year I
watched the Atlanta Olympics and had my dreams dashed as the close
of
the games came, and not even a mention of athelets with
disabilities. 
Not even a mention of the following Paralympics.  How sad I was. 
How
invisible I felt.  
<p>
I wonder if Donovan Bailey and Jeff Adams raced each other in an
exhibition race or if Shaqille O'Neil participated in a game of
wheelchair basketball, how fast would the media be rushing off with
their commentators and cameras to cover such an event.  Maybe we
should
be encouraging our favourite big name atheletes to perform in such
events to promote the "abilities" of our favourite, not so big name
athelets.

<h3>Don't like it</h3>
<p>
Yes, I was in a restaurant with my  mother. The waitress asked my
mother, `what does she want'. My mother answered back, `ask her
yourself'. I don't like the feeling of being invisible.

<h3>Ultimate fantasy</h3>
<p>
I have felt invisible so many times I really thought I was. So I
decided to try my ultimate fantasy -- the girl's locker room. Boy
was I mistaken. Can you loan me two grand so I can make bail?

<h3>Get involved</h3>
<p>
I've been treated exactly like all of the examples in the article that
linked me here. I am blind, deaf in one ear, use a wheelchair and have
diabetes and a transplant. I work full time at an independent living center
and pay taxes.  I still get ignored in stores and patted on the head every
now and then or told how brave I am when I'm just sitting in the sun or
pissing. I guess the sun can cause cancer and the chlorine in water can be
dangerous, but I don't see myself being any braver than the sunbather next
to me or the guy at the next urinal.  I believe the only thing that will
change this is for PWD to do a few things:
<p>
1. Get out and about as much as possible. Get out so much that we become
part of the scenery.
<p>
2. Make the changes in the man-made environment so that we can get out and
work, play and/or just be bums like everyone that thinks themselves not to
 be one us.
<p>
3. Move into positions of power and decision making. Not just advisory, but
 real power positions.
<p>
4. Organize! Organize! Organize! We have plenty of numbers, but not much
 power or money. Let's use the numbers we have. We can change the course 
of local, state and national elections.
<p>
5. Don't get in the way of or criticize any PWD fighting for their rights.
 We already have enough ignorance, malice and enemies to fight.
<p>
6. Everytime you have the energy to do so, don't just take it.
<p>
7. Join like minded organizations like low income groups and unions.
<p>
8. Get involved in the health care fight.  It might save our lives.
<p>
Thanks
