<a name="3"></a><b>1) Name of food</b>
<p>
If a name prescribed by law exists, it shall be used, and may be qualified by other words which make it more precise. (For fish, Schedule 1 of the Regulations should be consulted; for melons and potatoes sold as such, the variety must be included; for vitamins, the name should be that used in the table given below <a href="#vits">[See Table of Vitamins below]</a> except that folacin may be called "folic acid" and viatmin K shall be called "vitamin K").<br>

<a name="4"></a><b>2) List of ingredients</b>
<p>
Heading:
<p>
The list of ingredients should be headed or preceded by "ingredients" (or a heading which includes the word "ingredients").
<p>

b) if an ingredient is reconstituted from concentrated or dehydrated form during preparation of the food, it may be positioned according to its weight before concentration or dehydration;<br>
c) if a food is to be reconstituted during use by the addition of water, its ingredients may be listed in order after reconstitution provided there is a statement "ingredients of the reconstituted product" or "ingredients of the ready to use product" or similar indication;<br>
d) if a product consists of mixed fruit, nuts, vegetables, spices or herbs and no particular one of these ingredients predominates significantly by weight, the ingredients may be listed in any order provided that for foods consisting entirely of such a mixture the heading includes "in variable proportion' or other words indicating method of listing and for other such foods the relevant ingredients are accompanied by such a statement.
<p>
Names of ingredients:
<p>
The name of an ingredient shall be<br>
a) the name which would be used if the ingredient were sold as a food, including, if appropriate, either "irradiated" or "treated with ionising radiation" (other appropriate indications must be given if a consumer could be misled by its omission); or<br>
b) the generic name given in the following table and meeting the specified conditions:

If sold otherwise than to the ultimate consumer, as an alternative, the details may be on relevant trade documents (except that the name of the food, its appropriate durability indication and the name and address of manufacturer, packer or seller must appear on the outermost packaging).
<p>
b) For those products which may omit certain details (food which is not prepacked and fancy confectionery products and certain food sold at catering establishments as detailed above in 6) a) and e)) are sold to the ultimate consumer, the details which are required shall appear on a label attached to the food or on a menu, notice, ticket or label discernable to the purchaser at place where he chooses the food.  Where the information is given on a menu, etc., if the food contains (or may contain) irradiated ingredients this shall be indicated using the words "irradiated" or "treated with ionising radiation" accompanying the reference to the ingredient.  In the case where irradiated dried substances normally used for seasoning are used in a catering establishment, an indication that food sold in the establishment contains (or may contain) those irradiated ingredients is sufficient.
<p>
c) For food which is not prepacked and fancy confectionery products (as detailed above in 6) a) above) are sold otherwise than to the ultimate consumer, the details which are required shall appear on a label attached to the food or on a menu, notice, ticket or label discernable to the purchaser at place where he chooses the food, or in commercial documents which accompany the food (or were sent before or at the time of delivery of the food).

Field of vision:<br>
When required to be marked with one or more of the following, the required information shall appear in the same field of vision:<br>
a) name of food;<br>
b) appropriate durability indication;<br>
c) indication of alcohlic strength by volume;<br>
d) the cautionary words in respect of raw milk (see 7) c) above);<br>
e) the warning required on products consisting of skimmed milk with non-milk fat (see 7) d) above);<br>
f) statement of net quantity.<br>
The requirements of b), c) and f) do not apply to foods falling within the section on small packages and certain bottles above (see 5) d) above).
<p>

<p>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><a name="10"></a><b><h4>B.   Claims</h4></b></FONT>

The following claims in the labelling or advertising of a food are prohibited:<p>
1) A claim that a food has tonic properties (except that the use of the word tonic in the description "Indian tonic water" or quinnine tonic water" shall not of itself constitute this claim).<p>
2) A claim that a food has the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease or any reference to such a property (except that the use of the claim described below under "claims relating to foods for particular nutritional uses" shall not of itself constitute this claim).
<p>
The following claims in the labelling or advertising of a food are only permitted where the conditions specified in the Regulations are met (only summaries of the conditions are given here and the Regulations should be consulted for full details).  When considering whether a claim is being made, a reference to a substance in an ingredients' list or in any nutrition labelling shall not constitute a claim.
<p>
1) Claims relating to foods for particular nutritional uses (i.e. a claim that a food is suitable, or has been specially made, for a particular nutritional purpose which includes requirements either of people whose digestive process or metabolism is disturbed, or of people who, because of special physiological conditions obtain special benefit from the controlled consumption of certain substances, or of infants (0 - 12 months) or young children (1 - 3 years) in good health):<br>
the food must fulfil the claim; the label must indicate the aspects of compostion or process which give the food its particular nutritional characteristics; the label must give the prescribed nutrition labelling and may have additional relevnat information; when sold to the ultimate consumer, the food  must be prepacked and completely enclosed by its packaging.
<p>
2) Reduced or low energy value claims (i.e. a claim that a food has a reduced or low energy value except that the presence of the words "low calorie" for a soft drink and in accordance with the requirements below on misleading descriptions does not constitute such a claim):<br>
foods claimed to have a reduced energy value must have energy no more than three-quarters of a similar food with no such claim (unless the food is an intense sweetener either on its own or mixed with another food but still significantly sweeter than sucrose ); foods claimed to have a low energy value should usually have a maximum energy of 167 kJ (40 kcal) per 100 g (or 100 ml) and per normal serving (unless the food is an intense sweetener either on its own or mixed with another food but still significantly sweeter than sucrose ); in the case of an uncooked food, the claim must be in the form "a low energy or calorie or Joule food".
<p>
3) Protein claims (i.e. a claim that a food, other than one intended for babies or young children which satisfies the conditions for 1) above, is a source of protein):<br>
a reasonable daily consumption of the food must contribute at least 12 g of protein; foods claimed to be a rich or excellent source of protein must have at least 20% of their energy value provided by protein and in other cases at least 12%; the label must give the prescribed nutrition labelling.
<p>
4) Vitamin / mineral claims (i.e. a claim that a food, other than one intended for babies or young children which satisfies the conditions of 1) above, is a source of vitamins/minerals; a claim is not made when a name includes the name of one or more viatamins/minerals and the food consists solely of vitamins and/or minerals and certain other substances and when mineral claims are made relating to a low or reduced level of minerals):<br>
claims may only be made with respect to vitamins or minerals in the following table (using the name in the table); where a) the claim is not confined to named vitamins or minerals then, if the food is claimed to be a rich or excellent source of vitamins or minerals, it must contain at least one half of the recommended daily amount (RDA) of two or more of the vitamins or minerals listed in the quantity reasonably expected to be consumed in one day or, otherwise, at least one-sixth; where b) the claim is confined to named vitamins or minerals, the conditions of a) must apply to each named vitamin or mineral;  for foods to which nutrition labelling relates, the label must carry a statement of the % RDA of any vitamin or mineral involved in the claim in a quantified serving of  the food or per portion (if number of portions in pack is stated); for food supplements or waters other than natural mineral waters, the label must carry a statement of the % RDA of any vitamin or mineral involved in the claim in either a quantified serving of  the food or, if prepacked,  per portion, and, if prepacked, the number of portions in the pack is to be stated);
<a name="vits"></a><p>
<img src="./la-vits.gif"><br>
<p>
<p>
5) Cholesterol claims (i.e. a claim relating to the presence or absence of cholesterol):<br>
the food must have a maximum of 0.005% cholesterol except that if it is higher than this figure a claim may be made if the claim relates to the removal of cholesterol from, or its reduction in, the food if the claim is made a) as part of an indication of the true nature of the the food, b) as part of an indication of the treatment of the food, within the list of ingredients, or d) as a footnote in respect of a prescribed nutrition labelling; the claim must not include any suggestion of benefit to health because of its level of cholesterol; the food shall be marked with the prescribed nutrition labelling.
<p>
6) Nutrition claims (i.e. a claim not dealt with under items 1) - 5) above):<br>
the food must be capable of fulfilling the claim; the food shall be marked with the prescribed nutrition labelling.
<p>
7) Claims which depend on another food (i.e. a claim that a food has a particular value or confers a particular benefit):<br>
the value or benefit must not be derived wholly or partly from another food intended to be consumed with the food.

<p>
All amounts:<br>
a) to be given per 100g or 100 ml;<br>
b) may, in addition, be given per quantified serving or per portion (if number of portions in pack is stated);<br>
c) to be the amount contained in the food as sold except that, where detailed preparation instructions are given, they may be the amounts after such preaparation (and this must be expressly indicated);<br>
d) to be averages (taking into account seasonal variation, patterns of consumption, etc.) based on i) the manufacturer's analysis of the food, ii) a calcualtion from the actual average values of the ingredients used in the preparation of the food, and/or iii) a calculation from generally established and acepted data
<p>
In calculating the energy value the following conversion factors shall be used:<br>
<ul>
<li>1 g carbohydrate (excluding polyols) = 17 kJ (4 kcal)
<li>1 g polyols = 10 kJ (2.4 kcal)
<li>1 g protein = 17 kJ (4kcal)
<li>1 g fat = 37 kJ (9 kcal)
