Dear candidate:</H2>

Medical Necessity</H1></CENTER>

<H2>	Over the past 20 years, thirty-seven states have passed legislation
recognizing marijuana's therapeutic value.  Iowa enacted a law allowing
doctors to prescribe marijuana in 1979.  See Iowa Code §§ <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(4)(m),
<A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(7) and <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>(7)(a).  To understand the history of this legislation
and the need to amend current state law, a brief review of some national
court decisions is enlightening.
<P>	In 1976, a glaucoma patient by the name of Bob Randall was brought to trial
for growing marijuana plants on the balcony of his apartment in Washington,
D.C.  The court dismissed the charges, ruling that Randall's use of
marijuana was a "medical necessity."  Federal agencies began providing him
with marijuana, and Randall became the first American to receive marijuana
for the treatment of a medical disorder.
<P>	In 1981, a multiple sclerosis patient by the name of Sam Diana was
convicted for possessing marijuana in the state of Washington.  The
Washington Court of Appeals overturned the verdict and returned the case to
the lower court for retrial.  The Appeals Court ruled that "medical
necessity" was a valid defense.  On retrial, the Washington court concluded
that Diana was "not guilty by reason of medical necessity."
<P>	In 1989, a glaucoma patient by the name of Elvy Musikka was brought to
trial for cultivation of marijuana plants.  The court found Musikka not
guilty, ruling that her use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."
<P>	In 1991, a hemophilic patient by the name of Kenneth Jenks was brought to
trial for growing marijuana plants.  Kenneth received AIDS at a hospital
through a blood transfusion and transmitted the disease to his wife before
he knew that he had the disease.  Both Kenneth and Barbara were found guilty
at trial, but the Florida Court of Appeals reversed their convictions,
ruling that their use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."  The Florida
Supreme Court affirmed the reversal of their criminal convictions.
<P>	The federal government is the only legal supplier of medical marijuana in
the United States, and currently supplies marijuana to only 8 medical
patients, two of whom, George McMahon and Barbara Douglass, are Iowans.  In
1991, the federal government decided to stop accepting any new applications,
effectively nullifying all state laws allowing medical use of marijuana.
Without a federal license, no one can use medical marijuana by prescription
in the United States.
<P>	In 1994, Judge Irwin, an Iowa district court judge for Pottawattamie
County,  ruled that "medical necessity" is a recognized defense to
prosecution for possession of marijuana in the state of Iowa.  A copy of
that order is enclosed with this letter.
<P>	Iowa law says that possession of marijuana is legal when used for medicinal
purposes pursuant to rules of the board of pharmacy examiners.  We have
contacted the board of pharmacy examiners and discovered that the only rules
are those contained in the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration
and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
<P>	In 1991, an Iowan with multiple sclerosis by the name of Ladd Huffman was
approval by both the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement
Administration to receive medical marijuana.  However, his prescription was
never filled, because the federal government decided to stop accepting new
applications.  Ladd's application was one of 28 which was approved but was
never honored.
<P>	It is our position that seriously ill people who use marijuana for medicine
should not be arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial.  Seriously ill patients using marijuana as medicine should
be able to have a hearing with the board of pharmacy examiners, or other
qualified board.  If they have a legitimate medical necessity, they should
be certified and exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa.
The Iowa Legislature should amend current state law by immunizing certified
medical marijuana users from prosecution by the state.</H2>
