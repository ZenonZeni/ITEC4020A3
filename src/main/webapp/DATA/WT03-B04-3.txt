VIETNAM: Profits low

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam has 20 foreign banks with branch offices and 4 joint venture
banks.  Their average profit is around $350,000 each, a measely
figure even if it is double that of last year.  One bank, which the
State bank of Vietnam refused to identify, still hadn't made a profit
after four years of operations.  Foreign banks had raised their
share of loans to just over 15% but most still faced problems
loaning money to local firms because of "the inadequate legal
framework in Vietnam, unaudited accounting date and ... the poor
quality of credit information and risk evaluation."

VIETNAM: Beach sleaze

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam's coastal resort town of Nha Trang has turned to sleaze to boost
its economy.  It has a thriving sex industry that is attracting
foreign tourists by the score.  Police may have been able to crack
down on beach-front gambling and to have broken the power of the
local mafia but paedophilia and drug addition remains prevalent.
Even waitresses in state-run restaurants have been known to offer
their services along with the bacon and eggs.  Much to the
amusement of foreign backpackers and the disgust of more elderly
tourists.

VIETNAM: Party cells

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

With only 82 Communist Party cells in some 1500 foreign-invested
enterprises, Hanoi obviously feels there is room for improvement.
It has announced a  policy to put party cells (its a vital
ingredient for business development', one official told incredulous
investors) in every foreign-invested enterprise, whether it be a
joint-venture or 100% foreign owned.

With Party rules clearly stating that a member's first priority is
to the Party, it is difficult to understand the Party's
general-secretary Do Muoi who commented that cells would be
`beneficial' to foreign investors.  The question foreigners want
answered is to whom the Party cells answer to, the Party or the
employer ?

VIETNAM: Short-changed

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

The Golden Hanoi Hotel is no longer golden.  The very group of
Vietnamese architects that had originally approved its design have
now forced a redesign that reduces its number of rooms by a third.
Instead of the planned 150 rooms, the hotel can only have 110.
This has boosted the room cost by 40% to $168,000.  In addition,
the overall profitability of the hotel is severely reduced.

If the Hongkong investors oppose the redesign (construction is well
in hand), too bad.  The entire project would then be `handed over'
(confiscated might be a better description) to the Hanoi People's
Committee.  They would `compensate fairly' the foreign partner.
But as `fair' means one thing to the Vietnamese and another to
foreigners, it is only fair to say that the Golden Hanoi Hotel
could well be an $18.5m write-off.

LAOS: Tourists wanted

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Laos has finally awoken to the power of the tourist dollar.  To
facilitate entry, Loas will now issue visas an arrival at its
Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai borders.  This reverses a longstanding
policy that enforced strict visa controls in an effort to keep out
budget tourists.  Some 300,000 tourists visited Laos this year and
the new visa policy is expected to boost this figure to 500,000 in
1997.

The hotel and tourism industry, with $393 million in foreign
investment since 1988, is the second largest sector for investment
after electricity generation.

VIETNAM: Overcost

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Cost-accounting takes on a whole new meaning in Vietnam if a government
project to upgrade Phan Thiet port is anything to go by.
Originally budgeted at $2.6m, it is now nearly three times that and
still climbing.  So drastic is the blow-out that Phan Thiet
authorities are paying contractors only 80% of their work, even if
they have completed 100% of their contract.  The Asian Development
Bank has been asked to cover the $2m projected shortfall to
complete the entire project.  But ADB has shown a marked reluctance
to get involved in a project which is simply running out of control.

MANILA: Ny listing?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam Motor Corporation (VMC), the aggressive Philippines backed
assembler of foreign auto's in Vietnam, plans to list it's shares on the
American Stock Exchange.  It is not known whether VMC is actually
making a profit (turnover since 1992 is only $90m in total on sales
of only 5500 odd cars) Bankers and fund managers believe that a
NASDAQ, Australian or Asian listing might be more appropriate for a
company from such a vulnerable market.

If VMC was able to list in America, it would mean more excitement
than success.  Smaller diversified companies with Vietnamese assets
listed in Australia and New Zealand have not fared well, and
competition in Vietnam's car market is fast heating up.

VIETNAM: Stay healthy

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hospital rates in Vietnam are going up, so much so that one could get a
heart attack just thinking about them.  The rate in a major Saigon
hospital is currently $130/day.  That includes a phone, TV and
air-conditioning.  But Swiss company, Ketone, is aiming to build
it's own hospital where patients would be charged $150/day.  The
difference in price is attributed to foreign doctors being paid
$10000 a month.  That's 300 times what a local doctor now receives.
 The message to expatriates in all these figures is that getting
sick in Vietnam will soon be too expensive to contemplate.

VIETNAM: Cloudy Windows

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Microsoft's introduction of a Vietnamese version of its Windows 95
program has resulted in somewhat cloudy results.  Because people in
the north describe technical terms differently from those in the
south there is no uniform technology for all users.  This has left
many users confused and grumbling over the product's $110 retail
price.  Apparently, Microsoft launched its Vietnamese Window
without first ironing out all the bugs.  It wanted the product in
place before launching its Vietnamese Windows 97.  Mircosoft has
got just that plus legions of disappointed users who now look
forward to the real thing.

VIETNAM: Free labor

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

In a throwback to a time when Vietnam was fighting for its survival
against the Americans and French, the country's Vice Minister of
Finance Nguyen Sinh Hung wants to see the reintroduction of
compulsory labor on "projects of public interest".  He has
calculated (possibly without including himself) that if Vietnam's pool
of 30 million labours contributed one day a year to the notion for
"patriotic duties" the country would have an extra trillion dong to
play with.  Its a nice notion, and one that has worked well for the
Burmese for many years.  But in most countries such a concept is
simply called forced labor and while it certainly enhances a
citizen's patriotism, its does little for public relations.

VIETNAM: Degenerate

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bank officials have been described as a bunch of degenerates and
incompetents by none other than the official Communist Party
newspaper Nhan Dan.  A description that fits many state employees
in Vietnam.  The paper quoted State Bank chief Cao Si Kien who bemoaned
the lack of control over domestic banking activities.  He cited
operational shortcomings (a nice way of explaining away banks that
accept deposits but can't find the money at withdrawal time),
inadequate checks on loans (assets are a bit difficult to quantify
in Vietnam), and the employment of unqualified and `degenerate'
officials (loans are sometimes given on the basis of available sex
and entertainment).

VIETNAM: Expansion

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

The ADB is loaning Saigon Port $30m as part of a $40m upgrade.
Work has already begun on the three year project which will see
capacity increase by 25%.  Piers will be expanded, new warehouses
built, container facilities improved, and lighting, water, and
drainage revamped.

The upgrade will give Saigon Port an annual capacity of 9 million
tons, with a further 5 million tons added by 2010.

VIETNAM: Compensation set

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon's latest compensation rates of $2000 per square metre are
not yet set in stone, but the effect is the same since the formula
was handed down by the city's People's Committee.  Developers are
not supposed to pay compensation.  The Vietnamese party is supposed
to offer a clean site.  That is the theory.  The reality is
somewhat different.  To fast-track any property project, the
foreign developer usually has to compensate the residents.  It can
now figure in $2000 psm per resident in they invariable cost
over-runs that have to be paid to the Vietnamese partner.  That
doesn't necessarily mean that the resident will receive $2000.  The
Vietnamese partner could skim off up to 80% of the compensation.

VIETNAM: Chicken feed

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Farmers in the Mekeng Delta have been growing marijuana as chicken
feed.  As least that is what they told the police who confiscated
1000 kg of cannabis plants during a recent anti-drug sweep.  Police
found it hard to swallow the chicken feed claims of the two old
ladies who had been tending the crop for the past three years.  It
is believed that the cannabis is destined for the local market
where there has been a dermatic surge in drug-taking since Vietnam's
economic reforms really took hold in the last five years.

VIETNAM: Unlucky

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

It not easy to advertise a product in Vietnam.  What is bared in the
north could be quite acceptable in the south, or vice vera.  The
latest casualty in the marketing wars is Saigon's banning of
lottery promotions whereby when a customer buys a product he
becomes eligible for a prize.  The ban hit companies as divserse as
Motorola, Shell Oil and Toshiba.  However, the ban only applies in
the south.  In the north, foreign companies are continuing to use
lucky-draws as a marketing play.  Overall, they seem to be well
received by the average Vietnamese.

VIETNAM: History Rewritten

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Not to be outdone by the famous tunnels of Cu Chi, enterprising
tourist officials in Phuoc Tuy province near Saigon have unearthed
their own "tunnels' right under the old Australian army base at Nui
Dat.  This never-before-discovered tunnel network has been lauded
by old Viet Cong as having played a major role in their war against
the south.  Never mind that the 'tunnels' don't look 30 years old,
or that they are much bigger than the average Vietnamese.  The
'tunnels' look genuine and are certainly attracting tourists.  What
the tourists don't know is that they were dug this year so that
local tourist officials could cash in on the foreign visitors.

VIETNAM: Stumped

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Foreign vegetable growers in the cool highlands town of Dalat
continue to face astronomical transport costs in getting their
produce to market.  Cathay Pacific and Vietnam Airlines have the
cargo monopoly on the Saigon to Hongkong route.  Their extortionate
rates means that its cheaper to air freight produce from Sydney to
Hongkong.

Exporting to Europe is no different.  Air freight rates are 50%
higher out of Vietnam than out of Thailand where a variety of vegetables
are grown around the northern city of Chiang Mai.

The main foreign vegetable processor in Dalat, Bio-organics, is
shifting production to vegetables that can be shipped by sea.  It
is also branching into the growing of cut flowers that can
initially be sold locally.

VIETNAM: Power drive

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam is to build a new 17 billion kilowatt hours a year power plant
in its northern province of Son La.  With an expected completion by
2007 it will be three times bigger than Vietnam's existing largest hydro
project at Hoa Binh.  Official figures reveal that 50,000 people
will have to be relocated but the reservoir so created would swamp
forest and farmland in both Son La and Lai Chau provinces.  That
means that more than 100,000 people, mainly ethnic minorities,
could be affected.

The Son La project is seen as a key part of plans to boost power
output to 29 billion kwh by 2000, although total domestic
consumption could top 60 billion kwh within 10 years.  However, Son
La is set to cost in excess of $3.5 billion.  Vietnam doesn't have that
sort of money and foreign lending agencies are wary of funding
projects with so many obvious environmental concerns.

BURMA: Setting up shop in Burma

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

Angus B. Mitchell of international law firm Russin & Vecchi,
summarizes here in a percent Asian Initiates seminar in Rangoon the
sections of the economy open to foreign investment and the methods
by which a foreign investor may establish a presence in Myanmar.
For detailed information regarding any of the issues  discussed
below, please contact the author at Russin & Vecchi in Rangoon.

ESTABLISHING A PRESENCE IN MYANMAR

In 1988 the State Law and Order Restoration Council (the "SLORC")
passed the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (the "MFIL"), which
signalled a new era in Myanmar's economic development.  The MFIL
offers attractive incentives and guarantees competitive with those
of the neighbouring nations.  Though most sectors of the economy
are open to foreign investors, there are certain reservations.

A.    Permitted Areas for Investment

Some sector of economic activity are reserved to the State by
virtue of the State Economic Enterprises Law s. 3.  There are:

    -    extraction and sale of teak;

    -    exploration, extraction and sale of petroleum, natural gas and
production of by-products;

    -    exploration, extraction and export of pearls, jade and precious
stones;

    -    breeding and production of fish and prawns in fisheries;

    -    postal and telecommunications;

    -    air and railway transport;

    -    banking and insurance services;

    -    broadcasting and television services;

    -    exploration and extraction of metals and export of same;

    -    electricity generating services; and

    -    manufacture of products relating to security and defence which
the Government has prescribed by notification.

However, even in these sectors Myanmar citizens and foreign
investors alike may apply under s. 4 for a certificate allowing
them to undertake these activities.  In practice such permission
will often only be forthcoming where the proposed activity is to be
undertaken in a joint venture with the relevant State entity.

B.    Entry Vehicles for Doing Business in Myanmar

There are three primary methods for investors to establish a
presence in Myanmar :

1.    Appoint a Business Representative;

2.    Obtain a Permit to Trade and incorporate a company/register a
branch office;

3.    Apply to invest pursuant to the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law
(the "MFIL"), and then, if doing so as a company, obtain a Permit
to Trade and incorporate a company or register a branch office in
Myanmar.

Given the size and sector restrictions applying to MFIL
investments, most foreign investors utilize #2.  It is worth noting
immediately that 100% foreign ownership and control of companies
incorporated in Myanmar is permissible, and that where the State is
to have any form of equity interest in company it must be formed
pursuant to the Special Company Act 1950.  Finally, where a joint
venture is to be through a corporate vehicle, the provisions of
Myanmar's Partnership Act will obtain.

1. Business Representatives

Registration of a Business Representative

Though there are no provisions for "Representative Offices" as the
term may be understood in other countries, there is a procedure
under which a Myanmar citizen, or a branch office or company in
Myanmar, can be registered as the official Business Representative
of a foreign entity.

Who may be a "Business Representative"

The appointment of business representatives in Myanmar is governed
by the Ministry of Trade's Registration of Business Representatives
Order (order No. 2/89, or the "Business Representatives Order").
The Business Representatives Order defines a "Business
Representative" as:

1.    "an agent engaged in accepting indents and placing orders for
goods from the supplier abroad on a commission basis or any
business representative employed to do any business transaction for
any individual or organization abroad or to represent another
person in dealings with third person."

It also includes:

1.(1)    technical assistants and business consultants employed by a
foreign manufacturer or exporter;

1.(2)    products specialists, buying agents, technicians and business
consultants employed by foreign buyers who purchase Myanmar
products;

1.(3)    individuals who represent a foreigner in foreign trade and
who render services for the benefit of such foreigner; and

1.(4)    individuals having an established office in the Union of
Myanmar and representing a foreign company or organization or an
entrepreneur to act as business representative or to engage in
consultancy services or employee recruitment but not registered as
they are not governed by any existing law.

Section 3 stipulates that a person appointed a Business
Representative must be:

    (a)    a citizen of Myanmar;

    (b)    at least 18 years of age;

    (c)    not a service personnel of any State owned entity; and

    (d)    must possess appropriate qualifications.

It is also possible to appoint companies incorporated in Myanmar,
or branch offices registered in Myanmar, as a Business
Representative, even if these companies are foreign owned.

Powers of a Business Representative

As between the Business Representative and the Principal, the scope
of the permitted powers must be clearly delineated in the
Appointment Letter, which will be registered at the Ministry of
Trade.  Any liability for the acts of a Business Representative
will be determined with reference to the terms of the appointment
letter and will be governed by common law agency principles as
codified and modified by the Contract Act 1872.

Appointment Process

An application is filed for a certificate of registration, which
certificate will be valid for one year.  With 30 days notice prior
to the expiry of the certificate an application may be made to
extend the registration for a further year.  The appointment letter
must be certified as authentic by the Myanmar embassy in the
foreign principal's country.

Registration Fee

The registration fee is based on the proposed remuneration of the
representative.  This remuneration must fall within defined
parameters.  A Business Representative may earn agency commission
in foreign exchange, in which case the registration fee is kyat
10,000 payable in foreign exchange (which would be approx. $1800.00
at the official exchange rate of 5.75 kyat/ 1$).

Alternatively the Business Representative may earn a salary, in
which case registration fees are payable in local currency as
follows:

            Category            Registration Fee        Extension Fee

(1)    monthly salary of US$1,000    kyats 10,000            kyats 5,000
        and above

(2)   monthly salary of US$501        kyats 5,000            kyats 2,500
        to US$1,000

(3)   monthly salary of US$100        kyats 2,500            kyats 1,000
        to US$500

For reference the official exchange rate is pegged to the Special
Drawing Right (SDR) and the rate is currently approximately kyat
5.75 = $1US.  However, the market exchange rate, which can now be
legally obtained at a recognized new Exchange Centre, is about kyat
130 = $1US, so that for example the registration fee of kyat 2500
would cost only $20.

When is a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar necessary ?

Though  the definition of "business representative" noted above
gives some indication of the scope of activities contemplated for
Business Representatives, the point at which a company must
establish a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar remains
ill-defined.  The trigger appears to be when a company is "doing
business" in country.

2. Obtaining a Permit to Trade only

Section 27A of the Myanmar Companies Act requires that requires
that foreign companies obtain a Permit to Trade.  Formerly such
Permits were issued by the Ministry of Trade, whereas now they are
issued by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic
Development.

An application for a Permit must be in the prescribed form and will
require certain information regarding the investor and the
investment.  The Capital Structure Committee will consider
applications, and will stipulate a minimum capitalization amount.
There are certain prescribed minimum amounts, which are outlined
below for the 5 categories of Permits to Trade, but in some cases
the CSC may stipulate a higher amount in part based on
consideration of the company's expected expenditures during the
first year of operations.  One half of the stipulated amount must
be brought into the country before the Permit will be issued, and
the balance must follow within one year.

Following are the categories:

    i.     Manufacturing             kyat 1,000,000

    ii.    Trading                   kyat 500,000

    iii.   Services                  kyat 300,000

    iv.    Hotel/Tourism             kyat 300,000

    v.     Banking/Finance/Insurance kyat 300,000

As the official exchange rate is approximately kyat 5.75 - US$1 the
effect is that, for example, a requirement to import 300,000 will
actually require that the investor bring in roughly $53,000.  These
funds will be transferred into the investors foreign currency
account, and can be withdrawn in foreign currency equivalent
Foreign Exchange Certificates ("FEC's") to meet local expenses.  Up
to 75% can then be used to open an LC and thus in effect to bring
capital :in kind".

It is important to note that the company will be restricted to
activities which fall within the purview of its Permit to Trade
category, and that this Permit to Trade category must gybe with
stated objects of incorporation of the company.  Whereas formerly
companies would adopt "kitchen sink" objects clauses which
contemplated every conceivable manner of activity, now companies
are restricted to a list of objects issued by the Registrar of
Companies for companies in the relevant category of Permit to
Trade.  Companies must choose a limited number of the objects
clauses on this official list.

Additionally, whereas previously the categories of Permit to Trade
were tiered and inclusive, such that a manufacturing company could
engage in trading and services, and a trading company could engage
in services, now each category of Permit to Trade is distinct.  For
example, a manufacturing company may not engage in trading or
services, but must instead incorporate a distinct company and
obtain a distinct Permit to Trade for that purpose.  However,
companies may engage in what might be termed "downstream or
upstream" operations directly related to the activities
contemplated in their Permit.  Thus a manufacturing company could
engage in the retail sale of its own products and could import the
raw materials necessary for production.  That company could not,
however, participate in trading of unrelated goods.

Please note that in many sectors the economy the investor will need
to submit a licence fro the relevant Ministry as part of the Permit
to Trade application.

Once the Permit to Trade has been issued the investor can proceed
with the incorporation of a company or registration of a branch
office.  These application must again be in the prescribed form,
and require information on the shareholders, directors etc.

3. The MFIL

Investment under the MFIL always merits consideration because of
the generous tax and export/import incentives, and the explicit
guarantees regarding repatriation and nationalization, for which
MFIL investors are eligible.  However, there are certain listed
areas of permitted investment, certain minimum thresholds for MEIL
investors and MFIL has certain objectives to be considered when
assessing an application, including:

    - promotion and expansion of exports

    - exploitation of natural resources which require heavy investment

    - acquisition of high technology

    - supporting and assisting production and services requiring high
capital

    - opening up of more employment opportunities

    - development of works which would save energy consumption

    - regional development

In the results trading companies, for example, will not generally
be eligible for MFIL incentives.  By law it is never mandatory to
invest under the MFIL, but as a matter of policy companies
investing in certain sector of the economy might be asked to submit
the comprehensive MFIL proposals even if they do not want the
incentives that the MFIL offers.  It would be a rare case however
where an eligible company did not want to avail itself of the
MFIL's benefits.

Under the MFIL, foreign investment can occur in the form of 100%
foreign-owned venture, or in a joint venture with a Burmese entity
or individual.  If wholly foreign owner the investment can occur in
the form of a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a limited
company; if a joint venture, at least 35% of the joint venture
equity capital must be foreign capital.

MFIL applications require detailed information which must be
complied and submitted in a prescribed form.  Information required
includes information as to the investment participants (including
bank references and other information as to financial standing),
the investment structure, the magnitude, nature, division and
timing of capital contributions, the input requirements (foreign
exchange, personnel, power, etc.) and output projections for the
business, and any draft agreements (such as leases, contracts with
relevant Ministries, etc.) relating to  the project.

MFIL applications will be vetted and forwarded to the Myanmar
Investment Commission (the MIC") for review.  The MIC's members
include all Ministers whose portfolio's could be said to related to
commerce, industry to commerce, industry or finance.  When the MIC
has issued its recommendation regarding the application it will
forward it to the Cabinet for final consideration.  This
requirement that the powerful Cabinet explicitly consider and issue
its approval for issuance of an MFIL Permit is an important
distinction from certain other regional nations lacking such a
unitary central authority.  Such a "seal of approval" can greatly
expedite future dealings with government officials, provided always
that the matter at issue was explicitly contemplated in the MFIL
application materials.

When an MFIL Permit is granted the investor may then establish a
corporate presence in Myanmar pursuant to the steps noted above in
#2 if this is the chosen investment vehicle.

VIETNAM: Success is a mind's game

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

FT : - For a country that for decades learned more from the
text-books of Marx than the market economy, Vietnam is doing
remarkably well.

Group domestic product growth is around 8 per cent, mainly on the
back of rapid growth in construction, increased exports and
industrial growth.  Saigon, the country's engine of growth, grew by
almost 15 per cent, although there are signs that Hanoi and the
north is catching up.

"The main thing is staying on course in terms of macro-economic
management," says Bradley Babson, resident representative of the
World Bank.

But despite the past four years of successes, Vietnam has reached
an economic crossroads.  Inflation, which in 1988 raged at about
300 per cent, was brought down to 5.2 per cent by 1993.

However, consumer prices have increased ominously and economists
fear that the indicator could climb back up to alarming levels on
the back of rapid economic growth unless the trend is checked.

Although domestic savings accounted for some 17 per cent of growth
this year, far above the paltry 7.4 per cent recorded in 1990,
economists say that this is still too far below average levels in
the region and compares unfavourably to that of China, where the
rate is about 35 per cent.

Although the fruits of doi moi are evident in the main cities -
where cars are becoming more common and many residents have been
busily converting their homes into mini-hotels or small shops - the
countryside lags far behind.  Since agriculture employs more than
70 per cent of the workforce and accounts for more than 50 per cent
of total export volume, this could act as a drag on growth.

However, the economists sound greatest alarm over investment
inflows, which, though increasing, will not be enough to sustain
industrialisation.

The World Bank, normally upbeat on Vietnam, has in its latest
report tempered its praise with a warning that Vietnam must
demonstrate more enthusiasm for developing the nascent private
sector if growth is to be sustained.

"Despite the success of state enterprise-led industrialisation
since 1991, a strategy based on developing large, capital-intensive
state enterprises, protected from foreign and domestic private
competition and concentrated in selected `strategic' sectors, would
not deliver the kind of industrialisation Vietnam needs," said the
World Bank report.

Vietnam's private sector is restricted to small-scale enterprises
such as food processing and the manufacturing of garments and some
consumer goods.  Vietnamese private businessmen complain of an
unequal playing field on which they are forced to compete with
privileged state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

"The state sector has a monopoly of many high profit businesses
like telecoms, real estate, export and import but the private
sector is not allowed to take charge of them," says Bui Huy Hung,
president of Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank, one of a handful
of share holding banks.

"This is the biggest obstacle to the transition to the market
economy."

Despite a vigorous campaign by Hanoi that has cut the number of
SOEs to 6,000 from 12,5000 since 1990, Hanoi appears set on
maintaining the state sector's dominance of key sectors of the
economy.  Foreign economists point out that most of the SOEs closed
down as part of the down-sizing were small, town-based units in the
provinces, with little economic clout, even collectively.

In mid-1994, Hanoi formed 14 conglomerates in sectors such as
electricity, cement, textiles and rubber.  "The idea is to increase
competition and to form more commercial establishments," says Phan
Van Tiem, chairman of the government's State Enterprise Reform
Committee, admitting that Vietnamese policy makers are using the
chaebol of South Korea as one model.

Foreign economists and the World Bank suspect that the creation of
such conglomerates may be just another way of strengthening SOE
control over the economy, saying that rubber scarcely qualifies as
a strategic industry.

"They cannot do this with the state sector as the centre of
gravity," says one foreign economist.

Economists see an urgent need to mobilise domestic savings -
estimated at about $2bn - and channel them into the banking system.
 Progress on this has been slow due to traditional mistrust of
banks and despite the launch this year of a series of domestic
treasury bill auctions ultimately aimed at the retail market.

In the meantime, Vietnam hopes to meet some of its spending needs
by issuing government bonds internationally.  Hanoi is keen to move
as fast as possible with huge sums needed for infrastructure,
education and healthcare.

"Vietnam has ambitious targets and the danger is that they going to
spend too much too quickly, and that could affect inflation and the
balance of payments," said a foreign economist in Hanoi.

VIETNAM: $1bn for flat steel mill

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Vietnam's attempts to aggressively recruit foreign companies to build
steel mills within its borders are about to pay off in a big way.
Korea's Posco and Daewoo are finalising plans to build Vietnam first
flat-product steel mill, which could cost as much as $1 billion.

"We are discussing this project with Daewoo and VSG," Sujin Oh,
Posco's chief representative in Hanoi said.  "We have finished the
pre-feasibility study."

The large infrastructual needs expected to be associated with the
project are causing headaches in determining its location.  At
least three sites are under consideration, two in central Vietnam
and one in the north.  The Vietnamese are again pushing for Duang
Quat as a steel mill fits in well with their ideas of
industrialising central Vietnam.  Costs for infrastructure alone,
including a deep-see port that could accommodate ships of at least
40,000 dead-weight tonnes and adequate electricity and roads, are
likely to be about US$200 million.

"We assume the Vietnamese government will provide the
infrastructure," he said.  The Vietnamese are assuming that the
foreigners will pay for it.

Four joint ventures between Vietnam Steel Corporation and foreign
partners have come on line within the last 18 months with a total
capacity of more than 700,000 tonnes.  This is still short of
Daewoo's annual projections for Vietnam of 3 million tons by 2000.

All of these mills are producing construction steel, which is used
primarily for reinforcing buildings.

Vietnam at present has no mills producing flat steel, which is used
in products such as cars, refrigerators and washing machines.  The
Korean flat steel mill will be a welcome part of the national
strategy that Vietnam is encouraging in its shift to heavy
manufacturing.

VIETNAM: $650m for Vung Tau port

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

In the largest build-operate-transfer deal ever signed in Vietnam, a
Taiwanese led consortium  is to put up to $650m into turning Vung
Tau into the nation's leading container port.  The deal, involving
Taiwan's Evergreen, Malaysia's MMC Ports, and Singapore's Tredia
Resources, is the largest infrastructure investment on record.
Under the BOT contract the consortium will run the port for 40
years before handing it back to the government.

A first phase is expected to go into operation within two years and
with 15 years the project will have the capacity to handle 45
million tonnes of cargo annually.

Vietnam Marine Corporation, a state-owned entity, will initially
hold a 5 per cent stake in the project but as the expansion starts
to make money it will buy shares from its foreign partners to
increase this to up to 20 per cent.

The Vung Tau upgrade will complement the $40m revamp of Saigon
Port.  The ADB funded project will see capacity there expanded by
25% by 1998.

With annual trade growing at 30% Vietnam's ports are woefully inadequate
to handle it.  They could become completely congested within two
years as new infrastructure development fails to keep pace with
trade.

Vietnam has a BOT law to encourage infrastructure improvements but
few companies have attempted this form of investment because of
limited guarantees on foreign exchange and pricing of services.

Cambodia downsizes contract

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Phnom Penh:

Cambodia has a unique interpretation of downsizing, the American
term for reducing employees.  Cambodia downsizes entire contracts.
Two years ago it threw out two Thai airlines and signed with the
Malaysians for Royal Air Cambodge.  A year ago Phnom Penh signed a
billion dollar deal with Malaysian company YTL to turn Angkor Wat
into a major tourist attraction.  Now, the land that had been
awarded to YTL (1095 hectares) has been cut in half and seven new
companies have been called in to bid on its development.

Aspara, the agency charged with overseeing protection and
management of the temples, has asked two local companies and five
foreign firms including France's Dumen GTM Cambodge, and Korea's
Daewoo.  YTL was not even on the list.

The rebidding for the Angkor Wat complex reveals the infighting
between Tourism Minister Veng Sereyvuth who supported YTL, and
State Minister Van Moulyvann who leads Aspara.  The latter had been
particularly critical of YTL's proposals for a light-and-sound
show, while conservationists are worried that the hotels will be
built on archaeologically protected land.

For his part Veng Sereyvuth defended YTL saying that it had
produced a professional plan that would protect the environment and
had commissioned a study showing the light-and-sound show would not
damage the temples.

The real question that investors are asking on their Cambodian
deals is whether a Cambodian contracts is worth the paper it is
written on.  The YTL downsizing is an obvious example that its not.

BURMA: $7 billion despite pressure

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

The generals in Burma have reason to feel optimistic.  Despite
increasing pressure for foreigners to disinvest and continuing
American calls for sanctions, total approved investment in Burma
should reach $7 billion by year's end.  All is from the private
sector with oil and gas attracting the most investment with 25
projects worth $1.44 billion.

Since 1988 when SLORC took over the government no loans had been
forthcoming from international financial institutions such as the
World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Asian
Development Bank (ADB).

The lack of foreign aid and soft loans does restrict development,
says David Abel, the country's Minister for Economic Development.
But he still believes that private investment will continue to
blossom with another $1.5 billion committed by March 1997.

Whereas Abel believes that Burma, which is still a member of the
governing bodies of the WB, ADB and IMF, faces only political
obstacles rather than "technical" ones for the resumption of loans.
 An ADB official said the inadequacy of economic reforms in Burma
and the government's foreign exchange policy were the main
stumbling blocks.

American companies remain the leading investors in Burma with more
than $250m committed so far on 15 projects.  Some 20 countries have
so far invested $4.13 billion in 176 projects, with two European
nations among the top three investors.

Britain tops the list with $1.003 billion invested, followed by
Singapore ($896 million) and France ($465 million).

VIETNAM: British may get a chance

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

British construction firm John Liang International may yet get the
chance to build Hanoi's new international airport.  Four years ago
it had submitted a bid for a new, smaller passenger terminal after
undertaking a privately financed feasibility study that assessed
passenger growth and traffic forecasts.  The British firm, despite
strong backing from London, lost the Hanoi contract to a Japanese
construction group and work on the first phase of the Hanoi
rebuilding scheme, the construction of a new international
passenger terminal, has just begun.

The Vietnamese, never slow to use foreign cash to achieve their own
goals, have decided that the new Hanoi airport would serve both
civilian and military aircraft.  Japanese aid is given under strict
civilian guidelines and is specifically prohibited from being used
to assist military - related projects.  This means that the
Japanese will most likely withdraw from the project altogether.  If
that happens, the most likely beneficiary will be John Liang
International that still has the original ,50m in government aid
that was used to back its earlier bid.  Talks have been opened and
the Vietnamese are receptive to a British takeover should the
Japanese falter.

The Hanoi revamp, plus a similar one in Saigon, are the
cornerstones of a massive upgrading scheme.  The country's civil
aviation department has proposed spending $5 billion to $8 billion
during the next 15 years to improve 50 airports throughout the
country.

An IATA report has predicted that air traffic in Vietnam would grow from
1.2 million passengers in 1993 to 3.9 million in 2000 and 17.4
million by 2010.

VIETNAM: Individual tax in VN

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

David King is the resident representative in Vietnam of accountancy firm
Pannell Kerr Foster.  He clarifies here the tax regulations that
foreign individuals face when they take up residence in Vietnam.

A recent crackdown on foreign representative offices by the tax
department has caused some confusion among foreign workers about
what taxes they should be paying and who they should pay them to.

The Hanoi People's Committee has sent a memo to all foreign
representative offices in the city saying that its External
Economic Department is now charged with collecting the income tax
of Vietnamese and foreigners in representatives offices.  This
means that staff in these offices must pay their salary tax to the
People's Committee instead of the tax department.

The tax department is looking at ways to increase its effectiveness
in tax collections and, in a sense, the People's Committee has been
sub-contracted to collect the taxes for which it receives a small
commission.

The People's Committee is taking a common sense approach to
collecting the taxes and there now appears to be an unofficial
amnesty for foreign representative offices to lodge their income
declarations.  However, if a representative office in audited and
found to be neglecting its tax payments, the tax office is unlikely
to show any leniency.

From the People's Committee's perspective the chief representative
must be a resident in Vietnam, which raises two issues.

One is the tax perspective.  If you are nominated as chief
representative, the People's Committee tax collection team
considers that you are a resident and you should be paying tax on
your worldwide income at Vietnamese tax rates.

There are three tax levels for foreign workers.  According to the
Tax Act a foreigner working in Vietnam for less than 30 days over
any consecutive 12-month period pays no tax on his or her income.

The difference between Vietnam and other countries is that the
12-month period does not necessarily coincide with Vietnam's tax
year, which is from January to December.

The second tax scale applies to a foreigner working in Vietnam for
more than 30 days and less than 183 days over a consecutive
12-month period.

If you fit into this group you are supposed to pay tax at a flat
rate of 10 per cent on Vietnam-sourced income.

The third rate is for a fully-fledged resident in the country for
any period over 183 days.  This is the criteria under which the
chief representative falls and is taxed on his worldwide salary and
wages income.

The chief representative should be paying tax at this third rate
because he should be a permanent employee of an office in Vietnam.

There is no difference between paying tax to the People's Committee
and the tax department.  The tax payer fills in the same form and
receives the same receipt - the payment simply goes to a different
address.

The People's Committee issues an assessment which says how much
each employee must pay per month.  The amount is paid and a receipt
is issued.

Confusion in paying taxes for foreign workers arises because
payments must be made monthly and many foreigners are in Vietnam -
on and off - for short periods.  Many workers are uncertain how
long they will remain in the country, making it difficult to assess
which tax level they fall under and how much they should pay.

A preferable tax system would not categorise tax payers at the
beginning of their work period - they would be categorised over the
long term.  Monthly tax would be paid at a marginal rate then fully
reconciled in the annual return.

BURMA: Is SLORC on a slide ?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

In a country that is chronically short of telephones Burma's SLORC
is selling its citizens mobile phones - 4000 of them at $4000 each.
 But as the phones have to be purchased in dollars, the $16m

generated from the sale drained the local black market of dollars
and seriously undermined the value of the kyat.  The local currency
lost a quarter of its value in this odd attempt to boost government
coffers.  The attempted solution to one problem led to potentially
more serious problems elsewhere.

But mobile phones are only part of the story.  They are not the
sole reason for the fall in the kyat, and nor is the exchange rate
the only difficulty confronting  SLORC.

Newspaper headlines have been dominated by talk of rising political
tensions, increasing dissent among opposition groups and
international criticism of Rangoon's human rights record, and SLORC
faces a whole range of worsening economic problems.  Its attempts
to tackle these problems threaten to make matters worse before they
get better.  And the economic woes have great potential to add to
the discontent.

Inflation is rising, a trend that can only worsen as the currency
depreciates.  Dollars are becoming harder to find because they are
needed for imports, while dollar-earning exports face numerous
obstacles.  The trade balance is in deficit.

Investment, which ought to offer a major means of escape from this
vicious cycle, is also looking grim, with a growing number of
foreign firms deferring projects or withdrawing from the country
because of political controversy.

SLORC's hopes of raising foreign exchange through its Visit Burma
Year campaign have been largely dashed because of the dissidents'
campaign against the promotion, and because some tourists are
afraid of trouble.

"SLORC is tying itself up with economic problems," said one Asian
diplomat.

Most businessmen expect the kyat to hover around 180 kyat to the
dollar until the end of the year.  This compares to its movement
last year between 100 and 110 kyat on the unofficial market.  The
official exchange rate is 5.6 kyat to the dollar.

One of the reasons for the economic concerns is the deteriorating
political situation.  Confrontations between SLORC and opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the arrests in May of 262 of Mrs Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy members for "questioning" are
the most visible troubles.

This incident, together with the death of James Leander Nichol, the
former honorary counsel for Denmark, Finland, Norway and
Switzerland, has prompted some Scandinavian countries and the
United States to seriously consider economic sanctions against
Rangoon.

Also contributing to the worries are rumours of the deteriorating
health of the country's main strongman, Ne Win, according to
analysts in Rangoon.

Suu Kyi has been outspoken in calling for the suspension of
overseas aid and for a boycott of the government's Visit Myanmar
Year 1996 campaign.  This has been "psychologically effective"
among international communications and is frustrating SLORC, said
one Burmese businessmen.

"The investment climate is now looking grim," said another observer.

"People are made to feel insecure by such political confrontation,"
said a third.

Their dissatisfaction could increase as the cost of living
increases.  Inflation has almost doubled, form 24 percent last year
to 40 percent at present.

As the kyat sinks, the cost of imports rises.  About 80 percent of
Burma's consumer products and construction materials are imported,
while exports include beans, pulses, low quality rice and raw
materials.

To generate more revenue for the government, SLORC has quietly
informed businessmen it has changed the formula for calculating the
tax it charges on imports and exports.

It has created a new official exchange rate to be used exclusively
for calculating import and export duties.  The price of imports and
exports is now calculated at 10 kyat per dollar instead of the 5.6
kyat official rate it sets for actual transactions.

This could have meant a 20-fold leap in tax payments, but SLORC at
the same time slashed the duties payable on imports and exports
from 100 percent to 10 percent.  The result is that the duty rate
has doubled, with SLORC hoping its revenues will increase by
approximately 50 percent.

The new formula has increased the price of imported consumer
products by 20-30 percent, according to Sriwat Suwarn, the Thai
Minister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs in Rangoon.

"Poor people and low-ranking civil servants are suffering most," he
said.

The salaries of government officials range from 1,000 kyat per
month to 2,500 kyat for those at the director general level.

Many local businessmen disagree with the new plan but say there is
no one to turn to with their complaints.

Mr Sriwat predicted SLORC would be forced to scrap the new formula
because it is unworkable and will cause widespread discontent.

The military government is aware of the rising cost of products and
early this year opened a new Government Employees Bank to help
civil servants.  The bank grants interest-free loans equal to 10
times monthly salaries so officials can keep pace with the rising
cost of living.

SLORC knows the public servants will have difficulties repaying the
loans, whose first repayments are due next month, so a 60 percent
salary increase is expected to be announced in the new few weeks,
according to one Burmese source.

"The 60 percent increase is to help them repay the money they
borrow," he said.

Unfortunately, traders have already raised their prices as they
know civil servants have more money to spend as a result of the
loans.  Rumours of a new salary hike will only add to the
escalating prices, said the source.

Thein Tun, the chairman of Pepsi-Cola Products Myanmar Co, places
the economic blame elsewhere.  He said export problems are caused
by port congestion, but this should ease in two years time when new
facilities are in place.

"There are 47 ships waiting to berth but we cannot export our
commodities," he said.

To ease the port congestion, the government has recently signed an
agreement with three Singaporean companies - C & P Holding,
Sinmardev International and Myanmar Integrated Port Service - to
build wharves and other facilities at a new port in Thilawa, about
30 kilometres from the capital.

Construction is expected to be completed in two years.

But Mr Sriwat of the Thai Embassy said this would not be enough.
The government should seriously consider measures to attract
foreign investment in manufacturing industries as the value-added
production would help reduce imports and boost exports.

Added investment would break the vicious cycle of devaluation and
inflation, but foreign confidence in Burma is at a new low.

The recent withdrawal of European brewers Heineken and Carlsberg,
and cancellations by a group of Japanese tourists planning to visit
Burma are just some examples of the multinational pressure mounting
on the junta.

Threats from the US to sanction Burma would not have a major impact
on the country because it is not a major trade partner of SLORC,
said one Burmese trader.

But it would cost the jobs of 40,000 Burmese who work in textile
factories serving the American market, he added.

VIETNAM: Hanoi admits foreigners are sceptical

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

In a somewhat refreshing comment, a high level official in Vietnam's
Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), vice-minister Nguyen
Nhac, has admitted that despite a decade of opening up, foreign
investors are still sceptical of the government's policies.

This month should see the amendment for the third time of Vietnam's
Foreign Investment Law.  It is supposed to focus on simplification
of post-licence procedures, such as land use permits, construction
permits and taxation, and other challenges which foreign investors
are encountering that, presumably, covers things such as the state
theft of 40 containers of mining equipment from Westralian Sands
earlier this year.

Under the revamped investment law investors will get permits for
land use and construction in one month.  The government has
facilitated licence procedures since the merger of a licensing body
(State Committee for Cooperation and Investment) and a planning
agency (State Planning Committee) last year creating a theoretical
one-stop service at the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).

But investors are still struggling in some areas of investment and
in some parts of the country, Nhac said.  "In some areas MPI works,
but in others there are still problems.  That's why we're
determined to perfect our legal framework and improve the
environment including infrastructure.  In certain areas, investment
is falling, such as in real estate and office/hotel projects.  But
we see a good trend: over 80% of the projects are manufacturing
industries, which is in line with our needs."

MPI is considering more incentives or facilities for industrial
estate development.  "We try to provide facilities, the lowest land
rents of fees, fewer taxes and longer tax exemptions," he said.

What Nhac would do well to consider is a concerted effort to
prevent foreign investors from being ripped off at the slightest
excuse.  Over-charging and corruption is one thing.  That can be
managed.  But orchestrated state theft is quite another.  There is
far too much of both at a time when Vietnam is facing serious regional
competition for the investment dollar.

VIETNAM: Following in thou footsteps

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

As Westralian Sands executives fled their Ha Tinh ilmenite mine
with little more than the shirts on their backs, and leaving behind
40 containers of sophisticated mining equipment that was
subsequently stolen by provincial authorities, another Australian
company was digging in for the long term.

Perth based Golden Tiger Resources is one of the few publicly
listed firms in Australia to focus entirely on Vietnam.  "Our company is
now completely set up to become a mining company in Vietnam,"
Golden Tiger Resources managing director Rupert Crowe said.  "It is
going to take a while, but we have confidence that there is a lot
to be found there."

Two of Golden Tiger's Vietnam's projects are 50-50 joint ventures with
the Canadian mining company Teck Corp.  Golden Tiger has three
exploration programmes under way in Vietnam.  Two are joint ventures
with Teck to search for gold, and the other is a lead-zinc project.

With reference to Hanoi's theft of 40 containers of mining
equipment, Crowe said, "Obviously, there are concerns about those
sort of problems.  But our relationship with the Vietnamese is very
good." Westralian said much the same thing, right up until the
police put a padlock on their mine.

VIETNAM: Sponsorship opportunities abound

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

In Indochina, there are great opportunities for sponsorship, but a
lot of thought must be given to the realities of each country
before events are planned, according to Bates Vietnam chairman
David Bell.

Mr Bell said it is believed that consumer involvement in events is
stronger in the developing markets of Indochina because consumers
have been isolated from international-style events for a long time.

"In the case of Vietnam, it's about 20 years.  therefore, virtually
anything new is exciting," said Mr Bell.

However, because of the rigid system of government control in some
countries, it does not mean that all sponsorships will
automatically be a success.

In Vietnam, there is a three-station TV Choice in Saigon and Hanoi,
and the station calculates its rate on time segments rather than
programming.

"TV cost efficiency is generally good.  However, one of the major
problems is the inability of the TV Stations to plan their
programming in advance and their likelihood to change," said Mr
Bell.

"Viewers may get used to a foreign entertainment programme being on
at a certain time each week, but suddenly it will change and much
viewership is lost."

In Burma, only the state-run TV Station gives national coverage and
reaches a total audience of around three to four million viewers.
A peak time 30-second spot goes for $585, so for high rating
programmes, Myanmar TV is very economical.

According to Mr Bell, sponsorship is not well developed in
Cambodia, but it is possible to do it.  He explained that the Thai
station, TV5, is easier to deal with and has better coverage - with
spillover into Cambodia.  The Thais are also more clued up about
sponsorship.  However, it is more expensive for a peak time spot,
and no reliable research is used to evaluate performance.

All these three countries have marked differences in cultural
values.  They have different religions and languages, though there
are some common languages such as English, Chinese, French and Thai.

"The trend for marketing events in these countries is to use local
languages," said Mr Bell.

"Nevertheless, some important similarities, like sport, music,
entertainment programmes and popular sciences, are such that
sponsorship and event marketing can use them for regional
activities that can reach similar groups across differing cultures.

"Though there are a lot of problems we have to face in organising
sponsorships and event marketing in these markets, we should try
new things and have patience with the authorities and other
logistical problems."

LAOS: Lao runaround on telecom deal

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane:

Doing business in Indochina is never easy but the runaround given
to Thailand's Shinawatra telecoms group was more frustrating than
most.  Three times it flew its executives and media reps into
Vientiane in anticipation of the contract signing.  The first
postponement was due to only a Lao version of the contract being
available.  The Lao's inexplicably gave as their reason for the
delay a requirement for an English version of the contract.

The second postponement was due to the arrival in Vientiane of
Thailand's Prime Minister which gave Lao government officials a
much better excuse to be unavailable.  The third postponement
underlined the reasons for the first delay.  Vientiane had been
offered a better deal by M Group, another Thai telecom giant which
has a high profile in Laotian telecommunications.

M Group has won a licence from the Lao government to operate a
gigantic broad-casting satellite project, L-Star.  The country's
first satellite will be put into orbit in December next year and
will cover all of Asia.

Shinawatra operates Thaicom satellites of similar coverage and
capacity.  The top bosses at both groups are widely known to have
had a difficult relationship for the past few years.  Suradet
Mukyangkoon, a highly-placed source in the Lao government said the
postponements were caused merely by a Thai company wishing to
participate in the telecom projects.

"The company has approached the government and made attractive
offers many times while Shinawatra was engaged in negotiating to
work out the new deal," said the government source, without naming
the contender.

The message to investors is clear.  If negotiating in Indochina in
good faith, you can bet on it that the other side isn't.  If the
other side comes up with a litany of excuses to avoid signing a
contract, look over your shoulder.  You will probably find the
competition using every trick in the book to get you out of the
picture.

LAOS: Urban growth, rural poverty

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane, AP:

Ten years after embracing capitalist-style reforms and cautiously
opening its doors, this impoverished communist nation in the heart
of a dynamic Southeast Asia is beginning to register economic
growth.

But while more urban dwellers can buy cars and television sets,
relatively little has been done to fight malnutrition, disease and
illiteracy in the valleys and hills where most Laotians live.

"The growth is not distributed equally.  The challenge this country
is facing is a widening gap between city and country, the rich and
the poor," says Jan Mattsson, head of UN Development Programme in
Laos.

While sleepy by the standards of most Asian capitals, Vientiane is
revving up.  Its markets are full, new restaurants and hotels are
opening, and banks from neighbouring, wildly capitalistic Thailand
dominate the city's main Avenue of a Million Elephants.

But by World Bank estimates, half of Lao's 4.6 million people still
fall below a poverty line set at $12 of income or goods a month.
In rural areas, most are subsistence farmers who cannot participate
in a market economy and whose lives are mirrored in the bleak
overall statistics.

Average life expectancy is 51 years.  More than one-third of adults
are illiterate.  Electricity reaches only 15 percent of the
population.  Nearly half the children under 5 years suffer stunted
growth from chronic malnutrition.

Officials argue that a rich-poor gap is inevitable when centralised
control is loosened in favour of the free market.  But to this, say
analysts, is added a deeply rooted disregard for the countryside by
Vientiane's elite - colonial, royalist or today's mix of Marxist
power brokers,  old families and the newly rich.

"When you open up the country, the black beast emerges,: said
Thongphachanh Sonnasinh, a senior planning official.  "But we are
trying to decentralise the resources we get from outside."

At its sixth congress in last March, the 78,000-member Communist
Party focused on the issues of equality and how quickly it should
embrace the outside world.

Underlying the debate are apparent fears that the economic gap
could bring political instability and that wide open doors could
lead to loss of both party control and national sovereignty.

Laos is certainly vulnerable.  It is land-locked, heavily dependent
on some $200 million in foreign aid each year and surrounded by
economically aggressive Thailand, Vietnam and China.  It has little
to offer foreign investors but its natural resources - chiefly,
minerals, hydroelectric potential and rapidly diminishing forests.

The world's least populated communist state admits controlling the
more than 500 foreign investors already here is difficult.  Laos
will even be hard pressed to find qualified officials to staff the
200-plus annual meetings held by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, which it joins next year.

"While not completely reversing course, the party appears to have
chosen to emphasize the perceived dangers stemming from the
open-door policy, including social problems and a loss of economic
control," says Ray Eaton, an Australian businessman with extensive
contacts in Indochina.

The liberalising "New Economic Mechanism", introduced in 1986, has
yielded some benefits, and Laos is one of the few least developed
countries to enjoy growth.

Despite an inflation rate of nearly 20 percent and flooding that
displaced 10 percent of the population, Laos still managed a 7.1
percent economic growth rate last year.

Since 1988, foreigners have invested $5 billion, three-quarters of
this going into hydroelectric power projects that economists say
could help pull Laos out of poverty over the decade.

"We want to grow faster and join the developed community, but our
conditions are not yet ready," said Mr Thongphachanh in an
interview.  "We now take one step forward, one step back.  We are
on the platform, but don't know when the launch will take place."

Despite such caution and anxiety - voiced by almost every official
in Laos - odds are great the country will inevitably be drawn into
the one of the world's fastest growing regions.

All-weather roads linking Laos to China and Vietnam are being
rapidly constructed, while agreement was recently reached to build
a second bridge across the Mekong River to Thailand.  Some 43,000
tourists visited the country last year, up from almost zero a few
years earlier.

Membership in the seven-nation ASEAN will force Laos to lower
trade, immigration and other barriers.  The country may even enter
cyberspace: One foreign company is trying to introduce the hitherto
illegal Internet.

VEITNAM: Environment loses in race for economic growth

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bien Hoa:

More than two decades after the Americans decimated Vietnam's tropical
forests and farmland with defoliants and bombing, the country's
ecosystem is under attack again, this time from unharnessed
economic growth.

Flushed with the success of its drive to revamp an economy scarred
by years of war and isolation, Vietnam's communist leadership is now
planning a hell-for-leather dash to become an industrialised nation.

"If the government doesn't smarten up its act on the environment,
it will have a Bangkok or Jakarta on its hands by the end of the
century," said one Western aid worker.  "Alarm bells are ringing
and the government is listening with only half an ear."

Vietnam says pollution has not yet become a serious problem.  But a
casual observer in the southern boom town of old Saigon, might
disagree.

Long lines of trucks belching filthy emissions clog the main
arteries into the city, where the tinkle of bicycle bells has long
been drowned out by the roar of cars and motorbikes.

Cars are still somewhat of a novelty in what remains one of the
world's poorest nations, but annual sales are expected to grow
almost six-fold between now and the end of the century to 60,000
units.  That will put a major strain on the country's road system,
one of the most primitive in Asia.

Down at the Saigon River, which runs through the heart of the city,
scavengers rummage through stinking mounds of garbage.  Others poke
about in the inky water, where huge islands of debris float along
with dead rats and human faeces.

About 30 kilometres to the northeast, the ageing Bien Hoa 1
industrial park spews mountains of untreated waste into the Dong
Nai River, a tributary of the river that flows through Saigon and
provides 90 percent of its drinking water.

The Dong Nai Paper Company deposits some 3,000 tonnes of untreated
caustic soda into the Dong Nia River every year.  Hoan, general
director of the company, says fishermen have long deserted the
stretch of river by his plant.

"This is an old factory so we don't have a chemical recovery
system," he said.  "The chemicals just go into the river."

However, the government is starting to listen to the warnings of
environmentalists, even if it is less than keen to make the
financial investment needed for prevention.  A law on environmental
protection was introduced in 1994, and companies like the Dong Nai
Paper Company are being told to clean up or close down.

The state-run media has also been peppered in recent months with
articles critical of careless exploitation of resources,
particularly deforestation and indiscriminate use of fertilisers
for cash crops such as coffee and rubber.

The World Wide Fund for Nature says Vietnam's forest cover is just 19
percent today, against 43 percent in 1943.   Remote-sensing data
shows that at current reduction rates, the natural primary forests
will disappear within 20 years.

"At this juncture of Vietnam's development it is important not to repeat
the mistakes of many other countries, particularly some of the
neighbouring countries," Nay Tuen, the UNDP's Asia-Pacific
Director, said at one conference on the environment.

Nevertheless, critics say the authorities still show a worrying
tendency to brush pollution problems under the carpet.  A recent
oil spill in the Mekong Delta, for example, was reported days later
in the local press and officials refused to go further than confirm
it had happened.

VIETNAM: What's in a road ?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Laos and Vietnam are like two lovers sleeping together, but if they are
to grow together the roads linking them must be expanded and
upgraded.  The Lao's want the access to Vietnam's deep water ports that
will wean them away from expensive road transport and Bangkok.  The
Vietnamese are looking for tourist and trade links across Laos to
Thailand.  A number of options have been put forward, some by Laos,
others by Vietnam.  There is no doubt as to the benefits should road
links between Laos and Vietnam improve.

Route 8 which links Paksane with Vinh in Vietnam is the road most
favoured by the Lao's.  It is the shortest route from Thailand to
Vietnam, as well as from Vientiane to Vietnam.  The 260 kms of the road
that
is in Vietnam is in reasonable condition while much of the Laotian part
is barely usable over mountainous, winding terrain.  The road also
complements the continuing construction of Nam Theun 2 and Nam
Theun Hinboon hydro power plants.  Route 9 connects Mukdahan with
Savannakhet in Laos and Vietnam's central port town of Da Nang, some 500
kms away.  Again, in Vietnam it is in fairly good shape while in Laos it
is in bad need of repair.  There are plans, perhaps dreams would be
a better description, to revamp an old railway that runs parallel
to Route 9.

Both routes are seen as new avenues for the free flow of goods
between industrial northeastern Thailand and Vietnam.  Developing them
is a priority project for the Asian Development Bank, which is the
main advocate of a sub-regional cooperation scheme for six
countries sharing the Mekong River: China, Vietnam, Laos, Burma,
Thailand and Cambodia.

Since Vietnam is pressing ahead towards industrialisation or
semi-industrialisation by the year 2000 its leaders are aiming for
social, political as well as economic results by promoting direct
foreign investment in what is the poorest part of the country.
Laos, for its part, is serious about economic development and
raising the people's standard of living.  By 2000 it wants to see
its per capita income up to $500 a year and to introduce
electricity to at least half of Savannakhet province.  It is hoping
that renovating Routes 8 and 9 will give the province the magical
impetus.

The economic boast will, of course, come from he hundreds of
millions of dollars needed for the upgrade.  Its not just the roads
that require money.  Besides upgrading and reconstructing roads,
software issues like customs and immigration procedures also have
to be worked out.  The ADB is reported to be committed to financial
assistance, but disbursement will take time.  But once it does
start to roll out its millions there will be plenty all round for
foreign expertise and investment in the tourist infrastructure
associated with the two projects.

VIETNAM: Hold that lease

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

Imagine that you're found your ideal office on home in Vietnam and the
lease is awaiting signature.  Before signing it would be wise to
consider the hidden extras.  An apparent `good deal' could be a
disaster in the making.

Depending on whether one is in the north or the south, measurement
can very greatly.  In the north, most buildings are let on a nett
internal area basis.  In the south, most projects are offered on a
gross area basis which means that tenants are charged for all the
common areas.  These could occupy as much as 20% of the floor area.

Rents are usually quoted nett of taxes and service charges, the
latter ranging from $3 to $8 psm.  When paying rent, expect also to
pay the 20% tax that is levied on the landlord's income.  That
brings the psm cost to 110% of rental.  Car parks are seldom
included in a rental.  They could cost an extra $100 psm per month.
 Even parking a bicycle may not be free.  Where daytime
air-conditioning costs may be included in the service costs, night
time or holiday air-conditioning will be extra.  The ideal building
should have a separate electricity meter for every tenant.

Once the extras have been understood and factored into the rental,
the lease can be signed.  Then one is faced with fit-out costs of
$250 psm for average quality to up to $1,000 psm for a quality that
approximates the best that Hongkong would have to offer.

It is vital that a tenant has clear understanding of what be is
getting.  In Vietnam, the `fair' part of a deal is usually found on the
side of the Vietnamese.

CAMBODIA: Caltex aims for 10%

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Phnom Penh:

It's been 21 years since Caltex was last in Cambodia.  The US oil
giant has re-entered the Cambodian market on a wave of confidence
starting with the first American owned retail outlet since 1975.

Caltex has plans to invest $20m in Cambodia, opening some 20
service stations in Phnom Penh and major provincial cities and
building a major oil depot at Sihanoukville.

"We see great potential here," said Clifton Hon, chairman of the
Caltex Group of Companies based in Singapore.

He said studies indicated that Cambodia's current
11,000-barrel-per-day consumption of petroleum products could more
than quadruple in the coming decade if its economy develops along
the lines of its neighbours.

"We're hoping for at least a 10% market share very quickly," said
John Raeside, the general manager of Caltex Cambodia Ltd.

Five other Caltex stations are now under construction in the
capital and the company is looking at sites to build on in
Cambodia's second-largest city of Battambang and in the populous
east-central province of Kampong Cham.

The service stations will eventually be supplied by the $8m
Sihanoukville depot which will handle oil from Caltex refineries in
Singapore and Thailand.

The depot is expected to be completed in mid-1997 and until then
products will be shipped up the Mekong River to the port in Phnom
Penh.

VIETNAM: Viet Kieu fail to invest

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

Supporting one's relations is one thing, supporting the government
is another.  That seems to be the rationale behind the reluctance
of Viet Kieu to invest in their old homeland.  Only a trickle of
investment has found its way back from overseas Vietnamese, who
remain mostly unconvinced by the tax breaks and preferential
treatment on offer.  Viet Kieu investment is around half a per cent
of foreign invested capital.  Since Vietnam launched its reforms in 1988
only $130m has come from Viet Kieu.  Of that, only $7m can be
attributed to the 1.5 million Vietnamese who settled in America.

Hanoi has offered a 20% reduction in taxes and a flat five-percent
tax on profit remittances.  Viet Kieu are given the same rights as
domestic firms to lease property and hire staff unlike other
foreign investors.

But as one Viet Kieu told BNI, " we may look stupid, but we are not
stupid."  Viet Kieu continue to help their relations to the tune of
$600m a year in remittances to fund hotels, restaurants and shops
that remain outside official channels.  Those few who do return
chaff under the country's dual pricing system that makes foreigners
pay more than double what locals pay for hotels and airfares.

While welcoming their money, officials remain suspicious of people
who fled and many Viet Kieu complain of harassment by security
services.  Despite the repeated pledges by the government that it
wants to close the chapter on the past, anxieties about the
political and social impact of Viet Kieu remain near the surface.

Communist Party chief Do Muoi warned in a recent speech that Saigon
was a hotbed of sabotage plots concocted by "hostile forces," a
reference to overseas Vietnamese groups opposed to the government.

CAMBODIA: Cambodia has its own 'bullet' train

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

'Bullet' trains in Cambodia take on a whole new meaning.  Not only
do the Khmer Rouge shoot them up, but when the soldiers who are
supposedly guarding the railway lines get bored they let fly with a
few bullets, too.  Being a passenger on a Cambodian train is often
a death sentence.  The northwest line from Phnom Penh to Battanbang
is subject to attack by the Khmer Rouge which continues to wage an
effective guerilla war along the Thai border.

In addition to rebel and bandit attacks the Royal Railways of
Cambodia (RRC) face horrendous maintenance problems.  The railway
is 70 years old.  For the past 25 years zero maintenance was
undertaken.  Locomotives are a mixture of Russian, American and
Chinese machines and often one finds an old wood or coal burner
chugging through the rice paddies.  Passenger transport is
nonexistent with freight trains being used to haul largely
nonpaying riders.

RRC embarked on a major modernization drive earlier this year
following the launch of a new nonstop freight train service between
Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville.  Travelling time has been halved to 6
hours.  That is still double the road time.  RRC has made track
upgrade on this sector its top priority so that speeds of up to 70
Kph could be achieved - double the current maximum.

The Asian Development Bank has been strongly supportive of RRC's
efforts to modernize, contributing $5m to rehabilitate 16 bridges,
repair culverts and embankments and replace wooden sleepers with
concrete ones.  While much work on the southern line remains to be
done, the train now runs on a regular daily basis.  The track
through Kampot, halfway between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, is
still in bad shape despite emergency rehabilitation.  The new
freight service from the coast is being mainly used to move
containers.  Sihanoukville is virtually an all-container port these
days and the train provides a cheap and relatively secure means of
getting cargo to the capital and empty containers back to the port.

RRC's director, Pich Kimsreang, would like to see Cambodia
connected to Thailand in the west and Saigon in the east.  He
commented, "The railway is very important for the tourism industry.
 We want to upgrade the existing lines and look into expansion of
the domestic network and at the same time link Cambodia to the
international railway network."

That, of course, depends on the defeat of the Khmer Rouge.  Only
then can RRC bury its reputation for 'bullet' train service.

VIETNAM: Viet cinemas get a boost

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Three years ago Vietnam had about 300 cinemas.  Today, only a handful
are left as owners rushed to convert them into more profitable
bars, restaurants and KTV dens.  Hanoi has only two cinemas for its
3 million people.  Those cinemas that remain open for business
usually only show Vietnamese films.  These have lost out in
popularity in recent years to imported movies from Hong Kong
watched at home or shown in street-side video bars.  Several US
films, including the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie True Lies,
have been screened at cinemas over the past year.

A cinema renaissance is about to begin with the arrival of an
American and a Thai company that hope to renovate several crumbling
Vietnamese cinemas and build new multiplex centres that will show
the latest US movies.

Vision Net International (VietnamI) has signed with state movie
distribution company Faflim to renovate cinemas in Hanoi, Saigon
and Da Nang, VietnamI would build 20 multiplex cinemas with up to four
screens, each with audience capacity of 300.  Fafilm, a state firm
known for its conservatism, will maintain control over the films
that are chosen for release.

VietnamI joins Kantana Group, a major Thai entertainment company that
intends to invest $40m in Indochina using satellite theatres, or
miniplexers as the Americans prefer to say.

In Laos, Kantana is operating three conventional cinemas.  It hopes
to establish 10 and 30 of its conventional cinemas in Cambodia and
Vietnam respectively.  This at a time when cinema attendance in Vietnam
has
dropped to almost zero and that country's number of operating
conventional cinemas has dropped to only 3.

Kantana believes that if conventional cinemas are received
positively without too many operational problems, Indochina could
well see the launch of 300 plus satellite theatres.  Kantana would
open them at the rate of 5 a year in the first phase and the
remainder in place and operating by 2005.

The main thrust of Kantana's cinema strategy in Indochina is to
introduce satellite theatre complexes.  But this first requires
operators who are familiar with the conventional theatre business.
Hence the initial emphasis on conventional cinemas.

The problem that Kantana and VietnamI will face is not so much in the
attractiveness of its cineplexes which is a given, but on whether
Indochinese can afford them.  Vietnam, the richest and most developed of
the Indochinese countries, has an average GDP of only $250, rising
to $850 in Saigon.  That doesn't leave much for more than one or
two visits a year to the movies.

BANGKOK: Giant remains cautious on VN

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bangkok:

Thailand's biggest cement maker, Siam Cement (SCC), is in no hurry
to establish a cement plant in Vietnam.  It cited inaccurate demand and
supply forecasts for its hesitancy.  This is in spite of it being
in Vietnam for the last four years sheparding investments as diverse as
roof tile manufacture and property development.  It has a $10m roof
tile venture in Song Be, near Saigon, where it also hopes to
produce sanitaryware.  But its real reason for being in Vietnam remains
the sale of its cement.

SCC was lured to Vietnam by Hanoi's forecast of annual cement demand of
20 million tons within the next four years versus annual production
of only 7.2 million tons.  Vietnam's construction boom has attracted
foreign investors to plunge into capital intensive cement
production, with five joint ventures licensed to date and another
awaiting approval.  That one involves Taiwan's Universal Cement and
two Vietnamese groups: Ha Tu Limestone Cement Enterprise in Quang
Ninh province and Vietnam Coal Corp (Vinacoal).  It would invest
$240m to produce 1.28 million tons a year of clinker and 1.5
million tons of cement.

By the end of this year Vietnam will have 25 cement factories.  Although
attractive to investors, the large scale of such projects and the
complexity of doing business in Vietnam have driven many to look for
government or multilateral guarantees for financing.  Especially
when they are all up and running there is a strong possibility of a
glut in the market.  Domestic cement production is expected to hit
nearly 20 million tons by 1999.  A surplus that would have to be
relieved through export or the lowering of operating levels.
Annual per capita consumption of cement in Vietnam is less than 100
killogrammes compared with Thailand's 420 and South Korea's 1,300.

At present SCC exports 80-100 container loads of its Elephant brand
cement to Vietnam each month.  It is looking at supplying related
produts such as premix concrete, paper pulp and paper-packaging.
It is also looking at other ASEAN markets to determine the best
logistical location for cement production.

LAOS: China cargoes transit Mekong

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane:

With China's southern province of Yunnan, Thailand, Burma and Laos
already part of a cooperative economic quadrangle, the next logical
step is to use the common waters of the Mekong River to transit
cargoes from China through to Thailand.  A private Thai company,
Lan Chang International (LCI) intends to do just that.  It hopes to
obtain permission from Laos to carry Chinese goods down the Mekong
to Thailand's port of Laem Chabang.

LCI already transports goods and tourists through the Yunnan Water
Transportation Company.  Its Chinese partner has 49% of the
company, LCI 41% and the balance split between Burma and Laos.  The
most popular route for tourists is from Chiang Saen in Chiang Rai
Province to Xisuangpanna in Yunnan.

A successful test transportation run for cargo along the Mekong
River was first carried out last year, with a vessel carrying
apples from China to Thailand through the Chiang Saen port in
Thailand's Chiang Rai province.

BANGKOK: Neighbours chase investment

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bangkok:

BOTH LAOS and Cambodia are keen to get their hands on the regional
investment dollar.  A recent seminar in Bangkok saw speaker after
speaker from Cambodia and Laos plead for more foreign funding of
their market economies.  If an investment could generate hard
currency, all the better.

For Laos, emphasis is being placed on investments in
hydroelectricity, mineral extraction and processing, agribusiness,
wood products, export-oriented light manufacturing, small-scale
tourism, and financial and transport services.

At present there are 230 projects in Laos that have been funded by
foreign investors, but only 168 are still operating.  It is still a
more encouraging figure than that found in Vietnam where only one third
of licensed projects are actually established.

Cambodia wants foreigners to invest in its still shaky tourist
industry which, for many investors, remains the easiest way to get
their hands on foreign currency.  Where Laos wants to shepard
investors into the state sector, Cambodia has no preference and
appears equally happy when an investor works through his private
contacts as with the country's national tourism board.
