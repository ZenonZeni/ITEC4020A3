This course was the first undergraduate course in Biotechnology
in the UK and has been offered by this Department since 1978.
It is a multi-disciplinary course teaching the theoretical and
practical skills needed to make a contribution to the application
of Biotechnology.  The course syllabus is under constant revue
to keep pace with developments in industry.
<P>
This course is of four years duration with a structure as shown
in the following table.  Students spend a minimum of three periods
training in industry as part of the course.

<b>Industrial placements</b> may be anywhere in the UK and also in many other European countries.  The University is part of  two EU schemes, Leonardo and Socrates, which support the exchange of staff and students between participating institutions.  There are occasional opportunities for training outside Europe. The Department arranges the placements taking into account the students' preferences. Normally students are paid a salary by the company with whom they are training. Most companies appoint a member of their staff to supervise the student during the placement.  Normally a member of the academic staff of the University Department will visit each student during each placement. Reports on the training are made by the student, the company and the visiting academic and on the basis of these reports the student's performance is assessed and this assessment is taken into account at the end of the course when decisions regarding the class of degree to be awarded are being made.
<p>
Further information about industrial training is available from our <a href="/workexp/workexp.htm">Industrial Training Office</a>.
<P>
<b>The time spent in the University</b> is organised into three parts and the subjects are grouped into modules.  An outline of the course and the topics studied is as follows:
<P>
<U><B>Part 1 (two terms) modules include:</B></U>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry Computing and Mathematics
<li>Cell Biochemistry
<li>Physical Aspects of Biological Systems
<li>Molecular Biology
<li>Introductory Food Technology and Biotechnology
<li>Microbiology     
</ul>                                    
These modules in Part 1 are taken in common with students following the courses in Food Science and Food Technology.
<P>
<U><B>Part 2 (three terms) modules include:</B></U>
<ul>
<li>Process Engineering                                 
<li>Biological Chemistry
<li>Process Control                                        
<li>Physical Chemistry
<li>Bioreactor Design
<li>Molecular Biology
<li>Enzyme Technology
<li>Microbiology
</ul>
Plus additional optional subjects such as: Industrial Management and a language.
<P>
<U><B>Part 3 (four terms) modules include:</B></U>
<ul>
<li>Biotechnological Processes                     
<li>Biochemical Engineering
<li>Process Design for Biotechnology         
<li>Applied Genetics and Cell Culture         
<li>Project
</ul>
Plus additional optional subjects such as Food Biotechnology, Environmental Biotechnology and further Industrial Management. The options available may change from year to year.
<P>
<B>Project</B><br>
Each student undertakes a project in Part 3.  This involves carrying out experimental work, either in the Departmental laboratories, another research institute or in industry, under the supervision of a member of academic staff, and an outside expert if appropriate.  The student then writes a report on this work.  Both the student's performance and the report are assessed.
<P>
<b>Teaching</b> <br>
Students attend lectures and participate in tutorials and seminars.  These activities are supported by practical work in the science and processing laboratories.
<P>
<b>Assessment</b><br>
There is a formal written examination at the end of Part 1.  Students must pass this in order to progress through the rest of the course.  In the event of failure
in the first attempt each subject may be retaken once.  There is no formal written examination at the end of Part 2.  Modules are assessed throughout Part 2. Students who do not perform satisfactorily in these modular assessments may be required to take a written examination.  Modules are also assessed throughout Part 3 of the course.  There is a formal written examination at the end of the course.  The class of degree awarded to each student will be based on consideration of the student's modular assessment throughout Parts 2 and 3, the results
of the final examination, and the assessment of the student's performance in the project and in industrial training.
<P>
<b>Prizes</b> <br>
There are a number of prizes awarded to students who perform very well in different aspects of the course and at different stages of it.
<P>
<b>Entry requirements</b><br>
Two, preferably three, A-level passes (or AS equivalents) in science subjects or mathematics.  GCSE/O-level mathematics is also required.  The
minimum grades required are CDD.  Good attainments in other courses such as the International Baccalaureate, BTEC, GNVQ or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be considered.
<P>
<b>Career opportunities</b><br>
Biotechnology is one of the world's fastest growing industrial sectors.  Biotechnologists find employment not just in the new biotechnology industries but
also in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, food and waste treatment industries.  The multi-disciplinary nature of the subject means that biotechnologists occupy a range of roles within industry, from research and development to production and management.  It also provides an excellent opportunity to undertake research for a higher degree in a wide range of subjects.  The emphasis on practical ability and problem solving also means that
our graduates can find employment in a range of unrelated industries.
<p>
<b>Other courses</b><br>
The Department offers undergraduate courses in Chemistry and Food Science (3 yrs), Food
Manufacture, Management and Marketing (4 yrs), Food Science (3 yrs), Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing (3 yrs) and Food Technology (4 yrs).  It also offers taught MSc courses in Food and Agricultural Biotechnology, Food Science and Food Technology as well as research courses leading to MPhil and PhD degrees.
