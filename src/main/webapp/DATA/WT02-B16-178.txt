<h2>MEMO OF RECORD
<br>INTERAGENCY ENERGY TASK FORCE MEETING</h2>
<B>Department of Energy</B><br>
<B>Forrestal Building, Room 8E-089</B><br>

<p>

Mark Ginsberg, Chairman of the Federal Interagency Energy Management Task Force
and Director of the Federal Energy Management Program opened the meeting and
initiated a round of introductions.<p>

Water Conservation Working Group (WCWG)<p>

Katherine Mayo (NREL) announced a WCWG meeting June 12, 1996, 10 a.m., to
discuss a draft Federal Register Notice to incorporate water conservation into
energy savings performance contracts.  Ashley Houston (NREL - Golden Office,
303-384-7412) has been named chair of the WCWG.<p>

Carlos Campos (NASA) reported that work is progressing on developing baselining
methods for measuring water consumption.  A two-tiered methodology is proposed:
1) a fast-track approach comprised of four equations, and 2) a long-term
research model.<p>

Mr. Ginsberg noted that the Monterey (CA) Water Conservation District is
experiencing a severe shortage and has an immediate need to implement water
conservation measures at agency facilities in that region.  He asked the Task
Force members to notify FEMP of any of their facilities in the Monterey area.<p>

New Technology Demonstration Program (NTDP)<p>
 
Dean McCauley (FEMP) introduced himself as the new program manager for the NTDP
program, succeeding Dean DeVine who retired.  Mr. McCauley noted the program
mission which is to reduce the time required for new technology to get into
Federal purchasing and use.  The program looks at products with large potential
energy savings.<p>

The program is based on partnerships in the form of Cooperative Research and
Development Agreements.  Another program component is the Federal Technology
Alert (FTA) publications which are essentially "consumer reports" of new
technologies.  Six FTAs have been published and are available on FEMP's internet
web site.  In addition, two summary test bed reports have been released. The
reports focus on Seahorse water heater converter (electric-to-natural gas), and
York Triathalon natural gas cooling units.  More information on these documents
is available from Karen Walker (PNNL) at 202-646-7794.<p>

Mr. Ginsberg asked that members call Mr. McCauley with feedback about NTDP.<p>

Agency Reporting of Vehicle Fuel Consumption<p>

Bill Rivers (GSA) gave an overview of reporting of gasoline and diesel fuel
consumption in Federal vehicles.  He noted that there are two reporting channels
- agency reporting to FEMP (Vehicles and Equipment) and the GSA's Federal Motor
Vehicle Fleet Reports (Vehicles Only).<p>  

With the expiration of  the Federal Property Management Regulations stemming
from the Executive Order 12795 10 percent reduction goal for gasoline and
diesel, a decision is needed on continued reporting of the fuels.  The Task
Force agreed that continued reporting has value, particularly if a new
requirement is instituted in the future.  Rich Wickman (NASA) noted that there
is some confusion regarding reporting for GSA vehicles that are assigned to an
agency.<p>

Mr. Klimkos said that FEMP has no problem with agency vehicle consumption
reports coming from GSA. Larry Frisbee (GSA) noted that agencies should be
involved in the reporting of assigned vehicles in the interest of agency
management of their assets.  John Moresko (Interior) stated that any reduction
of reporting burden would be appreciated.  Mr. Ginsberg noted that
accountability of agency reporting is valuable, but that FEMP is sensitive to
reporting burden.  Mr. McGovern (Treasury) stated that he would like to see law
enforcement exemption for any future goals.<p>

Mr. Klimkos referred the Task Force to a draft paragraph distributed with the
agenda:<p><ul>

Although the 10 percent reduction goal for gasoline and diesel fuel (mandated by
Executive Order 12759) ended in FY 1995, DOE will continue to collect
consumption data on these fuels as it has since 1975.  To relieve the reporting
burden on smaller agencies that consume only gasoline and diesel in passenger
vehicles, DOE will work the General Services Administration to capture that
consumption and cost data.  Larger agencies, which use gasoline, diesel, and
other fuels in vehicles and equipment for passenger transportation and other
purposes will continue to report consumption and cost data directly to DOE.  In
most cases, these agencies already have reporting systems in place to
accommodate this.</ul><p>  

Mr. Ginsberg anticipates the possibility of a new goal and returned the issue of
reporting changes to Mr. Klimkos.  Mr. Klimkos recommended keeping the same
reporting mechanism for FY 1996 and consider a new reporting mechanism for FY
1997.  The Task Force agreed to continue status quo for one more year.<p>

Annual Report Guidance<p>

Mr. Klimkos stated that the major revision in the FY 1996 reporting guidance
deals with reporting of gasoline and diesel fuel.  He again asked the Task Force
to review the paragraph distributed with the agenda.  The guidance will be
distributed to the agencies in mid-to-late June.  The FY 1995 draft Annual
Report will be distributed in late June/early July for agency review.<p>
 
Training Update<p>

Ted Collins (FEMP) invited the Task Force to attend a Training subcommittee
meeting on June 13th, 10 am to 12 noon, at the DOE Headquarters, Room 2E069. 
The meeting is being held to discuss declining enrollments for FEMP training and
assess FEMP training in light of agencies' current and future needs and budget
environments.<p>  

Later in the meeting Mr. Collins announced that FEMP is reducing training fees
for its workshops from $300 to $150.<p>

Outreach and Awards - Communication Plan<p>

Tatiana Muessel (FEMP) discussed the progress of the Interagency Five-Year
Communication Plan. Phase One, which identified message, audience, vision, and
goals, has been completed.  The second phase will focus on process and products. 
The plan will feature a two-track approach:  1) target energy managers
(implementation) and 2) target employees (energy awareness). Ms. Muessel asked
the Task Force to review the draft plan and provide comments.<p>

Ms. Muessel announced the theme for the TeleFEMP IV videoconference:  the
Greening of Federal Government.  The videoconference will be held during Energy
Awareness Month.  She also distributed samples of energy awareness computer
messages to the group.  Disk copies are available from DOE.<p>

The next meeting of the communications/outreach working group will be held on
June 11th from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm at DOE.<p>

Federal Energy and Water Management Awards<p>

Nellie Tibbs noted that, to date, she has received nominations from two
agencies.  Ms. Tibbs solicited the Task Force for evaluators.  The Awards
Ceremony will be November 14, 1996 at the National Press Club.  The
Congressional Reception will be tentatively held November 13, 1996 at the Hart
Senate Office Bldg., Room 902.  She noted that the number of people who can be
nominated as a small group will be limited to 10 or less.  Nominations submitted
under the category of small group with 10 or more people will be considered as
an organization.<p>

Mr. Ginsberg noted a new two-tiered evaluation process will reduce the burden on
the agency evaluators.  The local chapter of the Association of Energy Engineers
will screen the nominations.  Agency evaluators are needed for June 25th and
26th. Evaluators will not review their own agency's nominations.  It was noted
that the 656 Committee meeting is also scheduled for June 26th.<p>  

Procurement Challenge<p>

Aimee McKane (LBNL) discussed the status of the Procurement Challenge, beginning
with a review of its policy framework.  She distributed a draft agenda for a
public meeting to be held on June 5th at DOE's auditorium.  The meeting will
focus on Federal procurement to promote commercialization of energy efficient
products.<p>

Other activities undertaken in the area of procurement include:<p><ul>

<li>Development of a Basic Ordering Agreement for energy-efficient, non-CFC
chillers<br>
<li>Incorporation of the "EE" symbol in the GSA home appliance catalog<br>
<li>Outreach activities with State governments, Washington Metropolitan Council
of Governments, and the ACEEE '96, TEEM '96, and WEEC '96 conferences.<br>
<li>Electronic Commerce integration<br>
<li>90 percent completion of product recommendations ( in peer review)</ul><p>

John Guice, working with DOE Defense Programs, spoke about the Basic Ordering
Agreement (BOA)  for energy-efficient, non-CFC chillers.  This procurement
mechanism will be available in August 1996 and will allow for the customization
of the units, and the purchase, set-up, multi-year service, and maintenance.  He
distributed the draft specifications for the BOA to the Task Force.  Major
advantages of the BOA include reduction of engineering and procurement time and
the flexibility to allow for customization of the units.<p>

Vic Petrolati (DOE) asked if control systems are part of the BOA.  Mr. Guice
responded that it is available as an option.  Mr. Guice gave the Task Force his
e-mail address for more information:  john.guice@dp.doe.gov.  GSA will
disseminate the BOA when it is completed.<p>

Renewable Energy Working Group<p>

Anne Sprunt Crawley (FEMP) updated the Task Force on the activities of the
Renewable Energy Working Group.  The Renewable Energy Working Group
Implementation Plan has been approved and signed by the following
agencies:<ul><p> 

<li>Department of Agriculture<br>
<li>Department of Commerce,<br>
<li>Department of Defense,<br>
<li>Department of Energy,<br>
<li>General Services Administration,<br>
<li>Department of Health & Human Services,<br>
<li>Department of the Interior,<br>
<li>National Aeronautics and Space Administration,<br>
<li>Department of State,<br>
<li>Department of Transportation<br>
<li>Department of the Treasury, and<br>
<li>Department of Veterans Affairs.</ul><p>

Ms. Crawley announced that there is a meeting of the Working Group scheduled for
June 6th, 9 am to 12 noon at the offices of the Solar Energy Industries Council
at 122 C St., NW.  The meeting will focus on wind technology.  Ms. Crawley is
the contact person (202-586-1505).<p>

The Center for Solar Technology and Renewable Resources (CSTRR) at the Nevada
Test Site is sponsoring an informational meeting June 24th in Las Vegas, NV. 
Mr. Ginsberg asked the Task Force to invite their regional representatives to
attend.<p>

Showcase Buildings<p>

Ms. Crawley reported on the Showcase Building Program in Karen Thomas (NREL)
absence.  She distributed handouts listing the text of the showcase plaques for
the designated showcase buildings.  She noted that agencies still have
opportunities to designate new showcases.<p>

SAVEnergy Update<p>

Ms. Crawley announced that Karen Thomas will take over for Katherine Mayo as
director of the SAVEnergy audit program.  To streamline management of the audit
process, two FEMP contacts have been designated to receive audit applications. 
Paul King of the DOE Boston Regional Support Office (617-565-9712) will accept
applications from facilities east of the Mississippi River.  Randy Jones of the
DOE Denver Regional Support Office (303-275-4814) will accept applications from
facilities west of the Mississippi River.  The application forms must be
submitted through regional coordinator first.<p>

Measurement & Verification Guidelines<p>

Brad Gustafson (LBNL) briefed the Task Force on the three main protocols for
measurement and verification of energy savings:<p><ol>

<li>North American Energy Measurement and Verification Protocol, the DOE/private
industry developed overarching guideline.  Available through the Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC), 800-363-3732.<p>

<li>Federal Energy Management Programs M&V Guidelines, for Federal projects. 
Available through EREC, 800-363-3732 or can be downloaded from
http://www.eren.doe.gov/ femp/new_MVdoc.html.<p>

<li>ASHRAE GPC-14P is working on a standard for which information is planned to
be available at http://www.ashrae.org.</ol><p>

ESPC Update<p>

Tanya Sadler (FEMP) announced the available of the draft Request for Proposals
for the "Super Energy Savings Performance Contract" to be piloted in the western
states.  The final RFP should be available in 2 to 3 weeks.  The contract will
have a 3-year base period with two 3-year option periods.<p>

Green Lights Update<p>

Gwen Taylor (EPA) briefed the Task Force on the proposed memorandum of
understanding between DOE, EPA, and agencies that will allow agency
participation in EPA's Green Lights program.  The goal of the MOU is to fold in
Green Lights program requirements into Federal energy management activities
currently being undertaken by the agencies.  There is no increase in reporting
requirements beyond what agencies currently report to DOE and no requirement to
re-survey facilities.<p>

A similar MOU is also proposed for agency participation in the Energy Star
Buildings Program.  EPA will make available tools such as Quick Fan and Quick
Chill software for identifying profitable upgrades and The Scheduler for project
and budget planning.<p>

Bill McGovern (Treasury) asked if the MOU is targeted at the Departmental level
or if individual agencies or bureaus under a Department would need to sign on as
well.  Ms. Taylor responded that the MOU is intended for the Departmental or
agency headquarters level but that a Department could exempt certain bureaus
from the program if necessary.<p>

Representatives of the following agencies expressed agreement in principle with
the goals of the Green Lights/Energy Star MOUs and are ready to recommend
signing by their agencies:<p><ul>

<li>Department of State<br>
<li>Department of the Treasury<br>
<li>Department of Transportation<br>
<li>Social Security Administration<br>
<li>Department of Commerce<br>
<li>US Postal Service<br>
<li>NASA</ul><p>

Budget Issues<p>

Mark Ginsberg led a brief discussion of issues surrounding the FY 1997 budget. 
He noted that Congressman John Kasich has introduced an amendment that would
eliminate the Department of Energy's budget for energy efficiency and renewable
energy by the year 1999.  The House recommends budget levels below those of
1996.  Interior and Energy and Water subcommittees have also provided guidance
to reduce the budget of DOE EE.  FEMP's budget request for core activities is
$33 million and $5.7 million for in-house energy management.<p>

American Gas Association Issues<p>

John Archibald (Deputy Director, FEMP) briefed the Task Force on three issues
raised by the American Gas Association<p>

Use of EIA Gas Price Data<p>

The computer program, BLCC, used to assist agencies in doing cost evaluations of
energy projects incorporates EIA projections for natural gas and other energy
prices.  AGA would prefer that the EIA data was not used but will accept a
warning to the users that  their best estimate of local rates should be
substituted as a first option with EIA rates used in the absence of local rates. 
This issue was addressed in a recent issue of the FEMP Focus which made
available the latest EIA price projections.  In the future, the schedule for the
release of BLCC will be adjusted to cooincide with the release of EIA's latest
projections.<p>

Anti-Gas Provision in Code of Federal Regulations<p>

CFR now says, under the old requirement for developing General Operations Plans,
that Federal agencies energy management plans should promote:  ". . .switching
for petroleum fuels and natural gas to coal and other energy sources. . .and. .
.shifting energy use from oil and natural gas to other fuels in more plentiful
supply from domestic sources . . .".   FEMP has commenced a rule making to
eliminate the requirement for the 10-Year Plans which would eliminate the
"anti-gas" statements.<p>
  

Site vs. Source Calculation of BTU Consumption<p>

All agencies report progress against legislated and Executive Order energy
savings goals based on energy savings measured at the site where the energy is
put to use, i.e., at the Federal sites.  This differs from the total effect of
energy saved at the power plant which produced the energy for consumption at the
Federal site, i.e., source energy.  Currently, source energy use is estimated
based on average conversion and delivery efficiencies for the electric and steam
energy.  It is reported in an appendix to the Annual Report to Congress.<p>

In a fuel-switching application where natural gas is substituted for electric
energy, energy savings, measured in BTU per gross square foot, would not occur
when measured at the site but large savings would occur when measured at the
source.  Facilities which are attempting to meet their agency's energy savings
goals might be discouraged from making the change to gas because it would
reflect an increase in site energy use rather than energy savings.  It is
possible the facility would reject the fuel switch even though there would be
cost savings to the Government.  AGA feels this results in a bias against
natural gas, limits the options of the energy manager to choose among competing
fuels, and denies energy managers the opportunity for large energy cost savings. 
AGA recommends that energy decisions be made on the basis of cost savings.<p>

Mr. Archibald proposes two options for addressing this concern:<p><ol>

<li>Increase text emphasis in the Annual Report that discusses the conversion of
site to source energy and highlight the Federal sector energy reduction using
source energy.  This will increase understanding of Federal sector efforts to
achieve energy goals when measured at the source of generation. However, by
measuring progress toward the goals on a source-measured basis will show an
increase in energy use of 1.4% rather than a reduction of 11.2% when measured at
site.<p>

<li>Work with Interagency Energy Management Task Force and 656 Committee to
issue a policy statement to achieve cost savings through fuel switching when
either site energy or source energy decreases.  This will allow cost savings to
be achieved without conflicting with energy savings goals. However, this adds
complexity to decisions of thousands of energy managers.</ol><p>

Federal Utility Partnership Working Group<p>

Louis Harris (FEMP) announced that a Federal Utility Partnership Working Group
meeting would be held on June 27th and 28th in New York City.  He distributed
registration forms to the Task Force.<p>

Upcoming Meetings<p>

The 656 Committee meeting is scheduled for June 26th from 9 am to 12 noon. DOE
is looking into holding it at the Old Executive Office Building.<p> 

The next Task Force meeting will be held the last week of July or first week of
August.<p>

The meeting adjourned at 12 noon.<p>
