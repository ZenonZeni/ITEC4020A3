(1) SENATOR BURNS GOES ONLINE TO DISCUSS PRIVACY AND SECURITY ON THE NET

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) joined Netizens in an online town meeting last
night (Monday 5/6) to discuss the recently introduced Promotion of Commerce
Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996 (S. 1726). Senator Burns
also discussed the importance of his bill to the future of privacy and
security on the Internet and the need to encourage the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use encryption technologies.

Excerpts of the 50 minute discussion are printed below. The full transcript
of the event is available at the Encryption Policy Resource Page:

By bringing together a United States Senator and interested Internet users
in a discussion of an important Internet policy issue, last night's event
illustrates the value of the Net in the political process and the growing
importance of the net.community as a political constituency.  Several more
similar events are planned for the coming weeks (see scheduling information
below).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) EXCERPTS FROM MONDAY NIGHT'S TOWN MEETING

The entire transcript is available at http://www.crypto.com/

Question   : Senator Burns, As a small business in Montana that
             provides web-space to local Montana
             businesses, I'm concerned that the lack of privacy
             and security on the Net will keep many of my
             potential customers from purchasing online. How will
             this bill help?

Sen Burns  : That's exactly why I introduced this bill. Right now
             I don't think any of us feel safe ...
             transmitting our credit card numbers over the
             Internet, and many companies ...
             who have workers around the nation or world are
             worried about how they can safely send ...
             sensitive information back and forth between them. If
             we can raise their level ...
             of security, we can guarantee that that information
             will be sent without unwanted eyes ...
             looking in.


Question   : How will these new crypto bills (PRO-CODE, S.1587, HR
             3011) affect the administration's
                 concerns in the areas of counter terrorism, counter
             narcotics, etc? (Columbia, MD)

Sen Burns  : Well, the point is that these terrorists already have
             access to strong encryption ...
             from other companies around the world. I mean, my
             heavens, you can download it ...
             right over the Internet now. I expect we will have
             conversations with the FBI, with NSA ..
             to address their concerns. But this technology is
             like a lot of other things out there ...
             It can be used for good purposes, but it also can be
             misused. I don't think we want to ...
             ban kitchen knives just because a few evil-doers out
             there are misusing them.


Question   : What do you think the Administration, FBI, and NSA reaction
             to your bill will be? Have you already heard from them?
             (I run an ISP in Missoula, Montana.)

Sen Burns  : We expect them to have some concern with this, and we will
             work with them but we have to understand that the people we
             are concerned with can already gain encryption that is
             already longer than 40 bits on the international market.
