Aerodyne Research, Inc. has provided research and development services to clients working to solve national and international problems since 1970. We contribute understanding of and solutions to critical issues such as global and regional environmental quality and the development of clean, efficient energy and propulsion sources. We design improved remote sensing, surveillance, image processing, tracking and assessment systems for the national defense. We also develop advanced materials and devises for electronic, electro-optical, environmental and energy applications.<P>

The Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Change group at Aerodyne performs laboratory and field experiments, designs and uses mathematical models, and develops and utilizes advanced field measurement techniques to understand the sources, environmental transformations and environmental fate of pollutants and biospheric emissions.<P>

Our DOE SBIR grant for the development of an Ozone Flux Meter has contributed to the development of technologies with applications in: measurement of sources of radiatively important trace species (RITS), acid gas depositions, air pollution characterization; remote monitoring of gas phase pollutants over highways, landfills, and hazardous waste disposal sites; as well as wide area surveys from airborne and/or van mounted platforms.<P>

Aerodyne Research follows two-pronged approach to developing its technology-based product business. We produce and market the highly complex, low volume products ourselves and arrange with other well-positioned firms to produce and market our less complex, high volume products. Our DOE SBIR lead, in part, to the development of our atmospheric trace gas detector systems and our astigmatic multi-pass absorption cell.<P>

The full diode laser trace gas detector system can instantaneously detect part-per-billion concentrations of many trace gases in the atmosphere. We have sold several of these systems to western European research institutions. We have also provided a trace gas detector for our own use in NASA-sponsored studies of the environmental impact of aircraft exhaust.<P>

An innovative optical component developed under the SBIR program is our astigmatic multi-pass absorption cell ("AMAC"). We have been issues an United States Patent (number 5,291,265) covering the AMAC technology. We fully developed two versions of the AMAC into standard products. After producing and selling several AMAC units ourselves, we established a licensing arrangement with NEW FOCUS, Inc., a major optical supply house, under which they produce, market, and distribute the AMAC units. NEW FOCUS, Inc. placed the AMAC in its winter 1995 catalog and has been experiencing increasing sales.<P>

Our DOE Ozone Flux Meter SBIR has led to the development of a series of trace gas detectors, and has led to the following accomplishments:<P>

Patent Award: "Off Axis Cavity Absorption Cell", #5,291,265, P.L. Kebabian (March 1, 1994)<P>
Trace Gas Detector System Sales: International revenues in excess of $1 million.<P>
Astigmatic Multi-pass Absorption Cell Sales and Licensing Agreement: NEW FOCUS, Inc.<P>
