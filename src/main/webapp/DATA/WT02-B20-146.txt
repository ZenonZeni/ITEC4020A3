<b>A National Evaluation of Residential Camp Programs Serving Persons with
Disabilities</b><br>


GRANT NUMBER: H023C30002 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:   The project will conduct a national evaluation of residential camp programs serving
persons with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  The investigation will include 14 residential school and/or summer camp programs
serving children with disabilities, to include a total of roughly 1,500-2,000 total cases
nationwide. 
A pre-post measurement will be employed to determine campers' affective growth resulting from
their exposure to residential camp programming.  These measurements will be conducted by
parents and caregivers to better measure program generalization and impact beyond the camp
experience.  A second test will be administered to determine effects of particular components of
outdoor programming on skill acquisition of campers.  A case study approach will also be
employed using interviews and observations of a representative sample of campers from each
regional site.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The study will contribute significantly to the understanding of
the
value of planned outdoor programming for children with disabilities, address the benefits of
residential camping experiences for persons with varying levels of disability, and provide
professionals with validated and comprehensive procedures for evaluating residential camp
programs serving children with disabilities.<P>

ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will determine the feasibility of implementing a School Support System
approach to monitoring that continues to examine compliance with regulatory requirements,
evaluates the effectiveness of
special education programs and services, and identifies and provides technical assistance and
support.<P>

METHOD:  Following a thorough review of the literature (including other state practices and a
survey of service providers), staff will review local education agency (LEA) statements of
assurances to comply with regulatory requirements.  The LEA application process will also be
reviewed to minimize repetition in describing how regulatory requirements are to be met.  School
Support System data gathering instruments will be examined and a database will be created
containing information to be gathered using these instruments.  School Support Team members
will be surveyed concerning the effectiveness of compliance data gathering instruments.  The
available literature on the attainment of IEP goals as indicators of effectiveness will then be
examined, and a review will be conducted of other states' activities in determining indicators of
program and service effectiveness.  Five regional focus groups will be established in the state,
and
group reviews and discussions of potential indicators of effectiveness will be conducted.  A
sample of effectiveness indicators will thus be developed, and effectiveness data collection
instruments will be prepared and implemented.  The data collected through these instruments
will
be compiled and analyzed, and findings will be reviewed with members of School Support
Teams.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The School Support System will provide for continued LEA
compliance with regulatory requirements while incorporating an evaluation of service
effectiveness with a focus on benefits to students.  A mechanism to identify needs and provide
technical assistance and supports to the LEA with a focus on systemic change will also be
included. <P>

<b>Goals 2000 and the Inclusion of Students with Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023U40001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:<br>
ENDING DATE: <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE: As requested under Section 1015 of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, this
project is intended to conduct a "comprehensive study of the inclusion of children with
disabilities
in school reform activities assisted under the [Act]."<P>

METHOD:  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will establish a Study Committee of up to
15 experts which will design and carry out a set of activities, including conducting site visits,
holding a workshop, and commissioning scholarly papers.  Components will include: (1) An
evaluation of the National Education Goals and objectives, curriculum reforms, standards, and
other programs intended to achieve the goals.  The intent will be to ask how less emphasis can be
placed on process requirements and more on program quality, while maintaining adequate
safeguards.  (2) A review of assessments and measures, and other methods to collect data on
educational progress of students with disabilities.  Issues may include whether separate
standards,
thresholds, outcomes, or assessments should be developed for some students with disabilities; the
comparability of modified and unmodified assessments, "flagging" of modified assements;
adapting performance-based assessments.  (3) An examination of what incentives or assistance
might be provided to states to develop improvement plans that adequately address the needs of
children with disabilities.  Issues will include incentives to classify children as disabled and
various
instructional and organizational approaches. 4) The relation of Goals 2000 to other federal laws. 
Issues will include comparisons of Goals 2000 and IDEA and how they can be brought into
greater harmony.  (5) Such other items as NAS considers appropriate.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As required by the Act, The National Academy of Sciences will
submit an interim report of its findings and recommendations to the President and Congress not
later than 12 months from the beginning of the project, and the final report not later than 24
months from the date.<P>

<b>A Study to Determine the Current Levels of Outcome Attainment of Students with Specific
Learning Disabilities (SLD) and Students with Severe Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H159A40007 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to establish a baseline data pool with which to
demonstrate the current level of outcomes attained by North Carolina students served under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).<P>

METHOD:  The first year of the study will focus on two groups of students with disabilities
(students with learning disabilities and students with severe impairments).  The second project
year will expand the study to include all students receiving services under IDEA.  Data will be
collected across the following domains: (1) participation outcomes; (2) enabling outcomes; (3)
academic outcomes; and (4) post-school outcomes.  A previously conducted feasibility study has
indicated that these data can be collected with reliability using the AUEN system.  Six North
Carolina school systems have been invited to participate in the project, three of which
participated
in the previous feasibility study.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The long-range goal of the project is to establish a state-wide
evaluation system to be used by all public schools in North Carolina.  With this system, the
public
schools of North Carolina will be able to make judgements about the effectiveness of their
programs for special needs students and make decisions for improving ineffective programs.<P>

BEGINNING DATE:  3/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  2/28/98 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will establish and implement a research agenda designed to investigate
state and local education efforts to implement the transition requirements in the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).<P>

METHOD:  The University of Vermont Center for Transition and Employment, the University
of
Illinois Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation, the University of
Minnesota
National Transition Network, and the National Association of State Directors of Special
Education (NASDSE) are collaborating in this three-year effort to establish and implement a
research agenda designed to investigate state and local education efforts to implement the
transition requirements in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  The overall
project will consist of five separate substudies.  Substudy 1 will employ a survey of 58 state and
territorial directors of special education and 500 local directors of special education to acquire
information on the range and variation in state and local policies related to the definitional
components of transition services.  Substudy 2 will use a longitudinal follow-up of 200 randomly
selected students in their last year of schooling to document the nature and extent of their
participation in transition planning and explore the relationship between their participation and
the
resulting post-school outcomes approximately one year after leaving school.  Substudy 3 will use
expert review and case studies to identify context and salient characteristics (e.g.  policy,
organizational structures, funding, staffing, professional development, evaluation, interagency
collaboration, leadership, advocacy, instruction and curriculum) that define exemplary
implementation of transition services and promote positive outcomes for youth with disabilities. 
Substudy 4 will combine the survey in Substudy 1 and the longitudinal data in Substudy 2 to
examine interagency involvement at federal, state, and local levels.  In addition, an issues forum
will be used to identify impediments to and strategies for improving interagency involvement at
state, federal, and local levels.  Substudy 5 will conduct a policy analysis to identify federal
program services and policies which are relevant to the design and delivery of transition services
and fulfill the requirements of IDEA.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products developed as a result of these investigations will
include: descriptive materials such as brochures and news releases, articles in national, regional,
and state level newsletters, project publications including research reports, policy briefs and case
studies, journal articles and book chapters, and workshop and conference presentations. <P>

<b>A Full Evaluation Study of the Oregon Supported Education Plan and Its Impact Upon
Student
Outcomes</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H159A40016 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine the effects of recent Oregon restructuring reforms and
their impact on the inclusion of all students in regular education settings.<P>

METHOD:  The Full Evaluation Study will continue to refine an assessment process developed
during the feasibility study and then use the process to measure direct student outcomes.  The
process will use: (1) the Oregon Portfolio Assessment System; (2) extant student assessment
data;
and (3) school records.  Staff will also conduct two multiple-site descriptive case studies (at
elementary and secondary levels) using these sources to document the impact of supported
education on the direct student outcomes of students with and without IEPs.  An analysis of the
relative impact of supported education "implementation factors" on student outcomes will be
conducted, integrating professional staff/parent respondent data with direct student outcome data
to create a set of multidimensional dependent variables for analysis.  The project will also
pilot-test and provide feedback to the ODE about their development of the Oregon Portfolio
Assessment system for use with students with IEPs, thus continuing the important process of
integrating long-range statewide plans.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A full evaluation report will document each of the following:
findings of the study related to the impact of supported education implementation factors on
outcomes for students with and without IEPs; the development of a process to monitor the effects
of supported education on students with and without IEPs; and recommendations regarding the
use of Oregon's Portfolio Assessment Process with students with IEPs. <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate the feasibility of developing a system for collecting
student outcome data that can be integrated into the current Colorado state compliance
monitoring process.<P>

METHOD:  Following a literature review, staff will identify desired long- and short-term
outcomes, which will then be organized into a matrix of possible student outcomes based on the
Expanded Curriculum model.  Focus groups will be held with special education administrators,
service providers, and consumers to identify the most useful student outcomes to measure.  A list
of appropriate instruments to measure these outcomes will follow.  Project staff will then identify
currently available student outcome data and identify and pilot-test new data collection
instruments and procedures for needed additional student outcome data.  These will include
difficult student tasks, formats for IEP data collection, student participation checklists, and
functional skills evaluation checklists, all of which will be targeted specifically for students with
serious emotional disturbances, learning disabilities, or mental retardation.  These instruments
will
then be compiled and integrated into existing systems of data collection prior to planning of the
collective computer program.  This program will finally be pilot-tested and its overall efficacy
will
be evaluated.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Anticipated products of this research include: (1) a conceptual
framework and instruments for measuring social, student, and functional life competency
outcomes; (2) a battery of data collection instruments on outcomes common to all students with
invisible disabilities and those unique for students identified with serious emotional disturbances,

BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine four school choice options that may be enabling children
with disabilities to reach successful outcomes.<P>

METHOD:  Options to be explored include two established options (second chance programs
and
postsecondary options) as well as two emerging options (charter schools and home schooling). 
Qualitative methodologies will be used to examine the experiences of students with disabilities in
all options, and quantitative methodologies will be used in measuring outcomes for students in
second chance and postsecondary options in comparison to those who do not participate.  The
study will also examine how charter schools and families participating in home schooling
educate
students identified as having a disability, as well as the potential impact of these practices on
students and special education.  After separate studies of all four options, a fifth study will
integrate all findings in order to enable policymakers and educators to make informed decisions
about the possibilities of school choice options and the attainment of outcomes for students with
disabilities.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products will include the customary research reports and journal
articles.  In addition, staff will develop products that present the findings in an user-friendly
format. These products will include policy briefs, short reports, and fact sheets.  Similar products

PURPOSE:  This project will establish a Center to support the achievement of world class
outcomes for Students with Disabilities. The Center will assist states in implementing activities
for
students with disabilities and document states' efforts in these areas.<P>

METHOD:  The Center will conduct three interrelated strands of activity: (1) Documentation and
Analysis; (2) Information Exchange and Dissemination; and (3) Technical Assistance (TA).  Key
activities in the Documentation and Analysis strand will include documenting the participation of
students with disabilities in state and national assessments, the secondary analysis of outcome
data
for students with disabilities, the documentation of state and national standards-setting activities,
and the tracking of the participation of students with disabilities in state Goals 2000 plans. 
Strand
2 activities will include production and dissemination of products, facilitating information
exchange among researchers and developers, infusing the disability perspective into a variety of
materials used by general and special educators, networking and linking with parents, advocacy
groups and other organizations, and telecommunications networking.  The scope of technical
assistance activities will encompass provision of direct TA to states, work with regional resource
centers, and work with other technical assistance providers.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The Center will contribute to current knowledge and practice,
lead to improved services for infants, toddlers, children and youth with disabilities, and provide
state and national audiences with information on the impact and effectiveness of programs and
services provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Planned products for
dissemination will include information reports, update reports, recommendation reports,
directories of projects and resources, lists of relevant publications, press releases, and
publications
in other periodicals.<P>
