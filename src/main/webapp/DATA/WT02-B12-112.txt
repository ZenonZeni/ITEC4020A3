PGP-voice, hmm where is the Clipper chip? <p>

From: grady@netcom.com (Grady Ward) <p>

It looks like PGP-voice is going to happen sooner than later. <p>

Posted on sumex-aim.stanford.edu is a demo version of 2Way Talker
a utility that permits full-duplex conversations with any other
Macintosh on an AppleTalk network.  This includes WANS connected
with modems and Apple Remote Access. <p>

And it works without requiring *any* additional hardware since Macs
nowadays have microphones as well as speakers built in. <p>

Implementing full public key controlled conversations is now just a
matter of exchanging RSA keys and doing IDEA on the AppleTalk packets
on the fly.  Technically trivial. <p>

It's almost here, folks. <p>

This is turning out even better and more available to the masses than
I thought it would... with V.fast modems and PowerPCs this is *really*
going to be great. <p>
