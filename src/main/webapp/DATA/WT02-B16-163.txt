        <h2 align="center"><strong>Use of Trademarks</strong></h2>
        <p>Brand and product names used in this directory are
        trademarks of their respective companies. Rather than put
        a trademark symbol after every occurrence of a
        trademarked name, the directory uses the names in an
        editorial fashion only, and to the benefit of the
        trademark owner, with no intention of infringement of the
        trademark. To the extent possible, the directory
        distinguishes proprietary trademarks from descriptive
        terms by following the capitalization styles used by the
        trademark owner.</p>
