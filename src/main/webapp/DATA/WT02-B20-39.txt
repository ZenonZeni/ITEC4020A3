<B><I> Do you have any information on attention deficit disorder and children who are gifted</b></i>?

</B></I><P>Recently, an increasing number of gifted children have been identified or diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder, with or without hyperactivity.  This dramatic increase is somewhat disturbing, and has been explained in many different ways including greater awareness on the part of educational professionals and improved diagnostic techniques.  However, ADD in gifted students is difficult to assess because so many of the behavioral characteristics are similar to those associated with giftedness or creativity.  A child who is gifted may have ADD.  Without a thorough professional evaluation, including a physical examination by a physician, it is hard to tell.<P>

This file includes information about gifted students and ADD.  At the end of this file are links to Internet resources and Internet listservs (discussion groups) where you can obtain more specific information on this topic.  There may be an ERIC digest that provides further information on this topic.  You can read the full text of ERIC EC digests under our listing at

ADD Gifted: How Many Labels Can One Child Take?<BR>
Delisle, James<BR>
Gifted Child Today Magazine, v18 n2 p42-43 Mar-Apr   1995<BR>

Journal Announcement: CIJAUG95<BR>
Target Audience: Practitioners<BR>
This paper argues that the Attention Deficit Disorder/Gifted (ADD/Gifted)
label is both unfair and overused, discounts the possibility of natural
developmental lags, and focuses on the child's weaknesses.  A call is made for
seeking a full understanding of contextual, curricular, and environmental
factors outside the child before labeling students.  (PB)<BR>

This journal theme issue focuses on mainstreaming of gifted children.  "How
Gifted Kids Can Survive in 'Inclusion' Classrooms" by Susan Winebrenner offers
guidelines for compacting and differentiating the curriculum for gifted
students within the regular classroom setting.  It also addresses guiding
independent study.  "Challenging Ben" by Barbara Gilman and Linda Greene
recounts one child's individualized programming including ability
identification, classroom modifications, and issues of course and grade
acceleration.  "Hidden Gifted Learner: Creativity and Attention Deficit
Disorder" by Deidre V. Lovecky summarizes characteristics of gifted students
with ADD and stresses the importance of using students' creative strengths.
"Instructional Perspectives: Mainstreaming and the Gifted Child" by Shirley W.
Schiever questions whether the regular class setting is, in fact, the least
restrictive environment for gifted students.  Regular columns review children's
books and address the issues of school choice, and picture books as art museums.

gifted children.  "Gifted Children with Attention Deficit Disorder" by Deirdre
V. Lovecky outlines symptoms of ADD, types of ADD, issues of giftedness,
strengths of gifted children with ADD, and methods for helping gifted children
with ADD.  "The Perplexed Perfectionist" by George W. Dorry accepts the
positive and negative sides of perfectionism, notes the high personal and
interpersonal expectations of gifted children with attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and describes treatment of these children by
encouraging them to accept approximations of the perfect solution to a problem
and by building steps of new learning that help the child to step away from
dependence gradually.  A special feature titled "ADHD or Gifted?" presents a
dialogue with Sharon Lind and Linda Silverman which reviews 13 questions
parents and teachers should ask to determine the child's need for special
services.  Regular columns discuss revisiting childhood, the dangers of
ignoring the gifted, literature resources, creative ventures, and turnabout
children.  (JDD)<BR>

This fact sheet summarizes information on children who have an attention
deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD), are gifted, or are both ADHD and
gifted.  Fourteen diagnostic criteria for ADHD from the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III are listed.  A comparison of
behaviors associated with ADHD and with giftedness is offered, noting the many
similarities.  Parents and teachers are urged to consider the situation and
setting of problematic behaviors, noting that children with ADHD typically
exhibit problem behaviors in all settings (both at home and at school) whereas
gifted children are most likely to exhibit such behaviors in situations where
they are bored or waiting for other students.  Other differences noted include
a long attention span (when interested) by gifted students and a greater
variability in task performance by children with ADHD.  Careful evaluation is
urged for students who may be both gifted/talented and ADHD.  (DB)<BR>

This paper examines characteristics of a typical 6-year-old and
characteristics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including
distractibility, impulsiveness, inattention, and hyperactivity.  The occurrence
of ADHD in gifted students is discussed.  Possible causes of ADHD are noted.
The 5 "M" program of treatment is presented, which involves: (1) medication
with stimulants to help the student pay attention; (2) management using
behavior modification techniques, which included acknowledging adherence to
classroom rules, teaching self-monitoring of behavior, allowing children to
help design classroom rules, and using rewards and punishments to reinforce
rules; (3) modification of the classroom environment to meet student needs; (4)
modeling appropriate behavior; and (5) mothering (and fathering, too ), which
calls for unconditional love and acceptance of the child, as ADHD children must
perceive that they are loved if they are to accept themselves.  The paper
concludes that through steady support and management, the gifted ADHD child is
not only teachable, but can provide a great deal of positive stimulation to the
classroom environment.  (JDD)<BR>

Comprehensive diagnosis of the learning abilities of gifted students with
attention deficit disorder can be accomplished using the Structure of Intellect
(SOI) tests, which distinguish giftedness and disability.  SOI uses a wholistic
approach to analyze student performance, and offers strategies for developing
remedial educational programming.  Two cases are briefly presented.
