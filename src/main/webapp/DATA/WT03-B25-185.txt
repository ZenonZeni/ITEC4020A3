<I>Fast &amp; Accurate Boring: </I>
<P> Microns Are Just a Click Away

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
Kennametal has been judiciously supplying the Romicron boring system to a few companies during the 
past couple of years and has made  some adjustments (e.g., high-pressure through-tool coolant). <BR>
Now it is being launched to everyone else. Here's a look.

<P>Because a casting has comparatively immense amounts of time and money invested in it by the time it is ready for 
boring, that operation calls for considerable care. That means setup is crucial. That, in turn, ordinarily means that comparatively long setup times are involved to get the tool positioned just right. To be sure, high accuracies can be obtained through the use of a variety of available boring systems. But a question is the amount of time that it takes to get things just right.

<P>What if figuratively &quot;dialing in&quot; a boring head to dead-on accuracy was also literally doing so? (And by &quot;dead-on&quot; we mean precision up to two microns [.000079 in].)

<P>Evidently, this is precisely the case with the Romicron fine boring system. Kennametal Inc. (Latrobe, PA), has 
the worldwide exclusive rights to this system, developed and patented by Giordano Romi, president of Industrias Romi 
S.A., a major South American machine tool and plastics machinery builder. Necessity was the mother of invention.

<P>The issue, according to Doug Moore, Kennametal Romicron product manager, is one of time. &quot;People are always making adjustments to and fiddling with boring setups to get the right size,&quot; he says. What makes the 
Romicron system--which consists of 12 heads covering bores from 0.40 to 12.8 in.--unique (so unique that apparently, 
when Mr. Romi first went to the U.S. Patent Office, the reviewer there didn't think that it would work, so Mr. Romi came back with a 100:1 model and showed him; the patent was granted) is that in order to make an adjustment of 0.5 micron on a radius, it is a matter of turning a dial: Click. There it is. A 0.5 micron adjustment. The operator can <I>hear</I> the click. <I>Feel</I> the click. And, of course, look at the dial and <I>see</I> that the necessary adjustment has been made. This adjustment can be made in a matter of a few seconds. &quot;At the beginning of our association with the product,&quot; Moore admits, &quot;I 
was dazzled at the 0.5 micron on the radius and 1 micron on the diameter. I thought that maybe this would mean the elimination of some grinding operations. But then I realized that it wasn't the most special aspect. Lots of 
boring systems will get you that accuracy. The big deal is that you can get it in seconds.&quot;

<P>They've run some numbers on a spread sheet to figure out what this can mean to high volume manufacturers of components like transmissions (bore diameters for cases), pistons (pin diameters) and engine blocks (cylinder 
bores). Assuming a three-shift, seven-day, 50-week-a-year operation with a couple of adjustments an hour, and a burden rate of $50 to $60 per hour, they calculate that payback for the Romicron can be achieved in just under two months. The key to this is the time factor. Assuming that this is running on a machining center and so it is a matter of stopping the machine, opening the doors, making the click(s), and resuming, a sequence that takes about 30 seconds, this is the kind of return that Moore says can be realized. He says that the same thing with a conventional boring system--including Kennametal's own--would take two minutes. The price for the Romicron system? &quot;It isn't the highest, but it is higher than what people have paid for general boring in the past,&quot; Moore says. Units start at about $1,200 and go to $4,000. Two points: (1) part print tolerances aren't what they were in the past and (2) the payback figures still hold.

<P>One manufacturer discovered that there was an even bigger payback: whereas it had anticipated requiring a 
boring mill for a piston operation, with the Romicron it could get the required results right on the machining center.
