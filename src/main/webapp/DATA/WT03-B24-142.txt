<TITLE>Pat's Pointer to US Federal Government</TITLE>

<body>
This page provides pointers to the US Federal Government resources on the WEB.
This reflects the current status, which is quite an expansion from what
the founding fathers expected. Blame all the growth on the New Deal
Democrats.
<H1>Overall Structure</h1>
As every kid learns in civics class, the US Federal government was
delibrately split into three branches.
<p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./exec.html">Executive Branch</a> from the President 
on down. Note that most of the what folks think of as "government" is here.
<li><a href="./congress.html">Legislative</a> all those congresscritters.
<li><a href="./judicial.html">Judicial</A> all those judges.
</ol>
While usualy part of the Executive branch, the spooks are interesting to
a lot of folks, so I give them a 
<a href="./spook.html">special spook section.</a>
<P>
