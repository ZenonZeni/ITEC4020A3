<h3>THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS - 29 Sept. to 1 Nov. 1996</h3> 

The 
<a href="http://www.norvol.hi.is/bard3.html">Nordic 
Volcanological Institute</a>, gave the first reports of this eruption:<br>
<br>              
"On September 29, 1996 at 10:48 an earthquake of magnitude 5 on the Richter 
scale was detected within the Vatnajökull icecap in SE Iceland. This event 
was followed by an intense earthquake swarm with a large number of small 
events with intermittent larger quakes of magnitude 3-4 on the Richter 
scale. In the morning of October 1st an over flight 
discovered <A HREF="sig2m.jpg">a subsidence bowl</A> 
and <a href="jokullm.jpg">cracks</a> in the glacier surface 
at a location where an eruption had occurred in 1938. On Oct 2nd, in the 
early morning, an over flight observed that
<A HREF="gos1m.jpg"> an eruption</A>
 had broken through the ice. Rhythmic 
explosions resulted in black ash clouds rising to a height of 500 m while 
the buoyant <A HREF="plume.gif">eruption</A> column rose to 3000 m. 
<p>
The <A HREF="vatnajok.gif">Vatnajökull ice sheet [USGS Landsat 1 MSS 
image]</A> is a temperate glacier covering about 8300 km2 
in the SE part of Iceland. Volcanic fissure systems of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge plate boundary 
are partly covered by the western part of the ice sheet. Two major volcanic centers lie 
beneath the ice, the Bardarbunga volcanic centre and the Grimsvotn volcanic centre both 
with large subglacial caldera depressions. The last eruption within the Bardarbunga centre 
occurred in 1910, but eruptions on the fissure system have occurred in 871 AD, 1477 AD and 
1862 AD, all producing substantial amounts of lava. The Grimsvotn centre is the more active 
of the two with an eruption frequency during past centuries close to one eruption per decade. 
The last eruption occurred in 1983.  As Bardarbunga the Grimsvotn centre is a part of a a fissure 
system which includes the Laki fissure, which in 1783 produced about 12-14 km3 of basaltic lava. 
Within the ice filled Grimsvotn caldera intense geothermal activity continuously melts the ice to 
form a subglacial lake, which at intervals of 5 to 10 years is emptied along subglacial channels 
to create large floods (jökulhlaup) on the alluvial plain, Skeidararsandur 
(literally "Spoon River Sands"), 
on the Icelandic south 
coast. The lake was last emptied in 1995 and the water level is presently low.
<p>
The present eruption fissure is located between these two volcanic centres
with a direction parallel to the regional tectonic lineament. The
subglacial topography directs meltwater from the erupting fissure toward
the Grimsvoetn caldera which is rapidly filling. By the evening of Oct. 
1st the ice cover above the subglacial lake had risen 10-15 m."

<b>ICELAND REVIEW reported on 10 October 1996</B><br> 
<BR>
A newly formed 3.5 km long rift has been torn into the surface of the
Vatnaj&ouml;kull glacier. Scientists only discovered the gorge yesterday 
after the weather cleared to allow the first flights over the icecap in 
almost a week. The cleft lies just to the south of the main crater which 
was formed at the beginning of the month by a volcanic eruption forcing 
its way through 450 metres of glacial ice. Scientists estimate that 
the southern end of the newly formed ravine is 200 metres wide, but that 
the cleft is much wider at its northern end nearest the crater. The 
<a href="canyon.gif">eruption</a> continued unabated yesterday, belching 
enormous towers of black 
volcanic ash, smoke, steam and detritus high above the cracked surface of 
the glacier. At one stage yesterday there were massive explosions of ash 
from the crater at regular 10-15 minute intervals. Meanwhile the 
Gr&iacute;msv&ouml;tn subglacial basin, a huge depression under the 
icecap, continues to fill with meltwater. There has, as yet, been no sign 
of the large scale flooding of the surrounding countryside warned of by 
scientists.  
<hr>
<b>Magnus Halldorsson at the Science Institute, University of Iceland,  
reports [updated 28 Oct]:</b><br> 
<br>
<b>October 11-14</b><br>
The amplitude of the eruption tremor, thought to reflect the vigour of 
the eruption, decreased steadily. The tremor was last seen in the late
afternoon of October 13, indicating that the eruption had ceased. 
Observations from an aircraft on October 11  showed that the height 
of the eruption column had decreased markedly. On October 12 a little 
island was seen within a gigantic glacier canyon at the eruption site. 
No explosive activity has been seen after October 14.<br>
<br>
<b>October 16</b><br>
The jökulhlaup, i.e. draining of the eruption meltwater which has been
accumulating under the ice shelf on the Grímsvötn caldera lake, is
imminent. The water level in Grímsvötn is now at 1504 m according to a GPS
instrument which scientists from the Nordic Volcanological Institute
deployed on the ice shelf on October 11.  Although the eruption is over,
500-700 m3/s of meltwater is currently flowing into Grímsvötn. Normally 
jökulhlaups start when water is able to penetrate beneath the ice dam but
before the lake level has risen high enough to lift the ice dam, which is
at about 1505-1510 m elevation.  The lake level was at 1455 m a.s.l. when
the last jökulhlaup started in April 1996. The total volume of the lake was
1.5 km3  of which 1.1 km3 drained out during the jökulhlaup which 
increased gradually to a peak in 3 weeks.
<p>
Today  about 3 km3 of water are stored in the caldera lake Grímsvötn
and the discharge may increase more rapidly than in the normal jökulhlaups,
even reach a peak in 3 days (as in the jökulhlaup of 1938) because warm
water draining from the eruption site melts the ice walls of the
watercourse beneath the glacier and they expand rapidly.  
<p>
The highest crater along the 7-8 km long hyaloclastite ridge which
has now formed beneath the glacier is 250-300 m higher than the former
glacier bedrock, i.e. at about 1500 m a.s.l. The top of the crater  forms
an island within a meltwater lake in a 500 m wide ice canyon. The gorge  is
3-5 km long and sits within a 30 km2 depression within the glacier. The 
ice walls in the canyon are about 150 m high where they sit on the new
ridge. The glacier was about 450 m thick at this site prior to the
eruption.
<p>
This eruption is the forth largest in Iceland during this century and
is estimated to have produced 0.6-0.7 km3 of tephra or 0.4 km3  of solid
rock. Only the eruptions in Katla 1918, Hekla 1947, and  Surtsey are
larger. 
<p>
<b> October 17.</b><br>
The water level of Grímsvötn has now risen to 1505 m.
The inflow of water from eruption site during the last 4 days is estimated 
to be 400-500 m3/s. A few microearthquakes within the Grímsvötn region 
whereas the The Bárðarbunga region is quiet.

Snow covered for the first time the new mountain within the crater formed by the 
Vatnaj&ouml;kull eruption.<br> 
The <a href="cany2.jpg">canyon [image from Magnus Halldorsson]</a>
 is now estimated to measure around 400m wide and between 1-2km in 
length. At one point during its period of high activity the canyon was 
measured at around 3km in length.<b>From Iceland Review.</b> 
<p>
<b> October 21.</b><br>
The water level of Grímsvötn has now risen to 1507 m.
Microearthquake activity within the Grímsvötn region.
The Bárðarbunga region is quiet.
<p>
<b> October 25.</b><br>
The water level of Grímsvötn is now at 1509.5 m.
Inflow of water from eruption site is estimated at 200 m3/s.
Microearthquake activity in the Grímsvötn region has decreased.
The Bárðarbunga region is quiet.
<hr>
<b>October 30.</b><BR>
<br>
The eruption ended on October 13th, no eruptive activity has occurred since. 
Meltwater continious to flow from the eruptive site towards the subglacial 
Grimsvotn caldera lake, but at a much reduced rate than before.
For the last week the flow of water has been on the order of 100 cubic meters 
per second, sufficient to raise the water level of the lake by about 
0.25 meters per day. Rate of flow is decreasing with time, as the eruptive 
material becomes cooler.<br>
<BR>
<b>November 1.</b><BR>
<BR>
The water level of Grímsvötn is still at similar level as October 25. 
Microearthquake activity in the Grímsvötn region is still ongoing, whereas 
the Bárðarbunga region is quiet. <BR>
