<font size=+2>Gold in the late 1990's<p></font>

</center>

<blockquote>

<font size=+2><b>GOLD</B></FONT> has historically been regarded as a hedge against 
inflation as well as financial disaster.  Currently most of the major economies 
of the world are experiencing low controlled inflation and sound growing economies.  
Given this backdrop, gold would seemingly not be expected to perform well, certainly 
measured by its historic means.<p>

Indeed, Bullion has traded in a fairly boring trend of somewhat below $400 an ounce U.S. 
for most of the 1990's with a rare few shots above $400 lasting very briefly 
(the most recent being February 1996).<p>

Despite all of the above, the price of gold producer stocks have been doing very well in 
1996.  This begs the question -- why?<p>

The most widely accepted explanation comes from, of all things -- simple supply 
demand economics.  In the first three quarters of 1995 global gold demand grew 
by 15% compared with a flat supply.  Most of the increase in demand comes from 
Southeast Asia, notably India and China.  There are millions of people who for 
the first time now have some discretionary income and Asians generally like 
gold for jewelry and as safeguard against local currency.<p>

The lid has been kept on gold bullion despite almost 3 years of demand exceeding 
supply in part by large gold producers like Barrick Gold Corp using a technique 
called forward selling whereby they borrow the gold from a central bank, then sell 
it as a futures contract.  This approach can backfire if gold moves up and with a real fear 
this may happen there have been signs that forward selling is being used less and less.<p>

Dynamic has been on record for about 2 years now predicting Gold will hit $700 per ounce 
U.S. by the year 2000.  They are still holding to that prediction.<p>

There is another, for some more compelling reason, to have some gold in your portfolio.  
It is not correlated with other investment assets.  Stocks and bonds move in the 
same direction the majority of the time.  Gold, on the other hand, "beats to its 
own drummer".  So even though gold is a risky investment by itself, having a 
small portion (say 5%) in a portfolio will likely have the effect of smoothing 
out the overall volatility of your portfolio.<p>

If you wish to have gold as part of your portfolio, there are two major ways.  One is 
to buy direct bullion.  The other is to buy shares in gold companies.  If the 
gold story turns out to be as positive as some believe in the next few years, 
both of these approaches should provide favorable results.  However the latter 
approach should be the more favorable in terms of degree.  That's because a gold 
producer that spends $300 per ounce to produce gold trading at $400 is making a 
$100 out of the ground margin.  If gold moves to $500 per ounce the out of ground 
margin will double.  For most investors the second option will involve selecting 
a mutual fund that specifically invests in gold or gold companies.<p>

As a final note, Canada has a very high gold weighting so if the gold story unfolds 
favorably this will provide a favorable boost to our overall markets.<p>
