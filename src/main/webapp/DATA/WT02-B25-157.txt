<p><font color="#000000">The following case study was written by Elliot and Diane Steele in order to be shared with all affiliates 
nationwide. NAMI would like to extend our gratitude to the Steele's for their contribution, and to all the AMIs 
who sent examples of their great work to share. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&quot;End the Mystery&quot; Candlelight Vigil held in St. Petersburg, FL was coordinated by the Steele's and sponsored 
by Pinellas County AMI. The event was held in a public park and featured food, education, music, speakers, 
provider booths and ended with the candlelight vigil. The approximately 700 participants stayed from 4pm until 
sunset and attracted three evening news stories.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Keep in mind that this case study outlines a very elaborate event. Affiliates my wish to pick and choose from the 
recommended activities. Please do not feel as if it is imperative you include every aspect listed here. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">For more information about this event please read the following guide or contact: </font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#000000">PREFACE</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">As we work hard on the Candlelight Vigil, we must always think back on the worst times we and our loved ones 
have experienced, trying to work through the maze of the system and deal with the loss caused by this tragic 
illness. This will reinforce the fact that any sacrifice we make now is worth it. If we can educate people and end 
stigma, thereby opening doors for help, it will be a giant step on the road to equality. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If everyone of our 1100 affiliates can have a public educational event during National Mental Illness Awareness 
Week 1995, it will have a phenomenal impact on the media. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We all must stand up with our heads held high and be proud of our loved ones who are suffering this living hell. 
If we allow the stigma to shame us from speaking out proudly, we can never really accomplish our goal. Take 
advantage of every minute and utilize it as a &quot;moment of opportunity.&quot; </font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>PURPOSE &amp; GOAL </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The purpose of the event was to educate the general public about neurobiological diseases (mental illnesses) 
and to end stigma. This was accomplished by locating the event in a public place and by inviting and informing 
consumers and families as well as health care providers, friends, politicians, churches and all forms of media. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Remember - the best weapon against stigma is knowledge.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our goal is to have an Candlelight Vigil event in each of the 1100 affiliates in the United States during Mental 
Illness Awareness Week 1995, no matter how large or small it may be.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you feel you can only have a small candlelight vigil by a local church, that would be great, or if you could get 
10,000 people at an event in a large park, that would be even better. Whatever the case, do the best you can - 
most importantly is that you do something. This is our opportunity to show unity throughout the entire United 
States. </font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>PROCEDURE </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Organize Committee </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Contact the people in your local affiliate and start an Candlelight Vigil committee. The committee should contain 
about 8-10 people with various areas of interest. Each member of the main Candlelight Vigil committee will 
chair one or more of the subcommittees. By keeping the main committee at 8-10, you can maintain organization, 
communication and commitment by all members. Each chairperson of the subcommittees must have a strong 
interest in the committees he/she chairs and can influence others to join and contribute.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Pick A Date </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">National Mental Illness Awareness week was the ideal time for such an event. The Sunday Mental Illness 
Awareness week has been designated for Candlelight Vigils nationwide to kick off the event. Try to get the 
mayor of your local municipality to proclaim the week Mental Illness Awareness Week.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Pick A Location </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Any public place would be great. If you are located in a warm climate, a local park would be an excellent 
location for the event. If you are in a large community with a large homeless population, try to locate the event in 
a close proximity to the homeless since many may be suffering with mental illnesses. Keep in mind however that 
you also want to draw a cross section of the community to educate. If an outside event is not possible, a local 
community center, church or school may be an alternative site. Be sure that all agree on exactly what you are 
going to do. Once you set your limits stick to them. If you reached your goals adequately and have time to add 
another aspect to the event, then do it. But don't try to do more than is reasonable because you may jeopardize 
the entire event.</font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>SUB-COMMITTEES </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In the beginning have the sub-committee chairpersons meet every 3 weeks and probably weekly during the last 
one to two months to ensure excellent communication among the sub-committees. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">These are the sub-committees we used. You may have many more ideas of your own.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">Creative Arts </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This sub-committee is in charge of designing or arranging for posters, flyers, T-shirts, banners, etc. 
End the Mystery T-shirts can be ordered through AMI - Pinellas County. The flyers, posters and 
tickets can be printed at a local print shop.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We distributed flyers wherever possible. We gave them out at work, placed them in hospitals, 
mental health associations, social security and HRS offices, drop in centers and more. Be careful 
with flyers however - don't do anything that might offend someone, e.g., don't place flyers on cars in 
a parking lot which may encourage littering. This may actually be negative advertising. We had 
5000 flyers printed and distributed about 4800.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We placed posters in all the psychiatric hospitals, many psychiatrists' offices, grocery stores, malls, 
places of employment, Laundromats, other health care facilities and many more places. Use your 
imagination. The grocery stores required that the posters state that we are a non-profit organization. 
If possible, place posters around the event site a few days before the event. Try to find a contact for 
billboards.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Food </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is in charge of preparing the meal and distributing the food to all attendees. If you 
choose to serve food, you might want to think about charging admission.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Try to obtain food donations from various sources. Check with restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, 
hospitals and any other food providers you may think of. Spaghetti dinners are relatively easy and 
inexpensive to provide. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Be sure that your selection is not too cumbersome to carry and try to have everything self-contained. 
As people came through the food line, they received a covered meal platter with utensils and napkin 
inside.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">You may want to ask McDonalds. They frequently donate orange drink to events. You may ask Pepsi 
or Coke also for donations.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Children's Activities </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for keeping the children entertained. If the children are happy, their 
parents will stay longer and increase their education. Some suggested activities include story telling 
and reading, face painting, clowns, balloons (if allowed), coloring book and crayons, moon walk 
and paper mache'.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Welcome Committee </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The Welcome Committee is responsible for greeting guests when they arrive and for directing them 
to specific activities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We also had a raffle with our event. People could sign up (name and address) at the welcome 
committee to win a prize (we had 2 fruit baskets). This gave us a mailing list for future events. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Educational Material </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for having educational material available so the attendees can 
increase their knowledge and awareness about mental illnesses. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We had videos and pamphlets about the major mental illnesses, NAMI, the brain banks and much 
more. We gave away buttons saying &quot;End the Mystery, Ask me about NBD.&quot; We had a dozen health 
care providers in our area set up educational booths under a tent. They were expected to supply 
knowledge rather than solely promote their business. We stressed to providers that education was a 
&quot;win-win&quot; situation for all. We accomplished this by educating as many as possible as to the need 
for health insurance parity and early intervention along with long term care when needed. These 
types of changes will benefit both consumers and providers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Program Organization </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for preparing an agenda of speakers, music and entertainment and 
keeping the program flowing throughout the event. This committee needs to seek qualified 
interesting speakers and arrange a program that will flow well.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Keep the length of the event short enough to keep the people interested until sunset and the 
candlelight vigil. Our event ran from 4 PM until sunset. This 3 1/2 hour event was too long and 
required creativity to maintain their interest. Be prepared to fill in or adjust your agenda if it is 
moving along more rapidly than expected. There may be a fair number of speakers that may not 
show and one must also be prepared to adjust for speakers who must go on at a certain time to 
allow them to leave for another engagement.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We had a DJ, a folk singing group and about a dozen speakers at our event. Our speakers included a 
consumer, family member, psychiatrist, politician, health care provider and many more. We had a 
few wonderful surprises. A consumer spoke out for the first time that he had suffered with bipolar 
disorder for years and never told anyone. Another member of the audience spoke about her daughter 
with an illness that died 8 months before our event. These were our most inspirational speakers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Audio </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for getting the speaker system operating properly for the event. If you 
are in a church, this may be a relatively easy task since audio equipment may already be in place. 
However, it may require someone with knowledge of electronics to know what will be needed in a 
park. Check to see what electrical source is available in your location.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Religious Outreach </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for contacting all churches and synagogues in the area to ask them to 
promote our event in their bulletin and announce it during church services.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We gave each church and synagogue two complimentary tickets for them to give to one of their 
members. These tickets accompanied a letter explaining our event and educational material about 
mental illnesses for their church bulletin board. Try to have each AMI member take this information 
to their place of worship. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Media </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for obtaining media coverage before, during and after the event. This 
can be accomplished through the newspapers, radio and television. Try to contact United Press 
International. Look for any past media contacts and make contact with them again via a press release 
(example in package). Update press releases when closer to the event and follow with a telephone 
call during the final week prior to the event. Do not forget to stress to the media that this is a 
nationwide event with Candlelight Vigil in every state during Mental Illness Awareness Week. 
Contact any newspaper or television community calendar and try to get public service 
announcements on your local radio stations. REMEMBER TO SEND A THANK YOU NOTE FOR 
ANY COVERAGE RECEIVED. THIS MAY INSURE EQUAL OR BETTER COVERAGE NEXT 
YEAR.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We sent out a news release to about 100 different media sources (all radio and television stations, 
newspapers including the small community papers). We sent a second updated press release a few 
weeks later. We found that a follow up telephone call was essential to get the coverage.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We had our event aired on three of the four major television networks on the evening and next 
morning news. We had from 30 seconds to 2 1/2 minutes air time on End the Mystery. We had 
previous contact with the NBC affiliate in our area WFLA, Channel 8. They devoted a few hours of 
a reporter and cameraman's time filming the set up through the candlelight vigil. Our event was 
announced as one of the lead in stories for the evening news.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We maintained a list of all our media contacts and sent them a thank you as well as a thank you to 
their boss. In return we received a personal phone call from one of the reporters to thank us for our 
note and we received a letter from another reporter to thank us for the thank you. We now have a 
great working relationship with these people.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Physical Set Up </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for physically setting up the room, hall or park where the event is 
taking place. This may include setting up tables, chairs, audio system, banners, stage, porta potties, 
tents and whatever else is needed for your particular setting. Make arrangements for trash pick up 
throughout the event. You may want to hire someone for this purpose.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you are having an inside event and you are expected to clean up after yourself, it would be wise to 
draw a map of the location of items before you begin moving them around. This will aid in putting 
things back as you found them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Clean Up </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for getting everything back to normal after the event. Some facilities 
may require you to pay for cleaning after the event. Others may expect you to clean it yourself. It is 
extremely important that it gets cleaned well to insure you the opportunity of using the facility in the 
future. Again, be sure you know where all items are located before you start to set up for your event 
so everything will be returned to their proper place. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Sponsorship </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for getting any donations of money, food, services or equipment. The 
first step is to brainstorm your group for any influential/wealthy individual or business which may 
have a family member or close friend who suffers with a neurobiological disease. Get creative and 
don't be afraid to use your resources. One of our members is a Director of Food and Nutritional 
Services at a local hospital. He contacted his vendors, his employees and his hospital and received 
the food, servers, beverages and disposables as a donation. He also received mailing lists/labels 
for media press releases and mental health agencies and clergy from the hospital community 
relations/marketing department and social services department. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">A local tent company erected a 40' x 80' tent (for the cost of their labor) to house mental health 
providers to set up educational displays. We did not charge the first year. However, we will now 
ask a donation or even co-sponsorship because they see our efforts at educating the community as a 
win/win situation for all. Also the fact that we have spearheaded an insurance parity bill with one 
of our State Representatives which when passed will have a trickle down effect to all mental health 
care providers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The way to get in to a large health care provider's facility is to find out the name of the director of 
community relations/marketing department. Present them with a press release telling them how many 
people you expect at the event and that it is going to happen nation-wide. They may want to do 
depression screening, etc. at the event. If you can find cooperative people you may even be able to 
get media mailing labels from them and they may send out their own press releases.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We are on the list for the City of St. Petersburg, FL for co-sponsorship. That will give us added 
funds for our event, as well as increased credibility. Many social organizations such as Rotary, 
Kiwanis, Chambers of Commerce, Women's Club, sororities and fraternities can be contacted for 
potential co-sponsorship.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">One of our members sits on the board of the Tampa Marine Institute - an organization which helps 
rehabilitate youth offenders. They have offered their services for set up/clean up of the park as a 
way of paying back to the community some of the good they have received. We can never be afraid 
to ask. Many times when you least expect it, you may run into someone who knows the 
discrimination people suffering with NBD experience, and want to help.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>CANDLELIGHT VIGIL</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our candles are lit for 3 purposes: </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">1) To shed light on dark corners to dispel the stigma </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">2) To bring hope for the future </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">3) In memory of those no longer with us </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">We distributed over 400 glass votive candles rather than candle sticks. We felt this was safer since the wax was 
less likely to spill on anyone. There were 2 drawbacks however. </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">1) The candles could not be lit by another candle. We used 6 butane candles to light all of them. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">2) The candles would go out easily if tilted a lot due to the building up of melted wax. These 
candles cost about $.60 each.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">If the facility or park where the event is being held requires liability insurance, please don't let that scare you 
from holding the event. One can usually purchase a one million dollar liability policy for a one day event for a 
few hundred dollars.</font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>POST EVENT MEETING</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The purpose of this meeting is to have fun and congratulate each other on a job well done. Also, this is the best 
time to critique the event. The problem spots are much more obvious now than they will be at any later date. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Have this meeting as soon after the event as possible. You may want to have the date solidified before the event 
actually takes place, e.g., the Friday following the event.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This meeting is a good time to re-assign committees so everyone can start organizing their thoughts right away. 
It's never too soon to start planning for next year. </font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>SUMMARY</strong> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our first year we spent $1,666.00 with donated revenues of $1,820.00. This gave us a small profit. However, 
the knowledge, thinking and inspiration we stimulated through our event was priceless. Much of our event was 
donated or our expenses would have been higher. As we get sponsorship as well as increased donations and 
ticket sales, our budget will allow us the opportunity to be more effective. Use your imagination and I am sure 
you will think of bigger and better ideas to share with your sister alliances.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you are small, don't feel intimidated by some of the larger groups. If getting media or sponsorship seems 
overwhelming for your group, don't let that concern you at this time. Work in your own comfort area now, then 
branch out next year to add another aspect to your event. Whatever you do will be a great achievement for the 
whole picture. We need EVERYONE'S support.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This is a step in a nationwide campaign of unity to end the stigma. Let's all make it a big success. REMEMBER 
THE BEST WEAPON AGAINST STIGMA IS KNOWLEDGE. </font></p>
