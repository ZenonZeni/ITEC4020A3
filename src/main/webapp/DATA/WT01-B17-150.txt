<a name="chro"><b>CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME</b></a><p> 
By the time he came to acupuncturist M. M. van Benschoten, O.M.D., practicing in Reseda, California, Albert, aged 37, had been beset by chronic fatigue syndrome for 7 years. He reported headaches, chest pain, fatigue, lymph node swelling, muscle aches, irritability, and lightheadness. Although Albert had elevated blood levels of Epstein-Barr virus, normally associated with chronic fatigue, Dr. van Benschoten’s analysis of Albert’s acupuncture meridians (energy pathways through the body) showed no indication of bacterial or viral activity capable of producing his symptoms. <p>
Instead, he found mercury toxicity from dental amalgams to be the fundamental underlying cause of the suppression of Albert’s immune system.<p>
To arrive at this conclusion, Dr. van Benschoten used an energy medicine device in an analytical approach called “acupoint biophoton diagnostics.” Toxic metals such as mercury interfere with the normal energy patterns in various acupuncture  channels; harmful energies set up interference patterns (“biophoton” emissions) in the meridians, in this case, the heart channel, explains Dr. van Benschoten. <p>
He prescribed a series of Chinese herbs, including chrysanthemum, angelica dahurica, isatis, bupleurum, cnidium, astragalus, salvia, platycodon, siler, taraxacum, ligustrum lucidum, and fructus lycium. After taking these herbs for 6 weeks, Albert was headache-free and had relief from fatigue and chest pain. The degree to which mercury toxicity was interfering with his energy pathways also was reduced. Three months later, Albert had 14 mercury amalgams removed. <p>
However, on his next visit, Dr. van Benschoten found that the mercury interference had increased. “Over-zealous removal of all amalgam fillings can significantly increase the patient’s mercury levels  if done without adequate precautions during amalgam removal and proper mercury detoxification therapy,” notes Dr. van Benschoten. He instructs his patients to wear an oxygen mask during amalgam removal, in addition to having their dentists use a rubber dam and high speed suction with water.<p>
But Dr. van Benschoten says that Chinese herbal medicines successfully help detoxify the patient and restore immune function  after mercury amalgam removal. He prescribed a second series of herbs, including moutan, taraxacum, prunella, glycyrrhiza, grifola, ligustrum lucidum, and verbena to clear the mercury from Albert’s system. After taking them for several months, Albert reported he was still free from chronic fatigue and that he had a stronger resistance to infection.<p>

<a name="cons"><b>CONSTIPATION</b></a><p>
When Robert’s mother brought him to homeopath Sujata Owens, RS Hom., he had suffered from severe constipation since birth. In fact, during his first 4 months of life, Robert had almost no bowel movements. When he saw Dr. Owens for the first time, Robert, age 7, had a condition conventional medicine called congenital megacolon or Hirschsprung’s disease. A portion of his large intestine lacked the nerve endings necessary to produce peristalsis, or muscular movements leading towards evacuation.<p>
Robert’s symptoms included bloating, vomiting, sharp, twisting, cramping pains in his abdomen, and frequent, painful urination. On the average, he moved his bowels only once a week and only after great effort. He was always exhausted; he looked sad, rarely smiled, and had little interest in anything; he had difficulty learning, was underweight, sucked his thumb constantly, wet his bed at night, had poor appetite, and was nervous. “He is a quiet, shy boy with very low energy,” says Dr. Owens. He had undergone numerous conventional medical tests and procedures, including ultrasound, surgery, and antibiotics, and frequent short-term hospitalization for pain attacks, but benefited very little from any of it, Robert’s mother reported.<p>
Dr. Owens prescribed a single medium-potency dose of Plumbum Metallicum 200c, which is homeopathic lead. Two weeks later in a follow-up consultation, Dr. Owens judged the results to be “excellent, with 80% improvement.” Robert was a changed boy: he was talkative, energetic, mentally alert, enjoying 1-3 bowel movements every day; he was free of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bedwetting; his appetite was good and he urinated without any pain. <p>
Dr. Owens gave Robert no further remedies at all, and saw him again in 6 months. She admitted that even she was “amazed” at the changes in personality and physical health she observed. Robert had gained weight and grown taller; his bowel movements continued to be regular; his interest in life was vigorous, and he appeared mature and confident, said Dr. Owens.<p>

<a name="depr"><b>DEPRESSION</b></a><p>
Bill, aged 47, had suffered from depression for 12 years. He had no energy, his memory was failing, he could barely work, his feet were often numb, and he sometimes had to shuffle when he wanted to walk. Bill was on Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride, an oral antidepressant) and a strong anti-insomnia medication, but all his symptoms persisted, for which his conventional doctors had no medical explanation. It wasn't until consulting with nutritionist Phyllis Bronson and physician Harold Whitcomb, M.D., at the Aspen Clinic for Preventive and Environ-mental Medicine in Colorado, that Bill learned the source of his condition. <p>
Bronson and Whit-comb did a hair analysis on Bill and found that his system had a dangerously high level of mercury. Depression originating in heavy metal toxicity is fairly common, says Bronson. Bill’s family, including his father, mother, and siblings, had similarly high levels of heavy metals and also suffered from depression. <p>
Electro-dermal screening revealed that mercury from his dental fillings was not the cause; rather, it was probably contaminated fish, as Bill’s family grew up near the sea and consumed a lot of shellfish. Bill was also deficient in magnesium, zinc, and certain key brain chemicals such as acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, and histadine. <p>
His physician took Bill off his sleeping pills, then Whitcomb and Bronson started him on a course of oral chelation to remove the heavy metals from his body. They used a multinutrient supplement called OC 2 Pack, taken at the rate of 2 packs a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 6 months.  The purpose of OC 2 Pack (which contains 30 nutrients including antioxidants, soluble fiber, fatty acids, garlic, alfalfa, and parsley) is to provide essential dietary factors to promote the health of the heart and lungs as well as metabolism of fats and cholesterol.<p>
They further prescribed Osatate (a calcium source from bone) and Vasotate (magnesium L-aspartate), both of which would facilitate fuller absorption of each mineral. Bill took Sedaphan Plus, which includes amino acids (taurine, glycine, glutamine), vitamins (B2, B6, B3), herbs (valerian, passiflora, chamomile), and glandulars (brain, pituitary) to help restore his depleted nervous system. <p>
Whitcomb and Bronson gave Bill Chromease (which combines chromium with zinc, manganese, magnesium, vitamin B1, and whole pancreas glandular extract) to subdue his acute sugar cravings (200 mg twice a day); vitamin B12 (1500 mg 3 times a week) to help his anemia; and Zinotate (containing zinc picolinate) to facilitate the smooth functioning of about 70 enzymatic reactions throughout the body. <p>
Within 4 months, there was marked improvement in Bill’s depression. For the first time in years, he had enough energy to work and to be an active father. With his physician’s permission, he reduced his Zoloft from once every day to taking it occasionally, as needed, with ever longer gaps in between, provided he maintained his supplement intake. “That was 3 years ago and he’s still doing fine,” says Bronson. <p>

<a name="emph"><b>EMPHYSEMA</b></a><p>
After smoking cigarettes for 20 years, Betty, 57, was diagnosed with emphysema, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. That made her finally quit smoking. She had seen 5 doctors but none had helped her condition, which was worsening. By the time Betty arrived at the offices of Robert C. Atkins, M.D., in New York City, she was out of breath most of the time, especially upon exertion; she had no energy for work, could not walk up or down steps, suffered from migraine headaches, and had numbness in her fingers and feet. Her conventional doctors gave her a bronchodilator spray and told her she would have to live with this disabling condition.<p>
Dr. Atkins prescribed a low carbohydrate, low fat diet (to improve exercise tolerance and reduce breathlessness) and started her on a special nutrient program. The supplements, taken daily, included:  magnesium (elemental, 300-500 mg); omega-3 fatty acids (6-12 g); glutathione (400-600 mg); vitamin C (3 g); vitamin E (mixed tocopherols, 400 IU); beta carotene (50,000 IU); N-acetyl-cysteine (1000-2000 mg); selenium (200-300 mcg); pantethine (500-750 mg); licorice root (glycyrrhizin, 300-600 mg); and Gingko biloba (40 mg).<p>
Within a week on this program, Betty’s breathing capacity and energy level improved, and after 3 months, she described her progress as “terrific.” She was able to climb stairs and perform physical chores more easily. The headaches disappeared and she only rarely had to use her bronchodilator spray. “She’s very happy with her current condition and I expect her to improve,” says Dr. Atkins.<p>

<a name="hay"><b>HAY FEVER</b></a><p>
German physicians W. Frase, M.D., and Michael Weiser, Dr.rer.nat, conducted a study involving 126 doctors and 1090 hay fever patients. The patients were predominantly aged 21-24 and about 58% were allergic to grass, herb, and tree pollen. The patients took Luffa compositum Heel nasal spray 3-5 times daily and Luffa compositum Heel tablets 3 times daily. Both contain 4 homeopathic remedies.<p>
They continued this program for 2-6 weeks after which 72% reported either “very good” or “good” results; the patients’ tolerance for the remedies was also rated “very good.” Only 10% found the therapy unsuccessful. In a second study by Karl Heinz Ricken, M.D., involving 50 hay fever patients (with allergies to blooming plants or grasses), 34 patients finished the  treatment with both remedies (lasting 2-6 weeks) completely free of symptoms; 13 patients had a distinct improvement, and 3 patients had a slight benefit. In this study, 68% rated the results as “very good” and 26% as “good.”<p>

<a name="high"><b>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</b></a><p>
When John, aged 62, first came to Eric Braverman, M.D., director of the Princeton Associates for Total Health, he had suffered from high blood pressure for 10 years. His levels for cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), which are key indicators of heart health, were highly imbalanced and he was taking strong daily doses of 3 conventional medications. When John began Dr. Braverman’s program, his blood pressure was 140/90.<p>
First, Dr. Braverman put John on a low carbohydrate, high protein diet to help him lose weight. Next, he started John on daily supplementation with evening primrose and fish oil, a niacin-garlic formula,  safflower oil, and a hypertension nutrient formula. This consisted of garlic powder (200 mg), the amino acid taurine (200 mg), magnesium (oxide, 50 mg), potassium (chloride, 6.7 mg), selenium (sodium selenite, 20 mcg), zinc (chelate, 4 mg), chromium (chloride, 26.7 mcg), niacinamide (50 mg), vitamin C (40 mg), molybdenum (40 mg), vitamin B6 (50 mg), and beta carotene (1222.33 IU). John took 6 pills daily of this formula. <p>
Dr. Braverman used a hypertension formula he specially developed for his blood-pressure-lowering program, as well as a magnesium formula, containing vitamin B6 (65 mg), magnesium (oxide, 470 mg), and zinc (chelate, 15 mg).<p>
Two weeks into the program, John’s cholesterol had dropped from 264 to 131, his triglycerides had decreased from 161 to 100, his blood pressure was 120/80, and his HDL increased positively from 59 to 64. John was able to stop taking his conventional medications. After another week on the nutrients, his blood pressure was a healthier 110/80. <p>
Over the following months, Dr. Braverman reduced John’s nutrient program and adjusted his diet. John continued to be drug-free, his energy level and sexual drive had increased, and he was “doing fantastically well,” reports Dr. Braverman.<p>

<a name="inso"><b>INSOMNIA</b></a><p>
Ellen, aged 39, had endured intermittent insomnia for 3 years, accompanied by indigestion and temporomandibular joint dysfunction when she came to the medical offices of Denise McKee, M.D., at the University of Nevada School of Medicine in Reno. Ellen preferred a treatment approach that did not use drugs, so Dr. McKee prescribed cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES), a safe, nonaddictive use of microelectric impulses. <p>
CES stimulates the production of endorphins (pleasure-inducing molecules) in the brain by delivering 100 pulses per second of alternating current electricity from a cigarette-pack size model (weighing 8 ounces) with ear-clip electrodes that apply the current across the patient’s brain stem. CES is commonly used for treatment of insomnia, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, gastritis, substance abuse, migraines, and other conditions, reports Dr. McKee.<p>
She instructed Ellen to use the CES unit for 40 minutes each night before attempting to sleep. During the first 2 weeks, Ellen’s dreams became quite vivid and colorful, then after another 2 weeks, Ellen reported she was able to sleep through the night. In addition, her indigestion and jaw problems showed improvement. “CES is a forgotten, safe therapeutic modality that should be brought to the primary care physician’s awareness as an adjunctive treatment,” says Dr. McKee.<p>

<a name="migr"><b>MIGRAINES</b></a><p>
Cheryl, aged 39, had suffered from chronic severe migraine headaches during the 3 weeks before menstruation ever since her periods started at age 11. For some time, she had been using birth control pills to regulate her period and Imitrex (a conventional drug) to subdue her migraines. However, this drug left her constantly fatigued and did not quell all the migraine symptoms, Cheryl told Ellen W. Cutler, D.C., chiropractor, nutritionist, and director of the Tamalpais Pain Clinic in Corte Madera, California. Cheryl’s skin color was poor and looked devitalized, Dr. Cutler noted.<p>
Dr. Cutler used muscle response testing (also called applied kinesiology) and a 24-hour urine analysis to test Cheryl for imbalances in her digestion and nutrient assimilation as well as for shortages in key enzymes. When she discovered that Cheryl’s system was intolerant to sugars, Dr. Cutler prescribed an enzyme mixture to rebalance this. In addition, the muscle response testing revealed that Cheryl was allergic to a long list of foods, including salt, vinegar, ascorbic acid, lactose, and certain fruits. She was also allergic to alcohol, the hormones progesterone and adrenalin, thyroid extract, and radiation. <p>
Using an innovative approach called the Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique (N.A.E.T.), Dr. Cutler desensitized Cheryl’s nervous system so that it would not stage an allergic reaction to these substances, which had been producing her migraines. It took about 3 months, after which Cheryl had complete relief from her symptoms.<p>
Dr. Cutler also put Cheryl on a Systemic Formula called Ga  Adrenal containing adrenal and spleen glandular factors, Echinacea, selenium, zinc, inositol, vitamin C and vitamin B complex, to be taken at the dosage of 2-6 pills in the morning. She had Cheryl apply a progesterone cream to her temples and the back of her head, knowing that her allergy to progesterone actually indicated a deficiency of it in her system. In addition, Cheryl took both vitamin C (3000 mg daily) and evening primrose oil, on the days between ovulation and the start of her period.<p>
Once taking these, Cheryl had no further migraines and was able to discontinue the Imitrex. “The last time Cheryl came to see us, she wore bright colors and looked vibrant and happy,” says Dr. Cutler. “For the first time in years, she didn’t have a PMS headache.”<p>

<a name="ulce"><b>ULCERS</b></a><p>
Thomas, aged 40, suffered from stomach ulcer. When he came to Steven Margolis, M.D., director of Complete Family Care in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Thomas was a stressed-out executive who was dependent on conventional medications such as Tums, Rolaids, Pepsid AC, and Tagamet for temporary relief. Dr. Margolis put Thomas on an herbal preparation called de-glycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) at a dosage level of 1 tablet (380 mg) 20 minutes before each meal. Dr. Margolis took Thomas off all his other medications.<p>
Thomas reported some relief within 48 hours and considerable relief from his ulcer pain within 2 weeks. Thomas remained on the licorice preparation for 6 weeks, sufficient to enable the stomach lining to heal. Dr. Margolis also prescribed aloe vera juice (4 ounces daily), taken before meals with the DGL, to help the stomach lining heal and become more resistant to its own acids. <p>
Other supplements Dr. Margolis often uses with DGL are fresh cabbage juice or olive oil (1 teaspoon before meals). In a recent clinical study involving 874 ulcer patients, 77% were healed with DGL versus 65% with Tagamet, reports Dr. Margolis. In his practice, the success rate is roughly 80-85%, and at far less cost. Typically, a one month’s supply of DGL costs about $15 retail compared to up to $100 a month for conventional drugs. q<p>
