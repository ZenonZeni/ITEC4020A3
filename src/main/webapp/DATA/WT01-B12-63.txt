 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA </H2>

<P>  Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA is specifically formulated to nutritionally support the pancreas in a unique way. PANCREAS FORMULA contains herbs, enzymes, vitamins, minerals and concentrated tissue nutrients for their synergistic nutritional effect in support of proper pancreas function.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE PANCREAS & DIGESTION</H2>
<P>  The pancreas is one of the most important organs in our bodies. We can't live without it. It performs many functions that are important and are interrelated with the activities of many other organs of the endocrine system. In general, the pancreas has two major functions (1) enzyme production for digestion, and (2) insulin production  for  the  regulation  of  carbohydrate metabolism.</P>
<P>  In order to digest the food we eat, the pancreas produces  numerous  enzymes. They  include various  proteolytic  enzymes  such  as  trypsin, chymotrypsin and others that break down proteins. It also secretes lipases, which break down fats and amylases which break down complex carbohydrates in the form of starches and other large carbohydrate molecules.</P>
<P>  It used  to be thought that all of these  digestive enzymes were used up or excreted. We know now that many of them are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, where they are carried throughout the body for other purposes, such as the digestion of blood clots and foreign fats and proteins in the blood. For instance, trypsin and chymotrypsin keep the proteolytic activity in the blood to a healthy level and maintain a proper balance in the breaking down of fibrin in blood clots and other areas in the circulatory system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE PANCREAS & INSULIN</H2>
 <P>  The special cells in the pancreas, called the Islets of Langerhans, produce insulin and secrete it into the blood stream. Insulin is the primary regulator of carbohydrate metabolism in the body.   When we eat simple carbohydrates (sugars) they are absorbed directly into the blood stream relatively quickly. When we eat complex carbohydrates (starches and others), it is digested (broken down) into its component smaller units and eventually into glucose which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. The pancreas senses the level of glucose in the blood and produces insulin accordingly. Insulin then helps the glucose enter the cells, where it is used for energy production. If too much insulin is produced, not enough glucose remains in the blood and if too little is produced, too much glucose remains in the blood and not enough enters the cells.</P>
<P>   If the pancreas is overworked and does not receive the nutrients it needs to maintain its own healthy metabolic processes, it can become exhausted and not produce enough insulin. The result can be diabetes. If, on the other hand, too much insulin is produced, the blood sugar level will be too low. This condition is called hypoglycemia.  Therefore, maintaining the proper balance is important.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT PANCREAS FORMULA DOES</H2>
<P>  PANCREAS FORMULA provides nutrients that the pancreas needs to function properly. It contains Zinc, which is needed in the manufacture of insulin and copper to help maintain proper zinc levels. It contains Chromium, which is essential to the action of insulin at the cell level. Since the pancreas is made of epithelial tissue, it needs vitamin A to remain healthy. Because the (duodenum) and liver work so closely with the pancreas, concentrated tissue nutrients from them and from bovine pancreas are included as well. In addition, two highly active enzyme concentrates from pancreas, pancreatin and (pancrelipase) are important ingredients in Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA.  They supplement with enzymes which makes it possible for the pancreas gland to rest from the demand placed on it.</P>
 <P> The three valuable synergistic herbs, Dandelion, Goldenseal and Chickweed are also included for their synergistic effects.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Life Plus PANCREAS FORMULA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PANCREAS FORMULA </H2>
<P>Take one or two tablets three times per day. It is a good idea for those with sugar metabolism difficulties to take before or between meals as nutritional support for the pancreas.   It can be taken at mealtime for the digestive  value  of the  enzymes  in  PANCREAS FORMULA. The Life Plus products <A HREF="msoma.htm">SOMAZYME</A>,<A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT  TABS</A>  and  <A HREF= "mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A> are great synergistic products to take with PANCREAS FORMULA.</P>
