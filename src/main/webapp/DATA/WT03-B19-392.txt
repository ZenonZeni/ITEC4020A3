<H1>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions<BR>
from the energy sector</H1>
<HR>
<B>As the major source of man-made <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gases (GHGs)</A>, the energy sector offers 
the greatest opportunities for emissions reductions.</B>  About three quarters of human 
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - the most important man-made GHG - are caused by <A 
HREF = "fs025.html">the use of fossil fuels</A>, including oil, coal, and 
natural gas.  Fossil fuels also account for a significant part of man-made releases of methane, nitrous 
oxide, and several GHG "precursors" (gases that indirectly encourage the formation, or discourage 
the destruction, of GHGs), notably carbon monoxide, other oxides of nitrogen, and hydrocarbons.  
<P>
<B>New technologies that improve the efficiency of fuel-using equipment can significantly 
reduce GHG emissions.</B>  While pollution control devices can be used to reduce emissions of 
GHGs and their precursors (but not CO2), those currently available typically have several drawbacks.  
Not only are they costly and effective for only a limited range of machines and gases, but they tend to 
reduce overall energy efficiency.  Catalytic converters for automobiles, for example, reduce carbon 
monoxide emissions but, by reducing energy efficiency, can effectively increase automotive emissions 
of carbon dioxide.  A better  approach may be to develop technologies that improve the efficiency of 
fuel use.  If the same amount of fuel can be converted into more useful energy, less fossil fuel must be 
burned to achieve the same productivity.  Examples would include power plants that produce more 
electricity per tonne of coal, cars that travel further on a litre of petrol, and light bulbs that produce 
more light per watt.  And unlike pollution control devices, which generally target a particular gas, 
higher fuel efficiency has the additional advantage of simultaneously reducing <I>all</I> unwanted 
emissions, including GHGs.  It must be remembered, however, that by lowering costs, efficiency 
improvements may encourage people to make greater use of cars and other products, so that at least 
a portion of the energy savings would be offset by increased demand.<P>
<B>Improved technologies for <A HREF = "fs027.html">extracting, 
processing, and distributing fuels</A> can also lead to large reductions. </B> While fossil fuels 
release most of their GHGs when they are burned, they start emitting gases as soon as they are 
unearthed.  Improved maintenance of gas pipelines and of oil and gas wells can reduce leaks of 
methane from natural gas.  Methane emissions from coal mining can be cut if wells are drilled into the 
coal-bearing rock to tap and capture methane trapped in the rock before it escapes during mining.  At 
remote oil wells, natural gas that is now vented into the atmosphere or burned off, releasing methane 
and carbon dioxide respectively, can be captured and used as fuel or converted into fertilizer or other 
easily transported products.<P>
<B>Fossil fuels can often be replaced with renewable energy sources that produce less or even 
zero GHG emissions.</B>  New technologies are being developed that produce heat, electricity, or 
motion using non-fossil fuels.  Some of these energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells or 
wind-generated electricity, produce essentially no GHG emissions.  Others, notably biomass or 
biomass-derived fuels such as ethanol (used as a motor fuel), produce some GHG emissions as a 
result of incomplete combustion, fuel impurities, or chemical reactions during burning, but much less 
than do fossil fuels.  While these non-fossil fuel sources are much cleaner than fossil fuels, however, 
each one also has its own drawbacks.  Some, such as photovoltaic panels, are still not economically 
competitive for most applications.  As for hydro-power, it requires dams that flood the land and 
dislocate people; wind and solar power require areas with high winds or regular sunshine; and 
fuel-wood depends on the availability of (sustainably-managed) forest-land.<P>
<B>In industrialized countries changes in lifestyle could lower energy use and thus GHG emis- 
sions . . .</B> Increased energy consciousness would encourage people to adopt any number of 
minor changes in their habits, such as car-pooling or riding public transport instead of driving alone to 
work, reducing average lighting levels in stores and offices, taking care not to leave lights or 
televisions on when not in use, reducing unnecessary driving, and re-using materials to reduce the 
need for manufacturing.  Lifestyle changes could also be major, such as adopting a less materialist 
lifestyle, restructuring communities to place people closer to offices and shops, redesigning dwellings 
and schedules to take maximum advantage of sunlight and solar heating, and making use of dispersed, 
renewable energy sources such as wood stoves and wind pumps.  It is difficult to tell how acceptable 
and practical such lifestyle changes will be in the absence of compelling economic incentives.<P>
<B>although such opportunities will prove rarer in much of the developing world.</B>  In 
countries pursuing development policies geared to reducing poverty, energy use will probably need to 
rise to support basic services such as electric lighting, refrigeration, and so on.  Technologies that 
would enable developing countries to grow economically while reducing or stabilizing energy use are 
currently of limited availability.  What’s more, even when such technologies are economically 
competitive over the long-term, they tend to require more up-front capital than developing countries 
can afford, unless they receive support from aid agencies or other international sources.<P>
