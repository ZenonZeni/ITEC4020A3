Mass market sales of medicinal herbs in U.S. drugstores and supermarkets grew by 35% in
1994, worth $106.7 million in sales. Topping the list were garlic, whose drugstore sales

Their sales in food stores were even higher: garlic sales in retail food outlets grew by 40%

acidophilus (taken as a beneficial intestinal bacteria) whose drugstore sales soared by 140%

<P>Worldwide sales of herbal medicines (called phytomedicines outside the U.S.) are equally
booming, estimated at $12.4 billion for Europe, Japan, Asia, and North America. In Europe,
sales of herbal medicines are allocated according to these categories: cardiovascular,
27.2%; digestive, 14.4%; respiratory, 15.3%, tonics, 14.4%; sedative, 9.3%; and others. In
Germany, for example, one-third of all nonprescription drugs are herbal and <I>Gingko biloba</I>
(as a circulatory agent) leads the pack with annual sales of $280 million, followed by horse
chestnut (for the blood) with $103 million. Herbal sales worldwide are expect-ed to continue
growing by 8-15% during the next 5 years, depending on the region.

In Germany, more than 80% of physicians use herbal medicines, medical students are
taught herbs in college, and there is no strong antagonism between conventional and
alternative medicines. In the U.S., medical school education ignores herbs and
conventional doctors hardly ever use them. FDA regulations and state medical
licensing laws further obstruct their practice. Help change all this by supporting

<CENTER><H2>ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CAN SAVE BILLIONS</H2></CENTER>
<UL><LI>Let's Try It
If, as a taxpayer, you're wondering if there isn't some way to reduce the $1
trillion-plus annual price tag for American health care, here are some startling figures on
how cost-effective alternative medicine could be if we gave it a <I>free run</I> in the medical
marketplace.
<LI>ASTHMA.  The cost of medications, doctors' visits, and hospitalizations for asthma is
about $10 billion a year, but with alternative medicine, using allergy elimination diets
plus nutritional supplements, the savings would be about $3 billion.
<LI>ATHEROSCLEROSIS. Conventional medicine offers various kinds of surgery and drugs,
costing $30 billion annually. Alternative approaches, including nutrition and chelation
therapy, would save taxpayers about $9 billion.
<LI>CHRONIC EAR INFECTIONS. The combined cost of office visits, antibiotics, and ear tubes
for about 100,000 children is $650 million. Using allergy elimination diets, estimated
savings would be $487.5 million with a 75% reduction in the recurrence of ear infections.
<LI>HEART ATTACK. Conventional treatment includes administering clot-dispersing drugs that
cost between $500 million to $1 billion a year, or about $2600 a dose. The recommended
alternative therapy involves a $5 dose of intravenous magnesium, producing cost savings of
close to $1 billion.
<LI>OSTEOARTHRITIS. The annual cost for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is about $2-4
billion. Alternative therapies, involving nutrition and dietary modification, would shave
about $1 billion off this cost.
<LI>PEPTIC ULCER. Conventional treatments cost $2 billion a year, while alternative
therapies produce healing at one-third the cost, saving $1.33 billion.
<LI>PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT. Conven-tional therapy, involving surgery ($5000/operation) and
Proscar ($540/year) costs $2 billion a year to treat 2 million men. Alternative therapy
costs about $150 a person, saving $2.78 billion annually.

UNSAFE WATER MANDATED BY U.S. CONGRESS</H2></CENTER>

An estimated 20% of Americans (53 million people) unknowingly drink contaminated water
polluted with lead, radiation, feces, or other poisons, according to Environmental
Protection Agency data collected in 1993-94. That number was 7.6 million higher than 1992.
At least 1000 deaths each year and about 400,000 cases of waterborne illness can be blamed
on contaminated tap water, stated the Environmental Working Group (EWG). 
<P>They further reported that herbicides were found in the drinking water of almost all 29
Midwestern cities and towns tested for their study. In one Illinois city the level of the
weedkiller cyanazine in public water was 34 times above the federal standard. The EWG
estimated that 20-25 million Americans are now drinking herbicide-polluted water. Laboratory
studies have proven that animals fed herbicides in their feed have higher rates of cancer
and birth defects. Experts for the EWG noted that polluted drinking water could pose serious
health problems for infants and children.

<CENTER><H2>ANTIBIOTICS: The High Price of Excess</H2></CENTER>

When it comes to supposed medical "realities," when its trusted drugs fail to work,
conventional medicine acts as if it's standing on the edge of the world, facing the dark
chasm of disease, powerless and without any treatments. 
<P>New studies from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicate that there is a sharp
rise in drug-resistant bacteria. Bacteria are mutating and no longer are susceptible to
standard antibiotics, including penicillin. Each year an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 U.S.
patients die from infections acquired in hospitals and more than 50% of these deaths are
attributed to antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. These infections cost U.S. patients
more than $1.2 billion a year in extra hospital costs.
<P>The point here is that the world is not flat, as the conventional doctors believe, but
round. There are treatments beyond the seeming chasm of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
First, CDC researchers admitted that the shocking rise of drug-resistant bacteria is due to
"excessive and inappropriate" use of antibiotics. So use <I>fewer</I> antibiotics. 
<P>Second, there are many natural "antibiotics" and anti-infection agents in alternative
medicine, including colloidal silver, hydrogen peroxide, and numerous herbs, to which the
bacterial world is not resistant. By using less antibiotics and more alternative medicines,
we can save money, produce fewer toxic side effects, restore the bacterial world to balance,
and help patients heal faster.

unfair FDA labeling rules for nutritional supplements. 
<P>
In a letter to Kessler, Dr. Whitaker declared: "I will publicly violate FDA

supplements with truthful, nonmisleading labels and claims that have not been
approved by the FDA, and I have no intention of seeking such approval."

Though clearly against FDA regulations, this activity cannot be illegal, Dr.
Whitaker reasoned,  because it is protected by the  U.S. Constitution's First

unfair and detrimental to public health and consumer freedom.

   According to U.S. government data, between 1987 and 1992, the second fastest

Clinics of Health Practitioners-Not Listed Elsewhere," this category includes
acupuncturists, dieticians, midwives, naturopaths, nutritionists, nurses, Christian
Science practitioners, and 12 other specialties. This category, representing 22,260
offices, grew by 163.1% (from 12,044 offices) compared to the number of new offices
of conventional doctors, which grew by only 56.3%, dentists, which grew by 47.9%, and
osteopaths, which grew by 71.7%.  The number of chiropractic offices expanded by
80.7%-from 20,065 to 27,329. The category with the greatest growth was in home
health care, which grew by 244%; this category, incidentally, is often provided by
nurses, who tend to be more open to alternative medicine approaches.
