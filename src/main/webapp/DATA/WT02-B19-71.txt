<i><U>Professor W.L. Cleghorn</U></i><p>
     Analysis and design of high speed flexible mechanisms (kinetoelastodynamics).  Finite
element analysis applied to vibrations. See also <A HREF="cleghorn/main.html">Research and Projects</A>.<p>

<i><U>Professor R.G. Fenton</U></i><p>
     Kinematics of mechanisms and machines.  Dynamics.  Elasticity, plasticity and stress
analysis.  Design of mechanisms, machines and special purpose robots.  Finite element analysis. <p>

<i><U>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</U></i><p>
     Dynamics modelling of systems with holonomic and non-holonomic constraints.
Algebraic theory (screw) for characterization of kinematics, dynamics & statics of constrained
systems.  Application to control systems. Control of systems with indefinite inner
products. <p> 

<i><U>Professor S.A. Meguid</U></i><p>
     The purpose of this research activity is to apply advanced analytical and numerical
techniques to evaluate the structural integrity of critical components in the aerospace, power
generation and automotive industries. Of particular interest, to this research program, is the
study of anisotropy and inhomogeneity and their effect upon the crack initiation, crack
propagation and possible crack arrest in both traditional and advanced composite materials.  For
further information, see the book on <i>"Engineering Fracture Mechanics"</i> by <i>S.A. Meguid</i>.  For
example, the work is typically concerned with blade fixing in aeroengine discs, interfaces as in
welded constructions in the power generation industry, microcracking and bridging in advanced
ceramics and their composites.  This work is currently being conducted in the Fracture and
Failure Analysis Laboratory. <p>

<i><U>Professor J.K. Mills</U></i><p>
     Dynamic modelling of robots with structural compliance, i.e. link, transmission flexibility
effects.  Analysis of high frequency dynamic characteristics using the theory of singular
perturbations.  Modelling of payloads with structural compliance using distributed parameter
models generated analytically and with dynamic finite element analysis methods. <p>

<i><U>Professor F.P.J. Rimrott</U></i><p>
     The study of one aspect of shell theory is undertaken, viz. the response of slit tubing
to loading, in support of design and analysis of extendible antenna masts and collapsible
structural booms for spacecraft.  Tension field theory is applied to membranes with in-plane
body forces, in support of design and analysis of solar power generation panels for spacecraft. 
Longstanding involvement in gyrodynamics of dissipative bodies has led to the establishment
of the collinearity theorems for single body solid gyroscopes, which form the basis for ongoing
studies of attitude stability and attitude drift of spinning spacecraft. There is work underway in
the application of chaos theory to mechanical systems, and research is undertaken in analytical
mechanics into the application of the concepts of energy and complementary energy for
mechanical systems. <p>

<i><U>Professor A.N. Sinclair</U></i><p>
     Both analytical and experimental work is conducted on resonant frequencies and
mechanical wave propagation characteristics of engineering structures.  This has led to the
development of an ultrasonic high-cycle fatigue problem, whereby the crack propagation
characteristics of aerospace alloys are studied by using ultrasound to promote crack propagation. <p>

<i><U>Professor J.K. Spelt</U></i><p>
     The broader application of structural adhesive bonding is hindered by a general lack of
engineering design principles.  Our research focuses on the development of a comprehensive
methodology for the prediction of the fracture of bonded joints.  The challenge is to create a
design method which is applicable to joints of arbitrary geometry, made of any structural
adhesive, and subject to all types of quasi-static, cyclic or constant loads.  In parallel, we are
investigating the failure mechanisms of bonded joints, and developing ways of incorporating
environmental degradation into the fracture-based failure criterion.  Various elements of non-
destructive evaluation are being used to assess the degradation of adhesive joints. <p>

<i><U>Professor J. Van de Vegte</U></i><p>
     Vibration Control of Rotating Systems. The project is concerned with analytical and
experimental work for the balancing of large rotating systems without interrupting operation.
Thus far, flexible shaft systems with two balancing planes were considered, and current work
aims at extending this to multirotor systems with more than two balancing planes. <p>

<i><U>Professor R.D. Venter</U></i><p>
     Structural integrity, fatigue and fracture of metals.  Special applications relate to the
investigation into the crack propagation of ductile ferritic steels employed in the nuclear
industry.  Development of J and CTOA resistance curves for design of nuclear piping systems. <p>

<i> <u> Professor J.W. Zu </u></i><p>
Research focuses on mechanical vibrations, dynamics and stability analysis of conservative
and non-conservative systems, self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint systems.  Both linear and non-
linear vibrations are considered.  System modeling is established based on the fundamental
principles of mechanics.  Solutions are obtained via analytical or numerical approaches.  In the
analytical approach, modal expansion technique is one of the main methods adopted.  In the
numerical simulation, finite element method is the main tool to tackle the problems. 
Experiments on vibration measurements, testing and modal analysis are also part of the research
to complement the theoretical and numerical work.  Particular attention in the research is given
to structural dynamics and rotordynamics.<p>
