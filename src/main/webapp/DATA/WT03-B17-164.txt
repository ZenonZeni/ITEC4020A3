MATERIALS AND METHODS<BR>

Experimental set-up.<BR>

An experiment with three enclosures was carried out between 9 March and 9 May 1996, at the 
Marine Biological Field Station, Bergen, Norway. The enclosures had a diameter of 2 m, 7 m 
deep and contained 18.5 m3 water. They were made of polyethylene which has 90 % light 
transmission. The enclosures were installed around a raft with a small floating laboratory. Each 
enclosure was filled by pumping water through a 50 um plankton net from 1.5 m depth in the 
fjord on 9 March. Due to a less successful screening procedure also unscreened water was 
introduced to the bags. An airlift system was installed to keep the watermass inside

the enclosures in circulation. Nutrients were added to the bags, at equal N-Si-P ratios, three 
times during the experimental period. The nutrients, nitrate (NaNO3), silicate (Na2SiO3) and 
phosphate (K2HPO4) were supplied from stock solutions. The water in the enclosures was not

renewed during the experimental period.<P>



Collection of females<BR>

Female <i>C. finmarchicus</i> were collected in the Ravnefjorden using a 1.5 m diameter net with a 
mesh of 500 um. Samples were taken at 50, 80, or 100 m during vertical hauls, or 5, 50 or 100 
m for 15 mins, while the ship was drifting. The eggs were collected following two methods:<P>

The first method, the whole samples were transferred directly to 100 l containers bubbled with 
air. In the second method, females were sorted into plastic cylinders with a 300 um mesh bot-
tom and suspended in a 40 l aquarium. The time between capture and start of incubation was 
usually under 3 h. In the two methods, the eggs were extracted after 24 hours by siphoning and 
transferred to 4 l beakers. The numbers of nauplii were recorded 2-3 days after egg incubation,

and the nauplii were stored for 1 to 10 days in beakers. Then, the nauplii were transferred to 2 
enclosures, A and B. A new estimation of the total number of nauplii was made just prior to 
injection to the enclosures (Table 1). Therefore, the initial cohort of nauplii was a combination 
of stage NI and NII for each enclosure. Stage NIII may also have been present in enclosure A. 
Enclosure C represent the natural mesozooplankton community which were not removed 
during the pre-screening procedure of the enclosure water.<P>

Sampling.<BR>

The enclosures were sampled during the period 23 March - 9 May. Samples from the meso-
cosms representing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 meters depth were conducted with a 3-litre heart-valve 
water sampler and pooled in a container. Subsamples from the container were selected for the 
chemical and biological measurements. Temperature and salinity were measured every second 
day Ph was measured directly in the water-sampler in the depth intervals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 
meter.<P>



Nutrients. <BR> 

Samples for the determination of nutrient concentration were immediately frozen after sam-
pling (- 18 oC) and will be analysed on an automatic nutrient analyser.<P>



Chlorophyll a.  Samples of 1 to 2 l for chl a measurements were filtered onto Whatman GF/C 
(47 mm) filters. Filtration started 1 hour after collection and the samples were spectrophotome-
tric determined in ethanol extract on a Novaspec II Spectrophotometer. Fractionated Chl a  < 
10 um was measured in the water after gentle inverted filtration through a 10 um screen. <P>



CHN.  <BR>

Samples of 1 to 2 l for CHN measurements were filtered onto muffled Whatman GF/C (47 
mm) filters. The filter was wrapped in muffled aluminium foil and stored at - 18¯C.<P>



Bacteria, nanoflagellates and ciliates.  Samples for measurements of abundance of bacteria, 
auto- and heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates were taken every second day.<P>



Microzooplankton. <BR>

Production (< 200 um) experiments were conducted every fourth day. Two samples represen-
ting each mesocosm was gently collected from the pooled water samples by inverted filtration 
through a 200 um net every fourth day. The screened water was decanted to 2 l Nalgene bottles 
and mounted on a plankton wheel (speed: 4 rpm) for 24 and 48 h incubation, at in situ tempe-
rature and dim light. Growth rate was determinated in each experiment.<P>



Mesozooplankton. <BR>

The Calanus stocks in the bags were monitored every fourth day by plankton net hauls. 100 
um mesh samples were analysed for copepod abundance and stage development, growth in 
terms of length, growth in terms of carbon and nitrogen content; lipid deposition during 
developmental stages and gonad development. To distinguish between the different nauplii and 
copepodite developmental stages, length criteria after Unstad and Tande (1991) and number of 
urosome segments was used for copepodits and body length. The numbers and arrangements 
of the spines at the posterior end of the body was used for the nauplii. <P>



Preliminary results and experience <BR>

The experimental set-up seems to be very suitable for studying <I>C. finmarchicus</I> cohorts. 
During our 50 days experimental period the animals has developed from early nauplii to late

copepodits. Mature males and females was also observed during the latest sampling days. For 
the experiments in 1997 we are planning to introduce OPC-techniques to monitor the popula-
tion and density, and thereby improve our data on mortality rates among the developmental 
stages of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> cohorts.<P>

Objectives.<BR>

Based on our experince from the mesocosm set-up in Bergen in spring 96 we found that  the 
experimental set-up was suitable for studying C. finmarchicus cohorts. During the 50 days 
experimental period in 1996 the animals developed from early nauplii to late copepodits. 
Mature males and females were also observed during the latest sampling days. The mesocosm 
set-up in 1997 will provides an opportunity to study:<BR>

Copepod abundance and stage development.<BR>

Copepod growth in terms of carbon and nitrogen content<BR>

Lipid deposition during developmental stages<BR>

Mortality estimations based on OPC<BR>

Gonad development<BR>

Effect of light on entry to diapause<BR>

Biomass and production of phytoplankton,<BR>

Fractionated chlorophyll and CHN<BR>

Biomass and production of bacteria,<BR>

Biomass of heterotrofhic nanoflagellates,<BR>

Biomass of ciliates.<P>



Logistics.<BR>

The research vessel "Hans Brattstöm" will be reserved in week 11 and 12.Three fjords will be 
monitored for standing stock of Calanus females (Ravnefjorden, Korsfjorden, Lurefjorden). 
The best locality will be chosen and females will be catched by a special designed Beam-trawl 
or alternative WP2-nets in oversize. Kurt Tande is responsible for development of the beam-
trawl. Samples from the plankton net hauls willbe sorted immediately on board the vessel and 
Calanus females will be placed in containers in dark. Four TASC participants will be on board

the vessel ca. 10 hour per day in 4-5 days during this activity. We expect to sort out 5,000 
females per day. If we succeed with the beam-trawl, we may save time on the sea.<P>



Mesocosm set-up.<BR>

The mesocosms will be installed on the raft during week 10. Five mesocosms ( 2 m in diameter 
and 7 m depth = volume 18.5 m3) will be installed. We need 5 rafts supporting the mesocosms 
and four pontoons between the rafts. Air lift systems will be installed in all bags controlled by 
one pump. The mesocosms will be filled with pre-screened water (< 50 um). The set-up of the 
mesocosms involves two TASC participants in four days.<P>



Laboratory set-up for treatments of females.<BR>

A double container system will be used, where females are placed in the inner container and 
eggs can sediment out through a 300 umnets placed in the bottom of the inner container. In this 
way egg canibalism should be reduced.<P>
