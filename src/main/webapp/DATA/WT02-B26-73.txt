<A NAME = "evide"><H2>EVIDENCE OF NEED FOR RESEARCH</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In 1993, America spent less on medical research in the entire year than it did on health care in ten days.  Ninety-one percent of Americans, according to a nationwide Harris Poll, believe the United States should spend more on medical research to better diagnose, prevent, and treat disease. 
<P>
These facts--highlights from "Medical Research:  Progress and Promise for the Patient," a Research!America Forum consensus statement--drive home the need to promote medical research as an integral element of healthcare reform.
<P>
The consensus statement (with the endorsement of about 150 organizations, including NAMI, then and 217 organizations now) was hand-delivered to every member of Congress, sent to the White House, and forwarded to policy leaders at health and research-related agencies.  For more information about this advocacy effort and how you can help, write or call Research!America, 1522 King Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-2717.  703/739-2577.

<A NAME = "genef"><H2>GENE FOR MANIC DEPRESSION</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A gene, or possibly two, that could contribute to as many as one in four cases of manic depression may be on a region of chromosome 18, according to a study of 395 members of 22 families by Wade H. Berrettini and colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. 
<P>
Manic depression or recurrent depression afflicted 167 participants in the study; in eight of the families, similar genetic variations on chromosome 18 were identified.  Although this means almost two-thirds of the families had no evidence of involvement by chromosome 18, that alone would not rule out the locations:  Most scientists seeking the genetic basis of manic-depressive illness agree that more than one genetic miscue probably can set the state for, or cause, the disorder. 
<P>
The study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (June 21), noted two genes worthy of suspicion out of the approximately 100 genes on chromosome 18.  One codes for a protein that plays a specific part in chemical signal reception; the other is involved in stress hormone production, a physiological function that has been shown to go into overdrive in both depression and manic depression.

<A NAME = "inade"><H2>INADEQUATE DEPRESSION TREATMENT</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A study of the recognition and treatment of depression has found that only 23 percent of depressed patients who could benefit from anti-depressants were receiving these medications and 39 percent of them were getting sub-therapeutic doses. 
<P>
Published in the May 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry, the study by Dr. Kenneth B. Wells of the RAND Corporation also found that patients of psychologists and allied mental health professionals were less likely to receive anti-depressants regardless of the severity of their illness.  Additionally, depressed patients in HMOs were twice as likely to receive fewer visits and to be treated with anti-anxiety medications instead of anti-depressants. 
<P>
These results reinforce previous research showing that insufficient numbers of depressed patients are receiving appropriate treatment and that clinicians often fail to provide the kinds of treatment indicated by efficacy studies.

<P>
Wolfram syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that leads to an array of symptoms, including diabetes mellitus and blindness.  More important, the syndrome's victims usually suffer from severe nervous system abnormalities that can be accompanied by behavior problems, psychiatric hospitalizations and--in 25 percent of cases--suicide attempts. 
<P>
Now scientists at the National Center for Human Genome Research's Laboratory of Genetic Disease Research and the New York Medical College have used a kind of genetic assessment called linkage analysis to home in on the likely location of the Wolfram gene:  the short arm of chromosome 4.
<P>
Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that to be affected, an individual must inherit two mutated genes, one from each parent.  Between one in 50,000 to 100,000 people in this country inherit Wolfram syndrome. 
<P>
Although the syndrome itself is rare, experts estimate that about 1 in 100--or as many as 2.5 million Americans--possess a single copy of the mutated gene.  Because these individuals, as well as close relatives of people with Wolfram syndrome, experience higher-than-normal rates of psychiatric illness, eventual isolation of the gene may shed light on the contribution of genes to psychiatric disorders.
<P>
Armed with that information, investigators hope to identify the function of a gene that, they note, "may be responsible for a significant proportion of psychiatric illness in the general population."  Senior author of the Wolfram gene study was Mihael H. Polymeropoulos of the Laboratory of Genetic Research at the Division of Intramural Research.  It was published in the September 1994 issue of Nature Genetics.

<P>
Rodent pelts stored in museums since the late 1800s provide the first evidence that Lyme disease (borrelia burgdorferi) caused by tick bites has been around in the U.S. for at least 100 years.  This disease, which is rapidly increasing in certain areas, has been shown to have neuropsychiatric manifestations in a paper by Brain A. Fallon, M.D., et al, titled "The Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis."  The study can be obtained from Morris Area Lyme Support, P.O.Box 1483, Morristown, NJ 07960.  201/267-4251.

<A NAME = "manic"><H2>MANIC DEPRESSION AND AUTISM</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
According to a recent study at the Duke University Medical Center, some cases of autism may be associated with a family history of depressive illness.  Autism, a disorder marked by social withdrawal and an inability to interact with the environment, seems to appear more frequently in families with a strong history of bipolar illness, the study found.
<P>
In connection with his study of 40 autistic children, Duke researcher Dr. Robert DeLong reported in the journal Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology that in 14 of the cases reviewed there was a strong family history of depression or manic depressive illness. 
<P>
The study hypothesized that when manic depression strikes in early infancy, it may blunt the child's cognitive, social, and emotional development irreversibly, so that the child's brain never develops the framework in which to build communications skills.  In extreme cases, this may lead to clinical autism.  (Reprinted from the National DMDA Newsletter, vol. 7, no. 1)

<P>
The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) recently published a background paper, Mental Disorders and Genetics:  Bridging the Gap Between Research and Society, that reflects discussion at a 1993 workshop cosponsored by OTA and NIMH.  The paper updates research on the genetics of selected mental disorders and considers the implications of these studies for future research, clinical practice, and society at large. 
<P>
Research makes clear that genetic factors contribute to many of the severe mental disorders discussed in the report.  "Indeed, researchers have already located, and in some cases identified, specific genes involved in Alzheimer's disease.   The consistent evidence for a genetic contribution to schizophrenia and major mood disorders, together with the rapid advances in molecular genetics, makes continued research in this area a promising endeavor. 
<P>
But progress is likely to be slow, given the complexity of theses conditions," write the authors.  Workshop testimony also made clear that genetic research carries with it clinical, ethics, and social implications.  People with mental disorders and their families worry about the genetic risk for a serious mental disorder that their family members may face.  
<P>
They welcome the de-stigmatizing influence of this research.  Yet they fear its potential abuse.  Unfortunately, a gap separates scientifically based information from the people who need it:  people with mental disorders, their family members, care providers, and society in general.

<A NAME = "murde"><H2>MURDERERS' BRAINS FOUND DIFFERENT</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Comparing the brains of 22 men and women undergoing psychiatric evaluation in cases of murder or attempted murder with the brains of 22 control subjects, scientists at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California at Irvine (UCI) found significantly lower rates of glucose uptake in the medial and lateral sections of the prefrontal cortex brain regions of the research subjects compared to the controls. 
<P>
Researchers used positron emission tomography to measure glucose uptake in various brain areas during the performance of simple, repetitive tasks.   Study director Adrian Raine, Ph.D., said the study--published in the July issue of Biological Psychiatry and reported in the September issues of the Psychiatric Times--is the first to establish an activity deficit in a group of severely violent criminals. 
<P>
Because of the selected nature of the sample, however, the findings cannot yet be generalized to other violent populations, nor can this test yet be used as a predictor.

<P>
Neuroscientist Looks Inside The Brain
<P>
by Carol Rees, NAMI Board Member
<P>
To Dr. Daniel Weinberger, schizophrenia is arguably the worst
disease affecting mankind, even including AIDS. The disease has
ruined the lives of millions of people.
<P>
That's why he's so excited about the research he's doing as chief
of the Clinical Brain Disorders branch at the National Institute
of Mental Health.
<P>
In talks at the NAMI 1992 convention in Washington, and again on
September 16, 1992 at the University of Michigan Department of
Psychiatry, Weinberger discussed his hypotheses about
schizophrenia as a brain disorder that alters the structure,
function, and chemical mechanisms of the brain.
<P>
New technology such as CAT scans (computerized axial tomography)
and MRI's (magnetic resonance imaging) have taught
neuroscientists much about the brain, Weinberger says, as have
two studies of identical and fraternal twins, and observations of
laboratory rats with behaviors that mimic schizophrenia.
<P>
Schizophrenia changes the brain's anatomy, he says. Some of the
changes may be subtle, and include enlarged ventricles, decreases
in brain mass, and decreases in the size of a small structure at
the base of the brained call hippocampus.
<P>
Such changes are present before symptoms first appear in patients
with schizophrenia, possibly from birth, Weinberger says.
<P>
Functional alterations in the brain can be observed from
communication between the limbic system (of which the hippocampus
is a part) and the prefrontal cerebral cortex ("gray matter"),
where information processing takes place.
<P>
Chemical alterations in the brain can be observed when a
schizophrenic patient over-reacts to stress. These patients show
a greater sensitivity to dopamine receptors in the brain.
<P>
One underlying problem in schizophrenia, according to Dr.
Weinberger, is a malfunction of nerve cells that connect the
limbic system to the pre-frontal cortex.
<P>
This leads to a loss of ability to remember and to use
information to guide decisions.
<P>
This can be demonstrated with the Wisconsin Card Sort test, a
simple sorting exercise in which cards are sorted according to
designs on the cards.
<P>
Persons with schizophrenia have difficulty sorting the designs,
even though they are told how to do it (by color or shape)
immediately before they begin.
<P>
The persist in responding in an inappropriate way, showing that
they are unable to make use of information they have just been
given.
<P>
This kind of memory loss has not been previously noted as a
characteristic of schizophrenia, because it was masked by the
delusions and hallucinations that accompany the illness.
<P>
Dr. Weinberger says a condition similar to schizophrenia can be
induced in laboratory rats by creating a lesion in the area just
back of the pre-frontal cortex. The animals become highly active
when placed in a novel environment, and they react to mild
stresses as it if were life-threatening.
<P>
The results of stress are long-lasting; even seven days later,
the rats still have an excess of dopamine. Even though the lesion
is present in the rat's brain from the first week of life, this
reaction does not occur until after puberty, just as with
schizophrenia.
<P>
An additional insight gained by this line of research is the
connection between brain age and the appearance of symptoms.
Perhaps a brain must reach a certain state of development before
schizophrenia can occur.
<P>
At earlier ages, people may be protected from decisions by adults
who make decisions on their behalf. Maturity may bring both the
necessity of using information independently to guide behavior,
and an increase in stress, precipitating the onset of psychoses.
<P>
If abnormal cells in the brain's internal communication system
can explain much of what characterizes schizophrenia, then
treatment can be directed at finding ways to prevent this injury
in early life, and to develop drugs that improve communication,
rather than just the ones that affect neurotransmitters.
<P>
Author's note: listening to Dr. Weinberger, and having lunch with
him after his University of Michigan presentation helps me to be
more understanding of my son when he seems unable to heed what we
tell him. It brings home that we are getting closer to an
explanation (and better treatment) for this devastating disease.

<A NAME = "newdi"><H2>NEW DISCOVERY OF MOLECULE IN BRAIN</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Studies by scientists at The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions suggest that the brain uses a common chemical to adjust the speed and intensity of the messages carried through its circuits.  Researchers showed that adding a phosphate molecule to brain cells can make it easier for messages to go through.  The demonstration provides important insight into the tools the brain uses to create learning and memory.  The same tools may also play a role in brain damage from strokes and other disorders.
<P>
Richard Huganir, Ph.D., associate professor of neuroscience and an associate investigator at Howard Hughes Molecular Genetics Institute, studied phosphate molecules' effects on certain receptors, sites on nerve cells that open in response to chemical messengers from other nerve cells. 
<P>
While the receptors are open, calcium and sodium from around the nerve cell flow into it, triggering a series of electrical and chemical chain-reactions that transmit the message up the nerve cell.  "A single receptor that we studied probably has 10 to 20 different sites where this phosphate molecule can be added, and each of these sites has different effects on the receptor," explains Huganir.  "
<P>
At one site, phosphorylation increases the amount of time the receptor is open," says Huganir.  "Another affects the concentration of receptors, causing more to gather in a particular area."  When a receptor is open longer or more receptors are gathered together, more of the calcium surrounding the cell flows into it, making the message come through more easily and more strongly.
<P>
Huganir presented his findings at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in November in Miami Beach.

<A NAME = "newge"><H2>NEW GENE LINKED TO BIPOLAR DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In the largest study to date using linkage analysis for bipolar, researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute, part of columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem have found evidence that a region on chromosome 21 contains a gene for the disorder. 
<P>
The study involved more than 900 people from 47 families in the U.S. and Israel with a high concentration of bipolar disorder.  One U.S. family consisting of 67 individuals included 18 members who had diagnoses ranging from bipolar disorder to recurrent major depression to cyclothymia.  The researchers found that DNA markers from region q22.3 of chromosome 21 gave evidence of linkage to the disorder in this family and, possibly, in other families as well.
<P>
The study comes on the heels of other recent findings showing a possible site on chromosome 18, which may also be partly responsible for manic-depressive symptoms.  Still earlier studies have shown a possible relation between chromosome 11 and bipolar illness.  (Reprinted from the National DMDA Newsletter, vol. 7, no. 1)
<P>


<A NAME = "newst"><H2>NEW STUDY ON BIPOLAR DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A new treatment-outcome and research network dedicated to the study of manic-depressive illness, the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network, includes national and international researchers and expert clinicians working in close association with NAMI and the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association (NDMDA). 
<P>
These groups will work together to assess the efficacy of existing treatments for bipolar disorder and the development of new therapeutic agents.  Participating research centers will recruit and treat patients with bipolar illness using standard protocols and assessments within randomized clinical trials. 
<P>
"The mission of the bipolar network is to advance the scientific knowledge and understanding of bipolar illness, its cause or causes, and its treatments with the goals of establishing optimal treatment strategies," said Robert Post, M.D., chief of the Biological Psychiatry Branch of NIMH. 
<P>
More information about this network is available in Bipolar Network News (BNN), a newsletter about the latest bipolar-disorder findings for patients and clinicians.  For a copy of BNN, write or fax your request to Bipolar Network News,  5430 Grosvenor Lane, Suite #200,
