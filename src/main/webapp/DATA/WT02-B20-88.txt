<B><I>What is muscular dystrophy?

</B></I><P>This file includes information about children with muscular dystrophy.  At the end of the file are links to Internet resources and Internet listservs (discussion groups) where you can obtain more specific information on the topic. 
There may be ERIC digests that provide information on related topics.

The primary focus of the ERIC system is education.  While the ERIC database contains information on some medical disorders and related disabilities, you may want to search a medical database such as <a href=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/> MEDLINE/MEDLARS </a> at the National Library of Medicine or <a href=http://www.gen.emory.edu/medweb/medweb.disabled.html#Institutes and agencies>
MedWeb </a> at Emory University.<P>

Enclosed are several citations from the ERIC database.  These records are a
sample of the kind of information you can find in the ERIC database.  For more
citations on your topic of interest, you may want to <a href=http://ericir.syr.edu/ERIC/eric.html>
search the ERIC database  yourself </a> on the Internet. <P>

References with ED (ERIC Document) and EJ (ERIC Journal) identifiers are cited  in
the ERIC database; for example, ED333123 or EJ333999.  ERIC documents are
available in microfiche collections at more than 825 locations worldwide (check your
local college or public library). They can also be ordered for a fee  through the ERIC
Document Reproduction Service (EDRS) at 1-800-443-ERIC. <P> References with an
EJ (ERIC Journal) number are available for a fee from the originating journal (check
with your local college or public library), through  interlibrary loan services, or from
article reproduction clearinghouses,  such as UMI: 1-800-248-0360; or ISI:

The following information is excerpted from <a href=http://www.mda.org.au> Muscular Dystrophy Association, Australia</a><P>

What is Muscular Dystrophy ?<BR>
   The terms covers over 40 separate Neuromuscular disorders which
   have in common the progressive and irreversible wasting of muscle
   tissue. Some of these diseases are known as dystrophies, the wasting
   of the muscles from within themselves. Others are atrophies, wasting
   arising from a disorder originating in the nerve system which causes
   loss of the ability to use muscles. Various Myopathies, Peripheral
   Nerve and Metabolic Disorders also fall into the realm of disorders
   covered by the MDA's program. These Neuromuscular disorders (NMD's)
   are generally, incorrectly, termed "muscular dystrophy".<P>

  The effects of passive exercise of the extremities on peripheral vision of 
muscular dystrophic children aged 9 to 13 years was investigated.  Compared to 
control subjects, those who experienced six minutes of passive exercise 
evidenced increased peripheral vision.  Curriculum revisions for muscular 
dystrophic children indicate the importance of activity in facilitating 
learning.  (Author/RD)<BR>
