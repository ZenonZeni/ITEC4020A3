<H2>Does Depot Medication Improve Compliance?</H2></center>

 <HR>


	"One cause of the gap between the theoretical and actual effectiveness of neuroleptic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia is the persistently high rate of patient noncompliance," wrote Peter Weiden when reporting on a compliance research study in Psychiatric Services (October 1995).  "For example, our research group found that 74 percent of schizophrenic outpatients become noncompliant with their neuroleptic regiment within two years of discharge from the hospital."
<P>
	In a preliminary study of 93 neuroleptic-responsive inpatients to determine whether administering medication by the depot route rather than orally improves compliance with neuroleptic treatment after inpatients leave the hospital, Peter Weiden, M.D., et al found mixed results.  Inpatients converted to depot medication had significantly better compliance at one month postdischarge; however, the initial positive effect on compliance waned.  No significant differences in compliance were found between the oral and depot groups at six and 12 months postdischarge.
<P>
	Although Weiden and his colleagues concluded that "converting inpatients to depot therapy significantly improved short-term but not long-term medication compliance after discharge," they also concluded that depot treatment "can be used as a way to promote the transition to outpatient services."
