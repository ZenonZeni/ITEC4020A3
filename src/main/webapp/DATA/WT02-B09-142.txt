A.  Before the Egg Retrieval
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><B>What<A HREF="C:/endocrine/Preliminary Testing.htm"> preliminary testing </A>is needed for myself and partner?</B><br>
Refer to the IVF packet for a list of all needed tests.  Please note that cultures need to be scheduled on weekdays only.  It takes ten days to get the results.  You should call the office where you had the testing done to make sure all of the testing is negative.
<li><B>Because I live a distance from the office, can I have my prelimary testing done at my docotrs office?</B><br>
We prefer that you have your reliminary testing done in the office the day you have the initial IVF consult and mock transfer, but other arrangements can be made if necessary.
<li>
<B>Is the male partner required to freeze a semen specimen and if so, can he do it with the inital semen analysis and cultures?<br>
</B>It is strongly suggested that a semen specimen be frozen prior to the egg retrieval.  If the male partner is ill on the day of the retrieval, the frozen specimen can be used to inseminate the eggs.  A separate specimen of semen is needed to freeze and it should not be produced until the cultures have been cleared.  You must schedule an appointment with the Andrology Lab for a semen freeze.
<li>
<B>If I had the Hysterosalpingogram (the X-Ray of the uterus and tubes) done before, do I need to repeat it?</b><br>
No, not unless the test was done many years prior or you had a surgical procedure since your last hysterosalpingogram.  Ask the IVF nurse if there are any questions.
<li>
<B>How do I know which doctor will be doing my retrieval and transfer?</B><br>
The IVF docotrs rotate for a period of time.  The rotation begins with Monday and ends with Sunday.
<li>
<B>How do I knwo what medication I will be taking and when to take it?</B><br>
During the IVF consult with the doctor, he/she will discuss with you the best medication stimulation protocol that you should be using.  An instruction sheet and prescriptions will be given to you.
<li>
<B>What should I do if I get my period, (cycle day 1), at night or on a weekend?</B><br>
you should leave your name, date and phone number on our answering machine, (609)751-3570.  If you need instructions or have questions, please ask us to return your call. We will call you back the next day.  If you need immediate instructions, you should call (609) 751-5575 and leave a message with the service to have the doctor return you call.
<li>
<B>If I do not know how to take the injectable medication, what should I do?</B><br>
You need to schedule a consult with an IVF nurse.  The person that will be giving you the medication should be present at the time of consult.  Generally these consults are best done between 2:00PM and 5:00PM, depending on the IVF schedule.

<a name="during"></a>
B.  During the Egg Retrieval
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><b>How long does the egg retrieval take?<br></B>
Depending on the number of follicles that are present, the time may vary from one to one and one half hours.  You should plan on being at the IVF suite for a minimum of three hours.
<li><B>Is the egg retrieval a painful procedure?</B><br>
Generally, most patients are asleep during the procedure.  We usually administer Fentanyl an dVersed intravenously during the procedure.  These are very potent pain relievers and therefore most women tolerate the procedure with a minimum amount of discomfort.
<li><B>How will I feel after the egg retrieval?</B><br>
Usually patients compain of feeling sleepy.  Occasionally they will experience some abdominal discomfort.  The day after the egg retrieval some patients decide to return to work, which is fine if you feel well enough.  If you can afford the time off from work, we would encourage you to stay at home because you may not feel quite up to par.
<li><B>When is my male partner required to produce the semen specimen?</B><br>
On the day of egg retrieval, the Embryologist will inform you when the time is proper for you to produce.  We have private rooms available for your use.  If you have a specific problem, i.e., time constraints or difficulty producing, you should discuss this with an embryologist in advance of the egg retrieval.
<li><B>Does every follicle contain an egg?</B><br>
No. In fact, sometimes if the estradiol is very high it is difficult to see every follicle, so we may get many more eggs at time of retrieval than number of follicles seen on ultrasound.  Unfortunately, when the estradiol is low and only one or two follicles are present on ultrasound, there may not be an egg in the follicle.  This is called empty follicle syndrome.  We will prescan you prior to the egg retrieval if you have a small number of follicles present on ultrasound day of hCG.

<a name="after"></a>
C.  After the Egg Retrieval
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><B>Will every egg fertilize?</B>
<br>Our normal fertilization rate is approximately 65%.  Some patients have a much higher rate of fertilization and occasionally a few patients will unfortunately have no ferilization.  If you do not get 100% fertilization with the first day insemination, we will encourage the male partner to return to the IVF suite the next day to produce another semen specimen so that we may attempt to increase the number of fertilized oocytes (eggs).
<li><B>When are the embryos frozen?</B><br>
They can either be frozen the day after the egg retrieval, called the 2 Pronuclear stage, or the day of the ET or the day after that, if they appear normal.</OL>
<p>

<a name="transfer"></a>
D.  After the Embryo Transfer<br>

<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li><B>How long can embryos stay in frozen storage before being used?</B><br>
No one knows the exact answer to this question.  In our program, several women have delivered healthy, normal babies when the embryos were stored for 5 years in our laboratory.
<li><B>After my transfer, will all of my remaining embryos be frozen?</B><br>
Not all embryos go through normal cell division.  If the embryos do not appear normal, they will be discarded in the lab.  The Embryologist will call you 2-3 days after your transfer to tell you the total number of embryos that were frozen.  ALL EMBRYOS THAT LOOK NORMAL WILL BE FROZEN.
<li><B>When can I resume normal acitivities, i.e., driving, walking steps, going to work, etc.?</B><br>
48 hours after the transfer you may resume normal acitivity, unless you have a very strenuous job.  If your job is stenuous, you should discuss this with the doctor.
<li><B>When can I have sexual relations?</B><br>
There have not been any scientific studies done on this subject, but we think it is okay to resume normal sexual realtions after three days from transfer.
<li><B>What is the best position to stay in after the transfer?</B><br>
Lying flat in a bed or couch or reclining in a chair is best.  You may lie on your side or back, whcihever is more comfortable for you.  You should stay reclining except for using the bathroom and showering for 36 hours after the embryo transfer.
<li><B>On the drive home, must I lie flat?</B><br>
Because of the hazards of driving without a seat belt, we advise that you recline in the front seat, if possible, and put your seat belt on.
<li><B>If I live far away, should I stay in a hotel for two days after the transfer?</B><br>
If you live farther than two hours from the office, it would probably be best that you stay in a nearby hotel, at least the night of the embryo transfer.
<li><B>When can I resume strenuous exercise?</B><br>
You may resume strenuous exercise only with the consent of a physician and after you have had your pregnancy test.<br></OL>


We hope that these questions and answers will be helpful to you.  Or course, you should always call if you are unsure of the procedure.</FONT>
