(1) PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNS CDA, WORLD WIDE WEB GOES BLACK

President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Reform Bill, CDA and all, into 
law this morning.  

In response, and in overwhelming numbers, people around the world are making 
their web pages black (with white text) to illustrate the far reaching effect 
of the new online 'indecency' restrictions included in the "Communications 
Decency Act".  Over 1500 sites have indicated their support for the protest, 
including:

* Sen. Patrick Leahy  - http://www.senate.gov/~leahy
* Rep. Jerrold Nadler - http://www.house.gov/nadler/welcome.html
* Yahoo               - http://www.yahoo.com/
* SurfWatch Software  - http://www.surfwatch.com/
* Netcom              - http://www.netcom.com/
* And many others. 

A complete listing is available at http://www.cdt.org/speech.html

The story about the protest, and the concerns of the entire Internet community 
over the new, sweeping restrictions on constitutional speech enacted today, 
are finally getting the attention they deserve in the National media. In 
addition, we've seen an amazing outpouring of support around the country and 
around the world for this effort, and hope you all feel a part of something 
larger than all of us put together.  We certainly do.  

CDT, along with other prominent public interest civil liberties organizations, 
individuals, community groups, and businesses which would be effected by the 
CDA, are preparing a law suit against the provisions to be filed in Federal 
Court very soon.  Details will be announced on this list and posted on CDT's 
web site as they become available.

48 HOUR PROTEST INFORMATION - DARKENING THE WEB

If you have joined the protest, please continue to keep your web page
backgrounds black until Saturday, noon. 

Thank you for participating in the Internet's most visible Internet 
demonstration ever. Together, we are demonstrating that the Internet.Community 
is a growing political force capable of making our concerns felt on a National 
scale. This truly is an historic moment.

More information on the protest, as well as information about the Internet 
-censorship issue (including the text of the final CDA, analysis, and other 
relevant materials) are available at CDT's net-censorship web page:
