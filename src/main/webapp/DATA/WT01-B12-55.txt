 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN B-12</H2>

 <P> Experts agree that the essential nutrient Vitamin B-12 often increases energy and improves memory, appetite (when needed) and digestion. It is an absolute must for the maintenance of a healthy nervous system and is considered by many to play an important role as an anti-aging nutrient.</P>
<P>  Many of the functions of Vitamin B-12, such as building  blood  cells,  promoting  DNA  synthesis, naturally   interfering   with   inflammation   and strengthening the immune system are fundamental to a healthy body.</P>
<P>  Thousands of doctors have given Vitamin B-12 injections over the last several decades to help patients cope with stress, depression and exhaustion to name only a few.  It is true that some of its uses may not be "proven", but it is unlikely that its use would have been continued over the years if both doctors and their patients did not receive benefit from it. Vitamin B-12 has been used to help increase fertility in livestock for many years. A study actually demonstrated that Vitamin B-12 injections increased the sperm count in 27% of men participating that began the study with low levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUBLINGUAL</H2>
<P>  It is well known that the body has a difficult time absorbing Vitamin B-12 through the digestive tract. This is the  primary  reason that Vitamin  B-12  injections became  so  popular  in  the  doctor's  office. LIFE-N-POWER is a slow dissolving lozenge that releases its ingredients in the mouth so that they can be absorbed by the tiny sublingual capillaries.  The term "sublingual'' simply means "under the tongue."  The majority of the Vitamin B-12 and its metabolite, Dibencozide,  contained  in  LIFE-N-POWER  are absorbed this way, assuring much more reliable and consistent uptake in the body. The majority of the complex carbohydrate is also absorbed this way as well, providing more instant energy.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIBENCOZIDE</H2>
<P>  Vitamin B-12, also known an Cobalamine or Cyanocobalamine, plays an important role in nucleic acid and protein synthesis as well as in nitrogen retention, cell division and growth. Target tissues include the central nervous system and skeletal muscle. The primary active form of Vitamin B-12 in the body is a coenzyme commonly called Dibencozide. The body stores the major portion of it vitamin B-12 in the form of Dibencozide and the Dibencozide form is retained in the body by as much as three times better.</P>

<P>  Dibencozide is directly involved in the body's building of muscle tissue. Many doctors specializing in sports  medicine  recommend  Dibencozide  as  a non-hormonal anabolic agent that is natural and effective in helping build strong muscles. It certainly offers the athlete a safe and effective alternative to steroid hormones and is not banned by the international sports community.</P>
<P.  As the metabolically active form of Vitamin B-12. Dibencozide supports protein synthesis, especially in the liver. As such, it has been recommended for individuals of all ages, especially in children and older individuals.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENERGY</H2>
<P>  Our bodies rely on carbohydrates for its primary fuel for energy.  Many people routinely experience drastic changes in blood sugar levels. The continual ingestion of simple carbohydrate (sugars) sensitize the pancreas to over produce insulin which results in low blood sugar levels. This  process  continues  with  time  until hypoglycemia and/or diabetes develops. However, the pancreas is able to handle more complex carbohydrates as they break down to their more simple components and do not create such a demand on the pancreas. LIFE-N-POWER contains complex carbohydrates that can easily and quickly be utilized by the body for energy, yet it does it safely, without the dangers of simple carbohydrate or sugars.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  LIFE-N-POWER is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE LIFE-N-POWER</H2>
 <P> As an energy boosting supplement, LIFE-N-POWER lozenges are simply dissolved slowly in the mouth whenever they are needed. They are useful as a "picker upper'' when dieting, working late, driving at night, or just for the afternoon "blahs." When used to help build muscle, it is best to make sure you take at least three tablets per day. Use them at workout times for energy and increased stamina. LIFE-N-POWER is helpful in maintaining blood sugar levels and each tablet only contains about two calories so they can be used by people wanting to lose weight, too.</P>
