<p>
The academic session generally runs from early 
September to mid-April with a two-week break near the 
end of December. The Department's academic 
curriculum is currently arranged on a term basis with 
courses running from September to December (Fall 
Term), and from January to April (Spring Term).<p>

New graduate students generally arrange their entire 
program of study at the time of registration, so that 
course selections for the Spring term are made also in 
September.
