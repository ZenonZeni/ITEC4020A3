<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>
<I>Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S.
labor market.</I>  In April, a German business magazine published
a cover story about how Germany should regard the U.S. economy
as a role model for labor market reform.  The cover showed a picture
of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200 pounds) trying
to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume.  Shortly after the article
appeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage
job creation, including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to
abolish many expensive government regulations on firms which employ
ten workers or less.  Under the previous law, such rules applied
to firms  employing more than 5 people.  In the U.S., by contrast,
firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until their total
employment exceeds 50 workers.
<P>
The U.S. needs new government policies to improve educational
opportunity while corporations should attempt to broaden employee
participation in stock option programs, but attempts to impose
new regulations on the labor market will be counter productive
to job creation without necessarily reducing wage inequality.
 As education in the U.S. is primarily a responsibility of state
and local governments, it will be difficult for Washington based
politicians to have much impact on the quality of education without
providing much greater federal funding or structural reforms to
promote more competition for the delivery of what is still a monopoly
public good in most communities.
<P>
<I>Several factors suggest that the Republicans should improve
their standing in the opinion polls during September.</I>  Aside
from convention publicity, they will be free from the official
restrictions on campaign spending which were imposed on Mr. Dole
because of his large outlays during the primary season.  Mr. Dole
is also starting to develop more effective campaign themes, such
as school vouchers and tax allowances for small business.  While
these themes will not resolve his problem with highly divisive
issues such as abortion, they should help to energize constituencies
who voted Republican during the 1980's.
<P>
The Clinton personal and financial scandals in Arkansas also will
continue to be a wildcard in the political outlook.  They have
not been a major factor yet because of Mr. Clinton's unique personal
circumstances compared to other presidents.  As Arkansas is perceived
to be a poor corrupt state, many people discount the Clinton financial
scandals as a natural outcome of the state's potential culture.
 As Mrs. Clinton is the most assertive first lady in the history
of the presidency, many male voters believe the president should
be entitled to have mistresses.  What remains unclear is whether
this tolerance for scandals will persist when voters actually
enter the polling booth.  The comments of Mr. Ken Starr to the
media could also have an important effect on voter attitudes.
 If he gives the impression that he might indict Mrs. Clinton
or the president next year, voters could turn against the president
in order to avoid a repetition of the paralysis which crippled
the government during Mr. Nixon's second term.
<P>
While the opinion polls suggest that the Democrats have an opportunity
to recapture the House, four factors suggest the Republicans should
be able to hold onto a small majority.  First, they have raised
a great deal of money and attracted many strong new candidates
as a result of their victory in 1994.  Secondly, many Democratic
incumbents will retire in the south and at least 15-20 of those
seats are potentially good prospects for a Republican takeover.
 Thirdly, there is a significant risk that the election for ten
congressional seats in Texas will be delayed until December in
order to redraw the boundaries to eliminate radical gerry-mandening.
Eight of the ten seats are Democratic seats with good Republican
potential for a take-over.  The delay in the congressional elections
could boost Republican victory prospects by depressing the turnout.
  In special elections, only committed voters turn out compared
to an average of 50-60% for presidential elections.  Finally,
the odds are high that there will be a conservative third party
in the presidential race offering Mr. Ross Perot as its candidate.
 As the Reform Party will not have any congressional candidates,
its voters will probably support the Republicans in most house
races.
<P>
The U.S. dollar fell sharply during July because of the decline
in U.S. bond and equity prices.  The D-mark also benefited from
the failure of the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates at its
pre-vacation meeting in late July.
<P>
As the U.S. economy is enjoying buoyant growth while the economies
of Germany and Japan are much less dynamic, <i>the only factor
which appears capable of producing a sustained dollar correction
is investor concern about the upcoming U.S. elections.  The Bundesbank
appears to have been deadlocked on a rate cut in late July because
several social democratic members of the council missed the meeting</I>.
 When they return in late August, the odds will increase of a
vote to ease further.  Recent Japanese economic data point to
a moderation in that country's growth rate after the spurt to
a 13% growth rate during the first quarter.  Government officials
also have gone out of their way to stress that the Bank of Japan
will not raise interest rates for several months.  Despite the
upturn in GDP growth during the first quarter, Japan continues
to suffer from severe credit quality problems in its banking system
and there are recurring rumors of new bank failures.  As Japanese
officials would be quite happy to see the yen depreciation to
the 110-115 range, they will not feel any impulsion to raise interest
rates even if the Federal Reserve hikes U.S. interest rates by
50 basis points during the next few months.  As a result of these
factors, the dollar should stabilize once U.S. securities market
establish a viable trading range and could rally if U.S. asset
markets bottom in the near future.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize, </B></I>the U.S. economy appears likely to
expand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the third quarter or a
level about 1.0% above the Fed's perception of the economy's non-inflationary
growth rate.  As the unemployment rate is only 5.3% and there
are increasing signs of wage acceleration in the economy, the
odds are high that the Fed will decide to raise interest rates
during August in order to insure that output growth slows to the
2.0-2.5% rate by the fourth quarter.  The Fed tightening, coupled
with investor concern about this autumn's elections for the presidency
and the Congress, could produce a stock market correction during
the third quarter but such an adjustment is preferable to a larger
and more dramatic adjustment during the autumn if the Fed defers
tightening and then has to change its mind.  The poor showing
of Robert Dole in the opinion polls is increasing investor concern
about the Republicans losing control of the Congress but several
factors suggest the Republicans should be able to retain the House
and Senate even if Dole runs several percentage points behind
Clinton.  The dollar is vulnerable to continuing weakness in U.S.
bond and equity prices but it could improve during the late summer
when the Bundesbank finally lowers interest rates.
