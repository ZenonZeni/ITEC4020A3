The therapeutic benefit of a few vitamins was studied in children with
allergic diseases. Bronchial asthma and allergic dermatitis were treated more

Jonathan Wright, MD, advises that "vitamin B12 shots work remarkably well against
wheezing for children and teenagers. Approximately 80 percent have either elimination or
substantial reduction of wheezing. But they take time... you might not see change for
several days, a week, or more."

leading cause of disease and disability in children and teens. Serafina
Corsello, MD, recommends a minimum of 25 milligrams of B6 twice a day-but not to
be taken late at night. This nutrient works with zinc and vitamin C to help
regulate antibodies and also functions as a diuretic to diminish allergic
responses. 
Elimination of wheat and milk from the diet can be very effective in
minimizing or even eliminating asthma symptoms. But according to a report in the
Journal of Pediatric Child Health (Feb 1993, 29:32-5), health professionals who
manage children with asthma have poor knowledge of what contributes to the
illness, such as the use of cow's milk.</I>

        Several studies performed in high-risk babies have demonstrated a
significant reduction in the prevalence and severity of allergic diseases with
the use of dietary and environmental manipulations. It has been demonstrated
that prolonged breast-feeding and the avoidance of cow's milk, avoidance of
[commercial] eggs, and avoidance of fish during the first three months of
lactation significantly decrease both the prevalence and the severity of
allergic disease up to the age of five years.

        Patients having "high risk" breast cancer were treated with antioxidants,
fatty acids, and 90 milligrams of CoQ10. Several of the 32 patients showed
partial tumor regression. In one of these cases, the dosage of CoQ10 was
increased to 390 milligrams. In one month, the tumor could no longer be felt,
and in another month, mammography confirmed the absence ofthe tumor. Encouraged,
another patient having a verified breast tumor was then treated with 300
milligrams of CoQ10. After three months, the patient was in excellent clinical
condition, and there was no residual tumor tissue. The bioenergetic activity of
CoQ10 may be one of the mechanisms causing the regression of breast cancer.

        In older healthy and non-insulin-dependent diabetics, the changes in insulin
secretion and action after vitamin C intake were determined. In both groups, vitamin
C-mediated increase in insulin action was mainly due to an improvement in glucose metabolism.
It was concluded that vitamin C levels play a role in insulin action in older healthy and
diabetic subjects.

A defect in the function of an enzyme (delta-6-desaturase) has been discussed as a 
major
factor in the development of eczema. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of
linoleic acid to gamma linolenic acid. Many factors interfere with this conversion 
process.
Hence, supplementation of gamma linolenic acid in patients prone to developing eczema 
avoids
the conversion process. Patients treated with GLA showed less inflammation, dryness,
scaling, and overall severity compared to controls. Source: Clinical Investigations,

Studies on omega-3 fatty-acid metabolism were done for two main reasons: One, it
lowers intraocular pressure without causing ocular inflammation, and two, some
surveys demonstrated that Greenland Eskimos, whose marine diet is enriched with omega-3
fatty acids , have a lower incidence of glaucoma as compared to Caucasians. Omega-3 appears
to play a role in lowering intraocular pressure.

        Test animals were maintained on a low-fiber (5 percent) or a high-fiber (20 percent)
diet in which the major fiber source was cellulose. The animals were inoculated with an
intestinal parasite. Animals in the low-fiber diet group were much more likely to become
infected than were animals in the high-fiber group. The fiber creates mucus in the gut,
entrapping the parasite. Then it travels to the large intestine, where its demise is 
almost
guaranteed.

The fiber content of the diet after inoculation determined the infection rate. When
infected animals on the low-fiber diet were placed on the high-fiber diet for twenty-four
hours, clearing occurred in the lower small intestine. So, in the case of infections, a
high-fiber regimen can be of help even after infection has set in.

        Pregnancy causes women to awaken with a lowered blood sugar level than occurs in the
nonpregnant state, so pregnant women are more prone to fatigue and even depression. When
protein is ingested, it is broken down into amino acids. The roles ofthe individual amino
acids are many and complex, but among them is the stimulation of hormones that transmit
important substances from brain cell to brain cell, promoting feelings of well-being, with
the number one priority that of regulating blood-sugar levels. A high-quality breakfast
containing good protein is essential for pregnant women. 

<P><B>Source:</B> B Kamen, <I>Total Nutrition
During Pregnancy</I> (New Canaan, CT: Keats Publishing, 1981), p 50. 
<BR><B>Editor's note:</B> <I>Eggs
contain the highest quality of protein. Egg protein has very high digestibility, which
means it is absorbed most efficiently. Since, during pregnancy, there is an increased
need for proteins of high biologic value that will be metabolized with ease, eggs fit the
bill. 
<BR>For greatest nutrient benefit from eggs, they should be fertile and prepared so that
the yolk is still runny: soft boiled, poached, or sunny-side up. If you are concerned about
cholesterol, relax. It has never been shown that heart disease is caused by the
consumption of cholesterol-containing whole, natural foods, especially if one is on a
wholesome, varied diet.</I>

Considering that it weighs only 15 grams, the ability of the prostate to cause
misery as a consequence of bladder outflow obstruction or cancer is astonishing.
Each year in the United States, 34,000 men die of prostate cancer, and the
disease is detected in 140,000 men. (Some reports indicate even higher numbers.)
It is the most common male cancer and the second most common cause ofdeath from
cancer in men. Between 1980 and 1988, the incidence of prostate cancer increased
by 30 percent.

The prostatectomy can be done with great safety, but there are two problems.
It doesn't get to the cause and there is a 50 percent risk of erectile
impotence. To avoid the problem of erectile impotence, let's avoid the cause.
Antioxidant vitamins, such as beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamin E, and
vitamin C, are believed to decrease cancer risk by preventing tissue damage.
Over 100 studies have assessed the relationship of dietary antioxidant intake or
blood nutrient levels with cancer risk.
