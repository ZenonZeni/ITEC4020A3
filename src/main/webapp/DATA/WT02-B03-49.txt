<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

Incorporating over a decade of field-proven marine technology, Quester Tangent's Under Keel Clearance Guide (UKCG) provides status information for the safe and efficient management of port operations. The UKCG system receives data from the Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS) and other oceanographic and meteorological sensors, to provide information, planning tools and emergency alarms. 
<P>
As port operations become increasingly competitive, there is a growing need for more accessible, detailed and accurate port and waterway information by ship operators, VTMS operators and vessel pilots.  Traditionally operators and pilots have relied on tide tables, paper or electronic charts, and a history of local knowledge when determining vessel clearance safety or planning berthing procedures.  These predictions may not take into account day to day changes due to depth, current, tide and weather.
<P>
The UKCG integrates bathymetry, weather, tide, current and vessel squat to predict vessel under keel clearance information for the particular port or waterway.  By integrating this data, the UKCG is used as a forecast tool and alarm system alongside the VTMS. The operator receives an accurate assessment of vessel under keel clearance usingoptimal and real-time data based on accurate forecast and now-cast information<P>


<H3>DESIGN:</H3>
A schematic of a typical UKCG system is shown in Figure 1 which details the operational flow of data to and from the VTMS.  The UKCG system operates in parallel with the VTMS and can receive, process and transmit data to the VTMS operator displays.<P>

<STRONG>Digital Tidal Atlas (DTA):</STRONG><BR>
The DTA accepts requests for water depth and current information from the VTMS to provide real-time and forecast conditions for the port or specific vessel routes. The DTA's tidal predictor is based on a 3-D finite element model tuned and run in the port area.  Adjustments due to weather effects incorporate seasonal variations in water density, actual wind velocity and air pressure.  Data  from permanently installed and strategically placed sensors, such as Doppler current meters and tide gauges is used to validate water depth and water column current forecasts within the DTA.<P>
<STRONG>Squat Predictor (Squat):</STRONG><BR>
The Squat Predictor utilizes water depth and current information, bathymetric data, vessel hull shape information, and actual or forecast speed heading and draught information to predict the vessel draught increase due to its motion through the water. <P>
<STRONG>Under Keel Clearance (UKCG):</STRONG><BR>
The UKCG processes the information and forecasts the vessel's under keel clearance  while providing a confidence level indication.
The now-cast and forecast information is validated by tide and current information from the on-line sensors in the port area. VTMS operators may request information on water depth, current speed and clearance parameters using a graphics interface technology supported by on-line help, alarm and status indicators. Water column currents, surface currents and  time series of currents are displayed for any position in the port region, as well as current information over a  geographic region of interest.<P>

Other information  available from the UKCG system are planning and real-time monitoring tools. For example, &quot;Cross Flow Over Route&quot; is a forecast of the currents across a planned route. &quot;Clearance Over Route&quot; is a graphic display of the forecast clearance as a function of time and position along the planned route. In addition, as the vessel transits the route, real-time positions and speed provide a real-time clearance forecast. This forecast also includes an alarm system for potentially hazardous situations.<P>
The &quot;Safe Passage Window&quot; and &quot;Clearance During Loading&quot; functions are used in rapid investigation of trade-offs, such as increasing cargo with a delayed sailing versus a quicker departure with less cargo.  
<P>
Future enhancements of the UKCG system include installations with remote laptop computers and communication links to the VTMS.  Onboard pilots will have instant access to real-time under keel clearance information.


<P>
The UKCG system can be used in a &quot;stand alone&quot; configuration or integrated into a new or existing VTMS.  The integration of forecast and real-time data, combined with sophisticated mathematical and physical models, allows the system to provide detailed forecast and now-cast tools for the specific port.  Graphical displays show forecasted under keel clearances for a vessel as it transits its route.  Other tools allow for quick analysis of &quot;safe&quot; vessel draught conditions of vessels while loading or entering the port using actual current, tide and vessel speed conditions. 
<P>
The UKCG operators access real-time and forecast prediction information which is used in conjunction with the planning tools, and to assist in making decisions to enhance safe and economical port operations. This information is particularly valuable in ports with limited clearance, strong currents or where lightering operations are required. Berthing and loading operations are optimized and safety enhanced utilizing UKCG forecasts to provide safe transit &quot;windows&quot; and tools that can be used in emergencies.  The UKCG system displays forecast clearance on the vessel's route, allowing the operator to make decisions regarding vessel loading, planned draught, departure times and route selection.
