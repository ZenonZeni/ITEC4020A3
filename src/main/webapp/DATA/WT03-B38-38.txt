Next Challenge: Keep the Data Flowing

   Now that RTC has appeased Congress by publishing its initial real estate
inventory on time, the agency can turn its attention to the more important
task of delivering updated data to investors on a frequent basis.
   In unveiling the nationwide listing of 30,123 properties, RTC Executive
Director David C. Cooke said his agency will soon begin making asset
information available more often than the required semiannual reports.
However, he did not specify whether that meant quarterly or monthly
updates.
   Demand for detailed listings of RTC's holdings seems to be overwhelming,
based on the 22,000 written inquiries received by the agency in recent
months and the heavy order volume for the inventory report last week.
   As a result, entrepreneurs in the technology, publishing and marketing
industries are circling - hoping to help the bailout agency disseminate
fresh data on new properties assumed by RTC, as well as results of recent
sales.
   "The inventory will also be made available through a variety of
computer-compatible media," Cooke said.
   In fact, a consortium of reputable technology companies, not yet willing
to publicize its effort, is working to create a system which would allow
subscribers to use a personal computer to "dial in" to a central database
and conduct sophisticated analysis of RTC assets.
   In addition, the bailout agency has been approached by publishing
ventures that are eager to repackage the property listings to fit specific
needs of various investors.
   Rather than select one or two companies to deliver the information, RTC
will probably make the raw data on properties available to all potential
publishers and let users determine which of the competing services best
meets their needs.
   American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp., a unit of Dallas-base AMR
Corp., has seized one of the first inventory-related assignments. RTC hired
the firm to process orders for the three-volume property listing, which is
priced at $50.
   Later this month, AA Direct Marketing Corp. will begin operating a 900-
number telephone line, which will allow investors to order specialized
property listings for a nominal fee that will be charged on their regular
monthly telephone bill.
   For example, a caller reaching RTC's new asset information center could
request a listing of all single-family homes in the Phoenix area, and the
order would be processed and mailed within 24 hours. The phone number has
not yet been announced.
   Would-be investors and others needing to closely scrutinize each asset
say they hope the agency eventually expands its data collection effort to
include more than just basic information on each property.
   The new report on commercial properties, for instance, provides only an
address, square footage, a one-line description, the property's age, a
contact name and - in some cases - a list price.
   Congress' requirement that the inventory be rushed into print before
Dec. 31 made it impossible for RTC to include information on all of its
holdings. Instead, the report listed only properties with clear titles that
were held by the 283 thrifts under RTC control on Sept. 30. It does not
include assets held by S&L subsidiaries, or assets of institutions placed
in the conservatorship program during the fourth quarter.

Workout Firms Eye Louisiana Portfolios

   RTC's Baton Rouge field office is looking for private-sector help in
managing and disposing of nonperforming loans and real estate left over
from the resolutions of six Louisiana conservatorships.
   "We would like to have the bid packages out this month," said Jay
Hambric, who runs the Baton Rouge operation, one of four consolidated field
offices in RTC's east region. The assignments, which could be awarded
sometime in February, will be one of the first disposition contracts handed
out since RTC opened its doors five months ago.
   Roughly $300 million in assets will be put out for bid after the agency
packages them by type, size and quality. Categories will include real
estate, real estate loans, student loans, second mortgages and other types
of consumer credits. There is also expected to be more than one quality
category, including delinquent unsecured loans.
   Packages will likely be awarded to firms with experience and expertise
in managing assets in those particular categories. RTC officials in
Washington are deciding on the fee structure for the assignment.
   RTC also retained commercial loans from the six resolutions, but Hambric
said his office would concentrate on disposing of the consumer debt first
since there was so much more of it.
   He said his office would contract separately with a firm to conduct due
diligence reviews of the assets before they are packaged.
   By the time bids are invited, RTC expects that most interested parties
will have completed the agency's newly issued registration forms. Bids will
be accepted from only those firms whose registration statements meet RTC's
criteria. RTC still hasn't decided how it will publicize the request for
proposals.
   The targeted assets were on the books of the following six Louisiana
thrifts, whose deposits were transferred to healthy institutions on the
resolution date shown in parentheses:
   * Acadia S&LA FSA of Crowley (Oct. 6). Assets: $108 million.
   * River City FSB of Baton Rouge (Oct. 6). Assets: $73 million.
   * Enterprise FS&LA of Marrero (Sept. 8). Assets: $64 million.
   * Elmwood FS&LA of Harahan (Sept. 8). Assets $58 million.
   * Evangeline FS&LA of Lafayette (Aug. 18). Assets: $37 million.
   * First Savings of Louisiana FSA of La Place (Sept. 15). Assets: $25
million.

Final Blueprint Still Lacks Specifics

   RTC's policymakers last week unveiled a strategic plan that acknowledges
key concerns of real estate and asset management professionals, but in some
ways fails to spell out precisely how the agency will address those
matters.
   Industry and government observers agreed that the three-member Oversight
Board placed the greatest emphasis on disposal of marketable assets as
quickly as possible.
   But the Board, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, was far
from specific in addressing the need for incentive-based compensation for
contractors. It said contractors could be paid "as a percentage of proceeds
net of expenses, with the percentage increasing as proceeds increase
relative to the estimated market value of assets."
   While that description acknowledges the industry's rejection of fixed
fees, it failed to state exactly whether RTC would be willing to pay base
fees - to cover a management firm's costs - in addition to performance-
based fees.
   The industry's desire to perform the asset management, or general
contractor, role in liquidations was mentioned - but not directly addressed
- in the strategic plan.
   On Capitol Hill, the document drew early applause. Rep. Bruce Vento, a
Minnesota Democrat who heads a House task force monitoring the thrift
bailout, said he was pleased with the Board's decision to quickly dispose
of the assets. "Procrastinating is much more of a risk because you have to
pay to manage [the assets]. The stuff doesn't get better with age," Vento
said in a wire service article.
   Anticipating accusations of dumping, the Board justified its pledge to
move swiftly, saying that "holding properties off the market for an
extended period of time may increase the ultimate costs of asset
disposition because of the expenses associated with managing and financing
the property." It also noted the risks of deterioration if properties are
held in RTC's portfolio for long periods.
   "It is, therefore, important to begin returning assets to the private
sector as soon as feasible," the strategic plan states.
   Oversight Board President Daniel P. Kearney attempted to silence charges
of dumping real estate on depressed markets by explaining that it would
take several years for RTC to complete the "arduous" legal process of
taking clear title to its properties and readying them for the market.
   Christopher Kallivokas, president of Real Estate Recovery Inc., an asset
management firm based in Sterling, Va., agreed that fears of property
dumping were unfounded. Kallivokas argues that the RTC for the most part
won't be delivering new properties to the market. "Virtually every property
in the RTC's inventory has been available [to buyers] for some time under
their former ownership, whether it was a former S&L or FSLIC," he said.

Two S&Ls Added to Program

   RTC closed the year by taking over two small thrifts: the $70.9 million-
asset Columbia FSA, Webster, Tex., and the $27.5 million-asset Silver SA
FA, Silver City, N.M.
   During 1989 the agency resolved 37 institutions, as shown in the
breakdown below. Another 11 were advertised for sale in November, and those
transactions should be completed shortly.

Crafting the Rescue Process

   The Oversight Board's strategic plan instructs RTC to take specific
steps to assure that it resolves failed thrift institutions quickly and
inexpensively without threatening local financial and real estate markets.
Those instructions include:
   * Limit any new lending or investments by conservatorships to low-risk
assets.
   * By Jan. 15, develop a prioritization schedule for institutions to be
marketed and resolved.
   * By Jan. 15, develop plans for soliciting bids from all interested
qualified buyers, including procedures for encouraging the participation of
women and minorities in the bidding process.
   * By Jan. 15, develop procedures for making available to all potential
bidders full information on each institution under RTC control and for
notifying rejected bidders within 30 days.
   * By March 30, establish a national sales program to coordinate the
disposition of any financial assets held in conservatorship.
   * By March 30, report to the Oversight Board on the feasibility of
hedging RTC's overall interest rate exposure.
   * By Aug. 31, report to the Oversight Board and Congress on the review
of case resolutions entered into by FSLIC between Jan. 1, 1988, and Aug. 9,
1989.

RTC Fills Key Housing Post

   RTC has named Stephen S. Allen, a veteran of the non-profit housing
community, to serve as director of the agency's low-income housing program.
   Allen takes the helm of RTC's most politically sensitive area after 13
years with the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., where he was an associate
director in charge of neighborhood preservation projects. In that position,
he directed the group's development efforts in designing model
public/private partnerships for affordable housing.
   At his new post, Allen will direct and coordinate the sale of RTC's
residential properties to eligible buyers nationwide. An RTC statement said
he and his staff plan to work closely with state housing finance agencies,
various national non-profit housing organizations and governmental
associations to identify eligible buyers.

RTC Writes a Best Seller

   If only demand was this strong for RTC's real estate...
   The company handling inquiries and orders for the agency's newly
published property listings was flooded with more than 15,000 toll-free
calls in its first two days on the job.
   Those placing orders by phone last week were told by harried operators
that they probably would not receive their books for about a month - quite
a long time considering that RTC's Oversight Board just instructed the
liquidation agency to "avoid deferring the marketing of properties."
   Some calling the 800-number that leads to the Dallas headquarters of
American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp. received the following recorded
message: "Due to the overwhelming response to the Resolution Trust Corp.
program, all of our agents are busy. Please call back later." Others were
simply asked to hold for the next available agent.
   "It's very hectic" said one weary operator, who couldn't offer an
estimate for the number of orders placed by the 15,000 callers during the
first two days.
   Copies of the inventory report may be ordered by calling (800) 431-0600.
    The reports are priced at $10 each for the commercial and land volumes,
and $15 each for the single-family and multi-family residential reports.
The complete set is available for $50. Check, credit card or C.O.D. orders
are accepted.
   The same toll-free number may also be used to inquire about locating the
reports at one of 1,400 depository libraries throughout the country.

GRAPEVINE

   RTC's Dallas staff underwent a growth spurt last week when nearly 50
employees of the defunct Federal Asset Disposition Association joined the
bailout agency's regional office. The new recruits are filling asset
management, contracting and support positions at various levels. Among
those assuming key RTC posts will be former FADA contracting staffer Janie
Thomas, who will serve as senior contracting specialist in Dallas. Many
staffers from FADA's Atlanta office have joined RTC in that city, too.
   Asset managers are hoping RTC will sharpen its definition of "competing
properties" in the agency's conflict-of-interest rules. As currently
worded, the provision could preclude a contractor from managing West Coast
apartment buildings if that firm owned "competing" apartment buildings on
the East Coast. The industry's recommended solution: RTC's conflict rules
should concern themselves only with similar properties in the same
immediate, geographic market.
   Staffers at the RTC Oversight Board are zeroing in on appointees to
chair the national advisory board and each of six regional advisory panels.
The seven, who will comprise the national board, will help select the
remaining regional advisers. After sifting through scores of nominating
letters, the staff will soon eliminate the runners up and ask the Oversight
Board to okay their selections. The seven are expected to be named within
the next month or so.
   It looks like RTC's consolidated office network in the western region
may not be operational until spring, despite what was originally a January
target. The Denver-based operation, which was initially dealt a larger sum
of thrift assets than any other region, has been slow in establishing its
three field offices slated for Denver, Phoenix and somewhere in Orange
County, Calif. By contrast, the east region has already opened its four
field offices, and begun staffing. The Baton Rouge, La. office, for
instance, already employs 55.
   Staffers in the Baton Rouge field office are trying to remove the
mystique from RTC's registration process for aspiring contractors. Agency
officials will spend the next two Monday's conducting educational seminars
for firms in Louisiana and Mississippi.
   New England's real estate lenders took another pounding in the third
quarter. Veribanc Inc., a financial statistics firm in Wakefield, Mass.,
said real estate-related loans and real estate repossessed by New England
banks increased for the thirteenth consecutive quarter. At southwest banks,
however, the situation seems to have stabilized and - by some measures -
improved. Third-quarter figures for the S&L industry are still to come.

RTC's Regional Office Network Takes Shape

   It will take a few more months for RTC to finish staffing its regional
offices, though most key management positions have already been filled at
the four locations.
   Next on the agenda is building a network of consolidated field offices,
where much of the contracting work is expected to take place. The east and
central regions have begun organizing field offices, while the southwest
and west regions have not yet announced sites or managers for their
outposts.
