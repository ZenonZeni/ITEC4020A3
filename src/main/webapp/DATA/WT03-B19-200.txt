<H2>Australia</H2>
The information technology market in Australia is worth $15 billion and is projected to grow to $20 billion by 1999.  Hardware is the largest single market sector ($4.5 billion), followed by services ($3.0 billion), data communications equipment ($2.7 billion) and software packages ($1.7 billion).  A high proportion of hardware is imported although Australia's exports are growing. Software and services generate considerable income in Australia and are expected to grow strongly.
<P>
The telecommunications industry generated carrier revenues of $15 billion in 1995.  Equipment sales to telecom operators were worth $5 billion, with much of this sourced locally.  Telecommunications services and equipment are expected to grow from $1 billion in 1995 to $3 billion by the year 2000.
<P>
Australia is increasingly recognised as a location from which to undertake manufacturing, research and development and service activities associated with the information technology and telecommunications industry.  It is a cost competitive location.
<P>
Australia is a net importer of telecom and computer equipment and services but exports have grown rapidly. Australia exports $700 million of telecom equipment and $700 million of telecom services. Computer exports are around $1800 million of computers and computer parts and $200 million of computer services.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
The information technology and telecommunications sector is likely to be one of the fastest growing sectors in Victoria and Australia throughout the 1990s.  Eight of the 12 main computer and telecommunications hardware manufacturers in Australia have production facilities in Victoria.  The IBM computer manufacturing plant at Wangaratta is the largest in Australia.  <P>
The technologies underpinning the information technology and telecommunications industries are converging and software is increasingly important to both.  Victoria has a strong base of specialist software developers and education and training facilities.  Victoria's tertiary institutions supply over one-third of Australia's annual graduates in computing and electrical/electronics engineering.
<P>
Victoria has an extensive research and development infrastructure, which underpins much of Australia's reputation in this sector.  Victorian Government established and funded bodies such as the Collaborative Information Technology Research Institute (CITRI), the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) and the Australian Computing and Communications Institute (ACCI), all located in Melbourne, have strong capabilities in advanced computing and communication technologies.  Victoria is responsible for some 70% of Australia's expenditure on telecommunications research and development , with Telstra Corporation, Australia's largest telecommunications operator, locating its 550 person research laboratories in Melbourne, where over $60 million is spent annually.  <P>
Major computing and telecommunications equipment suppliers including, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Ericsson, Nokia Telecommunications, Philips, Fujitsu, NEC and Siemens all have manufacturing and/or R&D establishments in Melbourne, where most of Australia's optical fibre is also produced.  Recent investments by Oracle Systems Australia, IBM & Olivetti will total $267 million over five years.
<P>
Victorian industry will be a significant beneficiary of the plans underway to build a state of the art broadband network to deliver a range of advanced entertainment and interactive services.  Telstra Corporation is spending $3.3 billion on network modernisation throughout Australia.  Telstra has also announced plans to spend $4.1 billion to build a hybrid fibre and coaxial cable network to deliver a range of entertainment and interactive services.  Telstra has entered into a joint venture with the News Corporation, FOXTEL, to deliver entertainment and interactive services.  FOXTEL has opened its national customer sales and service centre in Melbourne, and it will eventually employ 1000 people.  Optus Vision, a consortium of Optus Communications, Continental Cablevision Inc. and Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, has also announced plans to invest $3 billion on its cable roll-out for the delivery of entertainment and interactive services.
<P>
Victorian industry will supply all of the coaxial cable that will be used in both the Telstra and Optus Vision roll-outs and the bulk of the fibre optic cable that Telstra and Optus will require for their network upgrading and expansion.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected sales of communications services to average growth of 7 % through to 2005. Domestic production of telecom equipment and computers is also projected to increase at 7 %.  <P>
Spending on services and software is expected to continue to outpace spending on hardware in both the global and Australian markets and this trend has the potential to advantage Australian companies.
<P>

In the emerging multimedia industry, Australia and Victoria are well placed to provide content for the local and world markets for the new entertainment and interactive services offered by cable TV.
