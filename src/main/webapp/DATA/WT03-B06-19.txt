The highlights contain Economic Performance Profiles for each report that has
been fully revised this month.  Each country is rated from * (worst) to ****

based on five-year averages.
==============================================================================
BOLIVIA
Tensions are Mounting

The centrist government of President Sanchez de Lozada will face significant
cross-pressures for the remainder of its term.  The successor after the June
1997 elections is likely to be another centrist regime led by someone from
Sanchez de Lozada's National Revolutionary Movement (MNR), but a victory by a
right-wing populist remains a serious risk.  The commitment will continue to
free market policies that call for partial privatization of major state-owned
industries and the reduction of the budget deficit.  However, pressures from
labor and peasants will result in more social spending.  In addition, the large
economic role played by coca leaf dealers will inhibit the strong action
against the drug trade encouraged by the US.  This, in turn, could jeopardize
aid and financial support from the international community.  A right-wing
populist regime led by Carlos Palenque, a radio talk show host who attracts
significant support among the poor, is far from a remote possibility.  It would
raise concerns among investors about increased spending and a reversal of
market reforms.

NEW ZEALAND
National's Challenges Don't Threaten Reform

Prime Minister Jim Bolger and his National Party will have to overcome serious
obstacles in order to remain in power over the next five years.  A new
proportional voting system, which will give smaller parties a larger number of
seats in Parliament, and disarray within the National Party may result in a
coalition government led by either Labour or the Alliance Party, which is an
amalgamation of politicians who have left the two major parties.  Tensions over
immigrants and the rights of the Maori, members of the indigenous population,
could result in limited violence and also a voter backlash against the party in
power.  Despite the expected steady growth and low inflation high unemployment
will remain a problem and little improvement in living standards will be
achieved.  A coalition government led by Labour or Alliance would carry out
more fiscal expansion than would a National government, but unless the most
extreme members of the Alliance dominated policy, would not reverse most of the
market reforms that have been implemented since 1985.

ROMANIA
President Faces Tough Economic Decisions

President Ion Iliescu is favored to win the September 1996 presidential
elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a majority in Parliament.
Despite growing opposition from all sides, Iliescu will dominate the government
as he tries to move the economy toward integration with the EU.  The
privatization program under way will have limited success.  Budget cutting and
market reforms will be implemented enough to qualify for assistance from the
IMF and the EU but not enough to greatly improve the business climate.
However, the economy is expected to grow over the next five years, and
inflation will be brought into more tolerable ranges.

SINGAPORE
Goh to Continue

Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is building support for his leadership of the
ruling People's Action Party (PAP), although former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
remains in a strong position.  Elections that need to be held by August 1996
are likely to result in nothing more than a slight decline in electoral support
for PAP.   The government will manage the economy and will permit some trade
liberalization.  The biggest source of political uncertainty is the successor
to Prime Minister Goh.  The front-runner, Lee Hsien Loong, who is Lee Kuan
Yew's son, suffers from serious health problems.  If he were to become
incapacitated, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan Keng Yam would replace Goh if
there were a transition. The biggest challenge to international business will
continue to be the shortage of labor and the strong position of the Singapore
currency.  Nevertheless, inflation will remain under 4%.

SPAIN
New Government Won't Improve the Economy

Elections in March 1996 are likely to result in a center-right government
headed by Jose Maria Aznar and his Popular Party (PP), depending on support of
one or both of the major regional parties, the Catalonian Convergence and Union
(CiU) and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).  It is possible, but not likely,
that the Socialists could gain the support of these two parties and retain
enough electoral support to head a coalition government.  This likelihood would
increase if someone other than Prime Minister Gonzalez were to lead the party,
and in the process create a united effort.  However, the Socialist Workers
Party (PSOE), which suffers from its long period of rule and several scandals,
is split.  Economic policies are not likely to differ under either government,
as Spain continues to be guided by EU regulations that require liberalization.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
Stability, but Limited Opportunity

The stable federal structure is buttressed by the support of the two dominant
component emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  The federal government will continue
to be led by President Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; the prime
ministership will be held by Sheik Maktum bin Rashid al-Maktum, the current
ruler of Dubai.  If either leader leaves office for reasons of health, he will
be replaced by a younger member of the respective family.  The pressure for
democratic reform is weak.  Islamic fundamentalism will not seriously threaten
the government.  The economy will remain heavily dependent on oil, despite
attempts at diversification.  As a result, growth will be modest, at best, and
inflation will show some upward movement.  Opportunities for foreign business
are expected to be limited, despite some modest attempts to attract foreign
investment through liberalization.

UNITED STATES
No End to Divided Government

The struggle between President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress will almost certainly thwart significant budgetary reform, leading to
economic drift.  The November 1996 presidential and congressional elections are
not likely to affect policy direction, even if the Republican challenger,
probably Sen. Robert Dole, wins the presidency.  The most likely result of the
elections will be a slim victory for Clinton, and Republican control of
Congress.  Popular sentiment for protectionist measures will increase, but is
not likely to be translated into policy.

VENEZUELA
No Improvement in Sight

Sluggish economic growth, high inflation, political vacillation, and outbreaks
of turmoil will assure a bleak climate for international business at least
until the presidential election of 1998.  Even then, the climate will suffer
from underlying structural problems, notably an overdependence on oil exports
and a lack of fiscal discipline.  Poor conditions are aggravated by the
populist stance of President Rafael Caldera Rodriguez.  Caldera will implement
limited austerity measures, but only under pressure from the IMF.  In addition
to his own ideologically-based distaste for such measures, he will be hampered
by opposition in Congress.  He faces an increased risk of political violence or
even a military coup if he accepts the IMF conditions.  Support for leftist
parties, especially Causa R (whose candidate for president, Andres Velasquez,
finished second in 1993), could produce a center-left government in 1998.
Despite its leftist orientation, such a government could implement more
systematic economic reforms than Caldera.  No matter who becomes president,
however, all businesses will suffer from the lack of government legitimacy and
the persistent conflict between the president and Congress.

BRIEF UPDATES TO COUNTRY FORECASTS


BURMA
Glacier-Like Reform

Despite an announced privatization policy and a constitutional convention that
started at the end of November 1995, the military junta is inclined to permit
only the most limited reform.  The military leaders have made it clear that the
constitution must give the military a major role in the new government.  In
response, the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) has threatened to
walk out of the convention.  The NLD is not likely to back down.  More than 80%
of the delegates are appointed by the government, and whatever legislative body
is called for by the constitution will have a large number of delegates
appointed by the military.  Although the government has indicated that it plans
to privatize 51 state-owned companies, only six have been sold.  The government
has put further privatization on hold until a stock exchange is established.
Some of the privatization may include sale of stock to the public, but the
government will maintain control over management.  As a result, investors face
political tension over democratic reforms coming from the US and a government
that will not give up significant control over economic decisions.

CHINA
Business Climate Threatened

Against the background of uncertainty regarding the role of leaders as Deng
Xiaoping's death nears, concern over the future business climate grows.  Jiang
Zemin is consolidating his grip on power but he may actually be merely the
puppet of a small group of top leaders.  There is a clear commitment to foreign
investment and some forms of private enterprise.  However, the struggle between
the regions and the central government is heightened by the weakness in the
center.  State enterprises may be in retreat but they are not likely to close
down because the leadership is worried about the social consequences of
unemployment.  Some discussion has begun within government circles of removing
tax on breaks given to foreign investors to compensate in part for a reduction
in tariffs required for membership in the WTO. This has caused concern within
international business.  Another worry arises from the growing importance and
aggressiveness of the Chinese military, especially in the South China Sea.  In
addition, tensions with Taiwan may increase.  Pressure from the US government
over human rights issues, the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, and trade policy
have already set off a nationalistic response that eventually could threaten
businesses operating in China, including the withdrawal of MFN status by the
US.  As a result, the strong international payments balance may suffer a
decline.

ECUADOR
Investors Worry for Good Reason

Political and economic uncertainties will likely deter investors over the next
year.  President Sixto Duran Ballen is growing increasingly unpopular, because
of a scandal and because of a sluggish economy.  He also faces a badly divided
and hostile congress.  There is little prospect that enough economic reforms
will be implemented to stimulate the economy.  Consequently, the elections in
May 1996 are not likely to result in a regime any more capable of improving the
economy than the current government.  The economy is at risk, because of
increased violence and the threat of a military coup.

EGYPT
Mubarak Consolidates

President Hosni Mubarak has assured his control over the next five years.  He
has cracked down on fundamentalists and in November 1995 engineered a
parliamentary election that increased support for his government. His
willingness to use force, mixed with occasional and limited political
liberalization, has kept the opposition off balance.  He is assured of US
financial help by his support of the Arab-Israeli peace process, although he
manages to postpone implementing the structural economic reforms called for by
the international financial community.  Some progress has been made in reducing
the foreign debt, controlling inflation, and stimulating economic growth.
However, the systematic privatizations that are essemtial to improving
prospects over the long term has yet to develop.  Because of fear that layoffs,
resulting from privatization, could substantially increase social unrest, the
prospects are not good for genuine reform.

IRAN
Weakening Economy

Lacking any consensus on the need for market reforms, and little chance of a
substantial increase in the price of oil, the economy shows no signs of
improving, and inflation continues to be a danger.  President Akbar Hasemi
Rafsanjani has tried to add his supporters to the government, but the more
radical fundamentalists continue to block both market reforms and accommodation
with non-Islamic foreign interests.  At the same time, the US government shows
no signs whatsoever of normalizing economic relations.

OMAN
Dealing With Lower Oil Revenues

Although in firm control, Sultan Qaboos faces serious obstacles in reducing the
country's debt.  The key problem is that the economy depends on oil revenues
which are flat.  The need to develop non-oil exports has been met in part but
not enough to make a palpable difference.  Remittances by foreign workers in
Oman is also a problem that the government will try, probably unsuccessfully,
to address by replacing these workers with Omani nationals.  Qaboos has given
the Consultative Council more visibility, but will resist sharing of power.
Some steps have been promised to increase foreign investment but they have yet
to have much of an impact.

PERU
Fujimori in Firm Control

Despite the defeat of many of the candidates he backed in mid-November 1995
local elections, President Alberto Fujimori shows no signs of losing control.
He stands high in public opinion polls and is not backing down from his
authoritarian rule.  The economy is relatively healthy by South American
standards and significant progress has been made in reducing the huge
international debt that existed when Fujimori first came to power.  Since
Fujimori will be in control until mid-2000, the biggest source of long-term
uncertainty remains the lack of a successor if he were to be assassinated or
leave office for reasons of health.

RUSSIA
Parliamentary Elections Confirm Tensions

The December 1995 parliamentary elections affirmed the chaotic condition of the
political system.  Although the Communist Party received twice as many votes as
the Liberal Democratic party of nationalist extremist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, its
victory was more a result of superior political organization than a yearning
for a return to the Communist system.  Moderates and those in favor of reform
held their own.  Because of the weakness of the Duma in relation to the
presidency, the results will have little direct impact on policy before the
presidential election in June 1996.  The results also suggest that Yeltsin may
have trouble being re-elected if the Communists can unify behind their leader,
Gennadi Zyuganov.  Over the long run, there is little prospect that a
government will emerge that will make significant reforms in the large
state-controlled industries, but most of the market reforms will not be
reversed.  The two biggest sources of risk to the business climate are the lack
of a strong legal framework supporting business operations limiting arbitrary
interventions by the various government bodies and the emergence of a
nationalistic foreign policy that would threaten help from the international
financial community.

SAUDI ARABIA
Isolated Incident no Cause for Concern

The November 1995 bombing of a building in Riyadh used by Americans to train
the Saudi military appears to have been an isolated incident directed more at
the US than at the Saudi government. However, tension remains over both the
presence of US forces in the kingdom and erosion of traditional Muslim values.
There are, nevertheless, no signs that the current government is seriously
threatened.  While the economy remains heavily influenced by oil prices and
levels of production, there has been some diversification.  There has also been
some belt-tightening which has yet to generate significant dissatisfaction with
the government.

TAIWAN
Elections Weaken Ruling Party

Although the ruling Nationalist party won 85 out of 164 seats in the
parliament, it received 45% of the vote, the lowest percentage since 1945.
This resulted in the loss of seven seats.  The biggest winner was the New Party
which gained 21 seats.  Running on a platform of accommodation with China, the
New Party consists primarily of former Nationalist Party (KMT) officials who
left, in part, because of disagreement over the government's apparent move to
an independence position with respect to China.  However, New Party voters were
nearly all mainlanders which, if continued, will limit the party's future vote.
President Lee Teng-hui will encounter more difficulty in implementing new
policy initiatives.  Because the economy is showing the effects of high labor
costs and the tendency of the Taiwanese to invest in China and elsewhere, the
government will be faced with growing electoral dissatisfaction.  President
Lee, however, still enjoys approval ratings in the 70% range.  This makes him a
favorite in the March 1996 presidential election.  If he wins a clear mandate,
he may promote constitutional changes to increase Taiwanese influence in the
government.

ZAMBIA
Chiluba Becomes More Authoritarian

After benefiting from pressures to democratize the political system, President
Frederick Chiluba has chosen his own political survival over democratic
processes.  Because elections are scheduled for October 1996, and because of
the growing political strength of former President Kenneth Kaunda, Chiluba has
tried to eliminate Kaunda over legal technicalities concerning whether or not
the former president is in fact a citizen of Zambia.  Kaunda was arrested twice
in 1995 for failing to receive proper authorization for public speeches.
Chiluba's political problems stem from his inability to revive the economy
despite initial market reforms.  A Kaunda government would likely halt or even
reverse the reforms.

For each country, Political Risk Services monitors and forecasts the key
economic indicators of real GDP growth and inflation (expressed as %),
as well as current account balance (expressed as a surplus "+" or
deficit "-" in US$ billions).  The 1st line shows the average for the
most recent five-year period, the second line gives a forecast or
estimate for a one-year period, and the third line provides the
five-year forecast.  Our staff constantly monitors economic conditions
for 100 countries.
