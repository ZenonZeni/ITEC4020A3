<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Department of Conservation Planning and Technical Cooperation (CPTC) focuses on two of Conservation International's strategic objectives: the use of science to direct our conservation actions and the development of local institutional capacity in the developing world. We fulfill our mission by finding solutions to critical limiting factors, problems common to many of our local partners, but problems that small local organizations may not have the means to solve on their own. <P>
Throughout the world, particularly in the species-rich tropics, institutions working to protect biodiversity face similar problems as well as obstacles to solving them.  Likewise. the best solutions to local challenges often turn out to be universal.  As an organization working in virtually all of earth's tropical rain forest hotspots -- in addition to many other biologically rich habitats -- CI is an ideal vehicle for developing and widely disseminating successful approaches to biodiversity conservation.<P>

One of the biggest barriers to effective conservation everywhere is lack of basic information about ecosystems, a prerequisite to all rational planning and environmental decision-making.  Through Regional Conservation Assesmments, CPTC solves this problem by bringing together the best expertise and technology to produce a comprehensive analysis of a region's conservation status.  Once priorities are established, methods must be developed for planning and facilitating appropriate conservation action. Science is at the heart of finding these answers.

<H3>Regional Conservation Analysis and Priority Setting Workshops</H3>
<P>CI's <A HREF="../../../science/cptc/consprio/!run_me!.htm">Conservation Priority Setting Workshops and Regional Conservation Analyses</A> bring together leaders in science, government, and non-governmental sectors to set regional and national conservation priorities. The workshops create a consensus-based framework for conservation action.   Our goals are to: 
 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>organize and convene conservation priority consensus-building projects in all of the world's rain forest "hotspot" regions; 

<LI>integrate global-scale conservation priority data for the major tropical regions: Latin America, Asia/Pacific, and Africa; and,

<LI>recommend and promote policy changes within the next five years to ensure the sustainable use of biodiversity. 
</UL>

<p><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/africa/Baobob.jpg" ALT="Baobob" WIDTH=254 HEIGHT=168 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>Since 1990, CI has held a number of Priority Setting Workshops, including those in the Amazon Basin, Brazil, Papua New Guinea, ,  Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and Madagascar.  During the upcoming year, workshops will be held in Indonesia's Irian Jaya, the Sea of Cortez, Mexico, and the Cerrado, Brazil.  Regional Conservation Assessments have been held to evaluate the conservation status of the Maya Forest Region (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize), to assess biodiversity needs in Guyana, and evaluate infrastructure development throughout the Andes (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia).

<H3> Capacity Building in Science and Technology</H3>


<P>
CI also runs programs to develop scientific skills and the capacity for conservation planning with people living in the world's "hotspots."  <A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/training/cap.htm">Local capacity-building</A> reduces the dependence of partnership organizations on CI, while increasing the impact of regional organizations in supporting the technical needs of the region. CI provides training and technical support to local institutions and field programs that have limited expertise and access to technology, and facilitates the exchange of information and experience among non-U.S. institutions concerned with resource management.  CI also seeks to make key biodiversity maps and databases available at the field level to support science-based conservation, research and training activities, and improve CI's outreach.

<STRONG>Training Workshops in Science and Technology</STRONG><BR>
Over the past three years, Conservation International has sponsored 36 training workshops in 17 countries.  More than 280 people from NGOs, academic institutions, and government agencies have participated in these workshops, held in both rural and urban areas.  Each two- to three-week workshop provides intensive instruction and practice in the use of geographic information systems, GPS, image classification, database development, and Internet access and data exchange.  The program has been successful in establishing two regional training centers in Brazil and Peru that have conducted six workshops of their own.<P>

<A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/unesco/overview.htm">CI-UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Capacity-building Project  </A><BR>This year we began a new initiative that will help us further develop the outreach of this program.  In collaboration with UNESCO, CI will provide training and technical support in GIS analysis, database development, and communications to 25 biosphere reserves in the world's hotspots. <P>

<p><dd><b>SIGNATURA Network</b><BR>

The SIGNATURA Network utilizes e-mail, a newsletter, regional thematic workshops, and occasional conferences to spread informationan about GIS.  Members of the network are encouraged to publish articles about their own experiences in environmental planning, discussing both the practical applications of GIS analysis and the operational aspects of developing a GIS database.  The network's newsletter, <A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/network/sigtop.htm"> <i>SIGNATURA</i></A>, is published in both Spanish and Portuguese, and has more than 1000 subscribers. <P>
<B>CISIG Development Program</b><BR>
<A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/training/cisigbro.htm"> CISIG</A> (CI's Geographic Information System) is a computer tool that integrates and displays maps showing biological, social, and economic data for conservation analysis.  It is available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.  Also available is PRISMA, a database publishing and distribution tool for distributing GIS databases on CD-ROM.
