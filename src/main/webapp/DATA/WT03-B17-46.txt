A frequent issue that prompts students to venture up to 310 Briggs is depression.  Students might not initially label what's wrong as depression, but they frequently are citing symptoms of depression:  lack of motivation, fatigue, insomnia (not due to all night studying!), withdrawal from friends, underlying sense of anger, etc.  Mild depression is our most common emotional disturbance.  Serious depression affects 1 in 5 people at some time in their lives.<p>
Depression is often misunderstood.  We tell ourselves, or others tell us, to perk up and "get over it."  When we minimize our feelings, we suffer.  We are not validating who we are, and we are disrupting others' lives when we can't work as well as normal or participate in social or relationship activities.<p>
There are different degrees of severity of depression:
<DL>
<DT>Mild depression
<DD>is the most common type of depression.  It's usually brief and doesn't seriously 	interfere with normal activities.  Significant events such as holidays, graduation, schedule 	changes, or boredom can result in a temporary "down" mood.  Treatment is not usually needed for mild depression; a change of situation and time are generally enough to lift the blues.
<DT>Moderate depression
<DD>is similar to mild depression, but the symptoms are more intense and last for a longer period of time.  The death of a loved one, a career setback, or similar unhappy events can trigger a moderate depressive episode.  In this situation we are aware that we are unhappy, but we usually can't stop the feelings.  We might have a little more trouble keeping up with daily activities; we might be considering suicide to ease the pain.  Professional help might be necessary to work through moderate depression.
<DT>Severe depression
<DD>is sometimes referred to as a separation from reality.  Loss of interest in the 	outside world and serious prolonged behavior changes are characteristic.  Neurological imbalances 	are one cause of severe depression.  Also, alcoholism or drug addiction can be related to severe 	depression.  Suicide is a high risk for severe depression.  Manic-depression is a form of depression in 	which we go from extreme good moods to extreme low moods.  Professional treatment is necessary to help severely depressed individuals.</DL>

Some types of depression run in families, indicating that a biological vulnerability can be inherited.  This seems to be the case with bipolar disorders.  Studies of families, in which members of each generation develop bipolar disorder, found that those with the illness have a somewhat different genetic makeup than those who do not get ill.  However, the reverse is not true:  Not everybody with the genetic makeup that causes vulnerability to bipolar disorder has the illness.  Apparently additional factors, possibly a stressful environment, are involved in its onset.<p>
Major depression also seems to occur generation after generation, in some families.  However, it can also occur in people who have no family history of depression.  Whether inherited or not, major depression disorder is often associated with having too little or too much of certain neurochemicals.<p>
Psychological makeup also plays a role in vulnerability to depression.  People who have low self-esteem, who are readily overwhelmed by stress are prone to depression.<p>
A serious loss, chronic illness, difficult relationship, financial problems, or any unwelcome change in life patterns can also trigger a depressive episode.  Very often, a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors is involved in the onset of a depressive disorder.<p>

Depressive disorder make you feel exhausted, worthless, helpless, and hopeless.  Such negative thoughts and feelings make some of us feel like giving up.  It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depression and typically do not accurately reflect you situation.  Negative thinking fades as treatment begins to take effect.  Talking with a trusted person, a professional such as a counselor or psychologist, or a clergy member is one means of treatment for depression.  Sometimes medication such as anti-depressants are needed to treat depression.  When medications are used, psychotherapy is often recommended as a co-treatment;  medication can only do so much, learning how to help yourself is also important.  Some things that you can do for yourself include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Do not set yourself difficult goals or take on a great deal of responsibility.
<li>Break large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can as you can.
<li>Do not expect too much from yourself too soon as this will only increase feelings of failure.
<li>Try to be with other people; it is usually better than being alone.
<li>Participate in activities (other than substance use or abuse) that may make you feel better.
<li>You might try mild exercise, going to a movie, a ballgame, or participating in religious or social activities.
<li>Do not expect to snap out of your depression.  People rarely do.  Help yourself as much as you can, and do not blame yourself for not being up to par.
