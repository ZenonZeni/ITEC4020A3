FORCE C SKIN CREAM

The Skin Cream that was reported from the United Kingdom in the 11/1/95
issue of this publication is now being rolled-out in France.  Called Force
C and marketed by Helena Rubinstein, the cream is rich in vitamin C, making
it unique among other skin care creams.  Because vitamin C breaks down when
in contact with other ingredients in skin care products, manufacturers have
been unable to supply consumers with a way to supply their skin with the
beneficial properties of vitamin C. This presentation, however, changes
that.  Each bottle of Force C contains an upper compartment of pure vitamin
C that, when dispensed, mixes with and melts into the emulsion housed
below. One bottle contains sufficient ingredients for ten days.  A pack
containing four bottles is priced at 285,00 F.  CATEGORY: Health & Beauty
