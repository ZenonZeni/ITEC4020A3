<h3>Caroline Kennedy<br>
Addresses Women’s Luncheon</h3>
NEW YORK, NY  -- Caroline Kennedy addressed a record-breaking gathering of NDSS supporters during the annual Women’s Luncheon last spring. 
<p>
After a colorful introduction by NDSS Board member Anna Quindlen, Ms. Kennedy spoke about the great strides that have been made in recent years by people with developmental disabilities.
<p> 
Drawing from her family’s long-time support of programs such as the Special Olympics, and legislation to provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities, Ms Kennedy stressed the need to include people with developmental disabilities in all aspects of community life. 
Kim Simons, 21, of Chappaqua, NY, presented Ms. Kennedy with a token of appreciation, and spoke about her experiences growing up with Down syndrome. 
<p> 
The National Down Syndrome Society is grateful for the dedication of the Women’s Luncheon Committee, whose efforts made the luncheon the most successful in NDSS’s history. Special thanks go to the committee chairperson, Debra Martindale Goll, under whose guidance the event made a smooth transition to its new venue, The Plaza Hotel.
<p> 
Plans are underway for the 1997 Women’s Luncheon, to be held this spring in The Plaza Hotel in New York, NY. If you are interested in attending, becoming a member of the organizing committee, or opportunities for corporate sponsorship, please call 1-800-221-4602.

<h3>National Drama Features Down Syndrome Storyline - </h3>
The popular daytime drama <i>Guiding Light</i> is doing its part to raise awareness and acceptance of individuals with special needs, through a ground-breaking new storyline about a child with Down syndrome. While network television has depicted characters with this condition, this is the first time a series has explored the issues faced by parents before and immediately after a child is born. 
<p>
As <i>Guiding Light</i> intends to develop this storyline as accurately and dramatically as possible, with guidance and fact-checking provided by the National Down Syndrome Society, all people with Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities can benefit from a greater understanding fostered by this program.
<p>
The storyline has emerged with the birth of "Meg" born to soap characters Fletcher Reade and Holly Lindsey-Reade (played by Jay Hammer and Maureen Garrett). Meg, who is played by Jacqueline Falchier of Maplewood, NJ, (born September 1995), has Down syndrome and was cast with assistance from the National Down Syndrome Society.
<p>  
"We’re thrilled with <i>Guiding Light’s</i> programming decision to feature a child with Down syndrome, and their willingness to work with us in creating such a responsible depiction of a family’s experiences, explained Myra E. Madnick, executive director of NDSS. "Baby Jacqueline doesn’t realize it yet, but she’s going to help teach millions of people that children with Down syndrome have many wonderful abilities and talents. She’ll be instrumental in changing attitudes and increasing acceptance. She’s the youngest advocate we have."
<p> 
Baby Jacqueline and the National Down Syndrome Society’s role in the story line were also the topic of a CBS <i>Day&Date</i> story (July 12, 1996), which applauded the programming decision.
<p>
Future <i>Guiding Light</i> story lines will include the types of situations a baby with Down syndrome and his or her parents encounter. The National Down Syndrome Society has recently provided the <i>Guiding Light</i> writers with information about early intervention programs that assist infants with Down syndrome in the areas of language, muscle development and fine motor skills.

<h3>Siblings’ Relationship<br>
Explored through Performance</h3>

Two brothers from Israel recently toured the United States, performing their touching play about one brother’s Down syndrome and its affect on their relationship.
<p> 
Ofer Shikartsi, 35, and Dekel Shikartsi, 21, have performed <i>On the Other Side of the House</i>, more than 500 times in Israel, and have teamed up with the very competent Janet Neeman, who offers consecutive Hebrew translation for English-speaking audiences.
<p>
In a sensitive, gentle and often humorous manner, the play offers insight into the life of Dekel, who has Down syndrome. Dekel also presents a sampling of his original poetry, including his biographical, <i>An Angel with Down Syndrome</i>. Following the performance, the actors are available for candid discussions with the audience. The Shikartsi brothers have tentatively scheduled another United States visit for this winter.
<p>
For information about scheduling a performance for your organization, please call Renee Schreiber, Director of Cultural Events for the Consulate General of Israel in New York, at (212) 499-5442.
