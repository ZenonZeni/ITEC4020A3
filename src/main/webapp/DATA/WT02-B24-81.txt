<p><b>Barbara Cordoni, Ed.D.</b>

<p>A local Learning Disabilities Association meeting had as its speakers a 
group of successful college students with learning disabilities who were 
answering questions asked by the middle and high school students in the 
audience. This meeting represented the first time the adolescent students 
with learning disabilities had ever had the opportunity to really interact 
with others who had gone through what they were going through.

<p>Both the older college students and the younger students had their stories. 
Some of the stories they related were enough to break every heart in the room. 
Some students reported good attempts by teachers to help them but one reported 
"being placed in a waste basket because that was all she was worth." They 
nodded their heads. These young people understood each other.

<p>As a listener at this meeting, I learned from the students, as is often 
the case. A lovely thirteen year old looked directly at my daughter, Tara, a 
member of the panel, and asked, "How many 'A's' are enough?" While I was 
still pondering the question, my daughter answered, "I don't know. I don't 
know how many A's you have to get before you feel worthwhile, before you feel
as competent as others; before you stop worrying that they will find you out."
As Tara spoke, I remembered that it was not until she had her master's degree 
in her hand that she had allowed herself to believe it was truly hers.

<p>Even though parents may learn a great deal from meetings such as these, it 
is difficult for us to hear of the painful experiences of our children. It can 
also be difficult to hear students reveal to their understanding peers things
they felt they couldn't discuss with their parents. When we, horrified, find 
out years later some of the things that happened to them, they tell us they 
couldn't talk about them, it simply hurt too much.
<br>

<h3>LIVING WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES</h3>
<p>The way families handle interactions such as these or those with school 
personnel depends on several factors: the mental health of the family; how 
badly and how often the child is wounded; the quality of help and support 
they receive from family, friends and the school district; and their own 
personalities. Obviously, families are different. Some are intact, but feel 
that educating children is the school's job and if the school did a better 
job many problems would be avoided.

<p>Some parents are fearful of confronting a teacher, fearing the teacher may 
retaliate and their child may receive fewer services. Some families are 
headed by single parents, who have to work long hours just to feed the 
children, leaving little time for parent involvement with the school. The 
structure of the family is far less important than the family's support of 
the person with learning disabilities. Acceptance of the person as a valued 
human being is the key to good mental health.

<p>In order to understand the family dynamics more comprehensively than one 
person's experience allows, the author spoke at length with a number of the 
Achieve Program's students.

<p>The Achieve Program is an academic support system for students with 
learning disabilities at Southern Illinois University. For seventeen years, 
these students have come from all over the United States and from thirteen 
foreign countries in order to go to college with the support of this
program. The author felt that a broad spectrum of experiences from
students from across the land would allow a better understanding of the
adolescent years as experienced by our children. As expected, their
experiences were varied. Some who came from very supportive homes, or who
were sports stars, or who went to private schools where their learning
disabilities were understood, came through those teenage years reasonably
intact psychologically. None was left without wounds.

<p>Students who came from homes where the learning disability was a source of 
embarrassment for the parents or where the parents didn't understand, had 
serious questions about their own self worth. Students who came from schools 
where the school district routinely restricted their classes and the makeup 
of those classes, showed a greater degree of stress than those from more 
supportive schools. All agreed that multicategorical placements produced the 
poorest results. Students who had been in classes with severely acting out 
students or who were mentally retarded rarely received appropriate services. 
The resource room in such schools represented the place where the "dummies 
go." This was a painful experience and memories continue to be painful.

<p>None understood the nature of his/her disabilities.

<p>Many said they were told that they were smart but had trouble learning. 
Others were given a label, such as dyslexia, which really had little meaning 
to them. The students perceived themselves as "not trying very hard"; not too 
bright; and outsiders in that critical group of successful high school
students. They felt lonely and were embarrassed over their inadequacies and 
because of having to spend time in the resource room.

<p>Teenage years are difficult at best; however, having a learning disability 
only makes this period more difficult. Adolescents want desperately to be 
liked by their peers, but may feel isolated because of their disability. 
Parents may continue to offer support by telling the child how smart they 
are but the child may not believe it. The feeling is: "They're my parents, 
they have to say it."
<br>

<h3>SCHOOL EXPERIENCES</h3>
<p>The Achieve students handled the trauma of high school in different ways. 
One took a full time job and went to school only occasionally. His single 
mother worked nights and could not be around for him. During one period he 
missed 45 days of school. Apparently, the school either was unaware or 
unconcerned. Another enrolled in as few academic classes as possible, taking 
several PE classes a semester and perhaps one history class. He arranged his 
study halls for the end of the day which meant he could leave school at noon.
His last math class was in 8th grade. The friends he made at his Catholic 
grade school were the ones he kept. He says he went back to his ten year high
school reunion and didn't   know anyone.

<p>As these stories are relayed, one wonders, "Where were the guidance 
counselors, the special education teachers, the truant officers?"

<h3>BEHAVIORS</h3>
<p>Others say they hid behind a mask of toughness - black leather jackets; a 
knife in your backpack; promiscuity; alcohol and drugs - defying anyone to get
close. Some shoplifted, hot-wired cars, ran away and dated unsuitable people. 
Many, of course, dropped out of school.

<p>When parents see these kinds of behaviors emerging, they may not know what 
to do. Most try to talk to the youngster, (which often evolves into a 
screaming match) but unless a strong family bond has been set up long ago, 
talking probably will not be very effective. Even if there was a strong bond 
established, it is very difficult for the young person to open up to a parent 
about issues he is convinced the parent will not understand. With a limited 
peer group, the young person is unlikely to ask their advice, certainly not 
as it pertains to a disability. Often, the only group that willingly accepts 
these students is the dropout prone, substance abusing group. Since everybody 
has a basic need to be accepted by someone, this group is often where the LD 
youngsters can be found and the worse they behave, the more accepted they are.

<p>Such behaviors are terrifying to parents who are frightened about where 
the behaviors may lead. This beloved child is rebelling against everything 
his parents have tried to teach him, willfully, it may seem.

<p>Constant worry and stress (will s/he come home tonight?) affects every 
family member.

<p>Siblings may resent the attention focused on the acting out child, in 
effect saying, "I behave and where is the attention I deserve?" Some strive 
even harder to "make up" for the dysfunctional child. At school they may be 
ashamed of, or embarrassed by the sibling. Parents may not agree on the steps 
to help this child, causing friction between them. Repeated trips to yet 
another specialist may result in financial stress.

<p>Therapeutic intervention with a psychologist or social worker seems the 
next step to take, but often the adolescent cannot be made to go. If the 
parent succeeds in getting the child into the building to meet the therapist, 
the adolescent may be so resistant to treatment that there is no point in 
pursuing it. Many Achieve students have been through therapy, or their 
parents have attempted therapy. They felt that the best approach is to find 
an LD adult to work with the student in a non-threatening environment. Very 
few therapists have been trained to work with and understand the needs of the 
person with a learning disability and such knowledge is critical to 
successful intervention.

<p>Another response of the LD adolescent is to become the "people pleaser" in 
an attempt to have some control over what is happening to him/her. This child 
appears less rebellious and is less frightening to parents. This child has 
learned to be a charmer, often a skillful manipulator, who can talk others 
into just about anything; who never takes no for an answer; who will later 
come back with another reason why s/he should be allowed to do it his/her way.
They tend to do better in school because teachers hesitate to fail these 
pleasant people who always have a smile. They can be maddening to live with. 
The pleasantness at school often disappears at home where it is less useful, 
but the manipulative behavior remains. Here, again, family dynamics come into 
play as they learn how to lead without destroying what, to the child, has 
become a survival skill.

<p>Parents need to remember that adolescents may be frightened and are doing 
the best they can to cope. They have little faith in their own abilities; they
feel that they are less adequate than their peers; and they are constantly 
afraid their inadequacies will be discovered.

<p>Sometimes a youngster just quits. A mother and father came to see me, 
dragging along their fifteen year old son. He sat down hard on the couch and 
glared at me as his parents told me his story. He had been seen by some fine 
specialists but his parents said that the school had never followed through 
on the specialists' suggestions. He was impulsive and distractible. He had a 
language disorder which did not allow him to formulate a sentence; rather he 
would talk all around a topic until people refused to listen. Having tried 
everything they knew to help their child, now they were very frightened. The 
school was threatening to send him away to a school for the emotionally 
disturbed; the last time the school psychologist had tried to test him he had 
refused to answer any questions. I turned to the child and laughed, much to 
the parents amazement. "Decided you weren't going to play his silly games 
anymore, didn't you?" He looked at me, startled, and said: "Yes!" I then said 
to the boy, "You felt it hadn't done you any good in the past so why go
through it again, right?" to which he replied, "Right!"

<p>His parents were stunned to find the reason for his refusal to submit to 
more testing. Often a child will so entrench himself in a position that only 
a person outside the family can be more objective and get at the heart of the 
matter. Why should he try to explain to his parents? After all, they had 
allowed this to happen to him again; they were no help in his eyes.

<p>They went on to tell me of his many talents while he rebuffed each talent 
they mentioned. Finally I turned to him and said: "You think that if you can 
do it, it must be awfully easy and everybody else can do it too, don't you?" 
He looked surprised when I told him that not everyone would be able to do the 
same things he could do, but that he would have to learn that himself.

<p>It was agreed that he would be placed in an alternative school that a very 
good special education director had opened. This placement was basically a 
self-contained LD class, which proved to be a lifesaver for this child.

<p>The nurses in the newborn nursery as well as mothers can tell early on the 
type of personality a baby is likely to develop. Some babies seem ready to 
take on the world while others lie quietly, hardly making a sound. These 
inborn personality variables, especially in the child with learning 
disabilities, are obviously affected by the way a child is raised. As the 
quiet baby grows he or she is easy to get along with but tends to be a more 
fearful child, less ready to be the first in line or to raise a fuss. This is 
the child who allows the parent - indeed almost forces the parent - to do a 
great deal for him/her. From homework to the ironing, these children appear 
helpless and if this behavior is allowed to continue, they will be. In 
adolescence, many become depressed.
<br>

<h3>DEPRESSION</h3>
<p>Adolescent depression can be very frightening. It is difficult for a parent to judge how severe the depression is and to know when to call for professional help.

<p>Some signs of clinical depression are: a lack of interest in things s/he 
was interested in before; a change in eating habits, either bingeing or 
rejection of food which can lead to bulimia or anorexia; lack of interest in 
personal appearances and/or personal hygiene; excessive sleeping; a lack of 
involvement in family matters; promiscuity; drug use; and truancy. While each 
of these behaviors can have other causes, it is very important for the parent 
to watch for them and to take action if necessary. Action may include those 
mentioned before such as talking to a social worker, psychologist, or another 
adult with learning disabilities. Medication, if indicated, must be monitored 
by a physician. If the adolescent refuses to consult a professional, then 
the parent must do so. Depression is too dangerous to just hope it will 
disappear. One of my students told me he was in third grade the first time he 
tried to commit suicide. All children can become depressed under certain 
circumstances, but it is not sustained. It goes away after a few days or a 
week and should not be of great concern. If the depression is constant or 
becomes more severe, seek professional help. Once again, a major secret to 
good mental health is to feel good about yourself.
<br>

<h3>INDEPENDENCE</h3>
<p>We parents help in the early school years because we must. The child with 
learning disabilities is under 	such stress to get the homework done that we 
are unwilling to place additional burdens, so the unkempt room is allowed for 
one more day or the chores left undone. It is also easier to do the chores 
ourselves than to get the child to do what s/he is supposed to do.

<p>Like water, taking the path of least resistance, the child learns to be 
helpless, and the parent feels needed. This isn't so bad while the child is 
young, but upon reaching adolescence most people want some control over at 
least a portion of their lives. Parents. unaccustomed to this behavior, may 
not willingly relinquish control. By this time, parents have been fighting 
for this child for a long time and may distrust other's promises. Even in the 
Achieve Program we have parents who call often, making sure that their child 
is getting the needed help. The students resent it. A young man lost his 
backpack the other day and since it contained some expensive equipment, he 
called his folks to tell them. His dad immediately called to ask for help for 
his son. Because we keep copies of their notes from classes and could help in 
replacing some of the lost material, I called the young man, who exploded, 
saying, "Can't they ever let me take care of anything myself!"

<p>A student, twenty years of age, requested a counseling session for her 
parents. She did not want to have to call her mother every day. She wanted to 
be allowed to make some decisions on her own. It was explained to her that if 
she wanted that freedom, she had to accept responsibility as well. She had to 
do her own work and not ask for her parents' help in writing every paper, 
ironing her clothes, and solving her problems. She understood that and was 
really trying to become her own person. This was discussed with her parents, 
concluding that we didn't think they really wanted her in the nursing home 
with them. They laughed and said that wouldn't be so bad, but one wonders if 
there wasn't an element of truth in that statement. Intellectually, they want 
her to have a life of her own; emotionally, it is much harder to let go.

<p>Many people with learning disabilities have grown up having had most 
things done for them, thus they come to expect it. Parents who wrote their 
papers; mothers who cleaned their rooms and who never taught, indeed insisted,
that they learn how to do a wash or fix a salad, should not be surprised when 
the young adults have difficulty surviving on their own. Parents are teaching 
dependency when they do not teach their children to use a credit card or 
write a check. Many parents say that all of those years they were just 
struggling to get their children through high school but there is another 
three fourths of their lives after high school when other skills are needed.

<p>Socially, our youngsters tend to develop later than their peers. Because 
of language disorders they may be unable to express themselves well and may 
become the victims of other's jokes. They may have trouble understanding 
humor or sarcasm. Teasing may not be understood since children with LD tend 
to see things as black or white. Teachers need to understand these language 
disorders so they can offer the support needed to develop social skills.

<p>Many children with LD mature slower physically, developing balancing
skills long after their peer group has been bicycling or roller skating
for years. Jumping rope or playing ball are things one needs to be able
to do on the playground. To be chosen last for the team consistently is
just another way to have one's self esteem shattered.

<p>Some children cannot follow an issue to its logical conclusion. For 
instance, some time ago, we were told to expect an earthquake on a certain 
day. A student who had a note taker for his classes because of his difficulty 
with writing, asked: "If a major earthquake hits, where should I go to pick 
up my notes?" An untrained teacher might laugh, assuming the comment was a 
joke. Such a reaction could further diminish self-esteem.
<br>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES</h3>
<p>When I was a resource room teacher, it was fun to teach. I had in my 
classes five or six children per period. The only children I had were the 
real LD children. They could be grouped by skill levels and taught 
accordingly. My older daughter became a learning disabilities master
teacher, but in her classroom, she had a mixture of brain injured,
emotionally disturbed, retarded, and LD children. Out of thirty-one
children she saw in the course of the day, seven were really LD. Although
she had an aide, her role was more like that of a traffic cop. A student
assigned to her room for twenty minutes to work on spelling could not be
expected to accomplish much among the turmoil of so many children and so
many disabilities. In my own district, the range of IQ scores of children
staffed into the "LD" classrooms range from 59 to 122 - a range from
retarded to superior. With multicategorical placements where all the
children with disabilities are in the same resource rooms, it is little
wonder that being placed in special education classes today is such 
a stigma.

<p>High school teachers are trained, not in general education, but in content
areas. A history or math teacher generally teaches math or history. They
are not trained in special education or how to modify the curriculum to allow 
the student with learning disabilities to demonstrate what they have learned. 
Many prefer not to have special education students in their classes, believing 
that they slow down the other students and limit their teaching efforts. Their 
fears may be valid in cases where classes consist of students with varied 
disabilities.

<p>High school resource rooms are often used for tutoring students through 
their classes so very little effort is made to increase their reading, math, 
writing or social skills. There is no single person supervising the 
educational needs of an individual child and special education teachers say 
they have a hard time getting any modifications for their students. It is 
incomprehensible that one can take a Graduate Record Exam, an LSAT or an MCAT 
to get into graduate school, law school or medical school, untimed, with a 
reader or a scribe, but a ninth grade student is not allowed to take his math 
test untimed. Many teachers believe giving such accommodations is unfair to 
other students, ignoring or ignorant of research to the contrary. In some 
better schools, a student may be allowed to take his/her test with the 
resource room teacher, but developing basic skills is not accomplished.

<p>Additionally, many schools begin to track students into courses of a 
certain level based on their skills as early as the ninth grade, so many LD 
students are tracked into high school vocational classes. While that may be 
fine for some, it severely limits the student who may have other, more 
advanced career goals. When a student is reading poorly, it is indeed rare 
for a guidance counselor to suggest that s/he take this course if s/he wants 
to be a surgeon, or that course if s/he wants to be an archaeologist, yet 
college programs turn out surgeons and archaeologists all the time. What is 
so troubling is that we give our students so few options; we neglect to tell 
them that they have choices of careers and that we can help them discover how 
to access them. Parents may fall into the same trap.

<p>The idea of "mainstreaming" was to give special education students a chance 
to be with their peers in classes where it was thought thev would do well in 
order to improve their social interactions. Many of our students are gifted 
in art, music, math or other areas. However, if we place a student in such a 
class and s/he has to read or write  and that is an area of  disability, the 
student will fail without certain modifications.  We cannot have it both ways;
we cannot proclaim the  value  of a social learning situation and then not 
give the student a means to achieve success. A major reason gifted learning 
disabled children cannot get into gifted classes at the elementary school 
level is because there is simply too much writing, so their giftedness is 
ignored because they can't write or spell well or fast enough. Such treatment 
of our nation's children is reprehensible and it goes on every day.

<p>As the result of this nearly constant emotional trauma, many of our kids 
just give up. "What is the point of going to a place where I am constantly 
told that I am lazy, disorganized and dumb?" they say. They may not do a 
homework assignment finding it easier to say they simply didn't do it rather 
than admit they couldn't do it. Not doing it is better than failing it. One 
student brought in a paper covered with red marks: "Another bloody one," she 
said. How many "bloody ones" can a person stand before they give up?
<br>

<h3>PARENT INVOLVEMENT</h3>
<p>In the 1940's mothers marched on Albany to get  services for their retarded 
children. So it has always been. Parents must lead the way for their children 
with learning disabilities. Parents must make sure the schools use appropriate 
modifications for our children; special education teachers cannot do it alone. 
Parents must say to the schools that if they are going to fail a student on a 
history exam because s/he misspelled some of the words, then don't call it a 
history test, call it a spelling test. Parents must insist the student be 
given an oral exam to let the student show what the student has learned in 
the class. After all, that is what the teacher should want to know, and it is 
the information on which the grade should be based. At the college 
level we have no problem with this and professors are quite willing to modify 
exams, test orally, and so forth. Why must our students suffer for so many 
years before they finally get the services they deserve?

<p>As parents of children with learning disabilities, we have had to do many 
things we never dreamed we would have to do. We have had to watch our beloved 
children suffer. We have had to read the law when we would rather be reading 
a novel. We have had to intervene with schools that were supposedly there to 
support our children, but too often hurt more than they helped. It is hard to 
forgive that. All we can do is the best we can in preparing our children for 
the world in which they must live. There is still time, no matter what the 
age of your child.
<br>

<h3>STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS</h3>
<p>If your child has dysgraphia (difficulty with  handwriting) do not delay 
in making a computer available. Get the use of a computer written into his/her
IEP; that way the computer follows the child when s/he enters middle school.

<p>If your child has trouble spelling, provide a spelling ace. This device 
looks like a calculator and is worth its weight in gold to our students. It 
also allows them to use the vocabulary words they know, such as "enormous," 
instead of the one they can spell, "big."

<p>Most LD adolescents don't have many friends and don't know how to make 
friends. One student gets migraines on those rare occasions when he is asked 
to a party. His fear is very real. Join a club with your teenager so you are 
the protector until s/he can go it alone. It doesn't matter what kind of club,
anything you think you both might enjoy. Don't expect your child to jump at 
the chance at first.

<p>Help your child to be comfortable in social settings by taking him/her to 
restaurants. plays and other social gatherings. Teach him/her how to 
calculate a tip in a restaurant; how to greet others; the importance of a 
firm handshake; and having eye contact with another. We sometimes become so 
accustomed to our children's behavior that we fail to help them understand 
that standing too close to another may make them uncomfortable; we never ask 
about things like a person's age, weight, or how much money he
makes; we never brag about how much we have.

<p>If matching clothing is a problem, use magic markers to mark on the tag or
on a seam; if your child cuts out the tags - they irritate them you know - 
make a colored dot. Then take all the shirts that go with that blouse or pair 
of pants and put the same colored dot on them. Pick another magic marker and 
do the same with the rest of his/her clothes. That way you don't get plaids 
with stripes.

<p>Get maps of your town, state, the country and the world. Let him/her pick 
the route to  grandma's. When the news comes on, find those places on the map.
Show him/her where Haiti and Bosnia are. That can open a family discussion on 
whether or not we should have gone. Discuss the pros and cons of the 
elections. Lead and discuss in a safe environment and treat their opinions 
as politely as you would a stranger's.

<p>Help them to realize that they have options. If reading remains a
problem, order books on tape from your local library. If they can't add
well, develop their skills with a calculator. Teach them how to balance a
checkbook, to figure out the best buy on a stereo. Help them develop
conversational skills by talking to them and by providing gentle
feedback. In other words, help them to develop a life style as close to
that of others as possible.

<p>Teach them how to clean the bathroom, peel a potato, what to do in
case of an accident. As a family, teach time management. Put up calendars,
color coding for specific activities. On a weekly calendar, color code
homework periods, TV watching, when a paper is due and so on. If you do
this as a family, writing down the dance recital, a business meeting, an
out of town trip, it will become a natural part of their lives.

<p>Involve your child in decision making, starting with things like
topping for a pizza. In this way you establish that you respect his/her 
opinion while still being able to lead and direct him/her, and you give 
him/her experience in making decisions. When s/he has to make big decisions 
for him/herself, it won't be so frightening.

<p>Help your child understand his/her disability and put it in perspective. 
After all, 90% of them works just fine; it's that one little part that is so 
difficult to deal with. The more you accept the learning disability that
gets in the way of an otherwise great person, the more they will be able
to accept themselves. When they fully understand their own strengths and
weaknesses, they should be taught how to advocate for themselves
intelligently.

<p>Continue to work with the schools. Become a vocal advocate for children. 
We must change our educational system for these children so that it helps 
rather than hinders.

<p>Perhaps Tara, in a paper for a class in her doctoral program, best 
described what those with learning disabilities want in education. "If I were 
to develop a school today the motto would read: 'Above All Else, Do No Harm.' 
It would be a school where students would feel good about their abilities and 
would not be ridiculed for their weaknesses; a place where children would want
to be. Kinesthetic and tactile learning would be used as well as the 
traditional visual and auditory format to reach a greater number of children's
potentials. Hands on, experiential tasks would be used as well as group 
discussions in order to teach and motivate students. All children would be 
valued, regardless of social status, ethnicity, gender or disability. Peer 
tutoring would be used to show that all students have their individual 
strengths and weaknesses. In this school, there would be no more than twenty 
students per teacher. This is what I wish I had had. This is what my son will 
have. This is what I want for all children."

<p>There is a wonderful Chinese proverb which reads: "Parents should give 
their children two things, roots and wings." Make sure your children can fly.
