<p>
<p>Certain technologically important glycosidases are being investigated to gain supporting structure-function information.

<P><h2>Chemical modification studies on glycosidases</h2>
<p>
<P>Chemical modification studies are under way to gain mechanistic information on Jack bean alpha-mannosidase and <i>Trichoderma longibrachiatum</i> xylanase. These investigations are providing useful mechanistic information in support of more projects investigating applications of these enzymes.
<p>
<P><h2>Protein engineering of Jack bean alpha-mannosidase</h2>
<P>
<P>The aim of this project, funded by the University of Reading Research Endowment Fund, is to use site-directed mutagenesis techniques to investigate the structural basis of specificity. A long-term aim is to re-engineer the specificity of the enzyme to produce a more technologically useful catalyst. The research is being carried out by Heidi Burrows and is in collaboration with Prof. M. James Crabbe, School of Animal and Microbial Sciences, University of Reading.
<P>
<p><h2>Crystallisation of alpha-mannosidase enzymes</h2>
<P>
<P>The enzyme from Jack bean is currently under investigation and work is about to commence on the alpha-1,2-specific enzyme from <i>Aspergillus phoenicis</i>. It is hoped that a comparative study of the structures of these enzymes will give an insight into the structural basis of specificity. This is essential information to support our protein engineering work. The research is being carried out by Heidi Burrows in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.ifrn.bbsrc.ac.uk/">Institute of Food Research</a>.
