<P>

Southwire Company, America's largest maker of electrical transmission 
cable, 

and DOE announced a joint program to develop a third-millennium 

technology-superconducting cable that will deliver electricity at 
extremely 

high rates of efficiency.

<P>

"This is one of the most exciting and challenging projects ever 
undertaken by 

Southwire," said Roy Richards, Jr., chairman and CEO of the Carrollton, 
GA, 

company. "The efficient use of energy is critical to our country's 
future 

competitiveness, and we are confident we can make a major contribution 
toward 

that goal-confident enough, in fact, to invest our own money in the 
program."

<P>

Southwire will work closely with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to 


demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology. Under a 
cooperative 

research and development agreement (CRADA), the government will provide 


$95,000, and Southwire will contribute at least $775,000 in the first 
stage of 

what could be a multi-stage project. "This agreement demonstrates DOE's 
role 

as broker of one of tomorrow's exciting energy technologies," said 
Christine 

A. Ervin, DOE's Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable 


Energy.  "Through the marriage of two unique American strengths-U.S. 
private 

sector entrepreneurial spirit and the unique technological resources of 
DOE's 

Oak Ridge National Laboratory-our private sector partners can become 
world 

leaders in high-temperature superconducting wire and coil manufacture."

<P>

Southwire's assignment is to design and fabricate a one-meter length of 


superconducting cable for testing and verification of the project's 
concept.  

ORNL will use its unique testing facilities to measure the performance 
of the 

cable and will provide cryogenic (low temperature) systems support to 

Southwire.

<P>

"If the test cable works, then it should be possible to fabricate much 
longer 

lengths and thus commercialize what is now an experimental technology," 
said 

R. L. Hughey, project manager for Southwire.

<P>

Electrical current will be carried by silver-clad tapes containing 
dozens of 

filaments of ceramic, high-temperature superconductor. Used as 
underground 

cable in dense urban areas and through areas where right-of-way space is 
at a 

premium, the cable will deliver at least twice as much current as 
conventional 

cable and deliver the energy more efficiently.

<P>

Southwire is the nation's largest manufacturer of copper and aluminum 
rod, 

wire, and cable for the transmission and distribution of electricity.  
The 

company will handle the experimental fabrication of the cable, in which 
the 

silver-clad tape is wound around a pipe that carries liquid nitrogen and 


insulating material, which is wound around the superconducting tape.  

<P>

Southwire will also work with ORNL to design and build test equipment 
and 

perform electron microscopy to study the characteristics of materials 
used in 

the project. More information on this project can be found on the World 
Wide
