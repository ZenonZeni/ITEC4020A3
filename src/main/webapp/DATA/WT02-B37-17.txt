FEDERAL COURTS' EQUITABLE
JURISDICTION IS LIMITED,
RCRA DEFENDANTS REPLY

     The Resource Conservation Recovery Act citizen suit
defendants who are seeking reversal of the Ninth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals' determination of their liability for
restitutionary damages, on Dec. 28 submitted their reply to the
plaintiffs' arguments to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Meghrig et al.
v. KFC Western Inc., No. 95-83 (U.S.); see Hazardous Waste
Litigation Reporter, Dec. 20, 1995.

     Alan and Margaret Meghrig rejoined that KFC Western Inc.'s
position "is seriously flawed because it proceeds from a series
of false assumptions," including a "misapprehension of the
limited jurisdiction of federal courts to render equitable relief
in the face of a statute such as [RCRA]."

     KFC Western's response, the petitioners contended, "largely
ignores the thorough statutory construction analysis advanced by
Petitioners in favor of a more generalized series of assumptions
tied to Respondent's view of fairness."  RCRA's jurisdictional
statement, argued the Meghrigs, "do[es] not authorize the
district courts to broadly 'take such action as may be
necessary,' but authorize[s] those courts to restrain a person or
to order a person to take other necessary action, or both, and
nothing more."

     The Meghrigs noted the panoply of federal environmental
statutes that contain citizen suit provisions, and stated that
their respective legislative histories, "beginning with the 1970
Clean Air Act and flowing through subsequently enacted federal
environmental statutes, [confirm] congressional intent to limit
the remedies available to citizen plaintiffs by excluding
jurisdiction to award damages."

     The petitioners argued that to accept the respondents'
contention that recognition of restitution under RCRA would not
unduly interfere with CERCLA "would be to accept the proposition
that the massive legislative effort and epic compromise necessary
to enact CERCLA [was] simply swept away by Congress four years
later" with the passage of the 1984 RCRA amendments.

               The Meghrigs challenged KFC Western's assertion that the
trial court possessed jurisdiction to grant equitable relief.
"RCRA's citizen suit provision contains no grant of authority to
the district courts to formulate general federal common law,"
they contended, "and the claims of Respondent KFC, as a private
party, do not fall within any of the four narrow areas in which
federal courts have general common law jurisdiction."

     The petitioners asserted that the Supreme Court's 1992
opinion in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, upon which
KFC Western relied extensively in arguing for a federal court's
jurisdiction to fashion relief, "has no bearing on the RCRA
statute.  In Franklin, the statute was absolutely silent on the
subject of remedies available to an aggrieved plaintiff....  By
contrast, RCRA provides particularized citizen remedies, and its
legislative history and that of related statutes reaffirm the
limitations on those remedies."

     The Meghrigs averred that the relief sought by KFC Western
does not constitute equitable restitution.  "What Respondent
seeks here is compensation for an injury to its property," they
argued, "and that certainly is distinguished from an equitable
action for specific relief such as restitutionary awards of back-
pay, or return of specific property".

     In 1963, the petitioners inherited a commercial parcel in
Los Angeles from their father.  Gasoline stations had been
previously operated on the site for decades; all underground
storage tanks had been removed well before the Meghrigs took
title.

     In 1975, the petitioners sold the land to the respondent,
who established a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise on the site.
In the course of renovations in 1988, petroleum contamination was
discovered, and KFC Western spent some $211,000 in complying with
a cleanup order from the Los Angeles Department of Health.

     When the Meghrigs refused KFC Western's reimbursement
demands, the respondent started the present litigation in the
U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  The
trial court granted the Meghrigs' dismissal motion in March 1992,
holding that no "imminent and substantial endangerment" existed
to support a RCRA claim, and stating that RCRA's citizen suit
provision solely made injunctive relief available.

     In March 1995, the Ninth Circuit reversed by a 2-1 margin.
The appellate court concluded that RCRA's "imminent and
substantial endangerment" language did not act as a time-bar, and
a RCRA citizen suit plaintiff could make demand for money
damages.  The Meghrigs lodged their certiorari petition the
following July, and the Supreme Court agreed to review the matter
last October.  Oral argument in the matter is scheduled for
Jan. 10, at 10:00 a.m.

               John P. Zaimes and Clifton J. McFarland of McClintock,
Weston, Benshoof, Rochefort, Rubalcava & MacCuish, Los Angeles,
represent Alan and Margaret Meghrig.

     Daniel Romano and Sharon Corda of the Law Office of Daniel
Romano, Santa Monica, CA, represent KFC Western Inc.

VERTAC RECEIVER LOSES
BID TO SUE THIRD PARTIES
FOR DIOXIN CLEANUP COSTS

     A federal judge in Little Rock on Dec. 11 denied a motion by
the court-appointed receiver for the bankrupt Vertac Chemical
Corp. to sue other parties to recover cleanup costs that could be
used to pay Vertac's environmental debts to the federal and state
governments for the cleanup of a bayou polluted by runoff from
the plant.  United States v. Vertac Chemical Corp., No. LR-C-80-
109 (ED AR).

     U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. of the Eastern
District of Arkansas noted that the State of Arkansas is already
seeking to remedy environmental damage to the bayou and he said
he was not persuaded that the receiver's limited resources should
be used to fund an action that the state intends to pursue.

     Vertac's Jacksonville, AR, plant was acquired by Hercules
Inc. in 1961.  Hercules had manufactured the defoliant Agent
Orange at the plant from 1964 to 1968, pursuant to a government
contract.  Thousands of barrels of dioxin, one of the byproducts
of Agent Orange, and other hazardous wastes contaminated the soil
at the plant site and polluted Rocky Branch Creek, which runs
through the site and empties into Bayou Meto.  The government had
commenced a CERCLA action in 1987 to recoup the costs of
remediating the site.

     Court-appointed bankruptcy receiver Lee S. Thalheimer of the
Little Rock firm of Arnold, Grobmyer & Haley, had asked the
court's permission to file a citizen's suit under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act against others who may be liable
for polluting Bayou Meto.

     Judge Howard observed that Furrer v. Brown, a recent Eighth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals case, held that plaintiffs may only
seek injunctive relief, not a monetary judgment, under RCRA and,
therefore, the receiver would not be able to recover any monies
from an RCRA suit.  (Furrer v. Brown, 62 F.3d 1092 (8th Cir.
1995).

     He took note of the fact that the Ninth Circuit has decided
the same issue differently in KFC Western v. Meghrig, 49 F.3d 518
(9th Cir. 1995) and that the U.S. Supreme Court has granted a
petition for writ of certiorari in that case to decide the issue
of whether recovery of cleanup costs is available in a private
action under RCRA.

     Judge Howard also denied Thalheimer's request to be granted
the authority to place restrictions on the future use of the
Vertac plant.  The receiver wanted to authorize Hercules to
clean, salvage and sell plant equipment to help pay off
creditors.  Hercules had supported the request but the government
opposed it.

     Judge Howard agreed with the United States that the
receiver's request was overly broad and vague.  However, to
encourage the parties to work together, the judge dismissed the
request without prejudice to renew to give the parties a chance
to work out their differences.

6TH CIR.'S $1.5M FINE
AFFIRMANCE, CORP. OFFICER
LIABILITY FINDING APPEALED

     The Michigan RCRA defendants whose $1.5 million penalty for
noncompliance with closure deadlines was upheld by the Sixth
Circuit last July, on Dec. 1 petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court
for writ of certiorari.  Production Plated Plastics Inc. et al.
v. United States et al., Nos. 95-878 (U.S.); see Hazardous Waste
Litigation Reporter, Sept. 6, 1995.

     In addition to challenging the fine as unconstitutionally
excessive, the petitioners exhorted the High Court to "determine,
once and for all, whether Congress intended corporate officer
liability under RCRA and CERCLA, and if so, under what standard."

     The litigation stems from the operation of a chrome plating
facility in Richland, MI, which opened in 1966 and was acquired
three years later by petitioner Production Plated Plastics Inc.
("PPP").  PPP, as did the prior owner, stored sludge and process
water in on-site surface inpoundments.

     In 1977, Michigan sued PPP under the state Water Resources
Conservation Act after hexavelent chrome was discovered in the
groundwater in the plant's vicinity.  PPP closed the impoundments
in the course of the remediation plan it had agreed to with the
Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

     PPP applied for RCRA interim status for its impoundments in
1980.  PPP was unable thereafter to obtain insurance or a closure
bond, and it lost its interim status in 1985.  The federal and
state governments brought the present litigation in 1987,
alleging failure to submit a closure plan within 15 days of
losing RCRA interim status, and failure to complete closure
activities within 180 days of the state's approval of closure
plan.  Also named to the suit were the affiliated Michigan City
Plastics Co. Inc. (MCP) and Michael Ladney, the controlling
officer of both entities.
               The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan
determined in 1990 that Ladney may be held jointly and severally
liable.  The trial court granted the government's demand for
permanent, mandatory injunctive mandatory relief in 1991, and the
Sixth Circuit affirmed the following year.

     After a trial on penalties, Judge Benjamin F. Gibson in 1992
imposed a $1.5 million penalty on the defendants, and ordered the
implementation of a $2.4 million trust fund to pay for
groundwater monitoring over 30 years.  The trial court also
appointed a third-party trustee to marshall the defendants'
assets to comply with the injunction.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed in an unpublished per curiam
opinion last July 19.  The panel found no violation of the
defendants' due process rights in that Ladney operated his
businesses without regard for corporate form, and concluded that
the fine imposed was well below the $90 million potential
maximum.

     In their petition, the defendants assert that while "courts
have found joint and several liability for RCRA compliance,
penalties should be assessed separately and not jointly and
severally... [B]y clear implication, cases explaining the
requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (Due Process
Analysis) and Eighth Amendment (Excessive Punishment Analysis)
require that a court analyze behavior individually when assessing
a penalty sought by the government that amounts to punishment."

     The petitioners asserted that "[s]ince fines under RCRA are
exclusively punitive, they are fully subject to the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines.... [N]either the
District Court nor Sixth Circuit gave anything but cursory
consideration to the possibility that the $1.5 million fine, the
largest penalty in the Western District of Michigan's history,
could be excessive."

     As to the issue of owner/operator liability under both
CERCLA and RCRA, the petitioners argued that those federal courts
that have extended such liability to corporate officers have
ignored Supreme Court precedent concerning statutory
construction.  "RCRA does not define 'owner' or 'operator' to
include corporate officers, employees or shareholders," the
defendants contended.  "Likewise, nothing in RCRA's legislative
history suggests that Congress intended the joint and several
liability of corporate officers for the violations of a
corporation."

     Douglas W. Van Essen of Law, Weathers & Richardson, Grand
Rapids, MI, submitted the petition on behalf of Production Plated
Plastics Inc., Michigan City Plastics Co. Inc. and Michael
Ladney.

OCCIDENTAL PAYS $129M
TO CLOSE A CHAPTER
ON LOVE CANAL

     Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to pay the U.S.
government $129 million in cleanup costs and interest to settle a
16-year-old lawsuit resulting from decades of pollution at Love
Canal, the case that spurred Congress to enact the Superfund Law
of 1980.  United States et al. v. Hooker Chemical Corp. et al.,
No. 79-CV-990C (WD NY); see Hazardous Waste Litigation Reporter,
June 3, 1991.

     Under the proposed consent decree, announced Dec. 21,
Occidental Chemical Corp. (Oxychem) will pay $102 million to the
Environmental Protection Agency and $28 million to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  FEMA handled the initial
cleanup and relocation of Love Canal residents.

     From 1942 to 1953, Oxychem's corporate predecessor, Hooker
Chemical, dumped an estimated 22,000 tons of toxic chemicals and
hazardous wastes at Love Canal from its Niagara Falls
manufacturing plant.  The site was eventually covered over and
deeded to the City of Niagara Falls.  Homes and a school were
later built on and near Love Canal.  Chemicals began seeping into
the houses in the 1970s sickening residents; one resident, Lois
Gibbs, led a crusade to expose Hooker's actions and clean up the
site.

     In 1979, the federal government and New York State brought
suit against Hooker.  The federal government initially sought
compensation of more than $200 million in cleanup costs under
CERCLA and the state sought $250 million in punitive damages.
Oxychem was held liable in the liability phase of the trial, but
the state's claims for punitive damages were denied.

     In June 1994, Oxychem agreed to pay the state $98 million to
settle the remaining state claims.  The U.S. Army has also agreed
to pay the government $8 million for its share of the costs for
cleaning up hazardous waste that it dumped at the site during
World War II.

     The consent decree, which is expected to receive final
approval in 30 days, eliminates the need for a second trial on
damages.  Under its terms, Oxychem will pay the $129 million in
four installments over three years, beginning three months after
the court grants final approval.

     While the proposed settlement closes out the federal and
state cleanup claims, it does not end the litigation over Love
Canal.  The City of Niagara Falls is seeking $4 million in costs
and interest and 900 former residents have personal injury
lawsuits still pending.  In the wake of the federal and state
settlements, Niagara Falls expects that it will soon reach a
settlement with the company to end its suit as well.
               In announcing the settlement, U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno called it "the transformation of an environmental disaster
called Love Canal into a success story.  It stands for the
principle that when people make a mess, they should clean it up."

     A spokesman for Oxychem said that the company has never
denied liability, but that the settlement represents a compromise
among the parties on the amount of compensation, rather than
fines or penalties.  The agreement, he said avoids having to go
through a protracted trial on damages.

     Oxychem is represented by Steven K. Yablonski of Piper &
Marbury, Washington, DC.  The federal government is represented
by Steven Novick and Steven R. Baer of the U.S. Justice
Department, Washington, DC.

WD KY WON'T RECONSIDER
ORDER ALLOWING RP
SECTION 107(a) COST RECOVERY

     U.S. District Judge Joseph H. McKinley Jr. of the Western
District of Kentucky on Dec. 27 refused a defense bid to
reconsider his November ruling finding a responsible party CERCLA
plaintiff capable of suing for cost recovery under Section
107(a).  Barmet Aluminum Corp. v. Doug Brantley & Sons Inc. et
al., No. 4:95-CV-93-M (WD KY); see Hazardous Waste Litigation
Reporter, Dec. 6, 1995.

     The judge also refused the defendants request for
certification for interlocutory appeal to the Sixth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals.

     In March 1995, plaintiff Barmet Aluminum Corp. entered into
a consent order with the EPA to clean up the Brantley Landfill
site; Barmet was first named as a potentially responsible party
regarding the site in 1989.

     Barmet thereafter lodged a CERCLA Section Section 107/113
complaint against excavator Doug Brantley & Sons Inc. and its
corporate principals.  The defendants argued for the dismissal of
the allegations under Section 107, contending that Barmet's
status as a responsible party limited it to seeking Section
113(f) contribution.

     Judge McKinley held last Nov. 22 that Section 107(a)(4)(B)
imposes liability for "any other necessary costs of response
incurred by any other person consistent with the national
liability plan," and refuse to exclude responsible parties from
the defined "any other person."   He stated that the only
district court within the circuit to have addressed the issue has
twice allowed responsible parties and potentially responsible
parties to sue for Section 107 cost recovery.

               Kim K. Burke, Robert A. Bilott and Charles H. Pangburn III
of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister, Cincinnati, represent the
plaintiff.

     J. Anthony Goebel, Joseph J. Zaluski, George L. Seay Jr. and
Clinton J. Elliot of Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs, Louisville, KY,
represent the defendants.

ED WA: CERCLA'S SOVEREIGN
IMMUNITY WAIVER EXTENDS
TO STATE CLAIMS

     U.S. District Judge Justin B. Quackenbush of the Eastern
District of Washington on Dec. 11 clarified his October order in
an environmental cost recovery action against the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers.  Crowley Marine Services Inc. et al. v. Fednav Ltd.
et al., No. CS-94-178-JLQ; see Hazardous Waste Litigation
Reporter, Nov. 1, 1995.

     The judge stated that CERCLA's waiver of sovereign immunity,
which he had previously held to override the Corps' assertion of
immunity under the Flood Control Act of 1928, applied to the
plaintiffs' state statutory claims as well.

     Plaintiffs Crowley Marine Services Inc. and others, along
with the Corps, were sued in 1991-1992 by the Washington
Department of Ecology over soil and groundwater contamination in
the vicinity of a levee and drainage system owned and operated by
the Corps.  The levee and drainage system, situated on the bank
of the Columbia River, is part of a federal flood control
project.  The plaintiffs performed remediation in satisfaction of
the state suit, and brought the present action against some 20
parties who refused to participate in the cleanup.

     In his Oct. 10 order addressing the Corps' dismissal motion,
Judge Quackenbush agreed that the Flood Act barred the
plaintiffs' count under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  He
refused to find the Corps immunized on the CERCLA claims, finding
that the defendant asserted none of the enumerated defenses to
the sovereign immunity waiver, and determining that CERCLA
contains no express exception regarding Flood Act immunity.

     The Corps sought clarification of the order, seeking a
determination that the FTCA ruling carried over to the
plaintiffs' common-law tort claims, and that CERCLA's sovereign
immunity did not apply to the claims under Washington's hazardous
materials statutes.  The plaintiffs responded that CERCLA's
sovereign immunity unequivocally applies to state environmental
statutes.

     Judge Quackenbush primarily agreed that the plaintiffs'
claims for negligence/negligence per se, strict liability,
trespass, and nuisance "were applicable to the Corps only through
the FTCA," and thus were dismissed.

     In considering the claims under Washington's state Superfund
law, the Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA), the court wrote that
CERCLA Section 9620(a)(4) "provides, in pertinent part, that
'State laws concerning removal and remedial action, including
State laws regarding enforcement, shall apply' to facilities of
the United States...

     "The MTCA is similar in language to CERCLA," the judge
continued.  "The court finds that CERCLA's waiver of immunity, in
conjunction with the form and substance of the MTCA, require the
conclusion that the MTCA is applicable to the site owned and
operated by the Corps."  The court agreed with the Corps that the
waiver solely extends to sites currently owned or operated by the
United States.

     Judge Quackenbush then addressed the plaintiffs' claims
under the Washington Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA), the
state RCRA equivalent.  The court looked to the 1992 amendment to
RCRA Section 6961, which restated and emphasized the waiver of
sovereign immunity in the statute.  "The 1992 amendment was a
clear effort on behalf of Congress to equally apply environmental
standards to private citizens and the federal government," the
judge wrote.

     The judge rejected the Corps' assertion that the claim for
relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act should be dismissed for
lack of an independent basis of federal jurisdiction.
"Plaintiffs' CERCLA claims were not dismissed, and these claims
provide an independent jurisdictional basis, the court stated.

     Judge Quackenbush lastly rejected the Corps' bid to dismiss
the claim for the reasonable costs of negotiation with the
Washington state authorities, including attorneys' fees.  The
Corps asserted that such recovery was barred under the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1994 ruling in Key Tronic v. U.S.; the court
rejoined that the plaintiffs "seek recovery of attorneys' fees
under several statutes, including CERCLA, the RCRA, the MTCA, and
the HWMA.  Each of those statutes provides for potential recovery
of attorneys' fees."

3RD CIR.: NEIGHBORS,
VISITORS TO WASTE SITE
ARE NOT KNOWN CREDITORS

     Neighbors of a dump site contaminated by low-level radiation
were not known creditors and, therefore, the corporate owner of
the sites had no obligation to provide them with actual notice
when it went into bankruptcy, the Third Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals ruled on Dec. 18.  Chemetron Corp. v. Jones et al.,
No. 94-3371 (3rd Cir.).

     From 1965 to 1975, Chemetron Corp. owned and operated a
manufacturing facility that made an antimony oxide catalyst
utilizing depleted plutonium and a nearby landfill where it
dumped waste products from that manufacturing process in Cuyahoga
Heights, OH.  Chemetron sold the sites in 1975, but became
involved in cleanup efforts between 1980 and 1988 after it was
discovered that the sites were contaminated with radioactive
waste.

     In 1988, Chemetron filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania.  The court issued a claims bar date order fixing
the last day for creditors to file claims as May 31, 1988.
Chemetron sent the required actual notice to all of its known
creditors and also voluntarily placed advertisements in the New
York Times and Wall Street Journal in an effort to reach any
unknown creditors.

     In 1992, 15 individuals filed suit against Chemetron and its
successors in interest in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common
Pleas claiming to have been injured from exposure to radioactive
and toxic chemicals at the dump site.  Eventually the list of
plaintiffs grew to 21.  Two of the plaintiffs had lived in houses
near the site and the rest were periodic visitors to the houses.

     Chemetron moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that any such
claim had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings which had
ended in 1990.  The plaintiffs then petitioned the bankruptcy
court to be allowed to file late claims.   In August 1993, the
bankruptcy court granted the petition, finding that the
plaintiffs were known creditors who had been entitled to actual
notice of the proceedings and the claims bar date.  The
bankruptcy court then reserved ruling on the issue of whether the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable.

     Chemetron appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which
reversed the bankruptcy court's grant of the motion to file late
claims.  The district court held that the plaintiffs were not
known creditors and that the notice published in the two national
newspapers were sufficient to alert them to the bankruptcy
proceedings.  The district court also ruled, without explanation,
that the plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable as a result of the
bankruptcy action.

     The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit, which affirmed
the district court finding that the plaintiffs are unknown
creditors.  In Tulsa Professional Collection Service Inc. v.
Roper, 485 U.S. 478, 490 (1988), the U.S. Supreme Court
characterized a known creditor as one whose identity is either
known or "reasonably ascertainable by the debtor" Circuit Judge
Jane R. Roth wrote.  Generally, debtors are expected to identify
known creditors through a careful search of their own books and
records and further efforts are not required, she explained.

     In this case, she said, the bankruptcy court replaced the
"reasonably ascertainable" standard with a "reasonably
foreseeable" standard.  Under that test, the bankruptcy court
said Chemetron knew or should have known that it was reasonably
foreseeable that it would suffer claims from individuals living
near the sites making them known creditors.

     This "reasonably foreseeable" standard is an incorrect rule
of law that imposes an impossible burden on debtors, the Third
Circuit found.  None of the claimants currently live near the
site and some have moved as far away as Texas.  "We are hard
pressed to conceive of any way the debtor could identify, locate,
and provide actual notice to these claimants," Judge Roth said.

     Having affirmed the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs were unknown claimants in the bankruptcy action and
that the newspaper notices, therefore, were sufficient to inform
them of the proceedings, the circuit court found that the
district court erred in failing to consider whether the
plaintiffs' failure to file their claims in a timely manner was
due to "excusable neglect."  The appellate panel remanded that
issue to the district court with instructions to consider the
totality of the circumstances and the potential impact on
Chemetron.

     The Third Circuit also vacated the district court's ruling
that the plaintiffs' claims were discharged by the bankruptcy
action and remanded that issue to the bankruptcy court.  Because
the bankruptcy court had postponed ruling on the issue of
discharge, it was not an appealable order and, therefore, was not
properly before the district court, the Third Circuit said.

     Circuit Judge H. Lee Sarokin concurred in the judgment but
said that the Third Circuit went to far in discarding the
"reasonably ascertainable" test entirely.  "These tests are not
mutually exclusive, or even at odds.  They address separate
issues," Judge Sarokin wrote.  One has to do with whether a
debtor knew or should have known a claim would be brought while
the other has to do with the debtor's ability to identify a
potential claimant, he said.

     The Jones plaintiffs were represented by William Mitchell
and Deborah J. Papushak of Armstrong, Mitchell & Damiani,
Cleveland.  Chemetron was represented Dennis G. Terez of Squire,
Sanders & Dempsey, Cleveland and George L. Cass of Buchanan,
Ingersoll, Pittsburgh.

IL APP. CT. AFFIRMS
CARRRIER WIN ON LATE
NOTICE GROUNDS

     A company that waited 14 months to notify its insurers that
it might be partly liable for cleaning a hazardous waste site
cannot claim insurance coverage, the Illinois Appellate Court,
First District stated in an opinion published Dec. 14.
Industrial Coatings Group Inc. v. American Motorists Insurance
Co. et al., No. 1-94-1491 (IL App. Ct., 1st Dist.).

     Industrial Coatings Group Inc. learned in February 1986 that
it faced potential liability for hazardous waste contamination at
a site in Griffith, IN, where Industrial's predecessor had sent
used machinery solvent for processing and return.  The appellate
panel wrote that the policyholder should have notified its
carriers at that time.

     The predecessor Joanna Western Mills Co. had sent dirty
solvent to the American Chemical Services site from 1959 to 1985.
In operating the site for more than 25 years, American Chemical
buried more than 20,000 drums containing hazardous materials at
the site.  Many of the drums leaked or were punctured while other
hazardous materials were pumped into retention ponds on the site.

     After testing by the EPA, the American Chemical site was
designated as a Superfund site.  Industrial Coatings' insurance
policies provided that in the event of an occurrence, written
notice to the insurers giving the particulars was required "as
soon as practicable."  The insured, however, did not give written
notice to the insurers until more than 14 months after it had
received the EPA's letter requesting voluntary participation in
the site cleanup.

     The Cook County Circuit Court found that Industrial Coatings
gave its insurance companies late notice, that it thereby
breached a condition precedent to coverage under its insurance
policies and that the company, therefore, had no right to obtain
coverage for the pollution claim which had been asserted against
it.

     The state appellate panel affirmed, finding that the delay
in notice precluded coverage.  "Under Illinois law, a delay of
even a few months in giving notice breaches the policy as a
matter of law, defeats coverage and justifies the entry of
summary judgment for the insurance company," the court said.

AZ APP. CT. REVERSES
INSURER WIN ON TCE
COVERAGE BAD FAITH SUIT

     The Arizona Court of Appeals on Nov. 30 overturned a trial
court's dismissal of a bad faith claim lodged by an environmental
tort defendant against its insurers.  Tucson Airport Authority v.
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London et al., No. CV-95-0052
(AZ Ct. App.).

     The panel found that the policyholder adequately pleaded a
claim for the carriers' threat to drop a defense of a related
action in order to ensure the insured's cooperation in another
suit, and then withdrawing coverage because of the policyholder's
cooperation.

     The Tucson Airport Authority (TAA) had been named to two
class actions in the 1980s stemming from the disposal of TCE on
airport property.  The TAA settled with the class claimants for
$35 million in the understanding that recovery would be sought
only from the TAA's insurers.  Those class plaintiffs, in turn,
intervened in the declaratory judgment action brought against TAA
by its carriers.  The insurers contended that coverage was
unavailable to the intervenors, as the TAA was not liable for TCE
disposal by TAA's lessees.

     TAA was subsequently named to a third class suit (the Bahrs
suit); it tendered the Bahrs suit to its carriers, who agreed to
defend under a reservation of rights.  At this juncture, TAA
contended, the insurers threatened to drop the defense of the
Bahrs suit if TAA did anything to impede the insurers' attempts
to contest coverage in the declaratory judgment action.

     TAA complied, and the insurers obtained summary judgments
against the intervenors in the declaratory judgment action.  The
carriers then sought to have these judgments declared res
judicata in TAA's pending cross-action for declaratory judgment.
When TAA contested the insurers' res judicata motion, TAA was
allegedly informed that such response action cost TAA "all
defense coverage and indemnity coverage for any and all
third-party tort liability claims arising from groundwater
contamination, including insurance coverage for the third-party
liability claims presented against TAA in the Bahrs (putative)
class action."

     TAA then amended its declaratory judgment suit to include a
bad faith count, arguing that the carriers breached their duty to
reasonably balance their interests against the interests of the
policyholder.  The Pima County Circuit Court dismissed the bad
faith count.

     In its reversal, the state appellate panel cited to Arizona
Supreme Court precedent stating that "one of the benefits that
flow[s] from the insurance contract is the insured's expectation
that his insurance company will not wrongfully deprive him of the
very security for which he bargained or expose him to the
catastrophe from which he sought protection....  Conduct by the
insurer which does destroy the security or impair the protection
purchased breaches the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing implied in the contract."

     After finding the bad faith allegations adequately plead,
the court considered the insurers' contention that the claim was
based on privileged communications made during pending coverage
actions by the insurers' counsel.  The panel was persuaded by the
California Supreme Court's 1985 ruling in White v. Western Title,
which drew a distinction between a bad faith claim "based
squarely on a privileged communication, such as an action for
defamation, and one based upon an underlying course of conduct
evidenced by the communication."

     The court found that the "gravamen of TAA's bad faith claim
is not a communication, but a course of 'wrongful and tortious'
conduct evidenced by the insurers' actions and communications
during the coverage actions. Furthermore, TAA's claim does not
assail a pleading but instead alleges that its insurers followed
a course of conduct in which they failed to perform their duties
fairly and in good faith."

SD NY DENIES CARRIERS
JUDGMENT ON TRIGGER OF
COVERAGE, LOST POLICY

     U.S. District Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of the Southern
District of New York on Nov. 22 denied summary judgment to
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.
on a policyholder's coverage demands stemming from environmental
liabilities at a North Carolina site.  Unimax Corp. et al. v.
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. et al., No. 92 Civ. 6115 (KTD) (SD
NY).

     The judge rejected the carriers' contention that North
Carolina law should be construed so as to find that no
occurrences triggering coverage happened during their policy
periods.

     In 1968, the insured Unimax Corp. purchased for its
subsidiary, JFD Electronics Corp., a television antenna
production facility located in Oxford, NC.  JFD leased the site
and operated the facility over the ensuing 11 years.  In 1979,
JFD sublet the site to an affiliate of Ventura Electronics Corp.,
which also assumed the facility's operations.  The following
year, JFD purchased the remaining interest from Unimax and
conveyed the site to Ventura.

     In 1986, volatile organic compounds were discovered in the
site's groundwater; the state and the EPA commenced a cleanup the
following year.  In 1988, Ventura's successor brought a CERCLA
cost recovery action against Unimax and JFD.  The EPA notified
the insureds that they were regarded as potentially responsible
parties with respect to the site in the fall of 1989; the
policyholders asserted they first learned of the contamination in
August 1988.

     That same month, the insureds tendered notice to both
Lumbermens and Liberty Mutual; both carriers refused coverage.
Lumbermens had written Unimax and JFD umbrella comprehensive
catastrophe liability coverage from 1969 through 1971; the
insureds asserted that Lumbermens had also issued them primary
policies covering 1968 through 1972.  Liberty Mutual issued the
policyholders primary CGL coverage from 1975 through 1979.

     Judge Duffy first considered the insurers' bid for summary
judgment on the ground that under North Carolina law, an
occurrence does not take place until discovery of contamination,
and that such discovery did not occur within the policy period.
The insureds rejoined that New York law should be applied, and
that an injury-in-fact trigger should be recognized.

     The court preliminarily concluded that no conflict existed
between the laws of the interested states.  "This case," the
judge wrote, "is centered on insurance policies " i.e. contracts
" and the appropriate conflicts analysis begins with each State's
contract laws.  New York and North Carolina apply the same rules
for contract interpretation."

     In looking to the policy language, the court found that it
"clearly states that an occurrence takes place if physical injury
results during the policy period."  The judge further noted that
under either state's precedents, "contamination is deemed to be
physical injury."  The court further rejected Liberty Mutual's
contention that the insureds never responded to its summary
judgment with evidence demonstrating that contamination occurred
within the policy period.  "The focus of Liberty Mutual's motion
was that contamination was not considered under the law to be
property damage until the discovery of the damage," Judge Duffy
stated.

     The court then considered the policyholder's cross-motion
for summary judgment on the issue of the carriers' duty to
defend.  The judge granted the motion as to Lumbermens, finding
the insurer to have made no argument beyond the trigger issue.
Liberty Mutual's policy contained a pollution exclusion clause,
which the insurer argued would void coverage if New York law were
applicable to the dispute.

     On the present facts, however, the court noted that "an
endorsement to the contract specifically deleted the pollution
exclusion clause with regards to operations in North Carolina.
If New York law governs these policies, that endorsement was
misleading and created, at least, an ambiguity [that] must be
construed in favor of the insured."

     The court ultimately refused the insureds judgment against
Liberty Mutual, finding the insurer had raised a genuine of
material fact as to the plaintiffs' knowledge of their claims.
JFD had knowledge of its potential liabilities as early as 1972,
Liberty Mutual had argued and, therefore, its notice was
untimely.
               The policyholders claimed that Liberty Mutual waived its
late notice defense by not raising the defense in its 1990
disclaimer of coverage; the carrier responded that it had
insufficient knowledge of the underlying facts until discovery
had commenced.  Judge Duffy denied the insureds summary judgment
on the waiver issue.

     The court lastly denied Lumbermens summary judgment with
respect to the two CGL policies it asserted were lost.  With
respect to the 1968 through 1971 policy ("1ZL policy"), the court
noted that the insureds proffered some 100 pages bearing the 1ZL
number that was turned over by Lumbermens during discovery.  "The
only pages known to be missing are two endorsements and the
policy jacket," the court wrote.  "I find it incredible that
Lumbermens would retain this file, which imposes liability, but
lose the documents that may have relieved Lumbermens of
liability."  Judge Duffy stated that liability would be measured
according to the terms of the policy as discovered in the
insurer's files.

     As to the 1971 through 1972 policy ("8ZL policy"), the judge
found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated its existence, due to
a reference to it in Lumbermens' umbrella policy.  The court
denied  the insureds summary judgment, however, finding that
material issues of fact remained concerning the 8ZL policy's
content.

     Bruce Bienboim and Aidan Synnott of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison, New York, represent the insureds.

     Frank Torres of Evans, Orr, Pacelli, Norton & Laffan, P.C.,
New York, and Judith Fournie Helms, Catherine M. Connelly-Warren
and Katherine E. Tammaro of Tressler, Soderstrom, Maloney &
Preiss, Chicago, represent Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co.  Robert
L. Joyce of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, New York,
represent Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.
