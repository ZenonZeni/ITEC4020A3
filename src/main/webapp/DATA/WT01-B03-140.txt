<h2><a name="Would You Invest in This Stock?"><b>Would You Invest
in This Stock?</b></a> </h2>

<p>Unfortunately, for all of us who live in the United States,
whether we like it or not we own this stock. This is the chart of
the U.S. Dollar denominated in Swiss Francs. In other words this
is what the Dollar looks like to a Swiss citizen. </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftf1.gif" alt="Swiss Franc per Dollar"
width="362" height="247"> </p>

<p>In the last ten years the Dollar has lost over 50% of its
purchasing power compared to the Swiss Franc. Last month I
included a chart that showed that the U.S. Dollar remained in a
relatively narrow trading range compared to a basket of
currencies. However, if we compare it to the top performing
currencies it has performed poorly, at best. </p>

<p>The best performing currencies over the last ten years include
the Swiss Franc, the Japanese Yen and the Deutsche Mark. Granted
there have been brief interruptions in the Dollar's downward
slide such as during 1984, 1988-89, and a small portion of 1991
and another portion of 1992, but on the average the Dollar has
been losing ground against the big three and only outperforming
the worst performing currencies. </p>

<p>Primarily this is due to excess supply, i.e. the creation of
too many Dollars. Basic economic theory states that if the rate
of Dollar creation exactly matches the growth in Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) there will be no inflation or deflation. If more
Dollars than goods are created we will have inflation and if less
Dollars are created we will have deflation. This of course is
over simplified because there are a lot of other factors in play
but the basic premise holds. </p>

<p>This inflation or deflation eventually translates into a
decrease or increase (respectively) in the value of the Dollar
versus other currencies. Of course their own respective rates of
inflation or deflation must be factored into the equation also,
but eventually that is the role of the currency markets.
Currencies value may be affected by government intervention to a
certain extent but in the long term not even the combined efforts
of the U.S., Germany, and Japan can keep the Dollar overvalued
forever </p>

<p>The final factor determining the value of any particular
currency is the rate of interest paid on it and normally this
would also be determined by the free market. In other words in a
totally free market if the Mexican Peso is consistently losing
say 10% of its value per year it should pay at least 16% interest
in order for an investor to earn 6%. </p>

<p>Interest has been likened to the &#147;cost&#148; of buying
money, but in actuality it is more like the cost of renting it.
Therefore if we are to invest profitably in currencies we want to
hold a currency that provides the best combined return. By that I
mean the best combination of appreciation and interest. For
example if the Yen is appreciating by 4% per year and paying 2%
interest we will earn the same 6% as in the Peso example. The
tricky part is predicting how much the currency will appreciate
in the coming year. </p>

<p>With all that said, deciding which currency to invest in boils
down to deciding which direction a currency is headed (and by how
much) and how much interest it is paying. For the long term
investor predicting the direction is simple. In the long run the
D-Mark, Yen and Swiss Franc are headed up and the Dollar is
headed down. The long term trend is still in effect and is
primarily influenced by politicians. So unless you believe the
Senate is going to actually become fiscally responsible and
balance the budget and eliminate inflation, the current trend
will continue. </p>

<p>That said I believe that the dollar is oversold (i.e. has
fallen too much) and is due to correct in the upward direction.
So, now is not the time to jump ship on the U.S. Dollar. Ships
are a good analogy for currencies for another reason, Just like
ships they do not change direction easily. They are big lumbering
behemoths that take a lot of force to change direction. That
makes them relatively easy to invest in. They will tend in the
direction they are currently traveling until a great force builds
up. That force has acted upon the dollar and is now starting an
up trend which should last at least several months. </p>

<p>So the answer to the question &#147;Would you buy this
stock?&#148; is YES for two reasons: (1) for a portion of our
assets we have no choice and (2) in the short run it should go
up. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>How to Invest in Currencies</h2>

<p>Last month I likened currencies to opposite pairs. At any
given time some currency is appreciating or depreciating compared
to the others. Therefore if we can determine which will provide
the greatest total return we can switch to it and profit compared
to the others. </p>

<p>Currency investing in the U.S. is often considered the
province of high risk options and futures traders. In Europe and
Asia, however, people do business in several currencies everyday.
Investing and profiting for them is easier but not just because
of familiarity. </p>

<p>In most countries in the world banking includes what we would
consider several different industries. The European bank for
example handles checking and saving accounts as we would expect,
but they also handle Stocks, Bonds, Precious Metals, and Safety
Deposit Boxes. In short anything relating to money is handled by
your banker. When you think about it, it makes much more sense
than having to deal with a half dozen different establishments
and it provides a broader income base for the bank so it has less
risk of bank collapse. </p>

<p>Speaking of safety, how safe are foreign banks? A lot depends
on the country involved. Swiss banks are notoriously safe even
though they have no deposit insurance from the government. They
know there is no safety net, so they are much more careful. Other
good banks are located in Britain, the Channel Islands, Austria,
Luxembourg, the Caymans, and Hong Kong. </p>

<p>What does all this have to do with currencies? Well, in
addition to the above services foreign banks can also offer
deposits (checking and savings) denominated in any currency you
desire. So the easiest way to invest in a foreign currency is to
simply open an account denominated in that currency. You can even
get a money market account for longer terms and get a little
better interest rate. </p>

<p>Another simple way to invest in a stronger currency for the
very long term is to purchase an annuity denominated in that
currency. Annuities are buy them and forget them investments
which makes this is a very powerful method. An annuity
denominated in Swiss Francs and purchased in 1984 would be worth
at least twice what an annuity denominated in Dollars is worth
today simply due to the appreciation of the Franc. </p>

<p>The above investments involve dealing with what many of us
consider the unknown i.e. a foreign bank or insurance company.
Opening a foreign account is as simple as opening an account in
another state. Simply write or fax a request for the proper
forms, sign them and send a check with them. As long as you send
after tax dollars, openly mail a check (without concealment) and
you report the account on your income tax, it is perfectly legal
(at least for the present). </p>

<p>Incidentally, there is one bank in the U.S. that offers
accounts denominated in foreign currencies. Namely, Mark Twain
Bank of Saint Louis, Missouri. Like any other bank it has quite a
few branches and you can easily open an account with any one of
them. </p>

<p>Another way to profit from currency appreciation and the
method I used for my first currency play is to simply purchase an
ADR for a stock of the country you expect to appreciate. An ADR
(American Depository Receipt) is simply an IOU for a stock from
another country. Rather than have to contact the company every
time a US citizen buys a share of their stock a US bank holds the
stocks and issues a receipt for X number of shares. </p>

<p>Several years ago I reasoned that the D-Mark was due to rise
and consequently all German stocks would appreciate against the
Dollar. Naturally a good stock would be even better, so I
researched the German stocks available as ADRs and found that
Daimler Benz (the maker of Mercedes) was relatively cheap. After
several months, Benz had appreciated about 20% in Mark terms and
the Mark had appreciated an equal amount against the Dollar. So
an easy way to play the currency is buy the stock. Had I been
wrong in either case (about the stock or the currency) I still
had a very low risk situation. </p>

<p>Higher risk methods of investing in currencies are currency
options and futures contracts and a third alternative called a
sandwich offered by foreign banks. Let's assume that we want to
profit from the coming increase in the Dollar. We could borrow a
weaker currency from the bank and pay the conversion fee and
deposit it back with the same bank. Since the money never leaves
the bank and it is earning the loan rate on the one currency, the
banks usually require a very small percentage of the total as
security. This gives you a great deal of leverage but also a bit
of risk should the currency go against you. This works best when
the currency you are borrowing has a low interest rate and the
one you are depositing has a high interest rate. In that case, in
addition to currency appreciation you receive the difference
between the two interest rates. Unfortunately, this situation
doesn't occur too often. </p>

<p>If anyone would like the names and addresses of reputable
foreign banks send a self-addressed stamped envelope and I will
be happy to send you a list. </p>

<h2>Microsoft-- A 5000 Pound Gorilla?</h2>

<p>I'm sure everyone has heard the jokes about the five-thousand
pound gorilla. &#147;Where does he sleep?&#148; &#147;Where does
he go?&#148; etc. The answer of course is &#147;Anywhere he wants
to!&#148; The same is almost true for Microsoft. Microsoft has
grown in the past decade from nothing to one of the world's
largest corporations. In the process it has turned Bill Gates
into the world's richest man and made billionaires out of several
of his early friends and associates. </p>

<p>In the last year Microsoft has gone from a low of 53 7/8 to a
high of 110 1/4. Currently it is trading around 98. </p>

<p>Earlier this year Microsoft (MSFT) tried to purchase Intuit,
another software maker whose one claim to fame is a program
called Quicken and its big brother Quickbooks. This purchase of a
relatively small potatoes company stirred up such a ruckus that
the Department of Justice (DOJ) stepped in and used every trick
in the book to stop the purchase. </p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why the DOJ would even care? Microsoft
had an accounting program of its own called Money, but had
already made arrangements to sell it. So there really wasn't any
conflict, they just wanted to own a different accounting program. </p>

<p>The real reason was that Quicken has millions of users tied
into electronic banking. Microsoft wanted to buy those users!
This would have, in effect, made Microsoft one of the biggest
banks in the world! </p>

<p>I personally, don't think that would have been a bad thing. It
would have been profitable, safe, progressive and provide
services the customer wants. In addition it would have been
capable of competing with global banks that no other U.S. bank
can touch. But the DOJ didn't see it that way. </p>

<p>Well, Microsoft being an agile gorilla and moving a bit
quicker than the lumbering DOJ, appears to have pulled an end
run. Along with its long planned Windows95 it has included a bit
of a ringer. </p>

<p>Microsoft included a button that signs you up for Microsoft's
new on-line service, which will compete with Prodigy, America On
Line and CompuServe. So far not even the DOJ has been able to
stop this new wrinkle. Since Microsoft is not &#147;tying&#148;
i.e. forcing anyone to purchase anything extra with this button,
it is just giving it away and if you don't want the button you
can erase it or not install it in the first place. </p>

<p>What does this have to do with banking? Well, all the
established on-line services allow you to open brokerage and
banking accounts on-line. We must assume that Microsoft On-line
will do the same! </p>

<p>How much revenue will this new venture generate? At this point
I have not heard any estimates or even much interest in the
banking end of it but I'm sure Microsoft feels it will be very
profitable. </p>

<p>Speaking of profitability, how profitable will Windows95 be?
Pros in the computer industry estimate that Windows95 itself will
generate between .8 and 2.4 Billion in revenues for Microsoft in
the next year alone. </p>

<p>There has not been a new operating system release in several
years, so there is quite a bit of pent-up demand just waiting to
explode. Microsoft has put off the release of this long awaited
software a couple of times trying to be sure it will be bug free
and have enough drivers to make it work relatively well from the
start. A lot of people feel it will solve all their computing
problems. In addition, the computer sellers are planning on using
it as a &#147;loss-leader&#148; to get people into their stores.
All this bodes well for Microsoft. </p>

<p>At first glance, Microsoft appears a bit pricey at almost
twice its low for the year and with a P/E of over 40. <i>P/E is
price divided by earnings and a low P/E (say &lt;10 or so) is
generally considered a bargain. </i>But if you factor in
projected earnings Microsoft is back in the reasonable price
range. </p>

<p>Several subscribers asked for quick turn profit
recommendations like the technology stocks that I mentioned in
last month's issue. <b>I believe Microsoft will trade up to its
old highs and above within months of the release of Windows 95 in
late August.</b> </p>

<p>Microsoft is a good short term speculation. If it is still
trading below 100 by the time you read this it is a definite BUY!
Since most technology stocks are hot right now I probably would
not plan on holding for the long term at this point. This is
simply a play on the release of Windows95. </p>

<p>The conservative way to play this is to buy the shares
outright. The speculative way is to purchase the options.
Currently there are LEAPS (Long Term Options) available on
Microsoft. The symbol for the Jan 97 Call with a strike price of
100 is (ZMFAT). This would be a good play if (MSFT) is below 100.
Since these are such long options you could try for a little more
speculation and use the 105s (ZMFAA) or 110s (ZMFAB). You can buy
one contract of the 110s for around $1000 should Microsoft go to
120 in the next few months (ZMFAB) should double. </p>

<p>An interesting point about options is that although they are
considered higher risk than buying the stock outright a case can
be made that they are actually less risky. Assume you buy 50 MSFT
at $100/share you have $5000 at risk. Should Microsoft return to
$50 you are out $2500. Had you purchased the long term calls one
contract which controls 100 shares (instead of 50) would cost you
about $1800. In the previous case with a fall to $50. your option
might be worth $300. Assuming a short time has expired, your
actual dollar loss is $1500. A much smaller loss. In the event of
a gain say the stock goes to 120 at that point your 50 shares
would be worth $6000 for a gain of $1000 but your option should
be worth $35 or so for a gain of $1700. So you made more or lost
less. The major drawback to options is the time factor, if you
don't make money quickly the time value evaporates and your
option expires worthless. This is less of a risk with Leaps since
they are so long term. </p>

<p>The only &#147;fly in the ointment to purchasing Microsoft
would be if the DOJ makes Microsoft pull the Microsoft Online
button. This is unlikely and would costly but not disastrous. In
the event of a correction, due to DOJ actions, I would double up
and buy more Microsoft. Plan on taking profits when Microsoft
reaches 120. The more cautious should place a trailing stop 10%
below your purchase price. Remember this is a short term
speculation not for the more conservative investor. </p>

<h2>The Moore Inflation Predictor</h2>

<p><img src="../images/ftf2.gif" alt="August, 1995:MIP"
width="455" height="311"> </p>

<p>As we can see in this months Inflation Predictor Chart the CPI
peaked in May and has steadily declined through July. </p>

<p>As a point of clarification, had we been publishing at that
point, we would have recommended the purchase of the Benham 2020
mutual fund in May rather than July when our first issue was
actually, published. In May (BTTTX) was trading at around $18.50.
It quickly climbed to 21 retraced to below 20 and as of this
writing is headed higher, probably through the cycle bottom in
September. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Indexes and Rates</h2>

<p>The July Consumer Price Index (released in mid-August) was
identical to the Index of June, which resulted in a decline to
2.76% in the inflation rate from a rate of 3.04% in June.
Statistically, the reason for this is that the rate is a
composite of a string of twelve numbers and a high one was
dropped from the beginning and a zero was added to the end. </p>

<p>The government however, rounds the rates reported and
therefore publicized 2.8% and 3.0% respectively. </p>

<p>For some perverse reason known only to Statisticians and
bureaucrats they called it a seasonally adjusted increase of .2%.
The truth is, it is a .28% decrease and the decline will continue
through September. This deception may have had some small but
temporary effect on the bond prices but it provides a big lesson
in why we need to base our financial decisions on a source other
than the nightly news. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>6 Month Predictor</h2>

<p>The predictor chart as shown on this page has indicated a
reversal is imminent. It actually has already reversed and so
active traders need to watch the price of Silver and begin
looking for a good entry point. For the sample portfolio we will
recommend Silver Calls.</p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Tracking Accuracy</h2>

<p>Many of you have asked how well the opposite pairs are
tracking the CPI. </p>

<p>Gold and Bonds have not been as accurately tracking the CPI as
Silver and Platinum have. This is one reason (BTTX) had an upturn
rather than simply a flattening over the previous month. </p>

<p>Silver and Platinum, however, have done a good job of tracking
the CPI and therefore we will be using them to catch the upturn.
We are expecting an uptick in their respective prices beginning
in September. In addition, Silver tends to be more volatile than
Gold and should therefore result in a greater percentage rise and
begin a bit earlier. Also Silver has shown unusual signs of
market activity as mentioned last month. The Silver Mutual Fund
of Choice is Lexington Strategic Silver. As you can see from the
Gain / Loss chart Invesco Strategic Gold is the Gold Fund of
choice having the largest gain during the CPI uptick of Mar-May
1995 and the largest loss during the downtick last
October-January. </p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Worst Performers</h2>

<p>Based upon the last down period of the CPI i.e. October
1994-Jan 1995 the Funds that lost the most and reacted the
quickest therefore ought to gain the most during this short
upturn: Last time around Lexington Strategic Silver was a big
loser but was not one of the biggest gainers I am betting it will
do better this time around but it is really a toss-up between it
and Invesco. Strictly speaking the numbers indicate Invesco.so
the conservative portfolio will be half in Lexington Strategic
Silver and half in Invesco Strategic Gold. </p>

<p>The Speculative Stock Portfolio will be half in Echo Bay (ECO)
and half in Coeur D' Alene (CDE).</p>

<p>[<a href="#In This Issue . . .">Top of Page</a>]</p>

<h2>Changes and Formats</h2>

<p><img src="../images/ftf3.gif"
alt="August, 1995:6 Month Predictor Chart" width="455"
height="311"> </p>

<p>Many of you requested that I continue to publish the actual
CPI Index numbers in table form. So, I have decided to make the
last page a data page. It will include the Gold chart along with
its moving average, the Silver chart with its moving average and
a table of values for the CPI. In addition, it will include my
recommendations for the three portfolios (although I have
rearranged them from most conservative to most speculative). I
hope the last page will provide a quick overview of the entire
newsletter for those of you who are very rushed for time. Other
changes are for readability. A vast majority of subscribers
wanted larger charts or at least larger words, so we are trying a
three column format. As a new publication we will continue to
change and hopefully develop a useful, readable style. I would
like to thank all of you who subscribed and I appreciate your
comments and will try to incorporate as many as possible. </p>

<p>Another request was for a telephone Hotline, we are
considering this and will see as we get more subscribers. Another
thing in the works is eight pages rather than six.</p>

<p>As long as you remain charter subscribers I promise you the
best renewal rates and possibly other special bonuses as well. I
want to continue to be responsive to your needs and wonder how
many of you have email? I have considered starting a newsgroup or
forum on line. If you are interested, drop me an email message at
TJMcMahon@AOL.com. </p>

<p>Welcome and Thanks for Subscribing! I hope to continue to
provide value and service for your money. </p>
