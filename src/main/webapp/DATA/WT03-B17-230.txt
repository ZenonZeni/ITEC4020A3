<STRONG><H2>The Drip system</H2></STRONG>
     A good drip system is important. A soaker hose will work very well
here.  The soaker hose can be buried about 2 to 4 inches from  the  top
and  can  be  moved  as needed. Remember where the  hose  is  to  avoid
damaging when planting. A battery timer will help to control the  water
and  is easy to operate. Place a garden filter between the hose and the
timer. Your garden will love this extra touch.

<STRONG><H2>Buy Earthworms for your garden</H2></STRONG>

Earthworms will love your raised bed. Give them a head start by  buying
african red wigglers which is the best kind for this use.

<STRONG><H2>Planting the Vegetables</H2></STRONG>
     Start by making a list of the favorite vegetables that you like to
eat.  If you haven't grown a garden before, I suggest that you  take  a
gardening class to help you out. Consider joining a garden club as they
are  a  great  source of not only help but seeds, resources  etc..  The
varieties that you choose to grow will be important and you must  learn
which  will  grow  in your area. I also suggest that you  get  heirloom
seeds  instead  of  the commercial ones. Try Seeds of Change,  Abundant
Life, Native Seeds, Herlooom Garden Seeds, Native American Seed, Native
Seeds/Search, Bountiful Gardens, Peace Seeds, Plant Finders of America,
Ronniger's  Organic  Seed  Potatoes,  Seed  Savers  Exchange,  Southern
Exposure  Seed Exchange, For more resources try Acres USA.

<STRONG><H2>Mixing Flowers and Herbs</H2></STRONG>
     It  is  a  good  idea to plant flowers and herbs along  with  your
vegetables for best insect protection. Try 50% flowers and herbs  along
with your vegetable garden.
