<I>Mike continues to describe additional vehicles in the race-ed</I>.<p>

Greenwich High School's Solar Flair I is number 68, returning for the third
year.  Mark Smith described it as having a 9-inch Advanced DC motor powered by
20 6-Volt Trojan T145 batteries through a Curtis 1221 controller, in a 1978
Volkswagon Rabbit body with a Rabbit diesel transmission.  This year they have
added a radio (take care of the important things :-), replace the speedometer,
and added hold-down straps for the batteries.  And watch
next year for their all solar car.<P>

Becky Guartha is one of the students from Mt. Everett High School's Project e-
(pronounced "E Minus").  This Chevy S-10 conversion is the same vehicle as
raced last year, but it is not the same.  As Becky described it, what was
once a purely plug-in-to-charge electric vehicle is now a series hybrid.  They
have added a propane-fueled 22 horsepower (12 kW) Kohler internal combustion
engine that drives a Fisher 3 phase, 12 kW, 120 volt, 92 amp generator.  (The
engine/generator system is sold by Solar Car Corporation in Melbourne,
Florida.) It either idles or is manually throttled up to charge the batteries
or take up some of the motor load while underway.  The projected range is 300
to 500 miles on a 10 gallon tank of propane.  There are 20 6-Volt batteries
and the motor is a 28 HP Advanced DC.  A 30 amp alternator with electric
clutch adds regen braking.<P>

        Becky and Rachele Batacchi are the school's first female navigator and
driver team.  Rachele spoke about having to watch the amp meter and the
tachometer to decide when to shift for best efficiency.<P>

        Jake Dupont is a mechanic on the team.  He said that when the
batteries are fully charged a regulator detects that and automatically
throttles back the engine to idle to prevent overcharging.<P>

The Ecovox is from Dartmouth University is number 95.  Jeff Braciak described
this series hybrid vehicle, meaning that only the batteries drive the wheels.
The batteries are charged by a 1.4 kW Honda generator which was converted to
ethanol from a tank that I guess is about 1 gallon.  The driver has a single
switch to start and stop the generator.  The 120 Volt AC output is run through
a diode bridge and voltage regulator to get it to the 72 Volts DC needed to
charge the batteries.<P>

        The car body looks like one you would see on a solar car.  It is a
thin tappered tube, about 12 feet long, with two wheels in the front and a
single driven wheel in the rear.  The electric motor is a 7 HP brushless DC,
supplied by 6 small Sears DieHard tractor batteries.  Before the race, the
electric drive had gone about 200 miles, and the generator system had about 50
miles.  It can do 45 to 55 mph. During inspection the Ecovox had a ground fault which took a couple of
hours to isolate and repair.<P>

RHAM is number 76, from Rham Science and Technical High School.  John Dudek is
the faculty advisor and this car is back for (at least) its third year.
What's different this year?  The battery pack has been increased from 96 Volts
to 120.  Same old controller, same old motor.  (Presumably a Curtis 400 amp
and an Advanced DC 9-inch.)  Last year, John was praising the `BATT juice'
battery additive (from B.A.T Technologies) that he was using in his batteries.
He felt they were giving him something extra.  This year, he added the extra
batteries late, and so did not have time to get the additive into the new
ones, thus they are running with a mixed system: new batteries without
additive plus old batteries with.  But the new batteries will get "juiced"
after the race.  Why?  "Because we got 23.76 kiloWatts out of a 96 Volt system
last year, with Trojan T145s," says John.<P>

Ottawa Orange II is number 37 again this year, basicly the same chassis and
solar panel arrangement as last year, but with some differences.  Josh Ike,
James Merriweather, and Randy Mahar told me they increased the battery pack
from 32 Volts to 74 Volts, using Advotech batteries.  They also replaced the
wooden plank which is the flexible element of the front wheels suspension in
the 3-wheeled vehicle, and put in a new braking system.  The solar panel has
been increased to 1300 Watts and the instrumentation has been localized so the
driver can easily see every gauge.  The box tubing frame is the same as last
year, although the mylar fabric cover is now thicker, and the nose is more
aerodynamic to reduce drag.  This 800 pound vehicle has been tested up to 65
mph, and the range has been tested at 200 miles(!).  The first day of testing,
Saturday, the solar panel was cutting out as it flexed while being driven.  By
the time they figured out what was wrong, almost all the stores were closed.
At the last minute, they found some curtain rods (the rectangular cross-
section sheet metal types) and used them to brace the outside edges of the
panel against the lower frame of the car, forming your classic triangular
brace.  The team was 13 students with specialties of mechanical, electrical,
body, design, business, and coordinator.  The project was completed for an
estimated cost of $20,840.  (Many of the student vehicles have handouts with
the vital statistics, participants, advisors, sponsors, etc.  The Ottawa
Orange II is one of the best.  It is also dedicated to Dwakeely S. McMillan,
February 20, 1976 - March 12, 1995.)<P>

Erik Wachtmeister is the co-president of the team that built Photon, number
86, which won the Tour de Sol racing class in the 1994 ATdS.  "This year the
front wheels have been redone completely.  They are two inches taller, have
new rims, new centers, new tubes that are Kevlar reinforced and are racing
slicks.  There is a better seat which is more comfortable, the lights are more
aerodynamic, we now have two rearview mirrors instead of one, and have rigged
up a helmet communication system between the driver and the chase vehicle.  We
now have more a more accurate reading of the power consumption that is hooked
up to a computer that periodically saves the information" for later analysis.
A fan on the back helps keep the motor cool.<P>

        The battery is a 84 Volt pack built from 7 Sears DieHard deep cycle
RV/Marine batteries.  The 8 HP brushless DC motor and controller are made by
Solectria.  The frame is welded aluminum tubing covered with a vacuum bag
molded body made of 6 pieces.  The body skin is two layers of Kevlar with a
foam core.  The front suspension is off a Yamaha Blaster ATV, the rear
suspension is off a Yamaha 176 motorcycle.  The solar panel is made up of 8
modules of 20 Volts and 60 Watts each.  All the above is the same as last
year.<P>

        The team was made up of 30 students, with 5 faculty advisors.  Various
subteams tackled the improvements listed above.  For example, the new seat was
done by underclassmen.<P>

Angelo Esposito built Fulmine, number 69, after helping Scott Isgar build his
"Solar Delivery" Volkswagon Vanagon conversion that raced in the ATdS last
 65Angelo Esposito built Fulmine, number 69, after helping Scott Isgar build his
"Solar Delivery" Volkswagon Vanagon conversion that raced in the ATdS last
year.  Fulmine is a conversion of a 1980 Hundai donated to him.  The primary
reason for doing the conversion was to let Angelo experiment with his own
transmission design.  After about 700 miles of testing, he removed the
transmission and gave it to a machine shop to build as a final product, which
is in the works right now.  Just for the race, he reinstalled the original
Hundai transmission.  The battery pack is 10 12-Volt Deka Dominators type
8GHD, huge beasts which weigh 161 pounds each!  The car has an overall
weight of 3500 pounds and can carry 600 pounds.  These drive a 400 amp Curtis
controller which in turn drives a 9-inch Advanced DC motor.  Angelo is hoping
for 100 to 120 miles range.<P>

Robert Larsen from Argonne National Lab is the boss of Spencer Quang and
Nicole LeBlanc, who were doing the safety test.  Argonne is doing several
things new this year.  DOE, through Argonne, provided free ampere-hour meters
for all the student-built vehicles this year, and worked very hard with NESEA
to be sure that almost all the rest of the vehicles would also have them.  The
result is that the energy consumption readings will be much easier to acquire
and compare.  (Two years ago, I remember watching the testing teams going
slightly crazy trying to figure out how they were going to connect the amp-
hour meters in for a quick [well, it was supposed to be quick] energy use
measurement, and the various owners worrying that the act of installing and
removing the wiring and shunt would somehow mess up their car!)  On top of
that, they encouraged NESEA to instrument the charging station for both
power consumption and power quality, which will now allow them to do a much
better job of performing from-the-wall-plug-to-the-wheel energy use analysis.
(In the past power quality has meant power factor and power factor has
been measured as the phase angle between the voltage and current waveforms.
[Shades of Electric Machines 101!]  As we will see later, it is now
much more complex than that, and a very real problem in EV charging.
In particular, some charges induce huge voltage and current spikes on the
AC line, call "harmonics" that can cause real problems.)<P>

Bob does not believe there has ever been such a large group of EVs connected
to one charging station, although the APS 500 races have also been a learning
experience.  Another purpose is to start educating the teams and the EV
 81to one charging station, although the APS 500 races have also been a learning
experience.  Another purpose is to start educating the teams and the EV
community to be aware of these issues and how important it is to have very
efficient chargers.  Bob says they have seen chargers with efficiencies as
high as 90% and as low as 30%; a huge variation.<P>

        Again this year they have 8 data collection memory modules that they
will be putting into selected cars, as they did at the 1994 ATdS.  These
modules record second-by-second data such as motor current and voltage,
battery current and voltage, plus there is a Global Positioning System (GPS)
receiver that lets them collect position, velocity and acceleration from the
GPS link.<P>

        I asked Bob what he thought of the field this year.  In general he
thought the overall quality of the cars is very much better this year.  The
Solectria prototype Sunrise is of particular interest, because it points
towards the future.<P>

        Bob is also one of the designated drivers of the most polluting car in
the race.  A Geo Metro LSI sedan, number 10, is being driven in the race and
being timed as if it were a race vehicle.  (The Metro is the base vehicle for
many conversions, including those that Solectria and BAT Technologies
produce.)  By using this car as a control vehicle, they will have a very good
benchmark for the NESEA Energy Challenge, looking for the car with the best
overall energy efficiency and hence the highest oil-well-to-wheel-well
equivalent miles-per-gallon of oil.  The results of this and other tests will
be presented at the Sustainable Transportation Conference in Providence RI
this fall and then at the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) conference
about 5 weeks later.<P>

        Speaking of papers, the DOE has been writing EV and Hybrid-EV papers
over the years and many are published through the SAE, which has an excellent
on-line search system.  Contact the SAE for more information.<P>

        Bob also had high praise for NESEA's organization and operation of the
ATdS.  "As far as we are concerned, this is biggest bang for the buck that DOE
gets.  I hope that budget considerations will allow us to be a major sponsor
in future years."<P>

Number 49 is ERANGE, is a motor scooter built by Helmut Schiller and  Wolfgang
Woitowicz, who built the CityCat that won the Open Category in the 1994 ATdS.
ERANGE claims a range over 100 miles, speed up to 50 mph, weighs 300 pounds,
is 100% recharge in 30 minutes, and an efficiency of over 35 miles per
kiloWatt-hour.  The power comes from 3 12-Volt Horizon batteries delivering
3.4 kiloWatt-hours.  This scooter uses the next generation of the motor used
on the CityCat.  This permanent motor, which boasts 95% efficiency, uses a
low-voltage, high-amperage disk armature that uses copper plates instead of
copper wires.  The permanent magnets provide the stator (non-rotating) field
and the armature has 8 brushes and 129 fields on the commutator which gives
very, very smooth acceleration.  The controller is a pulse-width modulated
type of their own design, but for the ATdS they are using a Curtis controller
because that way they can easily get a spare.  As I understand it, their
intention is to offer a power-train package (motor, controller, and
instrumention) that would be licensed exclusively to a scooter manufacturer to
create a line of electric scooters and 3-wheeled vehicles.<P>
