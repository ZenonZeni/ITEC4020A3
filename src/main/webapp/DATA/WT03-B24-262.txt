<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - The United Farm Workers and the AFL-CIO have 
launched the biggest organizing drive of an industry in 40 
years as they begin a united effort to unionize 20,000 
strawberry pickers. Those who work the strawberry fields 
work as many as 12 hours a day stooped over in the mud for 
an average of $20 a day.</p>

<p>The "National Strawberry Commission for Worker's Rights," a 
coalition of more that 40 national organizations, has held 
press conferences in Washington, New York, Boston, Baltimore 
and other cities to build support for the pickers across the 
country.</p>

Times are good for the strawberry industry with record sales 
of over $650 million and production topping a billion 
pounds. The growers are concentrated in California but the 
strawberry industry is dominated by eight giant corporations 
which buy, "cool," market and distribute the product around 
the globe.</p>

<p>"Coolers" tell the growers what type and amount of 
strawberries to grow, and even the type and amount of 
pesticides to use in the process. Strawberries picked in 
California end up as far away as France and Japan.</p>

<p>Per capita consumption of strawberries has grown from three 
pounds in 1974 to five pounds in 1994. Today strawberries 
are the fifth largest-selling crop in the country. If growth 
continues at its present pace - doubling between 1971 and 
1980 and again between 1981 and 1990 - the industry would 
gross $1.1 billion by the year 2000 and $2 billion by 2010.</p>

<p>The strawberry companies also receive help from their 
friends in government. Last year the federal government 
contributed close to $500,000 to subsidize the industry's 
overseas marketing. And the California Strawberry 
Commission, which consists of growers, shippers, processors 
and one public member, levies a tax on the industry which 
last year netted $4.5 million to be invested in the industry 
in the form of marketing and research. Recently, however, 
the companies have used part of this money to fight off 
accusations and improve their public image through 
advertising in the media.</p>

<p>For the workers, on the other hand, the fruit of their labor 
has not been so sweet. The average picker earns $8,500 per 
season. But this is only an estimate since some are paid by 
the hour, others by the crate and still others by a 
combination of both methods. Piece rates are often less than 
minimum wage and no premium pay for overtime.</p>

<p>When inflation is considered, the income of strawberry 
workers, who have not had a considerable raise in a decade, 
has plummeted between 25 and 53 percent. The cost of housing 
takes a considerable share of this income as dilapidated 
motels rent for $150-$200 a week.</p>

<p>The growers have various techniques for evading their 
responsibilities to the workers. Their favorite is having 
the pickers work as sharecroppers. This means they lease 
land to a person who turns over much of the crop to the 
field owner as payment for operating the field. Up to half 
of the state's strawberry workers are sharecroppers. But, 
sharecroppers must take whatever price is offered by the 
owner of the land and they often end up further in debt at 
the end of a season.</p>

<p>The sharecroppers, who are already under financial strain, 
often employ others who are legally the responsibility of 
the land owners. This situation increases the level of 
exploitation.</p>

<p>Another danger faced by the strawberry workers is 
pesticides. The rate of pesticides on strawberries can be up 
to 50 times that of grapes. The fields are covered with up 
to 300 pounds of pesticide per acre, more than any other 
crop in the state. More than four million pounds of methyl 
bromide is injected into the ground each year to fumigate 
the soil.</p>

<p>Methyl bromide has been linked to over 400 illnesses and was 
scheduled to be banned this year. But after heavy lobbying 
by the growers the California legislature delayed the ban. 
The Western Growers Association gave more than $30,000 to 
California Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign fund in 1994.</p>

<p>There are also widespread violations of state labor laws 
including child labor, sexual harassment, filthy - or no - 
bathrooms and no drinking water. Leobaldo Acosta, a 
strawberry worker from Salinas, Calif., said at the New York 
press conference on Nov. 21, "We have to work in the fields 
when it rains, in the mud and after accidents. We are not 
scared of working - we're just demanding a just wage. We 
have decided as farm workers that unity is the only way." 
Delfina Rodriguez, a mother of two, described how even after 
suffering a back accident she had to continue working to 
provide for her children.</p>

<p>The president of the New York City Central Labor Council, 
Brian McLaughlin, said at the conference, "We are not going 
to sit by as the companies buy off elected officials," and 
urged everyone to wage the type of grassroots campaign that 
brought victory to the grape workers.</p>

<p>Arturo Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers of 
America, called for a 5 cent increase in the price of a pint 
which consumers buy in stores which would result in a 
worker's salary being increased by 50 percent. The other 
demands of the union are clean drinking water and bathrooms, 
job security, health insurance, and an end to sexual 
harassment and other abuses.</p>

<p>Speaking at the conference in Washington, AFL-CIO President 
John Sweeney said, "Strawberry workers aren't on the bottom 
step of the economic ladder - they're not even on the 
ladder." Sweeney said African-American workers in Southern 
manufacturing plants, Asian Americans in sweatshops and 
restaurant workers are also on the same downward spiral. 
Calling for unity, he said, "Our fight is their fight and 
their fight is our fight." </p>

<p>A.L. Everett, president of the Texas Central Labor Council, 
told the World that they are also working with the national 
leadership supporting the campaign for justice for the 
strawberry pickers. The strategy of the UFW and AFL-CIO is 
to pressure the coolers to acknowledge that they control the 
industry and are accountable for the abuses they create and 
be encouraged to help improve conditions for strawberry 
workers. It is believed this pressure will convince the 
growers to negotiate a nationwide agreement which will 
improve the lives of the 20,000 workers.</p>
