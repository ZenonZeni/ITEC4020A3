<p>The Rational Behaviour Model (RBM) architecture is based on
three levels of abstraction: Strategic, Tactical and Execution.
The use of different computer languages and different abstraction
mechanisms at each level offers important advantages in the
design and maintenance of control software. RBM is a
specialization of the SSS (Symbolic, Subsumption, Servo)
architecture. Strategic level: entirely symbolic, with no global
variables; its task is to designate and sequence particular goals
through decisional processes; it uses rule-based languages,
Prolog and Clips; it executes top-down mission analysis based on
goal-directed reasoning, and decomposition of the root goal into
a sequence of primitive goals, until they can be simplified no
further, and sends direct implementation messages to the Tactical
level; it has non-interruptible functioning, is not event-driven,
and receives lower level information by a polling technique. Tactical
level: asynchronous interface between the other two levels; it
decomposes high-level tasks so as to produce commands for lower
level execution; it uses languages that support object
hierarchies and event-driven multitasking, such as CLOS (the
object-oriented version of Common Lisp) or ADA; it is a
collection of objects and related methods, which may call on
other methods at the same level or send commands to the Execution
level; it executes data collection and replanning, if needed; in
order to prevent conflicts between behaviors, this level is
implemented as a hierarchy of objects: offspring objects are
components of parent objects and can only be accessed by them,
while the single root object is responsible both for
communications with the Strategic level and for transmission of
orders to the Execution level; decisions are made in response to
queries received from the high level at any time, and information from
the lower level is received using &#145;interrupt&#146;
techniques. Execution level: synchronous and entirely numerical
level; it operates vehicle actuators and sensors in response to
higher-level commands; it uses languages such as C, C++ and ADA,
which work within multitasking operating systems and utilize
timed interrupts; all commands and actions which could endanger
the vehicle are overridden here. </p>
