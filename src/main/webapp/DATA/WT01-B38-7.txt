<p align="center"><a name="METHADONE MAINTENANCE AND PREGNANCY"><b>METHADONE
MAINTENANCE AND PREGNANCY</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p>In the September issue of <b><i>Methadone Today</i></b>, the
National Alliance of Methadone Advocates' (NAMA's) Methadone
Awareness question was regarding pregnant women and methadone. At
that time and as a result of the article, several questions were
raised, so I have decided to expand on the topic to try to answer
them. </p>

<p>The following information and quotes come from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). This publication
can be obtained at no charge by calling 1-800-729-6686 and asking
them to send &quot;(SMA) 93-1988&quot; (Pregnant, Substance-Using
Women) or more simply, &quot;TIP 2.&quot; The information
contained in TIP 2 comes from a rather lengthy 90-page booklet
with a full two-page list of contributors known as the <b><i>Consensus
Panel</i></b>. There is also another full page of <b><i>Tip Field
Reviewers</i></b> who &quot;were selected to review and comment
on the draft document based on their knowledge of and concern for
the special needs of pregnant, substance-using women.&quot; </p>

<p>The consensus is that methadone maintenance &quot;is a <b><i>well-documented
approach to improve outcomes for both the woman and her fetus
[and] is strongly encouraged for all pregnant, opioid-dependent
women</i></b> [emphasis mine]. It provides the following
advantages: </p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>Reduces illegal opioid use as well as use of other drugs.
    </li>
    <li>Helps to remove the opioid-dependent woman from the
        drug-seeking environment and eliminates the necessary
        illegal behavior. </li>
    <li>Prevents fluctuations of the maternal drug level that may
        occur throughout the day. </li>
    <li>Improves maternal nutrition, increasing the weight of the
        newborn. </li>
    <li>Improves the woman's ability to prepare for the birth of
        the infant and begin homemaking. </li>
    <li>Reduces obstetrical complications. </li>
</ul>

<p>Medical withdrawal of the pregnant, opioid-dependent woman
from methadone <b><i>is not indicated or recommended</i></b>
[emphasis mine]. Few women will have the motivation or the
psychosocial supports to accomplish and maintain total
abstinence. The goal, therefore, is to achieve the best
therapeutic dose possible with which the woman feels comfortable.
The neonatal abstinence syndrome can be treated with minimal
complications. </p>

<p>Despite the above caution, at times, medical withdrawal may
need to be considered due to logistical or geographic barriers.
In these cases, <b><i>the decision to undertake such a program
must be a joint decision between the obstetrician, the woman, and
her counselor, with the understanding that few women will be
appropriate candidates for this approach</i></b> [emphasis mine].
</p>

<p>The woman should understand that she must prove she is a
candidate for medical withdrawal by complying with prenatal and
therapy appointments and supplying clean urines. If at any time
the woman is unable to comply with these requirements, no further
decrease in dosage of methadone should be ordered. . . .<b><i>Patients
should be allowed to discontinue withdrawal at any time, for any
reason, without feelings of guilt</i></b> [emphasis mine]. They
should be then be placed into a methadone maintenance program at
a therapeutically sound dose. Clinicians need to be particularly
aware that a decrease in methadone dosage could precipitate a
relapse to drug use. Patients in continuous treatment who return
to illegal drug use should be placed back on methadone. Methadone
is preferable to the use of illegal street drugs. </p>

<p>. . . .Medical withdrawal from methadone is usually done in
decrements of 2 to 2 ½ mg every 7 to 10 days. This procedure
should only be done in conjunction with an obstetrician who can
monitor the effects on the fetus. <b><i>Intrauterine demise
(death of the fetus in utero) has been documented as a
complication of medical withdrawal even when done under optimal
conditions, such as hospitalization and close fetal monitoring</i></b>&quot;
[emphasis mine]. </p>

<p>It is clear that the consensus is that pregnant women who are
dependent on opiates should be placed in a methadone program as
soon as possible and should not be detoxed during the pregnancy.
The dosing guidelines are the same for pregnant as well as
nonpregnant substance users. &quot;Based on current and emerging
research, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) suggests
that maintenance doses below 60 mg are not effective and hence
not appropriate. Arbitrary low-dose policies for pregnant and
nonpregnant patients is often associated with increased drug use
as well as reduced program retention. Based on current informed
consensus, the most prudent course is to rely on individually
determined methadone dosing that is measured by the absence of
subjective and objective abstinence symptoms and the reduction of
drug hunger.&quot; If you are pregnant and an opiate user, it is
crucial that you find a program that will maintain you on
methadone for your health and that of your developing fetus. </p>

<p>New Hampshire is one of the few states that does not have
methadone maintenance, but they recently passed a bill (June
1996) that would allow pregnant opiate users access to methadone.
The downside is that there is a stipulation that &quot;the length
of time for methadone use after birth shall not exceed 3
months.&quot; The months following birth of the child should not
have the added stress and complication of a methadone detox. If
these women are not ready for detox, they will most likely return
to drug use instead of using the respite from drug chasing to
enjoy their child. If they were allowed to remain on methadone
maintenance, this could be avoided. </p>

<p align="center">The good news is that a former legislator (see
story on page 2--Harm Reduction Conference) is researching
methadone and running for office again this year. Advocate Dan
Sundquist is on the job also. <b><i>Thanks for the information,
Dan</i></b>. </p>

Consumers' Meeting &amp; Harm Reduction Conference</b></a> </p>

<p align="center"><b>METHADONE CONSUMERS MEETING &amp; HARM
REDUCTION CONFERENCE<br>
<br>
</b>Methadone patients and advocates from across the United
States met in Oakland, California on September 17, 1996 to set up
a Methadone Consumers' Advocacy Agenda. These patients and
advocates are doing something to change treatment back to Dr.'s
Dole and Nyswander's caring model instead of resigning themselves
to the current prohibitive policies of methadone treatment in the
United States.<br>
<br>
&quot;At the Tuesday Consumer Meeting, we formed a Committee that
put together The Methadone Consumers Platform,&quot; said
Joycelyn Woods, Executive Vice-President of NAMA. &quot;It was
read at the Final Plenary and was the only report from groups
that got several cheers--more than several in fact. The cheers
were for statements like &#145;No Blind Dosing', &#145;No
Discharge without Due Process', and &#145;No Discharge for
displaying symptoms of our disease' (using drugs). So I think we
brought down the house.&quot;<br>
<br>
Through Joycelyn and e-mail, I met former New Hampshire State
Representative, Patricia M. O'Keefe, who was &quot;co-sponsor of
both a needle exchange bill and a bill to remove the prescription
requirements to purchase syringes and decriminalize possession of
such items.&quot; Ms. O'Keefe said of the conference, &quot;I
thought it was really well organized, and...I came away from it
with a much clearer vision of harm reduction. One area really
impressed me--some presenters that were on methadone maintenance
really blew me away and made me realize that I don't know enough
about the treatment, that I had preconceptions of methadone
maintenance that were inaccurate and distorted, probably similar
(but not so extreme) to those in the legislature that have to be
educated about the treatment. I never realized I had these
stereotypes in my head until I witnessed these highly functioning
individuals. . . .I am kind of embarrassed by my ignorance. .
.[but] I look forward to researching the subject and rectifying
the situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is wonderful commentary, and Ms. O'Keefe does not need to be
embarrassed about not knowing about methadone maintenance
treatment. Look at the ignorance in the medical profession
regarding substance abuse and methadone maintenance, look at the
answers to the many myths we have been publishing, and look at
some of the ignorance even in the field of methadone maintenance
put forth by counselors and doctors who should be knowledgeable
about their business. There is no shame in being unaware--the
shame is in staying unaware and the perpetuation of the negative
stereotypes of the methadone-maintained patient. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Medical Maintenance"><b>Medical
Maintenance</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">As with so much about methadone maintenance, I
knew nothing of this thing called Medical Maintenance when I
first started as a patient advocate in August 1995. The concept,
when I first learned of it, fascinated me. But, why should it?
Because we have been so brainwashed into thinking that we are
criminals, moral degenerates, and undeserving that it just
doesn't occur to us think of ourselves as patients. We are told,
if not implicitly then at least we are certainly given the
feeling, that we are not entitled to this life-saving
medication--that it is a privilege. To those of you who read Dr.
Payte's, &quot;Insulin Treatment in Diabetes. . .,&quot; in
September's Methadone Today, apply that last statement to his
thesis. It's absurd when applied to insulin for diabetes, but we
believe it about methadone. Well, I don't believe it anymore.<br>
<br>
D. Novick et al (1988 June 10 JAMA 259; 3299-3302) wrote in
&quot;Medical Maintenance: A New Model for Continuing Treatment
of Socially Rehabilitated Methadone Maintenance Patients&quot;
about the study of the first 40 medically maintained former
heroin addicts. These patients are seen in the atmosphere of a
doctor's office, with an appointment during regular hours, along
with other medical patients. At the visits, the patient submits a
urine, takes a dose of medication in front of the doctor or his
staff, completes a questionnaire, and is interviewed. He or she
may receive up to 28 days' medication at the doctor's discretion.
These patients do not receive the counseling that is mandatory in
the clinic setting but may be referred to counseling if needed. <br>
<br>
Some of the requirements for Medical Maintenance are:<br>
<br>
1. Five years in methadone maintenance treatment.<br>
2. Employed or other productive use of time for the past three
years and legitimate income.<br>
3. No criminal involvement for past three years.<br>
4. No drug or alcohol abuse for the past three years.<br>
5. Record of reliability in methadone maintenance, i.e. regular
attendance at counseling sessions, urine submissions, no requests
for replacement bottles of methadone, and have obeyed clinic
rules.<br>
6. Decision that long-term methadone maintenance will be
necessary, i.e. unsuccessful detox attempts, judgement of patient
and doctor.<br>
7. Emotional stability.<br>
8. No socializing with illicit drug users (to diminish
diversion).<br>
9. Recommendation from clinic with thorough knowledge of
patient's history.<br>
10. Patients must be volunteers and agree to participate in
research evaluations.<br>
<br>
This study began in June 1983; as of January 1988, &quot;in
follow-up ranging from 12 to 55 months, 33 (82.5%) of 40 had
remained in medical maintenance, yielding an annual retention
rate of 94%. Five (12.5%) patients had been discharged because of
cocaine abuse and returned to a conventional methadone
maintenance program.&quot; Three of the 33 patients had brief
incidents of substance abuse but were &quot;resolved with
counseling and increased frequency of office visits with urine
monitoring. Only four instances of lost medication occurred in
the 1381 patient-months of this study. No overdoses of methadone
were reported by patients or their families.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of an additional 37 patients who were added to Medical
Maintenance &quot;between April 1987 and May 1988, 36 have
remained stable during 1-14 months of treatment, with no
documented substance abuse. One patient was transferred back to
his previous program after having repeatedly exceeded his daily
methadone dose. Thus, of the 77 patients admitted to medical
maintenance since its inception, 69 (90%) have remained in
treatment as of this writing (June 1988).&quot;<br>
<br>
Other patients were added to Medical Maintenance in 1989 to total
100. Patients were followed in Medical Maintenance for a total of
3.5-9.25 years. As of September 1992, the number of patients in
good standing was 72. Of the other 28 patients who left Medical
Maintenance, only 15 were unfavorably discharged--11 for cocaine
use, 3 for misuse of medication, and one (1) was discharged for
repeatedly failing to keep appointments. <br>
<br>
Patients perceived the benefits to be &quot;that of being treated
in a more professional atmosphere. They have reported improved
self-esteem from being regarded as medical patients rather than
drug abusers, from being rewarded with a degree of trust after
many years of excellent performance in treatment, and from no
longer being required to receive unnecessary supportive services.
. . . Patients have also stated that the 28-day reporting
schedule markedly reduced problems in work attendance and
maintaining confidentiality. . . Medication in tablets rather
than as a liquid which required constant refrigeration also
allowed patients to take extended business trips or vacations.
Finally, the physician-patient relationship is improved, since
treatment decisions are based on clinical indications rather than
impersonal regulations.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is a great outcome when we stop to think about it. Out of
100 heroin addicts who were out on the street costing themselves
and society untold grief, 85 were salvaged and contribute to
themselves, their families and society because of methadone and
medical maintenance. Granted, most of them would probably have
remained in the clinics if they had not been accepted for medical
maintenance, but after five years of repressive clinic rules,
they had earned by their exemplary behavior the chance to be free
of some of the restrictions .<br>
<br>
We need more doctors who are knowledgeable about substance abuse
who would be willing to integrate methadone patients into their
practices. Of course, there is the problem of regulation , the
DEA and other government agencies; and believe me, as methadone
patients we know about regulations and sympathize with those
doctors who would be willing to do this. We would, however, also
be eternally grateful. <br>
<br>
Even though I have once-a-week take homes, I have a 45-minute
drive each way to the clinic in good weather and drive a car with
over 100,000 miles on it. After eight years, I am more than ready
to find a local physician who would be able to prescribe for me
on a monthly basis. Some of us just do not need weekly or twice
monthly counseling sessions, nor can we afford them. </p>

<p align="center"><a
name="Depressive Episodes in Methadone Detoxes"><b>Depressive
Episodes in Methadone Detoxes</b></a> </p>

<p align="center">There may be a good reason why many have a
difficult time detoxing off methadone. According to Philip Kanof
et al, in the <b><i>American Journal of Psychiatry </i></b>(1993
March), &quot;development of an organic mood syndrome is a common
occurrence in patients undergoing slow detoxification from
methadone maintenance treatment and is associated with a poor
outcome. <br>
<br>
Even with these 24 highly-motivated patients, the failure rate
was substantial. The patients were selected for detox because
they were not using any illicit drugs, were not involved in
&quot;drug-culture-related activities&quot;, were employed and
had stable family relationships. Thirteen (over half) of the
patients involved in the study did not complete the
detoxification.. <br>
<br>
All of the patients were stabilized and maintained at a starting
dose for 2-5 weeks before start of detox, and all data obtained
at this time was referred to as the baseline. The study was
double blind which means that neither patient nor investigators
knew the patient's dose. All of the patients' daily doses were
decreased by 5mg weekly until their dose reached 15mg. At that
time, the daily dose was decreased by 3mg weekly.<br>
<br>
Using 3 different rating scales, 2 of which were subjective and
one objective scale, these patients were self- and staff-rated
for signs of opiate withdrawal on a weekly basis. &quot;Patients
who failed to complete detoxification manifested significantly
greater increases from baseline in symptoms of dysphoria as
measured by&quot; subjective and objective signs of opoid
withdrawal. &quot;The results indicate an association between the
emergence of clinically significant symptoms of dysphoria and
lack of success in therapeutic detoxification from methadone
maintenance.&quot; Symptoms including fatigue, insomnia, loss of
appetite, etc. suggest &quot;criteria for a major depressive
episode as defined in DSM-III-R. However, the prompt reduction in
symptoms of dysphoria following restabilization on methadone. .
.clearly demonstrates the organic etiology of the prominent mood
disturbance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Does this mean that all is lost and that we will be dependent
forever on methadone? These researchers feel that there may be
good evidence that anti-depressants should be started before
detox in order to prevent or treat depressive symptoms. Also, all
of these subjects were detoxed at the same rate, but we are all
individuals and need to detox at our own rate. Some of us may
need to stop the detox several times to become restabilized
before continuing. <br>
<br>
The point needs to be made, however, that methadone maintenance
is a legitimate treatment for opioid dependence, and it is not
the be all and end all of every methadone-maintained person to
detox. The world will not come to an end if we have tried to
detox and have been unable. The subjects selected seemed to be
doing just fine before they started to detox. Remember the
criterion for being selected--the subjects were not using any
illicit drugs, they were employed or going to school, were not
involved in drug-related activities, and they had improved and
stabilized family relationships. What do we define as success?
Let's not put people in impossible situations. If a person wants
to detox, that's fine--more power to them if they can do it. If
they can't, but have made all those other improvements in their
lives, why can't we leave them alone? </p>

Policy Foundation Grant</b></a> </p>

<p align="center">With the next issue of <b><i>Methadone Today</i></b>
will come funding from the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). Many of
you know how we have struggled to keep the newsletter in print
and mailed over the past year, and this grant comes just in time
to save it. We appreciate the opportunity that the DPF grant has
given us to keep the lines of communication open and encourage
even more patient and clinic participation. Thank you, DPF!!!<br>
<br>
The DPF puts out a pamphlet which states that it was established
in 1986 and is the &quot;leading independent forum for
alternatives to the failed drug war, including legalization,
medicalization and harm reduction. The basic premise of the
Foundation's work is that a war is not a domestic policy. . .
.The Foundation counters drug-war spawned misinformation and
hysteria through accurate research and a widespread educational
campaign. Because of [their] work, the media and the public
increasingly recognize the destruction and futility of the drug
war.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now that the funding problem is not at crisis level (we can still
use a dollar or two from our readers to defray costs), and we
will be putting out an issue every month, we are hoping that many
more of you will submit articles for publication. If you
submitted an article that did not get published, it may not have
reached me. However, mail comes directly to me now, and I will do
my best to include every person's efforts. Don't worry about
spelling--that is the function of the spell checker and the word
processor. We want your ideas, stories and concerns. This is your
newsletter. Has something happened to you at a clinic that you
feel is unfair? Have you ever been in jail and been denied
methadone treatment? How about the hospital? Do you have a
counselor or other staff member who has gone to bat for you when
no one else would? What were you like before methadone, and what
are you like now? We know you have an amazing story, and we want
it. If you prefer, we don't have to publish your name.<br>
<br>
The DPF has notified us that the only condition of funding for
the newsletter is that we do not publish any articles that could
be construed as lobbying. Although we have published some in the
past, they have been assured that we will not do so during the
next year using any of their funding, equipment or supplies.
According to Webster's Dictionary, &#145;lobbying' is defined as
&quot;a group of people trying to bring pressure to bear on
legislators to pursue policies favorable to their interests.
Please keep this in mind when submitting articles.<br>
<br>
This is an appropriate place to offer thanks to NPL and
especially Arlene Heiser for their generous support in making
sure we have had access to equipment and supplies for printing
Methadone Today. Thanks to Sterling for allowing me to interrupt
his work space (doing so with good grace) while making copies of
the newsletter, to the counselors for not saying much when
getting in their way, to Kemmer for allowing me to disrupt
Wednesday mornings, and to Dr. Burk just for being himself.<br>
Thanks to Penny for writing the rough draft of the body of the
grant. To Joycelyn Woods, Executive Vice-President of NAMA, many
thanks for her help and support every day through <br>
e-mail communication and especially for helping us through the
grant process when all the while she was busy writing her own..

name="The Use of Insulin in the Treatment of Diabetes:   An Analogy to Methadone Maintenance"><b>The
Use of Insulin in the Treatment of Diabetes: <br>
An Analogy to Methadone Maintenance</b></a><b><br>
by J. Thomas Payte, M.D.</b>1 </p>

<p>A five-year study was conducted on 300 insulin-dependent
diabetics. The purpose of the study was to determine if the use
of insulin resulted in any long-term benefit to diabetics. The
concept was based on two widely accepted hypotheses: (1) that a
formerly insulin-dependent diabetic could learn to live a
comfortable and responsible life without insulin, provided that
he or she wanted to badly enough; and (2) that the use of any
exogenous substance to replace or simply substitute for a
deficient endogenous substance is conceptually unacceptable to
modern scientific thinking and may be inherently evil.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that exogenous insulin, being highly suspect at the
outset, should be used in the lowest possible doses and for the
shortest time possible. In this study, treatment with insulin was
limited to two years and the daily dose was limited to a maximum
of 40 units. The posttreatment follow-up period varied from three
days to three years, depending on the duration of survival.
During the treatment phase (insulin maintenance), random urine
samples were collected under direct supervision and tested for
glucose at least weekly. A positive urine glucose resulted in a
warning to the patient. After three positive urine tests, the
dose of insulin was reduced by five units daily for each positive
urine test. This policy was intended to increase motivation on
the part of the patient to provide urine specimens negative for
glucose. If positives continued, the insulin was eventually
discontinued and the patients were placed in the follow-up group.
The authors of the study felt that patients would have a better
chance of reentry into insulin maintenance at a later date if (a)
the patients survived and (b) patients accepted full
responsibility for their insulin dependence and were willing to
go to any lengths to recover.<br>
<br>
All patients were required to endure one hour of individual or
group counseling each week, which addressed such subjects as meal
planning, hygiene for the feet, pancreatic imagery, and dietary
assertiveness. Counseling patients fell into one of three
categories: those who had no need or desire for counseling; those
who might need counseling but were entirely unwilling to
participate; and those who both wanted and needed extensive
counseling, but the counselors were so busy spending an hour a
week with the others that they were unable to meet the increased
demands and needs of this group. Avoiding this bothersome,
time-consuming, and costly process of individualized treatment
also served to reduce the risk of enabling the patients'
maladaptive behaviors by what could seem to be a reward system.
The resulting uniformity of service assured that the needs of no
one were met. It was hoped that by making the treatment
unpleasant that motivation for recovery would be enhanced.<br>
<br>
Half the participants failed to complete the two-year treatment
with insulin maintenance. Some patients simply dropped out of
treatment, but most were terminated for continued
glucose-positive urines. This was despite repeated warnings and
in absolute defiance of the reductions in insulin dosage with
each glucose-positive urine. It was concluded that this
population is poorly motivated, difficult to work with, and is
lacking the resources needed to effect the major life changes
required for recovery. Many of this group died during follow-up.
Some survived with amputations, blindness, neuropathies, and
other conditions associated with the unhealthy life-styles of the
diabetic.<br>
<br>
The remaining half did manage to complete the two-year treatment
and even appeared to experience relatively good health and
seemingly normal functioning. Of course, this illusion of
apparent good health was at the expense of continuing to maintain
the insulin-dependent status with daily insulin. Some
investigators speculated that insulin might be continued over a
longer period of time and at higher doses. This notion was
quickly rejected as being absurd because good health should not
be obtained at just any cost. As the patients approached the
two-year period, the insulin doses were tapered over the final
two months. All subjects began having positive urine tests and
again were showing active insulin-dependent diabetes. The obvious
conclusion is that insulin does not help the insulin-dependent
diabetic and is not effective in treatment. The high mortality
rate of posttreatment patients suggests that insulin may have had
some delayed, deadly toxic effects. This concept should be the
subject of future research.<br>
<br>
<b>COMMENT<br>
</b>This &quot;insulin spoof&quot; was originally written with
the idea to share it among friends and colleagues. Somewhat
surprisingly, the spoof was well received by many who urged that
it be shared with a wider audience. Initially, the intention was
to transpose rather typical and illogical clinical thought
processes about methadone maintenance to another more familiar
chronic and incurable disease.<br>
<br>
The transposition to a disease that is much more widely
understood made the line of reasoning clearly absurd in the new
context. Yet when this pseudologic is applied to chronic opiod
dependence and methadone maintenance, few people find anything
wrong or out of place. One might conclude that the vision of some
is clouded by the philosophical and ideological considerations
that erect barriers to understanding, accepting, and implementing
this lifesaving treatment modality for those chronic intractable
heroin addicts who need it.<br>
<br>
Any humor in this parody is quickly lost when one estimates the
loss of life and other costs associated with untreated heroin
addiction that can be attributed to a persistent shortage of
methadone treatment slots. This shortage is due, in part, to
persistent negative attitudes toward the methadone treatment
modality. </p>

name="Hair Testing for Drugs--A Case for Discrimination"><b>Hair
Testing for Drugs--A Case for Discrimination</b></a> </p>

<p>Our laws against certain drugs began as a result of
discrimination against minorities. The first two laws against
opiates were passed in response to discrimination of the Chinese;
they were thought of as an inferior race. In 1910, legislation
was requested regarding cocaine since its use was touted to be
the direct incentive to the crime of rape by Negroes. Thus, the
stage was set for greater and greater social control and loss of
liberty.<br>
<br>
When urine testing began in the workplace, it was for those who
had jobs such as air controller, pilot, etc.--those who had to be
aware of public safety concerns. Now, any employer can test
anyone for drugs--from the person who routes airplanes to the one
who sweeps the floor. It is bad enough that a person has to
submit to tests that allow an employer to have access to what was
done over the weekend, even when proficiency testing is available
and could properly show fitness for work. Proficiency testing
tells the employer if you are able to do the job--without
invading your privacy. <br>
<br>
Now, however, the big push is for hair analysis, which tells your
employer what you did all last year. Despite the problems
associated with urine testing (threat to personal liberties, lab
error, false positives, etc.), the time it takes the body to
break down a drug is relatively the same in all races; not so
with hair testing. This method allows whites, who used drugs at
the same time as their African-American counterparts, to escape
detection while African-Americans are either denied jobs or
fired.<br>
<br>
According to a study done by Gary Henderson, Ph.D., at the
University of California at Davis, at the same dose,
non-Caucasians had up to 12 times as much cocaine in their hair
as Caucasians. Also, the drug stays in the hair for longer
periods of time--greater than 10 months for one non-Caucasian. <br>
<br>
The reason for this may be that cocaine binds to melanin, as
reported by Robert Joseph et al at the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences in Nashville, February 19-24, 1996. Some of the
findings were: <br>
<br>
Male, African, black hair--10 times more binding for cocaine than
male Caucasian brown/black hair.<br>
<br>
Untreated, male African black hair bound cocaine almost 500 times
more than blond Caucasian hair.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Bleached</i></b> male African hair--four times that of
blond male Caucasian hair.<br>
<br>
Green et al, <b><i>Journal of Analytical Toxicology</i></b>
(March/April 1996), in an animal study, reports that the ratio of
methadone in black to white hair is 21 to 1--this despite the
fact that the melanin content in the black hair used in this
study was only 3.5 times greater than that of the white hair.<br>
These are not the only problems with hair testing. There is no
uniformity in the testing cutoff point (point at which it is
agreed that a test is negative), and there are no set testing
techniques. In other words, four different labs may use four
different ways to produce results. There is also the problem of
environmental contamination, among others.<br>
<br>
The best that can be said for hair testing is that it indicates
whether a person has used drugs or not. However, the problems far
outweigh the benefits (if any) of such a test. Why in the world
does an employer need to know whether a person took drugs 6
months ago? In fact, why do they need to know if a person took
drugs last night? If a person can pass a proficiency test
(computer testing for awareness, alertness, and ability to do the
job competently) that is all the employer needs to know.<br>
<br>
According to H. Westley Clark, M.D., J.D.,, M.P.H., University of
California, &quot;African Americans, Hispanics, and East Indians
are at greater risk. . .&quot; for detection of drug use. They
also test for a longer period of time than Caucasians. &quot;Hair
analysis is a very good technique to foster discrimination. [It]
has the aura of science, [and] it is pushed by scientist [sic]
who can use fancy terms and fancy language to reassure employers,
politicians and courts that only drug users are being identified
by the techniques involved.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dr. Clark suggests that African Americans could bleach their hair
to &quot;level the playing field.&quot; Or, we could all go one
step further and shave our heads. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Buprenorphine vs Methadone"><b>Buprenorphine
vs Methadone</b></a> </p>

<p>Buprenorphine is an analgesic for use in the treatment of
opiate addiction. It produces less euphoria than morphine and
heroin, and &quot;some studies also suggest that withdrawal
effects are less severe with Buprenorphine than with
methadone.&quot; As with LAAM, it is released slowly so that
dosing may be every other day instead of every day as is done
with methadone.<br>
<br>
A study done by Dr. Eric Strain et al at Johns Hopkins University
found that patients who were treated with Buprenorphine stayed in
treatment as long as those who received methadone. In another
study by Dr. Rolley E. Johnson et al, done with about the same
number of patients (162), the retention rate was somewhat less
(42% as compared to Dr. Strain's 56% retention rate).<br>
<br>
Buprenorphine &quot;is administered under the tongue via a small
syringe. Patients do not swallow the medication but allow it to
be absorbed through the mucous membranes that line the inside of
the mouth.&quot; Another difference is in the dose--8 mg of
Buprenorphine seems to be equal to 50-60 mg of methadone. In Dr.
Strain's study, if a patient's urine tests showed opiates, the
dose &quot;could be increased to a maximum of 90 mg of methadone
or 16 mg of Buprenorphine.&quot;<br>
<br>
The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) &quot;officials are
quick to caution that approval of Buprenorphine would not
diminish the importance of methadone in the treatment of heroin
addiction. &#145;It's certainly not our intent to supplant
methadone,' Segal says. &#145;Rather, NIDA wants to expand the
drug treatment armamentarium and the overall number of patients
in treatment.&quot;1 </p>
