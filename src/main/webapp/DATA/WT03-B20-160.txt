<H2>How easy is it to detect meat mixtures ?</H2>
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>




<P>It has long been recognised that unscrupulous traders might be tempted to adulterate meat products. There are potential profits to made from substituting a cheaper meat for a more expensive cut of the same species, or of higher-value species. Particularly in minced meat, canned meat, sausages and pies etc, it is relatively easy to see how a cheaper meat might be introduced in place of the meat supposed to be present. </P>

<P>Clearly, deliberate mixing is fraudulent and an offence unless the meat product is accurately labelled. In the case of cross species adulteration, it is also potentially offensive to any religious community that might have a prohibition on the consumption of certain animal products.</P>

<P>Isolated cases of mixing may also arise from inadequate cleaning of mincing equipment etc. Though accidental, such contamination would be no more acceptable to consumers or trading standards authorities. It would also point to an alarming failure to observe basic hygiene controls during processing.</P>

<P>The recent press coverage of the finding by Hounslow trading standards officers of beef mince in lamb mince has alerted the general public to the issue of mixing. Six out of the ten lamb mince products purchased were found to contain beef. In one case the beef content was claimed to be as high as 10%. The results were made public in August although the survey took place in April/May. </P>

<P>Not surprisingly, the finding of such a high percentage of beef content raised the issue beyond that of misrepresentation of products. The suspicion was that otherwise unsaleable beef was being deliberately added to lamb mince. Regardless of any intent to deceive the public, the finding added further to the concerns about BSE. Whilst there was no evidence to suggest that the beef concerned was in any way infected with BSE, the findings did nothing to improve consumer confidence in the meat trade. What it did do was confirm the importance of methods for identifying mixing.</P>

<P>Laboratory techniques for identifying different species of meat are based on the genetic and chemical differences between the species. A thorough account of appropriate methods is given in the text book &#39;Food Authentication &#39; (Blackie) in the chapter on  &#39;Authenticity of meat and meat products&#39;.</P>

<P>The most widely used methods are immunological assays (looking at species specific proteins, again most commonly in raw meat although cooked meats may be assayed using different test kits), electrophoretic (looking at protein markers in raw meat), and DNA methods (applicable to both raw and cooked meats). Lipid analysis has limited application in identifying the fatty acid and triglyceride components of meats but the technique is relatively insensitive.</P>

<P>The sensitivity of these techniques will vary, often according to the quality of reagents used as much as the quality of the meats being tested. High performance liquid chromatography, electron spray mass spectrometry and near infra red spectrometry have also been used or studied as speciation techniques with varying degrees of success. However, these techniques are unlikely to be commercially viable at least in the short term.</P>

<P>In any scientific analysis it is important to appreciate the limitations of the technique for answering a given question. Therefore, it is vital to run detection limit controls, and false positive / false negative controls especially with immunological techniques.</P>

<P>None of the techniques as described is able to differentiate between meat from different breeds, although DNA analysis has the potential to differentiate between breeds. </P>

<P>However there is enough concern about mixing meats between species to provide enough impetus for further research in this area. An EU Standards Measurement and Testing project is currently underway which aims to prepare homogeneous and stable meat species reference materials for use in intercomparison studies to investigate and evaluate the analytical procedures for meat speciation commonly used within in the EU. The project is being coordinated by Ian Lumley of the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, and author of the chapter referred to above. This programme is well advanced and preparation of the required samples has been completed. A number of laboratories across Europe have participated in the first stages of the study, and a second stage of interlaboratory comparisons and further method developments are yet to be proposed.</P>

<P>In the meantime, the meat industry must do all it can to regain and preserve consumer confidence in its products. At the very least that must mean taking every step to ensure the authenticity of its products. Where authenticity is in doubt, any of the rapid screening techniques referred to above might be used to identify the suspect products, which can then be subjected to more thorough testing. </P>
