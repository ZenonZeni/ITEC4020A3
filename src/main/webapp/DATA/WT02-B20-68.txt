	Finds that a dysgraphic patient used nonlexical processes to spell many 
words.  Notes significant correlations between the relative frequency of 
phoneme-grapheme mapping options and the relative frequency of the patient's use 
of the same written language options.  Concludes that syllable structure is 
involved in the process of converting phonology to orthography in nonlexical 
spelling.  (RS) <BR>

	Annual evaluation for 5 years of the handwriting of 121 Dutch primary school 
children revealed that children with dysgraphic handwriting had lower fine 
motor ability, exhibited poorer structural performance, and, in higher grades, 
showed less preference for a personal style, than did other writers.  Children 
with and without dysgraphic handwriting did not differ in writing speed.

	The rapid, disjointed, and vivid style of Sesame Street may impede rather 
than promote progress toward literacy and the development of voluntary 
attention.  It robs children of the ability to create mental pictures.  Contends 
that it is a failure as an instructional medium.  (DM)  <BR>

Journal Announcement: CIJJAN89  <BR> 
	The case study describes a middle-aged man whose developmental dyslexia and 
dysgraphia have persisted for the 30 years since he left school.  The 
phonological dyslexic appears to operate on too large units with performance on 
paralinguistic rhyming tasks, and with higher order sound segmentation, 
analysis, and organization poor.  (Author/DB)  <BR>

	Reports a study that compared the spelling performance of a 17-year-old 
developmental dysgraphic of normal intelligence to that of an acquired 
dysgraphic.  Findings indicate that both make phonologically valid errors and 
spell regular words better than irregular words.  These performances reflect a 
phonological routine corresponding to that used by normal children.

	Intended for teachers and parents, the handbook provides suggestions for 
diagnosis and remediation of the learning disability dysgraphia (difficulty with 
handwriting).  The seven chapters have the following titles and sample 
subtopics: (1) "The Student with a Learning Disability" (what causes dysgraphia, 
the Gerstmann Syndrome); (2) "Parents' Perspective" (early warning signs, do's 
and don'ts); (3) "Diagnosis and Evaluation" (basic rights of parents and 
children, evaluation tools, sources of help); (4) "Teacher's Perspective" 
(recognizing the student with a learning disability); (5) "Developing a Teaching 
Program" (program planning, teaching basic skills, reinforcement techniques); 
(6) "Not Working to Ability"? (retention and the fun of writing); and (7) 
"Creating Successes" (college or vocational training, value of praise, and a 
case study).  (DB)  <BR>

Journal Announcement: RIEMAR84  <BR> 
	The study investigated and recorded changes in selected psychomotor skills 
of an 11-year old gifted male with severe motoric problems identified as 
dysgraphia.  A pre-post test design using videotape evaluation recordings was 
employed to determine changes in psychomotor performance, and a rating scale was 
designed to establish baseline and determine performance changes after 
administration of a sensory motor intervention approach.  The approach featured 
stimulation of vestibular, kinesthetic, tactile, and visual sensory modalities.  
Correlated tests were applied to factor grouped data as measured by a panel of 
six raters, indicating that the S improved significantly in body awareness and 
visual-motor control.  The practical value of single-subject designs is 
emphasized.  (Author/CL)  <BR>
