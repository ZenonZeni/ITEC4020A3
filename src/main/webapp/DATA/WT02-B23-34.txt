<B>Pittsburgh, August 23, 1996</B> Mutual fund software provider
Confluence Technologies announces today an agreement with First
Data Investor Services Group to install FundStation<SUP>&#153;</SUP>.
FundStation is Confluence's PC-based data repository that automatically
collects end-of-day fund and account data, calculates yields and
rates of return, and distributes customized reports, faxes, files
and e-mail. First Data has been using FundStation for its bank
client's mutual fund processing since November 1994.<BR>
<P>
&quot;We've experienced a high degree of success by utilizing
FundStation in our Westboro operation center. It provides us with
a mechanism to distribute information to all of our clients with
increased control and timeliness. After evaluating our options
for fund processing, which included building a similar product
in-house, we determined that expanding the use of FundStation
internally was our best solution,&quot; said Richard A. Silver,
Executive Vice President of Fund Accounting and Administration.
<BR>
<P>
Confluence Technologies' Relationship Manager, Caroline Sussman,
is enthusiastic about this installation. &quot;The industry is
responding to successful reports from FundStation users. First
Data represents a particularly exciting addition to our client
list, since this marks the first time that FundStation will run
out of 2 offices - one in Westboro and one in Boston - using a
Wide Area Network (WAN). We expect to see more of this in the
future, including access from foreign offices.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Confluence Technologies is a Microsoft Solution Provider, a member
of the Pittsburgh High Technology Council and a service member
of the National Investment Company Service Association. <BR>
