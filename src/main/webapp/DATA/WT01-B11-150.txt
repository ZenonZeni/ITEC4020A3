<CENTER><H2>True or False - A Quiz About Rabies</H2></CENTER><BR>

1. <B>A good way to avoid rabies is to avoid direct contact with all wild animals and with unfamiliar domestic animals.</B>

<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
Rabies virus is in the saliva of a rabid animal.  If the saliva enters your body by a bite or a scratch, or if it comes into contact with the moist tissues of your eyes, nose or mouth, you could probably get rabies.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab4.html">If You or a Family Member Has Been Exposed to Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>

2. <B>My cat can get rabies from a raccoon.</B><P>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
A rabid raccoon can give rabies to any mammal, including cats, dogs and people.  Even though cats are household pets, we sometimes forget to have them vaccinated against rabies.  They can then pass rabies on to us.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rabiescat.html">Cats - A Link With Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>

3. <B>We can be sure that only if an animal is foaming at the mouth and attacks people it is rabid.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>
</FORM>
Even if rabies virus is already in the animal it takes time for damage to the brain to cause outward signs, such as the aggressive behaviour of "furious" rabies.  Some other symptoms of rabies might also be paralyzed hind legs which cause the animal to stagger or its head may droop (ref. <A HREF="rab3.html">Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies</A>).  Some rabid animals have no visibal symptoms at all.<P><BR><BR>   

4.<B>Raccoon rabies is not more dangerous than other kinds of rabies.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
All types of rabies are very dangerous and you must get treatment if you suspect you or your pet have been in contact with a rabid animal.  Vaccination protects against all types of rabies.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab1.html">Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts</A>)<P><BR><BR>

5. <B>I can help protect myself against rabies by having my pet vaccinated regularly.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
You should also avoid wild animals or strays and be sure to get medical help immediately if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal.  Unless cats or dogs have been identified as vaccinated against rabies, we can't be sure they're not rabid without special testing.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab1.html">Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts</A> and <A HREF="rab5.html">If You Suspect Your Family Pet Has Been Exposed To Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>




6. <B>An animal that has rabies can be saved by rabies vaccines.</B>

<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>
</FORM>

An unvaccinated animal that has contracted rabies can't be saved.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab3.html">Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>  

7. <B>A person who has been exposed to rabies has to get very painful treatment to survive.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>
</FORM>
A person who has contacted rabies is given five almost painless shots in the arm to counteract the rabies virus.  It is important, however, to get treatment and to begin as soon as possible.  Wash the wound carefully and get medical help.<BR>(ref. <A HREF="rab1.html">Raccoon Rabies -- The Facts</A> and  <A HREF="rab4.html">If You or a Family Member Has Been Exposed to Rabies</A>)<P><BR><BR>



8. <B>Ontario once held the title as Rabies Capital of North America.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>TRUE</SELECT>
</FORM>
Until recently, Ontario had more cases of rabies every year than any Canadian province or U.S. state.  Ontario's program to eliminate arctic fox rabies from the province has reduced the number of cases dramatically so that Ontario's rabies rate is no longer the highest in North America.  The goal is to eliminate fox rabies by the year 2001 (end of the century).<BR>(ref. <A HREF="rab.html">Controlling Fox Rabies in Ontario</A>)<P><BR><BR> 

9. <B>There is nothing we can do to stop raccoon rabies.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>
</FORM>
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources is capturing and vaccinating raccoons and skunks against rabies in areas where raccoon rabies could spread from New York State into Ontario.  People can help by preventing "hitchhiking" raccoons from getting into their boats or trucks or cars in the eastern USA before they leave for Ontario.  Also, Ontario and U.S. scientists are experimenting with a vaccine in a bait that raccoons could eat to immunize themselves against rabies.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rabtvr.html">Trap-Vaccinate-Release Program</A> and <A HREF="rab.html">Controlling Fox Rabies in Ontario</A> and <A HREF="rabconf.html">If Raccoon Rabies is Confirmed in Ontario</A> and <A HREF="rabcont.html">Contingency Planning In Ontario -- A Community Response to the Threat of Raccoon Rabies</A>)<P> <BR><BR>

10. <B>Only people living in rural areas need to worry about rabies.</B>
<FORM METHOD="text">  
<SELECT NAME="answer">
<OPTION>Answer here<OPTION>FALSE</SELECT>
</FORM>
Wildlife in cities encounter our pets and could pass rabies to them.  Unless our pets are vaccinated they could pass rabies on to us.<BR> (ref. <A HREF="rab2.html">Rabies -- Protecting Your Family and Your Pets</A>; <A HREF="rab5.html">If You Suspect Your Family Pet Has Been Exposed to Rabies</A>; <A HREF="rab6.html">Discourage Raccoons From Moving In</A>)<P><BR><BR>
