<h3>Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium</h3><p>

<blockquote>

<B>Project Title: Low Cost Sensorless Drive<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P>Project Goals and Technologies</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>Motor drive for low power auxiliary motors in a vehicle to let them operate without a position/speed sensor. {motors used for air conditioning, power brakes, etc..)
<LI>Develop algorithms to estimate rotor parameters (position, time constant) for optimum efficiency operation.
<LI>Enables use of high efficiency & reliability, low cost AC motors instead of brush DC motors. Parts and labor costs reduced becaus there is no sensor required.
<LI>Eventual goal Is to transfer knowledge to controller for the vehicle's main motor, if it can be made to feel sufficiently smooth. </UL></P>


<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
on­road applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.
</P>

<P>
ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles.
