<H2>More Animals Could Face Extinction

</H2>

 


<P>

Washington, DC:  <A NAME="extinct"></A>Fully a quarter of all known mammal species are at risk of extinction, according to the 1996 <A HREF="http://www.iucn.org/"TARGET="main">IUCN</A> <B>Red List of Threatened Animals</B> – the most comprehensive scientific assessment of threatened species yet produced.  Habitat destruction and other threats are pushing the entire spectrum of Earth’s biodiversity  alarmingly close to the brink.  
	<P>Published by the <A HREF="http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/index.html" TARGET="main">Species Survival Commission</A> (SSC) and CI, the 1996 Red List is the first assessment to mark the conservation status of all known mammals. But the report also contains equally grim estimates on other animals:  11 percent of all known bird species are threatened; 20 percent of reptiles, 25 percent of amphibians, and 34 percent of fish, mostly freshwater species.  
	<P>“This scientific assessment is indisputable proof that warnings about global biological diversity loss haven’t been exaggerated — if anything we’ve been too optimistic,” said Russell A. Mittermeier, CI president and chair of the SSC’s <B>Primate Specialist Group</B>.   “Furthermore, the 1996 List is the first study to use rigorous criteria for assessing the conservation status of species, making these grim findings more defensible than ever before.”
	<P>To produce the 1996 list, 500 scientists, including those from SSC partners <A HREF="http://www.surfnet.fi/birdlife/int/index.html" TARGET="main">BirdLife International</A>, CI, <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org" TARGET="main">The Nature Conservancy</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.wcmc.org.uk/" TARGET="main">World Conservation Monitoring Centre</A>, provided data and carried out assessments.   For the first time, the List has added a “critical” category representing the most endangered of the endangered species—those animals on the edge of extinction. “The Red List is actually a red flag, warning us about the perilous state of animals and drawing attention to threats such as habitat destruction,  pollution, over-harvesting, and  the introduction of non-native species,” said Jorgen Thomsen, CI's Senior Director for Conservation Biology.
	<P>The Red List originated in 1960 as a set of index cards containing information on 34 mammals on file at the SSC Secretariat in London.  In more than three decades, the job of  monitoring the status of the world’s biodiversity has drawn together the SSC volunteer network including more than 7,000 scientists, field researchers, government officials and conservation leaders from 179 countries.


<H3><A NAME="sky"></A>Logging Thousands of Perilous Hours in the Sky for Conservation
</H3>
<P>

Tucson, Arizona:  Pilot Sandy Lanham may have one of the most dangerous jobs in conservation.  Lanham flies more than 30 partners in Mexico, helping them gather data for wetlands and migratory bird research, mountain range and desert surveys, and inventories of marine mammals and other endangered wildlife. “These flights can be fatiguing, and sometimes dangerous,” said Lanham.  “Because we often fly for hours at less than 200 feet above ground or sea level, a momentary lapse of concentration could send us into the cacti of the Sonoran desert.”
	<P>Aviation—an essential conservation tool in remote areas—is usually too costly for researchers in developing countries.  But in Mexico, Lanham is making overflights affordable through her Tucson-based company, <B>Environmental Flying Services</B> (EFS).  Supported by CI and other institutions, Lanham has logged 3000 hours of flying time since 1991 for Mexican wildlife managers and researchers.
  <P>	Lanham, a Michigan native, has been flying for 16 years.  She came up with the idea to start EFS when she was living in Sonora, Mexico in the 1980s.  “I knew the need was great because researchers kept asking for my time,” Lanham said.
	<P>In the <B>Gulf of California</B>, Lanham is assisting Silvia Manvanilla from the Independent University of Mexico to track the position and movements of the vaquita — a rare and elusive porpoise.  Their findings will help determine key threats and the areas most critical for the vaquita’s survival.  Last July, Lanham and Manvanilla made the first-ever vaquita sightings in the Colorado River where it joins the Gulf of California.  Conservationists hope to leverage this finding with policymakers to expand protection for the vaquita.
	<P>Lanham is also helping CI’s Gulf of California program conduct a survey of small fishing boats and fishing camps along 2,000 kilometers of coastline in the gulf—considered one of the richest fisheries in the western hemisphere.  So far, CI has tallied over 10,000 vessels in a series of overflights.  CI will use the census results to pinpoint where the gulf’s resources are most exploited and to determine where to target sustainable use programs.



<H3><A NAME="rap"></A>AquaRAP Races to Explore, Conserve Depths of Aquatic Biodiversity
</H3>
 <P>
Cobija, Bolivia:  Our current understanding of aquatic life barely skims the surface of the vast biodiversity believed to exist underwater. While many terrestrial ecosystems have been studied extensively by biologists, most tropical aquatic ecosystems are still essentially unknown to science.  Despite this lack of information, major decisions threatening rivers and watersheds—such as the construction of hydroelectric dams—are being made throughout the tropics.
<P>To address the critical gap in tropical freshwater biology,  CI and Chicago’s <A HREF="http://www.bvis.uic.edu/museum/" TARGET="main">Field Museum of Natural History</A>, with support from <A HREF="http://www.wajones.org" TARGET="main">W. Alton Jones Foundation</A>, have launched the <B>Aquatic Rapid Assessment Program</B> (AquaRAP).  Like the legendary terrestrial RAP team, the AquaRAP team was set up to conduct fast, but thorough, surveys of freshwater ecosystems throughout the tropics and to recommend to policymakers key areas for protection and management alternatives.
<P>“Rivers depend on one another as well as on the surrounding forest for ecological health,” said Barry Chernoff, a world-renowned ichthyologist with the Field Museum and AquaRAP team leader.  “If one river crashes, or if we cut down the forest, many other rivers can die, too.  The loss of a river will also hurt the forest because many species of plants depend on fishes for seed dispersal and germination.” 
<P>In September, the AquaRAP team made its pilot expedition to Bolivia to look at the basins of the <B>Tahuamanu and Manuripi Rivers</B>.   For four weeks, the team’s 22 scientists from Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, and the United States worked in the rivers and nearby stream, marsh, and swamp habitats with nets and other collection tools to document the area’s fish, aquatic invertebrates, and vegetation and to assess its conservation value.  
<P>“In just four weeks, our team found approximately 250 fish species, which is incredible when we realize that only 400 species have been documented from the entire country,” said Chernoff.  “Clearly, there is wealth of diversity underneath the water surface that we know very little about.”  The scientists also found at least <B>three species never documented</B> before in Bolivia and <B>five species new to science</B>, including a dinosaur-like armored catfish covered in bony plates.
<P>“These findings confirm that the Tahuamanu and Manuripi Rivers  are a significant priority for biodiversity conservation,” said Chernoff.  “We will provide policymakers with information on these discoveries, and suggestions for how to protect and manage  the river basins. We hope they will take our advice  into consideration as they evaluate potentially damaging road-building plans for this area.”
 <P>“Recommendations from this and future AquaRAP surveys will impact  rural communities and indigenous groups across the tropics who depend on fish as their sole source of protein,” said Jorgen Thomsen, CI’s Senior Director for Conservation Biology.  “Right now, fish populations in many areas are falling rapidly because of pollution and overfishing, and local people are without food.”
<P>As part of the pilot mission to Bolivia, AquaRAP scientists developed a standard methodology to assess the biological and conservation value of complex river systems on a continental scale. Because important watersheds often span more than one country, conservation recommendations from AquaRAP expeditions could help catalyze international cooperation on conservation issues.


<H2><A NAME="nasa"></A>CI and NASA Scientists Stumble on Ancient Mayan City</H2>


<P>
The recent discovery of the ruins of “Lo Veremos” in Guatemala’s <B>Laguna del Tigre National Park</B> underscores how unexplored the depths of the rain forest remain. Jim Nations, CI’s Vice President of MesoAmerican Programs, and his colleague Tom Sever from <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov" TARGET="main">NASA</A>, were analyzing data from satellite images of northern Guatemala.  Their goal was to measure the impact of human activities on the region’s habitat over the past ten years.  Instead, they were struck by changes that had occurred at least 1,200 years earlier.
	<P> “Down in the forest, you can’t see the road for the trees,” said Nations.  “But if you’re looking at satellite photos  —  the ruins of ancient Maya cities and the roads that connected them can be traced like a secret code under the forest cover.”   That’s why Nations and Sever are calling this major archaeological site, “Lo Veremos,” (‘we will see it’).
	<P>Mayan burial mounds and small ruins are sprinkled through the lowland tropical forests of northern Guatemala and southern Mexico.  “The legacy of  Maya culture is evident throughout the region,” Nations said.  “But  Lo Veremos could be an especially significant link in Maya archaeological studies.  Intriguing findings here of ancient Maya glyphs, the remains of walls and water reservoirs—even boat docks—all could shed light on some of the mysteries of Maya culture.” 
	<P>CI staff have registered the site with <B>Guatemala’s Ministry of Archeology</B>,  although it may be years before archaeologists excavate the ruins.
	<P>For the people of nearby Carmelita, Lo Veremos is a potential attraction for ecotourists who are drawn to the region to see the world-famous ruins of Tikal and the scenic beauty of the Maya Biosphere Reserve.  Communities in and around the reserve are especially eager to develop sites because ecotourism has brought money into their communities.  “Through projects like <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/guatemal.htm">CI’s Scarlet Macaw Trail</A>, people here have seen that preserving their cultural heritage and local habitats can alter the economy without altering the landscape,” said Nations.  “We need more incentives like Lo Veremos to encourage local conservation.”   



<H3><A NAME="cheetah"></A>World Cheetah Population at All Time Low</H3>
<P>


Washington, DC:  The cheetah—the fastest animal on four legs—is also one of Earth’s most endangered mammals.  According to <B>Namibia’s Cheetah Conservation Fund</B> (CCF), Africa’s cheetah population is currently less than 15,000, down from about 100,000 in 1900.  Less than 200 cheetahs remain in Iran, representing the last of the Asian cheetahs.
	<P>About 10,000 years ago, the species went through a population “bottleneck”—an extreme population reduction and subsequent rebound through inbreeding.   This event dramatically reduced the amount of genetic variation in the species, making the cheetah highly susceptible to ecological and environmental changes today. 
	<P>Recent actions of humans have worsened the cheetah’s vulnerable condition.  The most significant human threat to the cheetah’s survival is habitat destruction, which has reduced the amount of available prey and caused fatal conflicts with domestic livestock and livestock farmers.  In Namibia alone, humans have killed or removed nearly 7,000 cheetahs between 1980 and 1991 because of perceived attacks on livestock. 
	<P>Research to better understand ecological threats is integral to maintaining endangered species like the cheetah.   As part of our research efforts, CI has supported studies by the CCF to determine the distribution of and risks to cheetahs in Botswana.   
	

<H3>Guatemalan Community Reaches<BR>
Milestone with EcoEscuela</H3>
<P>


San Andres, Guatemala:  More than 50 teachers and house mothers working with the <A HREF="../../fieldact/ecoescue/ecoescue.htm">EcoEscuela</A> stood proudly in front of hundreds of community members and invited guests for a press event this fall to mark a major milestone in the social and economic development of the town—independence of the EcoEscuela.
	<P>The EcoEscuela is a school in <B>San Andres</B> offering Spanish language and environmental education to foreigners.  In 1993 CI and the community launched this school as an economic alternative to destructive land uses in the neighboring Maya Biosphere Reserve.  Since then, EcoEscuela has boosted commitment to conservation in San Andres by providing the project’s anfitriones—house mothers that host students—and teachers with reliable family income dependent  on standing forest.  Now the staff—following three years of hard work—have formed a corporation to take over EcoEscuela as an independent, locally managed organization.
	<P>“We are proud of EcoEscuela and what it has done for our community,” said one house mother.  “It is helping us preserve a healthy environment and economy for our children.  This is why we have taken EcoEscuela into our own hands.”
	<P>The house mothers and teachers, while not legal owners of EcoEscuela until now, have demonstrated a strong spirit of ownership in the school since its inception.  Meanwhile CI provided training in a range of skills from language instruction to business management to writing marketing plans.
	<P>The local environmental commitment fostered by EcoEscuela has had a critical ripple effect on regional political attitudes.  For example, when cattle owned by a local rancher encroached upon the school’s ecological preserve, house mothers—concerned about potential impacts on the community and the environment—organized a group to alert the municipal government of the situation.  The result was an official order to the rancher to remove his cattle from the area. 
	<P>The work ethic of the community members was instrumental in the school’s transformation into an economically viable, self-sufficient institution.  Between 1993 and 1996 annual student attendance grew from about 100 to over 500, and the staff launched several community conservation programs—including a reforestation project and an interpretive nature trail. 
	<P>By providing employment for 60 families and stimulating business for local restaurants, stores, and ecotourism, the school’s success has helped convince the municipal government of San Andres that conservation makes economic sense.
