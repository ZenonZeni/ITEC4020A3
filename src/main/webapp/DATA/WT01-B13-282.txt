Mutual fund investors who worked with a professional financial
representative have reaped greater rewards!
<BR><BR>

A well-chosen group of mutual funds can make an excellent cornerstone
for a results-oriented investment portfolio. And, studies have shown
that investors who use professional financial representatives - taking
advantage of their experience and guidance - have achieved better
results than investors who chose to go it alone.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>See for yourself...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

A study of 1,000 equity and fixed income mutual funds showed that
investors who bought funds through a professional financial
representative had better investment results than those who purchased
funds themselves - 15% better in equity funds and 9% better in fixed
income funds.*

results. Also, there can be no guarantee that a particular investor's
results will be improved through professional advice. The study compared
cumulative investment returns over the period 12/31/92 to 12/30/94 for a
wide variety of equity and fixed income funds sold directly to investors
and sold through financial representatives. Performance information does
not consider the effect of sales charges paid by investors who worked
with financial representatives. Source of investment information was the

<STRONG>
Here's how your financial representative's experience and guidance can
help provide this exceptional benefit...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Encouragement to stay the course.</STRONG> A long-term perspective is one of the
best predictors of financial success. And, because studies have shown
that investors who worked with a professional financial representative
held their mutual fund investments longer than those who did not (3.2
vs. 2 years respectively for equity funds, and 2.9 vs. 1.7 years for
fixed income funds)** - they may have greater potential for success in
the long-run. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Information about emerging opportunities.</STRONG> As an investment professional,
it's your financial representative's job to stay abreast of (and let you
know about) new investment opportunities. On the other hand, an investor
working alone would have to do lots of homework, including reading a
variety of financial publications and investment newsletters, to gain
timely awareness of such opportunities.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Advice when it's time to move.</STRONG> Should you move quickly to take advantage
of a new opportunity? Or should you stick with your current investments?
With a professional financial representative at your side, you can be
confident that you're making educated choices based on time-tested
experience. And that's the best feeling of all.
