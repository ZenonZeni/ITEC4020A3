<P>

I've received some complaints that this survey is overly polarized towards 
one side or the other - let me say that this is done for a specific reason.  It
goes without saying that most people will always choose "in-between" if they
have that as a choice - but it proves nothing.  When you are confronted with
a question covering two opposed concepts, in lieu of the ideal answer (which
is utterly impossible to list for everyone), choose the BEST choice and not
whine about your ideal thoughts not being summed up in one of the multiple
choice answers.  <I>Hey, it's sorta like real life don't ya think?</I><BR>
  Thanks - Ed.
