<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Six Retirement Myths</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Like many people, you may have thought about retirement planning without
actually doing as much as you'd like
to
do - at least not yet.  Even if you have been preparing financially and have
amassed what you think is an adequate
retirement income, think again.  Often, people will base their retirement estimates
on several mistaken, but
commonly-held, assumptions regarding retirement and various resources.  In many
cases, the reality of retirement
turns out to be quite different from what these common "retirement myths" would
lead one to believe.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 1:  I'll Have Social Security to Support Me</STRONG><BR>
	Social Security was never designed to cover income needs, but rather to
supplement your pension and personal
savings.  Here's an idea of what you can expect from Social Security:  if your
annual earnings are $25,000, $40,000,
or $60,000 in 1996, Social Security can provide 50%, 27%, or 23% of your annual income,
respectively.<P>
	At least, that's what you can expect if you retire now.  However, some experts
have estimated that by the time
today's
working baby boomers are ready to retire next century, there may not be enough
people left in the work force to fund
Social Security benefits.  That's all the more reason to look into building up your
retirement savings.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 2: My Living Costs Will be Lower When I Retire, so I'll Need Less
Money</STRONG><BR>
	Many times, just the opposite is true.  The only costs that may end are
mortgage payments and the college tuition
you may now be paying.  Health care costs could rise, especially if you no longer
have employer-sponsored
medical/dental coverage.  Also, if, like many retirees, you'll eat out frequently,
you could increase your food bills.  And
you'll probably want to pursue your favorite hobbies, recreational activities, and
"dream" vacations.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 3: I'll Have My Company Pension to Tide Me Over</STRONG><BR>
	Don't count on a pension as your main source of income.  Most defined benefit
plans are geared toward
providing a
replacement ratio of between 40% - 60% of your final average salary.  This amount
generally will be paid only if the
employee has twenty-five or more years of service with the employer.  Also, defined
benefit pensions are often
reduced for payments to Social Security.  Under typical circumstances, the actual
replacement ratio can drop to
between twenty and thirty percent of the final average salary for a rank and file
employee.<P>
	Naturally, each situation is different.  But many retirees have made the
mistake of counting on their pension, only
to
have to find part-time jobs to pay the bills.  With the right planning, this won't
happen to you.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 4:  I'm Too Old to Begin Planning for Retirement Now</STRONG><BR>
	Maybe you can't make up for lost time and opportunity, but it's never too late
to start saving.  Someone who takes
early retirement at age fifty-five may still be going strong for the next thirty
years.  While you'll have to contribute
more to your retirement savings account than if you had started earlier, you can
still be ready for your retirement  if you
start now, and do what needs to be done.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 5:  The Equity in My Home is My Retirement Fund</STRONG><BR>
	While a house may be your largest investment, residential real estate does not
always appreciate.  Even when
home prices do rise, they usually increase along with all other living expenses. 
Even if you sell and move to a
smaller home, after paying capital gains taxes, you may wind up with far less money
than you expected.  And, when
all your savings have been depleted, you can't sell your house, piece by piece, in
order to eat.  That's why it's
important to have liquid assets that will be there when you need them.
<P>
<STRONG>Myth 6:  My Main Goal Should be to Preserve My Savings</STRONG><BR>
	Inflation is a money-killer, and it will deplete your principal.  To stay ahead
of inflation, you shouldn't seek to
preserve money, but to build on it.  Did you know that a retirement income of
$20,000 in 1970 would have to increase
to $67,000 in 1990 to have the same purchasing power?  A solid financial plan
allows your assets to grow, so that you
can keep up with the rising cost of living.<P>
