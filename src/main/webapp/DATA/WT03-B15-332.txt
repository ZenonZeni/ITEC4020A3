</b></center>

BOISE -- Major General Pat Stevens IV, a 33-year veteran of the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers who last served as Deputy and Acting Chief of 
Engineers, has joined Morrison Knudsen Corporation as Vice President and 
Director of Worldwide Military Services.<P>
     Stevens, who retired from the Corps in October, had overall 
responsibility for the Corps' 40,000 people and $11 billion program during 
his final Army assignment.<P>
     "During his distinguished military career, Major Gen. Stevens 
demonstrated leadership and management skills that took him to the top of 
the Corps of Engineers," said Robert A. Tinstman, MK President and Chief 
Executive Officer. "His experience and talents will be invaluable as he 
helps MK become the military's support contractor of choice on military 
projects of all kinds, throughout the world." Tinstman said Stevens will 
be based at MK's Washington D.C. office.<P>
     Prior to his promotion to Deputy Chief Engineer of the Corps, Stevens 
served as Director of Military Programs, with responsibility for design, 
construction and environmental cleanup projects worldwide.  During his 
three years in that position, he programmed, scheduled and managed some
$16 billion of work.<p>
     During Operation Desert Storm, Stevens served as a principal staff  
officer to Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf as Deputy Director for Logistics and 
Host Nation Support. He then served as Division Engineer, Lower 
Mississippi Valley Division, and President of the Mississippi River 
Commission.<p>
     During his military career, Stevens was assigned to Thailand, 
Vietnam, Australia, Oman and Saudi Arabia and supervised projects in 
several other countries.<p>
     He graduated with distinction from the United States Military Academy 
with a degree in engineering and later earned a master's in engineering 
astrodynamics from the University of California at Los Angeles.<p>
     Morrison Knudsen has been providing engineering, construction and 
support services to the military for over 50 years. Today, MK is a leading 
contractor for chemical demilitarization and other Cooperative Threat 
Reduction programs in the former Soviet Union and is a major provider of 
environmental cleanup and restoration services to the Navy and Army Corps 
of Engineers at numerous locations throughout the U.S.
