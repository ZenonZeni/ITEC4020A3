<H3>From the Prodigy Service Agreement:</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>7. Information Supplied to Prodigy by Members</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
One of the valuable and unique features of the Service is its ability to
personalize editorial and commercial content and offerings to your interests.
Personalization is based on information that you (or the Membership Holder)
provide to Prodigy and information derived during your use of the Service
and during installation of the PRODIGY software on your equipment used to
receive the Service. You may review or update certain personal information
you have provided to Prodigy by using the Tools feature on the Service.
Jump: tools.<BR>
<BR>
You may be requested to supplement or update your personal information from
time to time. All personal information that you provide on the Service must
be accurate, and Prodigy reserves the right to verify its accuracy. Prodigy
may use or disclose aggregated (not personally identifiable) information
regarding Members for any purpose. Prodigy will not use or disclose information
specifically about you (or your Membership) except as permitted by this
Agreement and Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
Jump: privacy policy. <BR>
<BR>
From time to time, Prodigy may record information about your computer, communications
equipment and operating system software (but no other nonPRODIGY software).
Prodigy will use this information on an individually identifiable basis
only to: (i) analyze how current or future Service features may operate
on your equipment; (ii) monitor or improve the performance of the PRODIGY
software on your equipment; or (iii) tell you about enhancements and offerings
that may become available for your equipment. When you place an order on
the Service, Prodigy may provide your name, address, telephone number, and
other relevant information to the Merchant, including whether you are a
minor and how long you have been a Member. Prodigy cannot and will not be
responsible for how Merchants use this information. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy<BR>
(&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;)</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Company
is committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,
by maintaining the very highest privacy standards.<BR>
<BR>
Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*
[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that is
associated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both information
supplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and information
we collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact that
a Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through the
service). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total number
of Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Member
has made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY service
as a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal files
on their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standards
which meet these expectations.<BR>
<BR>
We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policy
on Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodying
our privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamental
to our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provide
Prodigy's products and services.<BR>
<BR>
These purposes are: <BR>
<BR>
- to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, and
service providers on the PRODIGY service;<BR>
- to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, including
making members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercial
offerings that may be of interest;<BR>
- to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings;<BR>
- to serve members when they have questions or problems;<BR>
- to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, and
accounting;<BR>
- to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;
and<BR>
- as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy's
legal department in each case.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID ends
in &quot;A&quot;) information regarding service usage by other Membership
ID's to document Prodigy's invoices or other matters for which the Membership
Holder is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
2. Prodigy uses strict procedures and safeguards designed to protect the
privacy of all personal information. All Prodigy employees with access to
personal information are required to follow specific practices concerning
its proper handling.<BR>
<BR>
3. Prodigy does not rent, sell, barter, or give away its member list for
use by any outside party. Prodigy may send approved commercial communications
to members on behalf of outside parties, but will do so only through the
PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
4. Prodigy keeps the private messages that its members send to other members,
advertisers, or merchants absolutely private. Prodigy also keeps members'
private messages sent to or from other systems absolutely private while
they are under Prodigy's control. Prodigy employees never inspect or disclose
to others the contents of these private messages except with the specific
consent of the sender or recipient, or as specifically authorized by Prodigy's
legal department in the narrowly-defined situations established under federal
law.<BR>
<BR>
5. Prodigy respects the privacy of personal files in members' computers.
Prodigy does not access, read, upload, or store data contained in or derived
from private files without the member's authorization.<BR>
<BR>
Each Prodigy Services Company employee is required to abide by and uphold
this Policy, and to take responsibility for enforcing it.<A NAME="opt_out"></A><BR>

<HR>
<H2><CENTER>Opt Out of Commercial Promotional Mail</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Prodigy's online advertisers often send mail about specials, one-of-a-kind
sales and limited-time promotions they don't want you to miss. <BR>
<BR>
We hope you find this information useful. But it's your mailbox, and your
choice. If you prefer, select Take Me Off the List to stop receiving this
type of mail. You'll still get information about Prodigy features, pricing
changes and your account, but all advertiser mail will be suppressed. Or,
choose Keep Me On the List to continue receiving special offers and Prodigy
news in your mailbox. <BR>
<BR>
To return here anytime, Jump: opt out. <BR>
