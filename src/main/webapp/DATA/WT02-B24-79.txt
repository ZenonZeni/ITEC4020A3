<b><font SIZE="+1">Attentional Deficits </font></b><br>
The term "attentional disorders" is used to characterize children with 
a varying constellation of short attention span, impulsivity, 
distractibility, and sometimes hyperactivity (unusually high level of 
activity) or hypoactivity (underactivity). Children with attentional 
disorders frequently exhibit difficulties with both their attention 
and behavior that can interfere with their classroom performance. The 
terminology for attentional disorders is constantly changing, to the 
confusion and consternation of <em>both</em> parents and professionals. 
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Disorder with 
Hyperactivity (ADHD), ADD-combined type, ADD-predominantly 
inattentive type, ADD-predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, 
Executive Function Disorder, and Primary Disorder of Vigilance are 
just some of the terms that clinicians and researchers use. The major 
areas of intervention used with children exhibiting attention deficit 
disorders include: classroom accommodations, behavior management 
counseling for the family, and possibly medication. Between fifty 
and seventy-five percent of children with attentional deficits also 
have learning disabilities; it is important to keep in mind that 
each will benefit from being specifically and separately addressed.

<p>Often, children with attention deficit disorders exhibit notable 
hyperactivity. Diagnosis of such hyperactivity is separate and not 
necessarily a part of all attention deficit disorders. According to 
current data, males seem more likely to exhibit hyperactivity early 
on in their school career; females are more likely to have 
attentional problems without hyperactivity early on and then show 
behavioral and emotional problems in middle to late adolescence. 
Girls with both mild attentional and learning disabilities are more 
likely to withdraw, try harder to compensate, and successfully keep 
their problem concealed, perhaps later developing psychological 
problems as the cost of this compensation.

<p>Although LD and attention deficit disorders are commonly related, 
early identification of attentional disorders may or may not help the 
identification of associated learning disabilities depending on 
whether or not one disorder masks the other. It may be of interest 
to physicians, teachers, and administrators to note that children 
referred to a health professional because the child is having 
"staring spells" in class are much more likely to have attentional 
problems than petit mal seizures (commonly assumed to be the primary 
cause of "staring spells").

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Physical Disabilities</font></b><br>
Physical disabilities can lead directly to educational problems as 
well. Children with visual impairment require ophthalmological 
assessments and eyeglasses; children with hearing impairment need 
audiological assessment, otolaryngological evaluations) and possibly 
hearing aids or other assistive listening devices. Both of these 
groups of children will also benefit from single classroom 
accommodations (such as preferential seating) that take into account 
their sensory disabilities.

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Language Disabilities</font></b><br>
A language disorder may involve the form of language (phonology, 
morphology, syntax , the content of language (semantics) and/or the 
function of language (semantics) and affect spoken, written and/or 
other symbol systems Children may experience educational difficulty 
as a result of language disorders (developmental disorders related 
to language, i.e., expressive language and/or receptive language 
problems) as well. For such children, the discipline of speech-language 
pathology has developed a number of intervention techniques that can 
effectively be used to assess and treat their specific disability. 
For more information, contact the American Speech-Language-Hearing 
Association.

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Brain Tumors</font></b><br>
Even more severe among physiological disorders, brain tumors may 
occasionally cause children who develop them to display learning 
problems at school In this case, educational difficulty may be 
symptomatic of a critical illness. In fact, in the case of a tumor, 
a careful documentation of academic deterioration may provide the 
earliest clue to what may very well be a life-threatening situation. 
Although rare, brain tumors highlight the need to take a serious 
approach to diagnosing the underlying causes of educational failure. 
If the child's learning difficulties are passed off as motivational, 
the resulting  failure to assess the child might delay a serious 
medical diagnosis in a case where time is critical to long-term 
survival. Similarly, children with degenerative diseases of the 
central nervous system may first evidence  academic problems. As 
with brain tumors, a careful medical assessment will be needed to 
make an accurate diagnosis and determine whether academic 
difficulties are the result of  a  serious and worsening system 
disorder.

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Emotional Disorders</font></b><br>
Like physical impairments, emotional and psychosocial problems can 
have a serious effect on a child's ability to learn. Similarly, too, 
these causes of educational failure have their own fields of 
diagnosis and treatment; and, -- as mentioned earlier -- although 
these difficulties are not necessarily associated with LD, they 
commonly co-occur in learning disabled children. For children 
exhibiting any of a variety of different emotional diagnoses, there 
exists a range of professional psychological counseling and medical 
psychotherapy. In addition, emotional problems may be treated with 
medications (psychopharmacologicals). Unlike some other disorders 
that cause educational problems, major psychiatric conditions are 
not treatable through minor classroom accommodations and are probably 
beyond the typical experience of school counselors.
