				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Kassandra Mines complex is located on the east coast of the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximatety 100 kilometres east of Thessaloniki, the country's second largest city. The property covers 31,400 hectares and includes three mines, base metal milling facilities and a ship-loading facility on the Aegean Sea.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/Kassandra5.jpg" ALT="Kassandra Mine" ALIGN=right WIDTH=283 HEIGHT=218 BORDER=0>TVX Gold was named the successful bidder for Kassandra Mines in March 1995, pursuant to an international auction. Discussions to advance the completion of the transaction continued throughout the remainder of the year, and engineering, procurement and environmental work were initiated in anticipation of the closing which occured on December 21, 1995.
<P>The Company purchased the Kassandra Mines assets for approximately $46 million, with $19 million paid on closing, and five equal installments of approximately $5.5 million, plus interest, payable on the anniversary dates of the closing.
<P>TVX Gold made its bid for Kassandra Mines after its studies showed that the current silver-lead-zinc operation could be rehabilitated to include an efficient and economic gold operation. Although the deposits have been mined for over 30 years, the gold content of the ore had not been exploited because of its refractory nature. By incorporating pressure oxidation technology into the ore processing phase, TVX Gold expects to achieve gold recoveries in excess of 90%.
<P>The cost of construction of a gold plant and modernization of the existing operation is currently estimated to be approximately $285 million, to be spent over the initial two years of the project. A portion of this amount will be allocated to the enhancement and modernization of the existing mining and milling operations, and will include environmental rehabilitation. The balance relates to the construction of the gold plant, which is expected to start up within two years from receipt of all relevant licences and permits. Full capacity is estimated to be in excess of 300,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually during the initial years of operation, tapering thereafter to approximately 200,000 ounces annually. Significant grants have been made available for the Kassandra Mines project by the Greek government. The Greek government approved, subject to Parliamentary ratification, grants to the project of 35% of eligible capital expenditures. Under the original grant application this constitutes approximately $69 million. The purchase contract provides assurances from the Greek government to TVX Gold of its cooperation to ensure timely issuance of all the necessary licences and project approvals and the early approval and implementation of grants to the maximum degree possible.
<P><IMG SRC="/images/Kassandra3.jpg" ALT="Kassandra Mine" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=167 BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>The Kassandra orebodies are massive sulphide stratabound replacement deposits, and occur within marble layers interbedded with gneiss and amphibolite in the Kerdyllia formation of the Serbo-Macedonian massif, a series of Paleozoic and older rocks. Gold mineralization in the Olympias deposit is associated with arsenopyrite and pyrite. The deposit consists of two zones. The west zone is lensoid in shape, averages 11 metres in thickness, 350 metres along strike and 1,500 metres down dip, and occurs on the west flank of an anticline. The east deposit, 300 metres distant, is arc-shaped, averages nine metres in thickness, 250 metres along strike and 550 metres down dip.
<P>The smaller Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres deposits are skarn deposits, and occur in or at the contact of marble layers with the overlying schists and gneiss. Sulphides are primarily galena, sphalerite and pyrite, and also arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, tennantite-tetrahedrite and a wide range of other metallic minerals.
<P>Indicated reserves at Kassandra Mines are reported to be approximately 17.7 million tonnes grading 5.8 grams of gold per tonne (approximately 3.4 million ounces), 100 grams of silver per tonne (approximately 800,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3.6% lead and 4.8% zinc.
<P>The Madem Lakkos mine is accessed by a 315-metre shaft and uses the retreat undercut-and-fill mining method. An adit provides access to the Mavres Petres mine, which also uses an undercut-and-fill mining method. Ore from both of these mines is delivered to the Stratoni mill. This 1,200 tonnes per day plant incorporates two flotation circuits and produces lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates, averaging 70% lead and 53% zinc. TVX Gold proposes a number of modifications to improve efficiencies and recoveries at this mill, as well as replacing equipment which is reaching the end of its useful life. It is expected that the Stratoni mill rehabilitation will be completed and recommence operation by the end of the first quarter, 1996.
<P><IMG SRC="/images/Kassandra7.jpg" ALT="Kassandra" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=147 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT>The Olympias mine is accessed by a 300-metre shaft and two declines and uses undercut-and-fill and blasthole retreat stoping methods to mine the ore. For this operation TVX Gold proposes the use of longhole mining with pastefill as the main mining method in the future. Olympias ore is delivered to the Olympias mill, which is similar to the Stratoni plant. Plans are in place to upgrade this mill. The gold plant will treat refractory ore primarily from the Olympias mine. Power for the new plant will be supplied by constructing a 24-kilometre transmission line from the national power grid at Stagira.
<P>Additional potential on the Kassandra property includes the Skouries copper/gold porphyry deposit, estimated to contain 72 million tonnes averaging 0.5% copper and 0.7 grams of gold per tonne.
