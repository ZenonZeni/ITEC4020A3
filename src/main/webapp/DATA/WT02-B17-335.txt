<TR><TD valign=top><H2>Blue Giants of the Neotropics</H2>

<P>Washington, DC:  Blue morpho butterflies verge on the otherworldly as they flutter through the air, flaunting their large blue wings.  Commonly found in rain forests throughout the Neotropics, several blue morpho species thrive in Mexico's Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve.  But the remarkable diversity of butterflies and other wildlife in Montes Azules -- researchers have identified 500 butterfly species alone in the region around CI's Chajul Biological Station -- is jeopardized by deforestation for traditional agriculture and cattle ranching.  CI is working with communities around Chajul to develop feasible economic alternatives, including a butterfly-farming enterprise that increases butterfly populations and provides income to families who would otherwise clear forest for cornfields and cattle.

<P><H3>New CI Staff Member to Launch <BR>Monitoring and Evaluation Program
</H3>
<P>Washington, DC:  Jorgen Thomsen, CI's new Senior Director for
Conservation Biology, is launching an organization-wide Monitoring
and Evaluation Program--a standardized ecosystem-monitoring system
that can measure success or shortcomings of biodiversity
conservation work across the globe.  The first such universal
system developed by any conservation organization, monitoring and
evaluation will be a boon for all CI field programs as it helps
them to continually refine community-based projects and make
optimal use of limited conservation dollars.  A seasoned
conservationist from Denmark, Thomsen has held prominent positions
in numerous international conservation organizations, including
World Wildlife Fund and TRAFFIC International and brings with him
important alliances/affiliations in the European conservation
community.




<P><H3>Cyclone Destroys CI Project <BR>Site, Relief Underway</H3>



Fenerive, Madagascar:  In January, a violent cyclone swept through
Madagascar's Zahamena Nature Reserve, devastating local communities
where CI works.  The strongest cyclone to hit these villages in 20
years, the storm completely destroyed schools, agricultural sites,
over 50 percent of the homes, as well as a CI office in the nearby
town of Fenerive.  CI, the only NGO with an ongoing program in the
area, has been working with relief organizations, including CARE,
to rebuild homes and provide emergency food and health care.

<P>

     "The storm will push back our work at least three months, but
will not diminish CI's high level of commitment in the region,"
said Leon Rajaobelina, CI's Madagascar Program Executive Director. 
"We're committed to helping these communities get back on their
feet." 

<P>

     CI's work in Zahamena focuses on the greatest human threat to
the rich flora and fauna of the reserve:  agricultural development. 
For subsistence reasons, local people slash-and-burn forests
predominantly for rice production--a practice that has caused
widespread erosion and watershed damage along the region's hilly
terrain.  CI is working with these communities to implement local
economic alternatives to forest destruction and to provide health
care services.

<H3><A NAME="fence"></A>New Cattle Fences Lock Out Wildlife in Botswana</H3>

     Gaborone, Botswana:  The government of Botswana has recently built three major
"emergency" cattle fences across one of the country's last wilderness areas in an attempt to contain
an outbreak of lung disease in cattle.  The fences--stretching across a region from the western edge
of the Okavango Delta to the Namibian border--were constructed without environmental impact
assessments or consultation with the local people.  Conservationists fear the new fences could restrict
migration of Botswana's wildlife populations.

<P>
     There is a growing body of evidence that the expansion of Botswana's network of cattle
fences might be linked to declines in the country's wildlife population over the same period.  Since
the 1950s, over 2,000 miles of fences have been built throughout the country to comply with health
standards set by the European Community on all imported beef.
     Today, the Botswana landscape is a web of fences that have interrupted the migration routes
of once nomadic wildlife populations.  In 1983, an estimated 50,000 wildebeest died from dehydration
and starvation along a fence in the Central Kalahari region, unable to reach water and forage on the
other side.  Decreasing wildlife populations in Botswana's ecologically sensitive Okavango Delta --
one of the world's last great landlocked wetlands -- are also of particular concern:  in the past two
decades, buffalo and zebra populations in the region have declined by 60 and 30 percent, respectively.
 <P>    
     "CI is concerned with these developments," said Karen Ross, Director of CI's Okavango Delta
Program. "Further fences could severely restrict remaining wildlife corridors connecting to Namibia
and Angola, jeopardizing the delta's wildlife heritage.  We are in a close dialogue with the
government and NGOs to find a sustainable balance between cattle ranching and wildlife protection." 
    
<P> In a disturbing parallel to the recent mad cow disease crisis in Britain, the government ordered
the extermination of hundreds of thousands of cattle in northern Botswana when three new fences
failed to stop the disease's spread.  Despite the ineffectiveness of the fences, the government has
authorized their permanent status as "veterinary cordon" fences.

<TD valign=top><H3>Neotropical Birds Offers <BR>New Insights On Ecosystems</H3>

<P>Neotropical Birds: Ecology and Conservation, by Douglas F. Stotz,
John W. Fitzpatrick, Theodore A. Parker III, and Debra K.
Moskovits, compiles, for the first time, extensive data on the
ecological and geographical distributions of all 4,037 bird species
from Mexico south to Tierra del Fuego.  From this information,
presented in almost 300 pages of tables, the authors have analyzed
priorities for conservation in the Neotropics, showing how bird
communities help determine which regions and habitats are in most
urgent need of protection.  As top conservation priorities,
Neotropical Birds points to the biological communities found in the
lower slopes of the Andes, the tropical deciduous forests, and to
once-extensive grasslands and scrubs of central Brazil --
communities facing the most immediate threats from development.

<P>
     Much of the previously unpublished information gathered in
this volume was collected by ornithologist Ted Parker, director of
CI's Rapid Assessment Program, before his untimely death in 1993. 
Stotz, Fitzpatrick, Parker, and Moskovits worked in closely
collaboration with CI during the eight-year development of this
project.

<P><H3>Campaigning to Protect <BR>Peru's "Land of Butterflies"</H3>



Lima, Peru: In February, CI premiered its documentary film, "Volver
a Tambopata," as part of its public awareness campaign for the
country's biological treasure, the Tambopata-Candamo region.  For
years, CI has been working with Peruvian institutions to leverage
support for the creation of a national park in Tambopata. The
campaign will help create momentum for the formal recognition of
the park.

<P>
     "Volver a Tambopata"("Return to Tampota") was produced by CI
and supported by Xerox and Citibank, which partially funded the
production.  The largest national television network, Panamericana
TV, ran the documentary in a prime-time spot, obtaining a first-place rating with over three million viewers.  "In just a few
weeks, millions of Peruvians learned about the importance of
Tambopata, many of whom had never heard of this critical region
before," said Haroldo Castro, CI's Senior Director of International
Communications.  CI is distributing the film to NGOs, government
agencies, and schools throughout Peru.
     
<P>
Tambopata is strategically located in the heart of a potential
conservation "mega-corridor" that would link protected areas in
Peru with those in Bolivia, including the recently declared Madidi
National Park (see NFF 1:2).  Tambopata has the highest recorded
number of bird, butterfly, and ant species in the world.  In a five
square-kilometer area of Tambopata, which means "land of
butterflies" in the regional Quechua language, one biologist
identified 1,200 butterfly species.
<P>   

CI-Peru's strategy in Tambopata has been two-fold:  to conduct
extensive ecological and social studies in Tambopata, and to lobby
intensively with NGOs to influence national environmental policy
and leverage support of the park's creation.  In a 1994 expedition
to the region, CI's RAP team found Tambopata to be unique in its
diversity of habitats, resulting in its enormous richness of
species.  Based on their results, RAP scientists have recommended
to the Peruvian government the creation of the Bahuaja-Sonene
National Park within the Tampopata reserve.  CI's socio-economic
research in Tambopata has helped us assess current and potential
land uses and to better understand the threats to the region's
biodiversity, particularly that of agricultural expansion. 


<P>
<H3><A NAME="president"></A>Brazilian President Pledges <BR>Support of CI mission
</H3>
<P>In a recent meeting with CI staff and board members, Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso pledged to assume a leadership
role in international biodiversity conservation and expressed his
strong support of CI's work.  The CI group emphasized to Cardoso
that Brazil is in an ideal position to take on this challenge--given both its biological wealth and the fact that it is one of the
world's major economic powers.  "Cardoso is committed to using his
influence among Latin American leaders to champion conservation
work in South American and elsewhere," said Peter Seligmann, CI's
Chairman of the Board and CEO.  "He is well aware that his
continent's vast biological resources are perhaps its greatest
economic asset."

<P>
     To begin articulating this leadership role, Cardoso is
supporting an innovative infrastructure project conceived by CI
board member Eliezer Batista, which is designed to integrate
biodiversity conservation with long-term development plans in South
America.  Cardoso also will advance a proposal for a bi-national
peace park with the Peruvian and Ecuadorian presidents for their
disputed border region, the Cordillera del Condor, identified by CI
as a critical priority ecosystem (see NFF 1:1).  To broaden support
for conservation in Brazil, Cordoso will work to stimulate private
sector investment in ecologically sustainable projects in the
country.  

<P>

  "Cardoso is very interested in building a 'south-south' dialogue
among Latin American nations on urgent regional issues," "He is
well aware that the countries' vast biological resources are
perhaps their greatest economic asset."


<P>
<H3>New Park A Cross-Border Conservation Victory
</H3>
<P>Guatemala City, Guatemala:  On November 9, 1995, Guatemala declared
the Chiquibul Biosphere Reserve -- a milestone in Central American
cross-border conservation.  The 83,000-hectare park connects with
Belize's Chiquibul National Park and Forest Reserve, creating a key
conservation link between the Maya Tropical Reserve and the Maya
Mountains of Belize.  A socioeconomic study of regional
communities, supported by Conservation International and the
Prospect Hill Foundation, was a major factor in the park's
creation.  The study recommended the region's protection based on
findings of growing colonization rates and environmentally
destructive land uses.
<P>

     Days after Guatemala's announcement, CI convened a ground-breaking summit of government officials, NGOs, and field scientists
from both countries -- the first of its kind -- that set the
foundation for joint management of both parks and the regional
watershed they contain. "These events are crucial given the
historic tension between the two countries," said James Nations, CI
Vice President for Mexico and Central America. "To protect the park
from the threats of an ever-increasing human population, CI will
continue to work with both governments, NGOs, and local communities
to develop sustainable enterprises and land-use plans."
