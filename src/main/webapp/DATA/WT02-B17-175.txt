<P>
The Department of Energy, and the Biomass Power Program in particular,
would like to express its sincere appreciation to the numerous
industry representatives visited during the Biomass Power Assessment
tour.  The representatives freely gave of their time and provided
observations and recommendations to the Department without hesitation.
 This input helped build a strong foundation for the future direction
of the program.  The Department of Energy will continue this critical
dialogue and maintain close contact with the industry.  The Biomass
Power Program would further like to thank the Antares Group for
its support and commitment to this project.
