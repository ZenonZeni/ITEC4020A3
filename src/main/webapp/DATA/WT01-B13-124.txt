<I>Will Investors Or the Government Benefit From Inflation Adjusted Treasury Bonds? (continued)</I><BR>
<P>
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand followed Britain's lead by
introducing index linked debt during the 1980's and early 1990's,
but their stock of index linked debt is much smaller than Britain's
both in absolute terms and as a share of their national debt.
 Canada has about $5.8 billion ($4.4 U.S.) of index linked debt,
Australia has about $6 billion ($4.8 U.S.) and New Zealand has
only about $200 million ($130 U.S.).  New Zealand has recently
increased its use of index linked debt and investor interest has
been strong because of the high yields (5.8%) and the fact that
New Zealand will soon have an election under a new system of proportional
representation which could weaken political support for non-inflationary
economic policies.  Canada issued its first index linked bonds
during 1991 when real interest rates on conventional bonds were
at high levels and then reduced the supply as interest rates fell.
 But the Canadian govenment recently began issuing new index linked
bonds and plans to have quarterly auctions at a rate of $300-500
million.  Sweden introduced index linked bonds only last year
but it is promoting them so aggressively that they could be worth
about 10% of Sweden's $100 billion of public debt by early 1997.
 The bonds have so far suffered from illiquidity because pension
funds have been hoarding them, but the coming expansion of supply
should enhance trading.  They offer a real yield of over 5.5%
as well as an inflation adjustment but, in contrast to Britain
and Australia, there is no tax exemption for the inflation indexation
component of the return.
<P>
The U.S. Treasury plans to offer a ten year bond in denominations
as small as $1,000 in 1997 and $50 in 1998. The new bond will
be indexed by the general CPI urban inflation rate.  The Treasury
designed the bonds after holding hearings around the country about
issues such as the appropriate indexation formula and maturity
of the bonds.  It says that the model for its new security will
be the Canadian Real Return bonds.  As with Canada, the value
of the principal will be adjusted for inflation and every six
months the security will pay interest, which will be an amount
equal to a fixed percentage of the inflation adjusted value of
the principal.  The Treasury also guarantees the final payment
of principal of the security will not be less than the original
par value of the security at issuance, so deflation would not
produce a decline in the value of the bond.
<P>
The one issue which the Treasury did not propose for debate was
the tax treatment of the bonds.   It intends to tax both the real
return and the inflation adjustment component of the new instruments
despite the fact that Britain and Australia have exempted the
inflation adjustment from taxation.  Senior officials in the Clinton
administration are aware of the tax differential with the other
countries but they cannot introduce a tax allowance for the inflation
component of the bond return without obtaining Congressional permission.
 As a result of the intense partisan environment in Washington
following the early 1996 acrimony over fiscal policy, the Treasury
is reluctant to seek congressional cooperation in adding a tax
allowance.   The decision to tax the inflation component of the
return will greatly reduce the appeal of the index linked securities
for taxable investors, such as high income individuals, but it
will not discourage demand from pension funds and other tax exempt
retirement savings programs.
<P>
The Treasury has not yet volunteered an opinion on the yield which
the new index linked bonds will have to offer because it will
obviously depend upon market conditions at the time of issue.
 At present, the UK  government's index linked bond is offering
a real yield of 3.9%, the Australian and Canadian index linked
bonds offer real yields of 4.5-5.0% and New Zealand index linked
debt offers a real yield of 5.9%.  The government of the United
States should be able to sell securities at a lower yield than
her Majesty's governments in London, Ottawa, Canberra and Wellington,
but it is doubtful that the yield will be much below the yield
available on the UK securities for two reasons.  First, the U.S.
government wants to tax the security's inflation adjustment whereas
Britain and Australia do not impose any tax.  Secondly, American
investors have enjoyed such high returns on conventional financial
assets during recent years that they will probably not be attracted
to a low yield inflation adjusted security until there is more
widespread pessimism about the outlook for inflation itself. 
The real yield on U.S. equities during the 20th century has averaged
about 6.8% while the real yield during the past decade has been
close to 10.2%.  The real yield on U.S. bonds during the past
century has averaged close to 3.0% but real interest rates were
so high during the 1980's that many investors now believe they
should earn a real yield on bonds of at least 4.0-6.0% excluding
capital gains.  Since 1992, the yields on long-term Treasury securities
have fluctuated between 5.5% and 8.25% while the annual CPI inflation
rate has averaged 3.0%, 2.8% and 2.6%.  The real total return
on U.S. government bonds since 1986 has also been 5.14%.  The
major advantage of the new index linked security is that interest
payments will expand in line with the bank's inflation adjusted
principal.  Neither the coupon nor the value of the principal
will be fixed.
<P>
In its early stages, the new index linked security will probably
appeal to four categories of investors.  First, it will be of
interest to pension funds which want to obtain an inflation-adjusted
asset which they can use for matching with long-term liabilities.
 Secondly, the instrument will appeal to investment contrarians
whom believe that Wall Street has become overly optimistic about
inflation and that the move towards expansionary monetary policy
now underway in most G-7 countries will produce a burst of higher
commodity prices next year.   Since the U.S. Treasury's index
linked bond has the potential to be more liquid and tradable than
the index linked bonds of other countries, it could also help
to attract capital from inflation wary investors all over the
world.  Thirdly, many Wall Street firms will probably use the
index-linked bonds to create new hybrid securities offering arbitrage
against other potential inflation hedges, such as gold, commodities,
and real estate.  The Treasury may also produce an instrument
with strip features which could emerge as a popular way for traders
to play on the market's changing perceptions of inflation.  Wall
Street has not yet developed a nickname for the index linked bonds,
but it is not difficult to imagine labels such as the &quot;Clinton
strips&quot; or &quot;Rubin Zeros&quot; becoming popular in the
financial media.  Finally, retail investment service organizations
will probalby use the index linked bonds to develop inflation
adjusted annuities and other retirement oriented products.
<P>
When the UK government introduced index linked bonds, it was perceived
that the major loser in institutional asset allocation models
would be real estate.  As a result of Britain's high inflation
rate after 1950, property had come to play an increasingly important
role in the portfolio of many British pension funds and insurance
companies.  Because of the long upturn in the UK economy after
1982, the index linked bonds did not prevent a significant boom
in British commercial and residential real estate during the mid
and late 1980's.  But as a result of the poor performance of British
property since 1989, the odds are high that many institutions
will increase the weighting of index linked bonds at the expense
of property  and other traditional inflation hedge assets in the
future.  A similar trend could occur in the U.S. once institutions
became more comfortable with index-linked securities.
<P>
The U.S. Treasury has been debating the introduction of index
linked bonds for many years.  After the Thatcher government introduced
them in 1981, many American economists suggested that they would
be a useful innovation in government finance for the U.S. Treasury
as well.  In the early 1980's, the interaction of large budget
deficits, restrictive monetary policy, and financial deregulation
produced real yields on U.S. government bonds as high as 8-9%,
so it was widely perceived that the Treasury would be able to
save money by introducing index linked bonds.  Many economic commentators
also stressed that the introduction of index linked bonds would
deny government the benefits of future inflation in reducing its
debt servicing costs and thus remove one of the great moral hazard
risks in economic policy.  But Wall Street was opposed to the
introduction of index linked bonds and Donald Regan did not want
to challenge the dealer community.  He might also have been uncomfortable
about possible comparisons with the D-mark denominated securities
which the Treasury had briefly introduced during the Carter administration
in order to bolster investor confidence in the dollar.
<P>
The Treasury probably has several motives for introducing index
linked bonds today.
<P>
First, bond yields have recently increased by almost 100 basis
points because of investor anxiety about a revival of the economy
and the failure of congressional efforts to reduce the federal
deficit.  The Treasury hopes that it will be able to reduce its
funding costs by offering a security which is indexed for inflation.
<P>
Secondly, the index linked bonds will provide a new yardstick
for measuring inflation expectations in the financial markets.
 At present, policy makers attempt to gauge inflationary psychology
by focusing on variables such as commodity prices, gold, the Australian
dollar, and the slope of the yield curve but none of these indicators
is as pure a proxy for inflation expectations as an instrument
which will be directly linked to the CPI, the GDP deflator, or
some comparable inflation index.
<P>
Thirdly, the Treasury views the index linked bond as an instrument
which could be attractive to the baby boomers now accumulating
savings for retirement through defined contribution pension funds,
401-K plans, Individual Retirement Accounts, and so on.  The U.S.
mutual fund industry now has over $3.1 trillion of assets compared
to $4.5 trillion of assets in the banking system and nearly one
third of the mutual fund industry's assets are in long-term retirement
savings programs.  As the baby boom generation moves into its
late 40's and 50's, it will be increasing its allocation of capital
to long-term retirement savings programs which would be a natural
market for an inflation indexed security.  If the federal government
ever decides to privatize the social security system through the
creation of  Chilean style household retirement accounts, such
savings programs also would be a potentially important market
for index linked bonds.  At present, social security assets are
invested in short maturity government instruments with yields
which correlate with those in the marketplace.  They provide no
explicit guarantees against inflation despite the fact that social
security payments are indexed for inflation.
<P>
As a result of the good performance of inflation in the U.S. economy
during recent years, the introduction of U.S. Treasury index linked
debt will have a less dramatic impact on the investment community
than would have been the case during the 1970's or 1980's.  But
the yield which emerges on the index linked bonds will gradually
become an important benchmark for evaluating the portfolio returns
on both traditional investment products as well as those focused
specifically on beating inflation.
<P>
What remains to be seen is whether the U.S. Treasury will actually
be able to reduce its funding costs by introducing index linked
bonds.  Cynics have already argued that the decision to offer
index linked debts is a confirmation that inflation has bottomed
and that the government is accepting a liability which will prove
to be quite expensive in future years.  But cynicism aside, the
real problem facing the Treasury is that investors have earned
such high returns form both equities and conventional debt securities
during recent years that they may not be prepared to accept a
low real yield on a taxable index linked bond until they see clear
evidence of accelerating inflation and a correction in other financial
asset markets.  At present, there is little sign of such a sentiment
shift occurring.  Despite the recent uptick in oil and food prices,
investors have remained remarkably complacent about the risk of
higher inflation.  As a result, the Treasury should consider hedging
its new funding strategy with other financial alternatives.  Instead
of offering the public only a security indexed to the inflation
rate, it should introduce new instruments indexed to both the
inflation rate and the S&amp;P 500.  Once it has established a
market for both securities, the Treasury could then fine tune
the issuance of new supply to reflect changing investor perceptions
of the economic outlook.  On the basis of current investor attitude,
it is doubtful that the Treasury will be able to achieve significant
savings by offering instruments indexed only to the CPI.  But
by offering instruments for hedging against both inflation and
stock market risk, it should be able to both reduce government
borrowing costs and create useful instruments for helping the
baby boom generation cope with the coming transition to a privatized
social security system.
