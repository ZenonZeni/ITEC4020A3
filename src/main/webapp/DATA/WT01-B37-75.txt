<hr size="5">

<p>In 1907, when Georgia and Oklahoma made the manufacture, sale,
or transportation of intoxicating liquors illegal state wide, the
homicide rate in the United States was 1 person per 100,000 per
year.<i>[2]</i> Before the end of the decade, 13 states plus
Alaska, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia had gone dry.<i>[6]</i>
By 1919--when the 18th amendment was passed, making alcohol use
illegal nationwide--the homicide rate had grown to 8 per 100,000.
The murder rate climbed steadily until it peaked at 10 per
100,000 around 1933, when our nation admitted its mistake, and
repealed the 18th amendment. By 1943 the homicide rate had
drastically shrunk to 5 per 100,000 and stayed near that level
until 1964 when the United States made the same mistake all over
again (<a href="http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~cundiff/homic.gif">
see graphic</a>).<i>[2]</i></p>

<p>In December of 1964, having been ratified by 40 countries, the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 went into effect
restricting narcotic drug use to medical and scientific purposes.
It also internationally banned narcotic drug trade outside of
government monopolies.<i>[8]</i> History was about to repeat
itself. From 1964 to 1970 in the United States, the number of
state prisoners incarcerated for drug offenses more than doubled
from 3,079 to 6,596 (it was 90,000 in 1989)<i>[9]</i>, and the
new concentration on enforcing victimless crimes caused the
homicide rate to skyrocket. Between 1964 and 1970 the homicide
rate doubled from 5 per 100,000 to 10 per 100,000, where it has
remained, with minor fluctuations, until today.<i>[2]</i> Lyndon
Johnson had declared war on drugs, to be followed by Richard
Nixon declaring War on Drugs in 1969, Ronald Reagan declaring War
on Drugs in 1982, and George Bush declaring War on Drugs in 1989.<i>[4]</i></p>

<p>At the turn of the century, both heroin and aspirin were
legally available and sold for approximately the same amount.
Today aspirin can be purchased at the corner drug store for 20
cents per gram; heroin costs $50 per gram. <i>[p. 33, 3]</i> The
price of heroin rose drastically after it was made illegal due to
the dangers involved in its sale. Dealers are willing to kill
each other for profits obtained from such a lucrative market;
junkies are willing to rob and kill for money to support their
habit--money, if drugs were legal and cheap, that they could
easily obtain by working at McDonald's. You and I, through high
crime rates caused by the War on Drugs and high tax rates used to
support the War on Drugs, pay the price. During prohibition
&quot;liquor store&quot; owners murdered each other to protect
their turf just as drug dealers do today. Today, liquor store
owners are generally peaceful. Eliminating the enormous profits
involved in black-market businesses eliminates the motive for
violent crime, and therefore the violent crime.</p>

<p>More law enforcement is commonly touted as the answer to
America's violent crime problem. Since 1970 the percentage of the
American population in prison has tripled with no noticeable
effect on the homicide rate.<i>[2]</i> More than 1.3 million
citizens are now in jail.<i>[p. 24, 3]</i> The United States has
a larger percentage of its population in prison than any other
nation<i>[2]</i>, and still maintains the highest homicide rate
in the industralized world. [1] We have even thrown away parts of
our constitution in the name of fighting crime. Asset forfeiture
laws allow law enforcement officers to seize the property of
American citizens without even charging them with a crime, even
though the 5th amendment to the constitution clearly states
&quot;No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or
property, without due process of law...&quot; Of course if you
want your property back you do have the right to post a bond and
try to prove yourself innocent, of a crime you have not even been
charged with, in a court of law. No attorney will be provided for
you if you cannot afford one. Over $2.4 billion worth of assets
have been seized since 1985, $664 million in 1991 alone--and in
80% of the cases no charges were ever filed.<i>[7]</i></p>

<p>Disparities between the poor and the rich are often considered
causes of our high crime rate, but the United States has not only
one of the world's highest crime rates, but also one of the
world's largest middle classes. The religious right claims
America's huge crime rate is caused by a break-down of family
values. This would require family values breaking down suddenly
in 1907, returning in 1933, and suddenly breaking down again in
1964. Many liberals believe that America's large crime rate is
due to our lack of gun-control laws, but America's gun-control
policy has changed little throughout this century. There is no
way gun control can explain the enormous fluctuations in
America's homicide rate. The United States government's substance
control policies are the only answer. The only way to lower
America's violent crime rate, short of turning the United States
into a totalitarian state, is through ending the War on Drugs.</p>

<p>The growing list of people who support decriminalization of
drugs in America include: <a
href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/buckley/buck013096.html">William
F. Buckley</a>, George Carlin, George Crockett, Alan Dershowitz,
Phil Donahue, Hugh Downs, <a href="../Misc/friedm1.htm">Milton
Friedman</a>, Ira Glasser, Michael Kinsley, David Letterman, John
McLaughlin, Andy Rooney, Carl Sagan, Kurt Schmoke, Tom Selleck,
George Shultz, George Silver, Tom Snyder, Robert Sweet, Thomas
Szasz, Garry Trudeau, and Donald Trump.<i>[5]</i></p>

<p>Organizations opposed to the War on Drugs include the <a
