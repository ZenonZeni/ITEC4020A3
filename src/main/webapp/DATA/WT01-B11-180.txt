<B>Province Adopts Strategy to Enhance<BR>
Environmental Protection in Temagami

</B>

</CENTER><P>
The province today announced a comprehensive land-use strategy for the Temagami area that will increase environmental protection, protect more old growth sites and resolve long-standing land-use issues.<P>

"Our government has promised fair and common-sense principles for meeting the objectives of environmental protection in Temagami," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "This 
land-use strategy sets up a framework that will protect the environment, improve community stability and, after years of uncertainty, get on with the job of enhancing the quality of life in the Temagami area."<P>

Through the land-use strategy, MNR will create Protected Areas that prohibit resource extraction and Special Management Areas that require careful management of resource extraction.  In both areas MNR will allow and encourage recreation and tourism.  These areas will provide additional protection around Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.  Together these areas total 300,000 hectares, an area about three times the size of the 100,000 hectares of forests and waters protected in seven provincial parks in the Temagami area.<P>

The province developed its comprehensive strategy from the 39 recommendations the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC) presented to the government in April.<P>

"The CPC and predecessors spent nearly a decade undertaking extensive consultation with the public and studying land-use issues before recommending locally developed solutions," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The province's strategy adopts 22 of the CPC recommendations without change and adopts the other 17 recommendations with minor changes.<P>

As part of the strategy, the province will protect an additional 2,628 hectares of old growth red and white pine and will also protect the 3,520 hectare North Obabika site, which includes 939 hectares of old growth red and white pine.  Protected old growth red and white pine sites will cover 10,800 hectares in provincial parks, the Lake Temagami skyline reserve and a new protection zone.<P>

"This government recognizes the importance of old growth forests.  That's why we've increased the area of protected old growth red and white pine," Mr. Hodgson said.  "We also recognize the importance of protecting headwaters in the Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater park area and through the strategy we have added the necessary safeguards."<P>

The province has also acknowledged the need to resolve outstanding issues with local aboriginal communities.  To provide the opportunity for resolution, the province has set aside lands that could form part of a land claim settlement.  The Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat will pursue a resolution over the next two years.<P>

"We want to improve the quality of life for all communities in the Temagami area and that is why we have included in this strategy significant measures that allow us to work out agreements with local aboriginal communities," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Through the new strategy, MNR will establish four new land use zones in the Temagami area.  These zones were recommended by the CPC.  They are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Protected Areas where logging, mineral and aggregate extraction are not permitted
<LI>Special Management Areas where resource extraction will be allowed under special prescriptions to ensure protection of significant resource values
<LI>Integrated Management Areas where resource extraction and development will be carefully managed and public access will be less restricted than in the Protected and Special Management areas
<LI>Developed Areas where resource management will be permitted and controlled to ensure it is compatible with other uses.
</UL>
MNR will also spend until September 30 working with local interests to examine a new governance structure for Temagami as part of the ministry's acceptance of the CPC recommendation on this issue.<P>

As a result of the implementation of the new comprehensive strategy, staking of new mining claims will be allowed to resume in areas identified for resource development.  Following a notice period, staking will begin September 17.  The notice period will be longer than the usual 60-day period to notify claim holders of the re-opening and to produce new, up-to-date maps for use by claim seekers.<P>
