<p>The production of cannabinoids and their associated terpenes
in <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to environmental influences as
well as hereditary determinants. Their biosynthesis occurs in
specialized glands populating the surface of all aerial
structures of the plant. These compounds apparently serve as
defensive agents in a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial,
antifeedant and UV-B pigmentation roles. In addition, the more
intense ambient UV-B of the tropics, in combination with the UV-B
lability of cannabidiol, may have influenced the evolution of an
alternative biogenetic route from cannabigerol to
tetrahydrocannabinol in some varieties. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<em>

<p>Cannabis</em> may have been the first cultivated plant.
Records indicate use of this crop for paper, textiles, food and
medicine throughout human history (Abel 1980). It is a dioecious
annual with rather distinctive palmate leaves, usually composed
of an odd number of leaflets. Best growth occurs on recently
disturbed sites of high soil nitrogen content, so it is commonly
found as a persistent weed at the edge of cultivated fields.
Mature height ranges from 1 to 5 meters, according to
environmental and hereditary dictates. Typically, the male plant
is somewhat taller and more obviously flowered. These flowers
have five yellowish tepals, and five anthers that hang
pendulously at maturity, dispersing their pollen to the wind. The
female plant exhibits a more robust appearance due to its shorter
branches and dense growth of leaves and flower-associated bracts.
Its double-styled flower possesses only a thin, closely adherent
perianth, but is further protected by enclosure in a cuplike
bracteole (i.e., perigonal bract), subtended by a usually
monophyllous leaflet. A single achene is produced per flower and
shed or dispersed as a result of bird predation. The life cycle
of the male is completed soon after anthesis, but the female
survives until full seed ripeness. </p>

<p><em>Cannabis</em> seems a virtual factory for the production
of secondary metabolic compounds. A variety of alkanes have been
identified (Adams, Jr. and Jones 1973, De Zeeuw <em>et al.</em>
1973b, Mobarak <em>et al.</em> 1974a &amp; 1974b), as well as
nitrogenous compounds (ElSohly and Turner 1976, Hanus 1975b),
flavonoids (Gellert <em>et al.</em> 1974, Paris <em>et al.</em>
1975b, Paris and Paris 1973) and other miscellaneous compounds
(Hanus 1976a &amp; 1976b). Terpenes appear in abundance (Hanus
1975a, Hendricks <em>et al.</em> 1975) and contribute to the
characteristic odor of the plant (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973) and
some of its crude preparations, such as hashish. The compounds
which comprise the active drug ingredients are apparently unique
to this genus and are termed cannabinoids. Cannabinoids were
originally thought to exist as the phenolic compounds, but later
research (Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971a, Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Small and Beckstead 1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b) has
indicated their existence predominantly in the form of carboxylic
acids which decarboxylate readily with time (Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b), upon heating (De Zeeuw <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Kimura and Okamoto 1970) or in alkaline
conditions (Grlic and Andrec 1961, Masoud and Doorenboos 1973).
There are over 60 of these type compounds present in the plant
(Turner <em>et al.</em> 1980). </p>

<p>Much has been published concerning the influence of heredity
on cannabinoid production (e.g., Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971b,
Small and Beckstead 1973), but ecological factors have long been
thought to have an important influence by stressing the <em>Cannabis</em>
plant (Bouquet 1950). The resultant increased biosynthesis of the
cannabinoid and terpene containing resin, in most cases, seems
likely of advantage to the organism in adapting it to a variety
of survival-threatening situations. This work reviews these
biotic and abiotic challenges and speculates on the utility of <em>Cannabis</em>
resin to the plant. </p>

<h3>Anatomical distribution and biogenesis of the cannabinoids</h3>

<p>The major sites of cannabinoid production appear to be
epidermal glands (Fairbairn 1972, Hammond and Mahlberg 1973,
Lanyon <em>et al.</em> 1981, Malingre <em>et al.</em> 1975) which
exhibit a marked variation in size, shape and population density,
depending on the anatomical locale examined. While there are no
published reports of glands present on root surfaces, most of the
aerial parts possess them, along with non-glandular trichomes (De
Pasquale <em>et al.</em> 1974). These epidermal glands seem to
fall into two broad categories: stalked and sessile. The stalked
gland (Fig. 1, front page) can consist of a single cell or small
group of cells arranged in a rosette on a single or multicellular
pedestal. Lack of thorough ontogenetic study has led to the
speculation that some of this variation may be attributable to
observation of various developmental stages (Ledbetter and
Krikorian 1975). The sessile gland possesses no stalk and has
secretory cells located at or below the epidermal surface
(Fairbairn 1972). In either case, the glandular cells are covered
with a &quot;sheath&quot; under which the resins are secreted via
vesicles (Mahlberg and Kim 1992). This sheath consists of a
cuticle that coats a polysaccharide layer (presumed cellulose)
originating from the primary cell wall (Hammond and Mahlberg
1978). The resins accumulate until the sheath bulges away from
the secretory cells, forming a spheroid structure. The resin is
then released by rupture of the membrane or through pores in its
surface (De Pasquale 1974). The cannabinoid content of each plant
part varies, paralleling observable gland distribution (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp; 1971b, Kimura
and Okamoto 1970, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971, Ono <em>et al.</em>
1972), although Turner <em>et al.</em> (1978) have disagreed.
Roots contain only trace amounts. Stalks, branches and twigs have
greater quantities, although not as much as leaf material.
Vegetative leaf contains varying quantities depending on its
position on the plant: lower leaves possessing less and upper
ones more. Leaf glands are most dense on the abaxial (underside)
surface. The greatest amount of cannabinoids is found in the new
growth near each apical tip (Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Steinberg <em>et
al.</em> 1975), although Ono <em>et al.</em> (1972) seem to
differ on this point. This variation in leaf gland placement may
be due to either loss of glands as the leaf matures or a greater
the endowment of glands on leaves successively produced as the
plant matures. Additional study on this point is required. </p>

<p>Once sexual differentiation has occurred, the generation of
female reproductive organs and their associated bracts increases
total plant cannabinoid content. Bracts subtending the female
flowers contain a greater density of glands than the leaves. The
small cuplike bracteole (perigonal bract) enclosing the pistil
has the highest cannabinoid content of any single plant part
(Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp;
1971b). Second only to this is the flower itself (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b). Since it has no reported epidermal gland
structures, the cannabinoids present must be due to either
undiscovered production sites or simple adherence of resin from
the inner surface of its intimately associated bracteole. This
conjecture is supported by the finding that the achenes do not
contain substantial amounts of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b, Ono <em>et al.</em> 1972). Reproductive
structures of the male plant are also provided with greater
concentrations of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et al.</em>
1971b, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971). Stalked glands have been
observed covering the tepal, with massively stalked glands
occurring on the stamen filament (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976). In
addition, rows of very large sessile glands are found situated in
grooves on the anther itself (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976,
Fairbairn 1972) and apparently provide the pollen with a
considerable cannabinoid content (Paris <em>et al.</em> 1975a). </p>

<p><em>Delta</em>-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the cannabinoid
responsible for the main psychoactive effects of most <em>Cannabis</em>
drug preparations (Mechoulam 1970). In some varieties of <em>Cannabis</em>,
additional cannabinoid homologs appear that have the usual pentyl
group attached to the aromatic ring, replaced by a propyl (De
Zeeuw <em>et al.</em> 1972b &amp; 1973a, Fetterman and Turner
1972, Gill 1971, Gill <em>et al.</em> 1970, Merkus 1971, Vree <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973a) or occasionally a
methyl group (Vree <em>et al.</em> 1971 &amp; 1972b). Other
claims have been made for butyl (Harvey 1976) or heptyl (Isbell
1973) substitutions, but the latter announcement seems
particularly tenuous. THC is thought to be produced by the plant
(Fig. 2, next page) from cannabidiol (CBD) which, in turn, is
derived from cannabigerol (CBG) generated from non-cannabinoid
precursors (Hammond and Mahlberg 1994, Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1984, Turner and Mahlberg 1988). CBG is also the biogenetic
precursor of cannabichromene (CBC). Some of the cannabinoids
(e.g., cannabielsoin, cannabinol, and cannabicyclol) are probably
degradation products of the enzymatically produced cannabinoids
(e.g., CBD, THC and CBC, respectively). </p>

(THC). </p>

<h2>Cannabinoids and environmental stress</h2>

<h3>Desiccation</h3>

<p>THC is a viscous hydrophobic oil (Garrett and Hunt 1974) that
resists crystallization (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1971) and is of low
volatility (Adams <em>et al.</em> 1941). Since the sticky resins
produced and exuded on the surface of the plant are varying
combinations of THC, other cannabinoids and a variety of
terpenes, they can be seen as analogous to the waxy coatings of
the cacti and other succulents that serve as a barrier to water
loss in dry environments. </p>

<p>Bouquet (1950) has mentioned that the western side of
Lebanon's mountainous <em>Cannabis</em> growing areas is less
favorable for resin production because of humid sea winds. De
Faubert Maunder (1976) also observed that the copious separable
resin needed for hashish production occurs only &quot;in a belt
passing from Morocco eastwards, taking in the Mediterranean area,
Arabia, the Indian sub-continent and ending in Indo-China.&quot;
These are mostly areas notable for their sparse rainfall, low
humidity and sunny climate. Is it merely coincidence that resin
is produced according to this pattern, as well? </p>

<p>Experimental evidence is accumulating that reinforces these
notions. Sharma (1975) reported a greater glandular trichome
density on leaves of <em>Cannabis</em> growing in xeric
circumstances. Paris <em>et al.</em> (1975a) have demonstrated a
marked increase in the cannabinoid content of <em>Cannabis</em>
pollen with decreased humidity. Murari <em>et al.</em> (1983)
grew a range of <em>Cannabis</em> fiber cultivars in three
climatic zones of Italy and found higher THC levels in those
plants grown in the drier &quot;continental&quot; (<em>versus</em>
&quot;maritime&quot;) climate. Hakim <em>et al.</em> (1986)
report that CBD-rich English <em>Cannabis</em> devoid of THC
produced significant amounts of THC and less CBD, when grown in
the Sudan. This trend was accentuated in their next generation of
plants. </p>

<p>Haney and Kutscheid (1973) have shown significant correlations
of plant cannabinoid content with factors affecting soil moisture
availability: content of clay or sand, percent slope of plot, and
competition from surrounding vegetation. In some cases, this last
factor was noted to have induced a stunted plant with
&quot;disproportionally smaller roots&quot;, which would tend to
increase both the frequency and severity of desiccation stress. </p>

<p>In a study of 10 Kansas locations, Latta and Eaton (1975)
found wide differences in plant cannabinoid content, observing
that &quot;<em>delta</em>-9-THC ranged from 0.012 to 0.49% and
generally increased as locations became less favorable for plant
growth, suggesting increased plant stress enhanced <em>delta</em>-9-THC
production.&quot; Mention was also made of a positive correlation
between competing vegetation and THC content. Although the
sampling area was not considered very moisture deficient, they
speculated that &quot;Greater difference among locations might
have been observed under drought conditions.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature </h3>

<p>Temperature may play a role in determining cannabinoid
content, but perhaps only through its association with moisture
availability. Boucher <em>et al.</em> (1974) reported an increase
in cannabinoid content with temperature (32o C. <em>vs.</em> 22o
C.), however, some variables such as increased water loss due to
accelerated evaporation and plant transpiration at high
temperatures were left unaccounted. In contrast, Bazzaz <em>et
al.</em> (1975), using 4 <em>Cannabis</em> ecotypes of both
tropical and temperate character, demonstrated a definite
decrease in cannabinoid production with increased temperature
(32o C. <em>vs.</em> 23o C.). Later studies by Braut-Boucher
(1980) on clones of 2 strains from South Africa revealed a more
complex pattern of biosynthesis according to strain, gender and
chemical homologue produced. Clearly, further study of this
parameter is needed. </p>

<h3>Soil Nutrients</h3>

<p>Mineral balance seems to influence cannabinoid production.
Krejci (1970) found increases related to unspecified &quot;poor
soil conditions&quot;. Haney and Kutcheid (1973) have shown the
influence of soil K, P, Ca and N concentrations on Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>.
They report a distinctly negative correlation between soil K and
plant <em>delta</em>-9-THC content, although K-P interaction, N
and Ca were positively correlated with it. These minerals were
also shown to affect the production of CBD, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and cannabinol (CBN), although the latter two compounds are now
thought to be spontaneous degradation products of <em>delta</em>-9-THC.
Kaneshima <em>et al.</em> (1973) have demonstrated the importance
of optimal Fe levels for plant synthesis of THC. Latta and Eaton
(1975) reported Mg and Fe to be important for THC production,
suggesting that these minerals may serve as enzyme co-factors.
Coffman and Gentner (1975) also corroborated the importance of
soil type and mineral content, and observed a significant
negative correlation between plant height at harvest and THC
levels. Interestingly, Marshman <em>et al.</em> (1976) report
greater amounts of THC in Jamaican plants growing in
&quot;organically&quot; enriched (<em>vs.</em> artificially
fertilized) soils. </p>

<h3>Insect predation</h3>

<p>Wounding of the plant has been employed as a method to
increase resin production (Emboden 1972). This increase may be a
response to desiccation above the point of vascular disruption.
Under natural circumstances, wounding most often occurs as a
result of insect attack. This is a source of environmental stress
which the production of terpenes and cannabinoids may be able to
minimize. <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to few predators (Smith
and Haney 1973, Stannard <em>et al.</em> 1970) and has even been
utilized in powdered or extract form as an insecticide (Bouquet
1950) or repellent (Khare <em>et al.</em> 1974). Its apparent
defensive mechanisms include a generous covering of non-glandular
trichomes, emission of volatile terpenoid substances, and
exudation of the sticky cannabinoids. <em>Cannabis</em> is often
noted for its aromatic quality and many of the terpenes produced
are known to possess insect-repellent properties. Among these are
alpha and beta pinene, limonene, terpineol and borneol. Pinenes
and limonene comprise over 75% of the volatiles detected in the
surrounding atmosphere, but account for only 7% of the essential
oil (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973). Consistent with glandular
trichome density and cannabinoid content, more of these terpenes
are produced by the inflorescences than the leaves, and their
occurrence is also greater in the female plant (Martin <em>et al.</em>
1961). </p>

<p>No insect toxicity studies using isolated cannabinoids have
been published to date. Rothschild <em>et al.</em> (1977) found
THC-rich Mexican (<em>vs.</em> CBD-rich Turkish) <em>Cannabis</em>
fatal to tiger moth (<em>Arctia caja</em>) larvae, but not
Nigerian grasshopper (<em>Zonocerus elegans</em>) nymphs.
Rothschild and Fairbairn (1980) later found that pure THC (<em>vs.</em>
CBD) sprayed on cabbage leaves, does repel the large white
cabbage butterfly (<em>Pieris brassicae</em>). </p>

<p>The cannabinoids may also serve as a purely mechanical
defense. A tiny creature crossing the leaf surface could rupture
the tenuously attached globular resin reservoirs of the glandular
trichomes (Ledbetter and Krikorian 1975) and become ensnared in
resin. A sizable chewing insect, if able to overcome these
defenses, would still have difficulty chewing the gummy resin,
along with the cystolithic trichomes and silicified covering
trichomes also present on the leaf. The utility of these
epidermal features as insect antifeedants is also inferable from
their predominant occurrence on the insect-favored abaxial leaf
surface. Although the above strategies represent a seemingly
sophisticated system, many other plants (Levin 1973) and even
arthropods (Eisner 1970) utilize similar defense mechanisms,
often employing identical terpenes! </p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>Terpenes may also help to suppress the growth of surrounding
vegetation (Muller and Hauge 1967, Muller <em>et al.</em> 1964).
Haney and Bazzaz (1970) speculated that such a mechanism may be
operative in <em>Cannabis</em>. They further ventured that since
the production of terpenes is not fully developed in very young
plants, this may explain their inability to compete successfully
with other vegetation until more mature. The observation (Latta
and Eaton 1975) of increased THC production by plants in
competition with surrounding vegetation &quot;at a time in the
growing season when moisture was not limiting&quot;, may indicate
a stimulus for cannabinoid production beyond that of simple water
stress. </p>

<h3>Bacteria and fungi</h3>

<p>The cannabinoids may serve as a protectant against
microorganisms. <em>Cannabis</em> preparations have long served
as medicines (apart from their psychoactive properties) and are
effective against a wide variety of infectious diseases (Kabelic <em>et
al.</em> 1960, Mikuriya 1969). These antibiotic properties have
been demonstrated with both <em>Cannabis</em> extracts (Ferenczy <em>et
al.</em> 1958, Kabelic <em>et al.</em> 1960, Radosevic <em>et al.</em>
1962) and a variety of isolated cannabinoids (ElSohly <em>et al.</em>
1982, Farkas and Andrassy 1976, Gal and Vajda 1970, Van Klingeren
and Ten Ham 1976). CBG has been compared (Mechoulam and Gaoni
1965) in both &quot;structure and antibacterial properties to
grifolin, an antibiotic from the basidiomycete <em>Grifolia
conflens</em>.&quot; Ferency (1956) has demonstrated the
antibiotic properties of <em>Cannabis</em> seed, a factor that
may aid its survival when overwintering. Adherent resin on the
seed surface, as well as a surrounding mulch of spent <em>Cannabis</em>
leaves, may serve in this regard. </p>

<p>Some of the many fungal pathogens that affect <em>Cannabis</em>
include <em>Alternaria alterata</em> (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), <em>Ascochyta
prasadii</em> (Shukla and Pathak 1967), <em>Botryosphaeria
marconii</em> (Charles and Jenkins 1914), <em>Cercospora
cannabina</em> and <em>C. cannabis</em> (Lentz <em>et al.</em>
1974), <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> (McCain and Noviello 1985), <em>Phoma</em>
sp. (Srivastava and Naithani 1979) and <em>Phomopsis ganjae</em>
(McPartland 1984). </p>

<p>While <em>A. alterata</em> attacks Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>
and destroys 2.8-45.5% of the seed (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), the
balance of these species are leaf spot diseases. McPartland
(1984) has demonstrated the inhibitory effects of THC and CBD on <em>Phomopsis
ganjae</em>. However, De Meijer <em>et al.</em> (1992), in
evaluating a large collection of <em>Cannabis</em> genotypes, did
not find a correlation between cannabinoid content and the
occurence of <em>Botrytis</em>. Fungal evolution of a mechanism
for overcoming the plant's cannabinoid defenses may be
responsible for their success as pathogens. Indeed, some have
been demonstrated to metabolize THC and other cannabinoids
(Binder 1976, Binder and Popp 1980, Robertson <em>et al.</em>
1975). </p>

<h3>Ultraviolet radiation</h3>

<p>Another stress to which plants are subject results from their
daily exposure to sunlight. While necessary to sustain
photosynthesis, natural light contains biologically destructive
ultraviolet radiation. This selective pressure has apparently
affected the evolution of certain defenses, among them, a
chemical screening functionally analogous to the pigmentation of
human skin. A preliminary investigation (Pate 1983) indicated
that, in areas of high ultraviolet radiation exposure, the UV-B
(280-315 nm) absorption properties of THC may have conferred an
evolutionary advantage to <em>Cannabis</em> capable of greater
production of this compound from biogenetic precursor CBD. The
extent to which this production is also influenced by
environmental UV-B induced stress has been experimentally
determined by Lydon <em>et al.</em> (1987). Their experiments
demonstrate that under conditions of high UV-B exposure,
drug-type <em>Cannabis</em> produces significantly greater
quantities of THC. They have also demonstrated the chemical
lability of CBD upon exposure to UV-B (Lydon and Teramura 1987),
in contrast to the stability of THC and CBC. However, studies by
Brenneisen (1984) have shown only a minor difference in UV-B
absorption between THC and CBD, and the absorptive properties of
CBC proved considerably greater than either. Perhaps the
relationship between the cannabinoids and UV-B is not so direct
as first supposed. Two other explanations must now be considered.
Even if CBD absorbs on par with THC, in areas of high ambient
UV-B, the former compound may be more rapidly degraded. This
could lower the availability of CBD present or render it the less
energetically efficient compound to produce by the plant.
Alternatively, the greater UV-B absorbency of CBC compared to THC
and the relative stability of CBC compared to CBD might nominate
this compound as the protective screening substance. The presence
of large amounts of THC would then have to be explained as merely
an accumulated storage compound at the end of the enzyme-mediated
cannabinoid pathway. However, further work is required to resolve
the fact that Lydon's (1985) experiments did not show a
commensurate increase in CBC production with increased UV-B
exposure. </p>

<p>This CBC pigmentation hypothesis would imply the development
of an alternative to the accepted biochemical pathway from CBG to
THC via CBD. Until 1973 (Turner and Hadley 1973), separation of
CBD and CBC by gas chromatography was difficult to accomplish, so
that many peaks identified as CBD in the preceding literature may
in fact have been CBC. Indeed, it has been noted (De Faubert
Maunder 1970) and corroborated by GC/MS (Turner and Hadley 1973)
that some tropical drug strains of <em>Cannabis</em> do not
contain any CBD at all, yet have an abundance of THC. This
phenomenon has not been observed for northern temperate varieties
of <em>Cannabis</em>. Absence of CBD has led some authors (De
Faubert Maunder 1970, Turner and Hadley 1973) to speculate that
another biogenetic route to THC is involved. Facts scattered
through the literature do indeed indicate a possible alternative.
Holley <em>et al.</em> (1975) have shown that Mississippi-grown
plants contain a considerable content of CBC, often in excess of
the CBD present. In some examples, either CBD or CBC was absent,
but in no case were plants devoid of both. Their analysis of
material grown in Mexico and Costa Rica served to accentuate this
trend. Only one example actually grown in their respective
countries revealed the presence of any CBD, although appreciable
quantities of CBC were found. The reverse seemed true as well.
Seed from Mexican material devoid of CBD was planted in
Mississippi and produced plants containing CBD. </p>

<p>Could CBC be involved in an alternate biogenetic route to THC?
Yagen and Mechoulam (1969) have synthesized THC (albeit in low
yield) directly from CBC. The method used was similar to the acid
catalyzed cyclization of CBD to THC (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1966).
Reaction by-products included cannabicyclol, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and <em>delta</em>-4,8-iso-THC, all products which have been
found in analyses of <em>Cannabis</em> (e.g., Novotny <em>et al.</em>
1976). Finally, radioisotope tracer studies (Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1975) have uncovered the intriguing fact that radiolabeled CBG
fed to a very low THC-producing strain of <em>Cannabis</em> is
found as CBD, but when fed to high THC-producing plants, appeared
only as CBC and THC. Labeled CBD fed to a Mexican example of
these latter plants likewise appeared as THC. Unfortunately,
radiolabeled CBC was not fed to their plants, apparently in the
belief that CBC branched off the biogenetic pathway at CBD and
dead ended. Their research indicated that incorporation of
labeled CBG into CBD or CBC was age dependent. Vogelman <em>et
al.</em> (1988) likewise report that the developmental stage of
seedlings, as well as their exposure to light, affects the
occurrence of CBG, CBC or THC in Mexican <em>Cannabis</em>. No
CBD was reported. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Although the chemistry of <em>Cannabis</em> has come under
extensive investigation, more work is needed to probe the
relationship of its resin to biotic and abiotic factors in the
environment. Glandular trichomes are production sites for the
bulk of secondary compounds present. It is probable that the
cannabinoids and associated terpenes serve as defensive agents in
a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial, antifeedant and UV-B
pigmentation roles. UV-B selection pressures seem responsible for
the distribution of THC-rich <em>Cannabis</em> varieties in areas
of high ambient radiation, and may have influenced the evolution
of an alternate biogenetic pathway from CBG to THC in some of
these strains. Though environmental stresses appear to be a
direct stimulus for enhanced chemical production by individual
plants, it must be cautioned that such stresses may also skew
data by hastening development of the highly glandular flowering
structures. Future studies will require careful and
representative sampling to assure meaningful results. </p>
