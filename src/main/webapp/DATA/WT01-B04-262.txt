<h3>Gov. Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. Leads NDSS Fund-Raising Campaign</h3>
The National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) is proud to announce that Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., former Connecticut governor and senator, will serve as Honorary Chairperson of <i>Thresholds - Opening Doors to Opportunity</i>, its new fund-raising campaign that has already raised $1.1 million toward its goal.
<p>
<i>Thresholds</i> is the Society’s five-year strategic plan to improve the lives of people with Down syndrome through projects and services in education, research and advocacy. Thresholds incorporates the most ambitious fund-raising project in NDSS’ 17-year-history, with a goal of raising $3.5 million in gifts and pledges from the private sector throughout the next year. The National Down Syndrome Society does not receive any government funding.
<p>
"We’re thrilled that Gov. Weicker has agreed to play an important role in this campaign. His long history as an advocate for the rights of the disabled makes him the natural choice for Honorary Chair," said Elizabeth Goodwin, NDSS Co-Founder and Board President.
<p>
Gov. Weicker is the author of many laws on behalf of people with disabilities, and is one of the principal authors of the Americans with Disabilities Act. He is currently Chairman of the firm Dresing, Lierman, Weicker of Bethesda, MD. 
<p>
The General Chairperson of <i>Thresholds</i> is longtime NDSS Board Member Thomas F. Robards. Mr. Robards is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Republic New York Corporation. "The <i>Thresholds</i> campaign will allow NDSS to aggressively take the lead in finding solutions to the diverse challenges related to Down syndrome," he said. "I am excited and encouraged by the enthusiastic support <i>Thresholds</i> has received so far."
<p>
<i>Thresholds</i> is an outgrowth of a comprehensive, nationwide assessment of the needs of people with Down syndrome, as well as an evaluation of the work of NDSS. The program includes the expansion and enhancement of current programs and initiation of a number of new projects in research, education and advocacy. 
<p>
These projects include the development of teaching tools to help educators encourage more inclusive and accepting behavior in the classroom, additional educational materials and seminars for new parents of children with Down syndrome, educational efforts aimed specifically at health care professionals who work with people who have Down syndrome, as well as programs to assist individuals with Down syndrome in mastering specific life skills.
<p>
Other <i>Thresholds</i> projects include the expansion of the Society’s current research efforts,  as well as additional grants to encourage applied research. Plans also incorporate the development of a pilot program to look at housing alternatives, advocacy training from the grassroots to the federal level, and a blue ribbon panel to address the many bio-ethical issues involved in treating people with Down syndrome.
