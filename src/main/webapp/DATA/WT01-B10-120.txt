Western (allopathic) medicine has been the mainstream form of health care in this country for over 100 years. The passage of time has diluted the history of its ascendancy to its position of social, political and economic power. It was not until a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, within the past 3 years, that people (and especially the medical establishment) realized that allopathic medicine does not have a mortgage on health care in this country.	
<BR><BR>This report stated that the American people are spending more money on so-called alternative medicines, mostly out of pocket, than they are on conventional medicines. Is it a wonder that the political/economic machine of the pharmaceutical/allopathic world has stepped into the Washington arena to stall health care reform?	
<BR><BR>Complementary health care (I use the term "health care" instead of medicine, because medicine has come to imply the giving, or intrusion of, another substance or act) is a very broad spectrum of interventions, aids, counselling and approaches. These are forms of assistance that truly "compliment" the skills, advantages and undeniable brilliance of the emergent, radical interventions of allopathic medicine. Nobody should give up the right to the amazing skills of the micro-surgeon, the emergency room physician or the unsurpassed ability of an MRI or Cat-scan to discover, for instance, the source of bleeding in the brain. However, allopathic medicine generally does a poor job of assisting people with the every day needs of managing their physical, emotional and spiritual expression.	
<BR><BR>Complementary health care providers tend to connect to their patient/clients on different levels. To be effective, they need to have an emotional and spiritual connection or understanding to truly comprehend the underlying needs of the person seeking assistance.

<BR><BR> Because complementary care providers often do not have the skills or knowledge to intervene in the emergency care of an individual, they tend to behave in a "preventative" way when dealing with health issues. If a person is already in a crisis of some form, complementary health care providers try to get to the original cause or source of the problem, rather than dealing with the signs and symptoms of the condition. There are some advantages to not having access to radical procedures to remedy problems that have been previously unattended. Vigilance and attention become the major tools of work, instead of reaction and suppression.	
<BR><BR>What is a complementary health care provider? A good complementary practitioner is capable of making sound health care decisions based on understanding and knowledge of all of the components of a person's make-up. There should be consideration of not only the physical, but also the intellectual, emotional and spiritual aspects. Practitioners should have knowledge of a wide range of health care opportunities that may be appropriate for an individual, as well as have access and communication with others in the health care arena.	<BR><BR>Complementary health care practitioners should still have accountability for their actions and advice to ensure you that the practitioner is up to date with their education and has some type of peer review mechanism to ensure the safety of the public and the consumer.	
<BR><BR>The definition listed here is not an exclusive one, but rather is advice concerning the criteria suggested if you plan to see a complementary health care practitioner. The list of possible people that you may consult is almost endless in an effort to achieve personal wholeness and satisfaction of all facets of your entire self. Your ethnic, cultural, and spiritual belief background must be accommodated if you are to gain truly satisfactory health care.	
<BR><BR>The popular "arrival" of complementary health care is an interesting phenomenon and signals a huge change in the psyche of the population. The ongoing survival of complementary health care systems will be dependent on the will of the individual to take responsibility for his/her own health and a continuing demand for preventive rather than reactive health care measures.

<A NAME="Electro"</A><P><H1>Electromagnetic Fields and Your Immune System</H1>
 <H3> by Michael R. Neuert, MA, BSME</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
As compared to conventional medicine, with its expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of symptoms, the value of a more holistic approach may be the recognition and treatment of the underlying conditions that allow "dis-ease" to exist. This article deals with one of the most controversial, yet perhaps most prevalent dis-ease conditions today: the bio-effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs).	

<BR><BR>EMFs are a type of low-frequency radiation emitted from everything electrical around us: power lines, transformers, electrical wiring, computers, TVs, lights, clocks, appliances, etc. Recent studies have linked EMFs to increased leukemia, lymphoma, brain cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, miscarriage, birth defects, suicide, and most recently, Alzheimer's disease. This wide range of health problems may be due to EMFs' effects on the pineal gland, which is the master gland of the body, secreting hormones which control our circadian rhythms, and regulate important functions of the brain and all the other glands.

<BR><BR>Researchers have discovered that EMFs can suppress the pineal glands' secretion of melatonin, a hormone which controls our wake/sleep cycle, moods and task performance. Depressed melatonin levels are associated with mood changes, depression and psychiatric disorders. Melatonin also plays a critical cancer role, by increasing the phytotoxicity of the body's natural killer lymphocytes. Suppression of pineal gland function has been implicated in the etiology of breast, ovarian, prostate and melanoma cancers.	

<BR><BR>Other studies have linked EMFs to decreased production of enzymes called "protein kinases" in human lymphocyte cells. This also indicates that EMFs can suppress the immune system. Now, if EMFs can suppress the immune system to the point where cancer rates double or triple, what other effects might a suppressed immune system have on our day-to-day health and well being? Do we experience more colds, more allergies, and more susceptibility to other seemingly unrelated medical problems? Are we less capable of handling chemical pollution from the environment?	

<BR><BR>And today, considering the prevalence of immune related disorders---from allergies to AIDS---wouldn't it be wise to support (rather than suppress) the immune system? A natural, holistic approach to health would suggest reducing EMFs as much as reasonably possible. 	

<BR><BR>Researchers have raised important concerns about both the electric and the magnetic components of EMF emissions. However, the greater concern is focused on the magnetic part, because repeated studies have linked magnetic field levels to increased childhood cancer deaths.	

<BR><BR>Most magnetic field exposures come from power lines and electrical wiring. Other common sources are waterbeds, electric blankets, computers, fluorescent lights, TVs, telephones, appliances and automobiles. To detect magnetic fields, you can buy or rent a gaussmeter, or have a professional perform an inspection. Reductions can be as simple as avoiding high exposure locations. Electrical wiring can be repaired to installed according to low-EMF methods. Specific sources can be shielded. Low emission computers, telephones and appliances are becoming available.	

<BR><BR>Anecdotal evidence indicated that AC (alternating current) electric fields are often involved when people are knowingly "sensitive" to electricity. Often referred to as "wired and tired," they may experience conditions ranging from a rather vague discomfort or irritation. to headaches, fatigue and other symptoms.	

<BR><BR>In my observation, almost everyone today experiences an underlying level of "wired and tired" due to electric fields. Some individuals handle it better, perhaps having a stronger resistance to life's stresses. Others are more sensitive, and in extreme cases may experience allergies, depression, environmental illness, or chronic fatigue syndrome. If you are the type of person who feels better when the electricity suddenly goes off during a power failure, or when walking out in the woods away from any electricity, you may be sensitive to electric fields.	

<BR><BR>Most electric field exposures come from building wiring. The remainder come from cords, appliances and nearby power lines. Electric fields are easy to reduce. Walls and ceilings can be painted with special shielded paint. New electrical wiring can be installed using shielded materials. In many homes, certain electrical circuits can be switched off at night, reducing the fields during sleep.

<A NAME="Breast"</A><P><H1>Alternatives for Breast Cancer Treatment</H1>
 <H3> by Tara Treasurfield</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>In February of 1994, I had a mammogram. I was surprised when the radiology department of my HMO flew into a panic. Hysterical hospital personnel left "URGENT!" messages for me at work. The calls terrified me, and I knew that if I did have cancer, fear could only make matters worse. The calls also enraged me, as they violated my privacy, so I fired my HMO.	

<BR><BR>Under a new HMO, I selected a holistically-oriented physician. When the lump on my breast had grown alarmingly two months after the mammogram, he recommended a lump biopsy. It disturbed me that he offered no alternative. But he had all the right credentials and said that the procedure was simple and virtually painless, so I decided to trust his judgment. We selected a surgeon and I made an appointment.	

<BR><BR>Things did not go well. Six hours after the surgery, I was in tremendous pain. The incision had filled with blood, causing a hematoma. A few days after the biopsy, the surgeon told me over the telephone that the biopsy revealed the presence of cancer. He recommended more surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. He also told me that there was no way to relieve the pain from the hematoma, and guessed correctly that it would last for several months. He was actually surprised that all this bad news upset me, so I fired him.	

<BR><BR>My physician tentatively recommended more surgery, combined with radiation. This time, I decided not to follow his advice.	

<BR><BR>I felt as though my nightmares, of which there were many, had overflowed into waking life. My holistic physician, two surgeons, an acupuncturist and herbalist, my friends, casual acquaintances, and my family were unanimous in the opinion that surgery, radiation and chemotherapy were my only options. At one point, I seriously considered a mastectomy. Then in a dream, I saw the dark figure of a human form with little bits and pieces of its flesh lopped away. Awakening from this dream, I realized that if cutting, burning or poisoning my body were the only ways to deal with my predicament, then life just may not be worth living. I was shocked to discover that death was beginning to look appealing, and this discovery woke me up.	

<BR><BR>Convinced that there must me another way, I arranged to visit a friend of 30 years who now lives in Ukiah, California. After a few hours with her, I felt like ME again, instead of a cancerous breast. She inspired me to hope, laugh, and choose to live. She reminded me that there really are alternative to conventional western medicine.	

<BR><BR>Soon after that, I told a new friend about my condition and she invited me to a meeting of the Gerson network. There are people follow the Gerson therapy that were diagnosed as "terminal" as much as 30 years ago. Other approaches work, too. One of my business contacts in Napa, California was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 6 months to live. He quit his job, and spent what he thought were to be the last 6 months of his life helping his wife open an antique store. A year later, he was still alive, got a job, and became deeply involved in his work. That was 14 years ago!	

<BR><BR>After hearing the stories of these wonderful people and realizing that my life may not be over after all, I shared my excitement with my physician. He responded that none of the options I was so excited about really works, so I fired him. Two months later, I dropped my insurance, both because I could no longer afford it, and because it was of no further use to me. Currently, I am treating my condition with a modified Gerson therapy, combined with herbal supplements and mental training.<BR><BR>

<B>1) Deal with the Basics</B><BR><BR>
Don't take the chance of adding more chemicals and toxins to your body. Eat only organic foods. If you eat flesh and/or dairy products, make sure they are free of antibiotics and growth hormones. Drink only filtered or distilled water. Store food and water in glass, not plastic. Use only non-toxic household cleansers and pest control products, and cosmetics that are free of chemicals. You can do this, with the help of your local natural foods market.<BR><BR>

<B>2) Be Honest, Be Selfish</B><BR><BR>
For every relationship, encounter, TV or radio program, piece of music, situation, thought, and feeling, pose the question, "Is this contributing to my healing?" If the answer is no, let it go.

<BR><BR><B>3) Transform Fear and Think Positive</B><BR>
Max Gerson wrote, "More people die of fear than of cancer." Dr. Bernie Siegel also speaks often and eloquently of the devastating effects of fear.	When fears assail you, use whatever method you can to move quickly to a place of peace and confidence. Turn to friends or family for comfort. Trust that God, or Goddess, or the Higher Power, has everything under control. Read, read, read, and listen to inspirational audiotapes. Anything by Louise Hay, Dr. Bernie Siegel and Norman Vincent Peale, and Teach Only Love, by Gerald Jampolsky and Wellness Workbook by Travis and Ryan.

<BR><BR>Be aware of your dreams as well. Dream imagery reflects our deepest beliefs, and we tend to get what we deeply believe. If you have negative dream imagery, take the time to change it through writing, artwork or visualization.

<BR><BR><B>4) Establish a Support System</B><BR>
Comparing notes with those who face similar challenges can help you avoid their mistakes and reassure you when your "alarming symptoms" are actually a healing response.	

<BR><BR>The more honest and open you are with friends and family members, the more they will be able to help you. I knew that I had good friends, but until I shared this challenge with them, I had no idea how good they really were.<BR><BR>

<I>Someone wrote, "We are all dying. It's just that some of us are dying faster than others."</I>	

<BR><BR>I don't know if the treatment program I am following will allow me to live longer or cause me to die sooner. 		
Of course I want to live, but for me, that is not the most important point. That's hard for many of the people who care about me to understand. But more than anything else, I want to deepen my trust in process---the kind of trust that's reflected in a line from Desiderata: Ò"Éand whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should."	

<BR><BR>I am only one cell in the body of Gaia, and I don't know how I figure in the overall plan. I do know that the dis-ease in my body has volumes to teach me about believing in myself, claiming my power and authority, looking terror squarely in the face, and relating fully to other people.	That doesn't mean that I want to keep this dis-ease around. I intend to get rid of it, by listening closely to what it's telling me about my life--and changing. If I can pull that off, whether I live to be only 51, or reach 85 or 90, won't matter so much. At least I will have lived.<BR>	<I>Tara Treasurefield is a dream consultant and writer in Glen Ellen, California</I>.
