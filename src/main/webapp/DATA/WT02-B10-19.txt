<h2 align="center">DRAXIS Health Inc. to Acquire Balance of </h2>
<h2 align="center">Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc.</h2>
<p><b>TORONTO AND KANSAS CITY, July 25, 1996 - </b>Draxis Health
Inc. (TSE:DAX NASDAQ:DRAXF) and Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc.
(NASD OTC Bulletin Board: DAHI; Toronto Stock Exchange: DAH)
jointly announced today that DRAXIS will offer to acquire the
shares of Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc. (DAHI) not already owned
by DRAXIS through a friendly tender offer. DRAXIS presently holds
44% of the outstanding common shares of DAHI and DAHI convertible
debt that if converted would result in DRAXIS' holdings in DAHI
increasing to 52%.</p>
<p>The board of directors of Overland Park, Kansas-based DAHI
today reviewed the offer and voted to recommend its acceptance by
DAHI shareholders. The transaction was previously approved by the
Toronto-based DRAXIS board of directors.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the transaction, DRAXIS would exchange 1.35
shares of DRAXIS common stock for each outstanding share of DAHI
not already owned by DRAXIS. The board of directors of DRAXIS and
DAHI established independent committees to review the
transaction. The independent committee of DRAXIS retained
Montgomery Securities to advise the committee with respect to the
transaction. Hambrecht and Quist LLC was retained by, advised,
and provided a fairness opinion for the independent committee of
DAHI. In addition, an independent valuation on behalf of the
public shareholders of DAHI will be provided by KPMG Peat Marwick
Thorne. The final recommendation of the independent committee to
the board of directors of DRAXIS and DAHI was accepted by both
companies' boards and is being recommended by both companies to
their shareholders. Special meetings of the shareholders of the
two companies will be held in the fall to vote on the
transaction. </p>
<p>Dr. Martin Barkin, M.D., president and CEO of DRAXIS and
chairman of DAHI, stated that uniting the two companies will
allow DRAXIS to continue to support its former spin-off and
accelerate DAHI's growth to profitability by providing additional
financial and marketing support. &quot;No changes will take place
in the winning team that brought DAHI to this point,&quot; he
said. &quot;I am confident that this transaction will free DAHI's
leadership to focus on what is has done so well - develop
Anipryl&#174; and other compounds from conception to
marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>After the completion of the transaction, Dr. David R. Stevens,
D.V.M., president and CEO of DAHI, will become President of
Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc., which will then have become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of DRAXIS. Dr. Stevens will continue to
lead DAHI's further development of Anipryl&#174; for cognitive
dysfunction in pet dogs, its outlicensing beyond North America,
and its marketing and sales in North America. Dr. Stevens
welcomed the formalization of support that DRAXIS had been giving
DAHI over the past two years. &quot;DAHI will now have the
necessary resources to assure a successful launch of
Anipryl&#174; in the U.S. and anywhere else Anipryl&#174; gains
regulatory approval,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;This merger of
talent and finance bodes well for DAHI and DRAXIS
shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>Besides approval by the two companies' shareholders, the
transaction is also subject to approval of the appropriate
regulatory authorities. As a result of the proposed transaction,
DRAXIS, which has been funding the operating requirements of DAHI
over the past two years through periodic issuance of convertible
debt, will now directly assure sufficient funds to expeditiously
complete the regulatory approvals of Anipryl&#174;, and to assure
a successful launch of Anipryl&#174; in the U.S. as soon as a
regulatory approval is received.</p>
<p>DAHI was originally spun off by DRAXIS in 1991 to develop
Anipryl&#174;, a specific formulation of l-selegiline, for the
treatment of certain specified disorders of companion animals.
DAHI has developed Anipryl&#174; for the treatment of canine
Cushing's disease, a disorder that affects more than 160,000 pet
dogs in North America alone. DAHI received approval from the
Canadian government in late 1995 to market Anipryl&#174; in
Canada for canine Cushing's disease. It awaits similar approval
from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration. DAHI applied in May
of 1996 to the Canadian health authorities for permission to
market Anipryl&#174; for canine cognitive dysfunction, an
Alzheimer's-like disease in geriatric dogs that affects up to 10
times as many dogs in North America as does canine Cushing's
disease.</p>
<p>DRAXIS Health Inc., based in Toronto, Canada, is a leading
Canadian pharmaceutical company focused on neurological,
dermatological and veterinary markets in Canada and the United
States.</p>
<p>DAHI, based in Overland Park, Kansas, was established in 1990
to develop animal health applications of Anipryl&#174;. The
company is engaged in identifying other animal health product
opportunities to become a multi-product animal health
pharmaceutical company.</p>
