<P>
A Beacon Account is a fee-based investment
program designed to team individual investors and Investment Executives
as partners working to make portfolio decisions. A Beacon Account
is a traditional brokerage account, however, instead of paying
a commission on each transaction, you pay one simple, annual fee
based on the total amount of assets in your account. What does
it mean to you? You no longer need to hesitate to make trades
because of transaction costs. Instead, the focus is on guiding
your assets toward your long-term growth objectives, not on costs.
The program offers professional guidance in defining your investment
objectives; investment suggestions and opinions based on comprehensive
research sources; and enhanced reporting including asset allocation
analysis; and capital gains, return and risk comparisons. A minimum
investment of $100,000 is required.
