<BR><BR>
Q.  What is the objective of the TimeTech program?<BR><BR>
A.  To provide income-oriented investors with an 
above-average current yield, to participate in market 
advances, and most importantly, to protect and preserve 
capital during a market decline.<BR><BR><BR>
Q. What is the minimum investment?<BR><BR>
A.  $25,000<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  What mutual funds are used?<BR><BR>
A.  Any high yield bond mutual fund or variable annuity 
with a high yield option that has good performance can 
be used, provided it allows unrestricted, cost effective 
exchanges to its corresponding money market fund.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  How does the TimeTech program work?<BR><BR>
A.  TimeTech's computer model keeps you invested in the 
high yield bond fund while market conditions remain 
favorable.  When interest rates start trending up and 
bond values start to decline, the TimeTech program issues 
a "sell" signal and orders an exchange or switch into 
the safe harbor of the mutual fund's money market account.  
When market conditions improve, the program issues a "buy" 
and switches you back into the high yield fund again.
<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  How many times per year can I expect Time Tech to move in 
and out of the fund?<BR><BR>
A.  It's impossible to predict the future, but since 
TimeTech's inception in 1989, clients have averaged approximately 
3 round-trip exchanges per year.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  What is TimeTech's fee structure?<BR><BR>
A.  The fee structure is as follows:<BR><BR>
<CENTER>Amount Under Advisory Management</CENTER>
<UL><L1><CENTER>On the first $200,000 the annual fee is 1.2%</CENTER>
    <L1><CENTER>On the next $300,000 the annual  fee is 1.0%</CENTER>
    <L1><CENTER>On the excess the annual fee is .8%</CENTER>
</UL><BR>
One quarter of the annual fee is billed each quarter in advance.  
The fee may be paid or deducted (only with your 
permission) from your account.
<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  What are the charges on each exchange?<BR><BR>
A.  Because TimeTech always remains within the same 
mutual fund family, there are no commissions on exchanges.  
Most funds or brokerage accounts charge a nominal $5 to 
$10 fee to provide the exchange.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  Can I cancel my TimeTech management program at any time?<BR><BR>
A.  Yes.  Our cancellation policy is covered in the management
agreement.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  Is the TimeTech program appropriate for retirement accounts?<BR><BR>
A.  Yes.  The program works well with retirement accounts as well 
as with regular accounts.  TimeTech creates high current income and 
each exchange is a capital transaction: therefore, tax-deferred 
accounts avoid current taxation and allow your portfolio to compound
aat higher rates.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  What is the liquidity of the program?<BR><BR>
A.  Currently, mutual funds may redeem shares within three business
days.  Thus, if you need money quickly, it is available.  Actual 
redemption policys of a mutual fund are governed by its prospectus
which should be consulted.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  What reports will I receive?<BR><BR>
A.  Each transaction will produce a confirmation.  You will also
receive regular statements from the brokerage firm or mutual fund
company.  Each quarter, TimeTech will provide you with a performance 
report for the quarter, for the year to date, and for the total period
that TimeTech has managed your account.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  Aren't high yield bond fund investment risky?<BR><BR>
A.  The portfolio managers of high yield bond funds research the 
credit worthiness of bonds very carefully before adding them to the 
fund's portfolio.  They aso monitor those bonds in the portfolio 
continuously.  In addition, most high yield bond funds diversify for 
safety into a broad number of binds, sometimes with as many as several
hundred different issues.  This greatly reduces the risk of individual
credit defaults.  The issuers of high yield bonds are classically
of lower credit qualityand therefore higher risk.  Investors are
compensated for that risk with a higher current yield.<BR><BR><BR>
Q.  How do I open an account?<BR><BR>
A.  Your broker, registered representitive or financial planner can
assist you in choosing a high yield bond fund that meets your 
objectives and that fits TimeTech's parameters.  Once TimeTech has 
received and approved your management agreement, your account will 
be up and running.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="th08.jpg"><BR><BR>
