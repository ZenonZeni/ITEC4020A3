<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/risingbondyields_subhead.gif" ALT="Why Is The Dollar Weak?"><BR>
The primary focus of the foreign exchange market during the next few weeks will be the relationship between the German mark and French franc.
<P>
The franc is under pressure because of growing investor concern about the prospects for European monetary union occurring on schedule in 1999.  The German economy is showing signs of recovery while the French economy remains lackluster.  As a result, it will be difficult for the French government to achieve its target of a fiscal deficit equal to 3.0% of GDP in 1997 unless it can enact further large cuts in public spending or tax hikes.  Such fiscal restraint will be unpopular because the tax share of GDP in France is already 55% while French unions have threatened to go on strike if the government pursues further large reductions in government payrolls and entitlement programs.  The Bundesbank has attempted to boost the franc and reduce upward pressure on the D-mark by lowering German interest rates 30 basis points but the market shrugged off the move because of perceptions that it will be Germany's last interest rate cut and awareness that France confronts such serious  fiscal problems that monetary fine tuning, alone, will be insufficient to resolve them.  The market is also apprehensive about the possible impact of a parliamentary investigation into the Credit Lyons scandal on the status of Jean Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France.  The office of President Chirac denies that Mr. Trichet is vulnerable to the inquiry, but investors are apprehensive because Mr. Trichet has been the architect of French economic policy for several years.  Investors fear that if he were to leave, France might abandon its commitment to monetary union.
<P>
There are four possible solutions to the franc's problems.  First, the French economy could enjoy a stronger than expected recovery during 1997 in response to this year's monetary easing and produce an upsurge of tax receipts which would lower the budget deficit to 3.0-3.5% of GDP from 4.5% this year.  Secondly, the French government could be successful in enacting large cuts in public spending and achieve its fiscal target despite sluggish growth of the economy.  Thirdly, Chancellor Kohl could attempt to persuade other European governments and the German people to relax the budget deficit targets specified in the Maastricht Treaty on the grounds that France is moving in the right direction and that any delay of monetary union would create the risk of the whole project being deferred indefinitely.  Finally, France and Germany could agree to delay monetary union for one year on technical grounds but make it clear that the whole project will go ahead in the year 2000.
<P>
The most likely scenario at present is a combination of scenarios two and three.  The French government will succeed in enacting some spending cuts and Chancellor Kohl will try to persuade other governments to go ahead with European monetary union if the French deficit is less than 4.0% of GDP.  The positive surprise for the markets would be that the European monetary easing of the past two years produces a stronger than expected upturn which permits France and other countries to come closer to the Maastricht fiscal targets than now seems possible.
<P>
As a result of the monetary union issue, the bond markets of many European countries will behave quite differently than the U.S. bond market during the next twelve months.  In the U.S., the bond market now slumps whenever economic data shows signs of strength.  American bond investors dislike strong growth because the economy is close to full employment and it increases the risk of Federal Reserve tightening.  In Europe, by contrast, stronger economic growth helps to reduce government fiscal deficits and thus enhances the prospects of monetary union.  The currencies and bond markets which are most vulnerable to a collapse if monetary union is deferred are those which have used the goal of monetary union as a lever for pursuing deficit reduction, including France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.  While Italy, Spain, and other southern European countries will not be in the first wave of monetary union, they will be pursuing a fiscal and monetary stabilization pact with the countries of the union in order to lay the groundwork for admission later.  Any setback to the monetary union project would therefore provoke investor concern about the ability of the governments in Rome, Madrid, and elsewhere to adhere to the macroeconomic targets which will be pursued in conjunction with the stabilization pact.  
<P>
The pressures on European exchange rates resulting from the uncertainties about monetary union caused investors to buy the D-mark and the Swiss franc at the expense of other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, during August.  The dollar also suffered from the failure of  the Fed to tighten monetary policy during late August, but the resilience of the U.S.equity market limited the damage resulting from the Fed's passivity.
