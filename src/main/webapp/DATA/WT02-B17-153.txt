<h2>CSTRR Solar Power Opportunities Workshop</h2>

The Corporation for Solar Technologies and Renewable Resources
is a non-profit corporation working to commercialize solar technologies
and advance the solar industry in southern Nevada and globally.
 The Department of Energy encouraged the establishment of CSTRR
and a Solar Enterprise Zone to serve as a site where private industry
could develop solar and other renewable resources to produce competitively
priced energy.
<P>
The Federal Energy Management Program is working with CSTRR to
secure pledges from Federal facilities over the next few months.
 This allows agencies to comply with the Energy Policy Act of
1992 and Executive Order 12902 commitments to significantly increase
the purchase of energy from solar and other renewable resources.
 The Nevada Test Site is already leading the way with 10 MW that
CSTRR is using as a basis for moving ahead with its first project.
 EPA and Yuma Proving Ground have signed Letters of Interest,
and DoD, Interior, USPS, and other agencies and DOE facilities
are near commitments.  The Letter of Interest is a non-binding
agreement for facilities to work with CSTRR and FEMP to analyze
a solar power purchase.  After signing the Letters of Interest,
FEMP will provide technical assistance, contracting, and purchasing
expertise and advice on combining CSTRR power with other energy
improvements to make CSTRR power purchases a competitive part
of a facility's energy portfolio. 
<P>
As part of this assistance, FEMP, the General Services Administration
(GSA), and CSTRR will present a workshop titled "CSTRR Solar
Power Opportunities" on October 29 and 30.  The workshop will
present representatives from government facilities, electric utilities,
and other customers with information regarding the options available
for purchasing CSTRR solar power.  The workshop agenda includes:
an overview of the CSTRR initiative; descriptions of potential
solar projects from the developers; case studies on facilities
that have already agreed to explore purchases of CSTRR power;
and contracting mechanisms for Federal facilities.  Speakers will
include agency officials, CSTRR developers, and DOE staff who
will report on the latest developments and remaining barriers
to CSTRR power purchases.  A partial list of speakers includes:
Hon. Richard Bryan, Senator from Nevada; Mark Ginsberg, Director
of FEMP; Rose McKinney-James, President of CSTRR; Beth Shearer
of GSA; and Millard Carr of DoD.
<P>
CSTRR Solar Power Opportunities will take place at the MGM Grand
Hotel in Las Vegas, NV.  A limited number of rooms has been set
aside for conference participants.  The registration fee is $95.00
payable to NEOS Corporation; 3569 Mt. Diablo Blvd., Suite 200;
Lafayette, CA 94549-3837.  Registration information can be faxed
to: 510-284-3417.
