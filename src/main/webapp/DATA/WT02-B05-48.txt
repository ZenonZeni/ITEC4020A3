CDT ANALYSIS OF REVISED EXON INDECENCY LEGISLATION

I.  OVERVIEW

A revised version of the Communications Decency Act (S.314) was added to the 
Senate telecommunications reform legislation as the reform bill was reported 
out of the Senate Commerce Committee.  In an important improvement over the 
original version, several exemptions have been created to limit criminal 
liability of online services providers where they exercise no control over 
content.  However, despite this significant change the bill is still an 
unconstitutional intrusion of the free speech and privacy rights of Internet 
users and all content providers in interactive media.   (The complete text of 
the bill interleaved into the current statute is attached at the end of this 
Policy Post.)

In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in statute a 
sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  The 
bill subjects interactive media to the same weak First Amendment protections 
that have evolved for mass media.  Moreover, it places all speech that occurs 
on the Internet and elsewhere in cyberspace under the jurisdiction of the 
Federal Communications Commission.  Both the interactive media and the print 
media are arenas in which individuals and organizations exercise core First 
Amendment free speech rights.  Thus, new interactive media -- which includes 
not only email and Internet servicese, but also interactive TV, video on 
demand and distance learning -- must be protected by the First Amendment.

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) remains actively opposed to this 
bill.  With the help of Senator Leahy and other civil liberties advocates in 
Congress, we will fight to keep it from being enacted and continue to search 
for alternatives to this dangerous legislation.  CDT believes that federal 
legislation is needed to solidify free speech rights and clarify online 
service provider liability.  Without such legislation, a series of state 
legislative proposed as bad or worse than the Exon/Gorton bill will 
proliferate.  Restrictive proposals already under consideration in states such 
as Maryland, Oregon, and Washington must be pre-empted.  We will work with 
concerned legislators and the Interactive Working Group (an ad hoc coalition 
of public interest organizations, and computer, communication, and publishing 
firms) to develop alternatives.

II.  ANALYSIS OF CURRENT PROPOSAL

The Exon/Gorton bill was introduced to promote the important purpose of 
protecting minors from access to controversial and inappropriate sexually 
explicit material in interactive media including the Internet, other 
commercial online services, electronic bulletin board services (BBS's).  
However, because the proposed statute is grafted onto a twenty five year-old 
provision of the Communications Act which was designed for a centralized 
monopoly telephone environment, instead of diverse, decentralized interactive 
media, it both fails to accomplish its goal and is unconstitutional on its 
face.  In spite of the changes made by Senator Exon, the bill still suffers 
the following critical defects from the standpoint of users and content 
providers:

1.      SECOND CLASS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS FOR USERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS ON 
        THE NET AND ALL INTERACTIVE MEDIA:  Even though many laud cyberspace as 
        the new electronic gutenberg printing press accessible to all, the Exon 
        bill treats the Internet, interactive television, and video dialtone 
        systems as if they were one big radio station whose broadcasts are 
        constantly assaulting unwilling listeners.  Those who use these new 
        technologies know that this is not the case.  However, viewing 
        interactive media as an extension of broadcasting diminishes the First 
        Amendment rights of all who use these systems and create content for 
        them.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a 
        bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, 
        one would not be able to access the identical information over the 
        Internet if this legislation is enacted.  

2.      FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION JURISDICTION OVER ONLINE SPEECH:  The 
        defenses to prosecution established in the new version of the bill gives
        the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction to establish rules 
        governing distribution of content online.  This will have a dramatic 
        chilling effect on online activity and squelch the development of 
        interactive media.  Regulation of indecency in this new medium is a bad 
        precedent for all kinds of speech in the interactive world.

3.      CRIMINALIZATION OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MESSAGES THAT ARE NOT 
        OBSCENE: The Act criminalizes not only obscene, but also "lewd, 
        lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications, all of which are 
        protected by the First Amendment and cannot be banned.  


4.      IMPERMISSIBLY INTRUSIVE MEANS OF ACHIEVING LEGITIMATE GOAL:  First 
        Amendment jurisprudence requires that restrictions on speech adopt the 
        "least restrictive means" available for achieving a compelling purpose.
        Relying on technological assumptions applicable only to 900 number 
        services and a centrally-controlled telephone system, the Act fails to 
        account for the fact that government restriction on content is 
        unnecessary in interactive media, where parents can control the content 
        that their children access.

5.      FAULTY ANALOGY TO BROADCAST MEDIA: Proponents of the Act have justified
        the constitutionality by improper reliance on content restrictions found
        acceptable in broadcast media. These arguments fail to recognize that 
        while broadcast media may "assult" unwilling listeners, who may be
        in need of government protection, interactive media enables users to
        control the information that they receive.

6.      INVASION OF PRIVACY:  By criminalizing the content of private, non-
        obscene messages, the Act would force an invasion of the realm of 
        private electronic communications and end the individual's ability to 
        control the content of information he or she chooses to access in 
        private.

Alternative means of achieving the goal of protecting minors from access to 
material considered inappropriate by their parents would include:

1.      FEDERAL LEGISLATION ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH ON THE NET: 
        CDT believes that there mujst be federal legislation to solidify free
        speech rights and clarify carrier liability which pre-empts state
        legislation in this area.  Otherwise, as series of state legislative
        proposed where are as bad or worse than the Exon/Gorton bill will
        proliferate.  

2.      MAXIMUM RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER PARENTS:  Interactive media 
        offers parents and other users the ability to filter certain kinds of 
        content.  Instead of relying on government censorship, or even 
        government-imposed rating systems, parents should be able to block the 
        delivery of certain information to their children on the basis of their 
        own individual tastes and preferences.

3.      CLEAR PROTECTION FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY-PERMISSIBLE SPEECH:  Any 
        alternative legislation must provide affirmative protection for 
        constitutionally-permissible speech, even if it is lewd, filthy or 
        otherwise controversial.  The First Amendment demands that offensive or 
        disturbing speech must be treated separately than that which is clearly 
        obscene and unprotected.

4.      EMPHASIS ON ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING STATUTES:  Federal and state law 
        already prohibits transportation of obscenity, child pornography, as 
        well as, in many instances threats, stalking and harassment.  To the 
        extent that there are obstacles to enforcing these laws in the new on-
        line environment, Congress should examine whether new law is required, 
        or whether more resources for enforcement (including training for law 
        enforcement in interactive services and cooperative efforts with the 
        industry).

5.      CODIFICATION SEPARATELY FROM EXISTING DIAL-A-PORN STATUTE:
        Modification of the existing ¤ 223, originally written for the analogue
        telephone system, to regulate new interactive media causes unnecessary 
        confusion, both for the treatment of the new technology and with 
        respect to the stability of the regulation of audiotext services. If new 
        is written, it should stand on its own. Moreover, Congress should 
        consider which elements properly belong in the Communications Act and 
        which in the Criminal Code.

The regulation of speech, commerce, and privacy rights in new interactive 
communications systems raises many difficult issues of public policy and 
constitutional law.  Before proceeding with legislation, Congress must provide 
the opportunity for public hearings to identify clearly the problems that 
exist, and to identify solutions that are appropriate to the new technology.  
Failure to do so will result in ineffective policy, years of constitutional 
litigation, and a disastrous chilling effect on the development and growth of 
a very promising new communications medium.
