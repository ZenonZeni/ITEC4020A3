<font size=4><BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past 25 years, we've helped more than 100,000 men, women, and children succeed in losing weight.  From that experience, we've learned that overweight people face unique physiological and psychological challenges.  Not only are dieters challenged by cravings that cause them to overeat, but often they can't eat normally without gaining weight.<P>

<b>Physiologically, </B>the dieter is often different than a thin person in the way his or her body handles carbohydrates and insulin.  They have become a "fat-storing machine."  Knowing this, Lindora has designed a program to help change the dieter's body chemistry to that of a "fat-burning machine."  Overweight people are also different in that their muscles are typically not as efficient at using stored fat for fuel.  To help counter this condition, Lindora utilizes a unique approach to exercise-- "gentle exercise"--which stimulates your muscle cells to increase their mitochondrial surface.  As a result, your body's ability to burn fat increases.  <p>

<B>Psychologically,</B> dieters must overcome a self-image of fatness to achieve and maintain lean body weight.  Lindora has developed special strategies, tools, and techniques such as a "skinny mirror," affirmation audio tapes, Lean for Life videos, and a monthly patient newsletter to support you in achieving your goal.
