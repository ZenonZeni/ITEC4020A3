UK:  DECISION DUE ON MGN BID

The directors of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the `Independent' and
`Independent on Sunday', may recommend shareholders to accept an
improved takeover bid from a consortium led by Mirror Group Newspapers
which owns over 47 per cent of NP.  A decision was due to be taken on
28th February or 1st March 1994.
Members of the National Union of Journalists at the two titles called
on Ian Hay Davison, chairman of the board of independent directors of
NP, to reject the bid for the company from the MGN consortium because
it failed to guarantee the independence of the titles or provide a
stable framework of ownership and control.
