<P>New York Life Worldwide Holding, Inc., formed in 1988 and located in New York City, is an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company, which was the fourth largest life
insurance company by assets in the United States in 1995.  Through Worldwide Holding, New
York Life and its affiliates conduct business internationally in Argentina, Bermuda, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.  In China, Worldwide Holding
also has representative offices in Guangzhou and Shanghai.

<P><STRONG>Hong Kong - (1988)</STRONG>  New York Life Insurance Worldwide Ltd., located in Hong
Kong, was the first company that Worldwide Holding incorporated to re-enter* the
international marketplace.  This Company has experienced dynamic growth and  in the past year
has doubled its agency force.  Worldwide Holding also has a regional office in Hong Kong to
support operations in the Pacific Rim. (* New York Life Insurance Company had a global
presence more than 100 years ago and had business operations in some 50 to 60 countries prior
to World War I.)<P>

<STRONG>United Kingdom - (1989)</STRONG>  Worldwide Holding began in the U.K. by acquiring
the Windsor group of insurance companies.  It then moved to capitalize on this expertise by
joining with the St. James Place Capital and other investors from the Life Assurance Holding
Corporation, Ltd., which acquires and manages existing insurance companies and their
portfolios.<P>

<STRONG>Indonesia - (1991)</STRONG>  P.T. Asuransi Jiwa Sewu New York Life, with headquarters
in Jakarta, has in just four years moved to number five in market share.  SEWU New York
Life's field force of over 1,500 agents, many of whom are Million Dollar Round Table
qualifiers, includes the top producing agent in all of Indonesia.  Worldwide Holding's
partner in this joint venture is a respected Indonesian company, P.T. Gunung Sewu Kencana.
<P>

<STRONG>Taiwan - (1992)</STRONG>  Worldwide Holding's insurance business in Taiwan is
managed
as a branch of New York Life Insurance &amp; Annuity Corporation.  It has succeeded in a highly
competitive market, and in 1996 it became the only insurance company to have won three
prestigious industry awards in the same year:  "Company of the Year," "Product of the Year,"
and "Man of the Year".<P>

<STRONG>Mexico - (1993)</STRONG>  New York Life Worldwide Holding acquired an interest in the
OLMECA Group's life insurance business, which is located in Mexico City.  The new company,
GEO New York Life, opened for business in the Fall of 1993.  In spite of the challenging
market conditions in Mexico, GEO has consistently made its market goals through aggressive
recruiting and excellent training for its field force.<P>

<STRONG>South Korea - (1993)</STRONG>  In South Korea, Worldwide Holding joined with KOHAP,
a
large textile conglomerate, to establish a joint venture company, KOHAP New York Life
Insurance Ltd.  As a newly established company in a very competitive environment, KOHAP NYL
has succeeded by distinguishing itself in its excellent training and development of its field
force.  As a result of this and strong recruiting efforts, the field force has nearly doubled
in the past year.<P>

<STRONG>Argentina - (1994)</STRONG>  When Argentina's social security system was privatized,
Worldwide Holding moved aggressively to gain a strategic position in the marketplace.  It
purchased interests in three Argentinean financial services companies,
including La Buenos Aires New York Life Vida and La Buenos Aires New York Life Retiro, a life
insurance and an annuity company respectively.  By year end 1995, La Buenos Aires New York
Life Vida ranked number two in life insurance sales in Argentina.<P>

<STRONG>Bermuda - (1995)</STRONG>  To meet the demands of another global market
opportunity, Worldwide Holding formed New York Life Worldwide (Bermuda) Ltd., an offshore
company, to serve international high net worth individuals and the corporate-owned life
insurance market.  Its products and services are distributed through a select group of
brokers and private banking sponsors.
