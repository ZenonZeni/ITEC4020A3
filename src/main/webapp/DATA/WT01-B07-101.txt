<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this paper, I report the ion transport properties of an elastomeric hydrogel made of a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer.  The goal is to find a sulfonation that will provide the polymer gel with a maximum conductivity for applications as an ion-conductive membrane and an electromechanically responsive material for an artificial muscle.  The first step to this goal was to test the conductivity of the polymer in the H+, Na+, and ferrocenated forms, each in 0.1, 1 and 2M NaCl solutions.  These values were compared to the conductivity values of a Nafion-117 polymer gel in the acid (H+) and neutralized (Na+) forms in the three solutions, and the conductivity values of the solution alone.  The styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer in the acid form was the most conductive of the three forms.  The 2M NaCl solution produced higher conductivities than the more dilute solutions.  The acid form of the polymer gel was the most conductive; the neutralized form was less than the acid form, but approximately equal to the conductivities of the solution alone without a polymer; and the ferrocenated polymer was the most resistive.<p>
<br>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the past two years, <a href="gary.htm"><B>Dr. Gary Wnek</B></a> and his undergraduate research team have been investigating this elastomeric, heavily sulfonated triblock polymer.  They discovered that when a DC electric field was applied, the gel bent toward the negative electrode.  The gel swelled more as the degree of sulfonation increased.  They also found that the maximum bending angle of the gel ocurred at 0.02M Na2SO4 solution concentration. (1)<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has been discovered in research on polymethacrylic acid membranes, that a change of ionization state of the membrane can alter insulin flux (2) and reverse hydration in the membrane and permeability to solutes (3).  An application of a DC electric field of 6V/cm was tested on polymethacrylic acid gels containing philocarpin.  The field induced the release of the drug into the surrounding bath (4).  Ionization state, cross-link density, and gel swelling are critical to determining whether the polymer gel Dr. Wnek's research group is investigating could have selectively augmented macromolecular transport properties by electrodiffusion, electroosmosis, and electrophoresis.<p>

	<br>
<h3>EXPERIMENTAL</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sulfonated polymer was obtained as a gift from the DAIS Corp. and is now available from the Aldrich Chemical Co. (cat. # 44888-5).  <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Several impedance tests using AC voltage were run on the polymer gel.  The gel was mounted, first, by a lateral conductivity method, which attaches the platinum electrodes directly to the gel (5).  The conductivity and resistivity were calculated for each run.  The tests started with a 41% sulfonated gel batch.  The impedance test was run with the gel immersed in distilled water.  The gel was then placed in an excess NaOH solution for twenty-three hours to neutralize the gel.  This neutralized membrane was tested with the lateral conductivity method, just as before.  The gel was then placed in an excess solution of ferrocene for eighteen hours and was then was before.  The same tests were run again for a batch of gels having a sulfonation level of 57%.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A new test cell was formed, which was named the 
<a href = "images/doublel.gif"><B>"Double-L" cell</B></a>.  It was named this, because it looks like two letter "L"s facing each other with an O-ring in between them.  This cell was constructed to test the conductivity and resistivity of the gel, which was between the two "L"s, and which was filled with different concentrations of solutions.  The platinum electrodes each were placed through the top of each the "L"s to sit at ninety degree angles two the cell.  The electrodes in this method are not directly connected to the gel.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The conductivity was tested for 0.1M KCl solution without the membrane at 21.5 degrees C.  From this, an average cell constant was determined, in order to calculate the conductivity of the gel in the new cell.  The measured cell constant was 2.952/cm.  The cell constant does not have a dependence to polymer type, solution, or concentration of a solution.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tests were run on the polymer in the acid form in distilled water for the "Double-L" cell method.  Then the polymer was tested three times while in the acid form, twice in the neutralized form, and once in the ferrocenated form.  The acid and neutralized forms of a Nafion-117 polymer were tested once.  The polymer gel and the Nafion-117 gel in their specific forms were immersed and tested for each of these three solutions in the "Double-L" cell: 0.1M, 1M, and 2M solutions of NaCl.  The conductivity and resistance were measured for these solutions without a polymer gel in between the "L"s, in order to determine what effect the polymer had on the conductivity and resistance.<p>

<br>
<h3>DISCUSSION OF RESULTS</h3>     
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 41% and 57% sulfonated styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer tests, did not produce a trend in the conductivity.  The 57% sulfonated polymer had higher values for conductivity for the neutralized and ferrocenated forms, than the 41% sulfonated polymer.  However, the 41% sulfonated polymer had a higher conductivity that the 57% sulfonated polymer.  There are no reproductions of these tests, so the values may not be accurate.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The acid form was the most conductive of the three forms.  
<a href="images/condchg.gif"><B>Figure 1</B></a> shows the change in the values of the conductivity measured with the polymer gel from the values measured without the polymer.  From 
<a href="images/01molar.gif"><B>Figure 2</B></a>, 
<a href="images/1molar.gif"><B>Figure 3</B></a>, and 
<a href="images/2molar.gif"><B>Figure 4</B></a>, one can see that the acid form of the polymer was the most conductive; the neutralized form's conductivities were less than the acid form, but approximately equal to the conductivities of the solution alone; and the ferrocenated polymer was the most resistive.  The 2M NaCl solution produced higher conductivities than the more dilute solutions.<p> 
<br>
<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One cannot assume that the sulfonation level does not have an effect on the conductivity of the polymer.  There have not been enough tests performed on the different sulfonation levels.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, it was to be determined what ion exchange in the polymer produced the highest conductivity results.  The acid form, from the tests run on the polymer and the Nafion-117 gel, produced the highest conductivity values.  The results show that the polymer consistently produced higher conductivity values than the Nafion-117 gel.  It is concluded from the observation that the polymer gel shrunk when ferrocenated, one can conclude that the substitution of the ferrocene ion to the polymer renders the polymer more hydrophobic.  The hydrophobicity of this form of the polymer gel caused the polymer to reject the water, with which the polymer was hydrated.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The accuracy of the "Double-L" cell tests, may not be desirable.  The concentrations of the solutions were not always exactly the same when mixed, because when the NaCl was measured out, the weight was not precise (range = 0.06%).  The acid form conductivity values were and average of the three tests.  However, the neutralized form was only the values of one trial.  The ferrocenated form was only the one set of values that was tested.<p>
<br>
<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to determine the sulfonation level that will provide the polymer with a maximum conductivity, more tests must be conducted to determine the accuracy of the measured conductivity values.  Also, the effect of neytralizing cations on conductivity needs to be studied in more detail.<p>
