<h1><center>The National Day of Protest Against Internet Censorship Legislation Is Huge Success!</h1></center>
<p>
<font size = +1>
On Tuesday December 12 1995, over 20,000 concerned net.citizens flooded key members 
of Congress with phone calls, faxes, and email messages urging them to oppose
legislation which would prohibit the transmission of "indecent" material online. This was the largest demonstration of the strength of the Internet Community to date. Thank you to 
those who participated.
<p>
Congress has not yet completed work on the final Telecommunications Reform Legislation, which includes the Communications Decency Act. There is still time to contact your representatives in Congress and urge them to protect the Internet and preserve its potential for democracy, education, and commerce. You will find information on what you can do to help below. It is never too late to get involved!
