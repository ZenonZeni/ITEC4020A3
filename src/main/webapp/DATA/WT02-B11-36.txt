<title>The Northern Miner - Bema and Arizona Star expand mineralization at Aldebaran</title>
<h2>The Northern Miner Vol. 82 No. 47 January 20, 1997</h2>
<h3>Bema and Arizona Star expand mineralization at Aldebaran</h3>
<p>
<strong>by Rob Robertson</strong><p>
<strong>VANCOUVER</strong> - Deep drilling at the Aldebaran property in northern Chile indicates thatthe Cerro Casale gold-copper zone is much wider and deeper than initiallyprojected.
<p>
Owership of the property is shared by Arizona Star Resource (AZS-V) and
Bema Gold (BGO-T), with 51% and 49% interests, respectively. Their current
drill program is attempting to confirm the grade of the main porphyry zone.
<p>
Earlier estimates had suggested the diorite porphyry body averages 800 metres
in length and 300 metres in width, with a depth of at least 750 metres.
<p>
Primary mineralization in the main porphyry has consistently averaged grades
in the range of 0.9 gram gold per tonne and 0.35% copper.
<p>
The porphyry body outcrops at surface in the form of an oxidized gold deposit
on the northeastern side of a talus-covered hillside at an elevation of 4,460
metres. Based on the previous drilling of more than 200 holes, the oxide
portion is estimated to contain an reserve, minable by open-pit methods, of
93.8 million tonnes grading 0.65 gram gold. The transition from oxide to
sulphide mineralization occurs at a depth of about 300 metres.
<p>
With four diamond drill rigs currently on site, the partners are attempting
to define the extent of the main porphyry sulphide mineralization, which
remains open to the south and at depth.
<p>
Results were recently received from 12 deep drill holes, the most significant
of which are holes 44 and 48, which are major stepouts to the south. The
values encountered in these holes, when combined with results from previously
drilled hole 30 (382 metres of 1 gram gold and 0.26% copper), indicate the
main porphyry zone expands to a 600-metre width over a strike length of at
least 100 metres.
<p>
Hole 44 was drilled vertically, well south of the outcropping southern
boundary. From a depth of 144-300 metres, the hole encountered 156 metres
averaging 0.47 gram gold and 0.38% copper before intersecting 494 metres of
1.03 grams gold and 0.29% copper beginning at a depth of 300 metres. The hole
continued to a depth of 1,346 metres, yielding 552 metres of mineralized
volcanics and porphyry averaging 0.38 gram gold and 0.24% copper.
<p>
Hole 44 was drilled vertically, well south of the outcropping southern
boundary. From a depth of 144-300 metres, the hole encountered 156 metres
averaging 0.47 gram gold and 0.38% copper before intersecting 494 metres of
1.03 grams gold and 0.29% copper beginning at a depth of 300 metres. The hole
continued to a depth of 1,346 metres, yielding 552 metres of mineralized
volcanics and porphyry averaging 0.38 gram gold and 0.24% copper.
<p>
Hole 44 had been projected to hit the main zone at a depth of about 480
metres but instead cut the structure substantially higher up, at a depth of
300 metres. This shows that the zone extends much nearer to surface than the
companies anticipated.
<p>
Hole 48 stepped out farther to the southwest and intersected 306 metres of
lower-grade mineralization between a depth of 132-438 metres averaging 0.4
gram gold and 0.11% copper before cutting 388 metres of the main porphyry
grading 0.95 gram gold and 0.28% copper between 438 and 826 metres.
<p>
The hole then passed through a 236-metre interval of mineralized volcanics at
a depth of 826-1,062 metres averaging 0.4 gram gold and 0.21% copper before
encountering the main porphyry zone again at a depth of 1,062-1,206 metres,
returning 144 metres of 0.86 gram gold and 0.31% copper.
<p>
During a conference call to mining analysts, Thomas Garagan, Bema's
vice-president of exploration, alluded to the potential size of the deposit:
"It would appear, [based on] these results from holes 44 and 48, that 500
million tonnes is probably a conservative estimate. It is certainly heading
in the plus direction both at depth and to the south."
<p>
A further six holes drilled into the main porphyry zone returned results
similar to values previously reported. The western end of the porphyry was
tested by holes 38, 39 and 42. Hole 39 intersected the western edge,
returning 140 metres at a depth of 684-824 metres grading 0.7 gram gold and
0.35% copper. No values were reported for holes 38 and 42, which were drilled
outside the main zone.
<p>
Additional intercepts from the main porphyry zone include: 406 meters grading
0.92 gram gold and 0.4% copper between a depth of 488 and 894 metres in hole
43; 362 metres grading 0.82 gram gold and 0.34% copper between 554 and 916
metres in hole 45; and 402 metres grading 0.94 gram gold and 0.41% copper
from 570-972 metres in hole 47.
<p>
Hole 40 initially intersected the southern edge of the mineralized zone at a
depth of 278-426 metres, returning 148 metres averaging 0.71 gram gold and
0.22% copper. The hole then cut 248 metres of the main zone grading 1.1 grams
gold and 0.43% copper, beginning at a depth of 538 metres.
<p>
Hole 41, drilled at the eastern end of the porphyry, pulled only low-grade
mineralization along the zone's edge.
<p>
Arizona Star and Bema continued to define a zone of higher-grade mineralized
breccia in the main porphyry zone.
<p>
Hole 49 intersected 132 metres grading 3.28 grams gold and 1.17% copper at a
depth of 434-566 metres. The hole proceeded to pass through a 124-metre
interval of porphyry mineralization and localized dykes grading 0.58 gram
gold and 0.35% copper before cutting 90 metres of a central, localized dyke
system containing no significant values. At a depth of 780-984 metres, the
hole intersected 204 metres grading 1.01 grams gold and 0.48% copper.
<p>
Hole 46 missed the targeted breccia zone and instead intersected the southern
edge of the porphyry, returning 582 metres of 0.76 gram gold and 0.34% copper.
<p>
The breccia zone has been intersected previously by drill holes 19 (242.2
metres of 4.22 grams gold and 1.14% copper), 23 (174 metres of 1.7 grams gold
and 0.23% copper), 25 (176 metres of 2.11 grams gold and 0.5% copper) and
RC176 (42 metres of 17.8 grams gold and 1.5% copper).
<p>
The higher-grade zone remains open along strike both to the east and west,
and at depth. It currently measures 100 metres long, 110 metres wide and at
least 200 metres deep.
<p>
Garagan says that by using more careful mapping techniques and looking at old
drill core, the breccia zone was found to project to surface. Unfortunately,
as the breccia passes into the zone of oxidation, the copper -- and, with it,
the gold -- has been leached from the breccia, thus lowering the grade in the
zone. However, by the very nature of the oxidation process, the metals are
transported downwards and reprecipitated, thus enriching sulphide minerals
already present -- the ramifications being that, with at least three other
breccia zones identified in the oxide portion of the deposit, there may be
potential for other higher-grade pockets elsewhere at depth.
<p>
Given the size of the breccia, its grade and the possibility that it could be
mined early in the mine's life, management is considering going underground
with a 1-2-km-long drift, which would allow for more tightly spaced drilling
on the breccia and the extraction of bulk samples of the breccia and porphyry
for metallurgical testing.
<p>
Arizona Star and Bema have assembled a preliminary mine model to determine
how deeply they can chase the sulphide mineralization, given the average
grades. Using model dimensions of 800 metres long by 300 metres wide (and a
much smaller extension to the south at depth than what the partners are
currently seeing), Bema's vice-president of development and production,
Dennis Stansbury, says the deposit can be mined by open-pit methods at depths
substantially greater than the 750-metre depth that has been talked about. In
the deepest model, with a depth exceeding 1,000 metres, the stripping ratio
is projected at just over 5-to-1.
<p>
Initial metallurgical tests on a large composite sample, comprising 80
sulphide ore samples from various rock types, have yielded no nasty
surprises. Using standard flotation techniques, which simulate rougher
flotation, recoveries averaged 76% gold and 91% copper in six minutes time.
<p>
While the partners are still in the middle of doing these tests, recoveries
appear to be optimized by a grind of 90% passing through 100 mesh, a pH
(hydrogen ion concentration) of 10.8, and the use of only two standard
flotation reagents.
<p>
Additional tests are attempting to evaluate flotation conditions and
determine the final concentrate grades and chemistry.
<p>
Overall gold recovery appears to be boosted by cyanide leaching on the
flotation tails. Initial results indicate that half of the gold remaining in
the tails can be recovered.
<p>
A preliminary gravity separation test recovered nearly 10% of the gold into a
concentrate. Copper assays are pending, but a substantial amount is
associated with the gold.
<p>
"In our view, the metallurgical results could not have been much more
positive," says Bema President Clive Johnson. "We have what we hoped -- an
extremely clean ore, very good, very quick recoveries of gold and copper, and
indications that agitation leaching will return even more of the gold."
<p>
Drilling at Cerro Casale will continue to focus on the southern extension and
on infilling the main sulphide zone.
<p>
In the meantime, the partners have released results from a further 11
reverse-circulation holes drilled on the Cerro Roman prospect, 7 km northeast
of Cerro Casale.
<p>
The mineralization occurs at the contact between a central,
east-west-trending, barren diorite plug and a fine-grained diorite.
<p>
Thirty-five holes have now tested the Cerro Roman gold porphyry, extending
the mineralization under a layer of volcanic cover 400 metres east towards
the Romancito target. Holes past this point have intersected the
unmineralized diorite under a thickening volcanic cover. The cover is
expected to thin again towards Romancito, which outcrops 1.4 km east of Cerro
Roman.
<p>
In the latest results, holes 23 and 24 were collared directly on the
outcropping zone. Hole 23 pulled 42 metres of 0.39 gram before intersecting
26 metres of 0.92 gram, while hole 24 hit 156 metres of 0.94 gram and 42
metres of 0.51 gram.
<p>
Stepout drilling intersected the following: 144 metres from surface grading
0.51 gram gold and 34 metres of 0.89 gram in hole 32; 84 metres of 0.91 gram
under 32 metres of volcanic cover in hole 33; 78 metres of 0.98 gram under 38
metres of cover in hole 25; 204 metres of 0.63 gram under 38 metres of cover
in hole 31; 136 metres of 0.7 gram under 64 metres of cover in hole 22; 18
metres of 1.47 grams under 94 metres of cover in hole 26; 118 metres of 1.07
grams under 64 metres of cover in hole 28; and 30 metres of 1.05 grams under
76 metres of cover in hole 29.
<p>
Preliminary metallurgical tests on oxide and sulphide material from Cerro
Roman indicate that both types would be amenable to cyanide heap-leach
recovery methods, with an average gold recovery of 79%.
<p>
Two holes also tested the newly discovered Jotabeche porphyry, situated 2 km
northeast of Cerro Roman and 1.5 km north of Romancito. The first hole
encountered 28 metres from surface grading 0.48 gram, 40 metres at a depth of
78-118 metres grading 0.34 gram, and 56 metres at 118-174 metres grading 1.23
grams.
<p>
The second hole pulled 12 metres from a depth of 34-46 metres grading 0.42
gram, 16 metres of 1.28 grams at 46-62 metres, and 48 metres at 138-186
metres grading 0.58 gram.
<p>
Arizona Star and Bema believe the three outcropping porphyries may be part of
the same large mineralized system. Drilling is set to resume at Jotabeche.
