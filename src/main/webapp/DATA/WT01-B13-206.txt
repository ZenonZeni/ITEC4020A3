<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_growthchart.gif" ALT="Amazing Growth in the Number of Mutual Funds: 1985-1995" ALIGN=RIGHT>
How fast is the mutual fund industry growing? Today, 31% of all American households own shares of at least one mutual fund. Between 1990 and year-end 1995, assets in mutual funds skyrocketed from $567 billion to $2.1 trillion. And, as the chart at right indicates, the number of mutual funds available has also soared, from 1,500 in 1985 to more than 5,700 today. Clearly, American investors are aware of the advantages of mutual funds. Now, we'd like to take that awareness one step further.
<P>
The following are 13 of the most common and costly mistakes to avoid when investing in mutual funds. After all, one of the surest routes to <I>smart</I>&#160; investing is <I>educated</I>&#160; investing.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>


<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #1</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund with short-term objectives to address long-term financial goals.</B></FONT>
<P>
If you are investing for your preschooler's college education or a dream retirement home, then a long-term investment perspective is probably more appropriate than a short-term one. Generally speaking, the more long-term your perspective, the greater your tolerance of price fluctuations should be. After all, if you are giving an investment 20 or 25 years to grow, you can probably withstand the price fluctuations that have historically accompanied greater rewards.
<P>
In short, don't overlook the dual use of many mutual fund investments -- meeting monthly income needs while also taking advantage of long-term growth potential.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #2</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Always choosing the fund that is advertising the highest yield, rather than looking at total return.</B></FONT>
<P>
Yield is one way of evaluating a fund's performance. A high yield, however, may come at the expense of the fund's net asset value, or share price. Some funds may reduce the underlying value to pay out that high current income. As a result, the market value of your investment may be diminished.
<P>
The most complete measure of mutual fund performance is <I><A HREF="../totalreturn.html">total return</A></I>.&#160; Total return takes into account the three components of performance: income dividends, capital gain dividends and changes in the value of your fund's shares. As a result, total return provides a more complete picture of performance than looking only at current income, or yield.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #3</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund based on incomplete magazine or newspaper information.</B></FONT>
<P>
Some magazine and newspaper rankings are based on yield (current income) rather than on the total value of the investment. Also, look carefully at the reporting period for a fund's performance. Some funds have had high returns for a quarter or two, or maybe one year. If you are making a long-term investment, it's critical that you look at the performance of a fund over a longer period of time -- three, five, or even ten years. Of course, a fund's past performance cannot guarantee its future performance, but it can give you a good idea of a fund's history and whether it has performed consistently over the years.
<P>
Two of the best-known third-party ranking services are <A HREF="http://www.lipperweb.com/">Lipper Analytical Services, Inc.</A> and <A HREF="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/library/msmf.pl">Morningstar, Inc.</A> Both rank funds by total return over long periods of time.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #4</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Investing in mutual funds that deduct sales charges from your reinvested dividends.</B></FONT>
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_chart4.gif" ALT="Missing Out on Additional Income Earned from Free Reinvestment of Dividends" ALIGN=RIGHT>
A sales charge compensates the individual who helps you select the right mutual fund. But, after you buy, why should you continue paying? Make sure the fund you select doesn't continue to deduct sales charges on your reinvested dividends. Over the life of your investment, free dividend reinvestment, with full compounding, can be a significant benefit. Kemper Funds offer free reinvestment of dividends at net asset value. That means you do not pay a sales charge for dividend reinvestment.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Note: The assumed 8% return in the chart is not indicative of past or future performance of any particular mutual fund. The yield and net asset value of a mutual fund will fluctuate. In the example, total income earned from free reinvestment of dividends compounded monthly over a 10-year period is $22,196.40. Total income earned from reinvestment of dividends with a 4% sales charge over a 10-year period is $21,501.83. So, the additional income earned from free reinvestment of dividends over a 10-year period is $694.57.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #5</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Not investing in a municipal bond mutual fund when your objective is tax-free income.</B></FONT>
<P>
Given today's potentially higher marginal tax rates, more investors are turning to tax-free investments such as mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds. The income dividends from these funds are exempt from federal income taxes, though they may be subject to state or local taxes. And, if you invest in a state-specific fund, the income can be free from state and local taxes as well. For some investors, a portion of income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #6</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Not having an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) if you are eligible to have one.</B></FONT>
<P>
Despite legislative changes over the years, the IRA continues to offer most investors tremendous opportunities to save and invest for retirement through the deferral of taxes. The powerful effect of tax-deferred compounding over time, and the affordability of the IRA, continue to make this an extremely important component of effective retirement planning.
<P>
Investing in more than one mutual fund IRA allows you to further reduce risk by diversifying. You should, of course, review the description of the investment objective and policies in the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> of a fund before investing to more fully understand the market and credit risk associated with an investment in a particular fund.<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #7</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund without understanding all of the fees and expenses.</B></FONT>
<P>
Some investors shop by comparing only sales charges. But, in addition to sales charges, mutual fund shareowners indirectly pay for management fees, general expenses, and, in some cases, distribution and administrative fees.
<P>
Distribution and administrative fees are used by some funds toward payment of fund marketing and account-servicing. These fees are normally paid to third parties, like brokerage firms and banks, which market and service fund accounts. These charges are either in lieu of, or in addition to, sales charges paid by the investor. Management fees are paid by the fund to the fund's investment manager for expertise in the management of the fund's portfolio. These fees are usually a fixed percent per annum of the funds average net assets.
<P>
General expenses include other operational expenses that are charged directly to the fund and include transfer agent, custodial and legal fees. Before you invest, study all the fees. It's better to know up-front than to find out later that performance of your fund is being pulled down by high distribution and management fees, or uncontrolled fund expenses. And, be sure to read a fund's <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> before you invest.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #8</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that doesn't have the shareholder privileges you might need or failing to activate those privileges when you open a fund account.</B></FONT>
<P>
To make the management of your account easier, most mutual funds offer investing privileges free of charge. Some funds, however, charge a fee for using them.
<P>
To avoid headaches and delays later on, be sure to activate your investing privileges -- especially exchange and wire-redemption privileges -- when you open a new account. These privileges include: <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">reinvestment of dividends</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">exchange privileges</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">wire redemptions</A>, <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">pre-authorized purchase plans</A> and <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">systematic withdrawal plans</A>.
<P>
Whatever you decide, make sure that you choose a fund that offers the privileges you need - at no extra charge. These privileges are subject to modification, suspension, or termination by a fund. 

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #9</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Failing to reinvest all dividends in order to take advantage of the power of compounding.</B></FONT>
<P>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/mistakes_chart9.gif" ALT="Failing to Reinvest Dividends and Missing Out on the Power of Compounding" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Reinvesting your dividends can help add substantially to the growth of your investment. The chart to the right (for illustrative purposes only) portrays the beneficial impact of reinvestment income monthly at various interest rates, over a ten-year period. The chart assumes a $10,000 initial investment. The assumed rates are not representative of any yield or return that a particular fund may offer.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #10</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Failing to get professional advice in selecting the mutual funds that are right for your unique financial situation.</B></FONT>
<P>
Today's marketplace offers more than 5,700 mutual funds with many different investment objectives. In each investment category alone, there can be hundreds of funds from which to choose. How do you decide which fund is best for your personal financial situation and goals?
<P>
The answer is simple: obtain the advice of a broker, banker or financial planner before you purchase. In today's ever-changing financial and tax environment, the need for professional guidance has never been greater. It's easy to consult a broker, banker or financial planner before you make a mutual fund choice.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #11</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that makes redeeming shares like pulling teeth.</B></FONT>
<P>
Make sure the fund you select has simple and convenient redemption procedures. At most fund companies, the quickest and most convenient way is to have redemption proceeds wired to your local bank account. Kemper's wire-redemption privilege, if pre-authorized, makes it possible for you to redeem $1,000 or more with one toll-free phone call. Your money is normally sent via FedWire&#174; to your designated bank account the next business day, free of charge by the fund.
<P>
Even if you did not choose wire-redemption privileges, you may still redeem up to $50,000* without obtaining a signature guarantee. To redeem $50,000 or less, just call your financial representative. Or, you can send a letter requesting the amount you desire, signed by the owner(s) of the account. A check payable to you will be sent to your address of record within seven days. There is no need to make an extra trip to your bank or broker to get your signature guaranteed.
<P>
*Redemption requests by individuals and certain designated institutional account holders for over $50,000, and all requests by institutions not so designated, do require a signature guarantee. See the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for details and limitations.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #12</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that is not a member of a family of mutual funds.</B></FONT>
<P>
Financial markets are constantly changing in response to economic and environmental factors. As a result, the mutual fund you select today may not be right tomorrow. You need the advantage of being able to conveniently exchange into another fund with different investment objectives. So you should select a fund that is part of a family of funds.
<P>
Kemper Funds include a wide range of mutual funds to address a lifetime of changing investment objectives. Should your investment needs or market conditions change, you can move your investment within the Fund Family with one toll-free call.* Your Shareholder Services representative will be happy to tell you more about the other Kemper Funds.
<P>
*The exchange privilege is subject to modification, suspension and termination and to certain limitations described in the <A HREF="../../prospectus.html">prospectus</A>.

<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="003300">Common Mistake #13</FONT></B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Choosing a fund that is administered and managed by a firm that is here today, but may be gone tomorrow.</B></FONT>
<P>
When you invest your money in a mutual fund, you want to be sure it is being handled by an experienced, well capitalized firm with an established track record.
