<HR NOSHADE>

Richard Rozmahel passes the time by reading the bulletin board hanging

above the wheezing printer attached to the DNA sequencer. There's an

ad from a company selling genetic research chemicals. They're offering

a free t-shirt sporting the words: "Ultra Pure Human Being". At the

bottom he reads, "Send 6 peel-off seals from any GIBCO BRL Enzymes and

receive an 'I make my living manipulating DNA' briefcase free."

<P>

"Aint it the truth," thinks Richard to himself as he pulls yet another

variation of the same tedious experiment from the printer. He looks at

the printout absently as he makes his way back to his desk in the

corner of the crowded genetics lab. People and equipment take up every

possible space. Shelves groan with bottles, dishes and jars. He passes

a friend staring into a microscope. A big humming refrigerator juts

out into the passageway. Another student wears gloves while she

puts hundreds of precisely measured portions of various liquids into

tiny test tubes.

<P>

Richard stops suddenly just before he gets to his desk. Something is

wrong with these traces. There it is: a three-base pair deletion--a

type of genetic mutation in a DNA sequence. The genetic information

required to describe one amino acid in a protein chain is missing, as

if one bead had fallen from a precious necklace. Instead of sitting

down, Richard rushes to show his supervisor Dr. Tsui (pronounced

"Choy"). It's almost 6:00pm, most people have left for the night, but

Tsui is still working.

<P>

Tsui's office is small. When Richard arrives, Tsui is hunched over the

desk poring over some other experimental results. The shelves are

loaded with books. Piles of paper cover every horizontal surface.

Richard looks at the shabby green rug while he waits.

<P>

"What is it Richard?", says Tsui with a happy Hong Kong accent.

<P>

"I'm pretty sure I've found a 3-base pair deletion. Look here." He

indicates the two traces; one from a normal person's genes and one

from a person with cystic fibrosis--a fatal disease that kills about

one out of every 2000 Canadians, mostly children. Cystic fibrosis is

the most common genetic disease among white people. Kids who have

cystic fibrosis are born with it. Half of them will die before they

are 25 and few make it past 30. It affects all the parts of the body

that secrete mucous; places like your lungs, your stomach, your nose

and mouth. The mucous of kids with cystic fibrosis is so thick

sometimes they cannot breath.  

<P>

Tsui looks at the printout and says, "This is very good Richard. Now

show me that it's real." Tsui doesn't seem excited at all but he knows

this is a solid clue, a major hint that they have found what they are

looking for: the gene for cystic fibrosis, the cause of that terrible

disease. But he has had false hopes before, so he is not going to

celebrate until they check this out carefully. Maybe the difference

between the two gene sequences is just the normal variation between

individuals. If you take any two normal people and compare 1000 DNA

bases, you have a good chance of finding the same thing Richard just

found. There are plenty of little variations between individuals.

<P>

But Tsui remembers that day, May 9, 1989, as the day they discovered

the gene for cystic fibrosis.

<P>

He and his team spent the next 5 months making it real. "The process

of scientific discovery is not a simple thing. It takes months of

repetitive tests to prove something without a doubt," says Tsui. They

identified a "signature" pattern of DNA on either side of the

base-pair deletion, and using that as a marker they compared 100

normal people's genes with the identical DNA sequence from 100 cystic

fibrosis patients. By September 1989 they were sure they had the

cystic fibrosis gene.

<P>

Then they had to figure out exactly what that gene did. After several

more years Tsui and his team discovered that the DNA sequence with the

mutation was part of the instructions for making a special protein called

CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator), a part of

the cell membrane in certain special epithelial (surface) cells that

generate mucous. This protein regulates a channel through the cell

wall for chloride ions. Proteins are made of long chains of amino

acids. The CFTR protein has 1480 amino acids. Kids with cystic fibrosis are

missing one single amino acid in their CFTR. Because of this their

mucous ends up being too thick and all sorts of things become

difficult for them. Thanks to Tsui's research, scientists now have a

much better idea of how the disease works. We can now easily predict

when a couple will produce a child with cystic fibrosis. With

increasing understanding, scientists may also be able to devise

improved treatments for children born with the disease.

<P>

Why do 1 in 25 caucasians carry the mutation for CF? Tsui thinks that

people who carry it may also have linked beneficial mutations that

might, for instance, give them more resistance to diahrea-like

diseases.



<P>

<B>History</B><BR>



Lap Chee Tsui grew up in a little village on the Kowloon side of Hong

Kong called Dai Goon Yu. It was near the Kai Tak airport. He

would hang out with a group of kids, mostly boys, and they would go

exploring in ponds, catching tadpoles and fish to do simple

experiments. One favourite project was to go to the market and buy

silkworms. They would bring home the silkworms and pick leaves off the

mulberry bushes to feed them. Tsui remembers one day he and his

friends picked almost all the leaves off a mulberry bush in a

neighbour's yard. The furious fellow came out and chased the kids

away. 

<P> 

As a boy Tsui dreamed of being an architect. (He still draws all his

own diagrams and slides). Tsui did not take up genetics until after

his PhD. He was more interested in studying the nature of diseases.

<P>

Molecular geneticists try to understand the structure and function

of genes. Lap Chee Tsui is particularly interested in the gene

for cystic fibrosis and other genes on human chromosome number 7.





<P>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/tsui_science.gif>



<H3>1. Human chromosome 7</H3>

The cystic fibrosis gene sits on the long arm of chromosome 7. One out

of every 25 people in the caucasian population carry the genetic

mutation for CF in this gene. Chromosome 7 has 150,000,000 base pairs

or units of DNA.

<H3>2. The cystic fibrosis gene</H3>

Using microbiological techniques, Tsui first localised the CF gene

product to a region of the chromosome. The region has 230,000 DNA base

pairs which spell out a series 1480 amino acids that curl up to make

the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator protein. The

little triangle shows the location of the 3-base-pair deletion

mutation that Tsui discovered.

<H3>3. Model of CFTR protein in cell membrane</H3>

A normal gene makes this protein that regulates the passage of

chloride ions and hense the secretion of mucous in epithelial

(surface) cells lining the gut, lungs, etc. One missing protein at

this spot causes CF. There are also 450 other kinds of mutations

associated with CF.

You'll Need:<P>

<UL>

<LI> Your mom's blood type (A, B, AB, or O)

<LI> Your dad's blood type (A, B, AB, or O)



</UL>

What to do:<P>



<DL>

<DT>

<DD>     Knowing that you get one chromosome from your mom and one

from your dad, can you figure out what your possible blood type is?

You need to know that people with blood type A can have either two A

chromosomes (AA), or one A and one O chromosome (AO). Similarly people

with type B blood have chromosomes in the form of BB or BO. Type AB

people have one A and one B chromosome (AB) and type O people must

have two O chromosomes (OO). So if a type AA person is the mother and

the father is type BO, there are two chances for an AB child and two

chances for an AO child. Try to figure out what blood type you (and

any of your brothers or sisters) might have.

<HR NOSHADE>

The genes of a monkey and a human are almost identical, varying by

only about 2%. How can such a small difference result in such

different animals? Why do humans develop into humans and monkeys into

monkeys? It has to do with the regulation of gene expression which is

very poorly understood. Tsui likens the situation to two orchestras,

each having exactly the same instruments, and the same music to play.

Yet the two orchestras can sound entirely different, especially if

they have different conductors.
