<H1>Reducing methane emissions<BR>
from livestock farming</H1>
<HR>
<B>Methane is the most important <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gas</A> resulting from human 
activities except for carbon dioxide.</B>  Scientists have discovered that the amount of 
methane in the atmosphere began to rise two or three centuries ago.  They now believe 
that current methane emissions will account for over 15% of man-induced climate change 
over a 100-year time frame (because methane has a relatively short life-time in the 
atmosphere, the impact of current emissions will be less over longer time frames).  In 
descending order of importance, the human activities that result in methane emissions are 
<A HREF = "fs032.html">livestock farming</A>, production of 
fossil fuels, <A HREF = "fs034.html">wet rice cultivation</A>, 
biomass burning, landfills, and domestic sewage.1<P>
<B>Domestically raised cattle, deer, buffalo, sheep, and goats contribute 15-20% of 
the methane emissions caused by human activities. </B> Much of the food eaten by 
these hoofed animals cannot be digested until it has been fermented.  This process takes 
place in the part of the digestive system called the rumen.  Amongst the various 
micro-organisms found in the rumen are bacteria that produce methane as a by-product of 
the fermentation process. Under certain conditions, <A HREF = 
"fs033.html">additional methane is also released from the 
animals’ wastes.</A><P>
<B>Cows account for around 70% of the methane from domestic animals. </B> 
Researchers with <A HREF = "fs208.html">the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</A> base their forecasts of methane 
emissions on estimates that worldwide meat and dairy production will increase by more 
than 45% by the year 2025.  With demand for red meat and dairy products static or falling 
in the industrialized world, most of this increase it is expected to occur in the developing 
countries as incomes and populations grow.<P>
<B>New technologies can both raise the productivity of cattle and lower their 
methane output.</B>  Most cattle are raised on poor quality fodder and on land that 
cannot support other types of farming.  The resulting deficiencies in various nutrients 
encourage the production of methane.  Studies have shown that supplementing a cow’s 
diet with substances such as urea (a source of ammonia) increases the animal’s ability to 
digest food.  This has two beneficial effects.  First, by reducing the amount of fermentation 
taking place during digestion it can cut methane emissions per unit of forage by 25-75%.  
Second, by raising the productivity of each animal it allows dairy cows to produce more 
milk and beef cattle to fatten faster.  This means that the same amount of market demand 
can be satisfied by smaller herds.  In some countries, especially in Latin America, this 
might confer the additional benefit of reducing the clearing of forests to create land for 
cattle ranching (deforestation increases atmospheric concentrations of carbon 
dioxide).<P>
<B>Pilot projects in India have had impressive results . . .   </B>Adding various 
supplements to cattle feed has reduced methane emissions per unit of digested food by 
30-50%.  Furthermore, thanks to improved feeding practices, draft cows used as beasts of 
burden became stronger and breeding cows were able to produce more calves (the interval 
between births was reduced by almost half, from 24 months to 12-15 months).  As a 
result, fewer breeding cows were needed to maintain the same herd size and a smaller 
number of draft animals could do the same amount of work.  India’s National Dairy 
Development Board estimates that the total number of cattle in the country could be 
reduced from 300 million to 120 million with no adverse effect upon production.  In 
addition to reducing methane emissions, this would also increase economic efficiency.<P>
<B>... but persuading farmers to adopt the new technology may sometimes be 
difficult.</B>  Disseminating information on new techniques is particularly difficult in the 
agricultural sector because of the large number of farmers who must be reached and the 
relatively poor communications in rural areas.  Farmers also tend to be highly risk averse.  
What’s more, the new foodstuffs will cost an Indian farmer almost twice as much as the 
old ones and, although they raise productivity, the initial upfront investment can be a 
strong deterrent.  Finally, while the ammonia contained in the new products improves 
digestion, it can also be dangerous to livestock if wrongly administered.<P>
<B>In some countries efforts to reduce the number of cows could conflict with 
certain social needs.  </B>Because richer farmers can more easily afford the cash outlays 
required for the improved new feeds, they are more likely than poorer farmers to benefit.  
This could lead to the loss of land and livelihood amongst subsistence farmers.  In many 
countries fewer cows might also conflict with the goal of families to own at least one cow 
as a secure source of essential nutrients in an often vegetarian diet, as a source of fuel 
(cattle dung is an increasingly important fuel as timber has become more scarce), and for 
the status that ownership imparts.  Furthermore, cows have religious value in some 
cultures and frequently form an important part of a dowry or bride-price.<P>
