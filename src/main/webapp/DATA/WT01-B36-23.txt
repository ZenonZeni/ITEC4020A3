<h2>9. The New Theology</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A coffee shop in Indiana did not seem a very likely
place in which to encounter the Anglican bishop of Woolwich,
England, probably the best-known advocate of the radical New
Theology. But that in fact is where I met him one dreary morning
in 1966, on the Crawfordsville campus of Wabash College. Bishop
John A. T. Robinson had come to Wabash from England to
participate in the annual Lilly Lecture Series, and he looked a
bit weary as he sat there in a corner booth discussing Dr. Thomas
J. J. Altizer's announcement of God's demise. He shook his head
over the idea, wondering aloud how Altizer could justify his
curious position on Judaism. Later we left the shop together,
heading for Robinson's temporary digs at the Caleb Mills House,
and the balding, pink-cheeked bishop seemed a lonely figure as he
walked across the campus through a misty rainfall, his macintosh
flapping in the wind. Some three years before, with the
publication of a little book titled <i>Honest to God</i>, he had
been attacked as a heretic, a traitor to the faith and a false
prophet; now&#151;bitter pill&#151;there were some who regarded
him as a theological square: in fact a real cube. For the moment
at least, the Ground of Being was Out. The Death of God was In. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Honest to God</i> had created a sensation when
it first appeared in 1963. To the astonishment of the author and
his publishers, no doubt, the book became an international best
seller, and total sales had exceeded a million when I met the
bishop. There are as many New Theologies as there are New
Theologians, but Robinson's book has had a tremendous impact both
in Europe and America, and it offers an excellent vantage point
from which to explore the main trends in radical theology just
prior to the emergence of the Death of God school. It is in a
sense a compendium of the ideas that shaped those trends, and
what it did basically was bring together a number of concepts
developed by four contemporary giants of philosophy and theology:
Rudolf Bultmann, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Paul Tillich, and Martin
Buber. But it brought them together in a new synthesis, the most
important aspect of which was a new interpretation of divine
transcendence, and it popularized them for a vast lay readership.
In doing so, it gave expression to the spiritual unrest and
dissatisfaction of laymen who had been theologically
inarticulate, and it helped also to lay a popular groundwork for
the still more radical ideas which were soon to follow in
America. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Rudolf Bultmann</i>, to begin with, the
bishop took the concept of &quot;demythologizing&quot; the Bible.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To demythologize does not mean to debunk. On the
contrary. A myth may represent an eternal truth&#151;intuitively
grasped perhaps&#151;but the mode of expression will be dictated
always by the world-view of the men who lived in the age when the
myth was promulgated, and it will reflect also that age's level
of knowledge and sophistication. Its language is metaphorical and
anthropomorphic. The method of demythologizing probes for the
deeper meaning hidden by the metaphor. &quot;Its aim,&quot; said
Bultmann, &quot;is not to eliminate the mythological statements
but to interpret them.&quot; In essence this is the same test we
applied in an earlier chapter to Wordsworth's ode and to poetic
symbolism in general: does the <i>&quot;is&quot;</i> really mean <i>&quot;is,&quot;</i>
or does it perhaps mean <i>&quot;as if&quot;?</i> Suppose, then,
said Bultmann, that the authors of the Bible wanted to convey the
idea of God's transcendence. They could do so only by resorting
to the crude category of space&#151;resulting in a God who is
&quot;up there&quot; in a place called heaven. According to
Robinson, a more sophisticated age refined the veridical myth to
connote a God who was not &quot;up there&quot; but &quot;out
there,&quot; somewhere beyond the flashing comets. But again this
is a crude metaphor, and it no longer satisfies modern man, who
is intruding upon outer space with radio telescopes and rocket
probes. To remain relevant, the truth of God's transcendence must
be demythologized or demetaphorized. It and other biblical truths
must be retranslated in modern terms for men who are able to
digest deeper levels of abstraction. But how? If God is not
&quot;up there&quot; or &quot;out there,&quot; where is he? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Dietrick Bonhoeffer</i>, the bishop took
the concept of a Christianity &quot;without religion.&quot; This
is certainly an enigmatic idea, and Bonhoeffer never had an
opportunity to elaborate upon it; it was merely suggested in
letters and notes which he wrote in a Nazi prison before he was
hanged in April 1945. But it has haunted many churchmen with a
moth-to-flame fascination, and it would be difficult to
exaggerate the fundamental influence it has had upon contemporary
theology. For most New Theologians it has served as a sort of
Rorschach ink blot, and each has brought to it his own
interpretation. For Robinson it represented at one level a
rejection of churchiness and otherworldliness. God is neither
&quot;up there&quot; nor &quot;out there.&quot; He is rather, in
Bonhoeffer's words, &quot;the 'beyond' in the midst of our
life.&quot; And that is where we should seek him, in our midst. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, said Robinson, religion has implied
withdrawal from the world to a special compartment of life where,
in a sort of spiritual vacuum, one prays and thinks holy
thoughts. Too often, in Ronald Gregor Smith's phrase, it has
implied &quot;a kind of battle against the world on behalf of
God.&quot; One seeks God only in the sanctuary, in the gaps of
life. Inevitably, this attitude has made worship possible, or
profitable, for only a comparatively small cadre of religiously
minded people&#151;for the praying type. And something else. If
God is used simply as a <i>deus ex machina</i> to explain man's
unanswered questions about life and the universe, what happens
when these questions, one after one, are answered? God is pushed
further and further back by the tidal advance of knowledge, said
Bonhoeffer. Man has less and less need of him. &quot;As in the
scientific field,&quot; said Bonhoeffer, &quot;so in human
affairs generally, what we call 'God' is being more and more
edged out of life, losing more and more ground. Catholic and
Protestant historians are agreed that it is in this development
that the great defection from God, from Christ, is to be
discerned.&quot; Indeed, Robinson agreed, Julian Huxley expressed
the same idea or was thinking in the same vein when he observed
that, operationally, God &quot;is beginning to resemble not a
ruler but the last fading smile of a cosmic Cheshire Cat.&quot;
The world has come of age, said Bonhoeffer, and men in a world
come of age should accept their adulthood; they should go about
their business just <i>as if</i> God did not exist, not clinging
to his hand every time there is a street to cross. &quot;God
allows himself to be edged out of the world, and that is exactly
the way, the only way, in which he can be with us and help
us.&quot; Like a parent who wants his child to be self-reliant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But how does one worship in a post-religious world?
By accepting the world, said Robinson. By seeking the sacred in
the secular, the holy in the common, the beyond in our midst. One
should seek God &quot;in the hungry, the naked, the homeless and
the prisoner.&quot; Prayer should not be a withdrawal from the
world to God but a penetration through the world to God; for
nothing, after all, is really secular: the whole world is holy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Paul Tillich</i>, the bishop took the
concept of defining God as the Ground of Being. Tillich rejected
the view that God is in any sense a Being. This rejection applies
of course to the God of Deism, who started the world ticking with
mechanistic precision and then went off somewhere far away and
remote, very much, as Robinson put it, &quot;like a rich aunt in
Australia.&quot; But Tillich also rejected the more familiar God
of Theism, in so far as that implies some kind of supernatural
Person&#151;a separate Being who exists in an intimate
relationship with the world which he transcends. Theism
necessarily does imply this kind of God, said Tillich. It implies
&quot;a being beside others&quot; who is simply a part of
reality&#151;the most important part, but still only a part; it
implies that God &quot;is a being, not being-itself.&quot;
Tillich proposed that theology replace this Being with the Ground
of Being, and that a new dimension be adopted to conceptualize
this reality. As a substitute for height (as in &quot;up
there&quot;) or distance (as in &quot;out there&quot;), Tillich
suggested that we think of God in terms of depth (as in &quot;in
our midst&quot;). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson took up the suggestion, defining God as
&quot;the ultimate depth of all our being, the creative ground
and meaning of all our existence.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bishop wrote that traditional Christian
theology has concerned itself with adducing proofs for the
existence of God, and the psychological implication, at least, is
that God might not exist. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, then, what happens if we speak of God simply
as ultimate reality or the Ground of our Being&#151;as opposed,
for example, to <i>a</i> Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then it is no longer necessary to debate the
existence of God, since nobody doubts there is an ultimate
reality. The whole problem is reduced to speculation about the <i>nature</i>
of this ultimate reality, or God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lot of people didn't like that. It seemed much
too easy, for one thing. And perhaps there is a basic flaw in the
argument, as we shall see later. In any case, the bishop also
used the Ground of Being as a wedge for the most awesome effort
of all &#151;demythologizing God himself. Behind the various
mythological expressions, what is the ontology of God? What is
the nature of ultimate reality, and what in truth is the real
meaning of transcendence? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>From Martin Buber</i>, the bishop took the
concept of the I-Thou relationship. We have already referred to
this concept; let us examine it now in more detail. Buber was a
mystic, and he began his argument with the proposition that all
men are born with a sense of cosmic connection. The sense of
&quot;I&quot; or individual self is not present at birth, and in
fact the child at first does not distinguish between himself and
the shining world which his eyes have opened upon. In the womb he
had known a life &quot;of purely natural combination, bodily
interaction and flowing one to the other,&quot; and after birth
he still rests for a time &quot;in the womb of the great mother,
the undivided primal world that precedes form.&quot; Buber
recalled the saying of the Jews: &quot;In the mother's body man
knows the universe, in birth he forgets it.&quot; But he does not
forget it all at once, and he never forgets it completely. Before
his sense of natural connection with the world fades gradually
away, the child is given time to establish a sense of spiritual
connection&#151;which Buber referred to as relation. Gradually
there develops a sense of &quot;I&quot; or self&#151; &quot;the
separation of the body from the world round about
it&quot;&#151;but the world nevertheless is still perceived as
existing in relation to the self. It is perceived as Thou, and
this is the I-Thou relationship. But the sense of &quot;I&quot;
grows ever stronger, until at last it snaps the fragile bond of
relation between subject and object, I and Thou. Thou becomes It
(or He or She), and I-It is the primary word of separation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world perceived as It is something to be used
and exploited, and it is perceived in space and time&#151;whereas
the world as Thou is not perceived in space and time. The world
perceived as It is chopped into isolated segments, and the
segments are ranked in an artificial order; they are organized
for cause-and-effect analysis, so that man can &quot;get his
bearings.&quot; Man no longer looks at the world in relation:
&quot;instead of looking at it he observes it, instead of
accepting it as it is, he turns it to his own account.&quot; And
why? &quot;Only as It can it enter the structure of
knowledge.&quot; This is necessary for survival, because man
cannot live without It. &quot;But he who lives with It alone is
not a man,&quot; and the memory of Thou never dies altogether:
there are &quot;short, uncanny moments&quot; when it reappears,
&quot;lyric and dramatic episodes, seductive and magical.&quot;
The memory of that undivided primal world lingers as &quot;a
secret image of desire,&quot; and Buber implied that this is the
real meaning of the Freudian wish to retreat to the womb. Not at
all the sign of an unhealthy pathology, it represents a natural
longing to re-establish the cosmic connection. Man of course
cannot crawl back into the womb, in this life at least, but he
can relate to the world; he can look for the thing-in-itself,
seeing &quot;each thing simply as being.&quot; He can say
&quot;Thou&quot; to the world, and the world in turn will say
&quot;Thou&quot; back to him. In this relationship a man affirms
the reality of the world&#151;and he affirms also the reality of
himself. For the &quot;I&quot; is very real. With the emergence
of personal life, a man cannot deny his &quot;I,&quot; but he can
choose what sort of &quot;I&quot; it will be&#151;since the
&quot;I&quot; of I-Thou is not the same as the &quot;I&quot; of
I-It. A man can choose to be a <i>person</i> or an <i>individual</i>,
and all men are either persons or individuals: the &quot;I&quot;
of I-Thou is a person, and the &quot;I&quot; of I-It is an
individual. In I-Thou a man does not and cannot surrender his
personality, since the essence of I-Thou is personal relation: an
&quot;I&quot; relating to the Thou. A person does not lose
&quot;his special being, his being different.&quot; But he does
not revel in his special being as the individual does; he simply
accepts it as a necessary part of being in general. He seeks for
the Thou, which he sees in the eyes of every man and every
creature. He lives in the here and now, fully aware that
&quot;the one thing that matters is visible, full acceptance of
the present.&quot; He recognizes that true love is the
&quot;responsibility of an I for a Thou,&quot; and this leads him
at last &quot;to the dreadful point&#151;to love all men.&quot;
He hallows this life, and thus he meets the living God who is
present in every relational event. In every finite Thou he
catches a glimpse of the eternal Thou. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I-Thou was the final ingredient in Robinson's
eclectic omelet; he was ready now to face the question of
God&#151;and the question of God, he acknowledged, was the
question of transcendence. It was certainly the question as far
as the Western God was concerned&#151;no doubt about
that&#151;and the bishop therefore did his best to salvage the
concept. That really was the whole point of his book, although
many of his critics received just the opposite impression. The
task, he said, was &quot;to validate the idea of transcendence
for modern man.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson began with an all-out attack on Theistic
transcendence, agreeing with Tillich that the atheists were quite
correct in rejecting a transcendent Being or supreme Person. The
bishop conceded the fact that classical Christian theology does
not in fact picture God as a Person, and &quot;the Church's best
theologians have not laid themselves open to such attack.&quot;
Nevertheless, he said, &quot;popular Christianity has always
posited such a supreme personality,&quot; and the question really
was whether or not popular theology could afford to sacrifice the
concept. To do so, R. W. Hepburn had written, &quot;seems at once
to take one quite outside Christianity.&quot; Robinson felt,
however, that the concept could be abandoned&#151;indeed it must
be, since the average layman was finding it harder and harder to
take seriously. People must be told, then, that there is no
reason they should take it seriously. &quot;If Christianity is to
survive . . . there is no time to lose in detaching it from this
scheme of thought.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to what does one attach it? To what does
transcendence refer, if not to a transcendent Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson groped for an answer. And he found one, he
thought, in man's divine attributes&#151;love, wisdom, justice.
Feuerbach was looking over his shoulder now, and the bishop knew
he was treading &quot;on very dangerous ground.&quot; One slip
and he could easily plunge into the bottomless chasm of humanism
or pantheism, making of man's nature the <i>ens rea lissimum</i>.
The problem perhaps was to identify God as the source of our
higher aspirations, without at the same time making us synonymous
with the source&#151;that is to say, without making man and God
identical. In any case, the bishop pushed on with the idea of
defining God as the Ground of our Being or as ultimate reality.
If God is ultimate reality, what, then, is this ultimate reality?
Tillich had proposed that we think of it in terms of depth, you
will remember, and Robinson quoted Tillich's seminal passage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The name of this infinite and inexhaustible depth and
    ground of all being is <i>God</i>. That depth is what the
    word <i>God</i> means. And if that word has not much meaning
    for you, translate it, and speak of the depths of your life,
    of the source of your being, of your ultimate concern, of
    what you take seriously without any reservation. Perhaps, in
    order to do so, you must forget everything traditional that
    you have learned about God, perhaps even that word itself.
    For if you know that God means depth, you know much about
    him. You cannot then call yourself an atheist or unbeliever.
    For you cannot think or say: Life has no depth! Life is
    shallow. [Furthermore] . . . speak of the depth of history,
    of the ground and aim of our social life, and of what you
    take seriously without reservation in your moral and
    political activities. Perhaps you should call this depth <i>hope</i>,
    simply hope. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One is reminded also of Tillich's &quot;courage to
be&quot; as an argument for faith. Why this courage? Where does
it come from? In the same sense, why do men hope&#151;and where
does their hope originate if not in the very depths of their
Being? In the last analysis, depth meant for Tillich &quot;those
deep things for which religion stands: the feeling for the
inexhaustible mystery of life, the grip of an ultimate meaning of
existence.&quot; And this mystery&#151;this ultimate
meaning&#151;is the source of the biblical intuition that there
is <i>something</i> which transcends our everyday life and the
world of appearances. There is, to use a cliché, more here than
meets the eye. And this &quot;more&quot; is the
transcendent&#151;the not seen. It is that which we normally do
not perceive or recognize, but which nevertheless makes such
urgent demands upon us. It is the truth about ourselves and the
truth about Being itself. &quot;To call God transcendent in this
sense,&quot; said Tillich, &quot;does not mean that one must
establish a 'superworld' of divine objects. It does mean that,
within itself, the finite world points beyond itself. In other
words, it is self-transcendent.&quot; As Robinson expressed it:
&quot;The necessity for the name 'God' lies in the fact that our
being has depths which naturalism, whether evolutionary,
mechanistic, dialectical or humanistic, cannot or will not
recognize.&quot; And in Tillich's words again: &quot;We are
always held and comprehended by something that is greater than we
are, that has a claim upon us, and that demands response from
us.&quot; This is the Ground of our Being, and we can no more
escape it than Francis Thompson could escape the Hound of Heaven.
A trumpet sounds from the hid battlements of Eternity, and a
Voice declares: &quot;All things betray thee, who betrayest Me .
. . Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me . . . Lo!
naught contents thee, who content'st not Me.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>To thine own Self be true</i>. Is that what this
means? Is that what God means? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Wabash I had a long talk with Robinson in the
library of the Caleb Mills House, and I asked him, among other
things, &quot;However that word God is finally translated, do you
believe that it transcends our Being?&quot; He replied,
&quot;Yes. I believe, obviously, that God represents a reality
which in a real sense encounters us as it were from without. It
is not something that we think up for ourselves. In many ways I
would find it much easier to invent a very different kind of God,
far less uncomfortable to live with. There is this, I think,
overmastering reality which challenges us, judges us, confronts
us, questions our whole being. It is this element of
otherness&#151;of unconditional grace and demand&#151;which it
seems to me traditional Christianity has meant by transcendence.
This is a dimension of experience in life which I've no desire
whatever to deny. What I am concerned with is to try and find
some way of expressing this dimension which doesn't put God right
at the edge of our whole experience and world.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An unconditional demand would seem to imply a
built-in demand which is forced upon us by the very nature of our
Being. It would seem to imply that we are not completely free to
choose our own destiny and to make of ourselves whatever we
please. Or, to put it another way&#151;and the distinction is
important&#151;we <i>are</i> free to choose, but our freedom is
less than perfect: if we deny the unconditional demand, we will
suffer for it. We will suffer the anguish of alienation from the
Ground of our Being. To boil it down, Sartre was wrong. There is
an essence (unconditional) which precedes our existence and which
gives our existence its meaning and direction; it tells us what
we should do and where we should go. Whether we heed it or not is
up to us. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what is this essence? What is the Ground of our
Being? What is ultimate reality? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In three words, what is God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In his book, Robinson used three words to answer
those questions. And he took the three words from another book.
To understand his meaning, we must return for a moment to Buber,
to whom the bishop owes a large debt, and we must ask what Buber
meant by the eternal Thou, as opposed simply to Thou. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Buber had no objection to the word God.
Anticipating what was to come, perhaps, he wrote in <i>I and Thou</i>,
first published in 1923: &quot;Many men wish to reject the word
God as a legitimate usage, because it is so misused. It is indeed
the most heavily laden of all the words used by men. For that
very reason it is the most imperishable and most
indispensable.&quot; Buber had no sympathy with the Eastern
concept of absorption in the Absolute, in &quot;the One thinking
Essence.&quot; He spoke of relation, not absorption. He opposed
the doctrine that &quot;universal being and self-being are the
same.&quot; He told of a Face that is sometimes seen, briefly,
when one looks deep into the eyes of a finite Thou. This is God,
the eternal Thou. And this is transcendent. &quot;Every sphere is
compassed in the eternal Thou, but it is not compassed in
them.&quot; &quot;God comprises, but is not, the universe. So
too, God comprises, but is not, my Self.&quot; Nor did Buber
refrain from speaking of God as a Person; in a 1957 postscript to
his book, he wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The description of God as a Person is indispensable for
    everyone who like myself means by &quot;God&quot; not a
    principle (although mystics like Eckhart sometimes identify
    him with &quot;Being&quot;) and like myself means by
    &quot;God&quot; not an idea (although philosophers like Plato
    at times could hold that he was this): but who rather means
    by &quot;God,&quot; as I do, him who&#151;whatever else he
    may be&#151;enters into a direct relation with us men in
    creative, revealing and redeeming acts, and thus makes it
    possible for us to enter into a direct relation with him.
    This ground and meaning of our existence constitutes a
    mutuality, arising again and again, such as can subsist only
    between persons. The concept of personal being is indeed
    completely incapable of declaring what God's essential being
    is, but it is both permitted and necessary to say that God is
    <i>also</i> a Person.... From this attribute would stem my
    and all men's being as person . . . As a Person God gives
    personal life, he makes us as persons become capable of
    meeting with him and with one another. But no limitation can
    come upon him as the absolute Person, either from us or from
    our relations with one another; in fact we can dedicate to
    him not merely our persons but also our relations to one
    another. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Buber conceded that there was an apparent
contradiction in the concept of God as an Absolute Person who
cannot be limited and the assertion that his total Being is in
fact limited &quot;by the plurality of other independent
entities&quot; (namely, us). It is possible that Buber here was
addressing himself to Tillich's criticism of the Theistic God who
is only a part of reality, &quot;a being beside others.&quot;
Buber said, however, that this was not really a contradiction: it
was a paradox. And he added the enigmatic statement: &quot;It is
as the absolute Person that God enters into direct relation with
us. The contradiction yields to deeper insight.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson in his book referred to Buber only in
passing, as it were, and did not give him equal billing with
Bultmann, Bonhoeffer, and Tillich as a major source of
inspiration. Wedded as he was to Tillich's denial of Theism, the
bishop certainly did not refer his readers to the passage we have
cited on God as a Person. Nevertheless, his final conclusions
about God or ultimate reality might very well appear to be a
liberal interpretation of that passage, based perhaps on a
&quot;deeper insight.&quot; At Wabash I mentioned to Robinson
that his concept of transcendence seemed to have a strong streak
of Buber in it, and the bishop agreed. &quot;I think what Buber
is saying is fundamental,&quot; he said. &quot;And in fact this
goes back a long way in my own theological experience, because I
did my Ph.D. thesis on Martin Buber, which has never been
published. This was twenty to twenty-five years ago. And
therefore this represents a long-standing influence on my
thinking. And I think the kind of thing Buber is trying to get at
in this I-Thou relationship&#151;the way he sees every finite
Thou as a sort of glimpse through, a 'window through' into
something which meets us in, with, and under every relationship
of life&#151;this is very near the heart of what I am trying to
say.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Did Robinson in fact demythologize Buber? Was Buber
in fact asking to be demythologized? What might it be, that
&quot;deeper insight&quot;? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although he rejected the idea that God is a Person,
the bishop did affirm that God is <i>personal</i>. This may
appear contradictory at first reading, but we must remember that
Robinson was speaking of God as ultimate reality&#151;as the
truth about existence. &quot;For this way of thinking,&quot; he
wrote, &quot;to say that 'God is personal' is to say that
'reality at its very deepest level is personal,' that personality
is of <i>ultimate</i> significance in the constitution of the
universe, that in personal relationships we touch the final
meaning of existence as nowhere else.&quot; And he quoted
Feuerbach: &quot;To predicate personality of God is nothing else
than to predicate personality as the absolute essence.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But personality in itself is not yet the absolute
essence. If it is only in personal relationships that we touch
the final meaning of existence, what, then, is that final
meaning? What, then, is God? The bishop now was prepared to
answer the question. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; God, he said, is love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;To assert that 'God is love' is to believe
that in love one comes into touch with the most fundamental
reality in the universe, that Being itself ultimately has this
character.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the &quot;more&quot; which does not meet
the eye. This is the truth about ourselves and the truth about
Being itself. This is the unconditional demand that is made of
us: that we love one another. And this truth, this ultimate
reality, we have objectivized as God. But God as love does not
imply &quot;a super-Being beyond the world endowed with personal
qualities.&quot; No. &quot;To believe in God as love means to
believe that in pure personal relationship we encounter, not
merely what ought to be, but what is, the deepest, veriest truth
about the structure of reality.&quot; It means to believe that
love is the Ground of our Being. It means that &quot;theological
statements are not a description of 'the highest Being' but an
analysis of the depths of personal relationships.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bishop continued: &quot;A statement is
'theological' not because it relates to a particular Being called
'God' but because it asks <i>ultimate</i> questions about the
meaning of existence: it asks what, at the level of <i>theos</i>,
at the level of its deepest mystery, is the reality and
significance of our life.&quot; And this reality, this final
truth, this God is love. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who, then, was Jesus&#151;the son of God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson demythologized him, too. Jesus was not a
God-man who came from &quot;out there,&quot; pretending to be a
man. He was not a divine visitant who chose to live &quot;like
one of the natives.&quot; According to the bishop, the
traditional view of Jesus leaves one with the impression that
&quot;God took a space ship and arrived on this planet in the
form of a man.&quot; It leaves the impression that Jesus
&quot;was not really one of us . . . he came from outside.&quot;
And that word incarnation: in itself, it &quot;conjures up the
idea of a divine substance being plunged in flesh and coated with
it like chocolate or silver plating.&quot; But Jesus in fact was
a man; he was in fact one of us. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, Jesus also revealed to the world the
Word of God. He was a man, yes&#151;but a man who was completely
united with the Ground of his Being. He made himself
&quot;utterly transparent&quot; to the Ground of Being and thus
offered his fellow-men a window through to ultimate reality. He
did this by emptying himself of self; he was &quot;the man for
others,&quot; and his whole life was a testimony to the fact that
the Ground of all Being is love. I asked the bishop whether the
I-Thou relation did not imply that <i>all</i> men are a window
through to the eternal Thou&#151;hadn't Buber in fact said the
same thing about a cat?&#151; and Robinson answered: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Can I just say two things? First, this
window-through metaphor is obviously very inadequate and just
suggests that God is there to be looked at, whereas the New
Testament takes a far more dynamic view. I mean, here in a real
sense is the activity and love and purpose of God being revealed
and poured out and acting through this man's life. The second
question relates to the uniqueness of Christ. I think I certainly
would not want to say that he is unique in the sense that he is
quite abnormal. I think that it's worth asking: Is Christ unique
because he is normal, or because he is abnormal? Now, I think a
great many people would take from the Gospels as they read them
today that he is unique because he is abnormal&#151;in the sense
that he did all kinds of things we couldn't do, was born in an
entirely different way, had all kinds of miraculous powers, and
so on. Well now, if that is the picture of Christ, then he seems
to me a man who has very little to do with our life at all. It
seems to me what the New Testament fundamentally is saying is
that here is someone who is uniquely normal, what all human life
should be, what a genuinely human existence ought to be. And, on
the whole, this is not true of any other man&#151;we are in a
real sense failing to be what we were meant to be. Now, in that
sense I would certainly say that Christ is unique. But I don't
think he's unique in a sense that cuts him off from the whole of
the rest of humanity. And one of the troubles about so much of
the mythological view of the New Testament is that, for man
today, its effect is to sever this person from everybody else.
After all, the New Testament itself talks about Christ as the
firstborn of many brothers&#151;meaning that there's a real
solidarity here with the whole of the rest of humanity&#151;and I
don't want to draw his uniqueness in any sense which denies this
solidarity, but rather to say that he is the uniquely normal
human being.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In his book Robinson ridiculed supernatural
interpretations of the Atonement&#151;the idea that a divine
Person descended from heaven to save men from sin &quot;in the
way that a man might put his finger into a glass of water to
rescue a struggling insect.&quot; He suggested that sin and hell
are metaphors for man's estrangement from the Ground of his
Being, while union with the Ground of Being &quot;is the meaning
of heaven,&quot; and the experience of grace is the experience of
being accepted in that heaven where, in Tillich's words,
&quot;everything is transformed.&quot; On the level of worship,
the bishop called for a &quot;worldly holiness&quot; and a
&quot;sacred secularity&quot; in which the beyond is sought at
the center of life, &quot;between man and man&quot;&#151;for God
is discovered only in the here and now, in the concrete moment,
in personal relationships: he is not discovered in some other
world, nor is he to be found in the self alone. Finally, the New
Theologian proposed a New Morality&#151;a modern ethic, based on
the Ground of Being, which would take as its credo Saint
Augustine's injunction: &quot;Love God, and do what you
like.&quot; He even suggested that premarital sex might be wrong
only in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, arguing that
&quot;the only intrinsic evil is lack of love.&quot; In an age
that was turning its back on supernatural legalism, he said, he
was only trying to offer a reasonable system, founded on the
absolute priority of love, which could answer that troublesome
question, &quot;Why not?&quot; Thus a boy would not take
liberties with a girl unless he loved her; and if he loved her,
he would not take liberties with her. Or so it seemed to the
bishop. (See his book <i>Christian Morals Today</i>.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson warned his readers not to equate the
eternal Thou with the finite Thou, &quot;nor God with man or
nature.&quot; This, he pointed out, would be pantheism or
humanism, and &quot;Christianity must challenge the assumption of
naturalism that God is merely a redundant name for nature or for
humanity.&quot; With Tillich, he said, he wished instead to push
beyond both supernaturalism <i>and</i> naturalism; it was not his
intention, he said, &quot;to substitute an immanent for a
transcendent Deity,&quot; but rather to reaffirm transcendence in
a new translation. The bishop attempted to demonstrate,
therefore, that his position was not the same as humanism on the
one hand or pantheism on the other. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To rebut the charge of humanism, he returned to his
statement that God is love; this could not be turned around, he
said, to imply that love is God. In other words, divine love is
not simply a projection of human love; on the contrary, human
love is a projection of divine love: it occurs on this earth
because love is the Ground of Being. We recognize human love as
sacred because we see in it the ultimate truth about reality; we
see in it &quot;the divine agape of the universe.&quot; We love
because the Ground of our Being demands that we love. This demand
upon us is unconditional&#151;beyond our control as
individuals&#151;and therefore it transcends us. And this element
of transcendence is what finally distinguishes the humanist from
the radical Christian. The humanist says love <i>ought</i> to be
the final truth about existence; the radical Christian says it
is. Furthermore, the radical Christian says that this final truth
is revealed to us in Jesus Christ, and its validity &quot;stands
or falls&quot; with that revelation. So this in turn is what
finally distinguishes both radical and orthodox Christianity from
all other theologies, Eastern and Western&#151;and, we might add,
from the psychedelic cults. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turning to the next charge, the bishop conceded
that his rejection of Theism might raise in some minds the
specter of the Eastern God. He acknowledged that it was dangerous
to abandon the concept of God as a separate Being. Indeed, he
said, traditionalists might find it hard to believe that his
position &quot;must not result in a theology of mere immanence,
not to say of pantheism.&quot; But, he said, there was one
element which ultimately distinguished his view from the
pantheistic or immanentist position&#151;and this was the element
of personal freedom: the freedom of the individual person to
accept or deny the Ground of his Being. Pantheism is purely
mechanistic or deterministic; concern for the other is as
automatic as two plus two, since in fact there is no other but
only the monistic One, and this concern cannot properly be
described as love, which is a relationship between persons and
not the Selfish awareness of an Absolute Identity. For example,
you are concerned for the welfare of your arms and legs, but you
would hardly refer to this concern as love. I am extrapolating
now&#151; trying to read the bishop's mind, as it were&#151;but I
trust this is close to his meaning. The &quot;I&quot; is real, as
is the Thou, but the two are bound together by God. And God is
love. This is what it means to say that God is personal but not a
Person. Love is the very Ground of our Being; but so too is
independence an essential aspect of our Being: indeed it must be,
if love is also, for the one implies the other. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Extrapolating again, it might be suggested that we
worship not God&#151;the word itself would seem to indicate a
Person&#151; but rather perhaps a symbolic X. Maybe we should
offer up our prayers to Love, which in fact is what we do. All
day long the radio blares the message, flooding our homes and our
autos with songs of love and little else&#151;news, sports, and
love: that is the prescribed formula&#151;and our literature,
too, seems preoccupied with the theme. Some call it sex; but is
it really God? What sends the unhappy young man wandering the
lonely streets of night in search of Her? Is it God who sends
him, the Ground of his Being? If God is love we are a pious
nation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We shall not belabor the possible parallels between
Robinson's demythologized Christianity and many of the Eastern or
psychedelic concepts we have already discussed. They should be
obvious. What especially stands out, of course, is the idea of
immanence, and the reader will decide for himself whether the
bishop has managed to slam the door in time. Or has pantheism
slipped in? To many it may appear that the bishop is hanging by
his fingernails over those chasms we mentioned, as far as
transcendence is concerned, and it would be worthwhile to take
one last look at his definition of this term. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems fair to say that Robinson has made the
term <i>transcendent</i> synonymous with the term <i>unconditional</i>.
Love is a built-in aspect of existence; it is not ours to
command; it is the essence which precedes our existence; it is
the &quot;more&quot; which does not meet the eye and which does
not yield itself to the scrutiny of an empirical science. As the
bishop put it to me: &quot;Here is something before which you
say, yes, this is it. Here I stand, I can no other. I think this <i>is</i>
something in a real sense that confronts one, engages one, from
outside. It's not something one thinks up for oneself. It
clearly, as I see it, is describing how things <i>are</i>. You
say, well, here is something fundamentally true which I cannot
escape.&quot; For example perhaps, one does not think up
breathing for oneself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But some critics might argue that an unconditional
&quot;more&quot; is not really the same as a transcendent
&quot;other,&quot; and &quot;in a real sense&quot; is, after all,
a deceptive phrase; it sounds positive, but actually it weakens
and modifies more than it reinforces&#151;that is to say, it
implies <i>&quot;as if,&quot;</i> not <i>&quot;is.&quot;</i> It
is significant that the bishop did not say simply: &quot;This is
something that confronts one from outside.&quot; Because he did
not say this, and probably could not, it is debatable whether
Robinson was successful in his effort to validate transcendence
for popular theology, since transcendence has always implied
&quot;outside,&quot; &quot;other,&quot; or &quot;separate,&quot;
and the bishop's God displays none of these qualities. It is not
enough to say this God transcends the individual, since
transcendence has always implied something more than just this;
it has implied a divinity that transcends mankind as a
whole&#151;and not in the sense of being unconditional, but
rather in the sense of being separate and superior (at least <i>partly</i>
separate, and wholly superior). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson of course was well aware of this, and it
was precisely this implication he was trying to combat with his
new definition. It might be argued that Robinson did not actually
redefine transcendence; it might be argued that he substituted an
altogether different concept. &quot;Deep,&quot; for example, is
not a redefinition of &quot;tall,&quot; and unconditional, in
this sense, is not a redefinition of transcendent. But this may
be quibbling; substitution and redefinition shade into each
other, and perhaps there is a sense in which the bishop's God
&quot;as it were&quot; transcends us. (&quot;As it were&quot; is
another of the bishop's favorite phrases.) If you think about it
a long while, there will be moments when you say yes&#151;and
moments when you say no, or maybe. It is not an easy concept to
get your mind around; it is, if you like, rather vague (or
mysterious), and you will see perhaps why we objected to talk of
a vague pantheism. Pantheism is very easy. By comparison, one can
well appreciate the frustration of the critic who described
Robinson as a confused man who is confusing others. There are,
however, a great many people who would say that the bishop has
provided them with something other than confusion. From one point
of view, he may have taken away their silver&#151;but returned
them gold. In an era of subjective chaos, he has made religion
meaningful again for untold thousands. While he may well have
scuttled transcendence in its traditional interpretation&#151;may
indeed have lost it altogether&#151;his system does retain the
Western concept of pluralism. And this in the final test could
prove to have more significance even than transcendence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the bishop himself has acknowledged this.
You will recall the argument, derived from Tillich, that atheism
collapses if you define God simply as ultimate reality. Then it
is necessary to debate only the nature of this ultimate reality,
the bishop said. And he added this: &quot;One can only ask what
ultimate reality is like&#151;whether, for instance, in the last
analysis what lies at the heart of things and governs their
working is to be described in personal or impersonal
categories.&quot; That perhaps is the real question, and not
transcendence. That perhaps is the basis of the more fundamental
challenge which is offered to the West by LSD and by Eastern
metaphysics. The bishop of course took the position that ultimate
reality is personal, and this is another way of saying that it is
pluralistic: &quot;love,&quot; &quot;relation,&quot;
&quot;personal&quot;&#151;all these are pluralistic words,
opposed to monism. They preserve the integrity both of Thou and
&quot;I.&quot; If God is love, he cannot be Atman. If God is
personal, there is no One. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have said, however, that the instant remedy for
atheism contains within it a possible flaw. As Robinson saw it,
&quot;one cannot argue whether ultimate reality exists,&quot; and
we have quoted Tillich's assertion: nobody can say or think that
life has no depth, that life is shallow. But in fact men can and
do assert that ultimate reality does not exist, that life is
shallow and has no depth. Existence, some say, is absurd. Life is
a joke &#151;a rather ghastly one at that&#151;and there is no
ultimate reality in the sense of an unconditional purpose or
meaning. For atheistic existentialists, such as Sartre, there is
no Ground of Being, no unconditional, no primary state of Being
in any sense; not only is there no God, there is no such thing
even as a definite human nature, for existence precedes essence.
And what does this mean? &quot;It means,&quot; said Sartre,
&quot;that, first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the
scene, and, only afterward, defines himself.&quot; In the
beginning is subjectivity. In the beginning, man is nothing.
&quot;Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will
have made what he will be.... Man is nothing else but what he
makes of himself.&quot; He must choose what he will be, and that
terrible responsibility is his alone. Man, to his horror, is born
free. He is, indeed, &quot;condemned to be free.&quot; He is
&quot;condemned every moment to invent man.&quot; There are no
determinisms. There is, said Sartre, &quot;no human nature for me
to depend on.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We are alone, with no excuses.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson perhaps recognized his own error, for he
also wrote: &quot;The question of God is the question whether
this depth of being is a reality or an illusion.&quot; And the
next question, then, is obvious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; True or false&#151;how does one decide? How does
one determine whether the Ground of Being is real or not? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is first of all the possibility of rational
proof. But those who hold to this possibility have had many
centuries in which to produce their evidence, and the evidence
has not been universally convincing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is next the possibility of
revelation&#151;and especially, for the bishop, the possibility
of revelation through Jesus Christ. I asked Robinson why the
radical Christian says that love is the final truth, as opposed
to the humanist who says it ought to be, and the bishop said:
&quot;I think that this is defined and vindicated in Christ. And
personally, unless I saw this in Christ, and really felt that
this was the clue, then there are so many things in our modern
world which would suggest otherwise that I should find it very
difficult to hang on to this. But this is in a sense, I think,
the sort of knot in the thread.&quot; But the knot was tied
almost two thousand years ago, and there are signs today it is
coming undone. The revelation existed when the modern world came
into being, and men ever since have paid less and less heed to
it. Today men have eyes to see, and they do not see; they have
ears to hear, and they do not hear. Or so it might appear to the
church at least. &quot;Often enough,&quot; said Buber, &quot;we
think there is nothing to hear, but long before we have ourselves
put wax in our ears.&quot; So the problem perhaps is basic
enough. How can men be made to look and see, listen and hear? How
can the scales be removed from their eyes and the wax from their
ears? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson's solution was to demythologize, or
redefine, and this for many has been richly rewarding. But is it
enough? In itself, after all, it is rational analysis
again&#151;and this alone has never been enough. It may serve to
illuminate or to justify a truth that has been intuitively
perceived, however vaguely. But what if that perception was
lacking to begin with? Are we not thrown back once more on the
primary necessity for a direct inner experience of the ultimate
reality, which is God and the Ground of our Being? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This issue is implicit in the New Theology's
response to secularization. Many New Theologians have taken
Bonhoeffer to mean that the church should turn exclusively to
this world, becoming secular itself&#151;that religion should be
made &quot;relevant&quot; by involving it full scale in social
and political issues, and, in a more shallow sense, by adapting
it to contemporary mores and the modern idiom (beat prayers, jam
sessions at the altar). But is this what people really want from
religion? Or do they seek instead that intimate, personal
encounter which in turn is the ultimate <i>basis</i> for social
action? Are the secularizers putting the cart before the horse?
In their reaction against otherworldliness, do they threaten a
further diminution of that mystical element for which LSD seems
to demonstrate a widespread hunger? There is no simple answer,
but the problem is there. And so LSD perhaps challenges not only
orthodoxy but also one aspect at least of radical theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robinson himself is not limited to this one aspect;
he is not to be identified with the secularizers
alone&#151;although Altizer has so identified him. Certainly he
has a good deal of sympathy for this school, which derives
largely from Bonhoeffer. But, as he put it to me, &quot;There is
a whole other side which I took over from Tillich, and there is a
whole lot for instance in Teilhard de Chardin, and others, which
I think is equally important.&quot; This other side, of course,
represents the mystical-philosophical approach to
theology&#151;or, in other words, the metaphysical school.
&quot;What I'm trying to do,&quot; Robinson said, &quot;is to
combine this with the sort of thing that the prophets of
secularization are saying, and I don't want to have to choose
between them.&quot; The bishop indeed has shared Saint Thomas'
penchant for synthesis&#151;he has not been an either/or thinker,
and this no doubt explains why some have thought him confused or
confusing. While many of his basic viewpoints were drawn from
mystical philosophy, however, and while mystics such as Tillich
and Buber have been his own inspiration, the bishop in his book
nevertheless took a dim view of mysticism for the average person,
and of mysticism as a solution. He wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our contention has been that God is to be met not by a
    &quot;religious&quot; turning away from the world but in
    unconditional concern for &quot;the other&quot; <i>seen
    through to its ultimate depths....</i> That there are
    veridical experiences of the type usually called
    &quot;mystical&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; no one would be
    so foolish as to deny, and a man may thank God for them as
    St. Paul did for his visions. But the capacity for religious
    or mystical awareness, as for aesthetic or psychic awareness,
    is largely a question of natural endowment. Women, for
    instance, appear to be naturally more religious&#151;and more
    psychic&#151;than men. To make the knowledge of God depend
    upon such experiences is like making it depend on an ear for
    music. There are those who are tone-deaf, and there are those
    who would not claim to have any clearly distinguishable
    &quot;religious&quot; experiences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, in our own conversation, I asked Robinson if
Bonhoeffer was not, among other things, rejecting what the bishop
referred to as churchiness. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Robinson.
&quot;He's also certainly rejecting any view of religion which
sees it just as a compartment of life and sees the church as a
sort of religious club for those who like that sort of
thing&#151;which indeed it very largely is. That is one of the
troubles. It exists to meet the needs of religiously minded
people&#151;which seems to me a great distortion of the real
function of the church, which is much more concerned with the
making holy of the common, with the transformation of the whole
of life, and not simply in providing the same sort of function
that, say, a musical club does for those who like music.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously, as the bishop has interpreted it,
Bonhoeffer's rejection of &quot;religion&quot; is nothing more or
less than a rejection of mysticism in the sense that we have
defined it. The question remains, how does one manage to <i>see</i>
the holy in the common, and how is the whole of life to <i>be</i>
transformed unless there is, to begin with, some inner experience
corresponding to a mystical awareness? You cannot simply tell
people to see the holy, or point it out to them, and no New
Theology, however radical, is going to transform the whole of
life. If people cannot find ultimate reality in Jesus Christ,
they are not going to find it in Tillich. It could be argued that
more churchiness is just what is needed. Robinson of course had
no intrinsic objection to mysticism; on the contrary, he was
merely facing the fact that most people cannot achieve the state.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or could not, the drug movement would say. If
everybody in the world would take LSD tonight, under the proper
conditions, it is possible that tomorrow there would be millions
more of the praying type. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here, then, in its full scope, is LSD's challenge
to New Theology. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for New Theology's own challenge to orthodoxy,
the traditionalists have taken comfort in the fact that Robinson
since publication of his book has more or less dropped that
phrase Ground of Being. The idea seems to be that this was some
sort of capitulation, and a collective sigh of relief was heard.
Robinson indicated to me, however, that he had tended to
&quot;shear off&quot; the phrase simply because &quot;it
obviously seems to cause so much misunderstanding.&quot; A great
many people, he said, &quot;have assumed this is a purely
impersonal phrase and is the enemy of belief in God as in any
sense a personal reality.&quot; That of course is not the way he
interpreted it himself. I asked him if the book still stood, or
if he had changed his viewpoint in any fundamental area. &quot;I
think basically it still stands,&quot; he said. He had not in
fact read the book since it was last in proof. &quot;But I
wouldn't say that radically I have regretted anything I have
written, or changed it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they were not denouncing him for heresy, the
bishop's critics tried the opposite tack. After all, he was
saying nothing more than the church itself had always said. It
was old stuff. During a public debate at Wabash, for example,
Professor J. V. Langmead Casserley of Seabury-Western Theological
Seminary declared the bishop was &quot;profoundly in harmony with
the deepest theological opinions of the church.&quot; The bishop
was being honest to God perhaps, but dishonest to history. Well,
the bishop never said his stuff was new. He did say it was not
being communicated&#151;a fact attested to, perhaps, by the
incredible spark-to-tinder response his book produced in the
pews. Robinson has been criticized for fogginess, as noted, and
Casserley charged he had &quot;befuddled the minds of men both
inside and outside the church to a quite unprecedented
degree.&quot; But there was one man at least for whom the
bishop's meaning seemed perfectly clear. And that was Thomas J.
J. Altizer. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a talk I had with him, Altizer had no difficulty
whatever in assessing the bishop&#151;as an opponent. He
identified Robinson as one who was trying desperately to salvage
the core of traditional Christian theology, which Altizer
rejected. It was rather astonishing to find the bishop emerging,
from one point of view, as a kind of Red Cross Knight and
defender of the faith. To mix the metaphor, and possibly to
strain it, he might be described as a man trying to jettison
excess cargo from an aircraft which was dropping perilously close
to those peaks identified on theological charts as Altizer and
Hamilton, Nietzsche and Sartre. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From another point of view, however, it might be
said that Robinson opened the door&#151;and Altizer slipped in. </p>
