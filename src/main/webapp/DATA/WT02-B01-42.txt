<h2>CLAIM VIII: DRUG CONTROL SPENDING IS A MINOR PORTION OF THE
U.S. BUDGET, AND COMPARED TO THE COSTS OF DRUG ABUSE, SPENDING IS
MINUSCULE. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that this nation has spent
billions of dollars to control drug production, trafficking and
use with few, if any, positive results. They contend that the
money spent on drug control should be shifted to other, more
productive endeavors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This whole claim is another curious argument. It seems that
the DEA is saying, &quot;We don't take very much money in the
bigger scheme of things, so leave us alone.&quot; From my own
perspective, I still regard several billion dollars as a lot of
money. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that a lot of money is spent on drug
enforcement and there is no doubt that even the DEA has never
claimed that it ever had any significant effect on reducing the
supply of drugs. If a program to spend several billion dollars is
as useless as this one, it behooves us to look for a better
approach. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The truth is, we have made great progress in reducing drug use
during the past 15 years. If the relatively modest outlays of
Federal dollars had not been made, drug abuse and attendant
social costs would have been far greater. The good news is that
drug use has declined significantly between 1979 and 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Whether drug use has been significantly reduced is open to
question, particularly in view of the survey methods used to
arrive at such conclusions. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed that this statement is true, it would still
leave open the question of whether any other approach might have
produced better results. That is a question the DEA does not even
want to consider. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts participating in the Anti-Legalization forum
disputed the claim that money allegedly saved from giving up on
the drug problem could be better spent on education and social
problems. When compared to the amount of funding that is spent on
other national priorities, drug control spending is minimal.
There has been progress in reducing drug use, and the money spent
has been effective and worthwhile. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This argument is illogical. The participants state that the
money could not be better spent on education and social problems
because &quot;drug control spending is minimal.&quot; Whether the
spending is minimal (by their terms) has no bearing on whether
the spending is wise. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>On the surface, legalization proponents present an appealing,
simple argument that by legalizing drugs we can move vast sums of
money from drug law enforcement into solving society's ills. They
leave unanswered questions about the cost of collecting revenues
associated with drug sales, or the cost of regulating drugs. </p>

<p>They ignore questions concerning the purity, potency and
quality of legal drugs, the costs of insuring a safe product, and
costs associated with increased liability litigation. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No revenue is collected from drug sales now, except by outlaw
drug dealers. Any collection of tax revenues would be an
improvement. </p>

<p>There are no standards for purity, potency, or quality now
except those established by outlaw drug dealers, and there is no
one to sue for an unsafe product. Any legal standards would be an
improvement in this area. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask proponents of legalization for specifics. Would the raw
material for these drugs be purchased from traditional sources,
or would the United States produce its own marijuana, coca and
opium? Would the government pay farmers subsidies to produce or
not produce these crops? Although all of these questions could be
resolved, none comes without a price tag. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The United States could easily produce all of its own
marijuana, as the DEA should know from the fact that it was
America's largest commercial crop before it was outlawed. </p>

<p>The Federal Government should not be in the position of paying
farmers subsidies to produce any dangerous, addictive drug,
including tobacco. The rules for subsidies should be consistent
across the board. </p>

<p>However difficult these questions may be to agree on, it still
does not present any evidence that throwing people in prison for
drugs is a good idea. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents also conveniently fail to mention that unless drugs
are made available to little children, law enforcement will still
be needed to deal with the sale of drugs to minors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is one of the phoniest arguments to come down the pike.
No one except the DEA has suggested that drugs should be
&quot;made available to little children&quot;. </p>

<p>We have laws now to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors and
the rules for other drugs should be no different. Law enforcement
is needed to deal with the sale of alcohol to minors but it is by
no means an overwhelming problem. </p>

<p>If the DEA was really concerned about little children, they
would recommend stronger action against convenience store clerks
who sell tobacco to children. An American is about 100 times as
likely to die from tobacco as from any illegal drug, and
childhood is when most of them become addicted. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But more importantly, in their simplistic arguments, they omit
mention of the atrocious social costs that would be incurred with
a larger class of drug users. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, we freely admit that drugs are going to impose a
tremendous social cost whatever we do. That is still not a good
reason to undertake actions which are counterproductive, such as
prison. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization would also result in lost workforce productivity
and a resultant increase in the cost of goods. A new class of
unemployables would be created who were unfit to hire because of
their drug dependence. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no evidence for this at all. The DEA proposes that
prison is the best way to keep drug users productive. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would also
increase, the panel predicted. Drug treatment costs,
hospitalization for longterm drugrelated disease, and treatment
of family violence consequences would further burden our already
strapped healthcare system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The panel came together for the purpose of fighting
&quot;legalization&quot; so it is no surprise that they would
predict it would be a disaster. It is important to note that they
did no research to back up their prediction and every major study
of drug policy in the last fifty years disagreed with them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There was also no guarantee, according to the group, that
criminal justice costs would decline if drugs were legalized. It
is possible that law enforcement would be additionally burdened
with addressing violations of traffic and family violence laws if
more people had access to drugs. Law enforcement is already
challenged by significant alcoholrelated crimes. More users mean
more crimes committed, and incarceration costs would increase. </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>· In 1995, over $13 billion is being spent by the federal
government on drug control, including treatment, education, law
enforcement and international activities. </p>

<p>· Drug abuse costs the United States between $60 and $100
billion in lost productivity each year. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Most of this cost is caused by alcohol, which the DEA does not
address at all. Even if all this cost was the result of illegal
drugs, there is still no evidence that throwing people in prison
is the best way to reduce those costs. Does the DEA honestly
propose that the best way to make sure that people are productive
is to throw them in prison? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· The Federal Government spends billions of dollars each year
on other national priorities. In Fiscal Year 1995, the Federal
Government is spending </p>

<p>$ 243.4 billion on Defense </p>

<p>$ 350 billion on Social Security </p>

<p>$ 61.6 billion on Agriculture </p>

<p>$ 22 billion on Welfare </p>

<p>$ 13.5 billion on Foreign Assistance </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And? Not one word here is any kind of an argument in favor of
throwing people in prison for drugs. <br>
