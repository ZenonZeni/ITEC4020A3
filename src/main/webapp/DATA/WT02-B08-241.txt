William Mills is <b>Librarian and Information Officer</b> of the Scott Polar 
Research Institute.  He 
graduated in Geography from the University of Cambridge in 1973.  Following several 
years as a teacher, he obtained professional qualifications in Librarianship in 1981 at the 
College of Librarianship, University of Wales Aberystwyth, and prior to his appointment at 
Scott Polar, worked in the libraries of Aston University, Bristol Polytechnic and  
School of Geography, Oxford University.<p>

In addition to being responsible for the Institute's <a href="../../lib/libhome.htm">Library 
and Information Service</a> and Editor of 
<a href="http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk/Journals/JNLSCAT/pga/pga.html">Polar and 
Glaciological Abstracts</a>, he runs the <a href="../../lectures.htm">SPRI Public Lecture 
Series</a> - held on alternate Saturdays through the Michaelmas and Lent Terms.  He has 
also organized two international conferences - Britain in the Arctic (1990) and the 15th 
Polar Libraries Colloquy (1994) - and has, since 1994, been Secretary / Treasurer of 
the <a href="http://www.urova.fi/home/arktinen/polarweb/polarweb.htm">Polar Libraries 
Colloquy</a>.<p>

Whilst his primary responsibilities at SPRI concern the efficient running of the Library,
mindful of the scholarly reputation of his predecessors, he has ambitious plans for
future studies and publications and is currently working on a guide to information sources -
printed, electronic and manuscript - due for publication in 1997.<p>
