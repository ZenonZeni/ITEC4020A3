<PRE>


    16                    MS. KAPPLER:  Good morning, your Honor, it's Ann

    17           Kappler from Jenner and Block for the ALA plaintiffs.  Please

    18           excuse my voice, I have a little cold.  At this time the

    19           plaintiffs would like to call Robert Croneberger.

    20                    THE COURT CLERK:  Good morning, sir.  Would you

    21           please state and spell your name?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Robert, R-o-b-e-r-t, B., Croneberger,

    23           C-r-o-n-e-b-e-r-g-e-r.

    24                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please raise your right hand.

    25                    ROBERT B. CRONEBERGER, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

                                                                            95

     1                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you.  Please be seated.

     2                    MS. KAPPLER:  At this time plaintiffs move into

     3           evidence the supplemental declaration of Mr. Croneberger as

     4           his direct trial testimony.  Mr. Croneberger executed the

     5           supplemental declaration on March 19th and it was previously

     6           submitted to this Court.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection?

     8                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No objection.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then it will be accepted.

    10                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor.  I would like

    11           to make one correction, if I might, in Mr. Croneberger's

    12           declaration, and this is a clerical error on the part of my

    13           office.  In Paragraph 21 there is a reference to Plaintiffs'

    14           Exhibit 203, this is his discussion of the RIM study as it

    15           appears on their server, that should be a reference to

    16           Exhibits 203 and 204.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    19                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you.  The Government has

    20           previously --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government have that

    22           change?

    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, thank you.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.

    25                    MS. KAPPLER:  The Government has previously

                                                                            96

     1           indicated that they did not have any cross-examination for

     2           Mr. Croneberger, so we are presenting Mr. Croneberger for the

     3           Courts' questions.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, but we're going to give the

     5           Government a chance to say that.

     6                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Actually the Government will have

     7           cross-examination.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There you go.

     9                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    10           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    11           Q   Good morning, Mr. Croneberger, how are you?

    12           A   Good morning.  Fine, thank you.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are you on the tape today?

    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I will reintroduce myself.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    16                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  My name is Patricia Russotto, I'm an

    17           attorney at the Department of Justice, representing the

    18           Department of Justice in this action.

    19           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    20           Q   Now, Dr. Croneberger, you are director of the Carnegie

    21           Library, correct?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   In Pittsburgh?

    24           A   Yes.

    25                    (Laughter.)

                                                                            97

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll never forget it.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  But not Carnegie Mellon Library.

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, I understand.

     4           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

     5           Q   Now, the Carnegie Library has available on line a variety

     6           of materials, is that right?

     7           A   Correct.

     8           Q   And included in the on-line materials that are available

     9           you have a computerized card catalogue system, right?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   Which has all of the materials that are available in the

    12           Carnegie Library collection -- well, I'll back off on that,

    13           we went through this in your deposition.

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   It has about two million of the items that are available

    16           in your collection, correct?

    17           A   That's right, yes.

    18           Q   And you also have available on line some of the full

    19           texts of journal articles that the library subscribes to,

    20           correct?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   And would that also include -- do you also have some

    23           books available in full text as well on line?

    24           A   No, except through the Internet.

    25           Q   Right, okay.  Now, your electronic card catalogue

                                                                            98

     1           contains information about these two million -- some two

     2           million of the items that you have in your collection, right?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   And some of the catalogue entries do contain references

     5           to sex, right?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   And some of them contain four-letter words, correct?

     8           A   Correct.

     9           Q   And what we would characterize as the seven dirty words,

    10           for purposes of this examination, right?

    11           A   Correct.

    12           Q   And when these references to sex or these references to

    13           the seven dirty words do appear in your card catalogue those

    14           words are a part of the title of the work or part of a

    15           content description of the work, is that right?

    16           A   Yes.  It could possibly be headings or subject headings

    17           or cross-references or footnotes that the cataloguers have

    18           added, yes.

    19           Q   Okay.  But some of these, for example, if we're talking

    20           about the title of a book that appears in your card

    21           catalogue, perhaps The Joy of Sex would be one where sex

    22           comes up, right?

    23           A   Correct.

    24           Q   And I believe you also have in your collection

    25           videotapes, right?

                                                                            99

     1           A   Correct.

     2           Q   So, perhaps "Sex, Lies and Videotape" would be one of the

     3           titles that would come up in your card catalogue, right?

     4           A   Correct.

     5           Q   And when we're talking about music, you have a collection

     6           of CD's as well, correct?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           Q   And I believe you've gone through in your declaration

     9           some examples of the types of CD's that would have some of

    10           the seven dirty words either in the title or in the

    11           description of the contents of the CD, correct?

    12           A   Correct.

    13           Q   But these all appear in a card catalogue, right?

    14           A   That's right.

    15           Q   And after finding a reference to these works in the card

    16           catalogue the library patron generally has to then go

    17           physically to your stacks and either select the book or pick

    18           out the CD or take the videotape off the shelf to take it

    19           home, right?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   They don't just go directly from your electronic

    22           catalogue to the text of whatever it is that they have

    23           selected that they would like to take a look at, right?

    24           A   Except in the case of on-line journals of course, yes.

    25           Q   Right, okay.  Now, the catalogue entries themselves are

                                                                           100

     1           not actually prepared by Carnegie Library for the most part,

     2           are they?

     3           A   Not for the most part.

     4           Q   For the most part you get them from the Library of

     5           Congress, is that right?

     6           A   Yes, we get them electronically through the Ohio Center

     7           for Library Cataloguing, and they're downloaded that way

     8           electronically.  Most of -- the majority of those entries, at

     9           least the popular ones come directly from cataloguing from

    10           the Library of Congress, which is loaded electronically into

    11           the OCLC center.

    12           Q   So, you get it electronically, it's already been prepared

    13           and you get it electronically and simply insert it into your

    14           catalogue system?

    15           A   That's correct.

    16           Q   Now --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me a second.  Is it your

    18           testimony that the Library of Congress gives the information

    19           to this Ohio center and then the Ohio center puts it in

    20           machine-readable form or --

    21                    THE WITNESS:  No --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- in electronic form?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  No, the Library of Congress puts it--

    24           transfers it electronically.  All -- many large libraries,

    25           even I understand Harvard --

                                                                           101

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- contribute, as does the Carnegie

     3           Library of Pittsburgh, to this electronic data base that's

     4           gathered and collected in Ohio, and we all download, for a

     5           fee, through this center electronically.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, the Library of Congress, as well

     7           as --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  They're one of the partners --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- other providers --

    10                    THE WITNESS:  -- yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- that's the central source is this

    12           Ohio center?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Correct.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that Ohio University or

    15           something, or University of Ohio?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  It started at Ohio University, but it

    17           has now split off into an independent organization and it

    18           split off to provide that kind of electronic services.

    19           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    20           Q   Now, your card catalogue that you have on line, that can

    21           be searched by key words, can't it?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   And I believe that in Paragraph 32 of your declaration

    24           you have indicated that you would have to hire some 180

    25           additional staff in order to search all two million items

                                                                           102

     1           that are in your catalogue, correct?

     2                    MR. MORRIS:  Could I give a copy of --

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Oh, I'm sorry.

     4                    MR. MORRIS:  -- this declaration --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, by all means.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And could you give a paragraph

     8           citation?

     9                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  It's Paragraph 32.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

    11                    (Pause.)

    12           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    13           Q   So, you have said that you would have to hire about 180

    14           additional staff in order to search all two million items in

    15           your card catalogue, is that right?

    16           A   Yes.  If we had to search them manually and if we had to

    17           employ professionals or paraprofessionals, yes, that's

    18           correct, of our current -- just of our current collections.

    19           Q   Right, but you did say that you could do a key-word

    20           search though through the card catalogue for words related to

    21           sex or the seven dirty words, isn't that right?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   And if you do a key-word search then not all two million

    24           of your catalogue entries are going to contain any reference

    25           to sex or to the seven dirty words, are they?

                                                                           103

     1           A   Well, it entirely depends, certainly that's one of our

     2           confusions under the Act, it entirely depends on what one

     3           means by indecent or how it is described or what terminology

     4           is being used or, indeed, to what level of extent the search

     5           might be, that is, whether it's on content pages or whether

     6           it's on chapters, it would be very difficult to know.

     7           Q   Well, for example then a key-word search on the topic of

     8           sex, for example, for everything that's in your card

     9           catalogue, all the entries in your card catalogue that have

    10           the word sex in them, a key-word search like that is not

    11           likely, do you think, to turn up books about gardening, for

    12           example?

    13           A   I certainly wouldn't know, but I would doubt it.

    14           Q   You do have books about gardening at the Carnegie

    15           Library, right?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And a key-word search for the term sex isn't going to

    18           turn up books about physics?

    19           A   Excuse me --

    20           Q   Not very likely anyway?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   You agree with that, that it's not likely to turn up

    23           books about physics?

    24           A   Well, it's likely to turn up -- obviously plants

    25           proliferate and flowers grow, and it depends entirely upon

                                                                           104

     1           the kind of terminology you're using, sure.

     2           Q   Okay.  Well, what about a biography of Abraham Lincoln,

     3           do you think that would turn up in a key-word search using

     4           the word sex?

     5           A   I certainly have written -- I mean I certainly have read

     6           some articles and some journal entries about Abraham

     7           Lincoln's supposed or lack of sex life, yes.

     8           Q   Okay.  What about books about travel, would they turn up,

     9           do you think, in a book about -- in a key-word search for the

    10           word sex?

    11           A   Certainly possibly, but not likely.

    12           Q   What about books about geology, for example, would they

    13           turn up in a key-word search for the word sex?

    14           A   Probably only if the rock is put together with roll and,

    15           in that case, yes.

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17           Q   Okay.

    18           A   I'm sorry, your Honors, I apologize.  Probably not.

    19           Q   Probably not, thank you.

    20                    (Laughter.)

    21           Q   Well, would you agree that a key-word search for the word

    22           sex is likely to turn up something less than all two million

    23           of your card catalogue entries?

    24           A   Yes, if that three-letter word were the only key word

    25           being used, of course, yes.

                                                                           105

     1           Q   Well, would you agree also that a key-word search for the

     2           seven dirty words are also likely to turn up something less

     3           than all two million entries at the Carnegie Library?

     4           A   Indeed.

     5           Q   Now, I think you have also said, and I'm referring to

     6           Paragraph 22 of your declaration, that you have the full text

     7           of some magazine articles on line as well, correct?

     8           A   Correct.

     9           Q   And I believe the specific examples that you gave in your

    10           declaration were Cosmopolitan, Vanity Fair and Playboy.  The

    11           Cosmopolitan magazine that you have on line I'm assuming is

    12           the same Cosmopolitan magazine that one can buy at the

    13           grocery store check-out counter, is that right?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   And the same Vanity Fair is the same Vanity Fair that you

    16           can pick up at the newsstand, right?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   And Playboy is the same Playboy you would pick up

    19           anywhere, I assume?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   Do you carry the pictures from Playboy as well?

    22           A   Not at the present time, the -- all of these on-line

    23           magazines come through a commercial vendor called the

    24           information access corporation and at the present time only

    25           the abstracts and indexes for Playboy is part of that

                                                                           106

     1           licensing agreement that they have with IAC.

     2           Q   I see.  So, someone who is accessing or trying to get on

     3           line and get the text of a Playboy article wouldn't find the

     4           pictures then?

     5           A   Not through our on-line magazine access, correct.

     6           Q   Now, referring to Paragraph 11 of your declaration, you

     7           said that it is one of the missions of the Carnegie Library

     8           to provide, quote, "the widest array of information to the

     9           widest possible audience, both adults and minors," correct?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   But you don't provide your library patrons with every

    12           type of information that might be available in the world, do

    13           you?

    14           A   No, of course not.

    15           Q   You do exercise some discretion over what is selected to

    16           become part of the collection at the Carnegie Library?

    17           A   Yes.  And then those discretionary things are made up a

    18           lot of different reasons and parameters, yes --

    19           Q   Yes.

    20           A   -- one of them is economics and one of them is -- all

    21           different kinds of things, sure.

    22           Q   And we talked about some of those when we took your

    23           deposition on I believe it was Saturday, correct?

    24           A   Right.

    25           Q   And I believe that during your deposition you identified

                                                                           107

     1           some of those selection criteria as community standards and

     2           value of the material, right?

     3           A   Correct.

     4           Q   And in fact I believe that you told me in your deposition

     5           that you, quote, "try to" -- I will show you the page

     6           reference actually before I quote this.

     7                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  May I approach, your Honor?

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you may.

     9                    (Pause.)

    10           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    11           Q   Well, let me ask you it a different way, since I do not

    12           seem to have a copy --

    13                    MR. MORRIS:  We have a copy of it.

    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Do you have a copy of it?  Oh, thank

    15           you.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I apologize.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, it's consistent with the

    20           relationship that we've noted throughout.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And commend.

    22           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    23           Q   I was referring to Page 35 of your deposition and it is

    24           the end of one of your responses where you had said, quote,

    25           that in fact when you select these materials you try to

                                                                           108

     1           reflect what you perceive to be the community standards of

     2           your community, is that right?

     3           A   Correct.

     4           Q   So, that is a correct statement of one of the criteria

     5           that you would use in selecting materials?

     6           A   Yes.  And I think if I -- that I say in addition to that

     7           statement right at the same time that it's not -- it isn't

     8           and cannot ever be the only criteria and that -- I go on to

     9           say that I have an informal definition of a public library as

    10           a place with material that offends every one and that's our

    11           task, our job.

    12           Q   Right, I understand that, thank you.

    13           A   Sure.

    14           Q   But you don't have Penthouse and Playboy in your

    15           collection, do you?

    16           A   Well, we have Playboy, yes.

    17           Q   But you don't have the magazine available in hard copy,

    18           do you?

    19           A   That's correct, we do not.

    20           Q   You don't have Penthouse, right?

    21           A   That's correct.

    22           Q   And you don't have Hustler, correct?

    23           A   That is correct.

    24           Q   And among your video selections you don't have sexually

    25           explicit adult films either, do you?

                                                                           109

     1           A   That's right, we do not.

     2                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I don't have anything further, your

     3           Honor.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Any redirect?

     5                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor, yes.

     6                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     7           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

     8           Q   Mr. Croneberger, you mentioned that as currently now

     9           provided Playboy appears in simply an abstract form that you

    10           put it on line?

    11           A   Correct.

    12           Q   If the commercial provider who provided this information,

    13           these journals to you were to provide Playboy in full text

    14           would you post that magazine on line in full text?

    15           A   Of course, certainly.

    16           Q   And if it included Playboy magazine, delivered it to you

    17           in full text including pictures, would you post it in that

    18           form on line?

    19           A   Yes, we would.

    20           Q   Have you made a determination with your computer staff as

    21           to whether you could use a simple key-word search in order to

    22           ferret out the material that you post on line that might be

    23           subject to the Act?

    24           A   Yes, we have certainly discussed it at some length and we

    25           think it's not feasible, it's simply not possible to do given

                                                                           110

     1           the nature of communication and the nature of words and the

     2           difficulty of coming up with all of the parameters that seem

     3           to be, at least to us, a part of this Act, it would be

     4           extremely difficult to do, impossible to do.

     5           Q   And I'd like --

     6           A   Because we're talking -- I'm sorry, we're talking not

     7           only about tables of contents, but we're also talking about

     8           each edition of each magazine, each edition of each

     9           periodical.

    10           Q   And am I correct that if you were to devise some kind of

    11           a key-word search do you feel you could assure yourself that

    12           you had located every item that you posted on line that might

    13           be subject to the Act?

    14           A   No, we could not.

    15                    MS. KAPPLER:  I have no further questions, your

    16           Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Any recross, Ms. Russotto?

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I'm sorry.

    20                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  None, your Honor.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, a few questions.  You say that

    22           about a third of the cardholders of your library are minors?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you also say that you have no

    25           limitations in the library, those who actually go to the

                                                                           111

     1           library physically, that anyone of whatever age can go

     2           anywhere?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There is no restrictions based on

     5           age?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Many libraries have different library

     7           cards, one type of card for a minor and other for adults, we

     8           do not do that and many libraries do not.  In a way it's very

     9           deliberately -- taking a look at society as it evolves and as

    10           it changes, on the one hand there's a great need for easy-to-

    11           read material on the part of adults and so, in order to

    12           promote access to that material for adults, many libraries,

    13           particularly in branch libraries in urban areas are

    14           interfiling adult and juvenile material together, so that

    15           there is no stigma attached to the adult who wants to get

    16           some easy-to-read information.  Conversely, the same thing

    17           happens in the sense that many children are far more mature

    18           in their reading levels than in the past and we openly

    19           provide access to anything that that child wants.  We feel

    20           very strongly that it's the parent's decision on what reading

    21           level is available for a child.  So, if a child comes into

    22           our library and wants to take out a seven-million-page legal

    23           text that even adults can't understand, if that child -- we

    24           certainly will try to steer that child to something far more

    25           appropriate, but if that's not successful, if the child says

                                                                           112

     1           that's what he or she wants we certainly would give it to

     2           them, yes.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And you say in Paragraph 16,

     4           you list, shall we say, some colorful titles, and at the end

     5           you say in the carryover from Page 6 to 7 that these are

     6           popular titles in our collection, how do you know?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we certainly can electronically

     8           just know how many times a particular book is checked out or

     9           how many times a CD is checked out; we don't know who has

    10           checked that out, but we know --

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, okay.  So, these -- for

    12           example, these music titles, these are each CD's?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that's -- you're just keeping

    15           track that way?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you know the next

    18           sentence, "In fact the book by Ice T and the rap music CD's

    19           are particular popular with teenagers," how do you know that?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there are two methods I guess,

    21           one is the popularity in terms of waiting lists.  When we

    22           don't have enough copies of material people sign up on a

    23           reserve kind of basis and they're waiting to know.  It's

    24           simply our experience -- those particular books or that

    25           particular book was written with teenagers in mind and it has

                                                                           113

     1           a great deal to do with race relations in inner city areas

     2           and it's a popular item among teenagers.  We have some staff

     3           particularly at the main library who are called young adult

     4           librarians and it's their task specifically to relate both in

     5           terms of programs and collections to that population.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  And Paragraph 18,

     7           talking about contemporary community standards, which Ms.

     8           Russotto was getting at with you.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You say, "I have no clear

    11           understanding of what materials would be considered indecent

    12           or patently offensive for minors by some communities."  Isn't

    13           the only community you have to worry about the Three Rivers

    14           area?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't think so for a couple of

    16           reasons.  In the first place, the -- we know that a city like

    17           PIttsburgh -- well, that Pittsburgh has many different

    18           communities within it, ethnic groups that have lived in a

    19           particular neighborhood, third and fourth generations in the

    20           same homes, we know that there's stability about those ethnic

    21           neighborhoods.  We know that there are many different levels

    22           of communities within the public housing communities, for

    23           instance, in Pittsburgh.  We know that there are religious

    24           organizations and religious groups who have one level of

    25           standard which is terribly, terribly different from another

                                                                           114

     1           level of standard which also might be religious.  So, when we

     2           talk about community standards, we serve communities.  But

     3           even more so with the electronic information, and this is

     4           precisely why I'm concerned about this Act, because our

     5           material is now simply available around the world at any

     6           time, both the on-line journals, the RIM study, the kinds of

     7           projects that we're putting on line, like the early

     8           photographs of Pittsburgh we're putting all on line linking

     9           them with text, historic text, and then we're even adding

    10           audio tapes, we're adding oral history tapes into that

    11           segment, so that an old-time resident talks about the way a

    12           neighborhood has changed over that period of time.  Now,

    13           that's material that we're producing ourselves, so that we

    14           become an on-line provider, a content provider, a distributor

    15           and all of those kinds of things, that's happening more and

    16           more with libraries.  And the kinds of things that we have in

    17           our collections that we're making available to the world's

    18           population, we for instance have that one exhibit I think

    19           that we have about the RIM study, we have the number of

    20           specific domains that have contacted that study over a

    21           certain period of time.  So, it's not just our community or

    22           the local folks.  For whatever reason, this Act specifically

    23           says that -- libraries are mentioned in it as content

    24           providers or as information providers and that gives me great

    25           pause, because our collections are now available worldwide.

                                                                           115

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Two other -- two last questions. 

     2           First of all, you are active, I surmise from your vitae, in

     3           the American Library Association?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are you in a position to answer this

     6           question, therefore:  Is the use of on-line card catalogues

     7           superseding the hard copy that I grew up with and --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Right, me too.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- I suspect you grew up with --

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- is that the trend in public

    12           libraries?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, indeed, it is.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is it also a trend in public

    15           libraries that where you have no copyright problems, e.g.

    16           plays of Shakespeare, are those going full text on line in

    17           libraries?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, they're on -- what was happening

    19           is that there are providers on the Internet putting specific

    20           titles like the works of Shakespeare on, so that not every

    21           library does that individually, so that we all link

    22           immediately to those kinds of things, those texts, and we all

    23           can share them and all have them.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, you can hyperlink to that?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

                                                                           116

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  My question, Mr. Croneberger, is,

     3           as I understand your 18-page declaration, the two problems

     4           you have with the Act -- and maybe you have more than that,

     5           but two of them are that first of all it's technically

     6           impossible to comply with it and, even if it were technically

     7           possible, it would be financially impossible to comply with

     8           it; and, secondly, the definitions are simply impossible, I

     9           mean, you just can't ascertain what patently offensive and

    10           indecent mean.  If you had all the money that you needed and

    11           had -- that you wanted and if there were definitions of

    12           indecent and patently offensive could you devise a system

    13           that would prevent access to people under 18, given those 

    14           two -- 

    15                    THE WITNESS:  You mean provide --

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Could you provide a system that

    17           would prevent access for people under 18 of indecent and

    18           patently offensive material?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't think we could.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Because why?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Because our definition of what that

    22           might be -- I mean even --

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, no, no, no, I'm just --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, you've given me the definition.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- giving you a hypothesis, I

                                                                           117

     1           just want to know if it's possible given the --

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Given the world's --

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- I mean, given that you have

     4           all of the money you need and, secondly, given a definition

     5           that we all agreed upon, could you devise a system then that

     6           would prevent people under 18 from getting what we have

     7           defined and agreed upon as indecent and patently offensive

     8           material?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly I could not, because I'm not

    10           an expert of anything, but I think it could be done, but it

    11           certainly would contradict the mission of public libraries in

    12           the country.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Oh, I agree, I agree with you, I

    14           was just trying to find out whether you felt a system could

    15           be --

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, sure, I would think so.

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- it is possible to do that.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't mean you necessarily

    19           agree with him that -- well, on the bottom line?

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, right.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I wanted to make that clear,

    22           that still hasn't been decided.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, that hasn't been decided,

    24           absolutely.

    25                    (Laughter.)

                                                                           118

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I think part of our problem, if I may,

     2           with that is simply that we have parents who are very

     3           concerned about a child, a young child looking at a picture

     4           book which may show a dog urinating against a fire hydrant

     5           and to them that signifies the term indecent, or at the same

     6           time another picture book, a very famous one called 'Twas the

     7           Night Before Christmas, which at the end of the whole thing,

     8           when Santa has gone around the world and done all of the

     9           marvelous work he has done he is exhausted and takes a nip of

    10           brandy before he crawls into bed for a long sleep, and

    11           certainly we have parental objections to that sort of thing. 

    12           So that we're -- you know, we're concerned about a lot of

    13           different levels of stuff here.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me -- Judge Buckwalter tells me

    15           he's done, so I wanted to follow up, because that was my

    16           question also.  And you'll have to bear with me on this

    17           because I didn't expect to ask it, but late last night when I

    18           was working here and reading some of this material, in

    19           something that I read last night there was listed seven --

    20           and I can't remember now whether it was -- and I can't bring

    21           it up, so -- on the computer quickly, it was seven categories

    22           of material and what I can't remember is whether this

    23           material was the kind of thing that groups like Surf Watch

    24           would get out or whether it came up in some other category,

    25           but one of them was alcoholism and it dealt with where -- and

                                                                           119

     1           it made it -- it was kind of where you could get that.  And

     2           at the same time it just happened to come to my mind that

     3           what would Ray Milland and "The Lost Weekend" be, would you

     4           feel that if that -- would you -- as a librarian feel that a

     5           movie like that would then have to be removed from

     6           availability to people under 18?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I think that's one of my primary

     8           concerns, because we don't know, we would certainly be afraid

     9           so.  We would be afraid that the parameters of the

    10           terminology that might be searched if we're going into slang,

    11           if we're going into who knows, foreign languages, if we're

    12           going into visual images, our concern I think that library

    13           feels and feel pretty strongly is that there is a great deal

    14           of information that's terribly valuable.  If for instance we

    15           removed everything under the word sex we miss all of the sex-

    16           education material that's terribly important that teenagers

    17           have access to, because that's who it was written for, or

    18           that kind of material.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But going back to my question, on

    20           the other hand there are materials -- well, are there

    21           materials that deal with excessive alcoholism which you think

    22           would be pretty clearly on the other side of the line like,

    23           for example, "Leaving Las Vegas," or maybe you don't think

    24           that that is on that side of the line?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  I guess I don't -- the librarian part

                                                                           120

     1           of me doesn't want that line to exist, you see, because I

     2           think that it's a parental decision.  I certainly know what

     3           affects my 11-year-old and I know how to steer him, but I

     4           think that if we as libraries are put in the position of

     5           having to make those decisions for other people's children we

     6           will fail miserably, we will not do well.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And if you were -- or felt obliged

     8           to use something like Surf Watch or another group or

     9           mechanism like that to exclude from availability to children

    10           under 18 books or material that had, I think she said, the

    11           hundred -- the list of hundred words, would that exclude much

    12           of Shakespeare or some of Shakespeare?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  And the Bible and on and on, I think. 

    14           Public libraries would love to have net-blocker software

    15           available, so that we could loan them to parents free of

    16           charge and have the parental responsibilities there.  It's

    17           something that we do not think we can do, physically do or

    18           legally do or technically do, inside a library.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But as an expert you agree that

    20           net-blockers are available?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, absolutely, and --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And feasible?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  And a wonderful parental-supervise

    24           tool, absolutely.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I understand.  Thank you. 

                                                                           121

     1           Did that evoke any more questions, any of ours?

     2                    MS. KAPPLER:  No, your Honor.

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  

     5                    (Witness excused.)

     6                    (Discussion held off the record.)
