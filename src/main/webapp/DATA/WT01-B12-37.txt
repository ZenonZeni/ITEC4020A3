 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTEIN ASSURANCE </H2>

<P> PRO-MAX 100 is a highly nutritious supplement intended to provide the daily requirements for protein. Because of its high quality protein, it is particularly suitable for use by athletes and others with high protein requirements.  It is also suitable as a meal replacement  for individuals on calorie restricted diets, although <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> is usually used for this purpose. On the other hand, PRO-MAX 100 is usually preferred as the supplement of choice for fortifying foods and drinks by persons who want to ensure they are getting plenty of protein in their diet. It is great to use for low fat diets as well because PRO-MAX 100 is virtually fat free and easily digested.  Both of these products are excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of children and for the elderly as it is easily digested.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX 100 IS SPECIAL</H2>
<P> Life Plus developed <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> and PRO-MAX 100 to represent state-of-the-art in protein supplements. We chose not to use any soy, milk or hydrolyzed protein.  We were able to identify an excellent source of high quality vegetable protein, extracted for us from certain yellow peas under carefully controlled and monitored conditions. It contains a high percentage of essential amino acids.</P>
<P>  All proteins are not created equal. Different proteins contain various amounts of essential amino acids. Essential Amino Acids are those that the body cannot manufacture itself, so they must be contained in the diet. PRO-MAX 100, with its high percentage of essential amino acids, is a leading product in its category. The P.E.R or Protein Efficiency Ratio is a number that describes the quality of proteins. PRO-MAX 100 has a very high P.E.R. of 2.7. PRO-MAX 100 could supply the body's entire need for protein if enough were taken.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX 100 is very palatable. It has a pleasant, somewhat bland flavor superior to other protein powders. <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO- MAX</A> and PRO-MAX 100 are the two finest and most versatile protein supplements in both palatability and composition.    They are useful for lasting energy and for building energy reserves for people of all ages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?</H2>
<P> The only difference between <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> and PRO-MAX 100 is that PRO-MAX 100 does not contain the complex carbohydrates and fiber that are present in <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A>. PRO-MAX 100 contains 100% protein whereas <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> contains 70% protein and 30% complex carbohydrate. Any given amount of PRO-MAX 100 contains 1.43 times the amount of protein than <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A>. PRO-MAX 100 is for those individuals who, for one reason or another, wish to obtain their carbohydrate from other sources. While <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> is more nutritionally complete, carbohydrate-sensitive individuals may prefer PRO-MAX 100.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX  100  is  formulated  in  the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phyto nutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE PRO-MAX 100</H2>
</P>  PRO-MAX 100 is intended to be used in the form of a drink and as an ingredient added to recipes. It can be added to flour used in baked goods such as breads and cookies.  It can also be added to dips, soups, sauces and gravies. For those wishing to gain weight, we recommend that it be taken in the form of a shake at meal times in addition to your regular food. In the case of athletes, take in water or juice approximately one hour before exercise. Many people claim both <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX </A> and PRO-MAX 100 are great to control appetite and help maintain energy levels throughout the whole day.</P>


<P>Suggested Use: Mix two to four heaping tablespoonfuls in liquid as a high enregy quality protein drink between meals and/or before or after exercise or as a meal replacement.</P>
