<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>What is Total Return?</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Total return is a way for investors to keep score of their investments
</STRONG><BR>
For sports enthusiasts, there's nothing quite like the anticipation at the start of a new
baseball season. 
How will your favorite team do?  Will they aim for a high average or hit lots of home runs? 
Will it be a
good season or a frustrating one?  What are the chances of winning the pennant?
<P>
Once the season starts, many people keep track of each game's score and their team's
place in the
standings.  And, like your team, your investments can perform well one year and disappoint
you the
next.  Or, your team could be a model of consistency, contending for the pennant year after
year, with
only a few exceptions.
<P>

<STRONG>Keep score of your fund's performance with total returns</STRONG><BR>
If you're a mutual fund investor, total return is the full amount your investment earns over a
specific
period of time.  This takes into account all three ways you may earn or lose money with mutual
funds:
dividends, income, capital gains distributions, and capital appreciation (an increase or decrease in net asset
value or NAV).
<P>
Investors should be as concerned with what goes into total return as with the bottom line. 
They should know whether their investment has come out ahead and, if so, by how much.  There are
many reasons why you should pay close attention to each part of the total return you
receive.  They are
reasons like these:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
<STRONG>Your purpose for investing</STRONG> - If you're investing to maximize income,
dividends
will be very important to you.  If you're looking for long-term growth, you're going to be
interested in
capital appreciation.
<P><STRONG>The style that makes you most comfortable</STRONG> - If you love home runs
and aren't
afraid of strikeouts, you'll probably look for funds that focus on the potential for capital
appreciation, even if
they have
more ups and downs than other funds.  If you like hitting for a high average and always
being on base,
you may prefer a fund with the potential for regular dividends and less volatility.

</DL>
<P>

<STRONG>A Valuable Tool</STRONG><BR>
Total returns can be a valuable tool in selecting funds when viewed in light of your
objectives, time
horizon, and attitudes about risk and reward. Remember, though, that past performance is not a
guarantee of future results.
<P>
Your Registered Representative is one of your best resources for determining how performance
should affect
your overall investment strategy.
<P>
When providing performance information, all funds must disclose that past performance is
no
guarantee of future results and that share prices will fluctuate, so that, when redeemed,
shares may be
worth more or less than their original cost.
