<H2>Should I Design My Own Pre-Employment Testing Program?</H2><P>Designing a testing program for employee selection can be an interesting task. Some basic information about testing and a great deal of information about the specific job you wish to hire an employee to do is required. If you have this knowledge, then you may be the best person to develop your own testing program. We may be able to help, once you have identified some basic objectives for your program, by suggesting commonly used tests which will rank individuals based on the objectives you have identified. There is no charge for this type of consultation.<P>
If you do not feel comfortable with your knowledge of standardized assessment, or feel that you need some hand-holding until you are comfortable with assessment procedures, we may be able to consult with you for a fee or refer you to another consultant who will be able to assist you. We work closely with several very good independent professionals who have a full-time practice in program evaluation or in pre-employment evaluation.<P> <H2>What services do we offer?</H2>
<H3>A source of commercially published standardized tests</H3>
<P><P>We offer a one-stop source from which to purchase the testing materials of over one hundred different publishers. Our remuneration comes from the sale of tests. There is no charge for telephone/fax/email consultation about tests.
<H3>Test consultation via phone/fax/email</H3>
<P>As with other technical publications (like computer software), often purchasers face many competing products that will do the same job. Some are better than others, some are adequate but much more expensive than competing products of roughly the same quality. A knowledgable test consultant can make the job, of deciding which tests to use, manageable.<P>We consult with professionals as to which tests may be appropriate for their use. Our test consultants are familiar with most of the titles which we list in our catalog. If you want to know about a current test which is in general use, it is likely that the test consultant will be able to help immediately from his/her own knowledge. In addition, test consultants have access to sources of reference information which may only be available to you if you were to go to a university library. 
<H3>Testing program development</H3>
<P>Businesses that want a professionally developed testing program, for pre-employment evaluation or for any other purpose, can obtain more in depth advice by hiring a consultant from our firm or by asking us for a referral to another qualified professional.<P>A test consultant can be expected to visit your site and devise an assessment system for program evaluation, employee evaluation, pre-employment selection, etc. Evaluation systems developed by our consultants will include...<UL><LI src=bullet.gif>a written report in the form of a program manual</LI><LI src=bullet.gif>training so that your personnel will be able to operate the program independently</LI><LI src=bullet.gif>security, in that a consultant who is knowledgable about your situation and your evaluation system will always be available to assist you should any questions arise. Moreover, knowledge of your selection procedure will not be lost to your firm when a key employee leaves -- because we will have your testing program on file.</LI></UL>Typically, fees for this type of consulting service are billed at an hourly rate of $125/hour or $900/day (Canadian dollars), plus expenses.
<P>If, due to time constraints, we cannot help as immediately as you would like, we will refer you to another competent professional or to a professional association that may have an experienced member practicing in your region.
<H3>What we do not offer.</H3>
<p>Certain (few) tests are <A HREF="WhatAreR.html">restricted</A>. We do not provide restricted tests to people who are not qualified
 to obtain them.<P>
With reference to designing a testing program and training people to use tests -- it is not possible to provide the same quality of service over the phone as a consultant can provide in person. If we feel that a consultant must visit your site and that you will need training about how tests work, what test objectives are, etc. -- we will quote a price for designing a program, and/or we will refer you to another appropriate source of assistance. For more information please see the articles <A HREF="WhatAreS.html">What Are Standardized Tests</A> and <A HREF="WhatAreR.html">What are Restricted Tests</A>.<P><CENTER>
