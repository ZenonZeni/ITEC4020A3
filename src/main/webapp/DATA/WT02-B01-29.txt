through before one can evaluate                                          
the ramifications of their                                               
proposals. This is the great                                             
weakness of the prolegalization                                          
position. Participants in the                                            
Forum suggested that the following                                       
questions be asked consistently in                                       
order to illustrate the                                                  
shallowness of the legalization                                          
concept.                                                                 

Should all drugs be legalized ?     The question is not whether any      
                                    drugs should be &quot;legalized&quot; because  
                                    the DEA itself states further down   
                                    in this book that there is no real   
                                    definition of &quot;legalization.&quot;  Is    
                                    alcohol legal?  In some senses it    
                                    is, and in others it is not.  The    
                                    same is true of many other drugs.    
                                    If the DEA is right, we will never   
                                    &quot;legalize&quot; any of these drugs, so    
                                    they miss the point to focus on      
                                    &quot;legalization.&quot;                      
                                                                         
                                    The real question is prison.  Right  
                                    now we are embarked on a course      
                                    which will incarcerate millions of   
                                    people who, in the view of many of   
                                    the prison wardens in this country,  
                                    don't need to be in prison.  We are  
                                    turning loose violent felons so we   
                                    can incarcerate more drug users.     
                                    With these laws, we have the         
                                    opportunity to imprison literally    
                                    millions of people.  We must decide  
                                    how many millions of people we are   
                                    going to put in prison to make this  
                                    policy work.                         
                                                                         
                                    As a personal matter, I don't much   
                                    like cigars.  I think they are       
                                    addictive, dangerous, smelly, and    
                                    disgusting. I cannot understand why  
                                    anyone would want to walk around     
                                    with one of those things stuck in    
                                    their face,  and I make my feelings  
                                    known to anyone who lights one up    
                                    in my presence.  At the same time,   
                                    I don't want to put George Burns in  
                                    prison.                              
                                                                         
                                    No matter what policy we may         
                                    devise, or what name we may call     
                                    it, it is an undeniable truth that   
                                    putting people in prison does no     
                                    good at all.                         

Who will determine which segments   Who determines the access to drugs   
of the population will have access  now?                                 
to legalized drugs?                 Under &quot;legalization&quot; it would be     
                                    the same people who do it for        
                                    alcohol and tobacco.                 

Will they be limited only to        Are they limited to people over      
people over eighteen ?              eighteen now?                        
                                                                         
                                    Every major proposal for reform      
                                    assumes that minors should not have  
                                    access to drugs.  This is one of     
                                    the major reasons that many people   
                                    would like to see reform, because a  
                                    more sensible policy would do a      
                                    better job of keeping drugs away     
                                    from children.                       

Will cocaine, heroin, LSD and PCP   Are they available now?  As the DEA  
be made available if people         itself admits, their efforts have    
request them?                       never had any major effect on        
                                    availability of drugs and it is      
                                    unlikely that they ever will affect  
                                    the drug market.                     

Who will sell drugs? The            Who sells them now?                  
Government? Private companies ?     You can't think of anyone who could  
                                    do a better job than the current     
                                    sellers?                             

And who is liable for damages       The rules for liability should be    
caused by drug use and the          consistent for all drugs.  If you    
activities of those taking drugs?   get hit by a drunk or stoned         
                                    driver, it doesn't matter to you     
                                    which chemical caused the problem.   
                                    The damage is done in either case,   
                                    and should be addressed the same     
                                    under law.                           

Who will collect the revenues       Who collects them now?               
generated by the drug sales?        We have funded the richest criminal  
                                    organizations in the history of the  
                                    world with this policy. It is time   
                                    to take the money out of their       
                                    hands with a more sensible policy.   

How will a black market for         The same way it is controlled for    
cheaper drugs be controlled ?       alcohol and tobacco.                 

Who will bear the costs to society  Under the current system the         
of increased drug use?              taxpayers bear the entire cost, and  
                                    this system uses the single most     
                                    expensive, least cost-effective      
                                    approach to the problem -- prison.   
                                    For the same money it takes to       
                                    catch, try, and convict one drug     
                                    offender and to hold them in prison  
                                    for five years, we can provide       
                                    treatment or education for more      
                                    than one hundred people.  Which do   
                                    you think is the better deal?        

How will absenteeism and loss of    It should be addressed the same way  
productivity be  addressed by       it is for alcohol, tobacco, or any   
business?                           similar problem.                     

Will the local drug situation in a  Who dictates where drugs are sold    
community dictate which drugs are   now?                                 
sold where?                         The community itself should dictate  
                                    these matters, as they do with       
                                    liquor and tobacco outlets.          

How will society care for and pay   First, there is no real evidence     
for the attendant social costs of   that drug use would increase under   
increased drug use, including       a more sensible policy.              
family disintegration and child     Society is paying these costs        
neglect?                            already.  Reform would seek to       
                                    reduce those costs by using          
                                    approaches which are more            
                                    cost-effective than prison.  Prison  
                                    does not do anything to address      
                                    these problems.                      

Will people still need              This is a separate issue and,        
prescriptions for currently         whichever way it goes, will not      
controlled medications, such as     make much difference to the          
antibiotics, if drugs are           fundamental problems of our current  
legalized ?                         drug policy.  Antibiotics are an     
                                    entirely different class of drug     
                                    with an entirely different set of    
                                    uses and associated problems.        
                                    Therefore, it would be appropriate   
                                    to have a different policy for       
                                    them.                                

Will legal drugs require            That depends on what you mean by     
prescriptions?                      &quot;legal&quot;.  For example, both alcohol  
                                    and penicillin are &quot;legal&quot; but have  
                                    different requirements for           
                                    purchasing them.                     

Can anyone, regardless of physical  Who can purchase them now?           
or medical conditions purchase                                           
drugs?                              Can anyone, regardless of physical   
                                    or medical conditions purchase       
                                    alcohol or tobacco?  Alcohol and     
                                    tobacco are the big killers by a     
                                    wide margin. If we can manage to     
                                    find a workable policy for alcohol   
                                    and tobacco, then the other drugs    
                                    will be easy.                        

How can we deal with the influx of  We won't have to.  The rest of the   
people to the United States who     western world is going toward        
are seeking legal drugs?            &quot;legalization&quot; faster than we are.   

Can we begin a legalization pilot   Yes.  As the New York City Bar       
program in your neighborhood for    Association recommended, we should   
one year?                           allow states and communities to      
                                    determine their own approach to the  
                                    problem, as they do for alcohol, so  
                                    that we might have a number of       
                                    different programs from which to     
                                    draw ideas and information.  The     
                                    one thing we should not do is to     
                                    stay locked in to a single national  
                                    policy which -- by definition --     
                                    cannot work.                         

Should the distribution outlets be  Where are the distribution outlets   
located in the already              located now?                         
overburdened inner city?                                                 
                                    Matters affecting the inner city     
                                    should be decided by the people in   
                                    the inner city.
