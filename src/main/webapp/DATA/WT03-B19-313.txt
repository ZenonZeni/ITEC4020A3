<P>
The CRC was established in 1992 to provide strategic and applied research and postgraduate education in sensor signal and information processing with the aim of providing tangible benefits for Australia.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre has about 150 part-time and full-time staff, including research fellows and postgraduate students. It brings together world-class researchers in five Australian universities with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Telstra, and Digital Equipment Corporation (Australia). The centre performs basic and applied research in radar, visual and image processing, multi-sensor fusion, and information processing.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Examples of recent commercial research contracts include: improvements to the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar network, medical image classification for pap smear tests, ground-penetration radar for coal mining, and recognition algorithms for maritime surveillance.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The University of Melbourne is a partner in the centre. The Information Processing group in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering is well known for its work in tracking and signal processing.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The centre has 57 postgraduate students of whom 15 are enrolled at the University of Melbourne. Twelve postgraduate courses a year in various areas of signal processing are offered.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The centre has targeted three main industry sectors in which to commercialise its R&D - defence, medical and mining. Additionally, the centre seeks to commercialise its R&D in the general electronics sector by adding value to existing products via signal and information-processing techniques.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Centre resources amount to about $8 million per annum, comprising $6 million in cash, staff, equipment and facilities contributed by the parties, and $2 million from the Australian Government.
