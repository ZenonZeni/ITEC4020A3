frowned upon as it might offend certain groups (like fat
people or women). Also I do not like the emphasis on
collaborative research. Both these trends kill the creative
freedom of the individual. You just have to go ahead and
find things out for yourself. This is the mark of a good
scientist."<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>

The room is dimly lit, quiet and small. It's in the big
modern psychology building at the University of Western
Ontario. A young university student sits at a table ready
for the test. There are no windows. The ventilation system
is the only sound. A slightly older graduate student
administers the test from the other side of the table. She places a
sheet of paper with rows and rows of little pictures in
front of the subject and starts a stopwatch. The fellow
taking the test is getting $10 dollars to sit for a half
hour checking off pictures that match. As soon as he
finishes one page, she puts another one in front of him
until two minutes are up. It's kind of fun at first but it
gets a little bit boring after a while; especially for the
older student who has given this test almost a hundred times
already. The stopwatch sets the pace of the action in two
minute intervals as different subjects come into the room to
do the test. Later, the graduate student tabulates the
results to see how many rows of pictures men matched
correctly compared to how many rows the women got right.
Doreen Kimura comes in and takes a look at the raw data.
Right away she can see they are onto something and a subtle
smile crosses her face.<P>


<B>History</B>:<BR>
Kimura grew up and went to school in a small town in
Saskatchewan (Neudorf, near Yorkton), where facilities to do
science were almost non-existent; so her interests were in
writing, languages, and algebra. Before finishing High
School, at the age of 17 Kimura dropped out to teach in one-
roomed rural schoolhouses in Saskatchewan and Northern
Manitoba. While in Manitoba she saw an ad in a teacher's
magazine for an admission scholarship to McGill, applied for
the fun of it, and got it!<P>

At McGill she became interested in <A HREF="http://www.valdosta.peachnet.edu/~whuitt/psyc.html">Psychology</A> as a result of
hearing <A HREF=http://fas.sfu.ca/css/gcs/scientists/more-scientists.html#Hebb>Donald O. Hebb</A>
lecture in the introductory course. She got a BA, MA and PhD
at McGill, the latter in Psycho-biology, and then spent two
years as a post-doctoral Fellow at the Montreal Neurological
Institute, before sojourns at UCLA Medical Center and the
Zurich Kantonsspital in Switzerland. She became a professor
in Psychology  at UWO in 1967. She also has a small
consulting business which sells neuropsychological tests
that she developed.<P>

<HR>
Behavioural psychologists study how brains work to
understand how people differ from each other. They do this
by giving people psychological tests. For instance you might
be shown a series of pictures where you have to match the
ones that are the same. The test is timed and the faster you
do it the higher your score.<P>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/kimura_graphic.gif>
<P>
1. Mental Rotation Test: On average, men can pick out
matching rotated objects faster than women. Women are better
at matching objects based on their surroundings.<P>

2. Aphasias: Aphasias, or speech disorders, occur most often
in women when they have brain damage in the front of the
brain. In men, these disorders occur when the damage is in
the back of the brain.<P>

3. Finger Ridge Counts: Kimura counts the number of finger
ridges between two specific points on a person's fingerprint. People
with high ridge counts on the left hand are better at
"feminine" tasks. On average any sample group of people will have
more ridges on their right hands. But Kimura has found that
on average, sample groups of women and groups of homosexual men have
a higher incidence of individuals with more ridges on
their left hands. <P>


<B>Activity</B>:<BR>

Find someone you can watch for five minutes while they are
talking. They don't need to be talking to you. They could be
in a restaurant or a bus or they could be talking to someone
else with you. They should have nothing in their hands. The
idea is to record their hand movements while they talk for
five minutes.<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/kimura_table.gif hspace=10><BR>
Make a table to record your data. The table
has three columns: one for right and one for left hands, and
one for both hands. It also has two rows so you can record
self-touching movements as well as free movements.<BR CLEAR=ALL><P>

After doing several different people, count up the totals of hand
movements for each individual. Did you record more right hand movements
or left hand movements? While people are talking they use speech centres
on the left side of the brain. Which side of the brain controls the movements
of the right hand? Your experiment might help answer this question. If you
pool your observations with dozens of others at your school you may have 
enough data
to calculate a left and right hand movement average for men and an
average for women. Which sex uses their right hand the most while they are
talking?<P>

<B>Mystery</B>:<BR>
Kimura offered no mystery for future generations to solve,
saying that it's the unpredictability of science that makes
it interesting.<P>
