United Contractors of Kinston, Inc.
462 S.E.2d 816 (N.C.App. 1995)

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING ATTORNEY'S FEES

Hunzinger Construction Co. v.  *
Granite Resources Corp.
538 N.W.2d 804 (Wis.App. 1995)
A contractor suffered loss of productivity as a result of a supplier's

supplier did not expressly authorize recovery of attorney fees.

Simpson Contracting Corp., Appeal of  *

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING BIDS -- MISTAKES

Bay Pacific Pipelines, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-265659 (December 18, 1995)
Although the invitation for bids stated that unit prices would govern
over extended prices, it was apparent, based on the government's
estimate and other bid prices, that the bidder had inadvertently added a
zero to its unit price. The procuring agency properly allowed correction
of the bid and displacement of the apparent low bidder, because the
agency may compare prices when determining the bidder's intent as
reflected on the face of the bid itself.

Colonnelli Brothers, Inc. v.  *
Village of Ridgefield Park
665 A.2d 1136 (N.J.Super.A.D. 1995)
A bid should have been corrected to become the low bid because the
solicitation stated that in the event of a discrepancy between unit
prices and extended totals, the unit prices would govern.

Herb Richards Construction Co., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-262177 (November 20, 1995)
An agency determination that a bidder was affiliated with a debarred
individual and therefore ineligible for award was reasonable. The
individual in question signed the bid in his capacity as project
manager.

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING BIDS -- RESPONSIVENESS

Adler Construction, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-261506.2 (November 7, 1995)
Language in bid made it unclear whether the bidder intended to provide
an ozone treatment system in accordance with the specifications. A post-
bid opening explanation was not permissible. The bid was nonresponsive.

DIT-MCO International, Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-261976 (October 31, 1995)
An agency's rejection of a proposed product under a "brand name or
equal" specification was improper. The features that were allegedly
missing were not identified as salient characteristics in the
specifications. The bid was therefore responsive.

Harvest Construction Co., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-267513 (November 16, 1995)
A commercial bid bond form which extinguished the surety's liability if
the bidder paid the costs of its default was deficient. The federal
regulations require the surety to pay all costs up to the penal amount
of the bid bond. The bid was nonresponsive.

Kelton Contracting, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-262255 (December 12, 1995)
A hand-carried bid was received by agency personnel prior to the
designated time set for bid opening. The agency mishandled the bid. The
bid was responsive.

Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261603 (October 11, 1995)
Although a low bid may have been mathematically unbalanced, there was no
evidence of enhanced prices. The bid was not materially unbalanced and
was therefore responsive.

Robinson & Company, Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-265656 (December 1, 1995)
The failure to acknowledge an amendment to the bid solicitation which
affected Davis-Bacon wage rates rendered the bid nonresponsive.

Shackelford Mechanical, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-261948 (November 1, 1995)
A bid bond was defective because the surety's certification that the
agent's power of attorney had not been revoked was undated. The bid was
therefore nonresponsive.

Tec Electric, Inc. v.  *
Franklin Lakes Board of Education
665 A.2d 803 (N.J.Super.L. 1995)
The omission of a prequalification affidavit with a bid was an
immaterial defect. It was an abuse of discretion for the public project
owner to refuse to waive the irregularity.

PI Construction Corp., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-270576.2 (December 15, 1995)
A contracting officer properly deleted small disadvantaged set-aside
provisions from an invitation for bids, based upon a government
suspension of the applicable regulation.

Robinson & Company, Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-265656 (December 1, 1995)
The failure to acknowledge an amendment to the bid solicitation which
affected Davis-Bacon wage rates rendered the bid nonresponsive.

Seven West 34th Street Development Corp.
632 N.Y.S.2d 3 (N.Y.A.D. 1995)
A prime contractor could assert the lack of timely notice as a defense
to a subcontractor's action against a payment bond even though the
contractor did not respond to the sub's inquiries regarding the
existence of a bond. There was no misrepresentation.

Building Profit Corp. v. Mortgage and Realty Trust  *
42 Cal.Rptr.2d 533 (Cal.App. 1995)
A construction lender was required to withhold payments after being
served with a bonded stop notice, even though the contractor had not
recorded a payment bond.

William R. Clarke Corp. v. Safeco Insurance Co.  *
46 Cal.Rptr.2d 183 (Cal.App. 1995)
Where a subcontractor expressly reserved its mechanic's lien rights, the
sub could recover against the payment bond despite a "pay-if-paid"
clause in the subcontract.

Palm Beach County v. Trinity Industries, Inc.  *
661 So.2d 942 (Fla.App. 1995)
When the estimated value of an indefinite quantity construction contract
exceeded the statutory threshold, the public project owner owed a duty
to subcontractors to assure that the prime contractor furnished a valid
payment bond.

In re Liquidation of  *
Union Indemnity Insurance Co. of New York
632 N.Y.S.2d 788 (N.Y.A.D. 1995)
A nonconsenting surety was released from its payment bond obligation by

William R. Clarke Corp. v. Safeco Insurance Co.
46 Cal.Rptr.2d 183 (Cal.App. 1995)

American National Bank of Chicago
656 N.E.2d 157 (Ill.App. 1995)
A subcontract clause stating that the subcontractor would be paid

superseded a "pay-if-paid" clause in the subcontract. The sub was
entitled to payment regardless of nonpayment by the owner to the prime
due to the owner's insolvency.

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING DAMAGES

County Asphalt Paving Co., Inc. v.  *
1861 Group, Ltd.
908 S.W.2d 184 (Mo.App. 1995)
A project owner's damages for a paving contractor's deficient
performance were the cost of repair, not the diminution in fair market
value, because repair did not entail economic waste.

Cramer Alaska, Inc., Appeal of  *
ASBCA No. 47725 (October 11, 1995)
Although the government did not return leased equipment at the
stipulated time, the contractor's damage claim was too speculative.

Tully Construction Co., Inc. v. United Minerals, Inc.
633 N.Y.S.2d 91 (N.Y.A.D. 1995)
The award of attorney fees and other costs is available to a project

Otherwise, the only appropriate remedy is to vacate the lien.

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING DELAY -- NONEXCUSABLE

ACC Alderman Construction Co., Appeal of  *
ASBCA No. 43958 (November 9, 1995)
The per diem liquidated damages amount was a reasonable forecast of the
actual damages the government would incur as a result of lack of use of
the facility. The provision was not an unenforceable penalty and there
was no excusable delay. The contractor was liable for damages from the
contractual completion deadline until the date the government took
beneficial use and occupancy of the building.

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING ESTIMATES

Bay Pacific Pipelines, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-265659 (December 18, 1995)
Although the invitation for bids stated that unit prices would govern
over extended prices, it was apparent, based on the government's
estimate and other bid prices, that the bidder had inadvertently added a
zero to its unit price. The procuring agency properly allowed correction
of the bid and displacement of the apparent low bidder, because the
agency may compare prices when determining the bidder's intent as
reflected on the face of the bid itself.

An agency's rejection of a proposed product under a "brand name or

missing were not identified as salient characteristics in the
specifications. The bid was therefore responsive.

prices and extended totals, the unit prices would govern.
For Colonnelli: Thomas Cosma, Roseland, N.J.
For the Village: Phillip Boggia, Ridgefield Park, N.J.

DECEMBER CASES SETTLED BY THE ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS

ACC Alderman Construction Co., Appeal of
ASBCA No. 43958 (November 9, 1995)
The per diem liquidated damages amount was a reasonable forecast of the
actual damages the government would incur as a result of lack of use of
the facility. The provision was not an unenforceable penalty and there
was no excusable delay. The contractor was liable for damages from the
contractual completion deadline until the date the government took
beneficial use and occupancy of the building.
For ACC: Arthur Vega, San Antonio, Tex.
For the government: Thomas Marcey, Washington, D.C.

Cramer Alaska, Inc., Appeal of
ASBCA No. 47725 (October 11, 1995)
Although the government did not return leased equipment at the
stipulated time, the contractor's damage claim was too speculative.
For Cramer: Richard Haggert, Anchorage, Alaska.
For the government: Michael Hoover, Washington, D.C.

DECEMBER CASES SETTLED BY THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL

Adler Construction, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261506.2 (November 7, 1995)
Language in bid made it unclear whether the bidder intended to provide
an ozone treatment system in accordance with the specifications. A post-
bid opening explanation was not permissible. The bid was nonresponsive.
For Adler: Rosemary Hayes.
For the government: Christopher Kneib.

Bay Pacific Pipelines, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-265659 (December 18, 1995)
Although the invitation for bids stated that unit prices would govern
over extended prices, it was apparent, based on the government's
estimate and other bid prices, that the bidder had inadvertently added a
zero to its unit price. The procuring agency properly allowed correction
of the bid and displacement of the apparent low bidder, because the
agency may compare prices when determining the bidder's intent as
reflected on the face of the bid itself.
For Bay Pacific: Robert Sciaroni.
For the government: Lucie McDonald.

DIT-MCO International, Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261976 (October 31, 1995)
An agency's rejection of a proposed product under a "brand name or
equal" specification was improper. The features that were allegedly
missing were not identified as salient characteristics in the
specifications. The bid was therefore responsive.
For the government: Thomas Brown.

Harvest Construction Co., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-267513 (November 16, 1995)
A commercial bid bond form which extinguished the surety's liability if
the bidder paid the costs of its default was deficient. The federal
regulations require the surety to pay all costs up to the penal amount
of the bid bond. The bid was nonresponsive.
For Harvest: William Potter.
For the government: Allen Smith.

Kelton Contracting, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-262255 (December 12, 1995)
A hand-carried bid was received by agency personnel prior to the
designated time set for bid opening. The agency mishandled the bid. The
bid was responsive.
For the government: Emily Hewitt.

Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261603 (October 11, 1995)
Although a low bid may have been mathematically unbalanced, there was no
evidence of enhanced prices. The bid was not materially unbalanced and
was therefore responsive.
For the government: Lawrence Little.

PI Construction Corp., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-270576.2 (December 15, 1995)
A contracting officer properly deleted small disadvantaged set-aside
provisions from an invitation for bids, based upon a government
suspension of the applicable regulation.
For PI Construction: Paralee White.
For the government: Gregory Petkoff.

Herb Richards Construction Co., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-262177 (November 20, 1995)
An agency determination that a bidder was affiliated with a debarred
individual and therefore ineligible for award was reasonable. The
individual in question signed the bid in his capacity as project
manager.
For Richards: Dennis Lind.
For the government: Allen Smith.

Robinson & Company, Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-265656 (December 1, 1995)
The failure to acknowledge an amendment to the bid solicitation which
affected Davis-Bacon wage rates rendered the bid nonresponsive.
For the government: Amy Steed.

Shackelford Mechanical, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261948 (November 1, 1995)
A bid bond was defective because the surety's certification that the
agent's power of attorney had not been revoked was undated. The bid was
therefore nonresponsive.
For Shackelford: William Purdy.
For the government: Marilyn Johnson.

For Walk: Frank Walk, New Orleans, La.
For the government: Kevin Myles, Fort Worth, Tex.
