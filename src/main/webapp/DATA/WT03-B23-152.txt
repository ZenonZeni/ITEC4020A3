				Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by corporations and
				have many of the same features as other bonds. A corporate bond
				is a loan made by a corporation in return for a specified amount
				of interest and repayment of the face value of the bond at a specified
				maturity date. The interest (coupon) rate is generally fixed for
				the life of the bond and the face value (par) of the bond is usually
				$1,000. Since corporate bonds have a higher risk of default than
				Treasury and GSE securities, they generally have a higher coupon
				yield. A good-quality corporate bond could have a coupon rate
				of 1 to 1<FONT SIZE=1>1/2</FONT>%  more than a Treasury
				bond having the same maturity date. 
	<P>
				There are many types of corporate bonds that can be classified
				as either secured or unsecured. For secured bonds, the issuer
				pledges an asset such as a mortgage or a piece of equipment as
				collateral in the event of a default. Unsecured bonds or debentures,
				which are the most common form of corporate bonds, are backed
				only by the issuer's creditworthiness and its ability to pay annual
				interest and principal at maturity.  In the event of default, unsecured bondholders
				are paid after all other senior loan obligations, but before equity shareholders.
	<P>
				Generally, corporate bond investors are more concerned with the
				issuer's ability to pay or <I>risk of default</I> rather than
				with security alone. In the event of a default, pledged assets
				may not be marketable, and it may involve some time consuming
				litigation. To help evaluate the risk of default on individual
				bond issues, most investors rely on the ratings given by commercial
				rating companies such as Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch.
				Since financial conditions can change after the bond's initial
				rating has been set, it's important that investors regularly
				monitor the company's financial health. As with any other fixed-income
				investment, the greater the risk, the higher the coupon rate for
				the issue.
