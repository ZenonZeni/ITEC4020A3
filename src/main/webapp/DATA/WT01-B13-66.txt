<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois --</B> Kemper  Municipal Income
Trust declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996, of $0.0725
per common share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996. This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary: </B> Kemper Municipal Income Trust gained 1.10% in
net asset value, while slipping 0.42% in market value in October.
<P>
The municipal market was volatile in October as investors debated
the outcome of the congressional elections and whether or not
the Federal Reserve Board would tighten rates.<B> </B>Supply was
moderately heavy ($14.8 billion) and was met with relatively modest
demand. <I>The Bond Buyer</I> 25-Bond Revenue Index, began the
month at 6.01% (9/26/96), dropped to 5.95% (10/3/96), then fell to
5.94% (10/31/96). The municipal to Treasury yield ratio rose to
89% from 87% during the month. Portfolio Manager Chris Mier looks
for rates to remain stable with a bias to move lower.  He anticipates
moderate supply.
<P>

from Federal income taxes by investing in a diversified portfolio
of investment grade tax-exempt municipal securities.   Income
