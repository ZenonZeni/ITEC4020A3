<b>Development of a Clean, Premixed Burner for

Hydrogen Utilization<br>
Jay Keller, Principal Investigator,<br>

<a href="http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National 
Laboratories</b></center></a>

<P>

The objectives for this project are to develop an environmentally

benign and safe burner operating on hydrogen in a lean, fully

premixed mode and to provide a facility in which fundamental 
investigations

can be performed to support other DOE Hydrogen Utilization programs.

Three end-use sectors are addressed by this project: power generation

from stationary turbines; generation of process heat or steam;

and commercial and residential direct-use applications.

<P>

Eliminating carbon from the fuel will remove carbon-containing

species from the exhaust.  However, NO<sub>x</sub>-resulting from 
thermal

NO production cannot be ignored.  Thermal NO production is minimized

by reducing the peak combustion temperature and the residence

time at the peak temperature.  NO can be reduced to extremely low

levels (on the order of 5 ppm or less) by operating in a lean,

fully premixed mode to reduce the peak combustion temperature.

<P>

In premixed systems, a significant volume is required to ensure

thorough mixing of the fuel and oxidizer.  However, the danger

associated with flashback has limited the implementation of premixed

systems.  The lean premixed combustion project described here is

designed to systematically investigate the combustion fluid dynamic

characteristics necessary to provide a fully premixed system capable

of completely oxidizing hydrocarbon/hydrogen fuels in a safe,

environmentally benign manner.  Systems that exploit the mixing

characteristics of coherent vortical structures and the associated

large strain fields will be investigated.  The goal of this work

is to develop fluid dynamic mixing technologies so that combustion

occurs in a controlled, safe and fully premixed mode.

<P>

In this work, we capitalize on the fluid dynamic features necessary

to suppress the reaction (through controlling the fluid dynamic

strain rates); provide a controlled mixing environment to rapidly

mix reactants on a macroscopic scale (through controlling large-scale

coherent vortical structures); and provide a controlled mixing

environment to rapidly and thoroughly mix reactants on a microscopic

scale (through controlling the three-dimensional breakdown of

the large structures, and enhanced fine-scale velocity fluctuations

to promote thorough microscopic mixing).  Static and periodic methods

of controlling vorticity deposition rate and subsequent behavior

of the resulting large-scale coherent structure will be investigated.

Control over the rate and quality of the three-dimensional breakdown

of these coherent structures will be achieved through careful

deposition of additional components of vorticity, and by promoting

the natural breakdown of these large-scale structures by introducing

flow features that promote the natural breakdown phenomenon.  This

premixing technology will eliminate the dangerous volumes of premixed

gases associated with typical premixing techniques.

<P>

<b><i>Recent Advances: </i></b>

<P>

All appropriate laboratory modifications needed to satisfy required

ES&amp;H upgrades and for the insertion of the premixed burner

have been completed.  The initial burner concept consists of co-axial

axi-symmetric annular spaces with a stagnation plate to create

Kelvin-Helmholtz vortical elements followed by a roll-up toroidal

vortex element.  This geometry provides control over the 
Kelvin-Helmholtz

vortex strength as well as the ability to control the strength

and subsequent breakdown of the toroidal vortex.  This burner

has been designed, and construction should be completed soon.
