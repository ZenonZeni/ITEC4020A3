FEDERAL AID COULD LAUNCH PRIVATE BOOSTER INDUSTRY, STUDY SAYS

    Aggressive federal incentives to develop commercial programs,
coupled with launch of U.S. govt. payloads, may prove key to
financial success of American private launch companies, new report
said:  "The private launch industry is on the verge of becoming a
viable business operation.  However, its future lifeblood is heavily
dependent on launching of government payloads."

    Titled, "An Economic Perspective on the Future Commercialization
of Space," report was written by Henry Hertzfeld and Frank Baradino
of Gellman Research Assoc., Pittsburgh, for National Chamber of
Commerce Foundation.  Hertzfeld told us study was "an examination of
the economic framework for realizing space ventures" (see separate
story this issue).

    Fearing market shakeout, officials of 3 major launch companies
-- General Dynamics (GD), Martin Marietta (MM) and McDonnell Douglas
(MD),  -- already are reviewing study.  Art Conroy, MD commercial
space market analyst, said, "There are lots of doubts whether demand
will equal capacity" over next 5 years because number of competing
U.S. and foreign launch companies could make market "supply heavy."
Federal initiatives "would be welcomed," he said.

    Report said govt. has legitimate role in promoting or sponsoring
space activities because supplying "national transportation
infrastructure was always a government function."  For example, U.S.
paid high up-front costs for interstate highway system and thereby
encouraged creation of new jobs and methods of transporting goods
and new services.  It also "induced" commercialization of aviation
in 1920s-1930s through mail subsidies and "can do the same thing for
space" since boosters are "major highways and feeder systems -- the
infrastructure -- that must be in place if commercialization of
space" is to occur, study said.

    Foreign competition also provides justification for federal
assistance since U.S. private launch companies suffer from
disadvantage of competing against boosters owned by foreign govts.,
not by private foreign companies, report said, so U.S. could attempt
to channel benefits from its R&D to private sector.  In past,
foreign companies have benefited from such R&D by copying and
improving on U.S.-financed designs, building 2nd-generation hardware
at cheaper costs, study said, citing Ariane launch systems, Spot
satellites for remote sensing, Japanese communications equipment.

    Precise picture of profitable future investment prospects isn't
clear and companies are working to focus it, several industry
spokesmen said.  Conroy said:  "MD is working very hard to see how
it should position itself" to obtain sound market share.  GD
spokesman said:  "Potential markets must be identified before
changes in our marketing strategy can be made."  Conroy said he felt
lack of budget for Advanced Launch System (ALS) (SCB Dec 29 p6)
would intensify competition for federal payloads, creating situation
similar to Japan's, where number of companies in single industry
must battle for small number of contracts.  U.S. Dept. of
Transportation estimates worldwide civilian demand is only 15-25
satellites and suborbital payload launches through 1995.

    Report said reevaluation of govt. controls will prove necessary
as some activities transfer from public to private sector.  In past,
U.S.:  (1) Owned all launch vehicles and all satellites.  (2) Had to
manifest and process all satellites before launch.  (3) Set prices
for launching private payloads until recently.  Companies now are
free to declare their own launch prices and, thanks to efforts to
streamline liftoff management, number of special licenses and safety
inspections formerly required by govt. probably will be cut back.

    Proposals to build private launch facilities, if carried out,
could lower costs.  Hawaii, Fla. and Australia have been named as
possible sites.  Operation of private launch pads would eliminate
need for govt. to set fees for use of facilities on its property,
report said.  However, some high costs will remain because of
up-front investments required for space hardware that "cannot be
recouped if the project fails" and because of insurance
expenditures, study said.

PENTAGON SEEKS TO USE SPACE FACILITIES IN DRUG WAR ROLE

    Administration is studying Defense Dept. proposals that, if
approved, would allow use of photoreconnaissance and signals
intelligence (SIGINT) satellites to track international drug
traffickers, Pentagon officials said.  Defense Secy. Richard Cheney
and Gen. Colin Powell, head of Joint Chiefs of Staff, have endorsed
several drug surveillance schemes submitted to National Security
Council (NSC).  President Bush is expected to approve plans at NSC
meetings later this month, Air Force officials said.

    Last year DoD spurned urgings by members of Congress to assume
role in fighting drug wars.  However, faced with tightening budgets
and fading East-West tensions, Pentagon decided combating illicit
drugs offers possible way to fight fiscal cutbacks and retain
political clout, Air Force officials said.

    Details of proposals remain classified.  However, congressional
staffer cited 2 plans that would:  (1) Use high-resolution
photoreconnaissance satellites such as KH-11s to monitor shifting
location of drug bases or pinpoint drug processing labs in Latin
America and Caribbean.  (2) Relay satellite-gathered data to U.S.
Navy ships that would interdict drug shipments from Southeast Asia.

    Change in Pentagon's policy reportedly stems from Cheney and
Powell, who knew Administration was going to give high priority to
war on drugs.  Previous Defense Secys. Caspar Weinberger and Frank
Carlucci strongly opposed congressional suggestions of military
role.  Congress's interest in using military facilities became clear
in late Dec. 1988 when passage of Defense Authorization Act gave N.
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) antidrug role.  NORAD's
chief mission is to warn Pentagon of potential Soviet bomber or
missile attacks on N. America, yet its head, Air Force Gen. John
Piotrowski, recently said that fighting drugs has become its
"2nd-highest priority."

    NORAD is using ground radar, AWACs radar planes and fighters to
intercept drug trafficking in Caribbean but wants supplemental
network of satellites because of large area to be monitored.  Air
Force in Dec. 1988 asked for Space-Based Wide Area surveillance
system but budget cuts slowed program.  "It's still sitting there,
vegetating," Air Force spokesman said.  Version of space-based
system reportedly is among proposals submitted to NSC, another Air
Force spokesman said.

    Could existing DoD space assets handle new mission?  Some
expressed doubt.  Paul Stares, military space analyst at
Washington-based Brookings Institution, said:  "There aren't that
many satellites up there -- 3 KH-11s, an upgraded KH-11, 2 Magnums
[SIGINT birds] -- and most assignments for them were made way in
advance.  But you'd think that Pentagon officials would sit down
with Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA] experts and see if new
designated targets really could be monitored before submitting
proposals."

    Another expert said he thought Pentagon might be overburdened by
antidrug role.  Jeffrey Richelson, space intelligence expert at
Washington-based National Security Archive, said:  "How much can you
do before you overstretch your resources?  I think existing
[satellite] assets are already heavily tasked by various agencies
such as DIA and the CIA."

    New DoD program also could prove hard on birds, both said.
Recent proposals may mean military geosynchronous spy satellites
would have to be repositioned to cover targets, shortening their
lifespan, Stares said.  He said this probably could be avoided in
case of SIGINT or radar-imaging birds such as Lacrosse.  But
Richelson said SIGINT birds, not geosynchronous units, might require
repositioning:  "The KH-11s would probably stay where they are, but
not the SIGINTs, because in the past SIGINT birds in the Western
Hemisphere directed their coverage at the European-Asian landmass.
I would think some of the older versions such as Chalets or Vortexes
would have to be moved" and more might be needed.

    Heavy data flow could prevent launching of additional birds
because of Pentagon's concern that more information might be
generated than DoD would be able to analyze.  Richelson said:  "It
becomes a question of data management.  Even if you could launch an
additional satellite -- say it was a photoreconnaissance -- you
couldn't support it without turning half the country into
photointerpreters."

DEFENSE SPENDING CUTS LEAD TO PROPOSED SALE OF FORD AEROSPACE

    Ford Motor Co. said it's trying to sell Ford Aerospace Corp.
Confirming "ballpark" figure, official said unidentified potential
buyer had made $1.8 billion preliminary offer.  Disclosure followed
weeks of rumors and, as late as Jan. 5, denials from Ford Aerospace
spokesman that company was on block.  Questions remain whether sale
would include all Ford Aerospace holdings, including BDM
International, McLean, Va.;  Space Missions, Seabrook, Md.;
Washington Operations, company's east coast hq.  Company, with
Hughes and GM, is one of "Big 3" U.S. communications satellite
manufacturers.  Ford Aerospace spokeswoman said that company policy
prohibits comment on "speculative stories about acquisitions" but
that it would release public announcement "to clarify the rumors
soon."

    Proposed sale reportedly was undertaken for 2 reasons:  (1)
Uncertainties over govt. defense spending in wake of warming
East-West relations.  (2) Need to focus on automaking in face of
declining sales and intensifying global competition.  Prospectus
describing Aerospace unit reportedly had been distributed to
potential buyers, with Alcatel/Aerospatiale (AA), Boeing, Lockheed,
Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas and TRW among those that may be
interested.  Boeing, MD, MM and TRW declined comment, and Lockheed
said it hadn't heard of possible sale.  AA officials weren't
available.

    Ford is holding regularly scheduled board meeting Jan. 11
(Thurs., after our deadline) and former Ford Aerospace official said
prospectus for proposed sale "has been prepared" and would be on
agenda.  Company books then would be inspected by prospective
buyer's visiting team, ex-official said.  Goldman Sachs is acting as
Ford Motor financial adviser, he said.  Ford wouldn't be first
automaker to react to concern that thaw in East-West relations
spells reductions in federal spending on weaponry:  Chrysler Corp.
announced last month it was pulling out of defense business.
General Motors has denied any interest in selling its Hughes
Aircraft Co. subsidiary, which started laying off 6,000 of its
75,000 employes in 2nd half of 1989.

    Ford Aerospace received $1.7 billion in contracts, both civilian
and military, in fiscal 1989.  Company is "in good shape," source
close to Ford said.  It has 17,000 employees, and spokesman said 70%
of its business is with military.  Ford Aerospace produces Chaparral
and Sidewinder missiles and is heavily involved in satellite
manufacture.  It also runs military's jet pilot training ranges and
NASA's mission control center in Houston and is building parts of
U.S. space station to be orbited in late 1990s.

    Ford Motor Co.'s auto sales dropped 22% in late Dec. from same
period last year, but it reportedly was only domestic automaker to
increase its market share in 1989.  Ford, which has about $2 billion
cash on hand, acquired U.K.'s Jaguar auto company in Nov. for $2.5
billion and in Aug. purchased nation's 3rd largest independent
finance company, Associates First Capital Corp., for $3.4 billion.

    In other business, Ford Aerospace said it had completed
fabrication of 2nd Superbird satellite for Space Communications
Corp. (SCC), Japan, and had shipped it to launch site in Kourou,
French Guyana.  "This program has demonstrated its commitment to its
customers," Commercial Space Programs Operations Dir. Christopher
Hoeber said.  Built at Ford Aerospace's Space Systems Div. in Palo
Alto, Superbird B is scheduled for launch Feb. 20 aboard Ariane
booster;  it left San Jose Airport on chartered plane Jan. 6.

TRW AND MOTOROLA DEVELOP SUPER MICROPROCESSOR FOR SPACE SYSTEMS

    World's most advanced chip for communications satellites or
other spacecraft has been developed by Motorola and TRW as part of
Defense Dept.'s $1 billion Very High Speed Integrated Circuit
(VHSIC) program, TRW said.

    New device is 2.1-in. silicon square containing more than 4
million transistors that act as "brain" or central processor in
advanced digital signal processing systems such as those that
control communications satellites.  Chip, designated CPUAX (Central
Processing Unit - Arithmetic Extended) SuperChip, is able to perform
at world's fastest operating speed -- 200 million actions per sec.
TRW VHSIC Programs Dir. Thomas Zimmerman said:  "Two hundred million
operations per second mean the CPUAX... is the computational
equivalent of some supercomputers that fill an entire room, require
elaborate refrigeration systems and weigh several tons."  SuperChip
is able to repair itself during operation when used in conjunction
with TRW-Motorola Universal Processor chip consisting of 36,000
devices that test, monitor and configure "on-chip assets of CPUAX,"
company said.

    Potential uses are numerous, ranging from spacecraft to jet
fighters and missiles, Zimmerman said.  Tiny size and great power
mean it potentially could replace hundreds of thousands of
microprocessors currently used aboard spacecraft.  He said possible
commercial applications include any program where high speed, small
size and great computing power are required, including medical
diagnosis, complex imaging, factory operations, computer-aided
design.

    However, immediate commercial potential is limited, DoD
spokesman said. Only handful of new chips has been produced and they
must compete with cheaper, more readily available microprocessors.
Time also will be required to integrate new devices into existing
products and manufacturing processes, he said.  Team of DoD analysts
already is studying best potential market applications.

    Superchip is likely eventually to improve U.S. competitive
position in semiconductor field by reducing time, size and cost of
higher performance computing, said Richard Freeman, space analyst
and former Hughes vp.

    Space Shuttle Columbia was launched Jan. 9 on 10-day mission to

    Space Shuttle Columbia was launched Jan. 9 on 10-day mission to
retrieve Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) and launch Navy
communications satellite that was deployed next day.  Hughes bird,
costing $85 million, will complete network of 5 satellites Pentagon
uses to communicate with its military facilities worldwide.
Satellite was ejected by spring, activated by explosive devices that
spun it into space in what NASA officials call "frisbee"
deployment.  Columbia's next task is to retrieve LDEF and 57
Marshall Space Center experiments that are expected to provide key
insights into effects of space on materials (SCB Dec 29 p2).  LDEF
was predicted to enter earth's atmosphere in Feb. and burn up if not
rescued.  LDEF had been scheduled to be retrieved 10 months after
being placed in orbit in 1984 but scheduling problems and 1986
Challenger disaster caused 5-year delay.  Orbiter must be careful in
rescuing satellite since craft could be in fragile condition, NASA
said.  Shuttle was to retrieve LDEF using remote manipulator system
(RMS).  It first was to pass below spacecraft and circle up and over
it.  Called R-Bar approach, this doesn't require close-in
flyaround.  Maneuver was to face Columbia's payload bay toward earth
with LDEF between and perpendicular to earth and orbiter.  When
orbiter is 400 ft. from LDEF with RMS arm extended, yaw maneuver
will place satellite directly above crew compartment, allowing Cmdr.
Dan Brandenstein and Pilot James Wetherbee to fly at same speed and
direction as LDEF.  Mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar was to direct
RMS toward grapple completion while LDEF was 35 ft. above orbiter.
LDEF will remain in Columbia's payload bay during routine postflight
servicing at Edwards Air Force Base, Cal.  Columbia's 10-day flight
is 2nd-longest in 33 shuttle missions.

    Olin Corp. announced it plans to double capacity for production
of Ultra Pure hydrazine in Lake Charles, La.  Pres. Robert Yohe said
Air Force recently awarded Olin one-year contract to produce 42,000
lbs. for use in satellite propellant systems.  Expansion, which it
said will boost production capacity to 100,000 lbs. per year, is
expected to be on line by May.  Yohe said there was "excellent
potential" for special grade mixture to be used for military, NASA
and commercial satellites' attitude control and orbit correction
systems.  Olin said patented process produces aniline-free product
that doesn't leave carbon deposits on engine nozzles, extending
useful operating life of satellites and enhancing engine performance.

    Outdated production modes of U.S. private launch industry are

    Outdated production modes of U.S. private launch industry are
acting to boost launch costs, think-tank space expert and industry
official said.  Angelo Codevilla, senior research fellow at Hoover
Institute, Palo Alto, and former Senate Intelligence Committee
staffer, said boosters aren't built efficiently because "there
aren't any assembly lines."  Instead, components are processed in
widely separated parts of "enormous" company compounds so process
works "with all the efficiency of a cottage industry," he said.  Art
Conroy, McDonnell Douglas commercial space analyst, agreed:  "We
have a cottage industry approach, and the only thing that will ever
change it is a traumatic recession."  "Nowhere in the space world,"
Codevilla said, "does industry work on advanced manufacturing
patterns, with the exception of the assembly line Hughes uses to
build its communications satellites."  Outdated production methods
are caused chiefly by reluctance of govt. to "make predictable
long-term investment" for large volume purchase of launchers that
would justify expense to companies of establishing assembly lines
similar to those used by Soviet Union to produce Proton and other
boosters, he said.

sales of its rocket motors, following disastrous Oct. 5 fire that
damaged nation's first privately developed rocket (SET-1) as it was
about to be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Cal.  SET-1 was
to have been suborbital flight, carrying 2 payloads and designed to
test SDI missile detectors on orbiting satellites (SCB Oct 6 p1).
Air Force said damage to pad was minimal and Amroc announced it
would continue with modified version of 16-ton booster,  However, it
soon began reducing its work force.   Company warned that if it were
liquidated, creditors could expect "in the area of 5 cents on the
dollar."

    Spot 2 launch Jan. 10 was scrubbed when final checkout of Ariane

    Spot 2 launch Jan. 10 was scrubbed when final checkout of Ariane
40, first Ariane 4 to be flown without strap-on boosters, disclosed
"deviations" in gimbal inertial platform, Arianespace said.
Additional tests began at Kourou, French Guyana, but no new liftoff
date was announced pending results of check.  Flight will carry 4
microsats for Amsat N.A. and 2 for U. of Surrey, England.

    Martin Marietta (MM) Titan 3 booster finally achieved maiden

    Martin Marietta (MM) Titan 3 booster finally achieved maiden
launch Dec. 31 at 7:07 p.m. EST from Cape Canaveral, Fla., following
9 postponements (beginning Dec. 7) because of high upper-level winds
and bad weather.  Upper stages of booster reached orbit of 117-437
miles within 20 min. of liftoff, company said.  Rocket deployed
Japanese JCSat-2 and U.K. Skynet satellites, and birds reached
geosynchronous orbit Jan. 2, MM said.  Japanese Communications
Satellite, builder of JCSat-2, and British govt., owner of Skynet,
will share $125 million cost of booster and launch.

    U.S. satellites and boosters will dominate worldwide commercial

    U.S. satellites and boosters will dominate worldwide commercial
space markets until 1994, when heavy supply and fading demand could
make attracting buyers difficult, European Space survey found.
"World Space Industry Survey:  10-Year Outlook," released last month
by Paris-based Euroconsult, said world market for telecommunications
satellites reached $6 billion for sixty-nine 2nd-generation
satellites, up from $2 billion for 37 first-generation birds.
Average unit price increased to $70 million from $63 million.
Launches of commercial geostationary payloads remained largest
market segment, with 90% consisting of communications satellites and
rest meteorological birds, survey said:  "A new period of high
activity is in progress and should last until 1994."  In 1989-2000
period, market value of launches of 173 satellites should reach
$9.2-$11.7 billion, with number of liftoffs estimated to stay at 20
annually until 1995, after which total should decline to 10 per year
by 2000.  By then new generation of birds should be operational,
survey said.  Report predicted that total market value of
communications satellites would peak at $13.7 billion by 2000, with
launch of 153-195 birds at average of $70 million each.  U.S. owed
dominance to military payloads, survey said:  "The military market
in the U.S., which is nearly 10 times larger than the civilian
market, is essential to the U.S. communications industry by virtue
of its size."  Break-even point for remote sensing and
meteorological birds won't be reached until 2nd half of 1990s with
survey predicting 2 satellites annually for civilian meteorology
birds and 2-3 per year for remote sensing.  Stiffer competition
among remote sensing systems should be feature of 1990s with
introduction of Soviet satellites.  But report said only Landsat and
Spot are "systems of worldwide... commercial scope."  Microgravity
market faces years of gradual growth before reaching profitability,
study said, projecting that big 3 U.S. launch companies -- General
Dynamics, Martin Marietta and McDonnell Douglas -- would dominate
booster market along with Europe's Arianespace.  Report said U.S.
companies would benefit from backlog of orders caused by failure of
expendable launch vehicles following 1986 Challenger disaster.
