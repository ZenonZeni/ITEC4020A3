<b>Detoxify, Relax Muscles, and Enhance Immunity</b><p>

Physicians have long known of the many therapeutic benefits of steam heat, also known as hyperthermia or heat stress detoxification. Similarly, the benefits of aromatherapy—the inhalation of the vapors of essential plant oils—are widely recognized among alternative practitioners. Now Variel Health International has combined both modalities in the form of the aromaSpa™ aromatic steam capsule suitable for home use as a portable health spa.<p>
The unit stands 5’6”, weighs about 68 pounds, may be easily disassembled, and plugs into any standard 115- volt socket. Its walls and sliding door are made of transparent polycarbonate used for airplane windows. The steam generator and aroma diffuser are located on the floor of the unit. Any of at least 250 aromatherapy oils may be used, singly or in combination, to support muscle relaxation, detoxification, and immune system stimulation, or for eliminating fatigue, lifting mood, revitalizing skin, or general rejuvenation.<p>
Other self-care benefits include general mind and body relaxation, stress reduction, energizing, emotional cleansing, and “customized personal pampering,” depending on the aromatherapy formula used, says Variel’s Cathy Dammann.<p>
In the self-contained aromatherapy and steam heat diffuser, soothing mists carrying aromatic molecules envelop the entire body surface for maximum absorption and benefit.<p>
The aromaSpa uses one quart of distilled water (preferable to chlorinated and fluoridated tap water) for a 40-minute steam heat session and can reach inside temperatures of 115°-120°F within about 10 minutes. These temperatures are necessary as hyperthermia provides its benefits by temporarily raising the body temperature to between 101° and 103°F and inducing perspiration. Clinical information suggests that steam heat may have therapeutic advantages over the dry heat associated with most saunas, says Dammann.<p>
The aromaSpa was tested in 1994 by Jerry Schindler, Ph.D., director of the Sports Health Science Human Performance Lab at Life College School of Chiropractic in Marietta, Georgia. Dr. Schindler reported that the unit was effective in decreasing the risk of everyday and athletic injuries, primarily by increasing muscle flexibility, blood flow, and oxygen delivery to the muscles. <p>
Dr. Schindler demonstrated these benefits by way of thermographic studies (which register nerve sense pathways) comparing the left and right sides of a test subject’s body. Individuals whose thermographic readings are asymmetrical (indicating imbalances and sensory interference) are prone to injury, says Dr. Schindler. Symmetrical patterns were achieved after 30 minutes in the aromaSpa.<p>
According to Dam-mann, aroma steam therapy can also reduce lactic acid buildup in muscles following exercise, thereby preventing soreness. The approach may be effective in reducing cellulite (lumpy fat areas in the skin), especially when used with rosemary, sandalwood, juniper, geranium, or lemon essential oils. These can  produce detoxifying and water-draining effects in only 10 minutes compared to standard hot body wraps, which require 60 minutes, says Dammann. 	<p>
Steam heat therapy may increase blood circulation and heighten immune response by stimulating white blood cell production, Dammann says. The aromaSpa is now being used experimentally by patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, she reports. According to Zand Gard, M.D., “the only detoxification program that has proven successful in removing fat-stored toxins from the body is hyperthermia.” The use of the essential oils of clove, cinnamon, melissa, or lavender have been clinically shown to benefit  bronchial conditions as effectively as antibiotics, especially when delivered by steam heat, Dammann says.<p>

<font size="+1"><b>MAKING CANCER TREATMENT RATIONAL</b></font><br>
<b>Lab Test Accurately Predicts Outcomes</b><p>

Conventional cancer treatment routinely administers powerful and toxic chemotherapy drugs to cancer patients based on statistical probabilities that these drugs will have some effect. Yet, often patients find out that particular cancer drugs are ineffective for them only after taking them and enduring their toxic side effects. <p>
A new lab test takes the blind flying out of conventional and alternative cancer treatments. It’s called the “Ex Vivo Apoptotic Assay” and was developed by Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. Dr. Nagourney, a board-certified oncologist, hematologist, and pharmacology professor, is founder and medical director of Rational Therapeutics of Long Beach, California, which provides the test. <p>
Apoptosis (pronounced ap-op-TOW-sis) is a clinical term that means “programmed cell death.” The test is a short-term measure of the ability of a substance to produce cancer cell death. “Our role is to inject some logic and sense into a rather hectic and haphazard administration of therapies,” says Dr. Nagourney. “We call our approach ‘rational therapeutics’ because we think it’s a very intelligent way to deal with cancer.”<p>
Let’s say your physician tells you that the use of adriamycin (a chemotherapy drug) induces remissions in 38% of women with breast cancer. How can you tell in advance if you’re part of the 38% for whom it works or the 62% for whom it has no effect? <p>
“We can now determine things in a test tube painlessly for a patient that they would only be able to find out if they went through the treatments,” Dr. Nagourney says.  <p>
Based on their cumulative results, Dr. Nagourney’s team has compiled a bell-shaped data curve that shows the range of sensitivity and resistance to different drugs among individuals with the same kinds of cancer. From this he can predict that out of 100 women with breast cancer, perhaps 35 will have cancer cell death taking 0.15 mcg/ml of doxorubicin, while 25 will require only 0.05 mcg/ml, and still others will need 1.0 mcg/ml.<p>
The test evaluates the likely effect on human cancer tissue from any of about 70 chemotherapy drugs, given singly or in combination. It can also test botanical substances such as betulinic acid (from white birch bark), Alvium (a 12-herb formula), antineoplastons, interferons, or, theoretically, any substance capable of killing cancer cells. All that’s required is a living tissue sample of cancer cells obtained by biopsy (or blood sample, in the case of leukemia) from the patient. <p>
The goal is to see which substances produce cancer cell death during a 72 to 96 hour process in which the cancer is grown in a test tube. The result objectively indicates the likely human response of an individual patient to a specific drug, says Dr. Nagourney. On this basis, the physician may then tailor a customized treatment plan with a fair measure of assurance that it will be effective. <p>
On the average, Dr. Nagourney says, a patient who is found “sensitive” (responsive) to an identified drug or substance is 2-3 times more likely to respond favorably when that drug is given clinically. This also means that the test can produce 2-3 times better outcomes in patients than the national averages reported by the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Nagourney notes. Generally, the assay’s ability to predict outcomes was scored at 19 out of 21 in a test published in the Journal of Hematology and Blood Transfusion in 1990, while between 85% and 95% of specimens submitted provide successful studies.<p>
For example, a man with colon cancer was tested for sensitivity to 16 chemotherapy drugs. The results indicated his system was “resistant” (unresponsive) to 6 drugs, including carmustin, nitrogen mustard, and taxol, and that he had an “extreme drug resistance” to doxorubicin, “with a near-zero response probability to that agent.” The assay also indicated the Ex Vivo Best Regimen; in this case, a combination of 2 drugs whose effects would be strengthened for this individual when applied together. <p>
While Rational Therapeutics does not prescribe medicines for cancer as a complement to the test results, clinicians will suggest “a carefully developed antioxidant and nutrition program designed to aid in the patient’s recovery and minimize the toxic side effects of chemotherapy treatments,” says Dr. Nagourney. It’s a holistic approach in that “we make a global or ‘whole person’ assessment of each patient,” so that treatment can be objectively individualized. In this way, says Dr. Nagourney, the field of cancer treatment can be “advanced by studying the most rational and reliable indicators of positive cancer response: each patient’s own cancer cells.” <p>

<a name="KyolicGarlic"></a>
<font size="+1"><b>KYOLIC GARLIC EXTRACT EFFECTIVE FOR CANCER</b></font><p>

Long appreciated as a folk remedy believed to benefit the immune system and to help ward off colds, garlic’s proven ability to work as a cancer inhibitor and as a valuable adjunct to alternative cancer therapy is now highlighted by cumulative scientific research. <p>
Much of this progressive research began in the 1950s in Japan, a country known for its medicinal use of garlic. In 1954, a German researcher joined forces with Japan’s garlic expert, Manji Wakunaga. Together they established a method of growing by organic means in the virgin woodlands of Hokkai-do, Japan, a high potency garlic, free of pesticides, chemical seed treatment, and inorganic fertilizers. Wakunaga then perfected a 20-month cold-aging process by which garlic’s offensive odor was naturally removed and the herb’s healing properties strengthened. <p>
The result is Kyolic® Aged Garlic Extract™, for which Wakunaga received a special industry award from the Japanese government in 1991. The product is now widely available in liquid, tablet, or capsule form. Why take a garlic pill when you can eat fresh raw garlic? Evidence suggests that the cold-aging process may actually enhance garlic’s medicinal qualities, rendering it more suitable than the raw form. <p>
Specifically, the aging process removes garlic’s harsh, irritating, and toxic compounds  and its strong odor; it also converts certain components  (such as alliin and allicin) into valuable, safe, and stable  compounds (such as thioallyl). “These compounds represent the activated, predigested, readily bioavailable, and effective forms of garlic’s active principles,” says Brenda Lynn Petesch, Wakunaga’s research and development nutritionist. <p>
Data supporting garlic’s medicinal claims comes from human, animal, and cell studies, says Petesch. Studies of eating habits in China and Italy, where garlic consumption is high, established that the risk of stomach cancer declined by about 50% among those people with a high raw garlic intake. Residents of Cangshan County in China regularly ate 20 g of garlic daily and enjoyed the lowest death rate due to stomach cancer in China, while residents in Qixia County, where garlic consumption was minimal, had a death rate from stomach cancer that was 13 times higher.<p>
Animal studies have shown that aged garlic extract appears to stop the growth of cancers of the breast, bladder, skin, and colon, and the initial development of malignant tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and lungs. One study involving mice who received 20 once-weekly injections of diallyl sulfide (a garlic constituent) showed that this supplementation reduced the frequency of colon and rectal cancer by 74%.<p>
Research involving human cell cultures in test tubes indicates that garlic may inhibit the proliferation of breast, skin, and nerve cancer cells. A study at the National Medical Center Hospital in Japan showed that the garlic extract (with added vitamins B1 and B12 and liver extract) produced a “moderately effective” response in 70% of patients. <p>
Garlic helped reduce anorexia and fatigue and the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy for patients with head and neck tumors; it reduced the toxic effect on the heart of a cancer drug called doxorubicin; and according to researcher Dr. Minoru Toriyama, it enhanced “the patient’s will to fight against his disease.”<p>
According to Petesch, Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract may produce these anticancer benefits  by speeding up the excretion of chemical carcinogens from the cells, by protecting DNA from carcinogenic damage, by enhancing the activity of enzymes that detoxify poisons, and by boosting the vitality of the immune system. Garlic protects DNA by blocking the toxic effects of aflatoxin, a fungus found on peanuts and grains that would otherwise help precipitate harmful genetic mutations. <p>
Other proven health benefits attributable to Kyolic, says Petesch, summarizing Wakunaga’s research results, include an ability to promote energy, protect against free radicals in the blood, detoxify and protect the liver, minimize immune suppression as a result of radiation, curtail the growth of the yeast Candida albicans, reduce the secretion of stress hormones, increase levels of beneficial intestinal bacteria, and protect the heart by inhibiting inappropriate blood clotting.<p>

<a name="HomeoHerbs"></a>
<font size="+1"><b>HOMEOPATHIC HERBS FOR CANCER & FATIGUE</b></font><br>
<b>Argentina’s HANSI Gets Remissions</b><p>

The name HANSI refers to a series of homeopathically prepared herbs that have been proven effective in the treatment of cancer and chronic fatigue. The product was developed by Argentinian biologist Juan Jose Hirschmann who named it after his childhood nickname Hansi, which is German for “little John.” But the name also refers to Homeopathic Activator of the Natural Immune System, which concisely describes the product.<p>
When Hirschmann first introduced HANSI in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1990, so great was the demand for this alternative cancer formula that even with 40 physicians on staff, his clinic reached operating capacity in its first week, registering, at peak time, 1200 patients a day. <p>
Since then, says David C. Christner, managing director of Hansi International, Ltd., in Sarasota, Florida, an estimated 100,000 cancer patients have used HANSI with good results, indicated most notably in dramatic increases in levels and activity of natural killer cells, central to the immune response to cancer.	<p>
“A large amount of evidence is leading to the conclusion that HANSI is a powerful enhancer of the human system,” Christner says.<p>
The basic product starts with about 10 components, then is adjusted acording to whether it will be delivered orally or by injection and whether it is to address cancer, chronic fatigue, AIDS, asthma, or other conditions, Christner says. For example, the basic HANSI contains low potency homeopathic dilutions (4X to 11X)  of mostly rain forest and desert plants such as Cacti grandiflora (cactus), aloe, arnica, lachesis, licopodium, and others, in a 2-8% alcohol base tincture. HANSI formula variations include these plus Colocinthis, Pulmonaria reticulosa, Berberis vulgaris, and silica.<p>
Hirschmann and Christner emphasize their company’s commitment to performing the “hard science” to provide physicians with “incontrovertible evidence” that HANSI gets results. In a landmark study in 1992 involving 87 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (which is usually fatal within 3-6 months and presents a cure rate of 1%), 60 of the patients taking HANSI daily remained alive one year after the study began. Two years later, more than 50% of the patients were still alive and well, says study director, Cesar Bertacchini, M.D., of the Instituto de Medicina Integracion in Buenos Aires, Argentina.<p>
Further, appetite remained stable in 57% of the cases and increased in 7%, 73% had no pain or only mild pain, 56% reported no nausea or vomiting, and 36% experienced a reduction in these symptoms. HANSI was able to stop weight loss (which is typical of advanced cancer) for 34%, and 11% gained some weight. Patients receiving HANSI did not have chemotherapy or radiation during this treatment. In addition, several studies have shown conclusively that HANSI has no toxicity or secondary effects, said Dr. Bertacchini. <p>
Subsequent studies indicate that HANSI produces a greater tolerance for radiation and chemotherapy, both subjectively and in terms of the return of a patient’s blood to “normal” or pretreatment status. Early results from a 1995 study at the Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research in Plantation, Florida, involving breast cancer in mice demonstrated that HANSI treatment produced a 40% decrease in tumor size in 30 days.  	<p>
Hansi International is presently engaged in several key research projects in conjunction with the University of California at Irvine, College of Medicine, where HANSI’s efficacy in treating chronic fatigue syndrome will be evaluated. Chief researcher, Darryl M. See, M.D., comments: “Over the past two years I have been involved in screening various herbs and homeopathic preparations for in vitro immune-stimulating effects. Among the 200 or so I have tested, HANSI proved to be among the most effective in increasing natural killer cell function.” Natural killer cells are key cancer-fighters in the immune system.<p>
Christner says that HANSI, for injection or intravenous infusion, is available to people in the U.S. in accordance with the FDA’s “Personal Use Exemption” which permits importation by individuals of a 3-month supply. On the other hand, HANSI oral formulas (Rejuvenator Formula “J” and “H” for chronic fatigue, arthritis, or immune boosting) are, technically, available to anyone as over-the-counter remedies, without restrictions, says Christner. However, oral HANSI is absorbed more slowly and dissipates faster than the injected form. At present, HANSI in all applications is fully legal in Mexico, the Bahamas, Argentina, and Hungary. <p>
